Utilizing an elastic mask, we can also produce facial muscular traction in an intend to approximate the alveolar cleft segments.\n\n【2】The nasal stent is initially placed at the external border of the alar nose. The aim is to obtain muscle and mucosa relaxation, to produce the internal nasal bridge elimination, preventing the alar collapse.\n\n【3】In a second step, the odonto-pediatrician centralizes the nasal component to ameliorate the alar cartilage breaking down. If this modification is achieved during the first month, tissue distortion can be eliminated from the cartilage memory.\n\n【4】In posterior visits, the expert will follow with the centralization of the nasal device, to achieve a longer collumelar side by pushing up and repositioning the crus medialis.\n\n【5】Once all these improvements are accomplished, the directional component must be substituted by a longer one, with the aim of obtaining the nasal tip projection. In that way, the nasal device also could help to produce labial muscle traction and a subsidiary vertical high increasing of the lip in both sides of the cleft (Bennun and Langsam 2015 ) .\n\n【6】Fig. 13.5\n\n【7】( a , b ) The oral plate is in place and the elastic facial mask has been installed.

Soft tissues remodeling and repositioning helps to eliminate the intranasal bridge\n\n【14】Fig. 13.9\n\n【15】( a , b ) Substantial modifications in all tissues distortion can be observed after 1 month of treatment. Lip and nose remodeling process has finalized, and the baby is ready to be reconstructed. The advantages of this procedure may be considered not only from soft tissue perspective but also from bone perspective\n\n【16】Fig. 13.10\n\n【17】( a , b ) Bilateral complete case, with a severe rotated and protruded premaxilla.

The same patient treated by presurgical dynamic remodeling, and ready for the reconstructive procedure. Our strategy is to presurgically reconstruct the new columella and nasal tip by remodeling adjacent skin and mucosa, and anatomically repositioning the alar cartilages, to make surgical correction less aggressive\n\n【22】Fig. 13.12\n\n【23】( a , b ) The principle of DPNR technique is to employ suctioning and swallowing to create a controlled, discontinuous, and directional force to be applied or transmitted to the nasolabial structures\n\n【24】13.8 Pediatric Anesthesia Considerations\n----------------------------------------\n\n【25】Induction anesthesia was safely performed by inhalation with gradually increasing doses of halothane or sevoflurane. Intravenous access was secured after an adequate depth anesthesia was achieved. Endotracheal intubation was performed under deep volatile anesthesia. The hydration protocol included 13 ml/kg/hour with 0.85% NaCl physiological solution. A neuromuscular blocking agent was used to relax muscles: atracurium besylate at doses between 0 and 0.4 mg/kg, fentanyl citrate 1–3 ug/kg, and nalbuphine hydrochloride 30 ug/kg.\n\n【26】Regional anesthesia of both the face and palate were performed using superficial safe techniques by slowly infiltrating small volumes of local anesthetic with epinephrine to obtain a good and persistent neurosensory block.\n\n【27】At the end of the surgical procedure, we stop administering anesthetics and proceed with ventilatory recovery, administering antagonists (atropine-neostigmine in doses of 10 and 30 ug/kg respectively). Extubation is performed in forced inspiration, and the patient is transferred to the postanesthesia care unit, where the baby recovers with its parents.\n\n【28】Surgical intervention time was between 49 ± 13 minutes for unilateral cleft lips and cleft palate repair, compared to 75 ± 28 minutes for bilateral cleft lip, and 68 ± 31 for revisions (Moggi et al. 2015 ).\n\n【29】Facial and palatal regional anesthesia is the key in general anesthesia to let the use of fewer central nervous system depressant drugs, allowing for a faster recovery and facilitating the possibility of moving these procedures to outpatient surgeries (Bingham 2012 ).\n\n【30】Ambulatory surgery is increasing worldwide, reducing hospital stays, lessening family separation, lowering costs in health insurance, and thus in the long run providing the desired results (Maestre 2000 ).\n\n【31】Understanding the physiopathology of these malformations facilitates the reduction of risks in nutrition. These maneuvers lead to the implementation of better policies in healthcare (Kundra et al. 2009 ; Paine et al. 2014 ) .\n\n【32】Fig. 13.14\n\n【33】( a , b ) Regional anesthesia procedure in cleft lip/palate reconstruction\n\n【34】13.9 Unilateral Cleft Lip and Nose Repair\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【35】Since Millard 通用删除7(英):<u>( 1958 )</u> introduced his rotation advancement technique, stability and predictability have been much easier to achieve.\n\n【36】To provide consistent results that not only repair the congenital defects but also achieve symmetry and esthetic balance, proper education, training, and a constant flow of patients are necessary (Gillies and Millard 1957).\n\n【37】These combined procedures are generally performed at 3 months of age (Laberge 2007 ).\n\n【38】The size of the airway is drastically changed after lip closure and nostril reshaping, and there is more resistance to breathing. In these young babies, airway monitoring and specialized nurses are essential in the immediate post-op. Fortunately, if the baby is awake and without pain, the adapting process is very short, and the patient can initiate breast or bottle feeding after 30 min.\n\n【39】We believe that dynamic presurgical nasoalveolar remodeling with primary reconstruction of the lip and nose, in one setting, is the best option for children presenting with a unilateral cleft lip and palate (Bennun and Genecov 2015 ). Primary bone graft and alveolar gap closure, in the area of dental germs, do not seem to be necessary. A conservative high gingivoperioplasty, with muscular nasal floor reconstruction, to prevent oronasal fistula is recommended. Fewer revisions mean less scarring and more predictable results. The first team definitely has the best chance of a good result .\n\n【40】Fig. 13.15\n\n【41】( a , b ) Unilateral complete cleft lip repair. The rotation/advancement procedure illustration.

One-year post-op result\n\n【50】13.10 Bilateral Cleft Lip and Nose Repair\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【51】The deformity is characterized by a protruding maxilla, prolabium lacking muscle fibers with a blunted white roll, vertically long lateral lip elements widely spaced due to discontinuity of the orbicularis oris, short columella, flattened nose, and abnormally positioned alar cartilages. A single-stage bilateral cleft lip and nose repair to correct the deformity and allow for proper growth is believed to be better for future appearance and function.\n\n【52】This concept is based on two major advances in the surgical management of bilateral cleft lip over the past quarter century.\n\n【53】First is the understanding of the need for preoperative remodeling of the cleft maxillary segments and nasal/labial tissues.\n\n【54】Second is the recognition of the principles of bilateral labial repair, especially the significance of simultaneous correction of the nasal deformity (Mulliken 2009 ).\n\n【55】A one-stage procedure to reconstruct complete and incomplete bilateral cleft lip and nose deformities is presented. Emphasis was made on closure of the lip muscles, correction of the nostril floor, correction of the alveolar cleft, as well as reconstruction of the nose through an intranasal approach (Bennun and Sandor 2015 ) .\n\n【56】Fig. 13.20\n\n【57】( a , b ) Mulliken-type variant illustration.

A natural nose conformation and symmetry can be observed\n\n【64】Fig. 13.24\n\n【65】( a , b ) Bilateral case presurgical view. Four-year follow-up view\n\n【66】13.11 One-Stage Complete Cleft Palate Repair\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【67】Basically there are three groups of palate repair techniques.\n\n【68】One is for hard palate repair, the second for soft palate repair, and the third based on the surgical schedule.\n\n【69】Hard palate repair techniques are Veau–Wardill–Kilner V-Y, von Langenbeck, two-flap, alveolar extension variant, vomer flap, raw area free palatoplasty, and so on.\n\n【70】The soft palate techniques are intravelar veloplasty, double-opposing Z-plasty, radical muscle dissection, primary pharyngeal flap, and so on. And the protocol-based techniques are Schweckendiek’s, Malek’s, whole in one, modified schedule with palatoplasty before lip repair, and so on.\n\n【71】Today, the majority accept 8–14 months as the optimum age for palate closure. Ideally, the development of babbling should be considered as an indicator of the best time to reconstruct the palate.\n\n【72】Conventional methods of cleft lip repair deprive the anterior (buccolingual) alveolar mucoperiosteum of blood supply from the facial–internal maxillary arcade. Six months later, at palatoplasty, lingual incisions permanently isolate the lingual mucoperiosteum from its blood supply: the greater palatine artery. The osteogenic alveolar mucoperiosteum is thus converted from a richly supplied boundary zone between the two angiosomes into an isolated tissue dependent on osseus ackflow.\n\n【73】Cleft-sided growth disturbance is considered from this perspective. Subperiosteal techniques that preserve the blood supply to this tissue are considered in a sequential plan of cleft management (Carstens 1999 ; Rossell-Perry et al. 2015 ) .\n\n【74】Fig. 13.25\n\n【75】( a , b ) A correct dental arch alignment at the moment of total palate closure is essential to perform a proper procedure\n\n【76】Fig. 13.26\n\n【77】( a , b ) Anatomical concepts and irrigation preservation are transcendental to prevent complications and sequels\n\n【78】Fig. 13.27\n\n【79】( a , b ) Carstens variant illustration. The alveolar expanded palatal incisions can be observed. Bigger flaps make the total closure easier and help surgeons to prevent sequels\n\n【80】Fig. 13.28\n\n【81】( a , b ) Unilateral complete case presurgical view. Immediate post-op view. Primary and secondary palates have been totally closed in a one-step procedure\n\n【82】Fig. 13.29\n\n【83】( a , b ) Bilateral complete case presurgical view. A total palate closure has been achieved in a one-step procedure. A two-plane muscular reconstruction has been performed\n\n【84】Fig. 13.30\n\n【85】( a , b ) Unilateral and bilateral 7-year follow-ups. No anterior fistula, no transversal retraction, and a good velar elongation can be observed\n\n【86】13.12 Discussion\n----------------\n\n【87】Some types of surgery performed on the tip of the nose, such as secondary rhinoplasty on cleft lip and palate (CLP) patients, may have an uncertain end result due to difficulty in maintaining the surgically created status constant over time.\n\n【88】Experience has shown that application of a dynamic nasal splint has contributed efficiently in maintaining the surgical results by opposing healing contraction (Cenzi and Guarda 1996 ).\n\n【89】Based on a literature review, nasal molding seems to be more beneficial and effective with better long-term results (Matsuo et al. 1991 ; Singh et al. 2005 ).\n\n【90】Hence, it can be concluded that not only the interdisciplinary approach but also a thorough knowledge of the changing concepts of nasoalveolar molding and timing of initiation is essential to improve results (Matsuo et al. 1989 ; Abbott and Meara 2012 ).\n\n【91】Considering the physiopathology of the nasolabial deformity, it is clear how important early prevention of unfavorable factors is. Taking into consideration wound healing concepts, we can conclude that premature treating of tissues “without memory” allows avoidance of alar cartilage deformity fixing.\n\n【92】The DPNR technique does not rely on the relatively static force exerted by an orthopedic plate held in place by means of tape or adhesives.\n\n【93】Introduced changes make it more comfortable to keep the oral plate in the mouth longer without being expelled, and also it means the use of tape or adhesives is not necessary.\n\n【94】A new, well-adapted nasal component allows better remodeling effects, reducing the time and frequency of visits and avoiding tissue lesions.\n\n【95】The device can be employed in any child and in any type of cleft, and a completed successful treatment results in fewer economic and social costs than any other described procedure.\n\n【96】The possibility of easily modifying the device size and impact direction allows step-by-step treatment of all the components of nasal distortion, reproducing the described distortion process in an opposing manner.\n\n【97】The possibility of achieving a well-conformed and repositioned alar cartilage with more relaxed nose and labial tissues lets the normal airway passage through this nose allowing normal facial growths and development.\n\n【98】Also it avoids aggressive surgical dissection and diminishing scars, preventing sequels.\n\n【99】A reduced number of surgical procedures and the shortening of treatments contribute to reduced social and monetary expenses and facilitate normal social insertion of the child at school age .\n\n【100】Fig. 13.31\n\n【101】( a , b ) Five-year follow-up in a unilateral incomplete case.

From there, the protein must travel through each of the compartments of the Golgi complex , finally arriving at the trans Golgi network (TGN) before being transported to the plasma membrane, lysosome, or vacuole. The collections of membrane-bound organelles that participate in exocytosis are part of the endomembrane system . It is generally accepted that proteins move along the exocytic pathway inside small transport vesicles. Transport vesicles are formed through a process of “budding” from the membrane of the RER or Golgi, capturing protein cargo in the process. Fusion of the vesicles with the membrane of the target organelle releases the protein cargo into that compartment. These vesicles carry a collection of peripheral proteins on the cytoplasmic side of their membranes, forming a “coat.” COPI and COPII are the two distinct types of coated vesicles associated with transport between the RER and the Golgi complex.\n\n【4】Three models were developed to explain the role of coated vesicles in exocytosis. The first model proposed that COPII vesicles were responsible for the anterograde (forward) movement of materials in the cell. The second model proposed that both COPI and COPII vesicles moved material in parallel, independent of anterograde pathways. The third model proposed a sequential role for coated vesicles. In this model the COPII vesicles carry material from the RER to an intermediate compartment. COPI vesicles are then formed from the intermediate compartment to carry the material to the cis Golgi. The work presented in this case study seeks to determine which of these models is correct.\n\n【5】▪ Research/review the types of proteins that are synthesized on the RER.\n\n【6】▪ Summarize how a newly synthesized protein is modified from the time it enters the lumen of the RER to the time it reaches the trans Golgi network.\n\n【7】▪ Describe another example of a coated vesicle found in cells.\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is an envelope virus that typically infects animals such as horses and cattle. One of the important viral proteins produced when the virus infects a host cell is a transmembrane glycoprotein called VSV-G. VSV-G has become a model protein for use in studies of exocytosis. A temperature-sensitive (ts) version of VSV-G has been developed. Ts-045-G protein misfolds when it is exposed to a temperature of 39.5°C. At this nonpermissive temperature, the misfolded protein accumulates in the RER. Shifting the temperature to 31°C, the permissive temperature , allows the ts-045-G protein to fold properly and move to the cell’s plasma membrane. The movement of VSV-G through the cell can also be blocked by incubating cells at 15 or 20°C, causing the protein to accumulate in an intermediate compartment between the RER and Golgi or the trans Golgi network, respectively.\n\n【10】The gene for ts-045-G was engineered to include the sequence of green fluorescent protein ( GFP ). GFP is a small, 238 amino acid protein that fluoresces when exposed to blue light. The sequence for GFP was added to the carboxy terminus of ts-045-G, making a chimeric protein (ts-G-GFP <sub>ct </sub> ). The relative location of the cargo protein ts-G-GFP <sub>ct </sub> could then be followed and compared with the location of different coat proteins inside the cell. Colocalization or the overlap of fluorescence signal from two or more fluorescent labels is used as an indication that the things being tracked are closely associated in the cell.\n\n【11】▪ How does a virus gain an “envelope?” What implications does this have on the synthesis and secretion of VSV-G protein?\n\n【12】▪ Sketch out the pathway that VSV-G would take starting at the RER and ending at the plasma membrane?\n\n【13】▪ Conduct an online search for images of the structure of VSV-G. Describe the structure of the viral protein.\n\n【14】▪ Speculate on why an elevated temperature might cause a protein to misfold.\n\n【15】Methods\n-------\n\n【16】### Cell culture and gene expression\n\n【17】Vero cells, a tissue culture cell line derived from monkey kidney epithelial cells, were cultured under standard conditions. DNA encoding the chimeric ts-045-G:GFP protein, ts-G-GFP <sub>ct </sub> , was microinjected into the cells’ nuclei. Microinjected cells were incubated at 39.5°C for 8–12 h prior to visualization and analysis. Injected cells were also incubated at 4, 15, 20 and 31°C, depending upon the experiment. In some experiments the drug cycloheximide was added to the cell cultures. Cycloheximide reversibly inhibits protein synthesis.\n\n【18】### Antibodies and immunofluorescence\n\n【19】Antibodies used in this study include the anti-COPI antibody ß’-COP, the anti-COPII antibody Sec13p, the RER-specific antibody calnexin, the intermediate compartment antibody ERGIC-53, and the trans Golgi network-specific antibody galT, which recognizes galactosyltransferase. A tubulin-specific antibody was also used. Fluorescent secondary antibodies were used as appropriate. Fluorescent images were captured using an inverted fluorescence microscope. Images were quantified using image analysis software that made it possible to count the number of ts-G-GFP <sub>ct </sub> fluorescent structures. In vivo analysis of vesicle movement was achieved by capturing images for 0.2 s every 3–5 s. The temperature of the stage of the microscope was controlled.\n\n【20】▪ Outline the steps that must occur between injection of the chimeric ts-045-G:GFP DNA and accumulation of ts-G-GFP <sub>ct </sub> in the RER of the cell.\n\n【21】▪ Debate whether results generated from an immortalized monkey kidney cell line can be applied to all eukaryotic cells.\n\n【22】Results\n-------\n\n【23】▪ Study the images in Figure 8.1.1 b, d, and f. Use these data to describe (in writing or drawing) the relationship between the major endomembrane compartments involved in exocytosis.\n\n【24】▪ Develop an argument for or against the following statement based on the data in Figure 8.1.1 , “ts-G-GFP <sub>ct </sub> is a valid tool for studying transport of ts-045-G in vivo .”\n\n【25】▪ Study the images of ts-G-GFP <sub>ct </sub> , COPI, and COPII distributions in the cell 6 min after the shift to 31°C in Figure 8.1.2 a–c. Summarize your observations.\n\n【26】▪ Estimate the size of the coated vesicles that are carrying ts-G-GFP <sub>ct </sub> .\n\n【27】▪ Confirm the labeling of ts-G-GFP <sub>ct </sub> structures described in the figure legend for Figure 8.1.2 . Look for examples of colocalization (or the absence of colocalization) not labeled in the images shown in Figure 8.1.2 a’–c’ here. What conclusion is supported by these data?\n\n【28】▪ Explain why colocalization between ts-G-GFP <sub>ct </sub> and the COPS was only analyzed in the “flat peripheral region of the cell.” What effect might limiting counting of vesicles to that area have on the data?\n\n【29】▪ What was the purpose of including cycloheximide in the experiment shown in Figure 8.1.2 ? Predict what the consequence of omitting cycloheximide might have been.\n\n【30】▪ Describe the relationship between the data in Figure 8.1.3 a and Figure 8.1.2 .\n\n【31】▪ In the area graph in Figure 8.1.3 a the number of each type of COP-coated vesicle containing ts-G-GFP <sub>ct </sub> at any time point can be calculated by subtracting the lower from the upper edge of each region. The total number of ts-G-GFP <sub>ct </sub> vesicles is the sum of all regions at each time point. Using this information calculate the following:\n\n【32】▪ Number of COPI only vesicles at 6 min\n\n【33】▪ Number of COPII only vesicles at 10 min\n\n【34】▪ Total number of vesicles at 2 and 10 min\n\n【35】▪ Number of COP-negative vesicles at 10 min\n\n【36】▪ Number of COPI + II vesicles at 4 min\n\n【37】▪ Propose an explanation for the change in ts-G-GFP <sub>ct </sub> positive structures over time.\n\n【38】▪ Discuss the significance of the error bars in Figure 8.1.3 a.\n\n【39】▪ Summarize the conclusion supported by the data shown in Figure 8.1.3 b.\n\n【40】▪ Compare the data in Figure 8.1.3 c with that in Figure 8.1.3 b.

He was unresponsive for approximately 30 seconds then slowly regained awareness over the following 2 minutes. He reported no neck pain but did complain of a moderate generalized headache as well as nausea and tinnitus. When tested on the sideline 5 minutes after his injury, he was oriented only to the place and the name of his coach, did not know the month, day, or year, could not recall who was president, and had no memory of the series of plays immediately prior to becoming unconscious. His speech was quite slow and deliberate. His pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light, and he had no facial asymmetry. Finger-to-nose testing was somewhat slow and deliberate with mild past-pointing. His gait was mildly wide-based and unsteady. When tested again 15 minutes after his injury, he was oriented to person, place, and time, but still had no memory of the events preceding his injury, and his gait remained unsteady. He was taken to a local emergency center for further evaluation. Regarding the remainder of his history, he is a neurodevelopmentally normal young man who had never previously experienced loss of consciousness. He had no other medical problems and was not taking any medications. He had not recently been ill. There was no history of neurologic problems in the family.\n\n【3】 What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【4】 What is the next diagnostic step?\n\n【5】 What is the next step in therapy?\n\n【6】### ANSWERS TO CASE 10: Cerebral Concussion\n\n【7】_Summary_ : This is a case of a previously healthy and neurodevelopmentally normal 15-year-old boy, who experienced a brief loss of consciousness during a football game with mild but persistent neurologic symptoms more than 15 minutes after the initial injury. He is now in the emergency department for evaluation.\n\n【8】• Most likely diagnosis : Concussion.\n\n【9】• Next diagnostic step : CT scan without contrast.\n\n【10】• Next step in therapy : Observation, reassurance, and education.\n\n【11】#### ANALYSIS\n\n【12】##### _Objectives_\n\n【13】1\\. Be aware of the basic epidemiology of concussion.\n\n【14】2\\. Understand clinical criteria for obtaining head imaging following a concussion.\n\n【15】3\\. Know current “return-to-play” guidelines for sports-related concussions.\n\n【16】4\\. Be aware of the clinical features and usual course of the postconcussion syndrome.\n\n【17】##### _Considerations_\n\n【18】The neurologic status of this 15-year-old boy is now steadily improving following his sports-related concussion. There are no focal or lateralizing findings on his neurologic examination to suggest a significant central nervous system injury. Nevertheless, given his persistent retrograde amnesia (his inability to remember the events preceding his injury), it would be prudent to obtain a noncontrast head CT looking for hemorrhage or other significant abnormality. He can then be observed in the ER until he returns entirely to his neurologic baseline, or he could be admitted to the hospital for overnight observation. It will be important to inform the family of postconcussive symptoms they should expect as well as any symptoms that should prompt seeking medical attention.\n\n【19】### APPROACH TO: Cerebral Concussion\n\n【20】#### EPIDEMIOLOGY\n\n【21】Although there is no universally accepted definition of concussion, the term is generally taken to refer to a traumatic alteration in cognitive function with or without loss of consciousness. As such, concussion is best thought of as a mild traumatic brain injury (TBI). It is a very common occurrence, with an incidence of approximately 50 people per 100,000 in the United States. More than 300,000 sports-related traumatic brain injuries occur every year. It was estimated in a recent review that up to 3.8 million recreation- and sport-related concussions occur annually in the United States. The large variance is attributable to original estimates including concussions that only involved loss of consciousness (LOC). This highlights the difficulty with concussion epidemiology because of underreporting and the lack of widespread use of an injury surveillance system in youth sports. With increasing access to recreational and organized (club and school) sports, as well as better awareness and recognition of the injury, the number of diagnosed concussions will likely increase. Because of the large numbers of participants in youth and high school sports, concussions in the pediatric and adolescent age groups account for the majority of sports-related concussions.\n\n【22】Concussions represent an estimated 8.9% of all high school athletic injuries. Data are significantly lacking about concussions in grade school and middle school athletes, which highlights the need for more research about concussions in this younger age group.\n\n【23】The sport with highest risk of concussion in high school is football . In girls’ sports, the rate of concussion is highest in girls’ soccer and girls’ basketball. Rugby, ice hockey, and lacrosse also account for higher rates of concussions but are often club sports, which limits their data inclusion in the larger high school sports epidemiologic studies.\n\n【24】Table 10–1 • CONCUSSION RATES IN HIGH SCHOOL SPORTS\n\n【25】#### PATHOPHYSIOLOGY\n\n【26】Since the ascending reticular-activating system (ARAS) is a key structure mediating wakefulness, transient interruption of its function can be partly responsible for temporary loss of consciousness following head injury. The junction between the thalamus and the midbrain, which contains reticular neurons of the ARAS, seems to be particularly susceptible to the forces produced by rapid deceleration of the head as it strikes a fixed object. The pathophysiology of other symptoms, such as anterograde and retrograde memory difficulties, is less clear. Certainly more severe traumatic brain injuries can be associated with diffuse axonal injury as well as cortical contusions leading to dysfunction.\n\n【27】#### CLASSIFICATION OF CONCUSSION\n\n【28】There are several different schemes available to classify concussions, but the one most commonly used is that developed by the American Academy of Neurology. According to this system:\n\n【29】• A grade 1 concussion involves no loss of consciousness and all symptoms resolve within 15 minutes.\n\n【30】• A grade 2 concussion involves no loss of consciousness but symptoms last longer than 15 minutes.\n\n【31】• A grade 3 concussion involves loss of consciousness for any period of time.\n\n【32】Such a grading system is useful in considerations about management as well as in considering possible return to play for sports-related concussions. It should be noted that this scheme is currently undergoing revision.\n\n【33】#### INITIAL MANAGEMENT OF CONCUSSION\n\n【34】In any patient with a head injury, immediate thought must be given to whether or not there is a concomitant cervical spine injury . If any suspicion exists then the spine must be immobilized, and the patient transported to an ER for evaluation. If a spinal injury is suspected, taking off the football helmet should only be performed by a healthcare provider experienced in its removal. Apart from the spine, the possibility of intracranial hemorrhage is the principal concern in the setting of a concussive injury. This is relatively uncommon, complicating only 10% of such injuries, but must be considered as its presence will change subsequent management. A noncontrast head CT is sufficiently sensitive to detect clinically significant bleeding. An MRI scan is not necessary.\n\n【35】An important clinical question is to determine which patients require imaging and which do not. Clearly, any patient with focal neurologic findings, persistent mental status changes, or worsening neurologic status requires imaging. Conversely, patients who experience only very brief transient confusion without any subsequent symptoms (a grade 1 concussion) are very unlikely to have any significant intracranial pathology. The _New Orleans Criteria_ recommends a head CT if any of the following are true: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> persistent headache, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> emesis, 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> age: older than 60 years, 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> drug or alcohol intoxication, 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> persistent anterograde amnesia, 通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u> evidence of soft-tissue or bony injury above the clavicles, or 通用删除7(英):<u>(7)</u> a seizure. Imaging is often recommended for children younger than 16 years of age because clear validated clinical criteria do not yet exist.\n\n【36】The next issue will be for how long and in what context to observe the patient. Clearly, individuals with hemorrhage or other acute abnormalities on imaging will require hospitalization and careful monitoring. Relatively small surface contusions are not uncommon and are very unlikely to portend any significant neurologic problem other than headache. Such patients should be observed overnight in the hospital but can be discharged the next day if their neurologic examination is normal. Patients with normal head CTs and normal neurologic examinations who sustained a grade 1 or grade 2 concussion can safely be discharged home from the ER after 2 hours of observation. The practice of discharging patients with the instruction to wake them up at intervals to make sure that they can be aroused is not recommended. If such monitoring is necessary, it would be better performed in a hospital setting.\n\n【37】Prior to discharge, it is important to clarify with the patient and the family what symptoms are to be expected and what symptoms should prompt a phone call or return visit. The postconcussive syndrome, discussed below, is quite common and symptoms such as headache, dizziness, irritability, and difficulty concentrating are to be expected. However, worsening cognitive function, new sensory or motor symptoms, increasing drowsiness, or significant emesis should prompt a return for further evaluation.\n\n【38】#### POSTCONCUSSION SYNDROME\n\n【39】Following a concussion, up to 90% of patients will continue to experience headaches and dizziness for at least 1 month. Between 30% and 80% of patients develop a more extensive constellation of symptoms within 4 weeks of their head injury referred to as postconcussion syndrome (PCS). These individuals report other symptoms such as irritability, depression, insomnia, and subjective intellectual dysfunction. Fatigue, anxiety, and excessive noise sensitivity can also be seen. Some patients report becoming unusually sensitive to the effects of alcohol. Many patients who develop PCS also become preoccupied with fears of brain damage. PCS appears to be more likely to develop in non-sports-related concussions such as those following MVAs or falls. The peak of symptom intensity is generally 1 week after injury, and most patients are symptom-free by 3 months. However, approximately 25% of patients will still be symptomatic after 6 months, and 10% report symptoms 1 year following injury. In patients with such unrelenting symptoms, it remains unclear and somewhat controversial what is caused by psychogenic factors and what is caused by residual pathophysiologic effects of the initial TBI. Psychiatric consultation would most certainly be warranted in patients with persistent PCS. More detailed neuro-imaging using an MRI should also be considered in these patients to fully exclude significant parenchymal injury. Educating patients at the time of their initial injury regarding common symptoms and the benign self-limited nature of PCS is likely to be helpful.\n\n【40】#### RETURN-TO-PLAY GUIDELINES\n\n【41】For sports-related concussions, an important consideration is when the athlete will be able to return to playing. Determining when an athlete returns to play after a concussion should follow an individualized course, because each athlete will recover at a different pace. Under no circumstances should pediatric or adolescent athletes with concussion return to play the same day of their concussion. No athlete should return to play while still symptomatic at rest or with exertion. Although the vast majority of athletes with concussion will become asymptomatic within a week of their concussion, numerous studies have demonstrated a longer recovery of full cognitive function in younger athletes compared with college-aged or professional athletes—often 7 to 10 days or longer. Due to this longer cognitive recovery period, although they are asymptomatic, there should be a more conservative approach to deciding when pediatric and adolescent athletes can return to play. A matter of ongoing debate is the issue of when an athlete should retire (whether in high school or playing at a professional level) from a sport in which they have sustained multiple concussions. These recommendations apply to athletes experiencing their first concussion of the season. For a second concussion, even more conservative management should be employed. Studies show that recurrent concussions are associated with prolonged recovery time and more severe symptoms with loss of consciousness than those with first time concussion injury. Postconcussion-rehabilitative approach should be employed for all concussion cases. The program should be characterized by a stepwise incorporation of activity between 1- and 5-day increments based on the individual’s injury and rate of recovery . Athletes should contact their physician if symptoms recur. Any athlete with recurrent concussions or prolonged symptoms may require a longer concussion-rehabilitation program, which is ideally created by a physician who is experienced in concussion management.\n\n【42】Table 10–2 • CONCUSSION-REHABILITATION/STEPWISE RETURN TO PLAY\n\n【43】####", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Temperatures above 40℃ are life threatening， and brain death begins at 41℃. Common signs include confusion， headache， muscle cramps， and nausea. Severe confusion may lead patients to become hostile and act as if intoxicated. High body temperatures will cause excessive perspiration until dehydration occurs. Acute dehydration causes blood pressure to drop significantly， possibly leading to dizziness or even fainting， especially when standing suddenly. To counter the drop in blood pressure， increased heart rate (tachycardia) and respiration rate (tachypnea) occur to increase the oxygen supply to the body. Cutaneous blood vessels dilate to increase heat dissipation， resulting in a red skin color. As heat stroke progresses， blood vessels constrict to help increase blood pressure， then causing a paler， bluish skin color. Eventually， body organs begin to fail until unconsciousness and coma result. Demographically， studies have shown that women and the elderly are at greater risk for heat stroke. Proper treatment of heat stroke includes immediate hospitalization. The patient’s body temperature must be lowered quickly. Methods include moving patient to cool areas with fans or air conditioning， removing patient's clothes， and submerging the patient in cold water bath. Additionally， rehydration is critical and is achieved by drinking large amounts of water and isotonic beverages (eg， Gatorade).\n\n【13】**APPROACH TO：**\n\n【14】**Thermoregulation**\n\n【15】**OBJECTIVES**\n\n【16】1\\. Know the ways and means to prevent hypothermia.\n\n【17】2\\. Know the temperature-increasing and temperature-decreasing mechanisms.\n\n【18】**DEFINITIONS**\n\n【19】HOMEOTHERM： An organism， such as a mammal or bird， having a body temperature that is constant and largely independent of the temperature of its surroundings； an endotherm；“warm-blooded.”\n\n【20】POIKILOTHERM： An organism， such as a fish or reptile， having a body temperature that varies with the temperature of its surroundings； an ectotherm； “cold-blooded.”\n\n【21】PREOPTIC AREA： A region of the brain that is situated immediately below the anterior commissure， above the optic chiasma， on the anterior side of the hypo-thalamus that regulates certain autonomic activities often with other portions of the hypothalamus.\n\n【22】THERMORECEPTOR： A sensory receptor that responds to heat and cold.\n\n【23】PILOERECTION： Involuntary erection or bristling of hairs owing to a sympathet-ic reflex usually triggered by cold， shock， or fright， or caused by a sympathomimetic agent.\n\n【24】THYROXINE (T4)： An iodine-containing hormone (C，H I NO)， produced by the thyroid gland， that increases the rate of cell metabolism and regulates growth.\n\n【25】Thermoregulation is the ability of an organism to maintain its body temperature within certain boundaries， even when the environmental temperature is different. Like all mammals， humans are homeothermic， or “warm-blooded.”Human core temperature is about 37℃. Many nonmammals， such as reptiles and fish， are poikilotherms， or“cold-blooded”organisms.\n\n【26】Thermoregulation is controlled p Or1i1marily by nervous feedback mechanismsoperating through the hypothalamus. The thermostatic center is found in the anterior portion of the hypothalamus in the preoptic area. This area has a large number of heat-sensitive neurons (warm receptors) and about a third as many cold-sensitive neurons (cold receptors).\n\n【27】There are two general types of thermoreceptors： warm receptors and cold recep-tors. The axons of warm receptors are unmyelinated， slow-conducting C fibers， while the axons of cold receptors are lightly myelinated， faster-conducting Ad fibers. The receptive fields of thermoreceptors are small spots with diameters of approxi-mately 1 mm in glabrous skin and 3-5 mm in hairy skin. About three to four spots are innervated by a single axon. At normal body temperature， both warm and cold spots discharge， but as temperatures increase， cold spots reduce their firing frequency while warm spots increase their firing. Activation of warm-sensitive receptors (at temperatures above 37℃) results in activation of neurons in the paraventricular nucleus and lateral hypothalamus to increase parasympathetic outflow and increase heat dissipation. Warm-sensitive receptors have inhibitory connections to cold-sensitive neurons. Increased discharge in cold-sensitive neurons results in activa-tion of neurons in the paraventricular nucleus and the posterior hypothalamus to increase sympathetic outflow in order to generate and conserve heat. Cold-sensitive\n\n【28】neurons do not have intrinsic temperature receptors but instead increase their dis-charge by the decrease in the discharge rate of warm-sensitive neurons.\n\n【29】Unlike the preoptic area， the skin has far more cold receptors than warm receptors. This signifies that peripheral temperature detection is mainly concerned with distinguishing cool and cold rather than detecting warm temperatures， probably in order to prevent hypothermia.\n\n【30】The temperature sensory signals from the peripheral thermoreceptors in the skin and mucous membranes and those from the internal central thermoreceptors in the hypothalamic preoptic area are transmitted bilaterally to a specific area in the posterior hypothalamus at the level of the mamillary bodies. Here， the signals are combined to control the heat-conserving and heat-producing mechanisms of the body.\n\n【31】The hypothalamus works together with higher cortical centers to keep core body temperature constant. Responses range from involuntary (mediated by the autonomic nervous system and neurohormones) to semivoluntary and voluntary behavioral responses.\n\n【32】_Responses to Cold： Temperature-Increasing Mechanisms_\n\n【33】Cold environments cool blood flowing into the skin and stimulate the skin's cold receptors. When blood temperature drops below normal， the neurons stimulate regions in the caudal hypothalamus responsible for mechanisms of heat conserva-tion， initiating a variety of responses to promote heat gain and inhibit heat loss. Involuntary responses， which involve activation of the sympathetic nervous system， include the following：\n\n【34】1.Vasoconstriction. Release of norepinephrine from the sympathetic fibers constricts cutaneous blood vessels， thereby reducing blood flow and heat loss to the cold air.\n\n【35】2\\. Piloerection. Contraction of the arrectores pilorum (stimulated by a， adrenore-ceptors) causes piloerection trapping warm air close to the skin.\n\n【36】3\\. Increased heat production. Sympathetic excitation and shivering allow for increased thermogenesis. Cellular metabolism can be increased via sympathetic stimulation， or by the actions of circulating epinephrine and norepinephrine in the blood. This is called chemical thermogenesis. Epinephrine and norepineph-rine have the ability to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation， allowing excess foodstuffs to be oxidized， releasing heat energy. The amount of brown fat， a type of fat that contains large numbers of special mitochondria where uncoupled oxidation occurs， is proportional to the amount of chemical thermogenesis in an organism. Infants， who have small amounts of brown fat， are able to use this process to double heat production. However， adults， who have almost no brown fat， are only able to increase heat production by 10%-15% via this process.\n\n【37】Another form of chemical thermogenesis involves increased cellular metabolism caused by thyroxine. Cooling the hypothalamic preoptic area causes an increase in production and secretion of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) by the hypo-thalamus. TRH travels through the portal veins to the anterior pituitary， where it\n\n【38】stimulates secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). TSH then stimulates the thyroid to release thyroxine (T4)， which increases the body’s metabolic rate.\n\n【39】Shivering is controlled by the primary motor center for shivering， found in the dorsomedial posterior hypothalamus. This center is usually excited by cold signals from the skin and spinal cord and inhibited by warm signals from the hypothalamic preoptic area. When body temperatures fall too low， the motor center will transmit signals through bilateral tracts down the brain stem and the lateral columns of the spi-nt11nal cord， and eventually to the anterior motor neurons， stimulating an increase in the tone of skeletal muscles around the body. Shivering begins when muscle tone reaches a critical level and can increase heat production up to four or five times that of normal.\n\n【40】More voluntary responses include increased physical activity， such as pacing and hand rubbing， and behavioral changes， such as wearing extra clothing and huddling in groups. These voluntary behaviors are activated mainly by the cerebral cortex and limbic system.\n\n【41】_Responses to Heat： Temperature-Decreasing Mechanisms_\n\n【42】Body temperature rises when the body is exposed to excess heat. The skin’s warm receptors and higher blood temperature signal the hypothalamus to inhibit adrener-gic activity of the sympathetic nervous system， leading to metabolic rate reduction and cutaneous vasodilation. Responses to heat include the following：\n\n【43】1\\. Vasodilation. Inhibition of the sympathetic centers in the posterior hypothalamus causes cutaneous vasodilation， allowing for increased blood flow and greater heat oss via the skin.\n\n【44】2\\. Sweating. In particularly warm conditions， the hypothalamus signals the cholinergic sympathetic fibers to release acetylcholine in order to stimulate the muscarinic cholinergic receptors on the eccrine sweat glands to induce sweat. Eccrine sweat glands are found all around the body but are most prevalent on the palms， soles， and forehead. Heat is then lost via the evaporation of sweat from the skin at a rate of about 0.58 kcal/mL.\n\n【45】3\\. Decrease in heat production. All mechanisms involved in heat production and conservation are severely inhibited.\n\n【46】Voluntary behavioral responses to heat， such as resting， wearing less clothing， fanning， and drinking cold fluids， help with heat loss as well.\n\n【47】Fever is a medical condition that describes a temporary increase in the body's thermoregulatory set point (usually by about 1℃-2℃). Fever differs from hyperther-mia in that during a fever， the body’s thermoregulatory set point itself is elevated， whereas in hyperthermia， body temperature rises above the set point. The increase in thermoregulatory set point in the hypothalamus during a fever can be attributed to the activity of the cytokines IL-1， IL-6， and TNF-a. It is important to note that fever is not a medical condition itself， but rather a symptom of other pathology.\n\n【48】**CASE CORRELATES**\n\n| CASE CORRELATES · See Cases 28-36 (regulatory systems).  |\n| --- |", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Hirschsprung disease is characterized by a lack of Auerbach and Meissner plexuses, both of which are components of the nerve plexus in the large intestine. These plexuses are composed of cells that have migrated from the neural crest. Auerbach plexus is found between the outer circular and longitudinal muscle layers that are responsible for motility. Meissner plexus is in the submucosal layer. Failure of these plexuses to develop leads to the characteristic megacolon (colonic dilation) seen on this radiograph.  \n\n【8】Answer B is incorrect . Failure of neural tube closure during embryogenesis leads to neural tube defects such as anencephaly and spina bifida, both of which would be obvious at birth. Folic acid supplementation by women prior to conception decreases the fetus’ risk of developing neural tube defects, although folic acid’s mechanism of action is unknown.  \n\n【9】Answer C is incorrect . Herniation of mucosal and submucosal tissue at the cricopharyngeus muscle (junction of the pharynx and esophagus) describes Zenker diverticulum. This is a false diverticulum (does not involve the muscular layers) with presenting symptoms of halitosis (malodorous breath), dysphagia, and re-gurgitation of undigested food.  \n\n【10】Answer D is incorrect . A remnant portion of the vitelline duct is describing Meckel diverticulum. It commonly is located in the antimesenteric border of the ileum, usually within 60 cm of the ileocecal valve. Meckel diverticulum can be remembered with the “rule of 2s”: 2 inches long; 2 feet from the ileocecal valve; 2% of the population get it; commonly presents in the first 2 years of life; and may have 2 types of epithelium (gastric and/or pancreatic). Ectopic acid-secreting gastric mucosa found in Meckel diverticulum can cause ulcers, which may bleed and result in bloody stool.  \n\n【11】Answer E is incorrect . Volvulus occurs when a portion of the bowel rotates around its mesentery, leading to bowel obstruction, ischemia, and possible perforation with resultant peritonitis. Whereas midgut volvulus can occur in infants with congenital intestinal malrotation and in the cecum in young adults, volvulus is most common in redundant segments of the colon such as the sigmoid in elderly, debilitated patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

He states that the rash began on his chest and abdomen and spread to his arms, legs, as well as his palms and soles. The rash is completely asymptomatic. He denies any recent illnesses or sick contacts, but he recalls an episode of a penile ulcer approximately 2 months ago, which resolved without any intervention. On examination, there is a generalized light pink papular rash on the back, chest and abdomen ( 63a ). On the hands, there are red-brown macules scattered on the palmar aspects of the hands and fingers ( 63b ).\n\n【4】i. What is the diagnosis and causative pathogen? What tests can be performed to confirm the diagnosis?\n\n【5】ii. What is the time course of the different stages of this infection? What are the cutaneous findings associated with each stage?\n\n【6】iii. What complication can be observed with treatment?\n\n【7】Answer 63\n\n【8】i. The patient presents with a history and clinical findings consistent with secondary syphilis, a sexually transmitted infection caused by the spirochete, _Treponema pallidum._ Serological tests can be performed to help confirm the diagnosis. The non-treponemal tests include Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) and rapid plasma reagin (RPR), which become reactive 4–5 weeks after infection and revert to non-reactive states during latent stages of the disease and after treatment. Although these tests demonstrate high sensitivity, conditions such as pregnancy, other spirochete infections, certain viral infections (human immunodeficiency virus \\[HIV\\], infectious mononucleosis) and autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus can lead to falsely positive non-treponemal tests. Treponemal tests include fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) and microhemagglutination assay for _T. pallidum_ (MHA-TP). FTA-ABS is positive by 3 weeks after infection and remains positive after treatment, whereas MHA-TP is less sensitive during primary syphilis. ELISA demonstrates 100% specificity and is useful during early or congenital infection, but is less sensitive in later stages of disease. Dark-field microscopy can also be performed to confirm the diagnosis, however, it is not widely available.\n\n【9】ii. After inoculation, the primary stage of syphilis occurs after an incubation period of 10–90 days (average 3 weeks). The secondary stage of syphilis occurs 3–10 weeks after the appearance of primary syphilis in almost all untreated patients. It represents the hematogenous and lymphatic dissemination of treponemes in different tissues and thus demonstrates a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. Following secondary syphilis, a period of latency can occur and last for many years. Approximately 70% of patients enter a period of latency and remain immune to new primary infections. Latent syphilis is divided into early and late latency periods. The remainder of individuals may progress to the tertiary stage or late stage of syphilis, in which the microorganism invades the central nervous and cardiovascular systems.\n\n【10】Clinically, primary syphilis manifests as a firm, well-circumscribed, painless chancre arising on mucosal surfaces such as the mouth, genitals or anus, with or without associated lymphadenopathy. These may go unnoticed when they occur inside the vagina or anus. In the secondary stage, prodromal symptoms such as low-grade fever, malaise, conjunctivitis, pharyngitis, adenopathy and weight loss are frequently reported. In the skin, secondary syphilis presents as a generalized non-pruritic eruption that can range in colour from pink to red-brown. It usually occurs on the trunk and affects the palms and soles. Infiltrations of treponemes manifest as condylomata lata in the anogenital region and as corona veneris along the hairline. On the mucous membranes, mucous patches and syphilitic perleche can be observed. Less commonly, secondary syphilis can manifest as patchy alopecia with a characteristic ‘moth-eaten’ appearance. Tertiary syphilis is characterized by the development of gummas or locally destructive lesions in the organs. In the skin, gummas present as nodular or noduloulcerative lesions that involute over weeks to months with residual scarring. Tertiary syphilis can also affect the central nervous system (CNS) and cardiovascular system, leading to neurosyphilis and aortitis, respectively.\n\n【11】iii. The treatment of choice for all stages of syphilis is penicillin G. A Jarisch–Herxheimer reaction can be observed upon treatment of early syphilis, which is caused by the release of inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) due to phagocytosis of the spirochetes after antibiotic administration. It is characterized by fever, headache, lymphadenopathy, myalgias and leukocytosis. It can be managed with supportive care and should not lead to cessation of treatment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Alopecia is a potential side effect that warrants substantial consideration, with many patients claiming this as the most distressing aspect of their procedure, and some even stating they would forgo curative treatment due to potential alopecia. Hair loss is typically localized to the area of treatment and occurs in a dose-dependent fashion a few weeks after exposure to radiation. In addition to the cumulative dose of radiation that a patient receives, severity of hair loss may also be increased by the method of radiation delivery, patient-related factors such as smoking, and the use of certain antineoplastic agents. Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation and a history of radiation exposure, with dermoscopy findings for lower doses being similar to that of alopecia areata. Although most cases will spontaneously resolve within 6 months, prevention and treatment options do exist for refractory cases of alopecia. Newer treatment delivery methods that reduce off-target radiation, preventative therapies, topical medications, injections, surgery, and transplantation have all been used with some success. Of note, scalp cooling has not been shown to be an effective prevention strategy in alopecia due to radiation.\n\n【14】Keywords\n\n【15】Radiation Radiotherapy Alopecia Scalp cooling Minoxidil\n\n【16】A 60-year-old female reported hair loss after her scalp was treated for reactive lymphoid hyperplasia about 5 years ago. She stated that after her treatment ended, she had a rash on the scalp for about 3 weeks that then resolved. The area healed with pigmentation changes and her hair did not grow back. Her eyelashes were not affected by treatment but she has new lesions in her eyebrows of about 6 months duration.\n\n【17】On physical examination, there is complete hair loss of the central and frontal scalp. There are areas of hypopigmentation and hyperpigmentation mixed with pink and white macules and plaques. Of note, there are indurated, pink plaques of the eyebrows, consistent with new areas of reactive lymphoid hyperplasia. The eyelashes are intact . The fingernails were normal in appearance.\n\n【18】A photograph of a person's bald head. The front of the scalp has white spots with no hair.

Patients also receive radiation as part of fluoroscopic procedures, such as cerebral angiography, which can have similar adverse event profiles 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Although alopecia occurs less frequently after radiation exposure than after chemotherapy, its effect on a patient’s quality of life can be profound 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. In one study, almost 20% of respondents said that alopecia was the most distressing side effect of their radiation treatment, and over 10% stated they would reject curative radiation treatment if it was associated with alopecia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【34】Alopecia after radiation follows a dose-response pattern and typically begins after cumulative exposures of 2 gray (Gy) or more 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Initially, the hair loss is that of anagen effluvium, in which damage to actively dividing matrix cells in the anagen follicles causes shedding of dystrophic hairs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. At lower doses, hair loss is expected to begin 1–3 weeks after exposure and spontaneously resolve within 2–6 months. However, severe, cicatricial alopecia can result from higher dose-exposures, with a 50% probability of toxicity found to be around 43 Gy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. This dose may be lower in pediatric patients, with a small study showing permanent radiation-induced alopecia resulting from doses as low as 21–30 Gy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【35】The mechanism of this damage is complex, involving an inflammatory cascade triggered by irradiated skin and endothelial cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. In addition to the total exposure and type of radiotherapy used (proton versus photon), the severity of hair loss can be increased by other patient-related factors such as smoking, poor nutrition, autoimmune conditions, and the use of certain antineoplastic agents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Ultimately, this can result in permanent damage to epithelial stem cells in the bulge region and fibrosis of the affected area 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【36】Diagnosis of alopecia due to radiation is typically based on clinical presentation (well-demarcated areas of alopecia localized to the areas of radiation treatment, typically without inflammation) and a history of exposure to radiation in the past month 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Dermoscopic findings at lower radiation doses are similar to those of alopecia areata, with yellow and black dots, short vellus hairs, broken hair, coiled hair, and white dots being common 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. At higher doses associated with cicatricial alopecia, dermoscopy will show decreased hair density, white patches, and the absence of follicular openings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【37】Treatment\n---------\n\n【38】As alopecia can be such a concerning side effect of treatment, it is important to counsel patients on the potential timing of their hair loss and that most cases will spontaneously resolve. Additionally, management strategies do exist for radiotherapy alopecia. Some of these include preventative therapies, topical medications, injections, and surgery. The way the radiation treatment itself is delivered can also have an impact. To reduce off-target radiation and spare healthy hair, newer treatment planning strategies such as intensity modulated radiotherapy and volumetric-arc therapy (both of which employ linear accelerators and precision treatment planning to treat tumors while minimizing exposure of the scalp) can be employed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Scalp cooling, which may have utility in some other conditions, has not been shown to be preventative for alopecia due to radiation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【39】Preventative therapies such as nitroxides or prostaglandin E2 prior to radiotherapy have been shown to be possibly preventative for alopecia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Topical silymarin (an extract from milk thistle), subcutaneous amifostine, and oral pentoxifylline are other agents that have been studied for prevention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. All of these medications have antioxidant properties and are theorized to improve blood flow and inhibit fibroblast proliferation at the area of treatment. Cholecalciferol (vitamin D <sub>3 </sub> ), which has some evidence for potentially regulating gene transcription and increasing the expression of keratins, appears to be preventative in some studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Less proven preventative therapies include the application of topical epinephrine or norepinephrine, which conferred up to 95% coat retention in a study of rats exposed to radiation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>.\n\n【40】Topical minoxidil 5% solution has been used for the treatment of persistent alopecia with moderate success. One study reported an 82% subjective response rate among patients with radiation-induced alopecia lasting longer than 6 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Minoxidil is thought to cause local vasodilation via ATP-dependent potassium channel activation, and stimulation of resting hair follicles into the anagen phase. A good response is typically achieved in 4 months with twice daily use but may take over a year if exposed to higher doses of radiation.\n\n【41】N-acetylcysteine, available in both topical and oral forms, is another potential therapy. Through its anti-inflammatory effects on IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1, it is thought to reduce the cascade of cytokines that results from damaging radiation on epithelial cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. By donating a cysteine and replenishing glutathione, n-acetylcysteine also exerts antioxidant effects. This reduces reactive oxygen species that could potentially damage cellular organelles.\n\n【42】Botulinum toxin type A injection has mixed evidence, with some case reports supporting its use to treat radiotherapy alopecia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. The theorized mechanism of this improvement was an increased blood flow to the tissues of the scalp, via relaxation of the musculature. One such report injected muscles around the scalp (including frontalis, temporalis, periauricular, and occipitalis muscles) at 30 injection sites every 3 months for 12 months. There was minimal effect noted at 3 months, with more modest increases in hair density and thickness noted after 12 months.\n\n【43】For cases of alopecia refractory to treatment, reconstructive surgical options may be considered. In pediatric patients, a variety of techniques have been reported with good success 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. Choice of surgical technique should be guided by the pattern and location of hair loss, and include simple excision, scalp flap surgery, and tissue expansion. Transplantation can also be considered and has a success rate reported to be as high as 85% even in areas of poor vascularization. Some hair growth may be observed within 3 months after transplant, but full results are often not realized for over 1 year.\n\n【44】Key Points\n----------\n\n【45】*   Alopecia due to radiation exposure follows a dose-response relationship, with transient anagen effluvium expected at doses above 2 Gy, and potential for permanent hair loss at doses above 43 Gy.\n\n【46】*   Hair loss begins 1–3 weeks after radiation exposure and will resolve spontaneously in 2–6 months for low doses.\n\n【47】*   As alopecia can be such a concerning side effect of treatment, it is important to counsel patients on the expected timing for appearance and resolution of this potential event.\n\n【48】*   While no treatments have been found to be entirely effective, the use of preventative medications, topical agents, reconstructive surgery, and transplantation have all been tried with some success.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

He appears well with normal vital signs； his examination reveals decreased passive range of motion of the right hip.Best treatment for this problem： After excluding septic arthritis， osteomyelitis and other non-benign etiologies， treat for transient synovitis with NSAIDs and bed rest for 7 to 10 days.1\\. Recognize the clinical presentation of transient synovitis， and appreciate the simi-larities of its presentation to septic arthritis and other serious pathologies of limp.\n\n【7】2\\. Learn about the diagnosis and treatment of suspected septic arthritis.\n\n【8】3\\. Be familiar with the other etiologies of limp in a child.Transient synovitis is the most common cause of acute hip pain in children aged 3 to10 years old. The arthralgia is caused by a temporary inflammation of the synovium， the soft tissue that lines the non-cartilaginous surfaces of the hip joint. While the etiology is not clearly understood， the disease is suspected to be secondary to an infection as up to 50% of patients report a recent upper respiratory tract infection. Fever typically is absent but may occur. Most patients will complain of unilateral hip pain， and up to 5% will have bilateral pain. There is a male-to-female predominance of slightly more than 2：1.\n\n【9】While this case is a typical example of transient synovitis， the diagnosis not to miss is septic arthritis， an infection that can lead to rapid destruction of the articular joint cartilage. This disease can lead to long-term morbidity if not diagnosed early， and joints of the lower extremity are affected in more than 90% of the cases.Approximately 3% o AFf children who present to the emergency department for limp will have septic arthritis. Causative bacterial organisms vary with age group， but Staphylococcus aureus is the most common organism， followed by Group A Streptococcus (S pyogenes) and S pneumoniae. Kingella kingae has recently become a common pathogen in children younger than 3， and Neisseria gonorhoeae should be considered in neonates and sexually active adolescents. Empiric antibiotic cover-age should include an antistaphylococcal agent with gram-negative coverage added when age appropriate.

In a series of 95 children with septic arthritis， most had a low-grade fever， but one-third were afebrile at presentation. Absence of fever should not sway the clinician from the diagnosis.Synovial fluid analysis， which includes cell count， Gram stain， culture and sensi-tivity testing， may be required to distinguish between septic arthritis and transient synovitis. A synovial fluid white blood cell count of >50，000 cells/uL with a predom-inance (>90%) of polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes suggests septic arthritis. The Gram stain may rapidly identify the organism， and the culture and sensitivity results will allow the antibiotic regimen to be narrowed. Notably， synovial fluid has bacteriostatic effects， and organisms may not grow in the routine culture. The likeli-hood of identifying the organism can be improved by placing a synovial fluid sample in a blood culture medium. Finally， neonates and adolescents with a suspected septic arthritis should be tested for gonorrhea.A bone scan uses IV technetium 99m-labeled methylene diphosphate to identify areas of increased cellular activity and blood flow. This test can be useful to detect early Legg-Calve-Perthes disease， osteomyelitis， stress fractures， and osteoid osteo-mas. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be helpful in detecting osteomyelitis， early avascular necrosis， and bone malignancies. Computed tomography (CT) is rarely indicated for musculoskeletal complaints； however the test may be necessary when intra-abdominal entities， such as appendicitis， or pelvic etiologies are in the differential.\n\n【17】Ultrasound (US) is perhaps the most useful imaging study after plain films in the evaluation of the pediatric limp. Recent studies have demonstrated that the use of bedside ED ultrasound can reliably detect a joint effusion . In one series of 96 children who underwent hip US for possible septic arthritis， none of the 40 patients who had normal US findings were later discharged with the diagnosis of septic arthritis. Early detection of a joint effusion and ultrasound guid-ance of arthrocentesis can decrease the time to definitive diagnosis and treatment\n\n【18】Figure 33-1. Ultrasound demonstrating a left hip effusion. The right hip is normal. The echogenic linear focus which courses along the left femoral neck is felt to represent periosteal new bone. An effusion is diagnosed when the distance between the anterior surface of the femoral neck and the posterior surface of the iliopsoas muscle is greater than 5 mm， or there is a greater than 2 mm difference from the contralateral hip. FH， femoral head； ASFN， anterior surface femoral head； PSIM， posterior surface iliopsoas muscle.\n\n【19】of septic arthritis. Additionally， the detection of bilateral hip effusions raises the clinical suspicion for rheumatologic conditions and transient synovitis. One study showed that up to 25% of patients with transient synovitis have bilateral effusions.Septic Arthritis is most common in children <3 years old. The male-to-female ratio is 2：1. The hip is the most common site (80%) with the most common organ-ism being S aureus. Others： group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus， S pneumoniae， Haemophilus influenzea type B， Kingella kingae (after URI)， Salmonella (sickle cell _patients)， Pseudomonas aeruginosa， Neisseria meningitidis， N gonorrhoeae， gram-_ negative bacilli. Pain in the affected joint， fever， edema， swelling， inability to bear weight， anorexia， irritability， pseudoparalysis may be presenting symptoms. There are no published clinical decision rules but a recent study notes that infection is indicated by： 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> inability to bear weight， 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> fever， 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> ESR >40 mm/h， 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> WBC>12，000/mm. Though the incidence is low， when present， IV antibiotics and surgical irrigation and debridement must be implemented immediately as disability due to destruction of joint tissue may ensue.\n\n【20】Osteomyelitis of the femur or pelvis can present as hip pain. The proximal femur is the most common site of bone infection in children， and may also involve the joint given the intracapular location . On examination， there may be focal erythema， swelling， and warmth near the location of the metaphysis. Similar to septic arthritis， the presentation may be attenuated by the recent antibiotic use. Plain films may not show bony changes until 10 to 20 days after symptoms began. MRI is the ideal study with a sensitivity of 92% to 100%. The most common organ-isms are the same as those that cause septic arthritis， and patients with osteomyelitis require empiric antibiotic therapy and emergent orthopedic consultation for bone aspiration.\n\n【21】Figure 33-2. An example of osteomyelitis of the left proximal femur， ischia， and iliac bones with associated left hip septic arthritis. There is also extensive myositis surrounding the left hip. There is possible pus under pressure or necrotic changes may be present in the left proximal fem ur.\n\n【22】Legg-Calve-Perthes disease (vascular necrosis of the femoral head) develops when an insufficient blood supply to the femoral head leads to necrosis. It is com-monly found in boys aged 4 to 10 years， and its cause is unknown. The child usually presents with a limp and may complain of hip or knee pain. On physical exami-nation， the child will have decreased range of motion at the affected hip. X-rays may show fragmentation and then healing of the femoral head ， and a bone scan will show decreased blood perfusion to the femoral head. Ten to twenty percent of patients will have bilateral disease， and the aim of treatment is to keep the femoral head within the acetabulum to allow healing to occur. A brace， cast， or splint may be required to immobilize the hip’s position. Patients should be referred to an orthopedist for possible surgical management.\n\n【23】Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis (SCFE) remains one of the most common disorders affecting the hip in adolescence. SCFE is characterized by the posterior displacement of the capital femoral epiphysis from the femoral neck through the growth plate. It is most common in obese boys aged 11 to 15 years. Children who grow rapidly and who have hormonal imbalances such as hypothyroidism and acro-megaly are also at risk. In addition to a limp， patients will complain of hip and/or knee pain. On examination， patients will have impaired internal rotation and passive hip flexion may be associated with compensatory external rotation. Plain films of the hip or pelvis will often show displacement of the femoral head， com-monly described as \"fallen ice cream from the cone\". Approximately 30% to 60%\n\n【24】Figure 33-3. Avascular Necrosis of the Femoral HeadToddler's fracture is a nondisplaced fracture of the distal tibial shaft that occurs most commonly in a child younger than 2 years who is learning to walk. Frequently， there is no definite history of a traumatic event， and the child is brought to the office due to reluctance to bear weight on the leg. On physical examination， maximal tenderness can usually be elicited over the fracture site. On plain film， the typical findings are a nondisplaced hairline spiral fracture of the tibia and no fibular frac-ture. It is not uncommon for initial radiographs to be normal and the diagnosis of this fracture made several days after the injury when follow-up radiographs show a lucent line or periosteal reaction.\n\n【25】Osgood-Schlatter syndrome is caused by a reaction of the bone and cartilage of the tibial tubercle to repetitive stress (eg， jumping) and is believed to represent tiny stress fractures in the apophysis. The condition is also associated with rapid growth spurts. Physical examination reveals tenderness and swelling over the tibial tubercle. Running， jumping， and kneeling worsen the symptoms. The condition is managed with ice， anti-inflammatory medication， and a decrease in activity. Daily stretching of the quadriceps and hamstrings is also beneficial. Patients with severe pain may require immobilization using crutches or a knee immobilizer. Individual regulation of activity is usually effective； pain may recur until the tubercle matures(ie， ossifies completely).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

He has known bladder cancer but has been under sur￾veillance with regular cystoscopy for many years and during this time has had multiple \n\n【3】admissions with frank haematuria. These have usually been secondary to urinary tract infec￾tions. Unfortunately, on this occasion it is discovered that his bladder cancer has turned \n\n【4】aggressive and spread rapidly. He is found to have multiple metastases and it is likely that he \n\n【5】is in the terminal stage of his disease.\n\n【6】His son and daughter arrange a meeting with the oncologist and are insistent that their father \n\n【7】should not be informed of his prognosis, since they feel that he will ‘give up’. Rather, they ask \n\n【8】that ‘we should respect him and not directly tell him of his prognosis so that he might enjoy \n\n【9】the last part of his life’. The oncologist agrees to discuss their request with the other members \n\n【10】of the clinical team.\n\n【11】The palliative care nurse insists that the patient has a right to know so that any palliative \n\n【12】treatment that is given can be obtained with informed consent. The senior ward nurse takes \n\n【13】the view that the team should balance the risks and benefits of telling the truth to this patient. \n\n【14】The registrar believes that Aiko himself should be asked how much he wants to know.\n\n【15】Questions\n\n【16】• Is there a moral obligation to tell Aiko his prognosis?\n\n【17】• To what extent should cultural beliefs and practices influence your decision making?260\n\n【18】100 Cases in Clinical Ethics and Law\n\n【19】ANSWER 94\n\n【20】When informing patients of their prognosis, it is appropriate to consider the cultural slant on \n\n【21】patient-centred decision making, since it may not be universally endorsed. In contemporary \n\n【22】bioethics it is considered that respect for autonomy is best served when individuals make \n\n【23】decisions for themselves without influence from others, even on the part of their own fami￾lies. The dominant view of those involved in Aiko’s care is that autonomy should be promoted \n\n【24】through openness and truth telling.\n\n【25】Legally, it is imperative that informed consent be gained for any treatment course. In the case \n\n【26】of palliative nursing, healthcare professionals must ensure that as a team they do not create \n\n【27】any medico-legal implications for the nurse or her department. The request of Aiko’s family \n\n【28】that he should not be informed of his prognosis may lead to future problems of obtaining \n\n【29】consent. For instance, if, to offer a good standard of care, later a long-term catheter is thought \n\n【30】to be appropriate, Aiko would require the information surrounding this treatment option in \n\n【31】the light of his prognosis for him to give informed consent. However, while it may be taken \n\n【32】for granted that telling patients the truth about terminal illness is always the right thing to \n\n【33】do, many cultures assume the opposite. The nurse suggests that the doctor should inform \n\n【34】Aiko regardless of his family’s views but wider issues should be considered.\n\n【35】From an ethical point of view, respect for patient autonomy must take patient values into \n\n【36】consideration. If members of the patient’s family have informed the doctor that nondis￾closure of prognosis to elderly relatives is culturally acceptable, this should be taken into \n\n【37】account. Disclosing prognosis against the family’s advice may inadvertently cause distress to \n\n【38】the patient and set up tensions within the family. If, as the ward nurse suggests, the doctors \n\n【39】balance the risks and benefits of fully informing the patient, then the additional knowledge \n\n【40】given by the family about Japanese culture is important to take into consideration. In the \n\n【41】sphere of Japanese health culture even the interpretation of ‘risk’ and ‘benefit’ may be differ￾ent. Considering the concept of respect for the elderly, it may seem a benefit to fully inform \n\n【42】Aiko, yet this is perceived by his family as a potential harm to his dignity. Hence we can￾not use the traditional utilitarian way of measuring harm and good in order to dictate the \n\n【43】information the doctor gives. The suggestion of the registrar to ask Aiko whether he wants \n\n【44】his family to make healthcare decisions for him may seem to be the most sensible in this \n\n【45】situation.\n\n【46】From a legal point of view, patients being treated in the UK are of course subject to UK \n\n【47】healthcare laws, and in particular informed consent must be gained for any treatment. \n\n【48】However, it is important to be culturally sensitive in conveying the truth, and not disrupt \n\n【49】family communication patterns.\n\n【50】Key Points\n\n【51】• Faith, cultural and individual values should be taken into account when determin￾ing the exercise of healthcare choices.\n\n【52】• The legal requirements for disclosure should be interpreted with consideration of \n\n【53】different cultural practices.261\n\n【54】Faith, Values and Culture", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

This patient likely has a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) complicated by a pulmonary embolus. She is predisposed to DVT by long hours of inactivity and use of oral contraception. Unfractionated heparin is the most appropriate initial therapy. It works by catalyzing the activation of anti-thrombin III, decreasing the level of available thrombin, and inhibiting factor Xa. The degree of heparinization can be monitored by measuring the partial thromboplastin time (PTT), which is a measure of the intrinsic coagulation pathway.  \n\n【7】Answer A is incorrect . Bleeding time is a measure of platelet function. Any disorder of platelet function or one that affects platelet function, such as von Willebrand disease, would result in an increase in bleeding time.  \n\n【8】Answer B is incorrect . The International Normalized Ratio (INR) is a means of standardizing prothrombin time (PT) measurements from laboratory to laboratory. INR must be monitored in patients who are treated with warfarin. Therapeutic INR is between 2 and 3.  \n\n【9】Answer C is incorrect . A patient who is treated with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) needs no laboratory monitoring. However, this patient is unlikely to be treated with LMWH, which is more expensive and more difficult to reverse in the case of supratherapeutic anticoagulation. The initial therapy of choice for inpatient anticoagulation (absent specific contraindications) is still heparin.  \n\n【10】Answer E is incorrect .

These innate immune cells are the first cells to be recruited to sites of infection and inflammation， into which they migrate in large numbers from the bloodstream. Once activated， neutrophils are short-lived； after ingesting microbes and killing them， neutrophils die and are broken down by the action of macrophages， pro-ducing the pus that is characteristic of many extracellular bacterial infecti11ons. Neutrophils recognize their microbial targets mostly through invariant receptors， such as Fcy receptors and Toll-like receptors. The binding of antibody-coated(opsonized')microorganisms to Fcyreceptors on the neutrophil cell surface**\n\n【5】**Fig.25.1 Neutrophils are stored in the bone marrow and move in large numbers to sites of infection， where they act and then die. After one round of ingestion and killing of bacteria， a neutrophil dies. The dead neutrophils are eventually mopped up by long-lived tissue macrophages， which break them down. The creamy material known as pus is composed of dead neutrophils.**\n\n【6】promotes internalization of these targets by phagocytosis， followed by intracellular killing， a process that involves the production of reactive oxygen species and the activation of proteolytic enzymes and antimicrobial peptides contained in neutro-phil granules .\n\n【7】Neutrophils are generated in the bone marrow， where hematopoietic stem cells differentiate into myeloblasts， relatively large cells with a large， oval nucleus and a small amount of cytoplasm. Promyelocytes represent the next step in myeloid dif-ferentiation. Promyelocytes also have a round nucleus with diffuse chromatin， but their nucleoli tend to become less prominent as differentiation proceeds. Mature neutrophils contain several types of membrane-enclosed granules， which store enzymes and antimicrobial peptides. The primary or azurophilic granules appear at the promyelocyte stage， whereas the secondary granules become apparent only at the next step of differentiation， the myelocyte stage. Secondary granules are smaller than the primary granules and arise from the convex surface of the Golgi complex. Primary and secondary granules differ in their content. Primary granules contain myeloperoxidase， defensins， cathepsin G， and neutrophil elastase. In con-trast， secondary granules contain lactoferrin and cathelicidin.\n\n【8】The morphological features typical of neutrophils start to become apparent when myelocytes differentiate into metamyelocytes， which are characterized by an indented nucleus containing dense and clumped chromatin. Primary， secondary， and tertiary granules fill the cytoplasm， and the cell loses its ability to divide. The nucleus becomes horseshoe-shaped， and the chromatin is further condensed， a feature of the so-called ‘band neutrophil'stage. Finally， as the neutrophil matures， nuclear constrictions appear and the nucleus takes on the characteristic lobed shape.\n\n【9】In healthy adults more than 50×10° neutrophils are produced by the bone marrow and released into the circulation every day. This high rate of production is required to balance the rapid rate of neutrophil destruction and to compensate for the rela-tively short half-life of the neutrophil-around 8 hours. The normal range of neu-trophil count varies with age and ethnic group and is highly influenced by various conditions such as stress， infections， and medication.\n\n【10】An increase in the number of neutrophils in peripheral blood (neutrophilia) is often seen during infections of various kinds， as well as during stress or inflamma-tion. A decrease in the neutrophil count (neutropenia， from penia， the Latin word for deficiency'orpoverty) can reflect either decreased production ofneutrophils as a result of bone marrow suppression or malfunction， or increased consumption or destruction of neutrophils. This case shows the dramatic effects of a severe lack of neutrophils， and illustrates the essential role of neutrophils in controlling infec-tions due to extracellular bacteria.\n\n【11】**Michael Henchard， the first son of a 25-year-old healthy mother， was born after38 weeks' gestation. He remained in the nursery for 3 days， with no complications， _and was then discharged and sent home. After 2 weeks， during which he fed and_ grew well， his mother noticed a slight redness around the stump of his umbilical cord. She did not think much of it at first， but after 24 hours the redness had spread and the umbilical area had become hard and swollen. Michael became very irritable， refused to nurse， and developed a fever (38.7℃).**\n\n【12】**_His mother took him to the pediatrician， who diagnosed Michael with omphalitis (an_ infection of the umbilical stump) and immediately referred him for treatment at the**\n\n【13】**Fig. 25.2 Michael's absolute neutrophil count during hospitalization and treatment. On admission， Michael's absolute neutrophil count(ANC) was 174 cells ml-1， well below the 500 cells ml-1 that qualifies as severe neutropenia. Although his infection was controlled by antibiotics over several weeks， his ANC remained low until he was treated with recombinant human G-CSF (rhG-CSF)， a growth factor that promotes the development of neutrophils， after the diagnosis of severe congenital neutropenia.**\n\n【14】**nearest emergency room. On arrival there， Michael was lethargic and hypotonic.His temperature was 40.2℃ and his heart rate above 180 beats per minute. His breath-ing was fast and shallow and his blood pressure was low (60/35 mmHg). His abdo-men was distended and the abdominal wall was very warm to the touch， hard and erythematous (reddened).**\n\n【15】**The emergency room team immediately placed a venous catheter and treated Michael with fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Blood cultures and a peri-umbilical swab were performed to identify pathogens. A complete blood count revealed severe neutropenia with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 174 neutro- _phils ul-1. Abundant Gram-positive cocci， identified as Staphylococcus aureus， were_ cultured from the umbilical stump swab as well as from the blood.**\n\n【16】**Michael was transferred to intensive care， where he remained for almost 2 weeks. _He was treated with the antibiotic vancomycin， and with fluids and other medica-_ tion to support his cardiovascular system. His condition gradually improved and the symptoms of infection in the umbilical area subsided. Nevertheless， his neutrophil count remained very low . His physicians therefore wondered whether his neutropenia was secondary to the infection (that is， due to bone marrow suppres-sion) or whether he suffered from congenital neutropenia. To address this question， a bone marrow aspirate was performed. This showed normal numbers of granulo-cyte progenitors but a severe block in neutrophil differentiation at the promyelocyte stage and an almost complete lack of more mature forms . This suggested a diagnosis of severe congenital neutropenia (SCN).**\n\n【17】**_Treatment with subcutaneous injection of recombinant human granulocyte colony-_ stimulating factor (rhG-CSF)， at a dose of 5 ug kg- per day， was initiated. Within2 _2_ w _W_ e _E_ eks， the neutrophil count had increased to 700 cells ul-1 .Michael was discharged from the hospital and maintained on d d TrOlaily injections of rhG-CSF.He _remained mostly free of infection. A few months later， genetic testing showed that_ Michael carried a heterozygous mutation (a substitution of arginine for glycine at position 185) in the ELANE gene， which encodes the enzyme neutrophil elastase. Neither of his parents carried this mutation.**\n\n【18】**_At the age of 6 years， Michael was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia. Leu-_ kemic blast cells showed monosomy of chromosome 7 and were found to carry a somatic mutation in the gene encoding the G-CSF receptor. Michael received chemotherapy，followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation from a matched unrelated donor. He is now 13 years old and remains in good health， with full remission. His neutrophil count has normalized.**\n\n【19】**Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN).**\n\n【20】**Michael presents the classic phenotype of severe congenital neutropenia (SCN). This is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous group of hereditary dis-orders， with an estimated frequency of around two cases per million live births. Typically， patients with SCN present very early in life， usually within the first few months， mostly with recurrent， often severe， bacterial infections that involve the**\n\n【21】**_Block ofmyeloid differentiation_ _in the bone maryow._**\n\n【22】**_Robust response to treatment_ _with rhG-CSF._**\n\n【23】**_Aente myeloid leukemia with_ _MOnOSOMy 7._**\n\n【24】**Fig.25.3 Bone marrow aspirate from a patient with severe congenital neutropenia， showing the presence of myeloid progenitors but a lack of myelocytes and metamyelocytes.

Patients with SCN are also at high risk of invasive fungal infections， including those caused by Aspergillus and Candida species.**\n\n【26】SCN is characterized by marked neutropenia. To be called ‘severe， the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) must be below 500 cells ul-， but in SCN it is usually even lower-less than 200 cells ul-. In contrast， monocyte and eosinophil counts are normal or elevated. Serum levels of immunoglobulins are often increased.\n\n【27】The differential diagnosis of SCN includes various forms of neutropenia due to an impaired production or accelerated destruction of neutrophils. Viral infections， but also some bacterial infections， in particular Salmonella and bacterial infec-tion of the blood (sepsis)， can cause a suppression of myelopoiesis that can last for several weeks. Impaired generation of neutrophils can also be part of a broader spectrum of genetically determined disorders of bone marrow function， known as bone marrow failure syndromes. These include Fanconi anemia， dyskeratosis congenita， Diamond-Blackfan anemia， Shwachman-Diamond syndrome， carti-lage hair hypoplasia， and others. These disorders typically also show other hema-tological abnormalities， and may present with distinctive extra-hematological features (for example short stature in Fanconi anemia， and diarrhea with pan-creatic insufficiency in Shwachman-Diamond syndrome). Finally， neutropenia can also reflect myelodysplasia， a condition of ineffective production of myeloid cells in the bone marrow. Myelodysplasia may progress to leukemia， with replace-ment of the bone marrow hematopoietic matrix by clonal proliferation of leuke-mic cells. Monosomy 7 is a chromosomal abnormality that is frequently observed in patients with myelodysplasia and is associated with a higher risk of leukemic transformation，\n\n【28】Accelerated destruction of neutrophils can reflect an immune mechanism， as observed in the phenomenon of autoimmune neutropenia， which is often seen in systemic autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus . Transplacental passage of anti-neutrophil antibodies from an autoimmune mother may cause alloimmune neutropenia in the infant for up to several months after birth. Neutropenia may also be secondary to hypersplenism， a condition of spleen enlargement， associated with retention and destruction of neutrophils in the spleen. Neutropenia is also associated with warts， hypogammaglobulinemia， infections， and myelokathexis (retention of mature neutrophils in the bone mar-row) syndrome (WHIM syndrome； see Case 22).\n\n【29】A diagnosis of SCN is supported by characteristic findings of ‘maturation arrest at the promyelocyte or myelocyte stage in the bone marrow. Several genetic defects have recently been described in patients with SCN， including mutations in the genes encoding neutrophil elastase (ELANE)， the anti-apoptotic protein HCLS1-associated protein X1 (HAX1)， the p14 endosomal protein (MAPBPIP)， growth factor independent-1 transcription repressor (GFI1)， the G-CSF receptor (CSF3R)， glucose-6-phosphatase(G6PC3)， the vacuolar protein sorting 45 homolog (VPS45)， and the homolog of Jagunal 1 (JAGN1). For some of these mutations， the neutro-penia is associated with other manifestations. For instance，neurological problems are frequently seen in patients with HAX1 mutations. Patients with G6PC3 defi-ciency present a prominent superficial venous pattern， heart abnormalities， and genito-urinary anomalies. Mutations of VPS45 are associated with myelofibrosis， renal extra-medullary hematopoiesis and defective platelet aggregation， in addi-tion to SCN. JAGN1 deficiency is characterized by an arrest at the promyelocyte/myelocyte stage， with severe reduction of granules and an enlarged endoplasmic reticulum (ER)， reflecting ER stress. Activating mutations of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome gene (WAS； see Case 16) have also been shown to cause SCN.\n\n【30】**Severe neutropenia can also be present in other genetic disorders as part of a broader phenotype， as observed in patients with Chediak-Higashi syndrome ， Griscelli syndrome type 2， Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 2， Barth syndrome， Cohen syndrome， Pearson's syndrome， glycogenosis 1b， and others.**\n\n【31】Conditions of chronic neutropenia must be distinguished from other situations in which the neutropenia is intermittent and follows a cyclic pattern. In the latter， neutrophil counts fluctuate between normal and very low， with the lowest ANC usually occurring every 18-21 days . These conditions are termed cyclic neutropenia. Determination of the ANC once a week for several weeks is impor-tant to document the cycling and establish the diagnosis. Cyclic neutropenia has been associated with ELANE mutations； however， as in Michael’s case， mutations in the same gene may also cause chronic neutropenia.\n\n【32】**In the past， patients with SCN tended to die during the first years of life as a result of overwhelming infections. Since the introduction of treatment with rhG-CSF， the vast majority of the patients can attain relatively normal neutrophil counts， with reduced risk of developing severe infections. The mechanism by which rhG-CSF might increase the neutrophil count is not well defined， but may reflect increased stimulation of early myeloid progenitors. However， some patients fail to respond to rhG-CSF and others (especially those with ELANE mutations) are at increased risk of developing myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukemia. Secondary mutations in the G-CSF receptor that cause premature truncation of the intracellular tail of the receptor increase the risk of acute myeloidleukemia. Somatic mutations ofthe RUNX1 gene， which encodes for a transcription factor， have been also frequently observed in patients with SCN progressing to myeloid leukemia. In such cases，and in those who fail to respond to rhG-CSF， allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell trans-plantation remains the only curative approach.**", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The  patient was treated with naloxone, and subsequently with buprenorphine. \n\n【20】What is the mechanism of action of these two drugs?\n\n【21】2. This patient has been exposed to a number of drugs in the history relayed above, \n\n【22】including heroin, fentanyl, buprenorphine and naloxone. Can you suggest which of \n\n【23】these drugs are depicted in the dose-response curves A, B, C and D?42\n\n【24】100 Cases in Clinical Pharmacology, Therapeutics and Prescribing\n\n【25】ANSWERS\n\n【26】1. Naloxone is a non-selective competitive µ-opioid receptor antagonist that can be \n\n【27】administered by intravenous, intramuscular or nasal routes to treat opioid over￾doses. Naloxone competitively binds to the µ-opioid receptor, thus preventing \n\n【28】both endogenous and exogenous opioids from binding and exerting their effects. \n\n【29】Naloxone is rapidly distributed and metabolised and thus has a rapid duration of \n\n【30】effect. Patients with significant opioid toxicity may require multiple doses of nalox￾one, or even a continuous intravenous infusion to prevent respiratory depression.\n\n【31】 Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the µ-opioid receptor that is prescribed to \n\n【32】reduce dependence on opioids, such as heroin. The drug has a strong affinity for \n\n【33】the µ-opioid receptor, competitively preventing other opioids from binding. Due to \n\n【34】its partial agonist activity, buprenorphine does not induce significant pleasurable \n\n【35】effects such as euphoria, in contrast with other opioids.\n\n【36】2. The dose-response curves show the potency and efficacy of the four drugs discussed: \n\n【37】heroin, fentanyl, buprenorphine and naloxone. Drugs A and B are similarly effica￾cious, both achieving a similar level of response to the drugs. Drug A is more potent \n\n【38】than Drug B however, meaning that smaller doses of Drug A are required to achieve \n\n【39】maximal response compared with Drug B. In  this scenario, Drug A  is fentanyl, \n\n【40】which is an extremely potent opioid that is commonly mixed with heroin, and small \n\n【41】quantities of this drug can cause fatal overdoses. Drug B is heroin.\n\n【42】 Drug C is the partial µ-opioid receptor agonist, Buprenorphine, which is con￾siderably less efficacious compared with fentanyl and heroin. Drug D is naloxone, \n\n【43】the µ-opioid receptor antagonist that competes with other opioids and thus reduces \n\n【44】their analgesic and depressive effects.\n\n【45】Key Points\n\n【46】1. Naloxone is a non-selective competitive µ-opioid receptor antagonist that can \n\n【47】be administered by intravenous, intramuscular or nasal routes to treat opioid \n\n【48】overdoses.\n\n【49】2. Dose-response curves plot the biological response for a particular drug against \n\n【50】the doses required to achieve that response. This allows us to assess and compare \n\n【51】the efficacy and potency of drugs.43", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Her obstetrician recommends that she have a series of screening tests. One of these tests shows an elevated serum a-fetoprotein level. Which of the following is most likely responsible for this result?\n\n【1】> (A) Bilateral renal agenesis\n\n【2】> (B) Failure of the ductus arteriosus to close\n\n【3】> (C) Inadequate folic acid intake\n\n【4】> (D) Inheritance of a recessive disorder\n\n【5】> (E) Nondisjunction occurring during meiosis\n\n【6】 **Answer**: The correct answer is C . An elevated a-fetoprotein (AFP) level in amniotic fluid and maternal serum may indicate neural tube defects such as spina bifida, meningocele, and meningomyelocele. These defects are caused by the failure of the caudal portion of the neural tube to close. The AFP level is elevated because AFP is leaked into the amniotic fluid from the neural tube defect. Children with these defects suffer from a varying degree of symptoms that usually include motor and sensory defects in the lower extremities and dysfunction of bowel and bladder control. Folate deficiency during the first four weeks of pregnancy has been implicated in causing neural tube defects. Drugs that increase the risk of neural tube defect include valproate and carbamazepine.  \n\n【7】Answer A is incorrect . Bilateral renal agenesis (Potter syndrome) is caused by disruption in the interaction between the ureteric bud and the metanephrogenic tissue. Because the fetus does not produce urine (which is a component of amniotic fluid), there is a smaller volume of amniotic fluid than normal. This is described by the term oligohydramnios. The smaller amount of protective fluid results in pulmonary hypoplasia, fetal compression with altered facies, and positioning defects of hands and feet. Bilateral renal agenesis is not compatible with life. Oligohydramnios, not increased AFP levels, would be noted in this case.  \n\n【8】Answer B is incorrect . The ductus arteriosus is a connection between the pulmonary artery and the aorta that allows oxygenated blood from the placenta to bypass the fetal lungs and enter the systemic circulation. This pathway should be open during gestation and is not an abnormality. At birth, as the infant takes a breath, an increase in oxygen content causes a decrease in prostaglandins, resulting in closure of the connection. If the ductus arteriosus remains patent after birth, the baby can be given indomethacin to help stimulate the vessel to close.  \n\n【9】Answer D is incorrect . It is possible that this fetus inherited a recessive disorder such as cystic fibrosis, phenylketonuria, or sickle cell anemia. However, these diseases are usually tested for in patients with a family history using DNA studies of fetal cells collected from amniotic fluid, not by measuring AFP levels.  \n\n【10】Answer E is incorrect . Nondisjunction during meiosis is the usual cause of trisomy 21, the genetic abnormality in Down syndrome. Trisomy 21 is more common in women >35 years old, so this patient’s age puts her at increased risk of having a baby with Down syndrome. However, unlike neural tube defects, Down syndrome causes a decrease in AFP levels and an increase in β-human chorionic gonadotropin levels.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

He was initially diagnosed with pityriasis rosea and reported complete resolution of the eruption. However, a similar rash recurred eight years later. An alternative medicine specialist had prescribed an oral anti-fungal and later topical steroid without resolution.\n\n【12】Physical Examination\n--------------------\n\n【13】Involving approximately 75 % body surface area (BSA), he had well-demarcated hyper- and hypopigmented discrete round and ovoid variably sized patches on the trunk, buttocks, thighs and the intertriginous areas. Some of the lesions had fine scale . A full lymph node examination revealed bilateral axillary non-tender lymphadenopathy.\n\n【14】Figure 10.1\n\n【15】Patch stage mycosis fungoides. Well-demarcated hyper- and hypopigmented discrete round and ovoid variably sized patches are noted on the chest, stomach ( a ), back, buttocks, thighs and the intertriginous areas ( b ). Some of the lesions had fine scale\n\n【16】Differential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【17】The patient’s clinical presentation was felt to be consistent with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Pityriasis rosea is a common skin disorder found in children and young adults and manifests as an acute, self-limiting, papulosquamous eruption, usually beginning with a “herald patch.” Tinea versicolor is characterized by hypopigmented or hyperpigmented macules and patches on the chest and the back, typically in young active adults. Patients with inflammatory vitiligo have lesions with an erythematous, raised border, which is present from the onset of vitiligo or may appear several months or years after the initial onset; mild pruritus may be present. Pityriasis lichenoides chronica presents as small erythematous–to–reddish brown papules, with fine scale. Atopic dermatitis with post-inflammatory dyspigmentation is also included in the differential.\n\n【18】Histopathology\n--------------\n\n【19】A punch biopsy showed a moderately dense atypical lymphocytic infiltrate lining up at the dermoepidermal junction with exocytosis of cells and Pautrier microabscesses in the epidermis. Flow cytometry showed cluster of differentiation (CD)3+/CD4+/CD7-/CD8-/CD30- T lymphocytes.\n\n【20】Imaging\n-------\n\n【21】A computed axial tomography scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis revealed 6 mm left lower lobe pulmonary nodule, bilateral axillary, pelvic and inguinal lymphadenopathy. A positron emission tomography (PET) scan showed increased 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake of the skin of the trunk, lower extremities, face and scalp as well as increased uptake of the lymph nodes of the neck, axillary, external iliac and inguinal areas. Right femoral lymph node biopsy revealed no abnormalities. A Sezary preparation of the blood showed no atypical cells.\n\n【22】Diagnosis\n---------\n\n【23】Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, Mycosis Fungoides subtype, Stage IIA (T <sub>2 </sub> , N <sub>1 </sub> , M <sub>0 </sub> , B <sub>0 </sub> )\n\n【24】Case Treatment\n--------------\n\n【25】A discussion of the diagnosis, natural history, and treatment was discussed. Because patients presenting with early stage disease very rarely have systemic involvement, skin-directed therapy is the appropriate choice. He was started on topical nitrogen mustard 0.02 % gel once a day. He was also started on narrow band UVB phototherapy three times a week. At 6 months follow-up, moderate improvement was noted in approximately 75 % of his lesions. He is followed by Dermatology every 6 months.\n\n【26】Treatment for Advanced Stages IIB, III, IV\n------------------------------------------\n\n【27】TSEBT and phototherapy, though primarily having skin-directed mechanisms, can also be used for more advanced stages. Other treatment options include systemic therapy such as oral retinoids, interferons, histone deactylase inhibitors, extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP), antifolates, allogeneic stem cell transplant and a variety of combination therapies.\n\n【28】### Retinoids\n\n【29】Oral retinoids that have undergone or are currently undergoing investigation for treatment of CTCL/ MF include isotretinoin, acitretin and etretinate. Oral bexarotene is the only FDA approved oral retinoid for refractory CTCL at all stages.\n\n【30】### Interferons\n\n【31】IFNα has gained popularity owing to relatively fewer side effects in comparison to IFNβ or IFNγ. In addition, these side effects can easily be ameliorated with dose reduction (Olsen and Bunn 1995 ) (Olsen). IFNα is given at low doses via subcutaneous injection of 1–3 million units \\[MUs\\] three times weekly with a gradual increase in dose to 9–12 MUs daily as tolerated. Maintenance therapy is continued for at least 3 months and then tapered over 6–12 months (Olsen and Bunn 1995 ). It is administered as monotherapy but is even more effective when combined with PUVA therapy for stages IB-IIB (Kuzel et al. 1995 ). In skin of color patients with advanced stage disease that is refractory to treatment, combination of IFNα and PUVA is particularly worth trying given the good response to PUVA that is often observed in this population.\n\n【32】### Histone Deactylase Inhibitors\n\n【33】Panobinostat and vorinostat both work by increasing acetylation of protein involved in oncogenic pathways. Vorinostat is FDA approved for advanced disease and given orally at 400 mg daily (Duvic et al. 2009 ). Panobinostat is given by mouth at 20 mg three times per week (Duvic et al. 2013 ). Both drugs have shown have a benign safety profile at these doses and are relatively effective for refractory MF.\n\n【34】### Antifolates\n\n【35】Methotrexate and pralatrexate are both FDA approved for treatment of refractory and relapsed CTCL. The mechanism of action for both involves inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase. Methotrexate is given at a median weekly dose of 25 mg (Zackheim et al. 2003 ), while pralatrexate is administered at a dose of 15 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> weekly (Foss et al. 2012 ). The once weekly regimen allows for a manageable regimen and therefore medication adherence.\n\n【36】### Extracorporeal Photopheresis (ECP)\n\n【37】ECP involves separating circulating mononuclear cells by leukapheresis, mixing the cells with 8-methoxypsoralen, exposing the mixture with ultraviolet A light and then reinfusing into the patient. It is approved for palliative treatment of CTCL given on 2 consecutive days every 2–4 weeks over a period of at least 6 months (Arulogun et al. 2008 ). It is also effective and recommended for erythrodermic CTCL (Edelson et al. 1987 ). Though a viable option with a relatively benign side-effect profile, a single institution study by Agi et al. showed ECP is less likely to be offered as a treatment option to black patients compared to white patients (Agi et al. 2015 ).\n\n【38】### Chemotherapy\n\n【39】Chemotherapeutic agents are used as palliative monotherapies in those with refractory or relapsing therapy that no longer responds to initial therapy. Monotherapies used for treatment of MF include gemcitabine and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (Dummer et al. 2012 ; Duvic et al. 2006 ). Multiagent regimens consist of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, VP-16 and prednisolone in various combinations. It is important to be aware that as combination therapy, these agents achieve complete and partial remission in tumor stage MF but do not maintain remission (Molin et al. 1980 ).\n\n【40】Key Points\n----------\n\n【41】*   Classic mycosis fungoides presents with patches and plaques on non sunexposed areas that may slowly evolve into tumors.\n\n【42】*   Early CTCL in skin of color may resemble classic inflammatory dermatoses, such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, vitiligo, or lichen planus, with reactive T cells and other immune cells.\n\n【43】*   The early recognition and diagnosis of CTCL in skin of color is facilitated by a correlation of clinical, histological, and cytomorphological findings, and can decrease the morbidity and mortality currently associated with this disease.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The patient’s past medical history includes well-controlled hypertension， hypercholesterolemia， benign prostatic hyper-plasia， diabetes mellitus， and an 80-pack-year history of smoking. He has no known drug allergies. His medication list includes metoprolol， lisinopril， and lovastatin. He lives on a farm， and often exerts himself physically doing chores or walking long distances.\n\n【2】The patient is 5 ft 10 in tall and weighs 90 kg.

Obtain a better understanding of the options for pain management follow-ing major vascular surgery.The risks of this procedure emanate from the surgery itself， as well as this atient’s pre-existingmedical condition. Even when repaired usingan endovascular technique， an AAA repair is still major vascular surgery， and carries the risk of a major blood loss. The anatomic location of the aneurysm with respect to ease of repair and the location of the renal arteries， and the duration of the aorta’s cross clamp time， also influences the operative risk. All in all， his condition is good compared to many patients who undergo this pro-cedure. He has hypertension， peripheral vascular disease (which also carries the risk of coronary artery disease)， long-standing diabetes with the risk of end-organ damage， and a long history of smoking， which suggests the possibility of compromised lung function as well. Nevertheless， his functional capacity is good， exceeding 6 to 8 METs. Thus his ASA Physical Status classification is ASA 3. Combining the risks of this operating with the risks emanating from his medical condition， his attendant risk for this procedure is moderate or high.\n\n【11】Thistpatient prefers general anesthesia， although he understands that regional anesthesia such as an epidural catheter for neuraxial blockade is a viable and safe option as well. He will be monitored using the standard intra-operative monitoring paradigm (ECG， blood pressure cuff， pulse oximetry， capnography， and body temperature). Since he is undergoing an AAA repair， an arterial line will be placed to allow continuous monitoring of arterial pres-sure and frequent blood _1：gas analysis， and a large bore intravenous (16 gauge_ or larger) will be placed. The use of central venous pressure (CVP) monitors， pulmonary artery catheters， and/or transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is optional and should be tailored to specific situations. Given his good func-tional capacity and lack of significant heart disease， the placement of a CVP line is most likely to be adequate for the monitoring of volume status， in addition to providing additional intravenous access. Urine output should be measured via and recorded at frequent time intervals to assist in the assessment of the adequacy of tissue perfusion.ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURYSM： A focal dilatation of the aorta greater than 50% of its normal arterial diameter. It is often described in relation to the renalarteries as either a suprarenal or an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.METABOLIC EQUIVALENT (MET)： The metabolic rate consuming 3.5 mL of oxygen per kilogram of body weight per minute or a metabolic rate con-suming 1 kcal per kilogram of body weight per hour. 通用删除1(英):<u>(For examples of the energy requirements for common daily activities， please see Table 18-1.)</u>An AAA is observed at autopsy in 0.5% to 3.2% of the population， and is the primary cause of death in 1.3% of men between 65 and 85 years of age in developed countries. AAAs are more common in men than in women， with a 2：1 preponderance in people under the age of 80， though the frequency of its occurrence approaches 1：1 in older individuals. It is more common in white males than African American males.\n\nGenerally， aneurysms that are asymptomatic are followed clinically until they reach 6 cm in diameter， since 6 cm is the maximal size which can be determined by imaging studies alone. Estimating the size or following the pro-gression in size of an aneurysm over 6 cm in diameter requires an invasive intervention.| Table 18-1 DAILY ACTIVITIES AND ENERGY REQUIREMENTS  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| DAILY ACTIVITY  | METABOLIC EQUIVALENTS (METS)  |\n| Lifting and carrying objects (9-20 kg)  | 4-5  |\n| Lifting and carrying objects > 20kg  | \\>6  |\n| Walking 1 mile (level) in 20 minutes  | 3-4  |\n| Running/walking on an incline  | \\>6  |\n| Golf  | 4-5  |\n| Gardening (digging)  | 3-5  |\n| Do-it-yourself， wallpapering  | 4-5  |\n| Light housework (ironing，polishing)  | 2-4  |\n| Heavy housework (making beds， scrubbing floors， cleaning windows)  | 3-6  |\n| Competitive sports， swimming，aerobics  | \\>6  |\n| Heavy shoveling， digging ditches  | \\>6  |\n\n【13】Abdominal aortic aneurysm repairs， whether open or endovascular， are major vascular procedures with an intermediate risk for perioperative cardiac events. A complete preoperative workup prior to either open or endovascular repair should include a comprehensive history and physical examination. A detailed assessment of the patient's exercise tolerance is of paramount impor-tance， and is typically documented in the record in terms of METs. For patients undergoing procedures with an inherent risk at the intermediate level， who are asymptomatic and able to perform at 4 METs or greater， the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association(ACC/AHA) recommends further cardiac testing only if the test will change the course of cardiac management (coronary artery stenting or bypass， or myocardial valve replacement， etc.) prior to the operative procedure.Figure 18-1. Cerebral blood flow is dependent on mean arterial pressure (MAP).\n\n【14】. In addition， hypertensive patients may also have left ventricular hypertrophy accompanied by diastolic dysfunction . The thickened， hypertrophied ventricle requires more perfusion to meet its oxygen demands. Moreover， coronary perfusion， which happens largely during diastole， may be compromised by diastolic dysfunction.Figure 18-2.Effects of uncontrolled hypertension-left ventricular hypertrophy.The second most important factor to be considered during an open AAA十epair is blood loss. In normalpatients， large amounts of blood loss (greater than 15% of estimated blood volume) result in a hemodynamic instability manifested by hypotension and tachycardia. In“vasculopaths，\"this response is magnified because of the lack of compliance in the patient’s vessels and often， the left ventricle. In this setting， even smaller amounts of sudden blood loss can cause profound drops in blood pressure. Blood loss is treated aggressively with fluids or blood products， depending on the patient’s hemoglobin at the time of infusion. If the hemoglobin is greater than 7 g/dL， most practitioners are comfortable with the infusion of a crystalloid such as normal saline or a colloid such as albumin or hetastarch. If the hemoglobin is less than 7 g/dL， blood transfusions should be utilized to support the bleeding and hemodynamics.Several options are available for postoperative pain control. Prior to the induction of anesthesia， an epidural or intrathecal catheter may be placed in the operating room. Contraindications to these techniques include localized infection at the site of procedure， thrombocytopenia， and medications that alter coagulation such as preoperative use of antiplatelet agents or anticoagu-lants such as heparin or warfarin. Epidural or intrathecal techniques reduce the postoperative requirements for parenteral narcotics， and therefore improve patient interaction， decrease somnolence， and provide superior pain control. On the other hand， neuraxial techniques， particularly when an opi-ate is administered， require close monitoring at a level that is not always avail-able within an institution. Neuraxial techniques also carry the same risks of any regional anesthetic with regards to catheter placement， nerve impair-ment， or an exacerbation of back pain.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

New skin lesions had appeared， beginning at least 6 months earlier， initially in the proximal left arm and elbow area， with several other lesions in other body sites in the subsequent 3 months. The skin lesions got larger over time.\n\n【3】The review of systems showed that the patient did not feel ill； he looked healthy. He had no itch or pain， but anesthesia at the center of the flat older skin lesions. There were no chills or fever， no body aches， except for old arthritis of the shoulders. He had no skin abscesses， no nasal discharge， and no cough.\n\n【4】The past medical history was significant for recurrent impetigo in the upper and lower extremities over the past 2-3 years (these are different from the newer skin lesions). He had been under the care of a dermatologist for 2 years， with\n\n【5】mainly topical agents prescribed for the impetigo. Two skin punch biopsies done by the dermatologist on the left forearm on 3/30/09 showed the following from the two sites： suppurative folliculitis and impetiginized non-specific ulcer. No fungal elements were found on the biopsies. The patient was treated over sev-eral months with topical and systemic antibiotic regimens， antifungal， and topical steroid therapy， without much effect. He had arthritis of the shoulder and elbows for years. No other serious medical or surgical problem was reported by the patient.\n\n【6】A biopsy of one of the new flat skin lesions was done on 9/10/10， following which he was referred to the office on 9/29/10.\n\n【7】The epidemiologic history suggested that he did a lot of vocational work in the yard， did woodwork， worked with and had contact with lawn， soil， and grass. He had bought an old， previously abandoned house， with overgrown yard and lawn， several years earlier. He rebuilt this house over a 10-month period， including cleaning， clearing， plumbing work， and crawling under the elevation. He had two healthy dogs (an outside dog， aged 7 years， and an inside dog 3 years old). He had been married to his wife for 22 years. She was healthy and had no skin lesions.\n\n【8】The family and social history included a daughter， aged 20 years， who was healthy， and lived at home with the parents. The patient worked as a firefighter. He did not smoke and very rarely drank alcohol. He had no drug allergies. He was on no regular medications， except for PRN tramadol and naproxen for arthritis， but was recently prescribed alpraxolam (0.25 mg) PRN， for sleep and anxiety.\n\n【9】On examination， he was alert and oriented， slightly anxious， but in no acute distress. The vital signs were as follows： BP 130/80， RR 20， HR 76， temperature98.1 °F； height 5'9\" and weight 161 pounds. The head and neck exam was unre-markable. He had normal oral mucosa， several tooth fillings， and no lesions in the face， nose， mouth， or neck. The heart， lung， and abdomen were normal. The external genitalia showed a normal circumcised male phallus. The lymph nodes were not enlarged in the neck， axilla， or groin. The neurologic exam was normal， except for the skin lesions. The upper extremities were unremarkable， except the skin lesions to be discussed below. The lower extremities showed mild changes suggestive of tinea pedis between the fourth and fifth toes， but otherwise were normal.\n\n【10】The skin findings were as follows. The left elbow radial forearm showed a large lesion with a flat center that was dry and anesthetic； the extensor area just above the right elbow showed a discoid， eczematous area with distinct borders. There were also a few younger lesions noted in the left and right flanks， as well as inner and outer elbow areas. The right posterolateral flank lesion was about3-4 cm in size， raised， oval shaped or elliptical， and purplish. Note： the oldest lesion was in the radial left elbow； the biopsied site was one of the younger lesions， in the right upper arm extensor elbow area. A sketch of the left forearm lesion is shown in Fig. 13.3a.\n\n【11】Figure 13.3a Sketch of left proximal extensor forearm skin lesion. The 5-6 cm lesion showed an anesthetic flat center， with surrounding raised borders (adapted from a photograph taken in the office on 9/29/10).\n\n【12】_· What are the differential diagnoses that come to mind， based on the data available so_ _far and the physical examination findings?_\n\n【13】**Results of preliminary investigations**\n\n【14】The chest x-ray done on 9/29/10 was normal. Chemistries done on 10/1/10showed theefollowing： sodium/potassium 141/4.5.， respectively，glucose93 mg/dL， BUN/creatinine 16/1.1， respectively. Liver function tests and lipid profile were normal. The CBC showed a WBC of 6.3， H/H 12.6/39.7， respectively， MCV 61.6， and platelet count 140； differential： 71 P， 21 L， 7 M， 1 eosinophil. HlV serology was negative； glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) level18 U/g hemoglobin (normal range 7-20).\n\n【15】**Case discussion**\n\n【16】First， let us discuss the character of the skin lesions. These were typically large(several centimeters) and flat， with numbness developing in the center as the lesions got older. There was no itch or pain associated with the lesions. The lesions became flatter and dry in the center with aging， and were associated with loss of\n\n【17】**hair. There were no lesions on the face or mouth area. The lesions were noted in bilateral upper extremities， especially the elbow， and also flank areas.**\n\n【18】_· Do these additional descriptions influence your differential diagnoses?_\n\n【19】Our initial differential diagnoses before review of the biopsy included the following.\n\n【20】**·Sarcoidosis**\n\n【21】**· Annular psoriasis**\n\n【22】·Non-specific dermatitis\n\n【23】· Atypical mycobacterial infection\n\n【24】· Deep fungal infection\n\n【25】·Subcutaneous mycosis (e.g. dematiaceous fungal infection)\n\n【26】· Systemic lupus erythematosus\n\n【27】**· Cutaneous leishmaniasis**\n\n【28】_·Leprosy (Mycobacterium leprae)_\n\n【29】The histopathology of the skin punch biopsy of the right upper arm done on9/10/10， a biopsy of skin to the level of the subcutis， was described as showing non-necrotizing granulomatous inflammation involving the dermis with numer-ous acid-fast-positive organisms.\n\n【30】_·How do the new findings modify your differential diagnoses?_\n\n【31】More detailed characterization of the histopathologic findings revealed the fol-lowing in the histopathology report：\n\n【32】The epidermisSexhibitedlhyperkeratosis _and_ focalacanthosis. Portions of the superficial dermis display fibrosis consistent with scar. In the dermis there are focal infiltrates of non-necrotizing granulomatous inflammation admixed with a moderate lympho-cytic inflammatory infiltrate. In focal areas， inflammatory infiltrate displays a perineural distribution. Numerous AFB are present in Fite-stained sections. No AFB or fungal organisms are identified in either routine AFB or PAS-stained sections， respectively. No foreign material is identified under polarized light.\n\n【33】_·What is your final diagnosis?_\n\n【34】The final histopathologic diagnosis was noted by the dermatopathologist as fol-IOWS：\n\n【35】The histopathologic findings show granulomatous inflammation and numerous acid-fast-positive organisms in Fite-stained sections， consistent with a mycobacterial infection. Given the focal perineural pattern of inflammatory infiltrate， positive staining of numerous organisms in Fite-stained sections， and absence of staining in routine AFB stained sections， the findings are suggestive of the lepromatous type of leprosy.\n\n【36】_· Preliminary diagnosis： Leprosy (Mycobacterium leprae infection)._\n\n【37】**Follow-up findings and more data on the patient**\n\n【38】Following extensive discussions with the patient and review of the epidemiol-ogy， as well as review of the histopathology of the skin biopsy done earlier， a tentative diagnosis was made. A call was made to a specialized center to discuss this diagnosis. The patient suggested (and I agreed) that he should be referred to this tertiary center， specializing in Hansen’s disease. A decision was then made to refer the patient to this center for further work-up， treatment， and follow-up.\n\n【39】**Follow-up at the Hansen's disease center**\n\n【40】Work-up for definitive diagnosis and treatment was initiated with the National Hansen's Disease Programs (NHDP) in Baton Rouge， LA. At the NHDP， the patient had additional skin biopsy just above the right elbow and skin smears performed from typical sites， which showed high bacterial index in some places and negative findings in other places.\n\n【41】Treatment with three drugs was started， with follow-up scheduled every 3months. Laboratory tests to be followed included CBC and liver function tests. His treatment was scheduled to last for 24 months.\n\n【42】Months later， during a follow-up visit， the diagnosis of thalassemia minor was confirmed when the patient became symptomatic with shortness of breath while on treatment (he was then found to be severely anemic). The anemia was thought to be secondary to dapsone， even though the screening G6PD level was normal. The dapsone was stopped and replaced with clarithromycin， with the new three-drug regimen being rifampin， clofazimen， and clarithromycin.\n\n【43】The patient has completed a 24-month treatment program， according to the NHDP protocol. Follow-up by this center will still continue for years.\n\n【44】**Epidemiology of leprosy and Mycobacterium leprae infection in this patient**\n\n【45】This patient was relatively healthy and looked well. He had multiple skin patches(之6 lesions)， with central areas of anesthesia. His symptoms had been ongoing for at least 6-12 months or longer， although there was some concern initially that he may have had bacterial impetigo in 2009. At that time the punch biopsy showed suppurative folliculitis and impetiginized non-specific ulcer.\n\n【46】One of the key epidemiologic risk factors identified in this patient was that he was exposed to an armadillo-infested environment over a prolonged period， while renovating his home. He confirmed that the grounds of the abandoned old building that he bought were infested with armadillos. The renovation included crawling under buildings， doing plumbing work， and other activities that led to prolonged contact with contaminated soil and armadillo-infested grounds. It is thought that this was the most likely way in which he may have acquired the infection.\n\n【47】The literature suggests that currently， most cases of leprosy worldwide are from S.E. Asia (India， Indonesia， Bangladesh)， followed by the Americas (e.g. Brazil)， then Africa (e.g. Nigeria) \\[1，2\\]. However， these data are based mostly on passive case finding and not active case-finding reports. Between 1985 and2010， the number of registered cases fell from 5.4 million to 244，796， while the prevalence rate per 10，000 fell from 21.1 to 0.37.\n\n【48】In the United States， endemic cases have been identified in New York City， Louisiana， Texas， and Mississippi. According to the NHDP， 205 new cases were detected in the US in 2010 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. About 6500 cases were registered in 2006 with the NHDP， the vast majority of these being in Hispanic and Asian immigrants； 75%of new US cases annually are among immigrants. Some cases in native-born US citizens may be due to overseas exposure， and some to exposure to infected armadillos. In some cases no history of exposure can be established. In North America (USA)， leprosy appears sometimes to be a zoonosis (specifically from armadillos).\n\n【49】Our patient most likely acquired his leprosy locally through direct skin or mucous membrane contact to secretions or tissue from armadillos that infested the grounds of his old house.\n\n【50】Leprosy is a chronic disease that produces sores on the skin and mucous mem-branes， and infects nerves， producing loss of sensation in the affected areas \\[1，3\\]. Clinically， the disease appears as two types. In the more virulent form， or lepro-matous leprosy， the numerous sores contain many bacteria； in the milder form， or tuberculoid leprosy， fewer sores appear because of the body's immune response to the infection. Signs of the disease often do not appear for many years. While leprosy is rarely fatal， it can cause permanent disfigurements.\n\n【51】**Leprosy in armadillos 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>**\n\n【52】Nine-banded armadillos _(Dasypus novemcinctus)_ dare naturally infectedwith Mycobacterium leprae and have been implicated in zoonotic transmission of leprosy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Studies have found infected armadillos in wide-ranging areas across the south-central regions of the US， especially Texas and Louisiana 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Since the leprosy bacillus concentrates in the body's extremities (e.g. fingers， ears) in people， scientists have suggested that the armadillo's susceptibility to leprosy was very likely due to its unusually low body temperature of 90°F (33°C)， which is more than 8°lower than the temperature of humans and other mammals.\n\n【53】Although the risk of transmission to humans appears low， scientists are still not sure how leprosy is spread to the human population from this animal. However， armadillos can shed leprosy bacilli into the environment in bodily secretions， and bacilli might survive extracellularly in the environment for short periods 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Prolonged contact with contaminated environments may therefore be relevant to the acquisition of leprosy from the armadillo.\n\n【54】Infection with M. leprae\n\n【55】Figure 13.3b The different clinical classifications of leprosy using both the World Health Organization and the Ridley-Joplin systems.

She is approached by a member \n\n【2】of the occupational health team who asks if she would like to have her annual winter flu \n\n【3】immunisation, stating that ‘all the other staff are having it’ and that she will get a ‘flu fighter’ \n\n【4】badge if she does. Claire is not sure if she wants to have it; she has heard people often get ill \n\n【5】after the injection and she has never had the flu anyway.\n\n【6】Question\n\n【7】• Is there a moral obligation for front-line NHS staff to have the flu immunisation?170\n\n【8】100 Cases in Clinical Ethics and Law\n\n【9】ANSWER 63\n\n【10】Front-line healthcare workers are offered the flu vaccine annually. Advertising targets front￾line staff. Occupational health staff visit wards to easily facilitate immunisations, and some￾times incentives, such as chocolate and pens, are given to those who take up immunisation. \n\n【11】Whilst strongly encouraged, it is not currently compulsory for front-line staff to have the flu \n\n【12】vaccine.\n\n【13】The main proposed benefits of flu immunisation are that it may:\n\n【14】• Prevent staff transmitting flu to, and then between, patients\n\n【15】• Protect healthcare workers themselves from contracting flu, thus reducing sick leave \n\n【16】which can be particularly detrimental during winter pressures\n\n【17】The evidence regarding the effectiveness of the flu vaccine is disputed, and this has particu￾larly come to light with new evolving strains of flu, against which immunisation may be less \n\n【18】effective.\n\n【19】Some might argue that Claire has a moral obligation to be immunised. As a HCA, Claire \n\n【20】has a duty of care to protect her vulnerable patients, and accepting immunisation could be \n\n【21】considered part of this duty. The principle of non-maleficence requires that she does what she \n\n【22】can to avoid harming patients, and flu immunisation, even if not fully effective, may be one \n\n【23】way of doing this. The harms to Claire (for example, a sore arm, mild side effects or extremely \n\n【24】rare serious effects) may be outweighed by the benefits to patients, providing a consequen￾tialist justification for her consenting to immunisation. Furthermore, by accepting the risk \n\n【25】of such harms for the benefit of her patients, she is acting as a ‘virtuous’ healthcare profes￾sional, displaying the virtues of selflessness, altruism, professionalism and commitment to \n\n【26】her work.\n\n【27】Others may argue that Claire has no moral obligation to be immunised. Claire is an autono￾mous individual, and thus has the right to make decisions for herself in the same way that \n\n【28】a patient would have the right to make a decision about whether or not to be immunised. \n\n【29】This is particularly relevant in the case of flu immunisations, where the evidence supporting \n\n【30】the effectiveness of immunisation is not fully established. Furthermore, the benefit of Claire \n\n【31】being immunised is predominantly experienced by patients rather than by Claire herself, and \n\n【32】so the evidence for effectiveness might have to be stronger to justify obliging her to have the \n\n【33】immunisation. Incentivising the flu vaccine may also be problematic, as this could impact \n\n【34】on Claire’s ability to make a voluntary and autonomous choice. Claire should be provided \n\n【35】with information about the risks and benefits of immunisation in an unbiased form, and her \n\n【36】consent subsequently sought.\n\n【37】An interesting comparison may be made between the flu vaccine, which is currently not \n\n【38】compulsory, and the hepatitis B virus vaccine, which is compulsory for certain healthcare \n\n【39】workers.

At the end of the day her neck felt stiff, so she intentionally “cracked” it by quickly rotating it to one side. She immediately developed weakness in her bilateral upper extremities to the point that she was unable to lift her arms off her bed. Within a few hours of onset of her symptoms she had difficulty ambulating. She developed urinary retention with no sensation of bladder fullness. This was so severe that she had over a liter of urine in her bladder that drained after a Foley catheter was placed.\n\n【3】_Before you read further, pause and start to form a hypothesis about what the exam might reveal. The history is not just about identifying the pace, but it is the start of localization. Based on the history, do you suspect this is a lesion involving the central or peripheral nervous system? If you suspect a lesion in the CNS, where might it be_ _and what findings (present or absent) might support your hypothesis? If you suspect a lesion in the PNS, what might be different? As you read the exam below, remember that our exam is informed by the history. Try to take a minute before proceeding to think about what exam maneuvers you might include (or exclude) when examining the patient_ _._\n\n【4】Her neurologic examination was notable for normal mental status and cranial nerves. Her strength was 0/5 in the bilateral proximal upper extremities (shoulder abduction, elbow flexion and extension). Her strength was 3 to 4−/5 in the distal upper extremities (wrist flexion and extension, intrinsic muscles of the hand). Her strength in the proximal lower extremities was 3 to 4−/5 (hip flexion, knee flexion and extension), and her strength was normal in the distal lower extremities. She had completely absent sensation to pinprick and temperature below her neck; however, she had preserved sensation to vibration and position. Her reflexes were diminished throughout, and her plantar response was “mute.”\n\n【5】She was initially seen at an outside hospital where she had an MRI of her brain and spine, which were normal. Due to the diagnostic uncertainty of her presentation, she was transferred to our facility for a second opinion.### What is the pace?\n\n【6】Although her symptoms continued to progress over several hours after initial onset, the symptom onset was quite rapid over seconds to minutes, which fits with a hyperacute time course of disease.### What is the localization?\n\n【7】First, we must decide whether her symptoms are attributable to a lesion in the central or peripheral nervous system. She has dissociated loss of pinprick and temperature with preservation of vibratory and position sense. Remember, these fibers travel together in the periphery via peripheral nerves to the dorsal root ganglia. Once these fibers enter the spinal cord, they split into the spinothalamic tracts (pain and temperature) and dorsal columns (vibration, proprioception, fine touch, and two-point discrimination). The spinothalamic tracts synapse and decussate soon after entering the spinal cord and ascend in the anterolateral cord, whereas the dorsal columns synapse in the dorsal root ganglia but do not decussate until they reach the medulla via the posterior cord . Since our patient has dissociation of sensory modalities, we know that the lesion cannot be in the peripheral nervous system and must be central. The dissociation of sensory modalities also localizes within the central nervous system to the spinal cord given her lack of cranial nerve abnormalities. Even though these pathways remain separate in the lower brainstem, making the brainstem a theoretical localization , the fact that her deficits are all below the neck strongly indicates the lesion is within the spinal cord.\n\n【8】Figure 6.1 The ascending and descending tracts in the spinal cord are shown in cross-section. Note the locations of the fasciculus gracilis and cuneatus (dorsal column), lateral corticospinal tract, and spinothalamic tracts.\n\n【9】This figure was published in _Neuroanatomy: an Illustrated Colour Text_ , 6th edition, Alan R. Crossman and David Neary, Page 77, Copyright Elsevier 通用删除7(英):<u>(2019)</u>.\n\n【10】Let’s follow Occam’s razor and see if we can identify one spinal cord lesion that can cause all of her symptoms. Of course, this is not always true, and a patient can have multiple lesions. She is weak bilaterally, so we know that both corticospinal tracts are involved. Given the predominant involvement of the upper extremities more so than the lower extremities, we might suspect a central cord syndrome. This is because the corticospinal tracts are organized somatotopically, with information traveling to the upper extremities found medially and information to the lower extremities traveling laterally. Usually in a central cord syndrome, the sensory deficit is a cape-like decrease of pain and temperature. This arises from dysfunction of the crossing spinothalamic fibers in the anterior white commissure at the level of the lesion. The spinothalamic fibers from levels more caudal to the lesion are only involved in much larger lesions, as they are found more laterally in the spinothalamic tract.\n\n【11】However, our patient has profound and complete loss of sensation to pain and temperature. This implicates a much larger lesion than just the central cord that extends to cover both spinothalamic tracts and most of the corticospinal tracts (medial more than lateral). The lesion would therefore need to cover most of the anterior spinal cord, but it must spare the posterior cord since vibration and position sense traveling in the dorsal columns are preserved.\n\n【12】Lastly, we know that the lesion must be in the cervical spinal cord, since it involves myotomes and dermatomes in the upper extremities.### What is the syndromic diagnosis?\n\n【13】Our patient is a 27-year-old woman who presents with a syndromic diagnosis of hyperacute onset of an anterior spinal cord syndrome.### What is the etiologic diagnosis?\n\n【14】The etiologic differential diagnosis for hyperacute neurologic syndromes in this case is essentially limited to either trauma or a vascular event. She has a history of neck manipulation (clinical context), which raises the question of a traumatic lesion. However, the initial MRI of her spine did not show any abnormalities. We would expect to see pathologies causing a compressive myelopathy, such as an epidural hematoma or ruptured disc, to be present on her MRI. Since those are absent, then a vascular etiology becomes the most likely cause of her neurologic deficits.\n\n【15】This is where our knowledge of neuroanatomy is once again important. Since we suspect a vascular event, we need to know the vascular supply to the spinal cord. The anterior spinal cord is perfused by the anterior spinal artery, which originates from the two vertebral arteries. Several small branches contribute to it along its course running down the spinal cord, the largest of which is named the artery of Adamkiewicz and typically originates in the lower thoracic cord. The anterior spinal artery perfuses the anterior two-thirds of the spinal cord, and the posterior spinal artery perfuses the posterior one-third of the spinal cord. The posterior spinal artery resembles more of an anastomotic network of small vessels rather than a single, dominant vessel like the anterior spinal artery. Because of that, it is much less at risk of hypoperfusion or infarct.\n\n【16】The territory of the spinal cord supplied by the anterior spinal artery includes both the corticospinal tracts and the spinothalamic tracts but spares the dorsal columns. Thus, our patient’s _anatomic diagnosis_ is consistent with an anterior spinal artery syndrome, and her syndromic diagnosis with hyperacute onset of symptoms points to a vascular event. Armed with the knowledge of her exam, we repeated an MRI of her cervical spine, this time with a sequence to look for stroke. This MRI confirmed the suspected _etiologic diagnosis_ . She had suffered an infarct of her anterior spinal artery.\n\n【17】Figure 6.2 MRI sagittal cervical spine ADC sequence. The _arrows_ point to an area of signal hypointensity within the anterior cervical cord consistent with acute infarction.\n\n【18】Without the formulation of our syndromic diagnosis, we never would have obtained the MRI shown in Figure 6.2 . This is a sagittal ADC sequence of the cervical spine, which is not part of a typical spine MRI protocol. The arrows on the image show the area of signal hypointensity present in the anterior cervical cord spanning C4–C5. This is the area of infarct. Note that the posterior spinal cord at that level is normal. Although the MRI is quite striking, it was merely confirmatory for a diagnosis that was made at the bedside.### Conclusion\n\n【19】The suspected _pathologic diagnosis_ of her infarct was a fibrocartilaginous embolism. The proposed mechanism is that a small embolus of material from an intervertebral disc caused by minor trauma travels through one of the smaller arteries feeding the anterior spinal artery. This embolism then becomes lodged in one of the distal branches of the anterior spinal artery that perfuses the spinal cord, leading to infarction. Since the posterior spinal artery perfuses the posterior third of the spinal cord, that part of the spinal cord is unaffected. This is a rare condition, and certain individuals might be at higher risk due to persistent intervertebral vasculature that typically involutes during development or revascularization during normal aging. Treatment is typically supportive, although some institutions will place a lumbar drain to decrease intracranial pressure by draining off CSF in an attempt to maximize perfusion pressure and increase blood flow.\n\n【20】Ultimately, she recovered full strength in her right arm and lower extremities. However, her left arm remained weak. She had persistent severe neuropathic pain as well as bowel and bladder dysfunction. This degree of motor recovery is expected based on her score on the ASIA (American Spinal Injury Association) Impairment Scale, which is a standardized exam to assess motor and sensory dysfunction after spinal cord injury. This scale can be used to predict long-term recovery of neurologic function.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

What are the treatment options?\n\n【7】Answer 85\n\n【8】i. Angiokeratomas are vascular lesions that result from the dilation of superficial vessels. They are usually well-circumscribed and can have variable levels of hyperkeratosis. There are five variants of angiokeratomas: solitary or multiple angiokeratomas, angiokeratomas of the scrotum or vulva (also known as angiokeratoma of Fordyce), angiokeratoma corporis diffusum, angiokeratoma of Mibelli and angiokeratoma circumscriptum. This patient presents with angiokeratoma circumscriptum, which typically develops in infancy or childhood and favours the trunk, arms or legs in a unilateral distribution. This variant differs from the other types of angiokeratomas because it can be the result of a lymphatic capillary or capillary malformation, whereas all other variants of angiokeratomas represent an ectatic dilation of pre-existing vessels in the papillary dermis.\n\n【9】Solitary or multiple angiokeratomas present as small, warty, black papules that favour the lower extremities but can occur anywhere on the body. Clinically, they can be confused with melanoma due to the dark colour. Angiokeratomas of Fordyce are characterized by multiple red, purple or black papules arising along superficial vessels on the vulva or scrotum. These are typically seen in older age groups, but can be observed as early as the second decade. Vulvar lesions are associated with oral contraceptive use and increased venous pressure during pregnancy. Angiokeratoma corporis diffusum is characterized by the development of multiple angiokeratomas on the body, often in a bathing suit distribution. Angiokeratomas of Mibelli usually occur on the dorsal and lateral aspects of the hands and feet, and are associated with chilblains and acrocyanosis.\n\n【10】ii. Angiokeratoma corporis diffusum usually develops during late childhood or adolescence and presents as clusters of angiokeratomas on the trunk and bathing suit distribution. It can be linked with multiple inherited metabolic disorders but is most commonly associated with Fabry disease, an X-linked recessive disease caused by a deficiency in the lysosomal enzyme α-galactosidase A. Other associated disorders include aspartylglycosaminuria (deficiency in aspartylglycosaminidase), GM1 gangliosidosis (deficiency in β-galactosidase), fucosidosis (deficiency in α-fucosidase) and sialidosis (deficiency in sialidase).\n\n【11】iii. Angiokeratomas are benign and do not require removal. However, if patients request removal for cosmetic purposes, surgical options include laser therapy, cryotherapy, electrocautery and excision, depending on the location and size of the lesions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Understand the approach to rate control versus rhythm control of atrial fibrillation.\n\n4\\. Understand the role of antithrombotic therapy in both the acute and chronic management of atrial fibrillation.This individual is a 70-year-old man of fairly high function， who is brought into the emergency department because of dyspnea and palpitations. The initial approach should begin with ABCs and an assessment of any life-threatening concerns. Upon arrival， this patient should get an IV and be placed on cardiac and pulse oxim-etry monitors. The history and physical examination should focus on the patient’s cardiac and pulmonary status. His pulse and the rhythm on the cardiac monitor will both reveal an irregular tachycardia， which should prompt an immediate ECG. The ECG shows an irregularly irregular tachycardia consistent with the diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response (RVR).| Table3-1· DISEASES ASSOCIATED WITH ATRIAL FIBRILLATION  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Cardiac  | Hypertension (approximately 80% of cases)， coronary artery disease，cardiomyopathy， valvular heart disease， rheumatic heart disease， con-genital heart disease， myocardial infarction， pericarditis， myocarditis  |\n| Pulmonary  | Pulmonary embolism， chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)，obstructive sleep apnea  |\n| Systemic disease  | Hyperthyroidism， obesity， metabolic syndrome， inflammation  |\n| Postoperative  | Cardiac surgery， any surgery  |\n| Binge alcohol drinking  | “Holiday heart syndrome”  |\n| Lone AF  | Approximately 10% of AF 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>  |\n\n【10】anticoagulation， and odds of recurrent AF In all patients， a search for the underly-ing etiology should be undertaken because AF is often best managed by treating the underlying cause of the rhythm rather than the rhythm itself .AF affects 1% of the general population and is the most common treatable arrhyth-mia seen in the emergency department. The prevalence of AF increases with age. In adults younger than 55 years old the prevalence is only 0.1%， whereas in adults greater than 80 years old the prevalence is greater than 10%. AF is more common in men than in women and more common in whites than in blacks. Among patients with AF， 80% have cardiovascular disease， most commonly hypertension， coro-nary artery disease (CAD)， and cardiomyopathy. The remaining common underly-ing causes include pulmonary diseases such as pulmonary embolism， COPD， and obstructive sleep apnea and systemic diseases such as hyperthyroidism， obesity， and diabetes. The exception is lone AF which is a term used to describe AF in patients\n\n【11】younger than 60 years old who have no evidence of heart disease. However， increas-ingly the term “lone AF\" has been falling out of favor because it does not have a standardized， universally-accepted definition .It is theorized that AF is caused by a complex interaction between triggers for AF and abnormal atrial myocardium that has multiple reentrant circuits or automatic foci outside the sinoatrial (SA) node. This interplay leads to rapid electrical activity in the atria， which produces disorganized and ineffective atrial contractions. The rapid atrial electrical activity is also conducted through the atrioventriular(AV) node leading to an irregular ventricular response. The ventricular rate， which is usually around 100 to 160， depends on the AV node’s ability to conduct the atrial depolarization and to recover from the previous conduction. On ECG， AF looks like an irregularly irregular， usually narrow-complex， tachcycardia without associ-ated p waves.\n\n【12】AF has a number of clinical implications， most importantly cardiomyopathy and thromboembolization. Acutely， the loss of the “atrial kick” leads to a reduc-tion in cardiac output (CO) by as much as 15%. Together with the rapid ventricu-lar response shortening the diastolic filling time， CO may be significantly reduced， especially in those with already poor left ventricular function. This reduction in CO can result in hypotension and symptoms of heart failure including dyspnea and fatigue. Over the long term， AF causes progressive structural and elctrophysiologic changes in the atria that promote recurrent episodes of AF. Additionally， chronic low levels of tachycardia lead to global cardiomyopathy， which in turn predisposes to more AF For this reason it is said that AF “begets\"more AFThe management of AF is challenging because AF， rather than being a disease unto itself， is often a symptom of underlying cardiac， pulmonary， endocrine， or toxicologi-cal pathology. Successful management begins by initially addressing the patient’s overall clinical status， searching for treatable contributing factors， controlling the rate， and preventing thromboembolism .\n\n【13】In stable patients with AF， the treatment options include rate control and/or rhythm control， with or without anticoagulation. In the acute setting such as the emergency department， ventricular rate control is the single most important goal of therapy. Slowing the ventricular response to AF has a number of positive hemo-dynamic effects including increasing diastolic filling time， improving stroke volume and cardiac output， and stabilizing blood pressure. Drugs used to control the ven-tricular rate work by slowing conduction through the AV node .Figure 3-2. Algorithm for management of atrial fibrillation.\n\n【14】There are two groups of patients with AF who should not receive rate con-trolling agents： 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> unstable patients in whom the instability is presumed to be caused by the rhythm， 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. Patients who are hemodynamically unstable should get immediate electrical cardioversion to restore sinus rhythm. Patients with WPW should not receive any AV nodal blocking agents since they can lead to accelerated conduc-tion down the accessory pathway and potentially induce ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest. Patients with WPW and AF should instead get either pharmacologic or electrical cardioversion depending on their hemodynamic stability.In order to cardiovert AF several issues must first be addressed： the need for antico-agulation and the timing and method of cardioversion. During AF， uncoordinated atrial contractions lead to intra-atrial thrombus formation. The longer the duration of AF the greater is the likelihood of clot formation. Following cardioversion， the period of“atrial stunning”can also lead to thrombogenesis. Without anti-coagulation 4% to 5% of patients will have a thromboembolic event in the first\n\n| **Table 3-2·THERAPIES FOR RATE CONTROL OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION**  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Medication**  | **Mechanism Of Action**  | **Comment**  |\n| **Calcium channel** **blockers** **(verapamil，** **diltiazem)**  | **Slow AV node** **conduction by blockingcalcium channels**  | **Very effective** **Diltiazem carries the lowest risk of** **hypotension because it has least negativeinotropic effect**  |\n| **β-blockers (meto-prolol， propranolol，esmolol， atenolol)**  | **Slow AV node** **conduction by decreas-ing sympathetic tone**  | **Very effective** **More negative inotropic effect than diltiazemand carry a greater risk for hypotension** **particularly in patients with borderline low** **blood pressure or poor LV function**  |\n| **Digoxin**  | **Slows AV node conduc-tion by increasing** **parasympathetic tone** **via the vagus nerve**  | **Limited role in the ED because of its slowonset of action， long half-life， and ineffective-ness at rate control in the typical highsympathetic tone ED patient** **Has a role in rate control in sedentary patientsor those with chronic CHF**  |\n| **Amiodarone，** **(oral or IV** **Dronedarone** **(oral only)**  | **Antiarrhythmics that** **have some beta-blockingactivity**  | **Less effective than the pure rate control agentslisted above** **If cardioversion is the goal， these drugs maybe a single-agent approach to maintaining** **NSR and rate control**  |Figure 3-3. ECG of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome with atrial fibrillation.Many practitioners use the“48-hour rule\" to guide anticoagulation： AF of less than 48 hours duration does not generally require acute anticoagulation except when the patient has mitral valve disease， severe left ventricle dysfunction， or prior history of embolic stroke. Several recent studies have shown that it is both safe and cost-effective for patients with an uncomplicated clinical status who present to the emergency department with AF for less than 48 hours to be cardioverted and dis-charged directly from the emergency room.\n\n【16】Conversely， patients presenting with AF of greater than 48 hours duration should be anticoagulated prior to cardioversion. The two main approaches for pre-cardioversion anticoagulation are warfarin (Coumadin) or the combination of heparin/enoxaparin (LMWH) plus a screening transesophageal echocardiography(TEE). The conventional approach is to give warfarin therapy with an INR goal of 2 to 3 for 3 to 4 weeks before cardioversion. The alternative approach is quicker and consists of doing a TEE and， if no clot is seen， administering heparin or enoxa-parin and proceeding immediately to cardioversion . In both approaches， warfarin therapy (with and INR of 2-3) must be continued for at least 3 to 4 weeks post-cardioversion in order to prevent new clot formation during the “atrial stun-ning window.” Both approaches reduce the risk of thromboembolism to less than1% over 8 weeks.\n\n【17】The two methods of cardioversion are direct current (DC) cardioversion and pharmacologic cardioversion， with DC cardioversion being the more effective approach . The risk of thromboembolism is similar， regard-less of which method is chosen. The likelihood of a successful cardioversion for either method depends on the characteristics of the patient， the etiology of the AF， and， most importantly， the duration of the AF. New-onset AF will spontane-ously convert in about 70% of cases， whereas cases of AF with a longer duration and\n\n| **Table 3-3。ANTICOAGULATION APPROACHES FOR CARDIOVERSION**  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Conventional Warfarin**  | **TEE plus Heparin/Enoxaparin**  |\n| **Pre-cardioversion**  | **Warfarin for 3-4 wk**  | **If no clot on TEE， administer heparin orenoxaparin and proceed with immediate** **cardioversion**  |\n| **Post-cardioversion**  | **Warfarin for 3-4 wk**  | **Warfarin for 3-4wk**  |\n| **Advantages**  | **Withstood the “test of time”**  | **Shortens period of anticoagulation，reducing the risk of bleeding** **complications** **Reduces the time in AF， increasing the** **chance of successful conversion to sinusrhythm**  |\n| **Disadvantages**  | **Prolongs period of** **anticoagulation** **Delays cardioversion**  | **Has no definitive guidelines** **Requires a highly trained physician and** **expensive equipment to perform TEE**  |\n\n| **Table 3-4·DC CARDIOVERSION**  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Preparation**  | **Ⅳ， O。 cardiac and pulse oximetry monitors-following standardprocedural sedation protocols， advanced cardiac life support/airwaymaterial ready and available**  |\n| **Synchronized DCCardioversion**  | **100-360J (most patients require ≥200 J)， for AF <24 h： start with 100j；biphasic conversion offers a better success rate and fewer complicationsand achieves conversion at 50% of monophasic levels**  |\n| **Success rate**  | **75%-93%**  |\n| **Complications**  | **15% have complications including： bradycardia， ventricular tachycardia，ventricular stunning with hypotension**  |\n\n【20】dilated atria may prove refractory to all attempts at cardioversion.

The patients most likely to have recurrent AF are those with hyper-tension， an enlarged left atrium， heart failure， or AF for more than a year. It is generally thought that the risks of toxicity and proarrhythmic effects of antiarrhyth-mic therapy after cardioversion outweigh the benefits， especially in patients with no prior episodes of AF.

This morning his mother noticed he felt warm to the touch and discovered an axillary temperature of 101°F. No other signs or symptoms of infection including runny nose， cough， difficulty breathing， rash， nuchal rigidity， seizure activity， abdominal distension， vomiting， or diarrhea. She states her son has been breast-feeding less than normal， but overall has had a normal number of wet diapers. She is very concerned because this is her first child and he has never had a fever before.\n\n【1】On examination， the child is found to have a heart rate of 180 beats per minute， a blood pressure of 90/50 mm Hg， a respiratory rate of 40 breaths per minute， an oxygen saturation of 99% on room air， and a rectal temperature of 102.7°F. He is overall well appearing and has an unremarkable physical examination. Although he cries when you perform the examination， his mother is able to console him easily.\n\n【2】What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【3】What is the next step in management?\n\n【4】What is the best therapy?\n\n【5】**ANSWERS TO CASE 28：**\n\n【6】**Fever Without a Source in the 1-to 3-Month-Old Infant**\n\n【7】Summary： A previously healthy 10-week-old infant is brought in by his mother for fever The cause of the fever is not clearly identified by the history or physical exami-nation. His vital signs in the emergency department are significant for fever and tachycardia. His examination is unremarkable.\n\n【8】Most likely diagnosis： Fever without a source (FWS).\n\n【9】Next step： Order CBC， blood cultures， urinalysis， urine culture. You may also order stool studies， a chest x-ray， and perform a lumbar puncture depending on the clinical presentation.\n\n【10】Best therapy： It is up to physician discretion to decide which well-appearing infants with fever without a source should receive antibiotics. If antibiotics are given， the best drug is ceftriaxone， either IV or IM.\n\n【11】**ANALYSIS**\n\n【12】_Objectives_\n\n【13】1\\. Understand the appropriate workup for fever without a source in the well-appearing1-to 3-month-old infant.\n\n【14】2\\. Appreciate the controversy regarding the management of fever without a source in this age group.\n\n【15】3\\. Learn the treatment options for fever without a source in a 1- to 3-month-old infant.\n\n【16】**_Considerations_**\n\n【17】This 10-week-old infant presented with fever without any other signs or symptoms of infection including runny nose， cough， difficulty breathing， rash， nuchal rigidity， seizure activity， abdominal distension， vomiting， or diarrhea. Importantly， the emer-gency physician must be aware that the 1- to 3-month-old infant will not manifest the same signs of infection as an older child. For this reason， the workup of fever in this age group must remain broad and one must have a low threshold for both further testing and treatment with antibiotics.\n\n【18】**APPROACH TO：**\n\n【19】**Fever Without a Source in the 1- to 3-Month-Old Infant**\n\n【20】**DEFINITIONS**\n\n【21】FEVER WITHOUT A SOURCE： Fever without a source is an acute febrile illness in which the etiology of the fever is not apparent after a careful history and physical examination. A rectal temperature greater than 38℃ (100.4°F) is defined as a fever. SERIOUS BACTERIAL ILLNESS (SBI)： Illnesses including bacteremia， pneu-monia， urinary tract infection， skin and soft tissue infections， bone and joint infec-tions， enteritis， or meningitis due to a bacterial pathogen.\n\n【22】_Diagnosis of Potential Fever in the 1- to 3-Month-Old Infant_\n\n【23】While many parents will bring in their infants for a chief complaint of fever， not all parents will have actually taken their child's temperature with a thermometer. If an infant has had a rectal temperature more than 38°℃ at home but is afebrile and well appearing in the emergency department， this infant still requires full workup for fever. If the parent only reports a tactile fever and the infant is afebrile and well appearing in the emergency department， no laboratory testing for fever workup is required. Temperature must be measured with a rectal thermometer in order to rule out a fever. Axillary and tympanic membrane thermometers are not adequate to evaluate for fever in an infant. If an infant is brought in bundled and has a mildly elevated temperature， it is worthwhile to recheck a rectal temperature 15 minutes after unbundling the infant. However， a temperature more than 38.5℃ should never be attributed to bundling.\n\n【24】_Evaluation of Fever Without a Source in the 1-to3-Month-Old Infant_\n\n【25】The evaluation of fever in this age group has changed dramatically in the last30 years in the wake of vaccines targeting haemophilus influenzae type b and Strep-tococcus pneumoniae. These vaccines have dramatically decreased the burden of SBI in this age group. Prior to the development of these vaccines， the majority of febrile infants in this age group were hospitalized and often started on empiric antibiotic therapy. Morbidity and mortality for SBI was high and early clinical identification was very difficult.\n\n【26】Given the controversy and difficulties identifying infants with SBI several deci-sion rules have been developed. These are the Rochester， Boston， and Philadelphia criteria， each using a combination of factors including history， physical examina-tion， and laboratory parameters to identify low-risk infants. Although all these cri-teria use slightly different testing strategies， all of the criteria support the use of CBC， blood cultures， urinalysis， and urine culture to identify infants at low risk for SBI. Test results suggestive of high risk for SBI include WBC greater than or equal to 15，000/mm’or less than or equal to 5000/mm， a band-to-neutrophil ratio of greater than or equal to 0.2， a urine dipstick test positive for nitrite or leukocyte\n\n【27】esterase， or a finding of greater than or equal to 5 WBCs/hpf or organisms seen on Gram stain.\n\n【28】Routinely obtaining chest x-rays and lumbar punctures in this age group are somewhat more controversial. Although there is disagreement between the decision rules， one meta-analysis ofa combined group of 361 febrile infants found that infants which have tachypnea >50 breaths per minute， rales， ronchi， retractions， wheezing， coryza， grunting， stridor， nasal flaring， or cough should have a chest x-ray.\n\n【29】Similar to chest x-ray， routine lumbar puncture is another area of controversy among the decision rules. Several observational studies suggest that infants can be identified as low risk for SBI without performing a lumbar puncture. However， other physicians feel that the significant morbidity and mortality associated with bacterial meningitis outweighs the low incidence of the disease， and thus argue in support of routine lumbar puncture in the workup of fever without a source. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with greater than or equal to 8 WBC/mm'or organisms on Gram stain is considered high risk for SBI. Additionally， sending stool for WBCs and culture is recommended for infants in this age group with diarrhea. Greater than 5 WBC/hpf in the stool specimen is considered high risk for SBI.\n\n【30】While this case has focused on the well-appearing 1-to 3-month-old infant with fever without a source， it is worthwhile to note that ill-appearing infants in this age group have a much higher risk of SBI， and all of these infants should be treated with empiric antibiotics and admitted to the hospital. Up to 45% of these infants will test positive for SBI.\n\n【31】_Pathogens_\n\n【32】Routine vaccinations with Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (Hib) and hep-tavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) have dramatically decreased the rates of SBI infants. After the introduction of the Hib vaccine， the majority (90%) of infections were due to pneumococcus. The PCV7 vaccine further changed the landscape of SBI， decreasing the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease 65%to 80% in children younger than 3 years of age. Although much less common， other pathogens are emerging as prominent causes of SBI in this age group， including _E Coli， Staphylococcus aureus， Neisseria meningitides， Salmonella species， and Strepto-_ coccus pyogenes. Furthermore， non-vaccine serotypes of S Pneumoniae are noted to be increasingly prevalent in this age group.\n\n【33】**_Ireatment_**\n\n【34】Antibiotics must be considered for all 1- to 3-month-old infants with fever without a source. The empiric antibiotic of choice is c eftriaxone， which may be given IV or IM. The regular dose is 50 mg/kg； however， if meningitis is suspected， the dose should be increased to 100 mg/kg. If lumbar puncture is not performed， antibiotics should be withheld because giving empiric antibiotics in this situation could mask the presenta-tion of bacterial meningitis on follow-up examination. For ill-appearing infants in this age group， consideration should be given to augmenting empiric ceftriaxone by add-ing vancomycin to cover for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Streptococcus pneumonia resistant to ceftriaxone. Ampicillin should also be considered for the ill-appearing infant to cover for possible Listeria monocytogenes.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

His heart rate is 115/min, respiratory rate is 24/min, and blood pressure is 140/80 mm Hg in both arms. Lung examination shows decreased breath sounds and decreased fremitus on the right with hyperresonance to percussion. Which of the following would most likely be seen on this patient’s x-ray of the chest?\n\n【1】> (A) A widened mediastinum\n\n【2】> (B) Barrel chest and flattened diaphragm\n\n【3】> (C) Consolidation in the right lower lobe\n\n【4】> (D) Contralateral deviation of the trachea\n\n【5】> (E) Tracheal deviation to the ipsilateral side; elevated diaphragm on the right side\n\n【6】 **Answer**: The correct answer is E. This patient is most likely suffering from a spontaneous pneumothorax. Caused by the rupture of a small apical bleb on the surface of the lung, spontaneous pneumothoraces typically present in tall young men. The patient usually has sudden pain and dyspnea. Examination will show decreased breath sounds and hyperresonance on the affected side. X-ray of the chest shows overexpansion of the rib cage and an elevated hemidiaphragm on the affected side. This paradoxical abdominal motion occurs because of the negative intrathoracic pressure that causes the fatigued diaphragm to be pulled into the thorax on the right side. Spontaneous pneumothorax is treated by inserting a chest tube to remove the air from the pleural space.  \n\n【7】Answer A is incorrect. Aortic dissection, not a pneumothorax, would show up on x-ray of the chest as a widened mediastinum. Aortic dissection can occur in trauma, or a dissecting aortic aneurysm can occur in connective tissue diseases such as Marfan disease. The physical findings are not consistent with aortic dissection: first, the chest would not be hyperresonant to percussion and second, the blood pressure would not be equal in both arms.  \n\n【8】Answer B is incorrect. Barrel chests and flattened diaphragms are seen in patients with obstructive lung diseases such as chronic emphysema. Although emphysema is caused by smoking, this patient does not have a long enough smoking history. It is possible that this man could have emphysema due to an α1 \\-antitrypsin deficiency, but in that case it would not present this acutely.  \n\n【9】Answer C is incorrect. Consolidation of the right lower lobe on x-ray of the chest usually means pneumonia. The patient would present with fever, productive cough, and a high WBC count. Physical exam would show decreased resonance on the affected side and increased fremitus.  \n\n【10】Answer D is incorrect. In tension pneumothorax, a flap-like pleural tear allows air to enter into the pleural cavity, but prevents its exit. It can be caused by penetrating trauma to the chest resulting in increased pleural cavity pressure. Clinical findings include sudden onset of severe dyspnea, tympanitic percussion, and absent breath sounds. There is tracheal deviation and mediastinal structure deviation to the contralateral side. If tension pneumothorax occurs on the left side, there would be compression of venous return to the heart. Treatment of tension pneumothorax is emergent needle decompression into the pleural cavity to relieve the pressure.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

He has an unremarkable physical examination.

Understand how the different classes of lipid-lowering agents affect lipid levels and the potential side effects of those agents.\n\n【19】4\\. Know the secondary causes of hyperlipidemia.\n\n【20】##### _Considerations_\n\n【21】A young man presents to the clinic for a checkup and is found to have markedly elevated total cholesterol (normal <200 mg/dL) and LDL levels (normal <100 mg/dL), and low HDL levels (normal >45 mg/dL). He does not have any apparent secondary causes of dyslipidemia, and has no signs or symptoms of vascular disease. He does have a strong family history of hypercholesterolemia and premature death caused by myocardial infarction (MI). The decisions regarding the method and intensity of lipid-lowering therapy are based on one’s estimation of the patient’s 10-year risk of major coronary events. Because of his very high lipid levels and family history, he is a high-risk patient and, thus, should be counseled about lipid-lowering medical therapy. The very high cholesterol levels at a young age in the absence of secondary causes leads one to suspect familial hypercholesterolemia, a condition caused by defective or absent LDL surface receptors and subsequent inability to metabolize LDL particles. Meanwhile, the importance of lifestyle modification cannot be overemphasized.\n\n【22】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【23】#### Hyperlipidemia\n\n【24】#### DEFINITIONS\n\n【25】HYPERLIPIDEMIA: An excess of fats or lipids in the blood, principally due to either elevated cholesterol or triglycerides.\n\n【26】ATHEROSCLEROSIS: Deposition of atheromatous plaques containing cholesterol and lipids on the innermost layer of the walls of large- and medium-sized arteries.\n\n【27】STATIN MEDICATIONS: A class of agents that lower cholesterol by inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, which is a key enzyme in cholesterol synthesis.\n\n【28】#### CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【29】Atherosclerotic coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death of both men and women in the United States. Because of the association of hypercholesterolemia and development of atherosclerotic heart disease, most authorities recommend routine screening of average-risk individuals at least every 5 years. Clinical laboratories usually measure total cholesterol, HDL, and triglycerides. The LDL cholesterol may be calculated by using the formula:\n\n【30】A fasting sample should be measured, if possible, but the total cholesterol and HDL are still reliable in a nonfasting sample. The triglycerides and the calculated LDL levels are affected by recent dietary intake and should be drawn in the fasting state.\n\n【31】Approximately 25% of American adults have a total cholesterol level of more than 240 mg/dL, which is considered elevated according to the guidelines of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP). Management of patients with hypercholesterolemia involves assessment of other atherosclerotic risks to estimate the 10-year risk of coronary events, such as fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction. The LDL goal is set based on the estimated cardiovascular risk as described in the 2002 Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III).\n\n【32】High-risk patients already have an established CHD or other atherosclerotic vascular disease : their 10-year risk for future coronary events is more than 20% . The presence of diabetes now is considered a “CHD risk equivalent” in patients because of their higher risk of vascular disease as well as higher mortality rate from myocardial infarction than is the case with nondiabetics. High-risk individuals have an LDL goal of less than 100 mg/dL according to the ATP III. The intensity of lipid lowering for secondary prevention of CHD in patients with established atherosclerosis is controversial and is evolving. Based on additional studies published after the ATP III, some authors have proposed lower targets (LDL <70 mg/dL) for patients in the very-high-risk category: those with established CHD _plus_ multiple major risk factors such as diabetes _or_ severe and poorly controlled risk factors such as continued smoking, _or_ a recent acute coronary event.\n\n【33】The LDL goal for individuals who do not have established CHD or CHD equivalents (diabetes or other vascular disease such as stroke, peripheral vascular disease, or abdominal aortic aneurysm) is based on a risk stratification process. First, the number of risk factors for CHD is counted . The absolute 10-year risk for patients with two or more risk factors may be estimated using a scoring system based on data from the Framingham heart study . Patients with multiple risk factors then are assigned to high risk (>20%), intermediate risk (10%-20%), or low risk (<10%). Those in the intermediate-risk category should have an LDL goal of less than 130 mg/dL, whereas the lowest-risk patients have an LDL goal of less than 160 mg/dL.\n\n【34】Table 46–1 • CHD RISK FACTORS\n\n【35】Cigarette smoking\n\n【36】Hypertension (elevated blood pressure when seen, or patient on antihypertensives)\n\n【37】Low HDL cholesterol (<40 mg/dL)\n\n【38】Family history of premature coronary artery disease (in men <55 y or in women <65 y)\n\n【39】Age of the patient (men >45 y, women >55 y)\n\n【40】Diabetes mellitus\n\n【41】One should exclude a _secondary_ cause of lipid disorder , either by clinical or laboratory evaluation. The most common underlying causes of dyslipidemia are hypothyroidism and diabetes mellitus . Other conditions to consider are obstructive liver disease, chronic renal failure/nephrotic syndrome, and medication side effects (progestins, anabolic steroids, corticosteroids). Very-high-cholesterol levels in young patients in the absence of secondary causes suggest familial hypercholesterolemia, a condition caused by defective or absent LDL surface receptors and subsequent inability to metabolize LDL particles. Homozygotes for this condition may develop atherosclerotic disease in childhood and usually require intensive lipid-lowering drug therapy.\n\n【42】Figure 46–1. Risk stratification for coronary heart disease and LDL goals based on CHD risk factors.\n\n【43】Lowering serum cholesterol levels decrease the risk of major coronary events and death in hypercholesterolemic patients without a prior history of CHD (primary prevention) , as well as reducing the overall mortality and coronary disease mortality in patients who have established cardiovascular disease (secondary prevention). All patients should first be educated regarding therapeutic lifestyle changes. These changes include a diet low in saturated fat (<7% of total daily calories) and low in cholesterol (<200 mg/d), as well as exercise, which can help to lower cholesterol.\n\n【44】When lifestyle modifications are not enough to reach the LDL goal, multiple lipid-lowering medications are available. Table 46–2 lists their effects on lipids and their potential side effects. Statins are generally very well tolerated, but the most common side effect is myopathy , which may manifest as muscle tenderness with elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels. Low-grade myalgias occur in <10% of patients, but severe myopathy is reported in 0.5% of statin-treated patients. Less commonly, elevated liver enzymes , or even severe hepatitis, have been reported. When these drugs are used, routine clinical or laboratory monitoring for these effects is advisable. After initiating statins, LDL cholesterol should be checked after 6 weeks, and every 6 to 12 months thereafter, or as the clinical situation dictates.\n\n【45】Table 46–2 • DRUGS FOR HYPERLIPIDEMIA\n\n【46】####", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Glucose is freely filtered at the glomerulus and, in healthy individuals, is completely reabsorbed in the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT). However, as the filtered load of glucose increases, the reabsorption ability of the nephron is eventually saturated, and glucose begins to be excreted in the urine. Due to significant variability in nephron physiology, certain nephrons are saturated at lower filtered loads than others. Thus, between 200 and 375 mg/dL glucose begins to appear in the urine, but not all nephrons are saturated. Above 375 mg/dL, all nephrons’ transport maxima are reached, and any additional glucose is excreted in the urine.  \n\n【8】Answer A is incorrect . Glomerular filtration is never saturated because it does not depend on carrier-mediated transport. Furthermore, even if glucose were being incompletely filtered, this would tend to decrease (not increase) urine glucose levels.  \n\n【9】Answer C is incorrect . To whatever extent possible, the kidney attempts to fully reabsorb glucose in the proximal tubule. Thus, it is never secreted in the PCT.  \n\n【10】Answer D is incorrect .

Metabolic acidosis is seen on the arterial blood gas. A thiocyanate level is in the toxic range.\n\n【9】• Diagnosis: Cyanide poisoning from toxic dose of nitroprusside.\n\n【10】• Biochemical mechanism: Cyanide inhibits mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase, blocking electron transport, and preventing oxygen utilization. Lactic acidosis results secondary to anaerobic metabolism.\n\n【11】• Treatment: Supportive therapy, gastrointestinal decontamination, oxygen, and antidotal therapy with amyl nitrite, sodium nitrite, and sodium thiosulfate.\n\n【12】### CLINICAL CORRELATION\n\n【13】Hypertensive emergencies are defined as episodes of severely elevated blood pressure, such as systolic levels of 220 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressures exceeding 120 mm Hg _with_ patient symptoms of end-organ dysfunction. These symptoms may include severe headache, neurologic deficits, chest pain, or heart failure symptoms. Hypertensive emergencies require immediate lowering of the blood pressure to lower (but not necessarily to normal) levels. In contrast, hypertensive urgencies are circumstances of markedly elevated blood pressures in the absence of patient symptoms; lowering the blood pressure over 24 to 48 hours is reasonable in these cases.\n\n【14】One hazard of abruptly lowering the blood pressure is causing hypotension and subsequent ischemia to the brain or heart. In other words, the very treatment designed to prevent end-organ disease may cause the problem. To avoid precipitous hypotension, agents that induce a smooth fall in blood pressure are preferable, such as sodium nitroprusside, a titratable intravenous agent used for malignant hypertension. Its desirable properties include the ability to precisely increase or decrease the infusion to affect the blood pressure. One side effect of sodium nitroprusside is that its metabolite is thiocyanate, and with prolonged use, cyanide poisoning may result, which inhibits the electron transport chain. Thus, in clinical practice, short-term nitroprusside is used, or serum thiocyanate levels are drawn.\n\n【15】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【16】#### Electron Transport System and Cyanide\n\n【17】### OBJECTIVES\n\n【18】1\\. Know about the function of the electron transport chain (ETC).\n\n【19】2\\. Understand what factors may inhibit the ETC.\n\n【20】3\\. Be familiar with the biochemical process by which the therapy for cyanide poisoning works.\n\n【21】4\\. Recognize other ETC sites and agents of inhibition.\n\n【22】### DEFINITIONS\n\n【23】OXIDATIVE PHOSPHORYLATION: The mitochondrial process whereby electrons from NADH or reduced flavin bound in enzymes are transferred down the electron transport chain to oxygen forming water and providing energy through the formation of an hydrogen ion gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The hydrogen ion gradient is used to drive the formation of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate (P <sub>i </sub> ). This process is also called _coupled oxidative phosphorylation_ to emphasize that ATP formation from ADP and P <sub>i </sub> is coupled to and linked with electron transport such that inhibition of one also inhibits the other.\n\n【24】HYDROGEN ION GRADIENT: A situation developed across the inner mitochondrial membrane wherein the concentration of hydrogen ions outside the mitochondrion is higher than the concentration inside. Hydrogen ions are extruded from the mitochondrion by the transfer of electrons from complex I to coenzyme Q, from coenzyme Q to complex III, and from complex III to complex IV. The gradient is discharged by ATP synthase, which admits hydrogen ions into the mitochondrion thereby driving the phosphorylation of ADP by P <sub>i </sub> .\n\n【25】ELECTRON TRANSPORT CHAIN: Present in the mitochondrial membrane, this linear array of redox active electron carriers consists of NADH dehydrogenase, coenzyme Q, cytochrome c reductase, cytochrome c, and cytochrome oxidase as well as ancillary iron sulfur proteins. The electron carriers are arrayed in order of decreasing reduction potential such that the last carrier has the most positive reduction potential and transfers electrons to oxygen.\n\n【26】REDUCTION POTENTIAL: The tendency of an electron carrier to give up electrons, stated in electron volts, is called reduction potential. In any reduction–oxidation reaction electrons flow from the species with the more negative reduction potential to the more positive reduction potential.\n\n【27】CYTOCHROME: A heme (protoporphyrin IX) containing electron transfer protein. Some heme moieties are covalently attached to the protein components (cytochrome c), whereas others have isoprenoid side chains (cytochromes a and a <sub>3 </sub> ).\n\n【28】IRON SULFUR PROTEINS: These carry 1 electron and contain centers that chelate iron with organic and inorganic sulfur. Some centers contain a single iron atom chelated by 4 cysteine sulfurs; others contain 2 iron atoms chelated through 4 cysteine sulfurs and 2 inorganic sulfurs; yet others contain 4 iron atoms chelated by 4 cysteine sulfurs and 4 inorganic sulfurs.\n\n【29】COENZYME Q (UBIQUINONE): A 2 electron accepting quinone that can accept and transfer 1 electron at a time allowing it to exist in a semiquinone state as well as the fully oxidized quinone or fully reduced dihydroxy state. It is bound to multiple isoprenoid units (ubiquinone has ten units), allowing it to bind to the membrane.\n\n【30】FLAVIN MONONUCLEOTIDE (FMN): An isoalloxazine ring bound to ribosyl monophosphate in an N-glycosidic bond. FMN can accept 2 electrons or donate 1 at a time to another electron acceptor.\n\n【31】FLAVIN ADENINE DINUCLEOTIDE (FAD): An isoalloxazine ring bound to ribosyl monophosphate in an N-glycosidic bond, which is attached to adenosine monophosphate. Like FMN, FAD can accept or donate 2 electrons 1 at a time to another electron acceptor.\n\n【32】### DISCUSSION\n\n【33】The ETC or electron transport system (ETS) is located on the inner membrane of the mitochondrion and is responsible for the harnessing of free energy released as electrons travel from more reduced (more negative reduction potential,  ) to more oxidized (more positive  ) carriers to drive the phosphorylation of ADP to ATP . Complex I accepts a pair of electrons from NADH (  = -0.32 V)and passes the electron pair through the intervening carriers to complex IV , which passes the electrons to 1 atom of molecular oxygen (  = + 0.82 V) to form water with hydrogen ions (H <sup>+ </sup> ) from the medium.\n\n【34】Figure 16-1. Schematic diagram of electron transport chain ATP synthase and ATP/ADP translocase.\n\n【35】The transport of electrons through the carriers is highly coupled to the formation of ATP from ADP and P <sub>i </sub> through the formation and relaxation of the proton gradient formed across the inner mitochondrial membrane by electron transport . Each time electrons are transported between complexes I and III , between complexes III and IV , or between complex IV and oxygen, protons are extruded from the mitochondrial matrix across the inner membrane to the intermembrane space/cytosol. (The outer membrane poses no barrier to proton passage.) In other words, the energy gained from these electron transfers is used to pump protons from the mitochondrial matrix side to the cytosol side. Because the mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to protons, there is a gradient that develops with a higher concentration of protons outside the matrix. The protons then come through the ATP synthase complex through proton pores, and, as they come back into the mitochondrial matrix, ADP is phosphorylated to ATP. Thus, because the process of electron transport is tightly coupled to ADP phosphorylation, ADP must be present for electron transport to proceed, and therefore the ADP/ATP translocase must be able to exchange a molecule of ADP in the cytosol for a molecule of ATP (newly made) in the matrix of the mitochondria. When these various processes operate in concert the mitochondria are said to exhibit coupled respiration.\n\n【36】The components of the electron transport chain have various cofactors. Complex I, NADH dehydrogenase, contains a flavin cofactor and iron sulfur centers, whereas complex III, cytochrome reductase, contains cytochromes b and c <sub>1 </sub> . Complex IV, cytochrome oxidase, which transfers electrons to oxygen, contains copper ions as well as cytochromes a and a <sub>3 </sub> . The general structure of the cytochrome cofactors is shown in Figure 16-2 . Each of the cytochromes has a heme cofactor, but they vary slightly. The b-type cytochromes have protoporphyrin IX, which is identical to the heme in hemoglobin. The c-type cytochromes are covalently bound to cysteine residue 10 in the protein. The a-type cytochromes have a long isoprenoid \\[(CH <sub>2 </sub> –CH = C(CH <sub>3 </sub> )–CH <sub>2 </sub> ) <sub>n </sub> \\] tail bound at one side-chain position.\n\n【37】Figure 16-2. Heme active center of cytochromes a, b, and c components of electron transport chain.\n\n【38】Inhibition of the electron transport chain in coupled mitochondria can occur at any of the 3 constituent functional processes; electron transport per se, formation of ATP, or antiport translocation of ADP/ATP . The best known inhibitor of the ADP/ATP translocase is atractyloside in the presence of which no ADP for phosphorylation is transported across the inner membrane to the ATP synthase and no ATP is transported out. In the absence of ADP phosphorylation the proton gradient is not reduced allowing other protons to be extruded into the intermembrane space because of the elevated \\[H <sup>+ </sup> \\], and, thus, electron transfer is halted. Likewise the antibiotic oligomycin directly inhibits the ATP synthase, causing a cessation of ATP formation, buildup of protons in the intermembrane space, and a halt in electron transfer. Similarly, a blockade of complex I, III, or IV that inhibits electron flow down the chain to O <sub>2 </sub> would also stop both ATP formation and ADP/ATP translocation across the inner mitochondrial membrane.\n\n【39】Table 16-1 • RESPIRATORY CHAIN SITES AND INHIBITORS\n\n【40】Cyanide ion (CN通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>– </sup></u> ) is a potent inhibitor of complex IV, the cytochrome c oxidase component of the electron transport system in the oxidized state of the heme (Fe通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>3 </sup></u> <sup>+ </sup> ). It can be delivered to tissue electron transport systems as a dissolved gas after breathing HCN or ingested as a salt such as KCN or as a medication leading to the formation of CN通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>– </sup></u> such as nitroprusside. CN通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>– </sup></u> competes effectively with oxygen for binding to cytochrome c oxidase at the oxygen-binding site. Cyanide binding—and therefore, cyanide poisoning—is reversible if treated properly and early. The treatment strategy depends on dissociation of cyanide from cytochrome a/a <sub>3 </sub> (Fe通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>3 </sup></u> <sup>+ </sup> ). Increasing the percentage of oxygen breathed will increase the competition of oxygen over cyanide for the cytochrome a/a <sub>3 </sub> (Fe <sup>3+ </sup> ). Two other medications foster this competition. Nitrite ion (NO <sub>2 </sub>通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>– </sup></u> ) is administered to convert some oxyhemoglobin \\[HbO <sub>2 </sub> (Fe通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>2 </sup></u> <sup>+ </sup> )\\] to methemoglobin \\[met-HbOH(Fe通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>3 </sup></u> <sup>+ </sup> )\\], another competitor for cyanide binding . The cyanide adduct of methemoglobin is formed releasing cytochrome oxidase in the Fe通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>3 </sup></u> <sup>+ </sup> form ready to bind oxygen and disinhibit the electron transport chain. To remove the cyanide adduct in a nontoxic fashion, thiosulfate ion is administered. The mitochondrial enzyme rhodanese catalyzes the conversion of cyanide and thiosulfate to thiocyanate and sulfite. Thiocyanate is incapable of inhibiting cytochrome oxidase and is excreted. The methemoglobin can be reconverted to oxyhemoglobin by NADH and methemoglobin reductase.\n\n【41】Figure 16-3. Strategy for reversal of cyanide binding to cytochrome oxidase (cyt a/a <sub>3 </sub> Fe <sup>3+ </sup> ).\n\n【42】Other sites of the electron transport chain can be targets of inhibitors based on similarity in structure to enzyme components or to substrates of the various components. For instance, the fish poison rotenone resembles the isoalloxazine ring of the FMN cofactor of complex I, the NADH CoQ reductase. Rotenone binds the enzyme quite avidly and prevents transfer of electrons from NADH to coenzyme Q through the iron sulfur centers and thus inhibits oxidation of NADH and subsequent reduction of oxygen to water. By contrast, carbon monoxide resembles molecular oxygen and binds with a higher affinity than oxygen to complex IV, the cytochrome oxidase component, inhibiting transfer of electrons to oxygen.\n\n【43】###", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

She is asymptomatic and is not taking any medications. Her blood pressure is found to be 135/85 mm Hg on two readings. Review of her chart reveals that her blood pressure was 133/84 mm Hg on a visit 4 months ago for a urinary tract infection. Which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding her blood pressure?\n\n【1】A. Her blood pressure is normal and she is at average risk for developing hypertension.\n\n【2】B. She has prehypertension and is at high risk for developing hypertension.\n\n【3】C. She has stage 1 hypertension and should be started on a thiazide diuretic.\n\n【4】D. She has stage 2 hypertension and should be started on multidrug therapy.\n\n【5】**Answer**: 30.1 B. This patient’s blood pressure falls in the prehypertensive range. She is at increased risk for developing hypertension and may benefit from the institution of lifestyle modifications to try to reduce her risk of progression.\n\n【6】**Question**: 30.2 A 66-year-old woman has an average blood pressure of 150/70 mm Hg despite appropriate lifestyle modification efforts. Her only other medical problems are osteoporosis and mild depression. Her last lipid panel revealed a total cholesterol of 160 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) 40 mg/dL, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) 90 mg/dL. Which of the following would be the most appropriate treatment at this time?\n\n【7】A. Lisinopril (Prinivil, Zestril)\n\n【8】B. Propranolol (Inderal)\n\n【9】C. Amlodipine (Norvasc)\n\n【10】D. Hydrochlorothiazide\n\n【11】E. Clonidine (Catapres)\n\n【12】**Answer**: 30.2 D. Randomized, placebo-controlled trials have shown that isolated systolic hypertension in the elderly responds best to diuretics, and to a lesser extent β-blockers. Diuretics are preferred, although long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers may also be used. In this case, β-blockers or clonidine may worsen the depression. Thiazide diuretics may also improve osteoporosis, and would be the most cost-effective and useful agent in this instance.\n\n【13】**Question**: 30.3 A 48-year-old type 2 diabetic man has had persistent blood pressure readings of 150/95 mm Hg for the past 6 months. Current medications include glyburide and metformin. His last HbA <sub>1c </sub> was 6.9% and the patient has a body mass index (BMI) of 24. On physical examination, position sense is intact but a peripheral neuropathy is detected in a stocking and glove pattern. Vibratory sensation is decreased bilaterally on both lower extremities. Eye examination shows mild papilledema but no cotton wool spots. When questioned, he says that he still occasionally sneaks a cookie after dinner and drinks alcohol nightly. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for him?\n\n【14】A. DASH diet and recheck blood pressure in 3 months\n\n【15】B. Thiazide diuretic alone\n\n【16】C. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor alone\n\n【17】D. Combination of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and thiazide diuretic\n\n【18】**Answer**: 30.3 D. This patient’s blood pressure goal is less than 130/80 mm Hg. He is greater than 20/10 mm Hg above this goal, so a combination of medications is the most appropriate initial therapy regardless of BMI or HbA <sub>1c </sub> . Refractoriness for 6 months symbolizes that he is past the point of management with diet and exercise.\n\n【19】**Question**: 30.4 At a routine checkup a 6-year-old boy is found to have a blood pressure of 130/90 mm Hg. Repeated blood pressure readings are consistently elevated. The child was delivered at 36 weeks by normal spontaneous vaginal delivery with no complications. All major milestones were met on time and he currently is enrolled in first grade. The child has been healthy up until this point. Which of the following is the most appropriate diagnosis and therapeutic step?\n\n【20】A. The child has essential hypertension and should be started on the DASH diet.\n\n【21】B. The child most likely has hyperthyroidism and should be started on a β-blocker while thyroid studies are performed.\n\n【22】C. The child most likely has renal parenchymal disease and should have a urinalysis and renal ultrasound ordered.\n\n【23】D. The child most likely has “white coat” hypertension and the readings should be ignored if there is no family history of hypertension.\n\n【24】E. The child most likely has a pheochromocytoma and should start a 24-hour urine collection for metanephrines.\n**Answer**: 30.4 C. Essential hypertension is rarely found in children less than 10 years of age and should be a diagnosis of exclusion. The most common cause of hypertension is renal parenchymal disease, and a urinalysis, urine culture, and renal ultrasonography should be ordered for all children presenting with hypertension.\n\n【25】CLINICAL PEARLS\n\n【26】 Check every adult patient’s blood pressure at every office visit.\n\n【27】 Thiazide diuretics should be the first-line drug treatment in almost all cases of hypertension. There should be a compelling reason to use another agent before a thiazide.\n\n【28】 All patients with hypertension are at risk for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. Be sure to address their other significant risks for these diseases, including lipids, smoking, diabetes, and obesity.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

This condition primarily affects young African American men, aged 20–40 years. The cause of DCS is not well understood but it is thought to be partially caused by hyperkeratosis leading to follicular occlusion. The initial presentation of DCS is commonly one or more papules or pustules at the vertex of the scalp. When left untreated, these pustules develop into boggy nodules that form sinus tracts to other lesions. Patients often report flares of symptoms with itching, pain, and foul odor being common complaints. As the disease progresses, patients may notice hair loss at the side of nodules. Microscopy may be helpful in distinguishing DCS from other diseases of the scalp. The histopathology of DCS will vary with stage. In earlier stages, lesions demonstrate dense neutrophilic predominance with associated lymphocytic, histiocytic, and plasmacytic infiltrates. As the inflammation progresses to a more chronic state, lesions contain granulomas consisting of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and foreign-body giant cells. Treatment options also depend on the stage of the disease and range from antibiotics and scalp hygiene, steroids, isotretinoin, immune modulators, and in extreme cases, scalp resection. Patients will require counseling on the psychosocial aspects as well as the relapsing and remitting nature of the disease.\n\n【14】Keywords\n\n【15】Dissecting cellulitis Cicatricial alopecia Follicular occlusion Staphylococcus aureus HLA-B27\n\n【16】A 44-year-old male presented with boggy, painful lesions on the central and posterior scalp. He complained that some of the areas would drain at times and that the hair stopped growing in those areas. He also reported low back and hip pain but assumed it was arthritis from working as a firefighter. Of note, his history was positive for acne as a teenager and a pilonidal cyst in his twenties that was treated surgically.\n\n【17】On physical examination, scarring alopecia was present on the central and posterior scalp with nodules that would drain with pressure . Keloidal scarring was present. The eyebrows and eyelashes were of normal density. The fingernails were normal.

The most affected group are young African American men, aged 20–40 years, but the disease has been reported in women and other racial groups as well 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. It is hypothesized that hormones may play a role in the disease process due to the presentation of the disease on the vertex of the scalp in young men. Additionally, there is some evidence of DCS among families, proposing a potential genetic predisposition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【34】The initial presentation of DCS is commonly one or more papules or pustules at the vertex of the scalp. Left untreated, these pustules develop into boggy nodules that form sinus tracts to other lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Patients often report flares of symptoms with itching, pain, and foul odor being common complaints. As the disease progresses, patients may notice hair loss at the side of nodules. The cause of DCS is not well understood but it is thought to be partially caused by hyperkeratosis leading to follicular occlusion. This pressure can lead to rupture, chronic inflammation, and secondary bacterial infection. The most commonly implicated bacteria in secondary infections are _Staphylococcus aureus_ species and treatment should be appropriately tailored.\n\n【35】Three other diseases follow similar pathology and are collectively referred to as the follicular occlusion tetrad: hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), acne conglobata (AC), pilonidal sinus, and DCS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The pathophysiology of these conditions is believed to be caused by follicular keratosis and occlusion in apocrine-bearing areas, leading to the characteristic painful and malodorous inflammatory nodules and abscesses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. As the follicles rupture and re-epithelialize, fistulas and draining sinus tracts can form 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The chronic, relapsing, and remitting nature of the tetrad predisposes affected individuals to the development of secondary bacterial infection, disfiguring scars, and subsequent cicatricial alopecia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The symptom complex shares these characteristics and diagnosis remains largely clinical, highlighting the importance of distinguishing the follicular occlusion tetrad from other inflammatory disorders. When the lesions are found in intertriginous areas, it is classified as hidradenitis suppurativa. When on the face, shoulders, arms, or thighs it is termed acne conglobata. Lesions in the gluteal cleft are pilonidal disease and of the scalp, DCS. Microscopy may help distinguish DCS from other diseases of the scalp. The histopathology of DCS will vary with stage. In earlier stages, lesions demonstrate dense neutrophilic predominance with associated lymphocytic, histiocytic, and plasmacytic infiltrates. As the inflammation progresses to a more chronic state, lesions contain granulomas consisting of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and foreign-body giant cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Given the similarity in disease pathology, it is estimated that up to one-third of patients with DCS have concomitant hidradenitis suppurativa or acne conglobata.\n\n【36】Further, studies have demonstrated that these patients are at an increased risk of developing an HLA-B27-negative spondylopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Joint pain usually presents after the onset of cutaneous findings with the waxing and waning nature of DCS, HS, and AC flares. The association between DCS and inflammatory arthritis is poorly understood but current literature suggests a potential hypersensitivity to sebum, skin antigens, or bacterial antigens as the inciting factor. This hypothesis is further supported by positive ANA and symptom improvement after corticosteroids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. DCS may present with other inflammatory disorders including arthritis, keratitis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and Crohn’s disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Potential complications of untreated or recalcitrant disease include osteomyelitis and metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, necessitating thorough, regular evaluation and treatment in all patients presenting with progressive DCS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【37】Oftentimes, a diagnosis of DCS is made based on clinical features alone. However, exudative cultures are recommended to rule out co-existing bacterial or fungal infections. In indeterminate cases, dermoscopy presents a useful diagnostic tool. Early disease is characterized by visualization of empty follicular openings with yellow and black dots versus end-stage disease where confluent white areas without follicular openings are present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Lastly, a punch biopsy of a boggy or actively inflamed nodule may provide useful diagnostic information prior to the initiation of treatment.\n\n【38】Treatment\n---------\n\n【39】Treatment of DCS can be difficult as there is no established gold standard and cases often become refractory over time. The goals of therapy are to prevent follicular occlusion, reduce inflammation, and decrease the risk of developing secondary infections. For all patients, appropriate counseling on the relapsing and remitting nature of the disease is paramount. Particular attention should be paid to the psychosocial implications, as many patients seek initial evaluation out of concern for foul odor and alopecia. Currently, there is no agreed upon staging scale for DCS.\n\n【40】Clinicians can best stratify their patients’ disease based on the number and size of lesions, amount of drainage, and scarring present at the time of diagnosis. In mild cases, treatment options include a combination of scalp hygiene, topical antiseptics, topical or oral antibiotics, incision and drainage, and corticosteroid injections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Scalp hygiene, including benzoyl peroxide wash, chlorhexidine, or other antimicrobial soaps, are reasonable first treatments. Steroid treatment can include intralesional triamcinolone 10–40 mg/cc or oral prednisone 40–60 mg/day 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The dosing of triamcinolone should be tailored to the degree of inflammation; high doses may be beneficial in the treatment of keloidal scarring.\n\n【41】Given that the majority of DCS lesions are colonized by _S. aureus_ , treatment should be tailored with adequate antimicrobial coverage. The preferred first-line oral antibiotics are ciprofloxacin 250–500 mg BID or combination clindamycin 300 mg twice daily and rifampin 300 mg twice daily, with recommended use for at least three months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Additional agents include tetracyclines and TMP-SMX. If alternative colonization is expected, exudative cultures are recommended prior to initiation of antibiotics.\n\n【42】Oral isotretinoin presents another option and is frequently used in more severe cases or when the aforementioned agents have failed. A meta-analysis by Guo et al. showed that oral isotretinoin is an effective treatment for improving symptoms of the disease, however, 24% of patients experienced symptom recurrence after discontinuation of therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>.\n\n【43】Alternatively, 5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy (ALA-PDT) has demonstrated promising results as a non-invasive and safe therapy for DCS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Photodynamic therapy acts by using a drug as a photosensitizer to destroy affected tissue when activated by visible light 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. However, patients should be appropriately counseled prior to initiating therapy, as ALA-PDT has not demonstrated the ability to promote hair regrowth.\n\n【44】Given its recent success in the treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa, the use of TNF-α inhibitors can be employed in severe DCS as well. Adalimumab specifically has been shown not only to have efficacy in severe cases of DCS, but also to stimulate hair regrowth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. While these agents provide varying levels of improvement, a certain subset of patients may experience refractory symptoms necessitating surgical excision. Both staged excision of sinus tracts and scalpectomy with split-thickness grafting have been reported with good success 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 17 \\]</u>. Patients should be counseled on the permanent nature of hair loss after scalpectomy and offered psychosocial support if needed.\n\n【45】Key Points\n----------\n\n【46】*   Dissecting cellulitis of the scalp (DCS) is a rare condition characterized by boggy nodules and draining sinuses that can lead to permanent scarring and hair loss.\n\n【47】*   The pathophysiology of DCS is incompletely understood but thought to be related to follicular occlusion and secondary bacterial infection leading to sinus tract formation.\n\n【48】*   A variety of treatments are available for DCS with varying efficacy. Antibiotics and isotretinoin are first-line agents, but new advances in treatment include photodynamic therapy and immune modulators.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The chest pain was not associated with suffocation \n\n【5】or choking sensation and did not radiate to the arms. But the pain worsened when \n\n【6】the patient took a deep breath and it hurt to cough or sneeze. About five days back, \n\n【7】he had a “flu-like” illness with low grade fever, aches and pains along with dry cough. \n\n【8】There was no history of purulence in sputum, hemoptysis or wheeze. He smoked \n\n【9】5 cigarettes a day, consumed about a litre of beer over the week-end, but denied \n\n【10】abusing any illicit drug. There was no history of premature coronary artery disease in \n\n【11】his family. He also denied any history of sore-throat with joint pains during childhood \n\n【12】and he had not undergone any recent dental or endoscopic procedure. \n\n【13】On examination, the patient was in obvious discomfort and preferred to sit up \n\n【14】in bed and lean forward. The pulse rate was 110 beats/min. regular, with a BP of \n\n【15】110/70 mm Hg and the temperature was 100.60\n\n【16】 F. At the neck, JVP was not raised, \n\n【17】thyroid gland was normal and there were no palpable lymph nodes. There were \n\n【18】also no erythematous areas, skin nodules, petechial spots or swollen joints. Throat \n\n【19】examination revealed mild pharyngeal congestion, but there were no pustules over \n\n【20】the tonsils. On inspection, the precordium was quiet and the apex beat normally \n\n【21】located. Upon auscultation, a high-pitched scratchy sound was audible all over \n\n【22】the precordium. The lung fields were clear without any rhonchi or crepts. The ECG \n\n【23】showed sinus tachycardia and narrow QRS complexes, with elevation of the S-T \n\n【24】segment in most leads (except aVR) and depression of the P-R segment \n\n【25】Figure 24.1: ECG showing sinus tachycardia with concave S-T elevation110 Section 7 Pericardial Infections\n\n【26】Table 24.1: Causes of S-T segment elevation \n\n【27】•  Myocardial infarction\n\n【28】•  Prinzmetal angina\n\n【29】•  Ventricular aneurysm\n\n【30】•  Dressler’s syndrome\n\n【31】•  Acute viral pericarditis\n\n【32】•  Early repolarization variant\n\n【33】CLINICAL DISCUSSION \n\n【34】When a patient presents with a short febrile illness, clinical signs of heart disease \n\n【35】and some ECG abnormalities, possibilities that need to be considered are \n\n【36】rheumatic fever, infective endocarditis, acute myocarditis and acute pericarditis. \n\n【37】Rheumatic fever generally presents with a migratory polyarthritis, with or without \n\n【38】cutaneous nodules or an evanescent skin rash. Infective endocarditis generally \n\n【39】follows a dental or surgical procedure with a pre-existing valvular disease or a \n\n【40】septal defect. Acute myocarditis is characterized by myocardial dysfunction \n\n【41】and clinical signs of heart failure. Our patient presented with chest pain, had \n\n【42】an audible pericardial rub and the ECG showed elevation of the S-T segment. \n\n【43】Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is acute pericarditis. \n\n【44】The chest pain of acute pericarditis is sharp in character and central in \n\n【45】location. Therefore, it resembles the chest pain of myocardial infarction, but lacks \n\n【46】the characteristic radiation and accompaniments of ischemic chest pain. The \n\n【47】pain increases on deep breathing and coughing and therefore, patients prefer \n\n【48】shallow respiration. The pain also worsens on lying supine and hence, the patient \n\n【49】prefers to sit and lean forward. \n\n【50】The pericardial friction rub is a high-pitched, scratchy or squeaky sound, \n\n【51】audible over the precordium along the lower left sternal border. It is better audible \n\n【52】during inspiration, with the patient sitting up and leaning forward. Occasionally, \n\n【53】the rub is accompanied by a palpable thrill, especially in patients with uremic \n\n【54】pericarditis. The classical pericardial rub is triphasic and has three components, \n\n【55】each related to a discrete phase of the cardiac cycle. Accordingly, there is a \n\n【56】presystolic rub during atrial systole and a systolic and diastolic component \n\n【57】related to ventricular systole and diastole respectively. Sometimes, the rub is a \n\n【58】one-component or two-component sound, if there is associated atrial fibrillation \n\n【59】or ventricular dysfunction. Sometimes the rub is evanescent and changes its \n\n【60】quality on a day-to-day basis. \n\n【61】The most common and significant cause of S-T segment elevation on the ECG \n\n【62】is coronary artery disease. S-T elevation occurs in acute myocardial infarction \n\n【63】and in coronary vasospasm (Prinzmetal’s angina). In patients with prior \n\n【64】myocardial infarction, reasons for S-T segment elevation are Dressler’s syndrome \n\n【65】and ventricular aneurysm. S-T elevation also occurs in the early repolarization \n\n【66】variant in which case the clinical profile is entirely normal . The S-T Case 24 Acute Pericarditis 111\n\n【67】Table 24.2: ECG features of acute pericarditis\n\n【68】•  S-T segment elevation is concave upwards\n\n【69】•  S-T elevation is observed in nearly all leads\n\n【70】•  T waves invert after S-T returns to base-line\n\n【71】•  Q waves do not appear with ST-T changes\n\n【72】•  R wave height is maintained in chest leads\n\n【73】•  P-R segment is depressed in the limb leads\n\n【74】•  Reciprocal S-T segment depression not seen\n\n【75】•  Sinus tachycardia is almost invariably present\n\n【76】•  Arrhythmias and conduction defects are unusual\n\n【77】•  ECG changes do not evolve but resolve rapidly\n\n【78】segment elevation of acute pericarditis can be differentiated from that of acute \n\n【79】myocardial infarction by several ECG features such as concave upward shape and \n\n【80】concomitant depression of the P-R segment . \n\n【81】PERTINENT INVESTIGATIONS \n\n【82】In patients with chest pain, the most frequently requested test after ECG is \n\n【83】cardiac troponin-T. Troponin may be elevated in upto 50% of patients with acute \n\n【84】pericarditis, thus limiting its diagnostic value. The total leucocyte count (TLC) and \n\n【85】C-reactive protein (CRP) level may be elevated in acute pericarditis. A four-fold \n\n【86】rise in antiviral antibody titre may occur, but is not diagnostic and often futile in the \n\n【87】absence of specific antiviral therapy. Anti-streptolysin O (ASLO) titre and throat \n\n【88】swab culture for beta-hemolytic Streptococcus are appropriate, if rheumatic fever \n\n【89】is suspected. Suitable blood cultures are obtained, if the possibility of infective \n\n【90】endocarditis is being entertained. In acute pericarditis, ECHO is useful to identify \n\n【91】pericardial effusion and features suggestive of associated myocarditis. Usually, \n\n【92】only a small rim of effusion is present and the left ventricular systolic function \n\n【93】is normal. In myo-pericarditis, the ventricular function is mildly impaired but is \n\n【94】generally reversible.\n\n【95】MANAGEMENT ISSUES \n\n【96】Treatment of acute pericarditis should first be targeted against a specific cause, if \n\n【97】there is one. Examples include withdrawal of the offending drug in drug-induced \n\n【98】pericarditis, hemadialysis for uremic pericarditis, thyroid hormone replacement \n\n【99】for myxedema and suitable chemotherapy in malignant disease . \n\n【100】In most cases, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are first-line \n\n【101】treatment, in the absence of a specific cause. In post-infarction Dressler’s \n\n【102】syndrome, aspirin is preferable over other NSAIDs. It is given in high-doses to \n\n【103】begin with, to be tapered down over a period of time. Concomitant use of a proton \n\n【104】pump inhibitor is recommended to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. 112 Section 7 Pericardial Infections\n\n【105】Colchicine may be used along with a NSAID in refractory and recurrent cases \n\n【106】or alone if NSAIDs are contraindicated. Steroids should only be considered in \n\n【107】the context of a systemic inflammatory disease. Steroids should not be used in \n\n【108】bacterial or tubercular infection since they cause immunosuppression and in \n\n【109】post-MI patients, as they interfere with scar formation. Pericardiocentesis and \n\n【110】pericardectomy are rarely required in the treatment of acute pericarditis. \n\n【111】Table 24.3: Causes of acute pericarditis \n\n【112】•  Infective: viral, bacterial, tubercular\n\n【113】•  Traumatic: accidental, cardiac surgery\n\n【114】•  Malignant: metastasis, radiotherapy\n\n【115】•  Autoimmune: rheumatoid arthritis, SLE\n\n【116】•  Metabolic: uremia and myxedema\n\n【117】•  Drug-induced: procainamide, hydrallizine\n\n【118】•  Infarction: post-MI Dressler’s syndromeCASE", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

There, the mass was diagnosed and treated as an abscess using surgical debridement, saline irrigation, and antibiotics. When the mass recurred, a biopsy was obtained and submitted for histopathologic examination. The iguana was referred for treatment options.\n\n【7】Despite the large mass on his leg, the iguana exhibited normal behavior and activity at home. He had been eating, drinking, and defecating normally. Review of his care revealed excellent husbandry conditions at home. The diet consisted of a variety of fresh vegetables such as yellow squash, zucchini, apples, sweet potatoes, carrots, spinach, spring mix lettuce, peas, green beans, bok choy, and cabbage and dandelions. The lizard was housed in a habitat that provided the recommended captive environmental requirements for the species.﻿\n\n【8】Physical Examination Findings\n\n【9】The iguana was bright, alert, and responsive. He weighed 4.2 kg and was in good body condition. There were no other abnormalities noted aside from the mass on his left rear limb. The mass was located on the ventral aspect of his thigh and appeared to be associated with one or more of the femoral pores. It was approximately 4 cm in diameter and ulcerated .﻿\n\n【10】Other Diagnostic Information\n\n【11】Blood was drawn from the caudal vein using the lateral approach and submitted for a complete blood count (CBC) and diagnostic profile .\n\n【12】Radiographs that were taken 3 months prior to presentation accompanied the patient .\n\n【13】The mass was surgically removed on the day of admission into the veterinary hospital. Anesthetic induction was provided by intravenous propofol (10 mg/kg) and maintained using isoflurane following intubation (2.0 mm tube).\n\n【14】During surgery, a sterile marking pen was used to determine the appropriate surgical margins that would allow tissue apposition once the mass was excised. A number 15 blade was used to incise the skin around the mass in order to make a fusiform-shaped defect. The mass was superficial to the underlying musculature and was well encapsulated. Metzenbaum scissors and electrocautery were used to excise the mass within the capsule. The one large vessel entering the proximal aspect of the mass was occluded with hemoclips and transected. Careful dissection around the mass was completed, and the mass was successfully removed within its capsule . Prior to placing the mass in 10% neutral buffered formalin for histology, an imprint was made from the freshly cut surface for cytodiagnosis . The skin was closed in two layers. The subcutaneous layer was closed using 3-0 glycomer 631 suture, with a few simple interrupted tension sutures followed by a more superficial simple continuous pattern. The skin layer was closed using 3-0 nylon suture using a horizontal mattress pattern. The lizard recovered from anesthesia and surgery without complications .\n\n【15】Fig. 69.1 .

The plasma biochemistry profile revealed hypoglycemia, hypoproteinemia, hypoalbuminemia, hypophos-phatemia, hypocholesterolemia, hyponatremia, and hypochloremia. Explanation for these findings in an otherwise healthy-appearing iguana was challenging. It is possible that the published reference values used do not represent reference values that might have been obtained from the laboratory used to analyze the plasma sample. These findings may have resulted from anorexia owing to long transport associated with recent travel to the veterinary hospital. Lymphatic fluid dilution of the plasma sample would be another possible explanation; however, this was not supported by the CBC findings performed on the same blood sample. The hyperkalemia does not fit with the last two explanations, and if true, suggests either excessive intake of potassium, acidosis, or decreased urinary excretion of potassium. Repeat examination of these plasma analytes would be in order.\n\n【21】Table 69.2 .

The cells exhibit anisokaryosis, nuclear pleomorphism, multinucleation, and nuclear chromatin clumping. Some of the cells have cytoplasmic basophilia and perinuclear vacuolation.

The histology confirmed a squamous cell carcinoma. Neoplastic cells extended to within 2 mm of the inked margin of the mass, indicating that the mass was completely removed. The cytology in this case was somewhat academic because the histology of the biopsy obtained by the referring veterinarian had already identified the neoplasia.

Skin biopsy with histopathology \n\n【22】and immunophenotyping should help to clarify the diagnosis. \n\n【23】This patient was diagnosed with cutaneous B-cell lymphoma, CBCL (a primary cutaneous\n\n【24】follicle centre cell lymphoma). CBCL develops when a clonal proliferation of B lym￾phocytes is confined to the skin. Primary cutaneous lymphomas of the B-cell type \n\n【25】comprise approximately 20 per cent of cutaneous lymphomas. Other types of CBCL \n\n【26】include primary cutaneous marginal zone, primary cutaneous large B-cell, leg type, and \n\n【27】primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphomas.\n\n【28】Follicle centre cell lymphomas are clinically characterized as asymptomatic nodules, \n\n【29】plaques or tumours. CBCL lesions are slow-growing, usually red to plum in colour and \n\n【30】are firm with a smooth surface. Common sites include the trunk, scalp and forehead. \n\n【31】Primary CBCL needs to be differentiated from a secondary cutaneous lymphoma, which \n\n【32】is where a nodal follicular lymphoma has metastasized to involve the skin. This can be \n\n【33】differentiated by molecular techniques to demonstrate a lack of the t (14;18) chromo￾somal translocation.\n\n【34】For solitary lesions or small groups, the treatment of choice is local radiotherapy.

Others included leukocytosis and significantly elevated CRP.\n\n【18】Differential diagnosis of suppurative meningitis should be considered. Supporting points were based on: the patient got fever, rash, and lethargy. Physical examination suggested suspected positive Babinski signs. WBC and CRP were significantly high after IV antibiotics treatment. The first CSF test showed increase in cell numbers mainly in NE. However, the fact that CSF was clear, sugar and chlorine levels were normal, and the bacterial culture test showed negative results in blood and CSF, did not support a possible meningitis.\n\n【19】### 3.2.5 Case Specific Clinic Features\n\n【20】1.  1.\n\n【21】    The child was always sleepy when she was admitted in our hospital.

Antibiotics and glucocorticoids were used in the treatment for one week. At the same time, diarrhea occurred, and fungal infection could not be excluded. Considering a large dose of IVIG had been used, it was not suitable to test 1-3-β-D glucan, so oral fluconazole for 3 days was given to the patient for experimental treatment, and it had a nice effect.\n\n【28】5.  5.\n\n【29】    When the patient was admitted in hospital, the inflammatory reaction was severe.

The patient denies feeling depressed but insists he will hurt himself if he is not admitted to a hospital immediately. He has vague suicidal plans and says he will find some ways to kill himself but cannot be more specific. He has no prior history of psychiatric treatment or complaints， no medical problems， and is not taking any medication. He drinks one or two beers a week and denies using drugs.

Approach the patient in a nonthreatening manner， remaining neutral and avoiding abrupt confrontations or accusations of lying. Be aware of implicit countertransference reactions.

Understand how to approach a patient suspected of malingering.(EPA 4， 12)\n\n【18】**_Considerations_**\n\n【19】This man initially presents with symptoms of a psychotic disorder. Although he admits to some criteria consistent with schizophrenia， such as hallucinations and delusions， the time course is too brief for a diagnosis of schizophrenia. An important factor seems to be his upcoming military duty. He displays a surprisingly high level of insight into his \"illness，\" considering his lack of a psychiatric history. Although a psychotic disorder should be considered， the patient's reluctance to provide more details， a lack of objective findings on the mental status examination， a goal-directed thought process， and his intact insight in the context of required military duty make malingering the most likely diagnosis.\n\n【20】**APPROACHTO：Malingering**\n\n【21】**DEFINITIONS**\n\n【22】COUNTERTRANSFERENCE： The conscious Or unconsciousemotional response of the therapist/ clinician to the patient-for example， an unreasonable or exaggerated sense of annoyance at this patient.\n\n【23】MALINGERING： The intentional feigning， production， or exaggeration of psychi-atric or medical signs/symptoms to obtain secondary (external) gain (eg， financial compensation； avoidance of work or criminal prosecution； to obtain drugs or avoid military service). Under certain circumstances malingering may be adaptive-for example， feigning illness when captured in war.\n\n【24】PRIMARY GAIN： Relief of tension or conflict through neurotic illness.\n\n【25】PROJECTIVE IDENTIFICATION： A defense mechanism in which an individual deals with emotional conflict or stressors by falsely attributing to another person the individual's own unacceptable feelings， impulses， or thoughts.\n\n【26】SECONDARY GAIN： Obvious advantage that a person gains from an illness， such as gifts， attention， or release from responsibility.\n\n【27】**CLINICAL APPROACH**\n\n【28】_Diagnosis and Clinical Presentation_\n\n【29】Malingering is not a psychiatric or medical diagnosis， but in the DSM-5， it is listed as another condition that may be the focus of clinical attention (a V code). Malingering is denoted by the intentional production of false or grossly exagger-ated physical or psychological symptoms motivated by external incentives (second-ary gain). The symptoms of malingering are under voluntary control. Factors that should raise the index of suspicion for malingering include a medicolegal context of presentation； marked discrepancy between claimed stress， severity， or disability and objectively observable findings； lack of cooperation with appropriate evalua-tion and treatment； and presence of antisocial personality disorder.\n\n【30】_Differential Diagnosis_\n\n【31】The primary， most essential differentiation must be made between malingering and an actual psychiatric or medical diagnosis. Presence of malingering does not pre-clude an individual from having other medical or psychiatric illnesses. Collateral information gathered from family or friends can be helpful in further elucidating the diagnosis. Important rule-outs in the differential diagnosis for malingering include both factitious and somatic symptom disorders， including conversion dis-orders. In factitious disorder， a patient intentionally produces a physical or psychi-atric illness in order to assume the sick role (primary gain). In somatic symptom disorder and conversion disorder， a patient unconsciously produces a physical or neurologic symptom because of an intrapsychic conflict. Table 60-1 illustrates these\n\n| **Table 60-1·DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS FOR MALINGERING**  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Condition**  | **Production ofSymptoms or Signs**  | **Motivation**  | **Presentation**  |\n| **Malingering**  | **Conscious**  | **External gain**  | **Psychological/physicalsigns and symptoms**  |\n| **Factitious Disorder**  | **Conscious**  | **Assumption otsick role**  | **Psychological/physicalsigns and symptoms**  |\n| **Somatic Symptom/** **Conversion Disorder**  | **Unconscious**  | **Unconscious**  | **Physical symptoms**  |\n\n【33】differences. Another example of a somatic symptom disorder is hypochondriasis illness anxiety disorder. An example of a type of factitious disorder is Munchausen disorder (factitious disorder by proxy).\n\n【34】**_ireatment_**\n\n【35】As malingering is not a psychiatric disorder， there is no specific treatment for it. However， there are several factors that can be helpful to both the clinician and the patient. An important issue to keep in mind is the clinician's own feelings(countertransference) toward malingering as well as projective identification. Accusations， anger， and rejection serve only to inflame the situation， promote further defensiveness， send the patient elsewhere， or perhaps provoke the indi-vidual to violence. Abrupt confrontations and accusations of lying should be avoided. As in all other psychiatric and medical interventions， maintenance of a therapeutic alliance is essential. Empathic exploration and understanding of the feelings and issues contributing to the feigning of illness can lead to increased trust in the clinician and truth telling by the individual. If it is practical or desired， a referral for further supportive therapy can then be made to address the underlying issues.\n\n【36】Psychological tests employing standardized psychometric instruments by trained and experienced clinical psychologists may be helpful in the diagnosis of malingering. The diagnosis of malingering remains a matter of clinical judg-ment and professional opinion. Listing the evidence suggesting malingering but not reaching a definitive conclusion might be a judicious， prudent， and parsi-monious approach unless the evidence is overwhelming and supported by clear-cut proof.\n\n| CASE CORRELATION ●See Case 30 (Factitious Disorder).  |\n| --- |", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

A decrease in pulmonary ventilation rate\n\n【2】B. Coadministration of dantrolene\n\n【3】C. Low blood and tissue solubility\n\n【4】D. Low MAC\n\n【5】**Answer**: 22.1 C. The alveolar partial pressure of an inhalation anesthetic with low blood and tissue solubility will rise quickly. Under these conditions, blood and brain will equilibrate, and anesthesia will be induced, rather quickly. An inhalation anesthetic with a low MAC will equilibrate with brain tissue rather slowly. An increase, not decrease, in pulmonary ventilation rate will increase anesthetic gas tension and the speed of induction, particularly for inhalation anesthetic agents with moderate to high blood solubility. Dantrolene is not an anesthetic agent. It is used to counter the effects of malignant hyperthermia.\n\n【6】**Question**: 22.2 An inhalation agent with a low (1.7) MAC has which of the following?\n\n【7】A. A rapid onset of action\n\n【8】B. A low blood:gas partition coefficient\n\n【9】C. A low oil:gas partition coefficient\n\n【10】D. A high potency\n\n【11】**Answer**: 22.2 D.

This involves a primary survey concerned with \n\n【25】diagnosing and treating life-threatening injuries quickly and effectively. The assessment follows \n\n【26】an ‘ABCDE’ approach:\n\n【27】• A: airway with cervical spine protection\n\n【28】• B: breathing and ventilation\n\n【29】• C: circulation with haemorrhage control\n\n【30】• D: disability – neurological status\n\n【31】• E: exposure/environmental control\n\n【32】The trauma series of x-rays are typically comprised of an AP chest x-ray, an AP pelvis x-ray and \n\n【33】a lateral C-spine x-ray. This combination of x-rays is aimed at picking up major injuries such as \n\n【34】a haemothorax or pelvic fracture.\n\n【35】When the primary survey has been completed and resuscitation has commenced, a secondary \n\n【36】survey is performed. This is a ‘head to toe’ examination to determine any other injuries.\n\n【37】In this case, the patient has sustained an ‘open’ or ‘compound’ tibial fracture. While this is not \n\n【38】life-threatening, it is important that it is dealt with promptly. The normal principles when deal￾ing with any fracture still apply, i.e. analgesia, stabilization, elevation, reduction and fixation. \n\n【39】The wound should be photographed and covered with gauze soaked in an antiseptic solution. \n\n【40】This avoids the necessity of repeated re-examinations, which would increase the risk of infec￾tion before reaching the operating theatre. Intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics should be \n\n【41】commenced as soon as possible, e.g. cefuroxime and metronidazole. Similarly, tetanus prophy￾laxis should be considered and given if necessary. Providing the patient is otherwise stable, they \n\n【42】should be taken to theatre for wound debridement and irrigation.\n\n【43】KEY POINT\n\n【44】•\tThe ATLS protocol should be followed even in the presence of obvious limb defor￾mity, to ensure a potentially life-threatening injury is not missed.191\n\n【45】EAR, NOSE AND THROAT", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

This morning， his wife found him unresponsiveand extremely agitated. Currently， the patient is flailing his limbs and is unresponsive to stimuli or toverbal commands. His pupils are equal and reactive. The patient is sedated， and a CT of the headdemonstrates a large lesion in the right frontal lobe. MRI establishes the likely diagnosis.  |\n| --- |\n| What is the differential diagnosis of a brain lesion? Neoplastic causes： ●·The most common brain tumor is a metastatic lesion (secondary tumor—lung， breast， melanoma， etc).●Primary brain tumors include gliomas， meningiomas， pituitary adenomas， vestibular schwannomas， andprimary central nervous system lymphomas. Nonneoplastic causes： · Infectious (eg， abscess， viral， progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy， toxoplasmosis， or cysticercosis).·Vascular (cerebral hemorrhage or infarct). · Inflammatory (associated with multiple sclerosis or postinfectious encephalopathy).  |\n| What is the most likely diagnosis? Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). MRI is the definitive test fora brain mass. Gliomas appear hypointense on T1-weightedimaging  and hyperintense on T2-weightedimaging. They also heterogeneously enhance with contrastand can be distinguished from the surrounding edema. Therapidity of onset of this patient’s symptoms without signs of infarct suggests a malignant process. FIGURE 8-10. Glioblastoma multiforme. (Reproduced， withpermission， from Ropper， AH， Samuels MA.

GBM is the most commonly diagnosed primary brain tumor. It is a grade IV astrocytoma that is mostcommonly found in adults， in contrast to the peak childhood prevalence of low-grade (pilocytic)astrocytoma. GBM is typically found in the cerebral hemispheres and can cross the corpus callosum toform the characteristic “butterfly glioma.\"  |\n| What are the most common signs and symptoms associated with this condition?·SSymptoms of GBM include headache (73%-86% of cases) and seizures (26%-32% of cases).●Signs of GBM include paraparesis， papilledema， confusion， and aphasia.  |\n| What is the appropriate treatment for this condition?The prognosis for GBM is poor； most patients do not survive beyond 1 year of diagnosis. The initialtreatment is resection. Adjuvant radiation therapy with chemotherapy (with nitrosoureas and temozolomide)is the current standard of care. Dexamethasone is used to alleviate the vasogenic edema that that is causedby blood-brain barrier disruption that occurs in the area around many brain tumors. Dexamethasone ispreferred over other steroids because its relative lack of mineralocorticoid activity decreases the risk offluid retention.  |", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Orthodontic bands are placed on both sides (right and left) for accommodation of maxillo-mandibular elastics to hold the teeth correctly in occlusion at night . The elastics are removed each morning upon waking up, and the patient is allowed full daytime use of the jaw with no dietary restrictions. Chewing brings energy and loading through the mandible to the fractured condyle being remodelled to the needs of function. This situation is controlled and observed closely for a minimum period of 3 months and at 3-month intervals during the next 12 months.\n\n【15】Fig. 12.6\n\n【16】Orthodontic band in upper and lower first molar\n\n【17】Fig. 12.7\n\n【18】( a ) Maxillo-mandibular elastics in place. ( b ) Upper molar band.

We control and provide immediate assistance if the occlusion begins to drift or the incisal opening begins to decrease. Jaw symmetry and occlusion are thus maintained during rehabilitation.\n\n【20】The soft tissues heal concomitantly with the condyle during jaw movement. If jaw movement is not maintained at its fuller range, the soft tissues heal (and scar) to whatever that range might be.\n\n【21】A simple technique to increase the interincisal opening and with which patient compliance is high is to use progressively stack tongue blades together and have the patient insert them between the incisal edges of the anterior teeth . A stack of 24 tongue blades placed between the teeth will produce an opening of 40 mm at the incisal edges, a minimum goal in rehabilitation. The stacked tongue blade regimen is hard to impose in this time of high technology (TheraBite), but is very effective in children.\n\n【22】Fig. 12.8\n\n【23】( a ) Tongue blades in place. ( b ) Tongue blades, lateral view\n\n【24】Most patients will initially tolerate 17–18 tongue blades stacked together, and it is not very difficult to proceed to 24 blades or more within 5- to 10-day period, and the patient keeps them available to use 4 or 5 times daily during the 3-month period of rehabilitation.\n\n【25】Fig. 12.9\n\n【26】( a ) After fifteen days of use.

There was a rehabilitation improvement as a result of persistent exercising.\n\n【35】The most cooperative and willing patients proceed up to 30 tongue blades taped together, which will produce a mouth opening beyond 45 mm at the incisal edges of the anterior teeth.\n\n【36】During multiple times of the day when the jaw opening exercise is done, the patient is also required to move the jaw from side to side actively or passively with assistance if needed and in protrusion to maintain or restore these very important excursive movements.\n\n【37】Fig. 12.13\n\n【38】Tomography after twenty four months of treatment\n\n【39】Two years after, the CT images of the TMJ area show the condylar head growing and in good position .\n\n【40】Fig. 12.14\n\n【41】( a ) After thirty four months of treatment.

Clinically, the maximum opening is wide and straight. When measured, it is 48-mm wide . Additionally, a frontal X-Ray shows that the condylar head on the right side has grown satisfactorily as to maintain symmetry respect to the middle line ; no further problems, neither pain or TMJ disorders were registered at this time. The panoramic X-Ray  also shows the good position of the right condyle.\n\n【49】Fig. 12.17\n\n【50】Idem. Maximum opening\n\n【51】Fig. 12.18\n\n【52】Idem.

( b ) Panoramic X-Ray, left side\n\n【59】There are reasons for open surgery of fractured mandibular condyles that are beyond the scope of this discussion. However, as long as there are ways to control jaw position via the occlusion or splints, non-surgical management of the problem has proven to be a predictable and reliable way to handle these fractures.\n\n【60】When analyzed by age groups, the fractures in children 10 years or younger were judged to be intracapsular; children represent a special category when younger than age 12. The condylar neck tends to be shorter, and many fractures are thus high neck with only the condyle fractured free from the mandible. Considering their healing capabilities (e.g. regeneration of a new condylar head) (Hovinga et al. 1999 ), the technical difficulty of reducing and fixing a condylar head displaced medial to the coronoid notch and the amount of soft tissue dissection required, open reduction in children younger than 12 should logically be performed infrequently.\n\n【61】Children between 12 and 18 years old still benefit from their growth potential following close reduction, but have fractures similar to adults (i.e. more low necks/ramus due to the mandibular reaching adult shape). Thus open reduction with rigid fixation and immediate function is a strong option in this age range.\n\n【62】12.2 Ankylosis\n--------------\n\n【63】Although TMJ ankylosis is one of the most common pathologies affecting the facial skeleton, it is also the most overlooked and under-managed problem in children. Ankylosis leads to reduced mandibular opening, from partial reduction to complete restriction.\n\n【64】Ankylosis in growing children affects the growth and development of the jaws and occlusion.\n\n【65】It can be defined as “inability to open the mouth due to either a fibers or bony union between the head of the condyle and the glenoid fossae” (Shashikiran et al. 2005 ).\n\n【66】Ankylosis is most commonly associated with trauma, local or systemic infection or systemic disease. The onset of incidence frequently believed to be before the age of 10.\n\n【67】Clinical features of TMJ ankylosis in childhood are:\n\n【68】*   Restricted mouth opening and its associated results including poor oral hygiene and rampant caries\n\n【69】*   Facial asymmetry\n\n【70】*   Mandibular macrognathia and bird face deformity\n\n【71】*   Class II malocclusion with posterior crossbite/anterior open bite\n\n【72】TMJ ankylosis occurring in childhood can impair mandibular growth and function, which may later produce severe facial asymmetry and mandibular retrusion. Early diagnosis of TMJ ankylosis is important, and early surgical intervention is an accepted mode of treatment (Chidzonga 1999 ). Surgery is indicated to restore mandibular opening. Early and aggressive postoperative opening of the mandible is necessary to maintain good opening.\n\n【73】The treatment of TMJ ankylosis faces a significant challenge because of technical difficulty and a high incidence of recurrence.\n\n【74】Recurrence is a major problem that occurs after the release of TMJ ankylosis.\n\n【75】At present the surgical procedures most frequently used for treatment of ankylosis are:\n\n【76】1.  1.\n\n【77】    Gap arthroplasty, in which a joint space is recreated either at the side of the pre-existing space or below it; in this case no substance is interposed between the recreated bony surfaces.\n\n【78】2.  2.\n\n【79】    Interpositional arthroplasty, which also recreates a joint space but, in addition, an autogenous temporalis muscle flap or alloplastic material, is introduced into the gap (Brusati et al. 1990 ).\n\n【80】Case 2\n\n【81】A 3-year-old child reported with the complaint of inability to open his mouth wide, deflexion of the mandible to the left and facial asymmetry . When he was examined, his mouth opening was as little as 10 mm, and there was a deviation of the mandible to the left side; he also was showing signs of retrognathism and bird face deformity.\n\n【82】Fig. 12.22\n\n【83】Initial picture. Face\n\n【84】Fig. 12.23\n\n【85】Initial picture showing deviation\n\n【86】His mother did not remember a trauma as the cause of the problem. History revealed that at the moment of his birth, his mother had a local infection; as a consequence the child developed suppurative otitis media towards the joint, which was resolved in due course of time.\n\n【87】Panoramic X-ray evaluation  and tomography  revealed deformity of condylar head and blot out of the joint space and also antegonial notching of the left mandibular ramus and a shortened ramus in comparison to the right ramus.\n\n【88】Fig. 12.24\n\n【89】Initial panoramic X-Ray.

Axial view\n\n【113】Based on all these findings, a diagnosis of TMJ ankylosis secondary to post-delivery infection was confirmed and the surgery was recommended.\n\n【114】Furthermore, the use of functional appliances  is also recommended before and after the surgery because they allow the mandible to be properly positioned to the maxilla while stimulating continuous functional movements (Kirk and Farrar 1993 ).\n\n【115】Fig. 12.36\n\n【116】Face before surgery\n\n【117】Fig. 12.37\n\n【118】Functional appliance in place\n\n【119】Fig. 12.38\n\n【120】Bionator. Lateral view\n\n【121】After complete evaluation he was derived for surgery consisting of unilateral arthroplasty with interposing temporalis muscle graft under general anaesthesia. The use of the appliance after offers comfort while haematomas are resolving and tissues are recovering. Furthermore, it provides stimulation to the muscles and favours the removal of metabolites resulting from the muscle spasms and help the mandible to keep its normal position.\n\n【122】Early stimulation and control of muscular activity is an important key in treatment; the mobilization of tissues within and around the joint frees restraints of fibrotic capsule components, and the lateral eminences increase disc mobility, reducing load concentrations. In this way we improve condylar remodelling, favour restoration of a proper function of the masticatory system and prevent mechanical restrictions originated by scarring and loss of motion.\n\n【123】In my experience, results with functional appliance therapy are more effective than those obtained with traditional physiotherapeutic exercises which are more difficult to perform for children. Such treatment is indicated not only during healing but also during the following years (at least 2) when bone regeneration and compensatory growth are to occur. In this case both the child and his parents were provided comprehensive psychological assistance before, during and after the surgical intervention. The parents were similarly motivated and encouraged to prepare their child for surgery.\n\n【124】Fig. 12.39\n\n【125】Panoramic X-Ray after surgery\n\n【126】Fig. 12.40\n\n【127】Idem.

Cardiomediastinal assessment demonstrates a right-sided aor￾tic arch. The lungs are clear and free from active disease. There is no evidence of old \n\n【24】Mycobacterium tuberculosis exposure. Bone review is normal. There is no pneumothorax \n\n【25】or evidence of free air under the diaphragm.\n\n【26】Normal aortic anatomy: The aorta is divided into the ascending thoracic aorta, arch of \n\n【27】the aorta, descending thoracic aorta and abdominal aorta. The ascending aorta begins at \n\n【28】the aortic root running superiorly and anteriorly, adjacent to the right side of the ster￾num. It is enclosed with the pulmonary trunk in a sheath of serous pericardium and is in \n\n【29】continuation with the arch of the aorta. Lying behind the manubrium of the sternum, the \n\n【30】aortic arch runs superiorly, posteriorly and from left to right anterior to the trachea. The \n\n【31】arch gives rise to the brachiocephalic artery, left carotid artery and left subclavian artery \n\n【32】as it runs across the mediastinum to become the descending thoracic aorta. This descends \n\n【33】inferiorly as a posterior mediastinal structure, piercing the diaphragm at the level of the \n\n【34】twelfth thoracic vertebra and is in continuity with the abdominal aorta.\n\n【35】A right aortic arch is an embryological variant with persistence of the right arch and right \n\n【36】descending aorta while undergoing regression of the left side. Seen in approximately 2 per \n\n【37】cent of the western population, its course within the chest is to the right of the trachea \n\n【38】and oesophagus, crossing the midline in the lower thorax to pierce the diaphragm in the \n\n【39】anatomically correct position. Its incidence increases in congenital heart disease (e.g. tetral￾ogy of Fallot), and is commonly associated with one of three aberrant vascular anomalies:\n\n【40】• Right aortic arch with aberrant left subclavian artery: This is the commonest right \n\n【41】aortic arch anomaly and is associated with cardiac septal defects and coarctation. The \n\n【42】patient is usually asymptomatic but its positioning predisposes to aortic torsion in \n\n【43】adulthood. The left carotid artery is the first branch of the aortic arch with an aberrant \n\n【44】left subclavian artery arising from the proximal descending aorta.\n\n【45】• Right aortic arch with mirror image branching: As the second commonest right aortic \n\n【46】arch anomaly, this is caused by embryological interruption of the arch between the left \n\n【47】subclavian artery and the descending aorta, most commonly just distal to the ductus arter￾iosus. The great vessels branch opposite to the anatomicial norm, and patients are often \n\n【48】symptomatic, being strongly associated with cyanotic heart disease (e.g. truncus arteriosus).\n\n【49】• Right aortic arch with isolated left subclavian artery: In this third most common scen￾ario, the aortic arch is interrupted between the left common carotid artery and the left \n\n【50】subclavian artery. The result is a left subclavian artery arising from the left pulmonary \n\n【51】artery, and the patient is symptomatic with congenital subclavian steal syndrome.\n\n【52】A right aortic arch is a normal anatomical variant. Having survived into adulthood with \n\n【53】no symptoms, it is highly unlikely that this incidental finding is of any clinical conse￾quence. The student was passed fit to travel, and had a successful year in Australia.\n\n【54】 KEY POINTS\n\n【55】• The normal aortic arch runs superiorly, posteriorly and from left to right anterior to the \n\n【56】trachea.\n\n【57】• A right-sided aortic arch is seen in 2 per cent of the population.\n\n【58】• There are often concomitant aberrant vascular anomalies with a right-sided aortic arch.275", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Pediculosis capitis is found worldwide with no limitations based upon age, sex, race, or socioeconomic class. The main route of transmission is direct head-to-head contact. Head lice are approximately 2–3 mm long parasites that feed on the human blood approximately every four to six hour. The female louse lives for 30 days, during which time she lays between five and ten eggs a day on hair shafts. Pediculosis capitis most commonly affects children between three and 11 years of age. It is characterized by the presence of excoriations, erythema and scaling on the scalp and posterior neck. Itching and burning sensation are reported. In case of secondary bacterial infection, a low-grade fever and local lymphadenopathy may occur. Diagnosis is made by the identification of nits and/or lice on the scalp hair. Viable eggs are usually tan to brown in color, while hatched eggs are clear to white. Dermoscopy may help to better visualize nits and lice. In treatment of pediculisis capitis, pyrethrins synergized with piperonyl butoxide or permethrin cream/lotion are commonly used. Benzyl alcohol lotion, dimethicone, spinosad cream rinse and ivermectin solution are also recommended. Another therapeutic option for head lice is oral ivermectin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【32】In the presented patient, tinea capitis, psoriasis and seborrheic dermatosis were included in the differential diagnosis.\n\n【33】Tinea capitis is a fungal infection of the scalp that affects mainly children.

Since the previous night, he was finding \n\n【5】it difficult to lie flat in bed and had to sit up frequently to breathe. The patient was \n\n【6】quite well until 5 days prior to his hospital visit, when he developed a “flu-like” illness. \n\n【7】The low grade fever, headache, myalgia and mild sore throat had now settled down. \n\n【8】There was no history of productive cough, chest pain or hemoptysis. There was also \n\n【9】no history of skin rash, petechial spots or painful joints. He had not undergone any \n\n【10】recent dental or endoscopic procedure. He did not suffer from recurrent pharyngo￾tonsillitis during his childhood. \n\n【11】On examination, the patient was ill-looking and tachypneic. Pulse was fast and \n\n【12】feeble and his extremities were sweaty. His heart rate was 116 beats/min with \n\n【13】a BP of 104/68 mm Hg and the temperature was 98.80\n\n【14】 F. There were no petechial \n\n【15】hemorrhages under the finger-nails or in the conjunctiva and his joints were not \n\n【16】swollen. The apex beat was displaced outwards and the S1\n\n【17】 and S2 were normal. A soft \n\n【18】S3\n\n【19】 was audible in early diastole, but there was no murmur. No pericardial friction rub \n\n【20】was heard. There were few basilar rales over the lung fields.\n\n【21】CLINICAL DISCUSSION \n\n【22】From the history and physical examination, it is obvious that the patient had a \n\n【23】short febrile illness, culminating in left ventricular dysfunction within a week. \n\n【24】ECG showed sinus tachycardia, low QRS amplitude and non-specific T wave \n\n【25】inversion. X-ray chest findings were enlarged cardiac silhouette, hilar congestion \n\n【26】, Kerley B lines and pulmonary edema. ECHO revealed a dilated left \n\n【27】ventricle with global hypokinesia . There was no abnormality of the \n\n【28】cardiac valves, septal defect or presence of pericardial effusion. \n\n【29】When a patient presents with a febrile illness and ECG abnormalities, there \n\n【30】are four main diagnostic possibilities. These are: \n\n【31】•\t Rheumatic fever\n\n【32】•\t Acute pericarditis \t \t \t\n\n【33】•\t Acute myocarditis\n\n【34】•\t Infective endocarditis.128 Section 8 Myocardial Infections\n\n【35】\t Acute pericarditis is unlikely because the patient had no chest pain or S-T\n\n【36】segment elevation on the ECG or pericardial friction rub on clinical examination. \n\n【37】Moreover, left ventricular dysfunction is unusual in pericarditis, unless there is \n\n【38】an associated component of myocarditis. Infective endocarditis is also unlikely\n\n【39】because the ECHO did not show any abnormality of the cardiac valves or presence \n\n【40】of a septal defect. Rheumatic fever is a pancarditis where myocardial dysfunction \n\n【41】is accompanied by pericarditis (friction rub) and endocarditis (inflammed \n\n【42】valve leaflets). Moreover, rheumatic fever generally presents with a migratory \n\n【43】polyarthritis with or without cutaneous nodules and an evanescent skin rash. \n\n【44】Therefore, the most probable diagnosis in this case is acute myocarditis. \n\n【45】\t Acute myocarditis is an inflammatory disease afflicting the heart muscle and\n\n【46】causing myocardial dysfunction over a short period of time. Although global\n\n【47】hypokinesia is the hallmark of myocarditis, regional wall motion abnormalities \n\n【48】can occur, if myocardial inflammation is patchy in distribution. The myocardial \n\n【49】damage and necrosis is immune-mediated and the cardiac troponin levels are \n\n【50】often elevated. The etiology is most often viral and Coxsackie B virus or Echovirus \n\n【51】Figure 28.1: X-ray showing cardiomegaly with \n\n【52】left pleural effusion\n\n【53】Figure 28.2: ECHO showing an enlarged\n\n【54】globular left ventricleCase 28 Acute Myocarditis 129\n\n【55】Table 28.1: Pathogens implicated in acute myocarditis \n\n【56】•  Viral Coxsackie B, Echovirus, HIV \n\n【57】•  Bacterial C. diphtheriae, Mycoplasma \n\n【58】•  Spirochetal Lyme’s disease, Leptospirosis \n\n【59】•  Protozoal Chaga’s disease \n\n【60】are commonly implicated. Myocarditis may be bacterial as in Mycoplasma \n\n【61】infection and Diphtheria. Rarely, it may be caused by a spirochete as in Lepto￾spirosis or protozoa as in Chaga’s disease . \n\n【62】PERTINENT INVESTIGATIONS \n\n【63】The patient of acute myocarditis must be investigated to establish the inflammatory \n\n【64】nature of the disease and the type of inflammation. The total leucocyte count \n\n【65】(TLC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) \n\n【66】helps to establish inflammation. Anti-streptolysin O (ASLO) titre and throat\n\n【67】swab culture for beta-hemolytic Streptococcus are indicated, if rheumatic fever \n\n【68】is suspected. Suitable blood cultures are obtained, if the possibility of infective \n\n【69】endocarditis is being entertained. \n\n【70】Viral serology for the diagnosis of viral myocarditis is generally unhelpful, \n\n【71】because the implicated viruses are ubiquitous in nature and antiviral drugs \n\n【72】have no role in the treatment. Endomyocardial biopsy is rarely performed \n\n【73】because of its low diagnostic yield, except in situations where a specific etiology \n\n【74】is suspected on clinical grounds and needs to be confirmed on tissue analysis. \n\n【75】These conditions are Loeffler’s endocarditis, hemochromatosis and amyloidosis.\n\n【76】Besides inflammation, electrolyte imbalance and nutritional deficiency are \n\n【77】sometimes responsible for acute left ventricular dysfunction. These need to be \n\n【78】excluded by appropriate tests such as serum potassium, calcium and magnesium \n\n【79】levels. Thyroid hormone assay and urinary catecholamine levels are measured if \n\n【80】thyrotoxicosis or pheochromocytoma are suspected. \n\n【81】MANAGEMENT ISSUES \n\n【82】The clinical features of myocarditis are similar to those of dilated cardiomyopathy, \n\n【83】except that the onset of symptoms and signs is rapid. Therefore, the management \n\n【84】of acute myocarditis is similar to that of dilated cardiomyopathy and follows the \n\n【85】principles of standard heart failure treatment. The clinical manifestations not only \n\n【86】evolve rapidly but also resolve within a short period of time. Loop diuretics are \n\n【87】the mainstay of therapy to relieve pulmonary edema. An angiotensin converting\n\n【88】enzyme (ACE)inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker(ARB)is added to reduce\n\n【89】cardiac afterload and to improve ventricular performance. An aldosterone\n\n【90】antagonist (spironolactone or eplerenone) may be added if symptoms persist \n\n【91】on the above treatment. Digoxin has no role in the acute setting since atrial \n\n【92】fibrillation is unusual. Antiviral drugs and immunomodulatory agents do not\n\n【93】improve clinical outcomes. 130 Section 8 Myocardial Infections\n\n【94】RECENT ADVANCES \n\n【95】The role of auto-immunity in the pathophysiology of myocarditis and subsequent \n\n【96】onset of dilated cardiomyopathy is being extensively investigated. However, so \n\n【97】far neither anti-inflammatory drugs nor immunomodulatory therapy have been \n\n【98】found to be successful. Auto-antibodies against beta-adrenergic receptors may\n\n【99】also be relevant and patients who test positive for autoantibodies may respond \n\n【100】more favourably to beta-blocker treatment.

What are the initial steps of management?\n4.  How would you evaluate the child’s hydration status?\n5.  What is your management plan?Rationale and Evidence‐based Practice Explanation\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【13】### Based on the data given, what is the differential diagnosis and the most likely diagnosis for this child?\n\n【14】The initial differential diagnosis is broad and includes gastroenteritis, appendicitis, central nervous system infection, bowel obstruction, bowel perforation/acute abdomen, diabetes ketoacidosis, and ingestion. When further considering the differential diagnosis, appendicitis is on the list because of fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and lethargy, though is less likely due to absence of rebound tenderness or tender abdomen. Central nervous system infection is considered on the differential diagnosis due to fever, emesis, and altered mental status (lethargic and irritable); a thorough neurologic examination including assessment for nuchal rigidity is needed. Bowel obstruction is considered in the differential due to frequent emesis coupled with abdominal pain, though is less likely because the emesis is not bilious and the patient is having diarrhea. A bowel perforation/acute abdomen is unlikely because of reassuring abdominal examination. Diabetic ketoacidosis is considered in the differential diagnosis due to presenting emesis, evidence of dehydration, and mental status changes, but is not accompanied by Kussmaul breathing or polyuria. Toxic ingestion should also be considered, though is less likely due to low‐grade fever and prolonged illness.\n\n【15】The most likely diagnosis for this patient is gastroenteritis because of the symptoms of diarrhea, low‐grade fever, abdominal pain, and emesis in the absence of a rigid and tender abdomen and without focal neurologic symptoms. Gastroenteritis is defined as acute onset of diarrheal illness (e.g. increase in stool frequency and/or decrease in stool consistency) that can occur either in isolation or in combination with nausea, emesis, fever, and abdominal pain. Acute gastroenteritis typically lasts less than 7 days. It is a common illness, especially in children under 5 years of age. The highest incidence of dehydration is in children under 6 months of age. Most commonly, gastroenteritis is the result of infection with rotavirus, norovirus, adenovirus, _Salmonella_ , _Campylobacter_ , and _Clostridium difficile_ . Etiology varies by geographic location and vaccination against rotavirus. Diarrheal illness characterized by frequent small amounts of stool, bloody stool, high fever, and abdominal pain are most likely to be associated with a bacterial etiology.\n\n【16】### What are essential questions to ask while obtaining the history?\n\n【17】Essential elements of the history include onset and duration of the emesis, including color (bloody, bilious) and timing (immediately after eating?); onset and color (blood, mucus) of diarrhea; fluid intake and urinary output (dysuria?); immunization history (specifically rotavirus vaccination); and contact with others with similar symptoms.\n\n【18】### What are the initial steps of management?\n\n【19】Priority is given to evaluation for presence of hypovolemic shock. If present, this must be treated immediately, as it can be life‐threatening. The child’s level of dehydration should be evaluated and treatment targeted to level of dehydration and replacement of ongoing losses. Other steps in management include initiating an age‐appropriate diet, determining the disposition (e.g. does the child require hospitalization?), and considering an antiemetic if emesis prohibits effective oral rehydration therapy or for patient comfort.\n\n【20】In general, children with acute gastroenteritis do not require diagnostic evaluation with stool studies except when the child has underlying chronic conditions, prolonged symptoms, bloody diarrhea, travel history, or during outbreaks.\n\n【21】### How would you evaluate the child’s hydration status?\n\n【22】The largest driver of morbidity and hospitalization rates associated with acute gastroenteritis is dehydration. The exact proportion of a patient’s dehydration is thought to be represented by the difference in their pre‐illness weight and their weight at time of presentation. This assessment is limited in its utility because most parents are unsure of the patient’s exact pre‐illness weight. Because of this limitation, most clinicians rely on a clinical dehydration scale which incorporates presenting symptoms to categorize the patient as having minimal (<3% loss of body weight), mild to moderate (3–9% loss of body weight), or severe (>9% of body weight) dehydration. Multiple clinical dehydration scales have been developed by several organizations . The various scales vary in their reliability in predicting actual dehydration, but can give a healthcare provider an estimate of a patient’s dehydration status that will assist with creating a management plan. All scoring tools must be used in conjunction with the individual clinical examination and history. Newer methods for estimating dehydration status have been evaluated, including ultrasound to measure inferior vena cava diameter, the ratio of inferior vena cava to aorta diameter, and bedside hand‐held bladder ultrasound scanning and digital videography to measure capillary refill time.\n\n【23】Table 4.1 Clinical dehydration scale.\n\n【24】_Source:_ Guarino, A.

Oral rehydration therapy is recommended for mild to moderate cases of acute gastroenteritis. She warrants close observation and may require intravenous fluid therapy. She should be offered an oral rehydration fluid instead of water, juice, or a sports electrolyte drink. She has lost electrolytes because of her diarrhea and emesis and therefore water would not meet her electrolyte replacement needs. A high‐glucose solution (most common in juice or sports drinks) can exacerbate diarrhea. Ideally, an oral rehydration fluid would have a 1 : 1 glucose to sodium ratio. She should be offered 50–100 mL/kg body weight of oral rehydration fluid over 2–4 hours to replace the estimated fluid deficit. Caregivers should offer small amounts of oral rehydration therapy via spoon or syringe, allowing her to drink more if she appears thirsty. In breast‐fed infants, breastfeeding should continue through oral rehydration therapy. An age‐appropriate diet can be initiated after the initial 4–6 hours of rehydration. Modified milk formula and dilution of formula is generally not needed. Enteral hydration by nasogastric route is preferred over intravenous hydration when oral rehydration is not feasible.\n\n【30】The patient requires assessment of ongoing fluid losses and replacement as needed. An antiemetic such as ondansetron can be prescribed if the child is unable to drink the prescribed amount of fluid without continued emesis. Probiotic therapy has been associated with reduction in the duration of diarrhea, but there is limited evidence of its impact on duration of hospitalization.\n\n【31】The patient does not meet hospital admission criteria at this time. However, if she were unable to complete oral rehydration therapy because of ongoing emesis or diarrhea, if oral rehydration therapy at home was unsuccessful, or if she developed signs of hypovolemic shock, she would warrant either prolonged observation in the ED or hospital admission. No laboratory studies or intravenous fluids are indicated currently. Additionally, a basic metabolic panel to assess electrolytes, specifically sodium, as well as blood urea nitrogen and creatinine to assess renal function and severity of dehydration, could be considered if she was refractory to oral rehydration therapy and developed severe dehydration. Antibiotics are not a recommended therapy for acute gastroenteritis.\n\n【32】The patient requires ongoing monitoring of end‐organ perfusion and level of hydration, and for symptoms of acute abdominal process such as appendicitis, bowel obstruction, or perforation, which are less common. If she improves after tolerating oral rehydration therapy, she can be safely discharged home with strict return instructions for deterioration in status.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The gram stain obtained from the right axilla drainage on 7/5/00showed moderate amounts of WBCs and gram-positive cocci in clusters and pairs. The culture from the lymph node biopsy on 7/3/00 was positive for 1+methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus (MRSA).

Flow cytometry and other special studies， including chromosomal and tumor marker analyses done at a reference laboratory on the biopsied node， were， however， negative for malignancy.\n\n【9】**The second admission was from 6/28/00 to 7/12/00.**\n\n【10】**Case discussion**\n\n【11】The initial admission was from 5/6 to 5/26/00. The patient had fever， severe ery-thematous， desquamating， and pruritic rash， as well as hepatitis and significant lymphadenopathy in the neck， axilla， and inguinal areas. Extensive work-up， including BM and liver biopsies， did not reveal a definitive diagnosis at the time of discharge. The patient was， however， clinically improved at the time of dis-charge on 5/26/00， in spite of the persistently elevated liver enzymes. The fever was resolved.\n\n【12】A presumptive clinical diagnosis of \"drug hypersensitivity syndrome\" was made on 5/18/00 and a decision was made to do the following： stop phenytoin and begin systemic steroid (prednisone) therapy. Although the patient was also on antibiotics (levofloxacin and vancomycin) at the time， it is believed that the fever resolved because of the withdrawal of the anticonyulsant drug， phenytoin， and the use of systemic steroids.\n\n【13】This patient continued to improve after discharge on 5/26/00. It is not clear how long she stayed on the systemic steroids after the 5/26/00 discharge.\n\n【14】The readmission on 6/28/00， however， was because of acute urinary tract infection. It is notable that as early as 6/5/00， 3 weeks before readmission， the transaminases were back to normal， with a marked reduction in the level of the alkaline phosphatase . The improvement continued through the second admission in June-July， 2000. The second spike of fever after the right axilla node biopsy was a complication of the procedure . MRSA infection of the wound/biopsy site was\n\n【15】Figure 11.3b Fever pattern noted during the second admission： 6/28-7/12/00.\n\n【16】supported by drainage of the site after the biopsy， and the positive wound culture. The fever resolved with local wound care and antibiotic therapy.\n\n【17】After discharge from the hospital on 7/12/00， she was prescribed a combi-nation of ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole by her primary care physician. At follow-up on 8/1/00， it was noted that she had developed a pru-ritic reaction； she finally completed her therapy for the axilla wound infection with clindamycin. It is not clear which of the antibiotics was responsible for the itching.\n\n【18】_·Final diagnosis： DRESS syndrome (drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symp-toms)._\n\n【19】**DRESS syndrome： discussion and postscript**\n\n【20】DRESS syndrome is a term introduced by Bocquet et al. in 1996 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> and stands for drug reaction (or rash)， with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms. Bocquet used this term to separate DRESS from other similar adverse drug reactions通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Typically， patients have fever， rash， lymphadenopathy， and internal organ involvement with systemic manifestations. The most commonly involved organs are the liver， followed by the kidney and lungs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The syndrome manifests as a severe idiosyncratic reaction that is characterized by a long latency (weeks or longer) after exposure to the offending drug.\n\n【21】Other synonymsforDRESSS iirnclude drug hypersensitivity syndrome(DHS)，anticonvulsanthypersensitivity syndrome(AHS)，drug-induced pseudo-lymphoma， and drug-induced delayed multiorgan hypersensitivity syndrome (DIDMOHS) \\[2，4\\].\n\n【22】A review by Cacoub et al. analyzed the clinical course and treatment of a large number of cases and noted a total of 44 drugs that were associated with DRESS over a 12-year period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The aromatic anticonyulsants (phenytoin， phenobar-bital， and carbamazepine) and sulfonamides are among the most common causes of DRESS syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Mortality in DRESS has been reported to range between5.2% and 10%\\[5，6\\].\n\n【23】Our patient met more than the required three European Registry of Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions (RegiSCAR) criteria for DRESS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>， but did not have eosinophilia. She was hospitalized， had a rash suspected to be due to drug hypersensitivity， had fever， enlarged lymph nodes， and internal organ involve-ment with hepatitis and renal injury.\n\n【24】Although eosinophilia is common， it may not be seen in up to 50% of patients with DRESS syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Our patient responded to withdrawal of phenytoin and treatment with systemic steroid. The BM. liver， and lymph node biopsies did not show any malignancy or other specific diagnosis. The hepatitis resolved， and the fever and rash also resolved. It is interesting that she developed pruritus after she received a combination of ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. It is speculative to consider that the sulfonamide may have been responsible for the pruritus.\n\n【25】Although this patient has had a seizure disorder since her teenage years， it was not clear from the history which other anticonyulsants she had been on in the past. However， she claimed to have been on phenytoin for at least several years before the admission in May， 2000. Whether the use of other medications， e.g. sulfonamide， precipitated her phenytoin-induced hepatitis and hypersensitivity cannot be proven with certainty. The concomitant use of drugs like sulfonamides has been shown to affect the clearance of aromatic anticonvulsants from the liver. and prolong the effect of anticonvulsants like phenytoin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【26】The latency period from initiation of phenytoin and DRESS in this instance would seem to be longer than typically reported. Her symptoms， however， resolved after discontinuation of phenytoin， and treatment with steroids. The elevated liver enzymes， lymphadenopathy， rash， and fever also resolved.\n\n【27】She was counseled to consider herself allergic or hypersensitive to phenytoin. She was to be observed off all anticonvulsants for a while， and be re-evaluated by a neurologist for an alternative treatment should she develop a new seizure. Since cross-reactivity among the major anticonvulsants is common通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>， we thought that the decision regarding alternative therapy should be left to the specialist.\n\n【28】**Lessons learned from this case**\n\n【29】· The latency period between initial drug exposure and symptoms of DRESS can be longer than the usual weeks to months. In this patient， symptoms developed after years of drug exposure， and not months.\n\n【30】· A complete history of all medications ingested (past， recent， and current)， including over-the-counter drugs， is important in any attempt to address adverse drug reactions.\n\n【31】· Delay in diagnosis of DRESS is common， because of the need to rule out other serious potential differential diagnoses： lymphoma， other malignancies， autoimmune disease， secondary syphilis， drug hypersensitivity， or other seri-ous systemic infections.\n\n【32】· As in this case， the work-up can be expensive and prolonged.\n\n【33】· An early decision to withdraw a non-critical drug may have averted the need for multiple invasive biopsies， as was done in this patient. This patient had biopsies of the BM. lymph node， and liver， all of which were non-diagnostic.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

What is the line of management in sickle cell disease?\n\n【14】**Explanations**\n\n【15】**Ans.1. Sickle cell disease is an autosomal recessive (AR) condition caused by miuuttation Ogene in B-globin chain such that existing glutamic acid (polar amino acid) at6th position is replaced by valine (nonpolar amino acid).**\n\n【16】**e cell does not traverse the small capillaries and tend to occlude them causing S cell crisis characterized by sudden， severe acute pain and malfunction of spleen， liver， bones， joints， kidney， lung and central nervous system.**\n\n【17】**RBC tends to rupture easily giving rise to hemolytic hyperbilirubinemia.**\n\n【18】**Ans.2. Sickling of RBC is due to polymerization of HbS in deoxygenated state. The replacement of glutamic acid by valine results in appearance of sticky projections in B-globin chain， which tends to adhere with existing depressions (sockets) in a-chain of other hemoglobin molecule causing them to polymerize and make a thread-like structure in deoxygenated state. This kind of polymerization of HbS distorts the normal shape of RBC causing them to appear as sickle shaped (elongated and crescent shaped).**\n\n【19】**Fig， 2： Polymerization of HbS in deoxygenated state**\n\n【20】**Ans.3.

Fungal infection of the nail is found in up to 14 % of the population. Common risk factors include nail trauma, HIV infection, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease. Around 30–40 % of the patients with nail fungus infection also have a concomitant fungal infection of the skin, particularly of the foot. The two most common toenail dermatophytes involved are T. rubum and T. interdigitate which account for 90 % of all cases. Yeast and molds account for the remaining 10 %. However, yeasts account for 30 % of fingernail infections. Three clinical patterns have been described- distolateral subungal, proximal subungual (T. rubrum and megninii), and superficial white type (T. interdigitale).\n\n【30】Psoriasis of the nail can result in yellowish discoloration (oil spot) while lichen planus can have a brown discoloration with friable changes and pitting.

On the long arm of chromosome 7 resides the gene encoding CFTR， a protein of 1480 residues that acts as a cyclic AMP-regulated chloride channel. This gene is carried by 1 in 20 Caucasians and its incidence is about 1 in 2000 live births. There is a mutation on the long arm of chromosome 7 in 70% of patients. There is a deletion of the codonfor phenylalanine at position 51\\]TP(08 (A508). This defect leads to a failure of the chloride channel to open in response to cyclic AMP. More than 175other lesions in the cystic fibrosis gene are responsible for the disease in the remaining 30% of patients.\n\n【45】**How is this condition diagnosed in infancy?**\n\n【46】Immunoreactive trypsin (IRT) assay in dried blood in neonates. A very high IRT concentration suggests pancreatic injury consistent with (but not specific for) cystic fibrosis. This assay is useful for screening rather than diagnosis. Infants who have a high IRT concentration on initial testing undergo further assessment via a repeat IRT 1-3 weeks later (IRT/IRT)， or by analysis of the initial blood spot for a specified group of CFTR muta-tions (IRT/DNA).\n\n【47】**What do you know about sweat testing?**\n\n【48】A sweat sodium concentration >60 mmol/1 is indicative of cystic fibrosis. It identifies over 75% by the age of 2 years and about 95%by the age of 12 years. It is more difficult to interpret in older children and adults.\n\n【49】**What is the basic defect in the airways of these patients?**\n\n【50】The opening of chloride channels at the luminal surface of the airway epithelial cells in normal individuals allows the passive transport of chloride along an electrochemical gradient from the cytoplasm to the lumen. In patients with cystic fibrosis， there is a defect in these chan-nels that prevents this normal secretion. Simultaneously， there isa\n\n【51】**105Cystic fibrosis**\n\n【52】three-fold increase in the reabsorption of sodium from the airway lumen into the cytoplasm of the epithelial cell. As the movement of water into airway secretions follows the movement of salt， it is believed that a decreased secretion of chloride into the airway lumen and the increased reabsorption of sodium from the airway lumen combine to reduce water content and increase the viscosity and ttenacity of the airway secretions.\n\n【53】**If the patient has persistent purulent cough， which organisms are usually responsible?**\n\n【54】_Staphylococcus aureus， Haemophilus influenzae， Burkholderia cepacia and Pseu-_ domonas aeruginosa. The last is associated with poor prognosis as this organism is almost impossible to eradicate.\n\n【55】**What is the risk of cancer in patients with cystic fibrosis?**\n\n【56】The overall risk of cancer is similar to that of the general population， but there is an increased risk of digestive tract cancers. Persistent or unexplained GI _S_ symptoms in these patients should be investigated carefully.\n\n【57】**What is the lifespan in such patients?**\n\n【58】The median age of survival is currently in the late 30s. It is possible that a child born today will have a median survival into the 50s.\n\n【59】**What is the cause of death in cystic fibrosis?**\n\n【60】Death occurs from pulmonary complications， such aspneumonia， pneumothorax or haemoptysis， or from terminal chronic respiratory failure.\n\n【61】**What parameters can predict death in cystic fibrosis?**\n\n【62】Prediction of death within 2 years can be made for 50% of the patients whose FEV is <30%. Thus the necessity for referral for transplantation can be anticipated about 1 year in advance of death.\n\n【63】**How would you manage a patient who has been accepted for transplantation?**\n\n【64】The aim is to sustain life by aggressive therapy with nocturnal oxygen， continuous intravenous antibiotics， enteral feeding， respiratory stimulants and nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation.\n\n【65】**If this patient requires lung transplantation， which type**\n\n【66】**of transplantation is the treatment of choice?**\n\n【67】SSeL Bilateral lung transplantation is necessary for patients with chronic bron-chial infection such as cystic fibrosis (or bronchiectasis) to avoid contami-nation of the donor lung by spillover of infected material from the recipient's remaining lung.\n\n【68】**What are the complications of lung transplantation?**\n\n【69】Early post-transplantation lung oedema， infection and rejection (including obliterative bronchiolitis).\n\n【70】**What are the indications for a combined heart-lung transplantation?**\n\n【71】The combined heart-lung transplantation has relatively few indications， the primary one being congenital heart disease with Eisenmenger syndrome.\n\n【72】**What are the new methods of treatment available for cystic fibrosis?**\n\n【73】●High-dose ibuprofen in patients with mild disease (FEV of at least 60%of the predicted value)， taken consistently for 4 years， significantly slows the progression of lung disease without serious adverse effects.\n\n【74】Aerosolized recombinant human DNAse (dornase-alpha)， which is capable of degrading DNA in the bronchial secretion， has been shown to improve FEV by 20% when given by aerosol.\n\n【75】Gene therapy： the gene is transferred in a carrier’ (either in a cationic _二1_ lipid envelope known as a liposome， or in an adenovirus).

She complains of sud￾den onset of back pain while playing with her grandchild 6 weeks ago and although her \n\n【3】pain is now much better with analgesia, her symptoms have not resolved completely. She \n\n【4】denies any history of direct trauma. Her pain is aching in character centred on her tho￾racic spine with stabbing exacerbations on certain movements, limiting her mobility. She \n\n【5】does not complain of any numbness, tingling or pins and needles. She is able to walk and \n\n【6】move all four limbs independently with no complaints of bowel or bladder disturbance. \n\n【7】She has had no weight loss, change in bowel habit or any stigmata of infection.\n\n【8】Her past medical history includes bowel cancer 3 years ago treated with a right hemi￾colectomy. She has had no problems since.\n\n【9】Examination\n\n【10】She had a computed tomography (CT) scan performed 1 week ago as part of her contin￾ued surveillance. This did not report any evidence of local recurrence but did reveal an \n\n【11】abnormality on bone review .\n\n【12】Questions\n\n【13】• What does this image demonstrate and what type of image is it?\n\n【14】• What is a bone scan?\n\n【15】• What is the likely cause of this patient’s problems?\n\n【16】Figure 98.1 CT scan.296\n\n【17】 ANSWER 98\n\n【18】The image displayed in Figure 98.1 is a maximal intensity projection (MIP) of the lower \n\n【19】thoracic, lumbar and sacral spine, reconstructed in the sagittal plane. MIPs are a type \n\n【20】of post-processing technique regularly used in CT, and although MIP physics are out of \n\n【21】the remit of this answer, they allow for both 2- and 3-dimensional reconstruction for \n\n【22】improved diagnostic interpretation.\n\n【23】The image has been windowed to improve bony resolution. There has been collapse and \n\n【24】loss of height of T12 in its anterior aspect with relative preservation of the vertebral body \n\n【25】posteriorly in keeping with a wedge compression fracture. There is resultant kyphosis. \n\n【26】Coronal imaging  confirms uniform loss of vertebral body height anteriorly, \n\n【27】which is accentuated more on the right than the left.\n\n【28】There are many causes of vertebral body collapse, with the most common being trauma, \n\n【29】malignancy and osteoporosis. Patients often complain of associated back pain and can \n\n【30】have neurological symptoms if there is bony encroachment of the adjacent spinal canal \n\n【31】with either cord or nerve compromise. The shape of the vertebral collapse can also be \n\n【32】seen to change the normal curvature of the thoracic spine, and in elderly people suffering \n\n【33】multilevel osteoporotic fractures, this can cause an overall loss of vertical height and a \n\n【34】severe kyphoscoliosis.\n\n【35】It is important to establish a cause for the vertebral collapse, so that steps can be taken to \n\n【36】prevent deterioration, multilevel involvement and a potential neurological deficit. Having \n\n【37】excluded a history of trauma, the main differential lies between loss of vertebral bone \n\n【38】integrity related to either malignancy or osteoporosis. Although it is impossible to say \n\n【39】with certainty that a vertebral collapse on CT is due to osteoporosis rather than malig￾nancy, other radiological studies can be employed to help distinguish between them. A \n\n【40】bone scan can be very helpful and is discussed below, with a magnetic resonance imaging \n\n【41】(MRI) scan often performed not only to diagnose any evidence of neurological compro￾mise, but to define characteristic features of acute vertebral collapse that can infer one \n\n【42】cause rather than the other. The infiltrative process of malignancy often causes diffuse \n\n【43】loss of normal bone marrow signalling on T1 imaging and post-gadolinium; abnormal \n\n【44】enhancement may be demonstrated with or without an associated epidural soft tissue \n\n【45】Figure 98.2 Coronal image.297\n\n【46】mass. As some fatty marrow is maintained in osteoporosis, associated vertebral collapse \n\n【47】often retains its concave posterior wall and is more likely solitary, as multilevel involve￾ment is more in keeping with malignancy.\n\n【48】A bone scan (also referred to as ‘bone scintigraphy’) is a common type of nuclear medi￾cine study that utilizes the normal physiological response to any bony insult, whether \n\n【49】it be malignant, infective or osteoporotic. The radiotracer technetium-99m is chemically \n\n【50】attached to methylene-diphosphate (MDP), and is preferentially taken up by osteoblasts \n\n【51】when intravenously injected into the body and incorporated into the matrix of healing \n\n【52】bone via hydroxyapatite deposition. Decay of this radioactive isotope is recorded on \n\n【53】a gamma camera and generates a skeletal image of normal physiological uptake with \n\n【54】‘hot-spots’ of radioisotope accumulation at sites of bony injury. Interpretation of the \n\n【55】distribution of tracer uptake can both imply an aetiology and also reveal other sites of \n\n【56】abnormality that were previously clinically invisible.\n\n【57】In the bone scan of the same patient, there is a focal region of increased tracer uptake to \n\n【58】the right of T12 and to the left of the lower lumbar vertebrae . Mild tracer \n\n【59】uptake is also noted at the shoulders, knees, ankles and feet. The appearances are sug￾gestive of vertebral degenerative collapse related to osteoporosis in keeping with the \n\n【60】given CT images, however a solitary metastasis cannot be excluded. Tracer uptake in the \n\n【61】joints is suggestive of further degenerative disease. Multiple ‘hot-spots’ suggest skeletal \n\n【62】metastases have not been demonstrated.\n\n【63】Figure 98.3 Bone scan.\n\n【64】 KEY POINTS\n\n【65】• CT scans have a high sensitivity at resolving bony pathology.\n\n【66】• If there is clinical suspicion of spinal cord involvement then an MRI study needs to be \n\n【67】performed. MRI can help differentiate between osteoporosis and metastatic collapse.\n\n【68】• Bone scintigraphy can reveal sites of bony involvement that are clinically invisible.This page intentionally left blank 299", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Cool Down Before Initiation of Phototherapy\n===============================================\n\n【3】John Koo <sup>1 <span class=\"ContactIcon\"></span></sup> and Mio Nakamura通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>1</sup></u>\n\n【4】通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>\n\n【5】Psoriasis and Skin Treatment Center, Department of Dermatology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA\n\n【6】Case\n----\n\n【7】A 69-year-old Caucasian female with longstanding history of psoriasis presents with an erythrodermic flare in which nearly all skin surfaces are bright red with only the face spared. Her past medical history is significant for HIV, currently under well control on anti-retroviral therapies, as well as hepatitis C. Due to her comorbid medical conditions, the decision is made to start the patient on phototherapy. However, before she can safely start phototherapy of any kind, the patient is “cooled down”.\n\n【8】The “cool down” procedure is initiated by applying liberal amounts of triamcinolone 0.01% ointment, dispensed from one pound jars, to the whole body (except the face). For sensitive areas such as the axilla, intertriginous, and groin regions, desonide 0.05% ointment is used twice daily. After applying the topical corticosteroids, the skin is covered with large sheets of saran wrap, which sticks well to the ointment without the use of adhesive tape.\n\n【9】After 1 week of the above procedure all day each day, the intense inflammation begins to resolve and the skin is no longer red and only pink. At this time, NB-UVB is initiated at 30 mJ/cm <sup>2 </sup> . The first 3 phototherapy sessions are kept stable at 30 mJ/cm <sup>2 </sup> and is tolerated by the patient without any burning symptoms or other signs that the light is aggravating the inflammation. The dose is then gradually increased very cautiously by 10–30 mJ/cm <sup>2 </sup> as tolerated, which is at a rate that is much slower than the usual dosing increment schedule. At the same time, the above cooling procedure is continued only at home. It is made sure that topical agents are not present on the skin at the time of the actual phototherapy session to ensure reasonably constant penetration of the light into the skin.\n\n【10】After 2 weeks, the erythema becomes very mild and she is able to stop the “cool down” procedure at home and instead use topical corticosteroids as needed to the affected areas. NB-UVB is continued at a frequency of 3 times per week, which is tolerated well. At 8 week follow up, the patient is tolerating NB-UVB per the usual protocol and is almost completely clear.\n\n【11】Discussion\n----------\n\n【12】It is critical for every phototherapy provider to know that extremely intense erythema, such as in this case of erythroderma , is a contraindication to any type of phototherapy, be it NB-UVB, BB-UVB, PUVA, or excimer laser 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Phototherapy, in reality, is a “double-edged sword” as it can either help or aggravate inflammation. This is easily observable by the fact that natural sunlight generally helps patients with psoriasis by decreasing skin inflammation but not if the patient gets sunburned. In fact, serious sunburn can cause Koebnerization and result in worsening of psoriasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. This implies that light therapy helps decrease inflammatory intensity until a threshold dose is reached when it turns into a pro-inflammatory force (i.e. sunburn).\n\n【13】Figure 11.1\n\n【14】Patient with erythrodermic psoriasis requiring a “cool down” procedure prior to starting any kind of phototherapy\n\n【15】The pro-inflammatory potential of phototherapy is most concerning if the patient is already extremely intensely inflamed at the time of presentation. Clinically, this “over the top” intensity can be readily identified by the “bright red” or “beefy red” coloration of the erythema . If such a patient were to receive phototherapy by error, the intensity of inflammation can become so severe to the point that the patient may have to be hospitalized with whole body edema, pain, and other complications. Therefore, it is crucial not to rush into phototherapy if the patient appears erythrodermic or near erythrodermic. It is worth emphasizing that “erythrodermic” psoriasis needs not involve 100% of the body surface area. Since psoriasis tends to spare the face, it is not unusual for a patient to present with nearly whole body erythroderma but sparing the face and possible a few other locations.\n\n【16】Figure 11.2\n\n【17】Patient with severely inflamed, “beefy” and bright red psoriasis requiring “cool down” prior to starting phototherapy\n\n【18】The above phenomenon whereby the most intensely erythematous skin can be made more inflammatory by phototherapy also applies to patient who have localized but bright red lesions; the intensity of the inflammation is key, not the amount of body surface area involved. Therefore, if a patient were to present with the most unusually intense inflammation of, for example, hand and foot psoriasis or eczema, it is still necessary to “cool down” the skin down before starting hand/foot PUVA or other light treatments. Another type of intensely inflamed psoriasis requiring “cool down” or avoidance of phototherapy all together is pustular psoriasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】The “cool down” procedure can be conducted by using liberal amounts of topical corticosteroids as explained above. Triamcinolone 0.01% ointment is most commonly used at the UCSF Phototherapy Unit as it can be dispensed in one-pound jars as opposed to tubes, which allows for easier and more generous application. Alternatively, “cool down” can be performed using a rapid-acting systemic mediation, namely cyclosporine, for both psoriasis and eczema  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>, or acitretin for pustular psoriasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Infliximab is a rapid-acting biologic agent that can also be used in the setting of erythrodermic psoriasis .\n\n【20】Table 11.1\n\n【21】Various “cool down” methods prior to initiating phototherapy for inflammatory skin conditions\n\n| “Cool down” method | Use |\n| --- | --- |\n| Topical corticosteroids under plastic occlusion | Any topical steroid-responsive inflammatory skin conditions including erythroderma |\n| Cyclosporine | Severe psoriasis (any subtype including plaque, guttate, pustular, erythrodermic, palmoplantar), severe atopic dermatitis/eczema |\n| Acitretin | Pustular psoriasis, erythrodermic psoriasis |\n| Infliximab | Erythrodermic psoriasis, severe plaque psoriasis |\n\n【23】Table 11.2\n\n【24】An example of a conservative phototherapy protocol for patients who present with erythroderma after proper “cool down” is completed\n\n|  | Initial dose (mJ/cm 2 ) | Subsequent dose increments (mJ/cm 2 ) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| NB-UVB | 30 | 10–30 |\n| BB-UVB | 5 | 5–10 |\n| PUVA | 0.25 | 0.5 |\n\n【26】After beginning the “cool down”, the patient is ready to start phototherapy once the skin is no longer red and only pink. Phototherapy is then added gingerly and increased very cautiously, especially at the beginning . At the UCSF Phototherapy Unit, patients with erythroderma is usually started at 30 mJ/cm <sup>2 </sup> (NB-UVB) and if this is tolerated for at least several treatments, then the dose is increased by 10–30 mJ/cm <sup>2 </sup> . Ultimately, the timing and rate of subsequent dose increments are up to the phototherapy practitioner’s assessment of each individual patient’s disease state and predicted response to UV light. The patient is instructed to continue the “cool down” at home until the erythema is only mildly pink. It is important that the patient does not apply any topical corticosteroids to the skin immediately prior to a treatment session as this can alter the penetration of light into the skin.\n\n【27】For most patients who present erythrodermic but undergo “cool down”, followed by phototherapy, they are eventually able to tolerate doses of light close to that of the usual protocol.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "935b1d4d-56b7-4471-98d9-72f48e9128fa", "title": null, "text": "【0】Dysglycemia\n-----------\n\n【1】The prevalence of dysglycemia is increased in acromegaly. As many as 30% of patients may have frank diabetes, and a similar percentage have impaired glucose tolerance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 30 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Pituitary surgery resulting in normalization of IGF-1 has been shown to normalize HbA1c in almost 50% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 32 \\]</u>. In those in whom diabetes persists, treatment is accepted to be the same as for type 2 diabetes in general – lowering HbA1c while avoiding hypoglycemia – and metformin is the usual first-line drug therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Until recently, a sulfonylurea or insulin has been the most common additional treatment, but the availability of antihyperglycemic agents that reduce cardiovascular risk and at the same time are less likely to cause hypoglycemia, brings a new dimension. GLP-1 receptor agonists have been shown to decrease cardiovascular risk in the general diabetes population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 33 , 34 \\]</u> and would seem to be a logical second-line therapy in acromegalic patients, though we know of no published studies supporting this. Sodium glucose co-transporter inhibitors (SGLT-2i) have also been shown to decrease cardiovascular risk in diabetes, but caution is required in acromegaly because of risk of inducing diabetic ketoacidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 35 , 36 \\]</u>. The increased availability of free fatty acids in acromegaly likely plays a pathophysiologic role in this.\n\n【3】The medical treatment of persistent elevation of GH and IGF-1 following surgery is another factor that can influence diabetes. SLRs will generally be expected to have little effect on glycemic control, since the potential benefit of decreased insulin resistance as GH levels decrease may be counterbalanced by suppression of insulin secretion. Fasting glucose and HbA1c levels are generally unchanged, but postprandial glucose may increase 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 37 \\]</u>. Occasionally however, with octreotide or lanreotide, glycemic control can worsen, so careful glucose monitoring is advisable.\n\n【4】Pasireotide , a multi-receptor-targeted somatostatin analogue, with greatly increased binding affinity for the somatostatin receptor subtype 5 (SSTR5) compared to octreotide, has been shown to decrease GH and IGF-1 more effectively, but at the potential cost of inducing hyperglycemia and worsening glycemic control in patients with diabetes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 38 \\]</u>. Baseline glucose, older age, and features of metabolic syndrome such as hypertension and dyslipidemia are predictive of the likely development of hyperglycemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 38 , 39 \\]</u>. The likely mechanism is the greater binding affinity to SSTR5 than to SSTR2; both of these receptor subtypes are found on the insulin-secreting beta cells of the pancreatic islets, while SSTR2 predominates on the glucagon-secreting alpha cells. There also is inhibition of incretin secretion by pasireotide. Therefore, insulin secretion is negatively impacted to a much greater degree than glucagon, a hormone antagonistic to insulin, resulting in hyperglycemia. Careful consideration therefore is required when weighing the potential benefits of pasireotide treatment in acromegaly against the potential hyperglycemic risk, particularly in those patients with metabolic syndrome.\n\n【5】The GH receptor antagonist pegvisomant , on the other hand, has been shown to be associated with improvement in glycemic control 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 40 , 41 \\]</u>. One study showed a decrease in HbA1c of >1.0% in patients with acromegaly and diabetes during 6 months of pegvisomant treatment. The mechanism is felt to be increased insulin sensitivity due to decreased activation of GH receptors. Higher doses of pegvisomant are typically required to normalize IGF-1 in patients with diabetes than in those without. The reason for this may be that the hyperinsulinism associated with type 2 diabetes and treatment with insulin will increase the number of GH receptors on the hepatocytes and hence also liver sensitivity to GH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 42 \\]</u>. Fasting glucose and HbA1c may decrease after addition of pegvisomant to octreotide or lanreotide treatment. However, in a study of combination treatment (pegvisomant plus SSA), fasting glucose and HbA1c increased over a 12-week period when pasireotide was substituted for either octreotide or lanreotide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 43 \\]</u>.\n\n【6】A recent consensus statement suggested that all acromegalic patients should be screened for dysglycemia at diagnosis, with continuing monitoring during follow-up, and that treatment of hyperglycemia is essential for optimal outcome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【7】Dyslipidemia\n------------\n\n【8】Several studies have demonstrated that dyslipidemia is common in patients with active acromegaly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 44 , 45 \\]</u>. Increases in total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, VLDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, and lipoprotein(a) and decreased HDL-cholesterol in comparison to control populations have all been described, with perhaps hypertriglyceridemia and increased lipoprotein(a) being the most common. Controlling acromegaly – normalizing IGF-1 – may restore these abnormalities to normal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 46 \\]</u>.\n\n【9】Recent endocrine society guidelines have endorsed the need to measure lipid profile before and after treatment of acromegaly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 47 \\]</u>. For persistent dyslipidemia in acromegaly, the use of statin drugs has been shown to be effective in improving the lipid profile 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 48 \\]</u>. We would suggest that the aim should be to reduce LDL-cholesterol to <70 mg/dL, as is the case in patients with diabetes.\n\n【10】_In our case, diagnosis of hyperlipidemia was made approximately a year before the diagnosis of acromegaly, when treatment with atorvastatin 40 mg was started. The LDL-C had an excellent response to atorvastatin which was continued after transsphenoidal surgery and maintained LDL-cholesterol just above 70 mg/dL. HbA1c, while not normal, has not been in the diabetes range and did not change after surgery. Fasting glucose decreased to within the normal range. He has not been treated_ _with any antihyperglycemic agent._\n\n【11】Sleep Apnea\n-----------\n\n【12】Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a condition that affects 20–80% of patients with acromegaly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 49 , 50 \\]</u>. Most of the cases, about two thirds, are due to the obstructive form where patients with acromegaly may develop soft tissue swelling of the airways and changes in the craniofacial bones. The remaining one third of cases are due to central sleep apnea where brain control of respiration is affected by elevated GH and IGF-1 levels. People with sleep apnea are at increased risk of hypertension and stroke 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 51 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】A recent meta-analysis found that the apnea hypopnea index (AHI) in patients with acromegaly and OSA did improve after short-term treatment of GH excess in longitudinal studies. However, overall, the prevalence of OSA and the AHI were not significantly different between patients with active and inactive disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 52 \\]</u>. It is possible that changes to the upper respiratory airways may not be fully reversible and may account for this finding. Other comorbidities that develop during the course of acromegaly such as obesity, heart failure, type 2 diabetes, and arrhythmias may also contribute.\n\n【14】Hypopituitarism\n---------------\n\n【15】Patients with acromegaly who present with macroadenomas may have hypopituitarism.\n\n【16】The rate of hypopituitarism following surgical resection for the treatment of acromegaly was found to be 12.79% (95% CI 9.88–16.00%) in a meta- analysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 53 \\]</u>. The rate of hypopituitarism following radiation is approximately 40% in the first 10 years. The most common deficiency is of gonadotropins followed by corticotropin and then thyroid stimulating hormone deficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 54 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】The mainstay of treatment of hypopituitarism is replacement of the deficient hormones which can impact the cardiometabolic risk factors. There is potential for over-treatment of adrenal insufficiency with glucocorticoids. It has been recognized that patients continue to experience increased rates of morbidity and premature mortality due to non-physiological and glucocorticoid over treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 55 , 56 \\]</u>. Modified-release hydrocortisone formulations have recently been developed as cortisol replacement therapy which may help ameliorate these effects. In contrast, insufficient thyroid hormone replacement may contribute to dyslipidemia and increased cardiovascular risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 57 \\]</u>. Low testosterone levels may be associated with dyslipidemia and other markers of increased cardiovascular risk, such as hypertension and increased inflammatory markers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 58 \\]</u>. Yet, there continues to be controversy over whether or not testosterone therapy may increase cardiovascular risk. This is probably due to the increasing use of testosterone in aging men in the absence of pituitary or gonadal disease.\n\n【18】_In our case, after pituitary_ _surgery and treatment with a long-acting somatostatin receptor ligand, his sleep apnea resolved. Periodic monitoring of free T4, testosterone, as well as cortisol levels was continued to ensure appropriate replacement and to determine whether ACTH deficiency occurs as a result of radiation.

She has been in a monogamous relationship with her boyfriend for sev-eral months. She denies any drug allergies. She occasionally drinks alcohol and smokes half a pack of cigarettes a day. She mentions that she used to take birth control pills without any problems. All three of her children were born via vaginal delivery without complication. She and her partner are free of sexually transmit-ted diseases (STDs) based on their recent checkups. She reports that she is tired of using over-the-counter contraceptives because they are inconvenient. She said that her life is very busy because of work. She fears any form of surgery and has not excluded having another child. Her laboratory workup is normal. Her physical examination is normal. She is looking for the “best contraceptive method\"for her situation.**\n\n【2】**What contraceptive options are available to this woman?**\n\n【3】**Which contraceptives are contraindicated for her?**\n\n【4】**28：****Summary： A 38-year-old parous woman presents for counseling regarding her con-traceptive options. She is in a monogamous relationship. She reports that she is dissatisfied with using over-the-counter options and that she is not ready for per-manent sterilization. She smokes a half-pack of cigarettes daily.**1\\. Know the available methods of contraception.\n\n【5】2\\. Be aware of contraindications for and of the side effects of contraceptives.**Choosing a method of contraception is a personal decision， based on individual preferences， medical history， and lifestyle. In the United States， approximately 50%of pregnancies are unintended and approximately 50% of these pregnancies end in abortion. Approximately 80% of women having unprotected sex will become pregnant within a year. All methods of contraception have a number of risks and benefits of which the patient should be aware， as well as a failure rate， defined as inability to prevent pregnancy over a 1-year period. Sometimes the failure rate is a result of the method and sometimes it is a result of human error. Each method has possible side effects. Some methods require lifestyle modifications. Patients with certain medical conditions cannot use certain types of contraceptives.**\n\n【6】**There are numerous contraceptive options available and recommendations regarding contraceptive use must be individualized. In the case given， there are several important factors that must be considered. Combined hormonal contra-ceptives are to be used with caution in women who smoke cigarettes and are not recommended for smokers over the age of 35 because of increased risk of myocar-dial infarction and stroke. Given the patient s fear of surgery and because she is not certain whether she wants to have more children in the future， surgical steriliza-tion via bilateral tubal ligation or hysteroscopic tubal occlusion or division is not a choice. A vasectomy for the partner， although potentially reversible， should be con-sidered permanent sterilization and not ideal for this patient. Barrier methods are an inconvenience to the patient’s busy lifestyle， but still a viable option. Given that both the patient and her boyfriend have no history of STDs and are in a long-term**\n\n【7】**relationship， appropriate methods of contraception for them include IUDs or pro-gestin implants. IUDs can last 3， 5， or 10 years before replacement， depending on the type used， and implants can last 3 years. Both reduce user error associated with pill and barrier contraception. Figure 28-1 is an algorithm that can be used as a guide to approaching family planning options.**\n\n【8】**Figure 28-1. Approach to family planning options.****Choosing which contraception agent is best for a patient can be complex. Review of the patient's individual situation， medical problems， and ability to remember to take medication each day are important factors to consider. Table 28-1 summa-rizes some of the characteristics of various contraceptive agents.****Fertility awareness (natural family planning or rhythm method) entails abstinence during the womans fertile period， or using a barrier method during this time period. Fertility awareness has a failure rate of up to 25% with typical use and 3%to 5% with perfect use. Women with irregular cycles have the highest failure rates. This method is dependent on the ability to identify the approximately 10 days in each menstrual cycle that a woman is fertile， which can be accomplished using calendar calculation， basal body temperature charting， cervical mucus monitoring， or the symptothermal method. The calendar calculation uses the length of past reproductive cycles to predict fertile periods. The beginning of the fertile period is calculated by subtracting 18 days from the shortest of the previous 6 to 12 cycles. The end of the fertile period is calculated by subtracting 11 days from the lon-gest cycle. For a consistent 28-day cycle， the fertile period would occur from days 10 through 17. The basal body temperature method is based on the knowl-edge that a womans basal temperature increases during the luteal phase of the reproductive cycle. Temperature must be recorded early in the morning at the same time each day. An increase of 0.4F from baseline indicates that ovulation has occurred. For this method to be most effective， a woman must either avoid intercourse or use barrier methods from the first day of menses to the third day**\n\n| **Table 28-1·CONTRACEPTION AGENTS COMPARED

also known as the withdrawal method， postcoital douching， and lactational amenorrhea. Coitus interruptus involves withdrawing the penis before ejaculation and has a 27%typical use failure rate. Postcoital douching is used to flush semen out of the vagina， but sperm have been found within cervical mucus within 90 seconds of ejaculation， so this method is unreliable. Lactational amenorrhea occurs with suppression of ovulation due to breast-feeding. During the first 6 months following delivery， women who are exclu-sively breast-feeding have mostly anovulatory menstrual cycles， and pregnancy rates have been found to be approximately 1%.**Condoms on the market are made of latex rubber， polyurethane， or sheep intes-tine. Of these types， only latex and polyurethane condoms are effective in preventing STDs by providing a good barrier to viruses and bacteria. Polyurethane condoms have a higher rate of breaking or slipping than latex， and thus higher failure rates， but they can be used by patients with a latex allergy. Each condom can only be used once. Condoms have a typical use failure rate of approximately 15%， with most of the failures a result of improper use. Perfect use failure rate is about 2%. For maxi-mal efficacy， a condom must be used with every coital act， should be in place before contact of the penis with the vagina， withdrawal must occur with the penis still erect， the base of the condom must be held during withdrawal， and an intravagi-nal spermicide or a condom lubricated with spermicide should be employed. Only water-based lubricants should be used with latex condoms as oil-based lubricants reduce efficacy.**The female condom consists of a lubricated polyurethane sheath with a flexible polyurethane ring on each end. One ring is inserted into the vagina much like a dia-phragm， while the other remains outside， partially covering the labia. The female condom may offer some protection against STDs but are not as effective as male latex condoms. The estimated typical use failure rate is estimated at 21% and per-fect use at 5%.**The contraceptive sponge is made of white polyurethane foam. It is shaped like a small doughnut and contains spermicide. The sponge protects for 12 to 24 hours， regardless of how many times intercourse occurs. It is inserted into the vagina to cover the cervix during and after intercourse. After intercourse， the sponge must be left in place for over 6 hours before it is removed and discarded. It does not require fitting by a health professional and is available without prescription. It is to be used only once and then discarded. The typical use failure rate is 32% in parous women and 16% in nulliparous women， decreased to 20% and 9% in perfect use， respec-tively. An extremely rare side effect is toxic shock syndrome (TSS).****The diaphragm is a flexible rubber disk with a rigid rim ranging in size from 2 to 4inches in diameter. It is designed to cover the cervix during and after intercourse， so that sperm cannot reach the uterus.The diaphragm must be fitted by a health pro-fessional and the correct size prescribed to ensure a snug seal with the vaginal wall. Spermicidal jelly or cream must be placed on the cervical side of the diaphragm for it to be effective. If intercourse is repeated， additional spermicide should be added with the diaphragm still in place. A diaphragm may be placed up to 6 hours before intercourse， and should be left in place for 6 to 24 hours after intercourse. TSS has also been described with diaphragm use， so a diaphragm should not be left in place for longer than 24 hours. The diaphragm used with spermicide has a failure rate of6% with perfect use and 18% with typical use.****The cervical cap is a dome-shaped silicone cap that fits snugly over the cervix. Like the diaphragm， it is used with a spermicide and must be fitted by a health profes-sional. It is more difficult to insert than the diaphragm， but may be left in place for up to 48 hours. There also appears to be an increased incidence of irregular Papa-nicolaou (Pap) tests in the first 6 months ofusing the cap， and TSS is an extremely rare side effect. The cap has a failure rate of about 18%.****Spermicides come in many forms (foams， films， creams， gels， suppositories， tab-lets) and work by forming a physical and chemical barrier to sperm. They should be inserted into the vagina within an hour before intercourse. If intercourse is repeated， more spermicide should be inserted. The only spermicidal agent in use in the United States is nonoxynol-9， which is a surfactant that destroys the sperm cell membrane.The failure rate for spermicides in preventing pregnancy when used alone is 29% with typical use and 18% with perfect use. Spermicides are available without a prescription. When spermicides are used with a condom， the failure rate is comparable to that of oral contraceptives and is much better than for either spermi-cides or condoms used alone.**", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

She was well until \n\n【3】2 years ago when she started feeling very tired and found it difficult to concentrate at work. \n\n【4】Over the next 6 months, she developed back pain and joint pains. Detailed investigations did \n\n【5】not reveal any abnormality. She went on to develop anhedonia, restlessness, poor sleep and \n\n【6】excessive appetite leading to a weight gain of 6 kg over 6 months. She was getting increasingly \n\n【7】irritable at work and so was prescribed the serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram 20 mg \n\n【8】daily by her GP. She took the tablets consistently but with no benefit. The dose was increased \n\n【9】gradually up to 50 mg a day without any improvement. After nearly 4 months of treatment \n\n【10】she had continued low mood, low energy and anhedonia. Citalopram was discontinued \n\n【11】and replaced with the tetracyclic antidepressant mirtazapine. There was an initial marginal \n\n【12】improvement in her tiredness and sleep, but this was transient. The dose of mirtazapine was \n\n【13】increased up to 45 mg per day without any benefit.\n\n【14】She continues to attend work but feels tired and fed up all the time. She denies any ideas of \n\n【15】self-harm, but acknowledges that most mornings she has thoughts that she would be better \n\n【16】off dead. She had her appendix removed 5 years ago but has no other significant medical his￾tory. There is no previous psychiatric history of note. She lives with her boyfriend and their \n\n【17】two cats in their own home. She reports reduced interest in sex, but apart from that has a \n\n【18】happy relationship with her boyfriend. Her father left her mother when she was 3 years old. \n\n【19】She has had no contact with her father since then. Her mother suffers from multiple sclerosis, \n\n【20】but there is no other family history. She has one elder sister who is well. Pre-morbidly, she \n\n【21】says that she was a happy-go-lucky person with no care in the world.\n\n【22】Mental state examination\n\n【23】Her eye contact is steady but she appears downcast and lethargic. Her speech is slow and soft \n\n【24】though she gets somewhat agitated when talking about her father. Her mood is low and her \n\n【25】affect reflects this. She describes ideas of hopelessness, helplessness and worthlessness. She \n\n【26】does not have any ideas of self-harm. There is no evidence of any psychotic symptoms.\n\n【27】Questions\n\n【28】• What is the diagnosis?\n\n【29】• How would you manage this patient?156\n\n【30】100 Cases in Psychiatry\n\n【31】ANSWER 58\n\n【32】This woman is presenting with a 2-year history of low mood, reduced energy, anhedo￾nia, reduced sleep and libido, weight gain and ideas of hopelessness, helplessness and \n\n【33】worthlessness. If organic causes of depression are excluded she thus meets the criteria for \n\n【34】a depressive episode. She has been treated with two different antidepressants (from dif￾ferent groups), using appropriate doses for an appropriate duration, but has not shown an \n\n【35】adequate response. This suggests a treatment-resistant depressive episode. The definition \n\n【36】of treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is somewhat arbitrary, but National Institute for \n\n【37】Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance defines it as failure to return to a base￾line mood state despite an adequate trial with at least two antidepressant medications. So \n\n【38】defined, 20%–30% of patients with major depression are treatment resistant. The causes of \n\n【39】treatment resistance may include\n\n【40】• Incorrect diagnosis: bipolar mood disorder, personality disorder, schizoaffective \n\n【41】disorder, depression secondary to a medical disorder, adjustment disorder, persis￾tent stress/trauma, or dual diagnosis with drug or alcohol misuse\n\n【42】• Inadequate treatment: inadequate dose or duration of treatment, poor compliance \n\n【43】or incorrect choice of antidepressant therapy (e.g. not using electroconvulsive ther￾apy [ECT] in catatonic depression)\n\n【44】This woman needs referral to specialist mental health services for management of her TRD. \n\n【45】The suggested step-wise protocol for managing TRD is as follows:\n\n【46】• Review diagnosis and alter treatment as appropriate.\n\n【47】• Review possibility of lifestyle changes.\n\n【48】• Optimize antidepressant dose (monotherapy with SSRI, venlafaxine, tricyclic anti￾depressant [TCA] or mirtazapine).\n\n【49】• Ensure adequate duration of treatment.\n\n【50】• Optimize psychotherapy and social interventions where necessary. This may include \n\n【51】considering alteration in individual therapy modality (e.g. cognitive behaviour ther￾apy, interpersonal therapy, etc.), group or family therapy.\n\n【52】• Switch to another antidepressant class (monotherapy with SSRI, venlafaxine, TCA \n\n【53】or mirtazapine).\n\n【54】• Switch to TCA, venlafaxine or monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI).\n\n【55】• Consider augmentation with lithium.\n\n【56】• Consider use of antidepressant combinations that are least prone to toxicity and \n\n【57】interactions (mianserin or mirtazapine with SSRI; TCA + SSRI; venlafaxine + SSRI, \n\n【58】etc.). Monitor for the potentially fatal serotonin syndrome characterized by the triad \n\n【59】of autonomic hyperactivity, neuromuscular dysfunction (tremors, myoclonic jerks) \n\n【60】and mental confusion or delirium.\n\n【61】• Consider use of ECT.\n\n【62】Antidepressant groups\n\n【63】• Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (e.g. fluoxetine)\n\n【64】• Serotonin–noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (e.g. venlafaxine)\n\n【65】• Tricyclics (e.g. amitriptyline)\n\n【66】• Tertracyclics (e.g. mirtazapine)\n\n【67】• Monamine oxidase inhibitors (e.g. phenelzine)157\n\n【68】Case 58: The treatment isn’t working\n\n【69】In this case, venlafaxine or a TCA may be the next management step.\n\n【70】Key Points\n\n【71】• In cases of TRD, review diagnosis, dose, duration of treatment and co-morbidity \n\n【72】(with alcohol, drugs or other psychiatric or medical disorder).\n\n【73】• Identify TRD early and refer to the specialist mental health service for manage￾ment as per protocol above.159\n\n【74】Case 59: The drugs aren’t helping", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Differential \n\n【39】diagnoses to consider include other immunobullous diseases such as bullous pemphigoid, \n\n【40】linear immunoglobulin A (IgA) disease or dermatitis herpetiformis, erythema multiforme \n\n【41】or Stevens–Johnson syndrome. If the lesions were confined to the skin only, pemphigus \n\n【42】foliaceous or staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome could be considered.\n\n【43】The diagnosis of pemphigus vulgaris, an intra-epidermal antibody-mediated autoimmune \n\n【44】blistering disease, is made on skin biopsy. Histology of a blister shows separation at the \n\n【45】suprabasal layer of the epidermis with acantholysis or individual separation of single \n\n【46】keratinocytes. Immunofluorescence of peri-lesional skin will demonstrate intercellular \n\n【47】IgG throughout the epidermis . Circulating antibodies against desmosomal \n\n【48】adhesion molecules (desmogleins 1 and 3) can also be detected, their titre often reflecting \n\n【49】the severity of disease.\n\n【50】Pemphigus is a chronic skin disease associated with significant morbidity and formerly, \n\n【51】before the synthetic corticosteroid era, a significant mortality due to infection and elec￾trolyte imbalance secondary to fluid loss. Although pemphigus is frequently responsive \n\n【52】to systemic steroids, nowadays the side effects of long-term steroid treatment mean that \n\n【53】patients are frequently treated with steroid-sparing agents such as azathioprine or myco￾phenolate mofetil. The use of plasma \n\n【54】cell targeting with rituximab, an anti￾CD20 monoclonal antibody, has been \n\n【55】shown to dramatically reduce circu￾lating autoantibodies and can pro￾vide disease control. Extensive skin \n\n【56】involvement such as this case may \n\n【57】require in-patient management for \n\n【58】supportive treatment, skin care, sepsis \n\n【59】prevention and pain relief. Specialized \n\n【60】dressings which do not adhere to \n\n【61】fragile skin may be used, but fre￾quently patients are nursed in such \n\n【62】a way as to minimize friction and \n\n【63】trauma to the skin. \n\n【64】 KEY POINTS\n\n【65】• Pemphigus vulgaris is a chronic, antibody-mediated autoimmune blistering disease \n\n【66】affecting skin and mucosa.\n\n【67】• Diagnosis is confirmed by the demonstration of bound intercellular antibodies in vivo\n\n【68】within the epidermis by direct immunofluorescence and circulating antibodies targeting \n\n【69】desmogleins 1 and 3 by indirect immunofluorescence.\n\n【70】• Immunosuppressive treatment particularly aimed at antibody suppression is the \n\n【71】cornerstone of therapy.

Her surgery was performed in another state， and she has no records. She denies other medical history and takes no medications. The patient does not use tobacco， alcohol， or illicit drugs. Her family history is unremarkable. Her vital signs are as follows： blood pressure 105/80 mmHg， heart rate 100 bpm， respiratoryrate 16 breaths/min， BMI 22 kg/m， and room air oximetry 92%. She is a thin， well-appearing woman with a healed sternotomy scar. She has an 8-cm JVD at 45° and Ⅲ/Ⅵholosystolic murmur at the left sternal border with an S3 gallop. Her PMI is not displaced. She has coarse rales in the lung bases， and her legs are warm with 1+pitting edema. Her ECG reveals sinus rhythm with a complete right bundle branch block. Her chest x-ray shows a prior median sternotomy with interstitial edema， bilateral pleural effusions， and cardiomegaly Her technically difficult echocardio-gram reveals normal left ventricular size and systolic function with a competent mitral valve. The right ventricle is poorly visualized because of artifact and nar-row rib spaces； there appears to be some degree of tricuspid regurgitation with a continuous Doppler flow signal near the great vessels from an uncertain source.**\n\n【2】**CWhat is your most likely diagnosis?**\n\n【3】**_C_ What is the best next diagnostic step?**\n\n【4】**_C_ What is the best next step in treatment?**\n\n【5】** 26：Adult Congenital Heart Disease**1\\.

To appreciate the consequences ofuntreated congenital heart disease in adults.**a pproximately 0.8% of live births in the u nited s tates are complicated by con-genital heart defects other than the bicuspid aortic valve anomaly. The develop-ment of definitive surgical and procedural techniques in infancy and childhood has resulted in marked improvement in survival for infants and children with congenital heart disease. In the 1960s the mortality prior to adulthood for patients born with congenital heart disease was 85%. In 2010 survival to adulthood for patients born with congenital heart disease survive was 85%. There are over one million adults in the United States with congenital heart disease.Bicuspid aortic valve is the most common adult congenital heart problem， with a prevalence of approximately 1% of all live births. This disorder affects men more often than women， and it may occur as a spontaneous mutation or as an inherited(autosomal dominant) disorder. Bicuspid aortic valve is associated with aneurysmal enlargement ofthe ascending aorta in 50% ofcases. This may be the result ofhemo-dynamic factors (eccentric， turbulent aortic flow) and genetic factors (early apopto-sis， cystic medial degeneration). The bicuspid valve anomaly is sometimes associated with other left-sided stenotic lesions， including aortic coarctation in 5-10% ofcases.\n\n【9】As the name suggests， bicuspid aortic valves have two aortic cusps rather than the normal three. These valves are prone to degenerative changes earlier in life than normal valves. The most common complication of bicuspid aortic valve is aortic stenosis， with peak incidence in the sixth and seventh decades of life. Mixed aortic stenosis and regurgitation is not uncommon. Bicuspid aortic valve is often an inci-dental echocardiographic finding in younger patients， whereas older patients may present with symptoms such as exertional dyspnea or chest pain. The treatment of choice for patients with symptomatic bicuspid aortic valve dysfunction is prosthetic replacement. In patients with severe bicuspid stenosis or regurgitation， ascending aortic replacement is performed if the maximum aortic dimension exceeds 4.5 cm.\n\n【10】Coarctation of the aorta affects approximately 4 per 10，000 live births and accounts for approximately 5% of all congenital heart defects. It has a strong asso-ciation with bicuspid aortic valve， as approximately half of patients with aortic coarctation have a bicuspid aortic valve. Aortic coarctation is closely associated with t urner syndrome. The precise cause of aortic coarctation is not known， but pathogenesis is felt to involve the abnormal migration of fetal ductal tissue into the wall of the thoracic aorta. Medial thickening and intimal hyperplasia occur at the site ofthe defect， which is commonly found near the attachment ofthe ligamentum arteriosum . Rarely， acquired coarctation can result from inflammatory conditions such as Takayasu arteritis or even severe aortic atherosclerosis.\n\n【11】**Adults with coarctation most commonly present in the context of a workup for severe hypertension. Untreated coarctation can lead to complications associated with severe hypertension and increased left ventricular afterload such as stroke， heart failure， aortic valve dysfunction， and aortic dissection. Classic findings include hypertension in the upper extremities with femoral pulse delay and low or unde-tectable blood pressure in the lower extremities. The diagnosis of coarctation can be confirmed by imaging modalities， including Doppler echocardiography， contrast enhanced CT， or MRI. Pathognomonic chest radiograph findings include the“3”sign with a prominent aortic bulge proximal and distal to the site of coarctation and erosive rib notching produced by intercostal collateral vessels . Treatment can include surgery， but in more recent years percutaneous dilatation and stenting has become more common. Intervention is advised if the systolic pressure gradient across the coarctation exceeds 20 mmHg or if there is evidence of signifi-cant collateral flow around the coarctation.**\n\n【12】Pulmonic stenosis is a common congenital abnormality that is found in approxi-mately 10% of all children with congenital heart disease. Stenosis can involve the valve itself， or there can be sub-or supravalvular stenosis. Pulmonic stenosis often**Figure 26-1. Coarctation ofthe aorta.**\n\n【13】**Figure 26-2. Posterior rib notching in a patient with coarctation ofthe aorta (arrow).**\n\n【14】has a benign course during childhood， and diagnosis in adulthood is common. Symp-toms of pulmonic stenosis correlate with the pressure gradient across the valve and include exercise intolerance and right-sided heart failure. Balloon valvuloplasty is recommended for asymptomatic patients for stenoses with a peak Doppler gradient> 60 mmHg or a mean gradient > 40 mmHg. In symptomatic patients intervention is recommended for peak and mean gradients of 50 and 30 mmHg， respectively.Atrial septal defects occur in 1 of every 1，000 live births. Midseptum (ostium secundum) defects are the most common， but defects adjacent to the base of the septum (ostium primum ASD)， vena cavae (sinus venosus ASD)， and coronary sinus also occur. Ostium secundum defects are usually isolated abnormalities， while ostium primum defects are associated with endocardial cushion defects and often complicate trisomy 21. Sinus venous ASDs are associated with anomalous pulmo-nary venous return to the right atrium or vena cavae. The major problem with ASDs is excessive left-to-right shunting of blood across the septum. Shunting can result in right-sided pressure and volume overload， leading to pulmonary hypertension， right ventricular failure and Eisenmenger syndrome.\n\n【15】Atrial septal defects can be diagnosed with transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiography or by cardiac MRI， which can also quantify shunt flow. ASD clo-sure is considered appropriate when the ratio of pulmonary to systemic flow is>2：1or when patients manifest evidence of right ventricular overload. Closure may be performed with open-heart surgery or catheter-based device closure； however， for technical reasons， device closure is limited to ostium secundum defects.\n\n【16】Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is a far more common abnormality that can be seen on as many as 25% of all echocardiograms， often after provocation with maneuvers such as Valsalva. Shunting in PFOs is usually minor， and right-sided overload is rare. There is an association between PFO and stroke that is incompletely understood， but one theory is that small thrombi may form between the membranes of the sep-tum and subsequently embolize. PFO is also associated with migraine headaches. At present the indications for surgical or device closure of PFOs are controversial， but it is generally considered appropriate in patients with PFO who have had recurrent despite appropriate medical therapy.the interventricular septum， but defects in the membranous portion of the septum near the base of the heart are most common. Approximately 10% of VSDs occur in the muscular septum， and 5% are located near the left and right ventricular out-flow tracts. Small (<0.5-cm diameter) Vsds tend to produce loud systolic or continuous murmurs due to high velocity flow. Flow volume with small VSDs is minimal， and these are usually asymptomatic. Larger VSDs produce softer murmurs but produce higher flow. The principal concern with VSD is volume overload of the pulmonary circuit and the development of pulmonary hypertension. Symptoms include exertional dyspnea， exercise intolerance， and edema.\n\n【17】Surgical or device closure is indicated when the shunt fraction is≥2：1 and there is evidence ofleft ventricular volume overload or if the patient has a history ofendo-carditis. One can consider closure with a shunt fraction ≥1.5：1 ifthere is evidence of increased but reversible pulmonary vascular resistance. Repair is typically via open-heart surgery； however， in select patients with membranous VSDs， catheter-based device closure may be an option.\n\n【18】Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is failed closure of the ductus arteriosus， the vascular conduit that communicates between the fetal main pulmonary artery and the aortic arch . At birth， the ductus usually closes and becomes the ligamentum arteriosum. PDA is often an isolated defect in adults and tends to affect women more often than men. Symptoms are generally related to the degree of shunting and mimic those of ASD and VSD， namely， exertional dyspnea， orthop-nea， and symptoms consistent with pulmonary hypertension. Percutaneous closure is the preferred treatment in adults with symptomatic PDA.\n\n【19】**CCFC2014**\n\n【20】**_Figure 26-3. Patent ductus arteriosus.

Physical examination reveals central cya-nosis， digital clubbing， a right ventricular heave， and a prominent or even palpable P2. Prominent jugular V waves and a systolic murmur at the left sternal border may be indicative ofrelated tricuspid regurgitation. Advanced Eisenmenger syndrome can pro-duce right ventricular failure， including peripheral edema， ascites， and hepatomegaly.\n\n【21】Management of Eisenmenger syndrome is largely supportive. Pregnancy is con-sidered absolutely contraindicated since mortality approaches 50-70%， and women with Eisenmenger syndrome should be counseled regarding contraception or sur-gical sterilization. Patients with Eisenmenger syndrome should avoid dehydration， weight-bearing exercise， peripheral vasodilator therapy， and anemia. Erythrocytosis is common in Eisenmenger syndrome， and patients with symptoms of hyperviscosity benefit from phlebotomy with saline replacement of blood volume to prevent dehy-dration. There are data suggesting that pulmonary vasodilator therapy may improve quality of life in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome. Combined heart and lung transplantation is an option for qualified patients. Life expectancy is reduced in Eisenmenger syndrome by about 20 years when compared to the general population.t ransposition of the great arteries (TGA) is characterized by discordance between the ventricles and the great arteries. In D-type transposition (D-TGA； dextrorotary TGA) the atria and ventricles are concordant， but the ventricles and great arteries are discordant . This results in separate pulmonary and systemic circu-latory beds without communication. D-TGA affects 3-4 per 10，000 live births and accounts for 3% of all cases of congenital heart disease. It was a uniformly fatal dis-ease until a few decades ago， when techniques were developed to allow for mixing of right- and left-sided circulation systems. a dministration of prostacyclin e1 keeps the ductus arteriosus patent， and balloon septostomy can be performed to create an atrium-level shunt. Once stable， the infant can then undergo a more definitive surgical repair. In patients with no other major congenital defects， the treatment of choice is an arterial switch procedure .

These surgeries involved creating an intra-atrial baffle to direct deoxygenated blood from the venous circulation into the left (venous) ventricle . The baffle also directs pulmonary venous blood to the right(systemic) ventricle. Atrial switch surgeries eliminate hypoxemia but do not correct ventriculoarterial discordance， a fact that often leads to problems later in life. For patients with D-TGA and large VSDs and pulmonic stenosis or atresia， a Rastelli procedure is usually performed. In this surgery a bafle is created to shunt oxygenated from the VSD into the aorta while a synthetic conduit is used to connect the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery.\n\n【28】**l -type transposition (L-TGA；levorotary TGA) is also called congenitally cor-rected t g a.L-TGA affects fewer than 1 in 10，000 live births and accounts for less than 1% of all cases of congenital heart disease. In this disorder there is discordance between the atria and ventricles and between the ventricles and great arteries. Thus there is normal transit of venous blood through the pulmonary circuit and into the systemic circulation， but the left ventricle is the venous ven-tricle and the right ventricle is the systemic ventricle.****Figure 26-7.

Alcoholic cardiomyopathy is characterized by a dilated left ventricle (LV), normal or reduced LV wall thickness, increased LV mass, and a reduced LV ejection fraction (<40%) in advanced stages 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Alcoholic cardiomyopathy is related to several adverse changes within the myocardium, including histological, cellular, and structural 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The pathology of these changes has several proposed mechanisms: oxidative stress, apoptosis leading to cellular loss and remodeling, impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics resulting in changes in mitochondrial ultrastructure and function, altered fatty acid metabolism and transport, and decreased myocardial protein synthesis leading to accelerated protein catabolism. Although there are multiple theories surrounding etiology, the pathology of alcoholic cardiomyopathy is not fully understood 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. With early diagnosis, proper management, and cessation (or reduction) of alcohol intake, complete recovery of cardiac function can occur 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】### 16.1.2 Prevalence of Alcoholic Cardiomyopathy\n\n【16】Approximately 1–2% of heavy alcohol users develop alcoholic cardiomyopathy, and it is estimated that 21–36% of all non-ischemic cardiomyopathies are later determined to be related to alcohol 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Alcoholic cardiomyopathy most commonly affects men aged 30–55 years with a history of heavy alcohol use (defined as more than 90 grams per day, or approximately 7–8 standard drinks) for greater than 5 years. According to the Center for Disease Control, 1 standard drink is equal to 14.0 grams (0.6 ounces) of pure alcohol. This is generally found in 12 ounces of beer (5% alcohol content), 8 ounces of malt liquor (7% alcohol content), 5 ounces of wine (12% alcohol content), and 1.5 ounces or a “shot” of 80-proof (40% alcohol content) distilled spirits or liquor (gin, rum, vodka, whiskey, etc.) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Table 16.1 displays the percentage of alcohol content per fluid ounce in each type of drink.\n\n【17】Table 16.1\n\n【18】Percentage of alcohol content per ounce of drink 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>\n\n| Type of drink  | Size (fluid ounces)  | Percentage of alcohol content (%)  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Beer  | 12  | 5  |\n| Malt liquor  | 8  | 7  |\n| Wine  | 5  | 12  |\n| “Shot” of 80-proof distilled spirits or liquor (gin, rum, vodka, whiskey, etc.)  | 1.5  | 40  |\n\n【20】Although women represent a smaller number of alcoholic cardiomyopathy cases, it is speculated that they may be more vulnerable to developing this with less alcohol consumption over their lifetime 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Men have a greater proportion of body water and women have a larger proportion of body fat. The larger proportion of body fat can result in consistently higher blood alcohol concentrations with similar levels of consumption due to the slower distribution of alcohol from the blood. Women are also known to have fewer alcohol-metabolizing enzymes, which predisposes women to the development of alcoholic cardiomyopathy despite a lower lifetime dose of alcohol when compared to men 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】Alcoholic cardiomyopathy presents as either systolic or diastolic dysfunction and may be asymptomatic (preclinical) or symptomatic (presenting with signs and symptoms of heart failure). The exact point at which alcohol-induced changes to the myocardium occur is not well established. No specific relationship between alcohol dose-response and myocardial injury has been determined. There is some data to suggest that longer durations of alcohol consumption and individual genetic susceptibility are often associated with symptomatic alcoholic cardiomyopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】The exact prevalence of alcoholic cardiomyopathy is difficult to determine since this is dependent on how patients are classified using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes. Patients with alcoholic cardiomyopathy may be classified as idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy or other nonspecific, broader diagnostic category, which would result in difficulty capturing the true number of patients affected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】### 16.1.3 Pathophysiology of Alcoholic Cardiomyopathy\n\n【24】The pathology of alcoholic cardiomyopathy is not fully understood 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. There is evidence to suggest that alcoholic cardiomyopathy is the result of defects in heart mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. It has been established that alcohol changes mitochondrial structure by producing mitochondria enlargement and degeneration of inner mitochondria membrane folds, impairing mitochondrial function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Dysfunctional mitochondria are not as bioenergetically efficient and can also generate increased amounts of reactive oxidative species, which are more likely to initiate apoptosis (cell death) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Apoptosis has been well established as a contributing factor to cardiovascular disease in general since it results in the loss of myocytes. The loss of myocytes leads to organ dysfunction, pathology, and adverse remodeling at the cellular level 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 , 8 \\]</u>. Oxidative stress within the myocardium may occur with long-term alcohol exposure either directly by stimulating the generation of free radicals or indirectly by activating another system such as the renin-angiotensin system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. It has also been suggested that fatty acid metabolism and transport may be altered contributing to myocardial dysfunction. Long-term alcohol use also accelerates protein catabolism and autophagy and decreases myocardial protein synthesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Additionally, there is some evidence to suggest genetic factors may predispose certain individuals to alcoholic cardiomyopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】16.2 Clinical Presentation and Diagnostic Testing for Alcoholic Cardiomyopathy\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【26】### 16.2.1 History and Physical\n\n【27】The diagnosis of alcoholic cardiomyopathy is typically one of exclusion in individuals with no identified etiology for cardiac dysfunction and a history of heavy alcohol abuse; thus quantifying the amount of alcohol consumed regularly is a key factor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Patients with alcoholic cardiomyopathy most often present with a clinical picture like other forms of heart failure or dilated cardiomyopathy of any etiology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Symptoms may develop insidiously or may be acute, and typically include dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal disease, and edema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Syncopal events and palpitations may also be reported since they can occur with tachyarrhythmias associated with alcoholic cardiomyopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Physical exam findings often include elevated jugular venous pressure, S3-S4 heart sounds, pulmonary rales, peripheral edema, and abdominal distention or ascites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Measurement of jugular venous pressure may be important in determining if ascites is due to alcoholic cardiomyopathy or cirrhosis as jugular venous pressure is typically normal or low-normal in cirrhosis except in the setting of tense ascites, as this can increase intrathoracic pressure. An elevated jugular venous pressure is highly suggestive of cardiac dysfunction, at the very least, being a contributing factor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Signs of liver disease may also be present, including folate deficiency, higher risk for bleeding, malnutrition, peripheral neuropathy, and neurological conditions, including Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】### 16.2.2 Diagnostic Testing\n\n【29】Initial testing when alcoholic cardiomyopathy is suspected should include imaging and testing for new heart failure diagnosis as outlined in the previous chapter of this book. This includes laboratory testing for brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). If either of these are elevated, this would suggest a component of heart failure contributing to presenting symptoms. Other lab testing would include a complete metabolic panel and a complete blood count. Higher values for mean red cell corpuscular volume and hemoglobin, mild thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver function tests may be suggestive of alcohol abuse 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. If alcohol abuse is suspected or reported, a blood alcohol level could also be obtained.\n\n【30】An electrocardiogram should be included in the initial evaluation, although findings are often nonspecific. Patients with alcoholic cardiomyopathy do, however, have similar rates of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias as those with other forms of dilated cardiomyopathy. Chronic alcoholism can result in hypomagnesemia and hypokalemia, which may contribute to the mild prolongation of QTc interval, which is a risk factor for ventricular arrhythmias 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】Chest imaging is often obtained for further evaluation of reported dyspnea and may reveal cardiomegaly; however, this has limited specificity and sensitivity for left ventricular dilation. Chest radiographs may also be helpful to identify signs of pulmonary edema and exclude other etiologies for dyspnea 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【32】An echocardiogram is the gold standard diagnostic test when the diagnosis of heart failure is suspected. Alcoholic cardiomyopathy is characterized by pronounced left ventricular or biventricular dilation, increased left ventricular mass, diastolic dysfunction, systolic impairment, and thin (or normal thickness) left ventricular walls. Around one-half of asymptomatic alcoholic subjects have a mild increase in left ventricular wall thickness without echocardiographic evidence of depressed myocardial contractility. Depressed myocardial contractility could be indicated by decreased ejection fraction, wall excursion, decreased velocity, and circumferential fiber shortening. Diastolic dysfunction often precedes systolic dysfunction, and once systolic impairment becomes apparent, diastolic dysfunction occurs more frequently 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【33】As with any new diagnosis of heart failure and/or dilated cardiomyopathy, patients should undergo evaluation for coronary disease. Noninvasive stress testing would be a reasonable first step; however coronary angiography should be considered in patients with other risk factors or suspicion of ischemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【34】Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging should also be considered if available to differentiate alcoholic cardiomyopathy from other types of cardiomyopathy. There are no distinctive features to identify alcoholic cardiomyopathy with CMR; however, this will also assess for ischemic heart disease and infiltrative diseases such as amyloid and iron overload 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Endomyocardial biopsy is not generally recommended as the histologic changes in alcoholic cardiomyopathy are similar to those present in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【35】As previously discussed, alcoholic cardiomyopathy is a diagnosis of exclusion and requires a very thorough history from the patient and family. If all other causes for cardiomyopathy are ruled out (hypertensive, valvular, ischemic, and other inherited/systemic causes) and the patient has a history of heavy alcohol use, it can be assumed that the etiology of cardiomyopathy is alcohol-related 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【36】16.3 Management of Alcoholic Cardiomyopathy\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【37】A top priority for managing patients with alcoholic cardiomyopathy is encouraging them to completely abstain from further alcohol use. Complete recovery of LV function has been reported after cessation of drinking alcohol and even if LV dysfunction persists, the symptoms and signs of heart failure tend to improve with abstinence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Supporting patients as needed (including referrals to an alcohol support group or mental health provider) and close clinic follow-up with frequent telephone contacts/visits for accountability are crucial. Patients should be provided with education regarding a balanced diet, and nutritional deficiencies should be addressed and corrected when deficiencies are noted. Vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and folate are important adjunctive therapy when a history of sustained heavy alcohol is noted. Potassium and magnesium levels should be closely monitored and corrected as well 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【38】Pharmacologic therapy to treat alcoholic cardiomyopathy is the same as other forms of dilated cardiomyopathy and includes a combination of a beta-blocker (carvedilol, bisoprolol, or metoprolol succinate), angiotensin II receptor blocker/angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin blocker-neprilysin inhibitor, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, SGLT-2, and combination of hydrazine and isosorbide dinitrate when indicated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【39】As with other forms of dilated cardiomyopathy, alcoholic cardiomyopathy is mainly characterized by dilation of the left ventricle and loss of cardiac function. This often results in systolic and diastolic dysfunction and predisposes to ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Refer to the previous chapter of this book for specific criteria regarding the potential need for an implantable cardiac defibrillator or other device therapy (biventricular pacing).\n\n【40】16.4 Prognosis of Alcoholic Cardiomyopathy\n------------------------------------------\n\n【41】Although patients with alcoholic cardiomyopathy can completely recover cardiac function with early diagnosis, proper management, and cessation (or at least reduction) of alcohol intake, a subset of patients will continue to progress and develop persistently severe symptoms despite full optimization of guideline-directed medical therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 4 \\]</u>. Advanced therapies (mechanical circulatory support and cardiac transplantation) are beneficial in carefully selected patients and require complete abstinence from alcohol per International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) guidelines. Data is very limited regarding transplant outcomes in alcoholic cardiomyopathy; however, medication adherence and relapse are common concerns for patients with a history of substance abuse 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>.\n\n【42】Overall prognosis is often adversely influenced by comorbidities such as liver disease, drug abuse, smoking, depression, and pulmonary disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.

Alcohol use can result in a pressor effect, which contributes to hypertension and an increase in left ventricular mass. Heavy alcohol use can result in a substantial increase in blood pressure. Alcohol consumption also often results in deficiencies in magnesium, potassium, phosphorus, and thiamine and can in turn further exacerbate dysfunction. Alcohol consumption can elevate triglyceride levels, causing an increase in both total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein concentration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

He developed severe diarrhea 2 days after initiation of antimicrobial therapy. Today, he is lethargic and complaining of a headache. He has had decreased urine output since yesterday. The rapid response team is activated.Past Medical History\n--------------------\n\n【5】He was born full term after an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery. He had one episode of croup at 6 months of age that required hospitalization and steroids. He has seasonal allergies for which he takes a daily cetirizine. No known drug allergies.Past Surgical History\n---------------------\n\n【6】No previous surgeries.Family History\n--------------\n\n【7】Non‐contributory. He lives with both parents and three older siblings, two dogs and a parakeet. Is in kindergarten. No recent travel.Current Status\n--------------\n\n【8】He is a well‐developed, well‐nourished, pale and tired‐appearing school‐age child lying in bed watching a movie. His vital signs are heart rate 136 bpm, respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute, blood pressure 86/42 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 94% on room air. He is 18 kg on admission; there is no subsequent weight documented.\n\n【9】His examination is notable for the following. He has dry mucous membranes, clear breath sounds with easy work of breathing, sinus tachycardia, 2+ pulses throughout, and capillary refill time of 4 seconds with warm/dry extremities. He has a non‐tender abdomen with hyperactive bowel sounds and no organomegaly. He is awake, but lethargic and irritable. It takes several attempts for him to look at the healthcare provider, respond to questions, and follow simple commands. He tells the healthcare provider that his “head hurts.” His cranial nerves II–XII are grossly intact.\n\n【10】At the time of his rapid response team call, his mother shares with the team that the child had diarrhea almost every hour last night. She is not sure if he had urine output with any of his frequent trips to the bathroom.\n\n【11】He is transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for further evaluation and management.

Is transfer to the PICU indicated?\n3.  What are the initial steps of management?\n4.  How will you correct the electrolyte derangement?\n5.  What complications will you monitor for?Rationale and Evidence‐based Practice Explanation\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】### Based on the information provided, what is the most likely diagnosis for this patient?\n\n【18】This patient has hypernatremia. Supported by his diarrheal losses, physical examination and vital signs, he is also dehydrated. He has hypernatremic dehydration. Hypernatremia is defined as serum sodium greater than 150 mEq/L and hypernatremic dehydration signifies a greater water loss in relation to total body sodium. There are various ways that a patient can develop hypernatremic dehydration. The patient in this case study developed hypernatremic dehydration from fluid losses. All gastrointestinal losses (emesis or diarrhea) are hypotonic because they have a sodium concentration less than the plasma sodium concentration. An excessive loss of hypotonic fluid (emesis or diarrhea) resulting in an increase in output can lead to hypernatremia. This type of electrolyte disturbance typically occurs gradually, which explains why the patient is less symptomatic than if the hypernatremic state had occurred abruptly.\n\n【19】Severe hypernatremic dehydration can cause a spectrum of neurologic symptoms, including altered mental status, cerebral hemorrhage, seizures, and encephalopathy. The mechanism of intracranial hemorrhage is explained by tearing of the cerebral blood vessels (bridging veins) as the dehydrated brain tissue shrinks.\n\n【20】### Is transfer to the PICU indicated?\n\n【21】Yes, this patient is experiencing hypernatremic dehydration with associated mental status changes. He will require close monitoring of his neurologic status and laboratory values during rehydration and sodium correction. The morbidity and mortality associated with hypernatremia is typically not from the disorder itself, but from inappropriate management (e.g. excessively rapid correction). He will require slow rehydration with frequent monitoring of serum sodium levels because a rapid decrease in serum sodium can result in cerebral edema, seizures, or osmotic demyelination syndrome.\n\n【22】### What are the initial steps of management?\n\n【23】Throughout the management of this patient, it is essential to ensure slow and careful rehydration. Rapid decrease in serum sodium can result in severe neurologic complications. The initial step in management is to begin careful fluid resuscitation to restore the intravascular volume. Isotonic fluid must be used for fluid resuscitation, using small aliquots (10–20 mL/kg) unless the patient has evidence of hypovolemic shock. Normal saline has a sodium concentration of 154 mEq/L and is thus technically a hypotonic fluid in the presence of a serum sodium of 160 mEq/L in this hypernatremic child. Therefore, if the child remains hemodynamically stable, only a single, small, fluid bolus of normal saline should be administered prior to rechecking the serum sodium.\n\n【24】### How will you correct the electrolyte derangement?\n\n【25】The goal is to decrease his serum sodium by 10–15 mEq/L per day, which is roughly 0.5 mEq/L every hour. To achieve this slow decrease in serum sodium, begin by calculating the free water deficit using the following formula:\n\n【26】This child’s free water deficit, if targeting a serum sodium of 145 mEq/L (rather than 140 mEq/L in the equation above) is 1.1 L.\n\n【27】This amount of fluid (1.1 L or 1100 mL) will be administered over 48 hours at a rate of 23 mL/hour. It is important to note that the rehydration fluid (the FW deficit calculated rate) will be administered in combination with maintenance fluids. For the patient, this would be a total fluid rate of 79 mL/hour (23 mL/hour of rehydration fluid plus 56 mL/hour of maintenance fluids). Once the rate of intravenous fluid therapy has been determined, the next step is to select the type of fluid to be administered. Dextrose 5% with 0.2% normal saline is the typical intravenous fluid of choice for mild to moderate dehydration, but the sodium concentration may need to be increased depending on the serum sodium value and rate of decrease in serum sodium. The serum sodium should be evaluated 2 hours after the initiation of intravenous therapy, and then every 2–4 hours thereafter. If the serum sodium is decreasing by more than 0.5 mEq/L per hour, increase the sodium concentration in the intravenous fluids.\n\n【28】### What complications will you monitor for?\n\n【29】Seizures, rapid decrease in sodium, signs of cerebral edema (pupillary changes, mental status changes and late findings of Cushing’s triad), and cerebral sinus venous thrombosis should be be monitored for. The speed of sodium reduction is the key determinant as to whether a patient develops complications from electrolyte shifts.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The patient reports no recent changes in normal bowel habits. Physical examination shows hepatosplenomegaly. Bowel sounds are normal. On questioning, the patient reports that he traveled to Brazil several months ago to study tribal medical practices. He frequently went swimming in the Amazon River to wash himself. Several weeks after returning from his trip, he recalls having fever, diarrhea, weight loss, and “funny looking” stools. Which of the following conditions is most likely responsible for this patient’s present symptoms?\n\n【1】> (A) Appendicitis\n\n【2】> (B) Bowel obstruction\n\n【3】> (C) Enterocolitis\n\n【4】> (D) Portal hypertension\n\n【5】> (E) Ruptured viscus\n\n【6】 **Answer**: The correct answer is D . Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease with hepatic involvement. _Schistosoma mansoni_ larva, which are commonly found in fresh waters of South America, penetrate the host’s skin, invade the peripheral vasculature, and eventually settle in the portal or pelvic venous vasculature. Several weeks following infection, patients may develop symptoms similar to the ones described, such as fever, diarrhea, and weight loss; the “funny looking” stools likely represent _S mansoni_ eggs. Chronic infection may eventually lead to portal hypertension and hepatosplenomegaly, leading in turn to ascites and eventually cirrhosis. In addition, the hepatosplenomegaly leads to esophageal varices, producing bleeding that can often be the first clinical sign.  \n\n【7】Answer A is incorrect . Appendicitis commonly presents with right lower quadrant abdominal pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, and leukocytosis. The ascites seen in this patient is not a typical finding with appendicitis.  \n\n【8】Answer B is incorrect . Bowel obstruction generally presents with nausea, vomiting, and decreased or absent bowel sounds. This patient has none of these signs or symptoms. The patient does not have risk factors for bowel obstructions, which include hernias, previous abdominal surgeries, or colon cancer. It should also be noted that this patient reports no changes in his normal bowel habits. If a bowel obstruction were producing his symptoms, he would not be passing gas or having bowel movements.  \n\n【9】Answer C is incorrect . Enterocolitis would not present with signs and symptoms of ascites. It usually manifests with diarrhea; however, this patient’s current symptoms do not include changes in bowel habits. It is not a chronic disease and cannot cause portal hypertension.  \n\n【10】Answer E is incorrect . Ruptured viscera may present with signs of peritonitis such as rebound tenderness. Rupture may result from ischemic bowel disease or obstruction. This patient’s history, physical examination, and imaging studies are inconsistent with this etiology.

A variety of factors impact growth, and in fact, different hormones impact growth throughout childhood and adolescence. Growth during the fetal period is the fastest and relates predominantly to maternal health and nutrition. During infancy, growth progressively slows and infants often cross to a length percentile more in line with their genetic potential. After the age of 2, growth in the prepubertal child should become somewhat constant, growing 5 cm per year or more. Height velocity of 4 cm or less per year or shifting major percentiles during this time frame is less common. Growth then accelerates during puberty and then eventually after puberty is complete, the epiphyses fuse and growth is complete 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 – 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】To assess growth, measurement of length or height must be accurate, which can be accomplished using fixed measurement equipment and proper positioning. Children younger than 2 years should be measured in a supine, recumbent position. The child’s head is positioned against a fixed and rigid measuring board in the Frankfurt plane, in which the outer canthi of the eyes are in line and external auditory meatuses are perpendicular to the long axis of the trunk; shoes should be off, legs fully extended and feet maintained perpendicular to the plane of the supine infant. Standing height (no shoes) should be obtained using a stadiometer with the head in the Frankfurt plane and the back of the head, thoracic spine, buttocks, and heels approximating the vertical axis of one another and the stadiometer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】The length or height is plotted on the growth chart; each chart is composed of sequential percentile curves showing the distribution of length or height, indicating the percentage of children at a given age on the _x_ \\-axis whose measured value falls below the corresponding value on the _y_ \\-axis. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommend the use of the 2006 World Health Organization (WHO) growth curves for children 0–24 months of age and the 2000 CDC growth curves for children ages 2–19 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 – 7 \\]</u>. Specialized growth charts have been created for children with various conditions , including very-low birth weight, small for gestational age, trisomy 21, Turner syndrome, and achondroplasia, and should be utilized when appropriate. Growth failure is defined as a growth velocity below that expected for a child’s age, sex, and pubertal stage or the downward crossing of two or more major height percentiles 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. In addition, the child’s genetic height potential, or sex-adjusted mid-parental height, should be considered, calculated by adding together the heights of the biological parents , either adding 5 inches (13 cm) for a boy or subtracting 5 inches (13 cm) for a girl, and then dividing the total in half 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. By following the stature on the growth chart at each visit, one can get a sense of the growth pattern and assess for abnormalities . Any deviations from normal growth patterns or the child’s genetic height potential should be evaluated. Evaluation and therapy differ depending on the likely cause of the short stature, and a detailed history and physical examination can often suggest the diagnosis and guide the workup as demonstrated in the cases below.\n\n【20】Growth Hormone Deficiency\n-------------------------\n\n【21】Growth hormone (GH) is a critical hormone in regulating growth. It is synthesized and secreted from the anterior pituitary somatotrophs in a pulsatile fashion. Secretion is regulated by the hypothalamic peptide hormones GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) and somatostatin, which, respectively, stimulate and inhibit GH release. Growth hormone production is primarily regulated by GHRH, while somatostatin affects the timing and amplitude of GH secretion. The combined effects result in the pulsatile nature of growth hormone and can be altered by a variety of factors including neurotransmitters, neuropeptides , and other hormones, many of which are secreted during normal physiologic states such as stress, sleep, fasting, and exercise, as well as feedback from the insulin-like growth factor polypeptides. Circulating GH is attached to GH-binding protein (GHBP), which corresponds to the extracellular domain of the GH receptor. Binding to the receptor induces downstream production of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and its carrier protein insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) , which mediates many of the growth hormone’s actions triggering cellular hypertrophy and proliferation in target tissues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. The circulating levels of these growth factors correlate with GH secretion but are not subject to the same fluctuations seen in growth hormone levels and, therefore, often are useful in evaluation as discussed later in this chapter. Disruption of the GH–IGF axis can occur at any level  leading to clinical presentation with short stature.\n\n【22】Table 1.1\n\n【23】Differential causes of disruption of the GH–IGF axis\n\n| Hypothalamus  | Congenital malformations, such as holoprosencephaly Traumatic brain injury Encephalitis/meningitis Central nervous system tumors  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Pituitary  | Ectopic pituitary/pituitary hypoplasia Anencephaly or agenesis of the corpus callosum Pituitary tumors Hypophysitis Idiopathic GH deficiency  |\n| GH receptor  | Laron syndrome  |\n| Post receptor signaling  | IGF insensitivity  |\n\n【25】### Case Presentation 1\n\n【26】_An 18-month-old female presents with growth failure. Weight and length at birth were appropriate for gestational age with significant hypoglycemia following delivery requiring a 1-week NICU hospitalization. She was discharged home feeding every 2–3 h with no further glucose monitoring. Mother notes she has been followed closely for developmental delay and she has not yet started to walk. Exam is notable for a height −2.5 SD, maxillary hypoplasia, and a prominent forehead._\n\n【27】Isolated GH deficiency (GHD) occurs in as many as 1 in 3500 to 1 in 10,000 children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 – 14 \\]</u>. Infants with congenital isolated GHD tend to have a normal birth size; however, postnatal growth is abnormal. Severe GHD in early childhood results in growth failure by 6 months of age, increased truncal adiposity, and slower muscular development, potentially resulting in delayed gross motor milestones. Some children with severe GHD have the classically described cherubic facial features including maxillary hypoplasia and a prominent forehead. Milder GHD may present after 1 year of age.\n\n【28】### Case Presentation 2\n\n【29】_A 14-day-old male is admitted with prolonged conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. On exam, micropenis is noted. Imaging shows the absence of the septum pellucidum concerning for septo-optic dysplasia_ ( _SOD_ ) .\n\n【30】The image consists of three scans of the brain. The first one has the T 2 coronal image. The second displays an absence of septum pellucidum. And the third has a small pituitary gland and ectopic location of the neurohypophysis. In the first two images, the area is marked with a circle, and in the last image, the area is marked with an arrow.\n\n【31】Fig. 1.1\n\n【32】T2 axial ( a ) and T2 coronal image ( b ) from MRI study in a 14-day-old patient with absent septum pellucidum and characteristic dysmorphic frontal horns seen in the spectrum of septo-optic dysplasia.

On physical exam, it is important to evaluate for dysmorphic features and midline defects such as a central maxillary incisor or cleft palate suggesting possible hypothalamic or pituitary malformations. Septo-optic dysplasia , more commonly seen in children born to younger mothers, is characterized by any two of the three features: midline forebrain defects, optic nerve hypoplasia, and hypopituitarism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Approximately two-thirds have some degree of hypopituitarism varying from isolated GH deficiency followed by TSH and ACTH deficiency to panhypopituitarism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>.\n\n【34】### Case Presentation 3\n\n【35】_A 12-year-old female presents with poor growth, headaches, and changes in vision.

Because of the pulsatile secretion described above, measurement of a random serum GH level is not useful except in the neonatal period before the development of sleep entrainment . Screening instead involves measuring IGF-1 level, which is produced primarily in the liver in response to GH and its carrier protein IGFBP-3, which regulates the availability of free IGF-1 to the tissues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>.\n\n【42】Further evaluation may include provocative GH testing. Typical agents used in children include arginine, clonidine, glucagon, and L-dopamine. Provocative growth hormone testing should only be used in patients with a high pretest probability as testing is non-physiologic, lacks precision, and is often not reproducible with marked inter-assay variability. Testing is also invasive, expensive, and potentially risky, with each agent having its own risks , and results are not predictive of response to treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>.\n\n【43】Table 1.2\n\n【44】Provocative GH testing agents\n\n| Agent  | Time peak of GH  | Side effects  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Arginine  | 60 min  | Cautious use in patient populations with high prevalence of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency  |\n| Clonidine  | 60 min  | Modest hypotension, hypoglycemia  |\n| Glucagon  | 2–3 h  | Nausea, vomiting, sweating, headaches  |\n| Insulin a  | 45 min  | Rarely used in children due to severe hypoglycemia requiring careful glucose monitoring  |\n| L-dopamine  | 45 min  | Nausea, vomiting  |\n| Macimorelin  | Approved for use in the adult population with suspected GHD.

He complains of \n\n【3】left-sided chest pain on inspiration. On further questioning it becomes apparent that he \n\n【4】has had a recent fall. He lives alone and independently with frequent visits from his \n\n【5】daughter who is concerned that there have been several falls. The patient is on blood \n\n【6】pressure medication and takes a statin for previously high cholesterol. Reviewing his \n\n【7】notes you see a previous attendance 2 years earlier for a fall and several episodes of \n\n【8】treatment for pneumonia. There is a past history of smoking but no other significant \n\n【9】medical history.\n\n【10】Examination\n\n【11】The observations are normal. He is thin. There is some bruising over the left side of the \n\n【12】thorax and a notable low thoracic kyphosis. There are bilateral fine inspiratory crackles. \n\n【13】The heart sounds are normal. The abdomen is unremarkable and no neurological or sig￾nificant cognitive abnormality is noted.\n\n【14】A chest radiograph , electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood tests are arranged.\n\n【15】Questions\n\n【16】• What does the radiograph show?\n\n【17】• What is the differential diagnosis?\n\n【18】• What further imaging would you consider?\n\n【19】• What other investigations should you consider?\n\n【20】Figure 39.1 Chest radiograph.118\n\n【21】 ANSWER 39\n\n【22】Although the history and examination make rib fractures very likely, radiology is rarely \n\n【23】indicated simply to look for low energy traumatic rib fractures. In this patient’s case there \n\n【24】are questions as to the cause of the fall. A chest radiograph is indicated for a possible \n\n【25】chest infection or lesion and a thoracolumbar spine radiograph for the possible cause of \n\n【26】the kyphosis.\n\n【27】The chest radiograph shows recent fractures of the left sixth to ninth ribs posterolaterally. \n\n【28】There are also old fractures of the right ribs posterolaterally. Features that are common \n\n【29】in trauma are fractures in a line and a posterolateral position, although this will depend \n\n【30】on the type of trauma. Old fractures have healed and the bone cortex is continuous but \n\n【31】the rib may be distorted. Recent and new fractures have discontinuous cortex but recent \n\n【32】fractures show signs of healing with callus and bone remodelling that is absent in new \n\n【33】fractures.\n\n【34】Do not stop looking once you have seen the fractures! Also look for other fractures (e.g. \n\n【35】spine), bone lesions and examine the lungs, pleura and heart. On this radiograph there \n\n【36】is consolidation in the right lower zone and a probable hiatus hernia gas bubble behind \n\n【37】the heart.\n\n【38】The spine radiograph reported wedge compression fractures of the T11 and T12 vertebral \n\n【39】bodies together with some small sclerotic and lytic lesions in the lumbar vertebrae. The \n\n【40】initial blood tests show iron deficiency anaemia and raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate \n\n【41】(ESR). This suggests an underlying systemic disease that affects bone and includes bowel \n\n【42】or chest malignancy with bone metastases, myeloma or prostate carcinoma. The patient \n\n【43】should be referred to the older person team for further investigation. From an imaging \n\n【44】point of view this probably includes a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, \n\n【45】abdomen and pelvis, although a bone scan could be helpful if sclerotic bone metastases \n\n【46】from prostate or bowel carcinoma are suspected.\n\n【47】If blood tests suggest myeloma, a skeletal survey for lytic lesions could be done. Bone \n\n【48】scans have lower sensitivity for lytic bone lesions which appear as photopenic regions \n\n【49】of reduced uptake. The tracer used in bone scans, 99Tc-MDP (technetium-99 conjugated \n\n【50】with methylene diphosphonate), is taken up primarily by osteoblastic activity typical in \n\n【51】sclerotic bone lesions.\n\n【52】The National Service Framework for older person care recommends a formal falls assess￾ment in patients at risk and regular medication review.\n\n【53】 KEY POINTS\n\n【54】• Radiology is rarely indicated simply to look for rib fractures.\n\n【55】• In older patients the ‘Occam’s razor’ approach of assuming only one underlying \n\n【56】pathology has to be modified to allow for several interacting pathologies.\n\n【57】• Avoid ‘satisfaction of search’ and keep looking after spotting the first abnormality.119", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

As seen in the image the presence of many lymphocytes and few Reed-Sternberg cells with collagen bands that circumscribe the lymphoid tissue into discrete nodules is consistent with the nodular-sclerosing subtype of Hodgkin disease. This is the subtype with the best prognosis, and it also is the most common. Nodular-sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma is more common in women. This histologic picture also resembles the lymphocyte-predominance subtype, which is much less common but has an excellent prognosis; it also is found in women.  \n\n【8】Answer A is incorrect . AML does not affect the lymph nodes but, rather, produces abnormalities in the blood and bone marrow. This disease usually affects patients of middle age (35-50 years) and is characterized by the presence of numerous myeloid precursor cells with the presence of Auer’s rods.  \n\n【9】Answer B is incorrect . Burkitt lymphoma is a non-Hodgkin type of lymphoma that predominantly is a B-lymphocyte lymphoma. It is associated with Epstein-Barr virus infections that can lead to activating mutations of _c-myc_ caused by chromosomal translocation t(8;14). Histologically Burkitt lymphoma is characterized by sheets of lymphocytes with interspersed macrophages; this is referred to commonly as a “starry sky” appearance.  \n\n【10】Answer C is incorrect . Any type of Hodgkin disease (HD) involving many Reed-Sternberg cells and no or few lymphocytes describes the rare lymphocyte-depletion subtype. This has the worst prognosis of any type of HD and generally is present in elderly men with disseminated disease.  \n\n【11】Answer D is incorrect . The heterogeneous mixture of many mononuclear cells, many Reed-Sternberg cells, and many lymphocytes is consistent with mixed-cellularity HD. This subtype is more common in men and more likely to be diagnosed at a later stage.

Patients with MACS present with a higher prevalence of cardiovas-cular risk factors and events， osteopenia and osteopo-rosis， and increased risk of fractures. Adrenalectomy leads to improvement of comorbidities in 20%-70% of patients； however， estimating the degree of improve-ment prior to adrenalectomy is challenging.\n\n【3】The patient was a 54-year-old woman who pre-sented for evaluation of continuous weight gain of50 pounds over 5-7 years. In addition， she had prediabetes (glycosylated hemoglobin= 6%， not medications) and hypertension treated with metoprolol tartrate 25 mg twice a day and nifedip-ine 30 mg daily. Two years prior， she was diagnosed with osteoporosis. Several months prior， she was incidentally discovered with a 2.2-cm left adre-nal mass initially visualized on chest computed tomography (CT) and further better characterized on abdominal CT . Physical exam was positive for body mass index of 39.8 kg/m²and blood pressure of 138/86 mmHg， but no features of Cushing syndrome.\n\n【4】**INVESTIGATIONS**\n\n【5】On unenhanced CT of adrenal glands， the left adrenal mass was lipid rich (6 Hounsfield units \\[HU\\])， mea-suring 2.2 cm in the largest diameter . The right adrenal gland appeared normal. The base-line laboratory test results are shown in Table 5.1. The serum corticotropin (ACTH) and dehydroepiandros-terone-sulfate (DHEA-S) concentrations were low， and cortisol did not suppress normally with an overnight1-mg dexamethasone suppression test (DST). MACS was diagnosed.\n\n【6】**TREATMENT**\n\n【7】The patient was counseled that the adrenal mass was a benign adrenal adenoma that was producing cortisol autonomously. Malignancy was excluded based on the imaging phenotype (<10 HU). MACS was diagnosed based on an abnormal DST (cortisol >1.8 mcg/dL)，as well as low ACTH and DHEA-S. The patient was coun-seled about possible relationship of MACS and cardio-vascular comorbidities (e.g.，hypertension， prediabetes， obesity)， and conservative management versus adrenal-ectomy was discussed. A decision on adrenalectomy was made.

The bleeding had stopped; however, several broken flight feathers on both wings resulted in dried blood, covering the feathers on the wings and body coverts.\n\n【7】The client reported that the bird had been picking her feathers for the past 2 years, and this behavior had gotten worse during the past year. She also reported that the bird was presented to a veterinarian who specializes in birds a year earlier for a mass just cranial to the cloaca on the ventral side of the bird. At that time, the mass was considered to be benign and of no concern, according to the veterinarian. The \"mass\" had increased dramatically in size since that time. The bird laid a normal clutch of two eggs 4 months prior to presentation.\n\n【8】The bird was housed in a commercial birdcage and fed a diet of commercial pellets and nuts. Other pets in the household included three dogs, a cat, and a Rosella parrot _(Platycercus_ sp.).﻿\n\n【9】Physical Examination Findings\n\n【10】The 1.1-kg cockatoo was extremely nervous and exhibited frightened behavior and signs of stress in the examination room. Although it did not vocalize, it tried to escape capture. The bird exhibited severe alopecia owing to feather picking, resulting in a large area of missing feathers on the enlarged abdominal area. A large herniated area just cranial to cloaca was observed. Palpation of this area indicated soft-tissue structures and no hard mass. The droppings appeared normal, suggesting normal gastrointestinal and urinary function.\n\n【11】Blood was collected via jugular venipuncture for a blood profile while the bird was placed under isoflurane anesthesia via face mask for whole body radiograph evaluations. A fine-needle aspiration biopsy of an in-tracoelomic mass was obtained for cytodiagnosis. The sample appeared clear and greasy when placed on the microscope slides .﻿\n\n【12】Interpretive Discussion\n\n【13】The initial whole body radiographs  reveal a large soft-tissue opaque mass in the caudal dorsal aspect of the coelomic cavity, causing cranial and ventral displacement of the coelomic structures. This likely represents a neoplastic mass arising from the reproductive tract. There appears to be a marked enlargement of the hepatic silhouette, extending beyond the margins of the coxofemoral joint on the ven-trodorsal view. The enlarged hepatic silhouette can be associated with hepatomegaly, proventricular dilation, or an intracoelomic mass. There is a rounded soft-tissue opacity, extending beyond the caudal ventral aspect of the vent correlating with this patient's described history of having a hernia. The hernia is likely due to the space occupying mass in the caudal dorsal coelomic cavity. A rounded, oblong soft-tissue opacity ventral to the synsacrum can be seen on the lateral view. This likely represents either renomegaly or gonadomegaly. There is increased opacity within the long bones, representing medullary hyperostosis associated with follicular genesis.\n\n【14】Fig. 63.1 .

A fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the intracoelomic mass (Wright–Giemsa stain, 50x).\n\n【18】A continued radiographic study  of the bird is compared with the initial study made the same day 85 minutes following the administration of 25 mL of a 92% liquid barium suspension diluted 1:2 with water via gavage. The proventriculus is normal in size. Owing to the limited progress of the barium's travel through the gastrointestinal tract after 85 minutes, the bird likely has decreased gastrointestinal motility. There is contrast within the small intestines, which is being ventrally displaced by the previously described soft-tissue mass in the caudodorsal coelomic cavity. There is a loop of small intestine (likely duodenum based on its shape) incorporated into the previously described hernia. The radiographic studies in this bird indicate herniation of small intestines owing to displacement by a soft-tissue mass in the coelomic cavity. Differentials include neoplasia arising from the urinary system or reproductive tract.\n\n【19】Fig. 63.5 . (a and b) The fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the intracoelomic mass (Wright–Giemsa stain, 100x).\n\n【20】The blood profile reveals a nonregenerative anemia. This is likely associated with an anemia of chronic disorders. There is no evidence of inflammation. The glucose is elevated, which is likely associated with a stress response. The plasma creatine kinase activity is increased owing to muscle exertion during handling or possible recent trauma to the skeletal muscles (the bird fell from the examination table onto the floor landing on her keel when being examined). The marked increase in the plasma calcium concentration is likely associated with current folliculogenesis activity as indicated by the hyperostosis of the long bones in the radiographic examinations.\n\n【21】Table 63.1 .

There are large cells that occur in aggregates or singly. These cells have an abundant vacuolated cytoplasm and an eccentrically located oval nucleus. The background contains numerous round, clear spaces. These spaces and the clear vacuoles in the cells likely represent fat that does not stain with the Wright–Giemsa stain. The large cells are adipocytes and the cytology is representative of a lipoma or liposarcoma. The clear, oily appearance of the specimen on the slide indicates that the sample is from fatty tissue.\n\n【28】The blood profile and radiographic evidence of hy-perostosis indicating active folliculogenesis and the history of the bird laying a clutch of normal eggs 5 months prior to presentation suggest a normal female reproductive tract. The intracoelomic mass seen on radiographs likely does not involve the gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract, or reproductive tract. The cytologic examination of the sample aspirated from the coelomic mass indicates fatty tissue and supports a diagnosis of an intracoelomic lipoma, infiltrative lipoma, or lipo-sarcoma.﻿\n\n【29】Summary\n\n【30】The cockatoo was admitted for an intracoelomic exploratory surgery to investigate the nature of the in-tracoelomic mass and repair the hernia.\n\n【31】The cockatoo was given 1.1 mg butorphanol, 0.33 mg midazolam, and 0.033 mg atropine intramuscularly as a preanesthetic treatment. Twenty minutes later, the bird was induced and maintained with isoflurane anesthesia following endotracheal intubation using a 4.0 mm tube. During the 1 hour and 24 minutes surgery, the bird was given 48.8 mL lactated Ringer's solution intravenously via a catheter placed in the basilic vein. The bird also received 5 mL of an esterified amylopectin-containing starch (hetastarch) intravenously during the procedure. Prior to recovery, the bird received 0.5 mg meloxicam intramuscularly and 1.0 mg butorphanol intramuscularly.\n\n【32】The bird was placed in dorsal recumbency, and ra–diocautery was used to create a skin incision extending 2 cm from the caudal point of the keel to just cranial to the herniated area cranial to the cloaca. A body wall incision was made using radiocautery to expose the contents of the coelomic cavity. A large amount of yellow fat was found, occupying the majority of the coelomic cavity and encircling the ventriculus . A large amount of fat along with the duodenum was found herni-ated through the body wall. As much as possible, the fat was carefully removed using blunt dissection. A cloa–copexy using 5-0 polytrimethylene carbonate suture was used to close the body wall in a simple continuous pattern in the area of the hernia. The rest of the body wall was closed using the same material and pattern. The skin was closed using a 4-0 glycomer 631 suture in a simple interrupted pattern. A portion of the fatty tissue removed from the bird's coelomic cavity was submitted for histopathologic evaluation.\n\n【33】Fig. 63.6 . A large amount of intracoelomic fat found during surgery.\n\n【34】The bird made an uneventful recovery from anesthesia and surgery and was placed in the critical care facility for close observation for 12 hours. She was treated with meloxicam (0.5 mg PO daily) postoperatively. Although she made no attempt to remove her sutures, she was sent home with an Elizabethan collar designed for birds in the event she pull at the sutures. At home the bird was less active than normal; however, she was eating and playing with her toys according to the client. The bird died 29 hours following her surgery possibly as a result of reperfusion problems or lipid embolism. No necropsy was performed.\n\n【35】Histopathologic evaluation revealed sheets of normal adipocytes with moderate infiltration by lymphocytes, macrophages, multinucleated giant cells, and fewer heterophils. Frequently at the junction of the adipose lobules, there were areas of moderate degeneration and necrosis.

The long smoking history and presence of flattened diaphragms on radiographs are suggestive of COPD. The hallmark of obstructive lung disease is a decreased FEV1 : FVC ratio (to <80%). FEV1 is reduced in patients with COPD because of obstruction. In restrictive lung diseases, FEV1 : FVC is normal or increased.  \n\n【6】Answer B is incorrect. Functional residual capacity (FRC) is increased in COPD because the patient is unable to expire air fully, resulting in air trapping in the lungs. In restrictive lung disease, FRC is decreased because the lung has restricted expansion so all lung volumes are decreased.  \n\n【7】Answer C is incorrect. The total lung capacity in patients with COPD increases. It decreases in patients with restrictive lung disease.  \n\n【8】Answer D is incorrect. COPD has a characteristically decreased FEV1 .  \n\n【9】Answer E is incorrect. Emphysema is an obstructive lung disease, which has a characteristically decreased FEV1 : FVC ratio.

She describes the abdominal pain as sharp and focused in the right epigastric area. She denies vomiting， diarrhea， or constipation. Her typical diet consists of pizza， hot dogs， and salads. Rachel denies any association of her symptoms with food or hunger Her last normal menstrual period was 3 weeks ago， and she has had 2 negative pregnancy tests at home.\n\n【4】Past medical history： She delivered her son 6 months ago vaginally without complications. Her only other medical history includes a kidney infection 4 months ago.\n\n【5】Social history： She smokes 7 cigarettes a day but admits， “I really don’t need them. I am bored.\"Rachel lives with her boyfriend (the father of her child) and his parents. She moved in， far away from her home， only recently. Her parents made her leave their house when she told them she was preg nant， and they have no contact with her. She states that she feels safe at home and is enjoying her baby. Her boyfriend helps with the baby but often goes out at night with his friends and leaves her at home with the baby. She feels a little isolated because everyone works during the day and she has no access to transportation. She is dependent on her in-laws if she needs to go anywhere by car， and they do not often support her need to go anywhere. Otherwise， she walks. She walked here today for her appointment.\n\n【6】Medication： She is not allergic to any medication and only takes birth control pills.\n\n【7】**OBJECTIVE**\n\n【8】Vital signs： Rachel is afebrile. BP is 120/80. Pulse is 68 and regular.\n\n【9】Eyes： PERRLA. EOMs are intact. Optic disks are sharp.\n\n【10】Cardiac： Cardiac exam reveals regular rate and rhythm.\n\n【11】Respiratory： Respirations are 12， steady， and unlabored. Lungs are clear.\n\n【12】Abdomen： Soft with mild tenderness to palpation (TTP) in the RUQ with a negative Murphy's sign. There is no CVA tenderness.\n\n【13】Genitourinary： A urine dipstick reveals positive protein. A urine HCG is negative.\n\n【14】Rachel is diagnosed this first visit with possible cholecystitis and is given Antivert 12.5mg for her nausea. Blood is drawn and sent to the lab. Her urine is sent for analysis， and she is told to return in1 week.\n\n【15】Rachel returns 1 week later. Her blood work reveals fasting blood glucose of 11 mg/dL. Her other blood work is within normal limits. Her urinalysis returns with few bacteria and no protein. Rachel reports that the abdominal pain has worsened and that she now has headaches， as well. She denies a history of migraines or headaches. Her vision is blurry， and she is sensitive to light and sound. Her nausea is still present but decreased.\n\n【16】Her exam remains unchanged.\n\n【17】**CRITICAL THINKING**\n\n【18】**Which diagnostic or imaging studies should be considered to assist with or confirm the diagnosis?**\n\n【19】**Abdominal ultrasound**\n\n【20】**_F_ Abdominal CT scan**\n\n【21】**Head CT scan**\n\n【22】**KUB x-ray**\n\n【23】**\\_\\_CBC**\n\n【24】NMetabolic panel\n\n【25】LFTs\n\n【26】**工Insulin level**\n\n【27】\\_\\_C-peptide\n\n【28】**OGGT**\n\n【29】**Gastrin level**\n\n【30】**What is the most likely differential diagnosis and why?**\n\n【31】**Cholelithiasis**\n\n【32】**Gastroenteritis**\n\n【33】**Diverticulitis**\n\n【34】**Insulin tumor**\n\n【35】**Gastric tumor**\n\n【36】\\_\\_Cholecystitis\n\n【37】**What should be the plan of treatment at this point?**\n\n【38】**Are any referrals needed?**\n\n【39】**Does the patient's home situation influence your plan?**\n\n【40】**RESOLUTION**\n\n【41】Diagnostic Testing： In addition to urine testing， Rachel should have had a metabolic panel， hepatic function panel， and CBC. Once her fasting blood sugar was noted to be 11 mg/dL， a fasting insulin level， c-peptide， and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) should have been ordered. Her first insulin level was 43uIU/mL (normal≤17)， and her c-peptide was 5.1 (normal=0.8-3.1ng/mL). These levels are suspicious for an insulinoma. A gastric tumor must also be ruled out as Rachel has abdominal pain. Therefore， a gastrin level was obtained which was normal. Rachel told the clinician that she\n\n【42】had not eaten when the test was done. It was necessary to repeat this to be sure that Rachel fasted， and the best way to do this was to have these labs repeated just prior to beginning the OGTT which would also support or refute a diagnosis of an insulinoma. Rachel's fasting levels， including the OGTT turned out to be normal， and both an insulin tumor and a gastric tumor were ruled out.\n\n【43】The abdominal pain required an abdominal ultrasound to confirm or rule out cholecystitis or gallstones. When Rachel mentioned the new onset headache， especially accompanied by the visual change， a CT scan of the head was ordered.\n\n【44】Rachel returns in 2 weeks and states that she did not go for the imaging you suggested because of lack of transportation. She is following a low fat diet per your recommendations and her abdominal pain feels slightly better. Now， she denies any headaches， nausea， and dizziness. On exam， she has RUQ TTP and a positive Murphy's sign.\n\n【45】**What is the most likely differential diagnosis and why?**\n\n【46】Rachel most likely has cholecystitis. The positive Murphy's sign with RUQ pain and nausea support the diagnosis. Her fatty diet clearly contributes to her condition， even though she denies any associ-ated pattern with food.\n\n【47】**What should be the plan of treatment at this point?**\n\n【48】Rachel should be assisted to obtain transportation， and the clinician should check if there is a location within walking distance where she can get the tests done. Since Rachel's headaches resolved before she could get the CT scan of her head， it is possible to make a case for holding off on the CT scan (to avoid unnecessary radiation) and instead perform teaching to make Rachel aware of when to go to the emergency room or to report to the clinic if headaches resume.\n\n【49】**Rachel still needs the abdominal ultrasound. She should be asked to return to the clinic to review the results and to review her diet progress. It is also advisable to recommend that Rachel stop smoking for the sake of herself and her babv.**\n\n【50】**Are any referrals needed?**\n\n【51】A referral may be needed to a gastroenterologist to further assess the cholecystitis and to establish a baseline for the condition of the gallbladder as surgical options are considered.\n\n【52】**Does the patient's home situation influence your plan?**\n\n【53】Rachel's home life does play a role in her care. She has trouble getting her in-laws to support her need for transportation or her boyfriend to support her need for socialization. The clinician should coach her and provide support to assist her in helping her in-laws and boyfriend to understand that she needs transportation for her health needs and that of her baby and also to help her make friends in her new location. Rachel is at risk for depression and the consequences of social isolation. This could then put her at high risk for child abuse. The clinician should also offer to speak with the family. It is important that the clinician act as a confidante and support for Rachel while being careful not to malign her family.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Obtaining a thorough psychosocial history.\n\n【3】C. Dix-Hallpike maneuver.\n\n【4】D. Prescribe meclizine.\n\n【5】E. Referral to neurology department.\n\n【6】**Answer**: 60.1 B. This young woman is not describing vertigo. The word “dizzy” can mean several different things, so it is extremely important when obtaining the history to have the patient describe, as best he or she can, what is meant by “dizzy.” Patients with vertigo often use descriptors indicating movement, such as “the room is moving around me” or “I’m on a roller coaster.” Feelings of dysequilibrium, or “out-of-body” experiences such as this young woman describes, are not typical of vertigo and indicate another problem. It would be important to know what the symptoms are associated with; for example, is there increased stress in her job or intimate relationship? Is this panic disorder or anxiety disorder?\n\n【7】**Question**: 60.2 A 75-year-old man presents to the emergency room with the sudden onset of nausea and vomiting. His medical history is notable for coronary artery disease and well-controlled hypertension. On examination he refuses to open his eyes or move his head, but when finally coaxed to sit up, he immediately starts to retch and vomit. Rotational nystagmus is noted. He cannot walk because of the dizziness and nausea that walking evokes. His noncontrast brain CT scan is read as normal for age. Which of the following is the best next step?\n\n【8】A. MRI/magnetic resonance angiography (MRA).\n\n【9】B. Obtain a thorough psychosocial history.\n\n【10】C. Dix-Hallpike maneuver.\n\n【11】D. Prescribe meclizine.\n\n【12】E. Referral to neurology.\n\n【13】**Answer**: 60.2 A. This patient has symptoms of central vertigo. The onset of symptoms was abrupt and severe. His gait is affected. If he were able to cooperate with an examination of his cerebellar functions, it would most likely be abnormal. His age and history of hypertension and coronary artery disease place him at elevated risk for cerebellar infarction or hemorrhage. CT is not the appropriate test for examining the brainstem; MRI is much more accurate. MRA may be useful for delineating the exact vascular cause of the symptoms.\n\n【14】**Question**: 60.3 A 65-year-old woman with a history of benign positional vertigo returns to your office for follow-up. Although manageable, the symptoms of vertigo continue to recur periodically. Between episodes she generally feels normal but occasionally somewhat “off-balance.” Today, her neurologic examination is completely normal, except that the thresholds of both air and bone conduction of a vibrating 256-Hz tuning fork are elevated on the left side. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【15】A. Intermittent benign positional vertigo\n\n【16】B. Otosclerosis\n\n【17】C. Acoustic neuroma\n\n【18】D. Acute basilar artery infarct\n\n【19】E. Panic disorder\n\n【20】**Answer**: 60.3 C. Acoustic neuromas are slow-growing tumors of the eighth cranial nerve. Because of the slow growth of the tumor, the neurologic system often is able to accommodate, so patients may have only subtle symptoms that at first may be confused with benign positional vertigo. The keys in this patient’s history are the persistent low-grade feelings of dysequilibrium and the finding of probable sensorineural hearing loss on the left side. This finding indicates a possible problem with the eighth nerve, and an MRI would best delineate the anatomy.\n\n【21】**Question**: 60.4 Which of the following is the best next step for the patient described in Question 60.3?\n\n【22】A. Prescription for a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor\n\n【23】B. Referral for a hearing aid\n\n【24】C. Lumbar puncture and serology for syphilis\n\n【25】D. Referral for an MRI\n\n【26】E.

The patient was a retired executive. He complained of fever without apparent cause since January 17th, with a maximum temperature of 38ºC, with dry cough, slight chest tightness, and diarrhea. The patient went to Hubei Provincial People’s Hospital for symptomatic treatment (details unknown). After 5 days, the patient perceived no significant relief of symptoms. Then, he went to Union Hospital affiliated to Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology for continuous consultation. Chest X-ray showed “viral pneumonia”. So, he was admitted to hospital. During his hospitalization, he tested probable positive for COVID-19 nucleic acid. His symptoms improved after treatment. He was discharged after 2 COVID-19 nucleic acid tests were negative. Four days after being discharged from the hospital, the patient suddenly developed weakness in both lower limbs, with numbness, pain, and extreme difficulty in walking. He was also experiencing pain in his neck. Then, he was admitted to a hospital in Wuhan. He was diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome after a lumbar puncture and a lumbar and head MRI was done. His symptoms improved slightly after treatment with gamma globulin and hormones. But he still found it hard to walk down the stairs. He needed an aid to walk and had to stop after 10 m. It affected the quality of his life severely. For further diagnosis and treatment, he was transferred to Wuhan Jin Yin Tan Hospital and admitted to the hospital with COVID-19.\n\n【11】Since the onset of the disease, the patient had poor energy, appetite, and sleep. His bowel movements and urine were normal. He had lost some weight. He had a past history of diabetes, hypertension, no history of other specific diseases, no history of surgical trauma, no family history of morbidity, and denied a history of food or drug allergies.\n\n【12】Pre-hospitalization lab result showed the following: biochemistry of CSF showed lactate dehydrogenase was 16 U/L, Chloride was 123.1 mmol/L, protein was 0.56 g/L, glucose was 7.8 mmol/L, and adenosine dehydrogenase was 2 U/L. CSF analysis showed that the CSF was colorless, clear, and coagulant negative, leukocytes in CSF were 1/ul, erythrocytes in CSF were 0/ul, and mononuclear cell or polykaryon was not found. The immunoglobulin G in urine was 105 mg/L.\n\n【13】### Patient’s Condition on Admission\n\n【14】When the patient was admitted to the hospital, his energy and appetite were still good, and he had no fever and cough. He felt shortness of breath after activities, weakness, numbness, and pain in the lower limbs and had difficulty while walking. He had to use assistance tools to walk and needed to stop after walking 10 m. His tongue color was pale with teeth marks and a white coating . He had a slippery pulse.\n\n【15】Figure 2-20-1. Tongue picture on admission.\n\n【16】Physical examination showed the following results: body temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 90 beats per minute, blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, oxygen saturation of 92% while the patient was breathing ambient air, and grade 3 muscle strength in both lower extremities.\n\n【17】### Admission Diagnosis\n\n【18】① COVID-19 (severe type). ② Hypertension. ③ Diabetes. ④ GuillainBarré Syndrome.\n\n【19】### Treatment Plan\n\n【20】The patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 in other hospitals. After conventional treatment by Western medicine, the fever, cough, and other pneumonia-related symptoms gradually subsided. The patient then developed weakness in both lower extremities. He was diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome. The weakness of both lower extremities did not improve significantly after treatment with hormones, gamma globulin, and nourishing nerves.\n\n【21】### Western Medicine Treatment Strategies\n\n【22】通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Combining the history, symptoms (fever, chest tightness, and diarrhea were the main clinical symptoms of COVID-19), and lab result (positive nucleic acid for COVID-19 outside the hospital, inflammatory manifestations on chest images, lumbar puncture and cephalic and lumbar MRI outside the hospital), the diagnosis of COVID-19 and Guillain-Barré syndrome was clear.\n\n【23】通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> The patient was admitted with severe COVID-19 and had significant weakness in both lower extremities, which severely affected his quality of life. That made it difficult for him to use the toilet on his own. He could only defecate at bedside. He had a history of hypertension and diabetes.\n\n【24】通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> The patient had been continuously treated with immuno-impact therapy before coming to our ward. But, he still had obvious weakness in both lower limbs and grade 3 muscle strength in both lower limbs. Treatment was continued with human immunoglobulin and human albumin according to the conditions.\n\n【25】### TCM Treatment Strategies\n\n【26】#### _02/25/2020_\n\n【27】Given the patient’s shortness of breath, weakness and numbness of both lower extremities, pale color of the tongue, greasy white coating, and slippery pulse, the patient was considered to have a deficiency of lower primordial qi, upward disturbance of phlegm-turbidity, and cold-dampness in the lungs. The idea was based on a combination of disease and syndrome, but more focused on disease differentiation. We gave him Xuebijing injection and herbs based on “Dihuang Yinzi”. The herb was as follows:\n\n【28】Shan Yu Rou (Common Macrocarpium Fruit) 10 g, Shu Di (Radix Rehmanniae Preparata) 15 g, Mai Dong (Radix Ophiopogonis) 15 g, Shi Hu (Herba Dendrobii) 20 g, Wu Wei Zi (Fructus Schisandrae Chinensis) 6 g, Rou Cong Rong (Herba Cistanches) 15 g, Ba Ji Tian (Radix Morindae Officinalis) 10 g, Yuan Zhi (Radix Polygalae) 10 g, Shi Chang Pu (Rhizoma Acori Tatarinowii) 10 g, Chi Shao (Paeoniae Radix rubra) 10 g, Sheng Huang Qi (Astragali Radix) 20 g, Jin Yin Hua (Flos Lonicerae) 20 g, Hei Shun Pian (Radix Aconiti Lateralis Preparata) 6 g.\n\n【29】It was given in 3 doses, granules, 1 dose per day, to be taken in the morning and evening.\n\n【30】#### _03/03/2020_\n\n【31】On the 8th day of admission, the patient’s weakness and numbness in both lower extremities were improved markedly after 1 week of herbs. He could move down to the ground a little. His tongue color was red with a white coating and his pulse was slippery . It was considered to be a deficiency of the spleen and qi, dampness disturbance, and stasis of blood, and the lingering evil have not been eliminated. Chinese medicine treatment is based on nourishing yin to dispel evil, clearing heat, removing toxicity, and promoting blood circulation for removing obstruction in the collateral. The herbs we gave him were a modified decoction of “Sishen Jian”. The herb was as follows:\n\n【32】Sheng Huang Qi (Astragali Radix) 50 g, Shi Hu (Herba Dendrobii) 30 g, Yuan Zhi (Radix Polygalae) 10 g, Jin Yin Hua (Flos Lonicerae) 30 g, Xuan Shen (Radix Scrophulariae) 30 g, Sheng Di (Radix Rehmanniae Recens) 15 g, Bai Shao (Radix Paeoniae Alba) 30 g, Sheng Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae Radix) 10 g, Huai Niu Xi (Radix Achyranthis Bidentatae) 15 g, Zhi Mu (Rhizoma Anemarrhenae) 15 g, Mu Gua (Fructus Chaenomelis) 12 g, Bi Xie (Dioscorea septemloba Thunbt) 10 g.\n\n【33】Figure 2-20-2. Tongue picture on March 3rd.\n\n【34】It was given as 3 doses, granules, 1 dose per day, to be taken in the morning and evening.\n\n【35】#### _03/11/2020_\n\n【36】After 8 days of taking the abovementioned traditional Chinese medicine herbs, the patient’s lower limb weakness improved significantly, and he could walk on his own. The muscle strength of both lower limbs was grade 4+. His quality of life improved significantly. His appetite improved, with no other discomfort. His tongue color was normal with a thin white coating , and his pulse was slippery. Multiple nucleic acid viral tests were performed on different days. They were all negative. The CT scan of the lungs showed significant absorption of the inflammation, and all inflammatory markers basically returned to normal. The patient was discharged from the hospital in an improved condition. A follow-up phone call 2 weeks later showed no relapse in his condition.\n\n【37】### Evaluation of Effectiveness\n\n【38】1\\. Changes in the main symptoms: the patient’s weakness and numbness in both lower limbs improved significantly 1 week after admission, and there was no numbness in the lower limbs before discharge. He was ambulatory without shortness of breath and was able to walk without the use of aids.\n\n【39】Figure 2-20-3. Tongue picture on March 11th.\n\n【40】Figure 2-20-4. Chest X-ray on February 26th.\n\n【41】_Note_ : Marking enhancement was visible in both the lungs; the possibility of viral pneumonia was considered.\n\n【42】2\\. Changes in the main body signs: his muscle strength in both lower limbs recovered from grade 3 to grade 4+.\n\n【43】3\\. Chest image changes are shown in Figures 2-20-4 and 2-20-5 .\n\n【44】### Patient’s Condition at Discharge\n\n【45】After treatment, the patient’s lower limb weakness improved significantly, and he could walk on his own. His muscle strength of both lower limbs was 4+. His quality of life improved significantly. His appetite improved, with no other discomfort. His tongue color was normal with a thin white coating. Multiple nucleic acid viral tests were performed on different days. They were all negative. The CT scan of the lungs showed significant absorption of the inflammation, and all inflammatory markers basically returned to normal. The patient was discharged from the hospital in an improved condition.\n\n【46】### Case Analysis\n\n【47】In this case, the patient developed Guillain-Barré syndrome after infection with COVID-19. COVID-19 belongs to the category of “plague” in traditional Chinese medicine. The pathogenesis of the disease is the external invasion of plague qi and toxins. The lung meridians are affected by evil. The healthy qi is in deficiency. The pathological nature of COVID-19 involves dampness, heat, toxicity, deficiency, and blood stasis. Guillain-Barré syndrome belongs to the category of “flaccidity and syncope” in traditional Chinese medicine. According to the _Lei Jing: Ci Si Zhi Bing_ , “Those who are flaccidity and syncope are not able to function normally with their limbs. Doctors should stretch their limbs and take the acupuncture points there. So, the blood and qi become normal and the disease can be cured.” When flaccidity combines with adverse and congestion of blood and qi which are similar to syncope, the main symptom will be weakness of the feet. So, we call that flaccidity and syncope. Volume 6 of _Zhang Shi Yi Tong_ states that the flaccidity and syncope have two types that manifest in weakness of the feet: one belongs to the kidneys and the bladder. In the _Huangdi’s Internal Classic_ , it was stated that “Continued fear will injure the essence qi. And its injury will cause bone soreness and flaccidity and syncope.” This disease is caused by external dampness-heat and toxicity, emotional trauma, diet and tiredness, long-standing sickness and physical deficiency, and injury from falling. Those will result in damage to the five organs, deficiency of blood, essence qi, and fluid, and loss of nourishment. Even those can lead to atrophy of muscles and limbs cannot function.\n\n【48】Figure 2-20-5. CT scan of the chest on March 2nd.\n\n【49】_Note_ : Infectious lesions in the right lung, considered to be viral pneumonia; lymph node calcification in mediastinum and hilum of the left lung; a small amount of calcification of the aorta.\n\n【50】The patient in this case was a senior man. He had a history of diabetes and hypertension. A long-term illness drains the healthy qi of a person. The deficient body suffers from plague qi with various pathogenic factors such as dampness-heat. That leads to disease. The patient’s cough and fever decreased after western medical treatment, but he showed signs of weakness and numbness in his lower extremities. This is the evil being trapped inside, depleting the blood and fluids and further damaging the healthy qi. This causes the plague qi and toxin to be accumulated in the interior. Blood can be concentrated into stasis by heat. Due to the retention of dampness, heat, toxin, and stasis, muscles, tendons, and ligaments lose their nourishment and atrophy.\n\n【51】After the patient was transferred to our ward, we gave him Xuebijing injection to activate blood circulation to dissipate blood stasis and detoxification. The traditional Chinese medicine herb first given to him was the “Dihuang Yinzi”. It was recorded in the _Sheng Ji Zong Lu_ . It is for someone “not able to speak and walk on the lower limbs due to deficiency of kidney qi”. Kidney yin and yang are the foundation of the body of yin and yang. This formula can nourish Kidney Yin and tonify Kidney Yang, which in turn can nourish Yin and tonify Yang of the whole body. The Shi Chang Pu (Rhizoma Acori Tatarinowii) and Yuan Zhi (Radix Polygalae) are for dissipating phlegm for resuscitation in this formula. Chi Shao (Paeoniae Radix rubra), Sheng Huang Qi (Astragali Radix), and Jin Yin Hua (Flos Lonicerae) are added to benefit qi for activating blood circulation and detoxification. Weakness in both lower extremities improved slightly with the herbs. Afterward, a decoction of Sishen was used for strengthening healthy qi and nourishing yin to eliminate pathogenic factor, clearing heat, removing toxicity, activating blood, and removing obstruction in the joint.\n\n【52】Xuan Shen (Radix Scrophulariae), Sheng Di (Radix Rehmanniae Recens), Bai Shao (Radix Paeoniae Alba), Sheng Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae Radix), Zhi Mu (Rhizoma Anemarrhenae), Mu Gua (Fructus Chaenomelis), and Bi Xie (Dioscorea septemloba Thunbt) are for nourishing yin, promoting the production of body fluid, relieving rigidity of the muscles, and activating the collateral. Other traditional Chinese medicine herbs are for invigorating the spleen in this formula. “All the limbs are given qi from the stomach and the qi are not to the meridians. It must rely on the spleen for transportation and transformation. Now the spleen cannot carry its fluid for the stomach. So, the limbs cannot get the qi and fluid. The qi becomes weaker every day. The channels are blocked. The tendons and bones and muscles are unable to produce qi, so they are not functional.”\n\n【53】As the understanding of COVID-19 has evolved, the virus has been found to affect not only the lungs but also the heart, kidneys, liver, and the nervous system. Regarding CNS diseases caused by other coronaviruses, they have been previously reported (including SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43) to cause encephalitis, encephalomyelitis, multiple sclerosis, and encephalopathy. Neurological involvement can lead to a poor prognosis, a worsening of the clinical condition, or rapid death. Therefore, in patients with COVID-19, in addition to respiratory symptoms, close attention should be paid to neurological manifestations.\n\n【54】(Xiaodong Cong, Bin Li, Qing Miao, Ning Wang, Qing Cao)", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

She also \n\n【5】describes intermittent swelling of the hands and feet. Since her early 30s she had experi￾enced pain in her digits on exposure to cold weather. Over the past few months she had \n\n【6】noticed shortness of breath on exertion.\n\n【7】Examination\n\n【8】The skin over her fingers and hands appears oedematous, waxy, shiny, and indurated; \n\n【9】normal skin elasticity has been lost. The distal fingers appear tapered and there is a \n\n【10】small ulcer present on one of her finger pulps . She has periorbital oedema and \n\n【11】evidence of facial telangiectasia. On respiratory examination there are fine inspiratory \n\n【12】crackles in the bilateral lower zone.\n\n【13】Figure 34.1\n\n【14】Questions\n\n【15】• What is the unifying diagnosis?\n\n【16】• Which organs may be involved?\n\n【17】• How should this patient be managed?74\n\n【18】ANSWER 34\n\n【19】This patient was diagnosed with systemic sclerosis, which is a multisystem disease char￾acterized by fibrotic and vascular abnormalities in association with autoimmune changes. \n\n【20】This particularly affects the skin, lungs, heart and gastrointestinal tract.\n\n【21】The earliest skin changes are usually swelling of the hands and feet. Prior to this, how￾ever, patients may describe a long history of Raynaud’s phenomenon, which is char￾acterized by the fingers/toes undergoing a triphasic colour change from pallor (white), \n\n【22】cyansois (blue) and rubor (red) following exposure to the cold. This occurs due to episodes \n\n【23】of vasospasm, which causes peripheral vessels to constrict. \n\n【24】In association with intermittent hand and foot swelling are telangiectasia, which are \n\n【25】visible dilated blood vessels occurring on the hands, face and chest. The hands have a \n\n【26】characteristic appearance as in this patient including thickening of the skin over the fin￾gers, which eventually leads to scarring (sclerosis). Fingers then become spindle-shaped \n\n【27】with tapering, termed sclerodactyly, and feel tight and stiff. Skin tightening can result in \n\n【28】difficulty opening the mouth (microstomia) and a ‘beak-like’ pinched appearance of the \n\n【29】nose. Other late changes include finger pulp ulcers and even loss of digits. \n\n【30】This is a multisystem disorder affecting the gastrointestinal tract including oesopha￾geal reflux, constipation, diarrhoea and malabsorption. Cardiorespiratory involvement \n\n【31】includes pulmonary fibrosis and pericarditis. Renal involvement affects 50 per cent of \n\n【32】patients. Joint and muscle pain occurs along with weakness and limited movement, \n\n【33】resulting in contractures.\n\n【34】The diagnosis is generally made from the patient’s clinical history and examination of the \n\n【35】skin and other organs. Up to 90 per cent of patients have elevated antinuclear antibodies \n\n【36】(ANA). Anticentromere antibodies are characteristic. Scl-70 is unique to systemic sclero￾sis and is more likely to be associated with severe systemic sclerosis involving the lungs. \n\n【37】Management of systemic sclerosis is challenging with as yet no cure. The course of this \n\n【38】disease is progressive. Patients should be advised to keep their hands and feet warm with \n\n【39】special warming gloves and fleecy boots. Vasodilating drugs and calcium channel block￾ing drugs may be beneficial. H2-blockers may reduce the gastrointestinal symptoms. Oral \n\n【40】corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide and tacrolimus may be of benefit for limited periods. \n\n【41】D-penicillamine may also help. Renal disease is the commonest cause of death, followed \n\n【42】by cardiorespiratory disease.\n\n【43】 KEY POINTS\n\n【44】• Systemic sclerosis is a progressive, multisystem autoimmune disease.\n\n【45】• It particularly affects the skin, lungs, heart and gastrointestinal tract.\n\n【46】• There is no cure and so management is with supportive care.75", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

There was no history of tonic-clonic \n\n【5】jerks, frothing at the mouth or tongue bite. On regaining consciousness, the patient \n\n【6】admitted having had two such episodes in the past, one while playing cricket with \n\n【7】his son and the other while changing a flat-tyre of his car. There was no sensation of \n\n【8】palpitation before these syncopal episodes. There was no past history of exertional \n\n【9】chest pain or breathlessness, although at times he did feel light-headed at the \n\n【10】end of the day. He did not suffer from hypertension or diabetes but he did smoke \n\n【11】occasionally and took alcohol over the weekends. His father had passed away due to \n\n【12】sudden cardiac death at the age of 42 and one of his elder cousin brothers was on \n\n【13】treatment for heart disease. \n\n【14】On examination, the patient was not tachypneic and there was no sweating. The \n\n【15】pulse rate was 88 beats/min. and regular, but two distinct peaks were felt in systole. \n\n【16】Vigorous pulsations were seen over the carotid arteries. The BP was 118/78 mm Hg in \n\n【17】the right arm. There was no anemia, cyanosis or sign of congestive heart failure. The \n\n【18】apex beat was forceful and normal in location but two separate impulses were felt \n\n【19】on palpation. The S1\n\n【20】 and S2\n\n【21】 were normal with a prominent S4\n\n【22】 audible in late diastole. \n\n【23】A short systolic murmur was appreciated at the upper left sternal border that peaked \n\n【24】in mid-systole and ended abruptly. There was no ejection click or palpable thrill and \n\n【25】the murmur did not radiate to the neck. The lung fields were clear. \n\n【26】CLINICAL DISCUSSION \n\n【27】From the history and physical examination, this patient had syncope due to left \n\n【28】ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction. The cause of obstruction possibly \n\n【29】had a familial basis. ECG showed tall R waves with T wave inversion, in the lateral \n\n【30】precordial leads, but there was no S-T segment shift or presence of Q waves. The \n\n【31】rhythm was sinus and the Q-T interval was not prolonged. The X-ray chest did not \n\n【32】reveal any cardiomegaly or sign of pulmonary edema. \n\n【33】On ECHO, the left ventricle cavity was small in size with a normal ejection \n\n【34】fraction. There was significant hypertrophy of the left ventricular walls, with \n\n【35】hypertrophy of the interventricular septum (IVS) exceeding that of the LV \n\n【36】posterior wall (LVPW). The anterior mitral leaflet (AML) impinged on the 64 Section 4 The Cardiomyopathies\n\n【37】hypertrophied septum during systole . The aortic valve was structurally \n\n【38】normal. On Doppler, an LV outflow tract gradient was demonstrated, proximal to \n\n【39】the aortic valve. The high velocity jet had a typical concave appearance. On colour \n\n【40】flow mapping, a mitral regurgitation jet was seen entering the left atrium. These \n\n【41】ECHO findings are typical of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM).\n\n【42】In retrospect, there were several pointers towards the diagnosis of HOCM, \n\n【43】in the patient’s history and physical examination. History of syncope with an \n\n【44】ejection systolic murmur raised the possibility of aortic stenosis, but there was \n\n【45】no ejection click, palpable thrill or radiation of murmur to the neck. Moreover \n\n【46】on ECHO, the aortic valve leaflets were structurally normal and the outflow \n\n【47】tract gradient was located proximal to the aortic valve. A positive family history \n\n【48】of sudden cardiac death may be due to congenital channelopathies that cause \n\n【49】ventricular tachyarrhythmias but the patient denied palpitation and the ECG \n\n【50】showed sinus rhythm with a normal Q-T interval and no evidence of WPW \n\n【51】syndrome. Moreover in most channelopathies, the heart is structurally normal. \n\n【52】Atherosclerotic coronary artery disease is a prominent cause of premature \n\n【53】sudden cardiac death which may run in families. However, coronary artery \n\n【54】disease is rarely if ever associated with left ventricular hypertrophy, unless there \n\n【55】is severe hypertension. Syncopal episodes are also uncommon, unless there is \n\n【56】severe calcific aortic stenosis.\n\n【57】A double-peaked radial pulse that consists of a percussion wave and a tidal \n\n【58】wave, is known as pulsus bisferiens. It indicates rapid early ejection of the left \n\n【59】ventricle, followed by slow delayed emptying, after recoil of the vascular bed. \n\n【60】Pulsus bisferiens is typical of HOCM but also occurs in combined aortic valve \n\n【61】disease (stenosis plus regurgitation). The strong and bifid apex beat indicates \n\n【62】forceful atrial contraction preceding ventricular systole. A prominent S4\n\n【63】 sound \n\n【64】in presystole also carries the same significance. These are both clinical signs of \n\n【65】reduced left ventricular compliance due to myocardial hypertrophy. \n\n【66】Figure 14.1: ECHO showing asymmetrical septal hypertrophy \n\n【67】impinging on the left ventricular outflow tract Case 14 Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy 65\n\n【68】Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, \n\n【69】caused by mutation of genes that encode for sarcomere proteins of the cardiac \n\n【70】myocyte. It is characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), systolic anterior \n\n【71】motion (SAM) of the anterior mitral leaflet and dynamic left ventricular outflow \n\n【72】tract obstruction (LVOTO). The left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is typically \n\n【73】(but not exclusively) asymmetrical, involving the septum more than the free wall. \n\n【74】Other causes of LVH such as severe aortic stenosis or uncontrolled hypertension \n\n【75】are typically absent. This asymmetrical septal hypertrophy (ASH) superficially \n\n【76】resembles the LVH observed in athletes. There is associated diastolic dysfunction \n\n【77】of the left ventricle. In a specific variant known as apical cardiomyopathy, there \n\n【78】is prominent hypertrophy of the ventricular apex without outflow obstruction \n\n【79】. The ECG typically shows deep inverted T waves in the precordial leads. \n\n【80】Systolic anterior motion (SAM) of anterior mitral leaflet (AML) is the hallmark \n\n【81】of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). During later part of \n\n【82】systole, the AML moves anteriorly to coapt with the IV septum . This \n\n【83】occurs due to drag or Venturi effect caused by high velocity in the LV outflow tract \n\n【84】(LVOT). SAM occurs during late stage of systole when the LV cavity is smaller and \n\n【85】causes dynamic LVOT obstruction. Therefore, the term hypertrophic obstructive \n\n【86】cardiomyopathy (HOCM) is more appropriate. If no LVOT obstruction is \n\n【87】demonstrable, the terminology used is non-obstructive idiopathic hypertrophic \n\n【88】subaortic stenosis (IHSS). \n\n【89】Figure 14.3: ECHO showing systolic anterior motion of anterior mitral leaflet\n\n【90】Figure 14.2: ECHO showing isolated hypertrophy \n\n【91】of the left ventricular apex 66 Section 4 The Cardiomyopathies\n\n【92】LVOT obstruction may be present at rest or become more pronounced after \n\n【93】provocation. Provocation is provided by prolonged standing, Valsalva manoeuvre \n\n【94】or giving sublingual nitrate. All these methods reduce left ventricular size and \n\n【95】therefore increase the likelihood of LVOT obstruction. Conversely, squatting and \n\n【96】isometric exercise such as hand-grip, increase left ventricular size and reduce the \n\n【97】degree of LVOT obstruction. \n\n【98】MANAGEMENT ISSUES \n\n【99】The goals of treatment in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are to control symptoms \n\n【100】and to prevent sudden cardiac death (SCD). Symptoms include exertional \n\n【101】dyspnea, typical or atypical angina, palpitations and syncope. Exertional \n\n【102】symptoms are generally because of left ventricular hypertrophy with diastolic \n\n【103】dysfunction and sometimes due to associated mitral regurgitation. Syncopal \n\n【104】episodes are generally related to outflow tract obstruction and sometimes due to \n\n【105】tachyarrhythmias. Patients should be advised to avoid strenuous exercise such as \n\n【106】weight-lifting and not to participate in competitive sports. \n\n【107】Beta-blockers are the agents of first choice. They control heart rate, improve \n\n【108】diastolic filling and reduce the outflow tract gradient. Calcium-channel blockers \n\n【109】like verapamil are preferable, if beta-blockers are contraindicated. These agents \n\n【110】are also used for rate-control if atrial fibrillation exists, although rhythm-control \n\n【111】with amiodarone is preferable. This is because the loss of atrial contribution to \n\n【112】ventricular filling, is often associated with clinical deterioration. All patients \n\n【113】in atrial fibrillation should also receive an anticoagulant to reduce the risk of \n\n【114】thromboembolism. Digitalis, diuretics and vasodilators should be avoided.\n\n【115】If the patient is symptomatic and refractory to medical treatment, surgical \n\n【116】myomectomy is offered to relieve the outflow obstruction. In a patient who is \n\n【117】at high-risk to undergo a surgical procedure, alcohol septal ablation can be \n\n【118】performed by the percutaneous route. An injection of ethanol is given into one \n\n【119】of the septal perforator branches to create an area of myocardial infarction and \n\n【120】thereby widen the narrow outflow tract. \n\n【121】Sudden cardiac death (SCD) can be prevented by using an implantable \n\n【122】cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), in selected high-risk candidates. These subjects \n\n【123】are selected on the basis of identified risk factors for SCD. Risk factors include \n\n【124】septal thickness >25 mm, outflow tract gradient >30 mm Hg, non-sustained \n\n【125】ventricular tachycardia on 48 hour ambulatory Holter monitoring, history of \n\n【126】recurrent syncope and atleast 1 SCD in a relative aged <45 years. \n\n【127】RECENT ADVANCES \n\n【128】Recently, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used to identify \n\n【129】myocardial fibre disarray, as a risk factor for ventricular arrhythmias. Those \n\n【130】subjects with this demonstrable abnormality should be candidates for implantable \n\n【131】cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), to prevent sudden cardiac death (SCD). Alcohol \n\n【132】septal ablation as an interventional strategy, has gained popularity.

Acetazolamide can be taken prophylactically or to alleviate symptoms of acute mountain sickness. It acts by inhibiting carbonic anhydrase, which is important for bicarbonate reabsorption in the proximal tubule of the kidney. This leads to alkalinization of the urine and a metabolic acidosis. The drop in the plasma pH results in an increased breathing drive and higher oxygen levels in the body, helping to reverse the effects of hypoxemia. Acetazolamide should be avoided in patients with an allergy to sulfa drugs.  \n\n【7】Answer A is incorrect . Acetazolamide does not cause a mixed metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis. This combination can be seen with aspirin toxicity, but respiratory alkalosis is not an effect of acetazolamide.  \n\n【8】Answer C is incorrect . Acetazolamide does not cause metabolic alkalosis. Loop diuretics and thiazides both cause metabolic alkalosis. Furosemide is the opposite of acetazolamide in that it lowers urine pH and raises blood pH.  \n\n【9】Answer D is incorrect . Acetazolamide does not cause respiratory acidosis. Respiratory acidosis results from impaired respiration and can be seen with COPD, sedatives/opiates, pneumothorax, acute respiratory distress syndrome, etc.  \n\n【10】Answer E is incorrect .

The supraspinatus muscle is the most frequently injured rotator cuff muscle. Patients often report pain anteriorly and superiorly to the glenohumeral joint during abduction. The primary motion of the supraspinatus is the first 15 degrees of abduction of the arm, at which point the deltoid muscle continues the motion of abduction. Therefore, as long as a patient can assist the injured rotator cuff at the beginning of abduction, he or she will be able to continue the motion unassisted thereafter. This muscle and its tendon can be torn traumatically, but it is most often injured in a more insidious manner because of repetitive movement, as is the likely cause in this case.  \n\n【7】Answer A is incorrect . The deltoid muscle takes over for the supraspinatus muscle in abduction of the arm after about 15 degrees of abduction. The deltoid muscle is not injured in this case, as demonstrated by the patient’s ability to initiate the lift motion by lifting the arm on the injured side with his other arm and then continue the motion unassisted.  \n\n【8】Answer B is incorrect . The action of the infraspinatus muscle is to laterally rotate the arm.  \n\n【9】Answer C is incorrect . The subscapularis is responsible for medial rotation and adduction of the arm.  \n\n【10】Answer E is incorrect .

The initial management of this patient should \n\n【26】follow standard trauma guidelines. Assessment should start with a top-down approach and \n\n【27】you should assess for concurrent head and neck injury. A fall from standing can result in \n\n【28】occult cervical spine fractures. If there is any doubt, then the patient should be immobilised \n\n【29】and imaged to exclude injury. CT is the preferred imaging modality as plain radiographs may \n\n【30】be hard to interpret in the context of degenerative disease.\n\n【31】This woman is noted to be in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate and has a low￾grade fever. Common sources of sepsis in older patients are the chest and urinary tract. \n\n【32】Antibiotics should be provided after screening for infection and the appropriate samples \n\n【33】taken. With regards to the atrial fibrillation, this may be driven by the sepsis or represent a \n\n【34】new acute coronary syndrome. Serial 12-lead ECGs should be performed and troponin test￾ing considered in this context. Rate control may be needed if the patient does not respond \n\n【35】to fluid therapy and antibiotics. Rhabdomyolysis is another consideration as this patient was \n\n【36】also found on the floor with a potential long lie overnight. Creatine kinase should be sent \n\n【37】from the ED and the urine tested for myoglobinuria.\n\n【38】Titrated parenteral opioids (morphine) should be given early to these patients as this will \n\n【39】help in transferring patients onto hospital beds, removing clothes and obtaining adequate \n\n【40】radiographs. Once fracture has been confirmed, regional blockade in the form of a femoral \n\n【41】nerve block or a fascia iliaca block may be instilled in the ED under ultrasound guidance and \n\n【42】is now a widely accepted standard of care.\n\n【43】Most hospitals have a dedicated care pathway for elderly patients with hip fractures. It provides \n\n【44】a standardised care bundle with specific goals including timely initial analgesia, radiographs, \n\n【45】a checklist of blood investigations, urinary catheter insertion, skin checks, pressure-relieving \n\n【46】mattresses, post-operative thromboprophylaxis and rehabilitation goals.\n\n【47】Assessment of these patients is multidisciplinary with co-assessment by an ortho-geriatrician \n\n【48】being the norm. They provide expertise in rationalising medications, secondary bone protec￾tion therapy and guide rehabilitation, which may be prolonged in the context of frailty.\n\n【49】Operative fixation depends on the type of fracture. Hip fractures are divided into two main \n\n【50】groups: intra- and extracapsular. Intracapsular fractures encompass any fracture to the fem￾oral neck (subcapital, transcervical, basicervical), while extracapsular fractures lie at the level \n\n【51】of the trochanteric line or below (intertrochanteric, subtrochanteric).\n\n【52】Within the joint capsule run the retinacular vessels, which are responsible for the major￾ity of the blood supply to the femoral head. They are disrupted in intracapsular hip frac￾tures, and the viability of the femoral head is threatened. Intracapsular fractures are usually \n\n【53】treated with a hemiarthroplasty, especially in older patients. The damaged neck is excised in \n\n【54】a theatre, and a titanium prosthesis is inserted into the proximal femur. The patient is imme￾diately mobilised post-operatively to allow the metal work to embed.\n\n【55】Intertrochanteric fractures are the most common type of extracapsular fracture. The fracture \n\n【56】is reduced in a theatre under fluoroscopic control on a traction table and fixed with a dynamic \n\n【57】hip screw (DHS). This consists of a plate that is fixed to the proximal femur and a sliding screw \n\n【58】that is passed along the neck of the femur into the femoral head. The patient is then mobilised \n\n【59】post-operatively, which allows compression of the fracture and healing to occur.183\n\n【60】Case 52: Unable to stand after a fall\n\n【61】Operative decision-making needs to consider the premorbid status of the patient and their \n\n【62】ability to cope with the stress of anaesthesia as well as the individual fracture pattern. Should \n\n【63】the operative risk be very high, the surgeon may elect to excise the fractured bone and let the \n\n【64】hip joint form a pseudo-arthrosis. This is known as the Girdlestone–Taylor procedure.\n\n【65】Key Points\n\n【66】• Assessment of the elderly patient with a hip fracture should follow standard \n\n【67】trauma guidelines.\n\n【68】• Look for and treat medical causes such as sepsis, delirium and acute coronary \n\n【69】events as part of the pre-operative work up.\n\n【70】• Give early analgesia and consider local regional blockade as the gold standard of \n\n【71】care.\n\n【72】• Operative fixation depends on the age of the patient and the type of fracture.http://taylorandfrancis.com185", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

On questioning, the man reports that in recent months he has felt very fatigued and has been bothered by constant dull pain in his hips, back, and head. A radiograph of his skull is shown in the image. Laboratory studies show a serum calcium of 13.5 mg/dL and alkaline phosphatase of 60 U/L.

This patient is suffering from multiple myeloma. The x-ray shows multiple lytic “punched out” lesions in the skull, which is a classic finding for this plasma cell malignancy. Other areas of the skeleton commonly infiltrated by myeloma cells include the vertebrae, ribs, and pelvis, explaining the patient’s fracture in the absence of overt trauma. The lytic bone lesions are responsible for this patient’s hypercalcemia in the setting of normal alkaline phosphatase levels. Urinary protein (termed Bence-Jones proteins in this setting) is a common finding in multiple myeloma because the neoplastic plasma cells secrete an abundance of immunoglobulin proteins, with the light chains readily excreted. Excessive serum levels of immunoglobulin can lead to nephropathy or amyloidosis in these patients.  \n\n【8】Answer A is incorrect . Osteogenesis imperfecta results from a defect in the synthesis of collagen I and leaves patients susceptible to pathologic fractures. In addition to brittle bones, insufficient collagen I can lead to abnormal dentition, conductive hearing loss, and a bluish hue in the sclera. However, this disease does not first present in late adulthood, and would not be associated with lytic bone lesions.  \n\n【9】Answer B is incorrect . This is a description of Chvostek sign, which is a manifestation of neuromuscular hyperexcitability. This would be expected in a person with symptomatic hypocalcemia, not in a patient with hypercalcemia.  \n\n【10】Answer C is incorrect . Although adenocarcinoma of the prostate commonly metastasizes to bone, it is an unlikely cause of this patient’s symptoms. Bone metastases from the prostate tend to produce dense and sclerotic osteoblastic bone lesions, rather than the lytic lesions seen on the radiograph. Moreover, one would expect an elevated alkaline phosphatase level in the setting of osteoblastic metastases.  \n\n【11】Answer D is incorrect . Parathyroid adenomas are a common cause of hyperparathyroidism and consequent hypercalcemia. However, alkaline phosphatase levels should be markedly elevated in hyperparathyroidism. Moreover, parathyroid neoplasms are rarely malignant, and widespread skeletal metastases would not be expected in a patient with a parathyroid adenoma.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

At a visit to a local emergency room， they were told it was \"staph\" infection， and cephalexin and trimetho-prim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) were prescribed. Initially she improved. However， on return home from the trip， she was taken to see a local pediatrician when a nodule developed at the angle of the jaw. Her temperature was 100.9°F.\n\n【3】She was subsequently admitted to the hospital for 5 days from 4/8 to4/13/09 for incision and drainage (I6D) of a right submandibular node(a 2 cm area of abscess near the angle of jaw) that did not eventually grow in culture. No histopathologic studies were done on that specimen. A single blood culture drawn on that admission was negative. She received clindamycin and TMP-SMX. During outpatient follow-up on 5/4/09， a new nodule had developed on the right neck， proximal to the old site. Amoxicillin/clavulanate was prescribed， and a TB skin test (PPD) was applied； it was later read as negative. Chest x-ray showed some perihilar markings and with the presence of cough， the possibility of bronchiolitis or pneumonia was raised. An additional antibiotic， azithromycin， was prescribed.\n\n【4】The mother sought a second opinion because the neck nodes and swelling were persisting. A second PPD skin test was applied， described as suspiciously positive， and the patient was admitted on 5/13/09.\n\n【5】Infectious diseases consult was placed on 5/13/09 for help in addressing the cervical lymphadenopathy and the suspected positive PPD skin test.\n\n【6】Review of systems was significant for a relatively healthy-looking child， with no weight loss. She was comfortable as long as the neck was not examined. Her appetite and general well-being were normal. There was no high spiking fever reported. She had no known drug allergies.\n\n【7】Cases in Clinical Infectious Disease Practice： Obtaining a Good History from the Patient Remains the Cornerstone ofan Accurate Clinical Diagnosis： Lessons Learned in Many Years ofClinical Practice， **First Edition.

Published 2016 by John Wiley & Sons， Inc.\n\n【9】The past medical history was significant for a flat congenital hemangioma at the posterior neck area， frequent ear infections in the past， and a recent cough for which chest x-rays were done on 5/4 and 5/11/09.Other history is as noted above. She was said to be up to date on her immunizations.\n\n【10】Epidemiologic history was significant for the following： she was an only child， living with her young parents. Recently， at the time of the initial neck swelling in March， she had been traveling with the parents across the States (father was a truck driver) for about 2 months. However， they slept and cooked in the truck， ate nothing unusual， and did not sleep in hotels. She had no cat bites or scratch； she had in fact no animals or contact with animals. There was no one in the fam-ily with known tuberculosis (TB) or contact to TB， including the grandparents. There was no ingestion of unpasteurized milk or dairy products. There was no report of any dental problem or recent surgical procedure.\n\n【11】On examination， she was alert and well oriented， and not in acute distress. Vital signs were as follows： blood pressure (BP) 110/55， respiratory rate (RR) 28， heart rate (HR) 132， and temperature 99.8°F； height 2'8\"， weight 24.4 pounds. Head and neck exam showed no jaundice or conjunctivitis. The oropharynx was only partially examined due to poor co-operation， but there was no obvious mucosal or dental abnormality noted. The left neck was unremarkable， while the right neck showed an old healed scar/scab at the angle of the jaw (previous surgery site on 4/8/09)， and a slightly red， non-adherent nodule above the old surgical site. The heart， lung， abdominal， external genitalia， and lower extremi-ties were normal. The right arm had a peripheral intravenous line in place while the left arm showed several punctate lesions， apparently reflecting the two recent PPD skin tests placed in the previous week， and 2 days prior to admission. Neu-rologic examination was normal， except for irritable cry when the right neck was examined. The skin showed a flat congenital hemangioma at the nape or back of the neck， but no rash or other changes， except at the right neck， as shown in Fig. 13.1a.\n\n【12】_· What are the differential diagnoses that come to mind with this history and picture?_\n\n【13】**Laboratory and radiologic findings**\n\n【14】The chest x-rays done before admission on 5/4 and 5/11/09 showed perihilar markings in the first x-ray that were largely resolved on 5/11/09. Computed tomography (CT) scan and ultrasound of the neck done on 5/11/09 con-firmed prominent lymph nodes in the right neck region， and a 1.2 × 2.3 cm rim-enhancing， low-density collection in the soft tissue suggestive of abscess. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate on various occasions in April and May was normal， ranging between 0 and 4 mm/hour. On 5/11/09， the complete blood count (CBC) showed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 10.4， hemoglobin and hematocrit (H/H) 12.5 and 37.7， respectively， mean corpuscular volume(MCV) 82.5， and platelet count 368，000. The differential count showed 33.7%\n\n【15】Figure 13.1a Right cervical lymphadenitis.

Chemistries showed generally normal values： sodium140， potassium 4.3， glucose 100 mg/dL， blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine9/0.4， respectively； serumglutamic oxaloacetic transaminase((SGOT)41 _._ serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) 15， albumin 3.4， and alkaline phosphatase 211. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was elevated at 331(normal98-192 IU/L).\n\n【17】**Hospital course and subsequent events**\n\n【18】The infectious diseases consultant recommended excisional biopsy of the right cervical lymph nodes， in view of the differential diagnoses considered in this sta-ble patient. This procedure was carried out by the surgeon on 5/14/09. At surgery， a 2.5×1.5 cm neck mass (with caseating purulence) was excised. Multiple stains and microbiologic cultures were performed.\n\n【19】_·What do you think the histopathology later showed?_\n\n【20】A lumbar puncture was done showing normal or negative findings. The second PPD skin test was read as likely postive at about 10 mm induration， although the technique of the application was questionable. Blood was sent off for QuantiFERON-TB Gold test， to address the questionable PPD result. The patient remained clinically stable. A graphic display of the vital signs during the hospital admission (5/13-5/18/09) is shown in Fig. 13.1b.\n\n【21】The results of the histopathology on the neck mass were available 24 hours after the biopsy. They showed marked chronic granulomatous inflammation with giant cells and necrosis. Acid-fast bacilli (AFB) were also identified on special stains. No fungal elements were noted on the Grocott's methenamine silver (GMS) stain. The culture results were still pending at this time. The QuantiFERON-TB Gold test and the final culture report of the node would become available only after the patient was discharged home to outpatient follow-up.\n\n【22】Figure 13.1b Graphic display of vital signs (hospital admission) between 5/13 and 5/17/09.\n\n【23】_·Based on the available data， can you hazard a guess as to the likely diagnosis?_\n\n【24】A presumptive diagnosis was made， and treatment recommendations made to the attending physician.\n\n【25】**Follow-up and additional comments**\n\n【26】This patient was clinically stable， with no significant systemic complaints. She was sensitive to touch or examination of the right neck， but otherwise was well， had no fever or weight loss， and was eating and playing well for a now18-month-old child. She had already been through two surgeries， and was understandably sensitive.\n\n【27】The excisional biopsy had yielded useful data， and the clinical diagnosis had been substantiated， even though the final node culture report was still pending. Two options were given to the attending physician： do close follow-up in the outpatient setting on no specific antimicrobial therapy， or begin empiric medical therapy while awaiting the final culture result of the node biopsy. The attending physician chose to begin empiric antimicrobial therapy.\n\n【28】Over the next year， the patient was seen several times in the outpatient set-ting by the attending physician for other issues but did not require any more in-hospital admissions. Multiple other tests， including CT of the head， serolo-gies to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)， cat scratch disease (CSD)， antistreptolysin O(ASO)， Monospot， HlV， and C-reactive protein， were all negative. She is said to be doing well， and is fully recovered. The family was screened by the local health department authorities. No TB was found.\n\n【29】**Additional laboratory results**\n\n【30】The QuantiFERON-TB Gold test was reported positive the week after discharge (a\n\n【31】send-out test). The tissue culture was reported positive for AFB within 19 days.\n\n【32】The specimen was then sent off to a reference laboratory for Gen probe， to rule out M. tuberculosis， and to perform antimycobacterial sensitivity testing.\n\n【33】_·What is your diagnosis now?_\n\n【34】**Case discussion**\n\n【35】This patient presented with the classic features of chronic cervical lymphadenitis in children. The symptoms lingered for over 2 months before a final diagnosis was made. She was seen initially in March (out of state) for what was clearly not a true\"staph\" infection， and then required two further admissions for resolution of her problems. The first biopsy was an incision and drainage procedure， which was not curative because she relapsed. During the second admission， we suggested an excisional biopsy， which we think was curative.\n\n【36】The organism finally identified and confirmed by Gen probe was Mycobac-terium avium-intracellulare complex (MAI)， a non-tuberculous mycobacterium(NTM). This was not a surprise diagnosis in this patient， given her relative well-being and the clinical presentation and history.\n\n【37】Infectious causes of cervical lymphadenitis are divided into four general groups： acute unilateral， chronic unilateral， acute bilateral and chronic bilateral\\[1，2\\]. The patient presented here would be classified as being in the chronic unilateral group. The most common causes under this group include NTM (also called mycobacteria other than tuberculosis or MOTT)， tuberculosis (M. tuber-culosis)， and cat scratch disease \\[1，2\\]. Of course， there are many non-infectious causes of cervical adenopathy， but these will not be discussed here.\n\n【38】The epidemiology， history， and physical examination in this patient clearly favored NTM as the cause of the chronic adenopathy. For that reason， the infectious disease recommendation was for excisional biopsy， which is usually curative (96% in one report) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>， as opposed to medical treatment alone (66%)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. We did not recommend incision and drainage because of suppuration and sinus tracts that can develop and persist in non-excised lymph nodes， as a complication.\n\n【39】As it turned out， the antimicrobial therapy started presumptively by the attending physician was likely ineffective (since the NTM \\[MAI\\] was resistant to those agents： isoniazid， rifampin plus pyrazinamide， which was not on the panel). Clarithromycin was found to be a sensitive agent against this NTM. A typical presumptive therapy for NTM cervical adenitis (targeted at MAI) usually includes clarithromycin and ethambutol； both were sensitive agents in this patient.\n\n【40】The usefulness and interpretation of the new QuantiFERON-TB Gold test in children less than 5 years have not yet been defined 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. However， the smaller\n\n【41】induration of the PPD skin test would be compatible in children with an infection with NTM， typically 5-15 mm， as in this setting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The patient had an induration of about 10 mm with the second PPD skin test.\n\n【42】_· Final diagnosis： Subacute/chronic cervical lymphadenitis secondary to non-tuberculous_ _mycobacterial (NTM) infection (specifically， MAI complex)._\n\n【43】**Lessons learned from this case**\n\n【44】· The importance of differentiating between the various categories of infectious cervical adenitis， especially in children， as this has clinical and therapeutic implications (acute， bilateral， chronic， and unilateral).\n\n【45】· The preference is for excisional biopsy rather than incision and drainage in addressing chronic cervical adenitis in well children (in this patient， the initial I6D did not lead to a cure， but instead to a recurrence).\n\n【46】· The relative well-being of the patient was a clue that the likely cause was a NTM， as opposed to M. tuberculosis.\n\n【47】·The lack of response to multiple antibiotic courses was another clue that this was not a simple acute pyogenic infection， and an indication for excisional biopsy.\n\n【48】· As in this case， it is important to do histopathologic analysis on any excised lymph node (this was not done during the first admission).\n\n【49】· In a young child especially， NTM (MAI or scrofula) is an important differential in subacute/chronic， unilateral cervical adenitis (in adults， M. tuberculosis may be more common).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

In addition，the intestinal edema associated with his resuscitation may contribute to impaired intestinal motility and absorption.\n\n【8】Factors contributing to increased nutritional requirements： Hypermetabo-lism and increased catabolism from his pancreatitis will contribute to marked increase in amino acid requirement and decreased ability to utilize glucose.\n\n【9】**ANALYSIS**\n\n【10】_Objectives_\n\n【11】1\\. To learn the approaches to nutritional assessments and strategies of monitoring responses to nutritional support.\n\n【12】2\\. To learn the nutritional management of patients with pancreatitis and renal insufficiency (with and without concurrent hemodialysis).\n\n【13】3.To learn the principles of nutritional support specifically designed for the modu-lation of host inflammatory and immune responses.\n\n【14】**_Considerations_**\n\n【15】This is a 46-year-old man who has been in the hospital for 4 days. The severe inflam-matory response in pancreatitis can generate large fluid shifts between the intravas-cular and extravascular space leading to hemodynamic instability as well as edema and respiratory failure. Patients with severe pancreatitis require aggressive fluid resuscitation to maintain adequate intravascular volume to support end-organ perfu-sion. This patient’s hypotension did not respond initially to fluid resuscitation alone and required pressor support， but now his BP has improved. Typically， these patients will have large net positive fluid balance， to which the lungs are most sensitive， especially in the setting of ARDS. This type of lung injury requires prolonged mechanical respiratory support beyond the initial resuscitation phase. In addition， his initial hypotension may have decreased his end-organ perfusion， which can lead to acute kidney injury. This patient’s source of acute pancreatitis is unknown， but\n\n【16】based on statistics， alcoholic pancreatitis is highly probable. If his pancreatitis is due to alcohol， he may also have a poor baseline nutritional status due to chronic excess alcohol consumption. Additionally， he mayhave deficiencies that would ben-efit from specific vitamin and mineral supplementation in addition to caloric and pro-tein provision. Enteral nutritional support will target the delivery of 25 to 30 kcal/kg of nonprotein calories and 1.5 to 2.0 g/kg of proteins per day. Close monitoring to avoid hyperglycemia (glucose >140-160) should be implemented. Similarly， if nasogastric feeding is initiated， the patient should be closely monitored for signs of intolerance such as abdominal distension， and/or high gastric residual volumes(>500 mL).\n\n【17】**APPROACH TO：**\n\n【18】**Nutritional Issues in the ICU**\n\n【19】**DEFINITIONS**\n\n【20】ENTERAL NUTRITION： Nutrition provided through the gastrointestinal tract via a tube， catheter， or stoma that delivers nutrients distal to the oral cavity.\n\n【21】**PARENTERAL NUTRITION： The intravenous administration of nutrition， either via central or peripheral access.**\n\n【22】PROTEIN-CALORIE MALNUTRITION： A recent weight loss of >10% to15% or actual body weight <90% of ideal body weight.\n\n【23】TROPHIC FEEDING： Low-volume enteral feeding (usually 10-30 mL/h) meant to prevent mucosal atrophy but insufficient to provide adequate calorie and protein requirements.\n\n【24】**CLINICAL APPROACH**\n\n【25】Critical illness is associated with a catabolic response because of changes in the hor-monal milieu related to cytokine responses that occur following major physiological insults. The increased metabolic response continues into a later anabolic phase of tissue healing. Both of these increase the patient's nutritional requirements. The goals of nutrition therapy are to modify (most cases down-regulate) the metabolic response to stress， to prevent oxidative cellular injury， and to up-regulate the host immune responses. Initiation of early nutritional support， primarily enteral nutrition， is a proactive strategy directed at reducing some of the deleterious effects produced by the host's hypermetabolic responses， which in turn should reduce com-plications， ICU length of stay， and mortality.\n\n【26】In the majority of critically ill patients， it is practical， safe， and less expensive to utilize enteral nutrition over parenteral nutrition. Results from the various clinical trials comparing enteral versus parenteral nutrition in critically ill patients have shown that enteral nutrition is associated with the reduction in infectious compli-cations， specifically central-line infections and pneumonia. Enteral nutrition is also associated with cost savings from reduced adverse events and savings from reduced hospital length ofstay. It appears that critically ill ICU patients with hemodynamic\n\n【27】**compromise and requiring high doses of vasoactive agents and large volume of blood products may have an increased risk of intolerance to enteral nutritional support and increased risk of gut-related complications. Therefore， it is generally advisable to withhold enteral feeding until the patients are fully resuscitated.**\n\n【28】Enteral nutrition utilizes the gut barrier to control water and electrolyte absorp-tion. It also supports the functional integrity of the gut by maintaining tight junc-tions between the intraepithelial cells， stimulating blood flow， and inducing the release of trophic endogenous agents (ie， cholecystokinin， gastrin， bombesin， and bile salts). Furthermore， the structural integrity of the gut， including villous height and mass of secretory IgA-producing immunocytes， is better maintained with enteral nutrition. Loss of functional integrity can adversely affect gut permeability produc-ing increase in bacterial challenge， perpetuation of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)， increase in the risk for systemic infection， and increase in the likelihood of multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS) development.\n\n【29】In a previously healthy patient with no evidence of malnutrition， the use of parenteral nutrition may be withheld until after 7 to 10 days of hospitalization without nutrition. This is mostly due to concerns with infectious complications associated with parenteral nutrition. If， however， there is preexisting protein-calorie malnutrition and enteral nutrition support is not feasible， it is appropriate to initi-ate parenteral nutrition much earlier after adequate resuscitation has taken place. Parenteral nutrition is indicated primarily for patients in whom enteral nutrition is not feasible or not tolerated， and in severely malnourished patients who are about to undergo major upper GI surgery.\n\n【30】Initiating nutritional therapy first requires an assessment of the patient's nutritional status by determining weight loss and previous nutrient intake prior to admission， level of disease severity， comorbid conditions， and function of the gastrointestinal(GI) tract. Estimates of calorie requirement of the patient’s basic metabolic rate is done with the Harris-Benedict equation. This can also be measured via indirect calorimetry with the aid of a respiratory therapist. Protein requirements are estimated from the patient's degree of illness and monitored with 24-hour nitrogen-balance measurements. Traditional markers (albumin， pre-albumin， transferrin， retinol-binding protein) are a reflection of the acute phase response and do not accurately represent nutrition status in the ICU patient. These markers by themselves have too low specificity， but may， together along with body weight changes， provide an estimate of general nutrition status.\n\n【31】Enteral nutrition should be started within 24 to 48 hours following admission， or as soon as fluid resuscitation is completed and the patient is hemodynamically stable. Feeding started within this time frame is associated with less gut permeability and diminished activation and release of inflammatory cytokines； early enteral feed-ing has also been shown to reduce infectious morbidity and hospital length of stay. Either gastric or small bowel feeding is acceptable in the ICU patient but small bowel is preferable in patients with high risk of aspiration and patients with severe brain injury (intracranial hypertension is associated with decreased gastric emptying).\n\n【32】The use of“trickle”or trophic feeds may prevent mucosal atrophy， but has not been shown to improve outcomes from the standpoint of immune modulation. Feed-ings should be increased toward goal or at least to >50% to 65% of caloric goal over\n\n【33】the first 48 to 72 hours following initiation for maximal benefits. Gastric residuals<500 mL in the absence of other signs of intolerance are acceptable and do not increase the risk of aspiration or pneumonia. In critically ill patients， protein is the most important macronutrient for supporting immune function and wound healing. Assessment of the adequacy of protein nutrition is estimated from nitrogen balance (needs to be 1.2-2.0 g/kg/d) or nonprotein calorie：nitrogen ratio (70：1 to100：1). Phosphate levels should be monitored closely and replaced when needed in respiratory failure patients for optimal pulmonary function.\n\n【34】Many enteral formulations are available to meet the needs of different patients. In patients with ARDS or lung injury， enteral formulations characterized by an anti-inflammatory lipid profile and antioxidants should be used (ie， omega-3 fish oils， borage oil) for they have been shown to reduce ICU length of stay， duration of mechanical ventilation， organ failure， and mortality. Patients with respiratory fail-ure can receive calorically dense formulations if fluid restriction is needed. Antioxi-dant vitamins (including vitamin E and ascorbic acid) and trace minerals (including selenium， zinc， and copper) may also improve ICU patient outcomes. Thiamine and folate supplementation for individuals with history of chronic alcohol abuse is important. Formulations with low glucose concentrations are available for diabetics as well to improve glycemic control.\n\n【35】Special considerations regarding enteral nutrition should be made for patients with renal failure. Acute kidney injury (AKI) usually develops in the setting of multiple organ failure in the critically ill individual. These patients also require the standard enteral formulations described previously with continued adherence to the protein and calorie provisions as before. If significant electrolyte abnormalities develop， formulations with appropriate electrolyte profiles may be considered. In AKI patients receiving renal replacement therapy (RRT)， increased protein pro vision should be considered. RRT results in amino acid loss of approximately 10to 20 g/d depending on the method， length of time， and type of filters used. These patients require formulations with 1.5 to 2.0 g/kg/d of protein， and some studies suggesting as high as 2.5 g/kg/d of protein to preserve a positive nitrogen balance.\n\n【36】Patients with severe acute pancreatitis should have a nasogastric (NG) tube placed on admission and enteral nutrition started as soon as fluid volume resuscitation is com~plete. Three meta analyses showed that use of enteral nutrition compared to paren teral nutrition reduces infectious morbidity， hospital length of stay， need for surgical interventions， multiple organ failure， and mortality. Outcome benefits are seen in patients with acute pancreatitis when enteral nutrition is initiated within 24 to 48hours. There has been no significant difference seen in outcomes of feeding by the gastric versus jejunal route； however， jejunal feeding may be better tolerated in these patients as severe pancreatitis can be associated with poor gastric emptying. To improve tolerance to enteral nutrition higher in the GI tract， low-fat elemental formulations in continuous infusion rather than bolus feeding should be used.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Ifone element of the trimer is mutant， the trimer is rendered ineffective and cannot deliver the signal to down-stream elements of the pathway that ultimately cause cell death. This type of effect is called a dominant-negative effect.\n\n【8】**Answer 2**\n\n【9】Some family members， even though they show no clinical evidence of ALPS， will show impaired lymphocyte apoptosis in vitro. It is clear that environmental and/or other genetic factors have a role in the full expression of the ALPS phenotypes as in other genetically inherited diseases. This is called variable expressivity.\n\n【10】**Answer 3**\n\n【11】Vaccinia (the virus used for smallpox vaccination) expresses a protein， Crm A， that inhibits caspases. Herpes simplex has two genes， Us5 and Us3， which encode pro-teins that also inhibit caspases. In contrast， Epstein-Barr virus， which causes acute infectious mononucleosis ， produces a protein that resembles Bcl-2，\n\n【12】**Fig.A19.3 Bcl-2 inhibits the processes that lead to programmed cell death. In normal cells， cytochrome c is confined to the mitochondria (first panel). However， during apoptosis the mitochondria swell， allowing the cytochrome c to leak out into the cytosol (second panel). There it interacts with the protein Apaf-1， forming a cytochrome c：Apaf-1 complex that can activate caspases. An activated caspase cleaves the I-CAD ， which leads to DNA fragmentation (third panel).

The lethality in mice of knocking out caspase 8 points to the impor-tance of this enzyme in fetal tissue remodeling， but there are known differences between species. Moreover， a point mutation in human caspase 8， at the site where it interacts with the FAS complex， might interfere with its function in FAS-induced apoptosis but not in other， FAS-independent， processes. Thus， a missense mutation in caspase 8 could conceivably cause ALPS.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Hair and scale samples were collected with scraping and examined under a light microscope with 20% KOH solution, detecting spindle-shaped multicellular macroconidia. The source of infection was demonstrated to be a dog kept as a pet by the family for several years. The dog had no evidence of clinical lesions.\n\n【30】Tinea faciei presents a dermatophytic infection of the facial region. The dermatophytes are fungal infections caused by three genera (Tichphyton spp; Microsporum spp. Epidermophyton spp), with the ability to invade and multiply within the keratinized tissue (hair, skin, nails). The typical clinical presentation is erythematous annular plaques with scaling borders, pustules, and crusts may be present too. Lesions may assume other shapes also, such as the oval, circinate, and arcuate. Typically the lesions spread centrifugally with central clearing, and an advancing inflammatory border is seen in most cases. The lesions can be single, presenting as a plaque or patch, or they can be multiple. Tinea corporis might result in a spread from human to human, animal to human, and soil to human. Domestic animals are an important factor in transmitting the infection, especially the zoophilic species. Infections due to zoophilic organisms such as _Microsporum canis_ tend to be associated with severe inflammatory changes. In contrast, anthropophilic organisms such as _Trichophyton tonsurans_ may be associated with minimal inflammation and fine scaling 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】Tinea faciei accounts for about 3–4% of all cases of tinea corporis, frequently reported in tropical countries. It affects all age groups, with two peaks in children between 2 and 14 years and adults between 20 and 40 years of age. Both trichophyton and microsporum species can cause tinea facie 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【32】Dermatophytic infections are common during childhood, but they can be misdiagnosed because of their polymorphic clinical appearance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. A typical clinical presentation, e.g. annular configuration, scales, pustules in the borders, usually does not pose a challenge in being diagnosed by a trained eye. Atypical forms may lead to misdiagnosis and delayed recovery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【33】An Italian study analyzed 154 cases of atypical tinea. The authors concluded that clinical atypia is not a consequence of TCS but present at the onset of the illness due to the variable dermatophyte’s invasive capacity, the site of the invasion, and acquired conditions such as excessive washing or sun exposure . Therefore _Azori et al._ suggest that “tinea atypica” rather than “tinea incognito” includes all forms of dermatophytosis that do not present the classic features for both primary and secondary pathomorphosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【34】The variations in the clinical presentation result from the dermatophyte’s characteristics and a combination of patients’ immunity response . Other factors may also contribute, including excessive washing, sun exposure, and the use of cosmetic products. The eventual prescription of TCS or calcineurin inhibitors further induces pathomorphosis (tinea incognito), leading to longstanding disease.\n\n【35】The factors responsible for the increase in the disease incidence are untreated contacts with superficial dermatophytosis, inappropriate treatment with incorrectly prescribed or over-the-counter steroid-containing triple/quadruple combination creams, and inadequate dosing and duration of antifungal therapy. Clinical presentation with large patches and extensive body surface area involvement is common.\n\n【36】The differential diagnosis of tinea faciei includes lupus vulgaris, granuloma annulare, demodicosis, erythema chronicum migrans, annular psoriasis, subacute lupus cutaneous, perioral dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis.\n\n【37】In tropical countries, where epidemiologically tuberculosis is very common, tinea atypica or tinea incognito can lead to suspect lupus vulgaris. Typically lupus vulgaris presents as a slowly progressive irregular and an infiltrative plaque with central atrophic scarring and advancing borders. However, the early evolving lesions may not show scarring. Granuloma annulare is also characterized by the annular erythematous plaques with an elevated periphery and a depressed center. The lesions are mostly localized in the hands, feet, and wrists, but can also be located anywhere in the body, including the face. Annular psoriasis typically presents as plaques with diffuse thick, white scales, but it can also present as annular lesions with scale only on the borders. Erythema chronicum migrans is the cutaneous hallmark of Lyme disease. One or more large erythematous patches may appear anywhere on the skin. The lesions expand centrifugally, sometimes with central clearing, giving rise to annular patches. The neonatal cutaneous lupus erythematosus may present with polycyclic annular lesions. In the literature, cases of tinea are described as mimicking impetiginized eczema, rosacea-like dermatitis, and seborrhoic dermatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【38】Tinea facei should be suspected not just in children with annular lesions but also papulopustular eruptions, infiltrated plaques, eczema-like, and impetigo-like lesions. The diagnosis of tinea is quickly confirmed using a potassium hydroxide (KOH) microscopic slide preparation or culture, which provides precise identification of the species 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【39】Tinea corporis is generally responsive to topical creams such as terbinafine ; oral antifungal agents may be indicated for extensive disease, failed topical treatment, or for immunocompromised patients. Tinea capitis must be treated with systemic antifungal agents because topical agents do not penetrate the hair shaft. However, concomitant treatment with 1% or 2.5% selenium sulfide shampoo or 2% ketoconazole shampoo should be used for the first 2 weeks because it may reduce transmission. For many years, the first-line treatment for tinea capitis has been griseofulvin because it has a long track record of safety and effectiveness. However, randomized clinical trials have confirmed that newer agents, such as terbinafine and fluconazole, have equal efficacy , safety, and shorter treatment courses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【40】Key Points\n\n【41】*   Tinea is a common disease in the pediatric population, but it is rare in the first year of life.\n\n【42】*   Differential diagnosis may include seborrheic dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, neonatal lupus, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, and syphilis.\n\n【43】*   Parents and close contacts should be carefully examined for superficial fungal infections.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

They have three children, aged \n\n【3】10, 7 and 5, all born by caesarean section. The oldest son has Asperger’s syndrome. Until \n\n【4】now they have been using the contraceptive pill but as she is slightly overweight (body mass \n\n【5】index 29) and has a family history of cardiovascular disease, her GP has advised her to seek \n\n【6】an alternative. She tried the levonorgestrel intrauterine system (IUS) but had it removed after \n\n【7】6 months due to irregular bleeding.\n\n【8】She is aged 38 and is otherwise healthy. She does not smoke and takes no other medication.\n\n【9】Her husband is supportive and initially planned a vasectomy but after initial consultation \n\n【10】decided that he could not go through with it due to his fear of the procedure.\n\n【11】They have read widely on the Internet and decided that laparoscopic sterilization is the most \n\n【12】suitable method for them in view of its reliability and permanence.\n\n【13】Examination\n\n【14】Blood pressure is 150/85. The body mass index is 29. On abdominal inspection the caesarean \n\n【15】section scars are noted as well as an appendectomy scar.\n\n【16】The abdomen is soft and non-tender with no palpable masses. Speculum examination is \n\n【17】unremarkable and on bimanual examination the uterus is normal size, mobile and anteverted.\n\n【18】Questions\n\n【19】• How would you establish whether sterilization really is an appropriate choice for \n\n【20】this couple?\n\n【21】• If you agree with her request for laparoscopic sterilization in principle, how would \n\n【22】you counsel regarding the procedure before agreeing to proceed?\n\n【23】• Are there any other suitable contraceptive options that this woman should consider \n\n【24】apart from laparoscopic sterilization?100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology\n\n【25】60\n\n【26】ANSWER 25\n\n【27】Appropriateness of sterilization\n\n【28】The fact that this couple’s youngest child is 5 years old would suggest that they have had \n\n【29】time to consider having further children and have definitively decided against this. It \n\n【30】may be that the eldest child with Asperger’s means that they are particularly keen to \n\n【31】avoid pregnancy due to their involvement with his care. However in counselling couples \n\n【32】regarding sterilization, it is important to encourage them to consider whether there are \n\n【33】any circumstances under which their decision might change, e.g. the death of an existing \n\n【34】child (or children) or the breakup of their relationship and wanting to have a child with \n\n【35】a new partner.\n\n【36】Assuming that these have been considered and other non-permanent contraceptive options \n\n【37】offered, or as in this case of the levonorgestrel IUS having been tried, then sterilization is a \n\n【38】reasonable and effective choice.\n\n【39】Counselling before laparoscopic sterilization\n\n【40】In addition to an explanation of the laparoscopic sterilization procedure, the following points \n\n【41】should be discussed and documented before consent for sterilization is obtained:\n\n【42】• Sterilization should be considered a permanent procedure. Reversal of tubal steril￾ization has low success rates (maximum 60 per cent).\n\n【43】• Up to 10 per cent of women regret their decision for sterilization.\n\n【44】• The failure rate of laparoscopic sterilization is 2 in 100 women who have been steril￾ized for one year.\n\n【45】• If a pregnancy does occur after sterilization then there is an increased risk of this \n\n【46】being an ectopic pregnancy. Early ultrasound scan is therefore recommended in \n\n【47】such circumstances.\n\n【48】• Laparoscopy carries associated risks of bleeding, infection, injury to bowel or blad￾der or blood vessels (3 in 1000 risk of significant harm), thrombosis and anaesthetic \n\n【49】complications. These risks may be increased in this case due to the woman’s previ￾ous surgery, blood pressure and body mass index.\n\n【50】• There is a small chance that sterilization procedure will be impossible due to techni￾cal difficulty, in which case she should be asked to give consent for open sterilization \n\n【51】though a mini-laparotomy incision.\n\n【52】Alternatives to laparoscopic sterilization\n\n【53】Transcervical hysteroscopically performed sterilization is a relatively new method of ster￾ilization. It involves the insertion of small flexible inserts into the fallopian tubes via a hys￾teroscope. These inserts cause a fibrotic reaction within the tubes so that within 3 months \n\n【54】the tubes are occluded. The occlusion needs to be confirmed with hysterosalpingography \n\n【55】however before alternative contraception can be stopped.\n\n【56】In this woman’s case this should be considered particularly as she is overweight, mildly \n\n【57】hypertensive and has had four previous abdominal operations, such that her risks of surgery \n\n【58】are significant.Case 26: Labile mood and abdominal pain\n\n【59】61", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

At this point, the therapist personified OCD and suggested to Natalie that the objective was to “mess” with OCD: OCD was demanding a ritual to be performed “just so” and Natalie’s goal was to do it the “wrong” way (e.g. leaving some asymmetry, postponing the ritual, making it difficult to complete the ritual, restricting the time devoted to the ritual, etc.), if she could not resist not doing it at all. The personification of OCD was extremely helpful to Natalie insofar as it gave her something concrete to imagine fighting against, and so she and her therapist used this type of phrasing for the remainder of the treatment course.\n\n【5】For Natalie’s first exposure, her therapist suggested starting with an exercise that would provoke low-to-moderate levels of anxiety, as measured by subjective units of distress (SUDs) on a 0 (no distress) to 10 (extreme distress) scale. A situation linked with a SUD level of 4 was selected as something that would reliably provoke distress, but would not be so overwhelming that Natalie could not resist the urge to ritualize. Natalie and her therapist agreed on the following exposure: Have Natalie go to a nearby convenience store and buy several items (e.g. gum, ice tea, lip balm) based on the lowest price, regardless of into which category the item fit. Importantly, Natalie agreed that she would not go back to the store to balance out the boy/girl ratio after the session was over. Despite Natalie’s initial expectations, her distress habituated, and she did not experience this exposure as “torture.” At the conclusion of the session, Natalie’s therapist asked her to narrow down the experience into one take home “nugget,” or lesson learned. Natalie stated that she was amazed to realize that her anxiety did indeed subside as promised, and that she also was able to tolerate the anxiety without engaging in rituals. For her initial homework, Natalie was instructed to practice ERP each day.\n\n【6】Subsequent exposures were structured in a similar manner. Natalie and her therapist would jointly choose the exposure, always using in-session practice to move up slightly on her fear hierarchy , followed by daily practice for homework. At the conclusion of each exposure exercise, Natalie was always asked to formulate a succinct, key lesson learned. Exposures were initially selected in such a way that the outcome could either be symmetrical or asymmetrical, the important aspect being that Natalie did not have control over the situation. In all of these cases, Natalie was asked to make a decision about something using a rule other than the boy/girl classification system. For example, rather than Natalie choosing the color of her nail polish, she would ask the nail technician to choose a color randomly. After Natalie was able to tolerate the distress associated with these types of exposures, her therapist suggested exposures in which Natalie purposely made things asymmetrical. For example, she would purposely choose the same “gender” nail polish to wear for several weeks, or would purposely order “asymmetrical” food at restaurants.\n\n【7】Exposures towards the end of therapy were exclusively focused around the upper quadrant of Natalie’s fear hierarchy, which was expanded as treatment progressed. One example exposure was having Natalie purposefully organize her living space in an asymmetrical manner. The patient was very interested in art, and she would hang pictures in a particular manner to achieve a boy/girl balance. Together with her therapist, Natalie proceeded to print out copies of the various pictures she owned and then proceeded to hang them in an asymmetrical manner in the therapy room. She was then asked to complete the same procedure with her pictures at home. Another exposure involved having Natalie curate her art by selecting her favorite posters and then discarding or donating the others, regardless of the resulting imbalance between boy/girl art. A final set of exposures were designed to address Natalie’s fear regarding asymmetry and her worry that she would always experience her obsessions. Specifically, Natalie’s therapist guided her in an imaginal exposure on what it would be like to live in an asymmetrical world forever.\n\n【8】Complicating Factor\n\n【9】A main complicating factor in Natalie’s treatment was that after initial treatment gains, she experienced fluctuating levels of motivation with regard to her willingness to do exposures and to continue with therapy. As often occurs with patients with OCD, as one’s symptoms wax and wane—both naturally and throughout the course of treatment—the individual’s ambivalence regarding change may also fluctuate, which can contribute to the treatment refusal and drop out (Maltby and Tolin 2003 ). The nature of exposure exercises is intrinsically frightening and demanding; as progress is achieved on lower steps of the fear hierarchy, patients may be resistant to tackling more challenging exposures as entailed in the full treatment plan. In Natalie’s case, her motivation faltered because she experienced less impairment after she responded to the first phase of ERP. As described in the overview section, she did not find her concerns with asymmetry inherently ego-dystonic, so once she was able to participate more fully in day-to-day activities without interference from her symptoms, she experienced less impetus to continue with treatment.\n\n【10】Natalie’s therapist became aware of the fact that Natalie was not completing her weekly homework and had become less focused on therapy (e.g. tardy to sessions, less enthusiastic, refusing to comply with planned in-session exposures). The therapist responded by directly discussing these observations with Natalie, along with the potential reasons for her nonadherence. Several possibilities for why Natalie may have had difficulty completing the homework exposures were explored, including level of exposure difficulty (i.e. Were the exposures too difficult to complete alone?) and logistical reasons (i.e. Was she running out of time during the week? Was there some external reason that was preventing her from completing the homework?). Natalie stated that none of these issues were causing interference, and that she simply was no longer bothered as much by her symptoms as when she first entered therapy.\n\n【11】At this point, Natalie’s therapist shifted into several sessions of modified motivational enhancement training (MET; Miller et al. 1994 ). MET is a motivational interviewing (MI; Miller and Rollnick 2002 ) technique that can be applied in conjunction with ERP to increase and maintain motivation for change throughout ERP. The integration of MI with CBT has been found to be successful for those individuals with anxiety disorders (Westra 2004 ) and has also been shown to be effective in increasing adherence to exposure therapy in particular (Slagle and Gray 2007 ). Originally developed to target alcohol addiction, MI includes a range of strategies to help explore and resolve ambivalence about change, such as demonstrating empathy and fostering discrepancy regarding beliefs, while avoiding a confrontational stance (Westra 2004 ). It can first be applied at the start of the treatment to help change maladaptive beliefs, minimize reluctance to attempt exposures, and instill self-confidence in treatment goals (Riccardi et al. 2010 ). Furthermore, therapists can continue to employ MI techniques at points throughout ERP where hesitance about further exposures becomes evident. While allowing the patient to explore his or her own positive and negative feelings about personal symptoms and the direction of treatment, therapists can guide him/her to bolster his/her own motivation by raising questions about discrepancies between the pros and cons of treatment adherence (i.e. a mismatch between remaining OCD-related impairment vs. personal priorities and goals). As such, MI can help maintain momentum and help increase treatment adherence and retention (Riccardi et al. 2010 ). In the case of Natalie, MET was highly effective in helping her refocus her treatment efforts. It was also instrumental in helping Natalie’s therapist recognize that a greater focus on cognitive work would be helpful in addressing some of Natalie’s attributions and beliefs about her symptoms.\n\n【12】Cognitive Restructuring\n\n【13】At the start of therapy, Natalie and her therapist identified four primary cognitions that were integral to maintaining her symptoms. The first was that anxiety was dangerous, intolerable, and that it would not dissipate unless she made things symmetrical. She also believed that living an asymmetrical life was dangerous because it evoked anxiety and distress, and that she would therefore be unable to cope with a lack of symmetry. Both of these beliefs were addressed non-directly through Natalie’s experiences with ERP. Over time and repeated exposures, Natalie learned that she could in fact tolerate the anxiety related to experiencing NJREs, and that her distress faded with time.\n\n【14】The other two cognitions that were central to Natalie’s OCD included the belief that she needed to control her thoughts, and the fact that she placed a marked value on symmetry and perfection. These beliefs did not change in response to ERP and shifted into greater focus as a result of the MET/MI-focused sessions. To target these beliefs, Natalie’s therapist used a range of different cognitive strategies flexibly and on an as-needed basis to try and encourage Natalie to achieve a more helpful or rationale response (Wilhelm and Steketee 2006 ). Example techniques included Socratic dialogue to highlight logical inconsistencies in Natalie’s thinking patterns, discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of her beliefs, the continuum technique to highlight the implications of only focusing on extremes, and behavioral experiments to test Natalie’s assumptions. Two behavioral experiments that were particularly helpful were testing the consequences of asymmetry and the classic “white bear” thought suppression exercise. These experiences allowed Natalie to test the validity of her assumptions, by contrasting her feared outcome to actual consequences. Another helpful cognitive technique was the use of metaphors, stories, and analogies, which were designed to promote acceptance of her intrusive boy/girl classification thoughts and her need for symmetry. This latter technique was particularly helpful in addressing the shame and sadness Natalie felt in response to having OCD.\n\n【15】Therapy Conclusion and Relapse Prevention\n\n【16】After 19 sessions, Natalie and her therapist agreed that she had made sufficient progress to no longer need weekly sessions and that therapy could possibly be terminated soon. The next two sessions focused on relapse prevention. First, Natalie and her therapist created a handout that incorporated and summarized all of the behavioral and cognitive tools that Natalie had learned. The therapist also spent time evaluating Natalie’s thoughts about treatment termination. Together, they discussed potential difficulties that may arise, along with possible solutions. After a 1-month hiatus, Natalie returned to therapy and provided an update on her symptoms and her use of CBT. The patient was pleased to report that she had felt confident addressing any symptoms that emerged and had successfully navigated two minor setbacks. The therapist used the latter situations to help Natalie differentiate between lapses and relapses and underscored the importance of engaging in helpful thinking about how best to react towards symptom flare-ups. At this point, Natalie and her therapist agreed that it was an appropriate time to terminate treatment, though the possibility of booster sessions was discussed.\n\n【17】Conclusions and Key Practice Points\n-----------------------------------\n\n【18】On the whole, the cognitive behavioral approach to treating Natalie’s symmetry symptoms was very effective. During the first phase of treatment, which was more strongly rooted within a behavioral framework, Natalie was able to substantially reduce her compulsions and was also able to tackle the vast majority of the original fear hierarchy she and her therapist had outlined. Following the MI-focused sessions that were used after the first wave of ERP, more and more cognitive techniques were woven into the treatment plan. This shift in treatment approach was important for Natalie, as it allowed her to evaluate a number of her thinking patterns relevant to both OCD and her symptoms of depression. The final phase of treatment included a combination of cognitive and ERP techniques to tackle the upper limits of her fear hierarchy. Throughout the course of treatment, Natalie’s therapist continually monitored the patient’s symptoms and any treatment interfering behaviors. This allowed for a flexible use of cognitive and behavioral techniques that best fit Natalie’s needs at any given point in time. Another key element of the treatment approach was that Natalie and her therapist worked very collaboratively in selecting exposures, designing homework, and identifying next treatment targets. Over time, this approach allowed Natalie to become her own therapist, an important element in helping to prepare her for the time following the termination of therapy .\n\n【19】Table 6.3\n\n【20】Key practice points for treating the primary problem\n\n| Key practice points |\n| --- |\n| Careful assessment at intake and continued monitoring of symptoms |\n| Response prevention combined with exposures using a carefully captured fear hierarchy |\n| Cognitive techniques to target dysfunctional automatic thoughts and core beliefs |\n| Managing obstacles, including difficulties with habituation during exposures, waxing and waning motivation |\n\n【22】At the end of the treatment, Natalie’s therapist once again had her complete the battery of questionnaires and interviews listed in Table 6.1 . Across the board, the assessment indicated that she no longer became anxious when things were uneven or asymmetrical. Natalie also reported not engaging in avoidance of situations that previously had provoked anxiety and had almost completely eliminated her mental compulsions and physical rituals. Most importantly, Natalie expressed satisfaction and happiness that she could finally make decisions in her life based on her personal preferences, rather than basing decisions on her OCD. Her YBOCS score decreased throughout the treatment and was determined to meet criteria for symptom remission, as evidenced by a reduction of over 45–50 % (Storch et al. 2010 ). Additionally, Natalie no longer met criteria for OCD and endorsed only mild depressive symptoms. Natalie reported that although she still struggled from time to time with feeling discouraged when she experienced an obsession, overall she felt proud of the work she had done and the fact that she had learned to live in “an asymmetrical world.”", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

A blood sample was collected from the medial metatarsal vein for a blood profile .﻿\n\n【10】Interpretive Discussion\n\n【11】The hemogram appears to be within normal limits based on references for other species of Anseriformes. Figure 64.2a shows a heterophil (granulocyte on top of the image) and an eosinophil (granulocyte on bottom of the image). Figure 64.2b shows a lymphocyte, a throm-bocyte (cell in the center of the image), and a mono-cyte. Figure 64.2c shows a heterophil and a lymphocyte. The images show a normal degree of polychromasia for a nonanemic bird, and the heterophil morphology is normal.\n\n【12】The plasma biochemistry profile appears to be within normal limits for Anseriformes, according to the limited references.\n\n【13】Figures 64.3a and 64.3b show few to moderate numbers of erythrocytes and a population of large pleomor-phic nucleated cells that appear to be related (having a common source). These cells are round to spindle-shaped and exhibit anisocytosis and anisokaryosis. Many of the cells have one or more nuclei. The nuclear chromatin is coarsely clumped at times, and the cells often reveal prominent large nucleoli. The cytoplasm is often abundant, gray, and contains vacuoles. One small cell in Fig. 64.3b . contains numerous golden brown cytoplasmic granules. Figure 64.3c shows two of these cells containing numerous golden brown cytoplasmic granules, indicative of melanin pigment. The cytology indicates a poorly differentiated melanoma.\n\n【14】Table 64.1 .

The duck died 1 month later. The necropsy and histopatho-logic examination confirmed the diagnosis of a malignant melanoma. The melanoma had metastasized to the base of the heart, incorporating the great blood vessels in that area, which likely contributed to the duck's death .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

She reports generalized weakness and occasional bouts of nausea and vomiting. Her blood pressure is 160/99 mm Hg. Laboratory studies show a serum potassium level of 2.2 mEq/L. She is diagnosed with a condition that affects the production of two of the three major adrenal hormones, leaving only one functioning hormone. In which area of the adrenal gland is this one functioning hormone produced?\n\n【1】> (A) Capsule\n\n【2】> (B) Medulla\n\n【3】> (C) Zona fasciculata\n\n【4】> (D) Zona glomerulosa\n\n【5】> (E) Zona reticularis\n\n【6】 **Answer**: The correct answer is D . 17α-Hydroxylase deficiency, a form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, is characterized by deficits in glucocorticoid and sex steroid synthesis. This is coupled with increased mineralocorticoid (aldosterone) production due to the shunting of precursors, such as pregnenolone and progesterone, through mineralocorticoid pathways. The increased levels of aldosterone lead to increased sodium retention and potassium excretion (hence, the patient’s hypertension and hypokalemia). The low sex steroid levels manifest clinically as a female phenotype with no sexual maturation. Aldosterone is produced in the zona glomerulosa. Aldosterone synthesis requires 21β-hydroxylase but not 17α-hydroxylase. Remember the mnemonic “ S alt, S ugar, and S ex” for the layers of the adrenal cortex and their respective products, with “salt” corresponding to the outer zona glomerulosa, “sugar” corresponding to the middle zona fasciculata, and “sex” corresponding to the inner zona reticularis. 11β-Hydroxylase deficiency is another form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia and causes decreased cortisol, aldosterone, and corticosterone production and excess production of sex hormones and 11-deoxycorticosterone. The symptoms are similar to those of 17α-hydroxylase deficiency, manifesting as hypertension and hypokalemia; however, virilization would also be present.  \n\n【7】Answer A is incorrect . The capsule does not produce any hormones.  \n\n【8】Answer B is incorrect . The medulla produces catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine); neither 17α-hydroxylase nor 21β-hydroxylase is required for the synthesis of catecholamines.  \n\n【9】Answer C is incorrect . Cortisol is produced in the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex. Cortisol synthesis requires 21β-hydroxylase and 17α-hydroxylase and is therefore deficient in this patient.  \n\n【10】Answer E is incorrect . Sex hormones are produced in the zona reticularis. Synthesis of the sex hormones requires 17α-hydroxylase, but not 21β-hydroxylase, and is therefore deficient in this patient, leading to her primary amenorrhea. 11β-Hydroxylase deficiency is another form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and causes decreased cortisol, aldosterone, and corticosterone production and excess production of sex hormones and 11-deoxycorticosterone. The symptoms are similar to those of 17α-hydroxylase deficiency, manifesting as hypertension and hypokalemia; however, virilization would also be present.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The client had scheduled an appointment to have the snake examined 1 month prior to presentation; however, that appointment was cancelled. The client acquired the snake as an adult and owned the snake for 4 years. She did not know its exact age or its gender. The snake routinely ate an adult mouse once a week. The snake began exhibiting noisy breathing approximately 6 months earlier, but its respiratory effort became more noticeable during the past 3 months.\n\n【7】Fig. 76.1 . An image of the Ball python with severe dyspnea.﻿\n\n【8】Physical Examination\n\n【9】The snake was presented in a state of severe respiratory distress. It positioned itself with the head and neck held in a vertical position as it breathed through an opened mouth. An obvious respiratory noise was made with each rapid breath as if made through a constricted airway. The ventral scutes were creased along the midline in the area of the lungs, indicating chronic labored breathing. The snake's overall body condition appeared normal.\n\n【10】A 2.0 mm endotracheal tube was inserted through the body wall and placed into the air sac (saccular lung) to provide immediate respiratory relief. A 3.0 mm rigid laparoscope was inserted through the glottis and into the trachea. A white glistening tracheal mass occluding nearly 95% of the tracheal lumen was found approximately 2.5 cm distal to the rima glottis. A flexible biopsy instrument was inserted into the trachea in an attempt to remove the mass; however, only a small portion of the mass was sampled. A small blood sample was obtained via caudal venipuncture and submitted for hematologic examination .﻿\n\n【11】Interpretive Discussion\n\n【12】The hemogram reveals a monocytosis and an elevated plasma protein (normal plasma protein values using the biuret method for most snakes is less than 8 g/dL). This suggests an inflammatory response; however, a monocytosis without a coexisting leukocytosis and heterophilia is unusual. The monocytosis is likely associated with mobilization of monocytes because of peripheral demand for macrophages. Perhaps other cells were misidentified as monocytes because of their unusual morphology, such as toxic heterophils, if present. A blood film in this case, however, was not available for review.\n\n【13】Table 76.1 .

These cells are embedded in an eosinophilic background material. The nuclei are frequently positioned at one edge of the cell and have coarsely granular chromatin with occasional prominent nucleoli. The cells exhibit moderate anisocytosis and variable nucleus–cytoplasm ratios. The cytologic examination indicates a mesenchymal cell neoplasm that is producing either chondroid or osteoid, therefore, likely has its origins in cartilage or bone. A chondroma or chondrosarcoma is more likely than an osteogenic sarcoma, owing to the lack of cells having the typical appearance of osteoblasts.\n\n【17】Fig. 76.2 .

The plan was to remove the mass by transection of the involved section of the trachea followed by anastomosis of the healthy tracheal ends.\n\n【20】The gross necropsy revealed a 1 cm white glistening intratracheal mass occluding the lumen. Histopathologic findings revealed an increased number of normal-appearing chondrocytes within lacunae in a disorganized chondroid matrix. Mitotic figures were rare.

Isoflurane via mask was used to induce anesthesia as well as to maintain anesthesia once the ferret was intubated. The ferret was placed in ventral recumbency, and the dorsal skin on the head was prepared for surgical exploration of the mass. A 3-cm linear skin incision was made over the mass. Dissection of the fluid-filled mass revealed a well-encapsulated cyst-like structure that extended ven-tromedially to the right globe and had a visible connection to the right zygomatic salivary gland. Multiple cystlike structures were noted in the gland. The gland along with the associated sac was removed in its entirety while leaving the zygomatic arch intact. The subcutaneous tissue was closed using 4–0 glycopolymer monofilament synthetic absorbable suture. This was followed by skin closure using 4-0 monofilament nylon suture. A 2 mg bupivacaine line block was peri-incisionally given as a local anesthetic prior to recovery from the inhalant anesthetic.

Patients with thymoma， equal sex incidence， peak age of onset 30-50years， no HLA association and poor response to thymectomy.\n\n【61】2\\. Young onset (<40 years)， typically female， thymic medullary germinal centres present， strong association with HLA-B8 and HLA-DR3 and usually a good response to thymectomy.\n\n【62】3\\. Older onset (>40 years)， more common in males， thymic involution， an association with HLA-B7 and HLA-DR9 and doubtful response to thymectomy.\n\n【63】**What do you know about Eaton-Lambert syndrome?**\n\n【64】Eaton-Lambert syndrome (JAMA 1957；163：1117) is a myasthenic disorder associated with malignancy (Brain 1988；111：577； a review of 50 cases). It is associated with small cell carcinoma of the bronchus. Weakness of the truncal and proximal limb muscles is common. The pelvic girdle and thighs are almost invariably involved. Deep tendon reflexes are absent. Transient improvement in muscle strength and deep-tendon reflexes may follow brief exercise. Unlike myasthenia， bulbar symptoms are rare. Antibodies to calcium channels may be detected. Electro-myography is diagnostic. In rested muscle， there is marked depression of neuromuscular transmission after a single submaximal stimulus and marked facilitation of response during repetitive stimulation at rates greater than 10 per second. Assays for P/Q-type calcium channel anti-bodies are positive.\n\n【65】**What is myasthenic crisis?**\n\n【66】Exacerbation of myasthenia. The need for artificial ventilation occurs in about 10% of patients with myasthenia. Those with bulbar and respiratory involvement are prone to respiratory infection. The crisis can be precipi-tated by respiratory infection and surgery. Such patients should be closely monitored for pulmonary function. Those with artificial ventilation are not given cholinergics as this avoids stimulation of pulmonary secretions and uncertainties about overdosage.\n\n【67】**How does a cholinergic crisis manifest?**\n\n【68】Excessive salivation， confusion， lacrimation， miosis， pallor and collapse. It is important to avoid edrophonium in such patients.\n\n【69】**Mention a few associated disorders**\n\n【70】Thyroid disorders (thyrotoxicosis， hypothyroidism)， rheumatoid arthritis， diabetes mellitus， dermatomyositis， pernicious anaemia， SLE， Sjogren’s disease， sarcoidosis， pemphigus.\n\n【71】What is the role of thymectomy in such patients? In the case of thymoma， thymectomy is necessary to prevent tumour spread， although most thymomas are benign. In the absence of a tumour， thymectomy has been found to be beneficial in 85% of patients and 35%go into drug-free remission. The improvement is noticed for 1 to 10 years after surgery (Neurology 1990；40：1828-9). The role of thymectomy in ocular myasthenia， in adults over 55 years of age (Acta Neurol Scand1994；12：343-68) and in children， is still under debate. What is the role of immunomodulation in myasthenia gravis?\n\n【72】Intravenous immunoglobulin seems as efficacious as plasma exchange.\n\n【73】Myasthenia gravis was first described by Oxford physiologist Thomas Willis in1672 and by Erb in 1878.

The nature of healthcare means that most clinicians are \n\n【20】naturally empathetic and compassionate people who thrive themselves by being able to help \n\n【21】others. But in modern-day medicine could compassion be considered more of a hindrance to \n\n【22】clinical care than an essential attribute? Is demonstrating compassion something that can be \n\n【23】taught whilst simultaneously ensuring that clinicians learn to keep themselves emotionally \n\n【24】detached from their patients? Analogies have been made between frontline medicine – general \n\n【25】practice and A&E departments – and battlefields. Constant exposure to sustained levels of \n\n【26】human suffering, complex conditions and a loss of autonomy over working conditions is lead￾ing to higher rates of clinician burnout. One critical symptom of burnout is a loss of emotional \n\n【27】integrity and compassion. The clinician becomes so overwhelmed by absorbing the emotions \n\n【28】of others that subconscious barriers go up as a self-protective mechanism. This in turn can be \n\n【29】significantly detrimental to the patient, who will not feel listened to or cared about.\n\n【30】Ironically, it is often the most compassionate clinicians who burn out quickest, and in the cur￾rent work environment there is increasing emphasis on how to become more resilient to both \n\n【31】the emotional intensity of the job and the increasing demands from patients. In this context \n\n【32】resilience has been defined as ‘the ability to maintain professional and personal well-being \n\n【33】in the face of ongoing work stress and adversity’ (McCann et al. 2013). Several studies have \n\n【34】explored ways of increasing resilience, and all of these suggest that factors such as a supportive \n\n【35】work environment, socialising, humour and high levels of job satisfaction are all protective \n\n【36】factors against burnout. One particular study suggested that resilience can actually be taught \n\n【37】and that the concept of resilience should be ‘introduced in all training programmes (including \n\n【38】education on ways to strengthen one’s own resilience, such as building a positive identity and \n\n【39】increasing social support, coping skills and spiritual connection)’ (McAllister and McKinnon \n\n【40】2009). Following the Francis Report in 2013, which demonstrated systemic failings in care at \n\n【41】Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust, it appeared that this could all be blamed on a lack of compas￾sion from staff at all levels. This prompted public debate about how to increase compassion \n\n【42】in the healthcare setting. Should it be tested for when interviewing job applicants? Should \n\n【43】compassion be incentivised, with nurses who demonstrate higher levels of compassion being \n\n【44】paid more? Conversely, one could argue that a surgeon does not need to care about the patient \n\n【45】in order to do their job well and the Health Care Assistant does not need to care about their \n\n【46】patient in order to empty a bed pan or provide food to a patient. Incentivising compassion in \n\n【47】the current climate would be disastrous – persistent understaffing and lack of resources have \n\n【48】put many healthcare workers at breaking point, and being made to ‘act out’ compassion would \n\n【49】be more stressful and likely to result in more work-related stress than trying to rectify the \n\n【50】underlying problems. Yet compassion does improve patient experience of healthcare and has \n\n【51】been shown to help improve recovery. Finding ways to support healthcare workers remaining \n\n【52】compassionate is the key to preventing another crisis like the one in Mid-Staffs. Better staffing, \n\n【53】more job autonomy and the feeling that someone will listen if things are going wrong will all \n\n【54】support a better work environment and will help promote natural compassion.\n\n【55】Key Points\n\n【56】• Compassion is undoubtedly beneficial for a positive experience of patient care \n\n【57】but does not necessarily equate to being able to provide good-quality and safe \n\n【58】clinical care.\n\n【59】• Compassion without resilience can cause clinician burnout.223\n\n【60】Duties of a Doctor", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

He has never had an episode like this before. He does recall having a cold approximately three weeks earlier and has been experiencing increased fatigue and breathlessness since then, but he denies any current symptoms of rhinorrhea, sore throat, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. X-ray of the chest shows diffuse opacities in both lower lung fields, and urinalysis reveals RBCs in the urine. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【1】> (A) Acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis\n\n【2】> (B) Alport syndrome\n\n【3】> (C) Berger disease\n\n【4】> (D) Goodpasture syndrome\n\n【5】> (E) Minimal change disease\n\n【6】 **Answer**: The correct answer is D . Goodpasture syndrome is a rare autoimmune disorder in which antibodies directed against glomerular basement membrane (GBM) antigen cause a rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. The antibodies can also deposit in the alveolar basement membranes, resulting in hemoptysis. It is most often seen in young men. This condition can be diagnosed by the detection of the anti-GBM antibodies in the blood, in combination with a kidney biopsy that demonstrates a linear staining pattern on immunofluorescence. Because this condition may rapidly lead to a compromised airway or declining kidney function, immediate airway protection, plasmapheresis (to remove the autoantibodies from circulation), and treatment with corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide is indicated.  \n\n【7】Answer A is incorrect . Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis typically affects 2-14 year olds who have recently suffered from either impetigo or pharyngitis caused by particular M types of streptococci (nephritogenic strains). Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is an immune-mediated disease that develops twosix weeks after skin infection and one-three weeks after streptococcal pharyngitis. The classic presentation is an acute nephritic picture with hematuria, pyuria, RBC casts, edema, hypertension, and oliguric renal failure. This patient’s age and gender in combination with his symptoms of lung hemorrhage and hematuria make Goodpasture syndrome the most likely diagnosis.  \n\n【8】Answer B is incorrect . Alport disease is an inherited disorder caused by a mutation in collagen type IV, which is an important structural component in the basement membranes of the eyes, ears, and kidneys. Patients with this syndrome usually present in childhood with a combination of ocular defects, deafness, and hematuria. Given this patient’s age and clinical presentation, Goodpasture syndrome is a more likely diagnosis than Alport syndrome.  \n\n【9】Answer C is incorrect . Berger disease, otherwise known as IgA nephropathy, is the most common cause of glomerulonephritis worldwide. It is caused by the deposition of IgA antibodies in the mesangium of the kidney and is often triggered by a recent upper respiratory infection. Classically patients with Berger disease present with new onset frank hematuria, usually within days of an upper respiratory tract infection. Although the hematuria may persist for several days, renal function usually remains normal, and the long-term prognosis is relatively favorable. Given the patient’s lung involvement, Goodpasture syndrome is a more likely diagnosis than Berger disease.  \n\n【10】Answer E is incorrect . In the pediatric population, nephrotic syndrome (characterized by proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia, and edema) is most commonly caused by minimal change disease (MCD). MCD is definitively diagnosed on renal biopsy, which reveals effacement of the foot process supporting the epithelial podocytes with weakening of slit-pore membranes on electron microscopy, but normal findings on light and immunofluorescent microscopy. The pathophysiology of this lesion is uncertain, although most agree there is a circulating cytokine that alters capillary charge and podocyte integrity. Treatment with steroids is indicated based on clinical suspicion of MCD; renal biopsy is not necessary before treatment is initiated. Given this patient’s age and clinical presentation, Goodpasture syndrome is a more likely diagnosis than MCD.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Which of the following is the most likely pleural fluid characteristic if thoracentesis is performed?\n\n【1】A. Pleural fluid LDH 39, LDH ratio 0.2, protein ratio 0.7\n\n【2】B. Pleural fluid LDH 39, LDH ratio 0.2, protein ratio 0.1\n\n【3】C. Pleural fluid LDH 599, LDH ratio 0.9, protein ratio 0.1\n\n【4】D. Pleural fluid LDH 599, LDH ratio 0.9, protein ratio 0.7\n\n【5】**Answer**: 45.1 B. Congestive heart failure is commonly associated with bilateral pleural effusions, which are transudative, as a consequence of alteration of Starling forces. The effusions of heart failure are best managed by treating the heart failure, for example, with diuretics, and typically do not require thoracentesis.\n\n【6】**Question**: 45.2 A 39-year-old man develops a moderate free-flowing pleural effusion following a left lower lobe pneumonia. Thoracentesis reveals straw-colored fluid with gram-positive diplococci on Gram stain, pH 6.9, glucose 32 mg/dL, and LDH 1890. Which of the following is the best next step?\n\n【7】A. Send the fluid for culture.\n\n【8】B. Continue treatment with antibiotics for pneumococcal infection.\n\n【9】C. Tube thoracostomy to drain the effusion.\n\n【10】D. Schedule a follow-up chest x-ray in 2 weeks to document resolution of the effusion.\n\n【11】**Answer**: 45.2 C. The positive Gram stain, low pH, low glucose, and markedly elevated LDH all suggest that this parapneumonic effusion is “complicated,” that is, it is unlikely to resolve with antibiotic therapy and is likely to produce loculated pockets of pus, which will require surgical intervention. Drainage by serial thoracentesis or tube thoracostomy is essential.\n\n【12】**Question**: 45.3 A 69-year-old man complains of gradually worsening dyspnea and a nagging cough over the past 3 months but no fevers. He is found to have a right-sided pleural effusion, which is tapped and is grossly bloody. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【13】A. Parapneumonic effusion\n\n【14】B. Malignancy in the pleural space\n\n【15】C. Rupture of aortic dissection into the pleural space\n\n【16】D. Pulmonary embolism with pulmonary infarction\n**Answer**: 45.3 B. The most common causes of hemorrhagic pleural effusion are malignancy, pulmonary embolism, and tuberculosis. Pulmonary embolism would be suggested by acute onset of dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain rather than this subacute presentation. Similarly, aortic rupture can produce a hemothorax but would have an acute presentation with pain and hemodynamic compromise.\n\n【17】CLINICAL PEARLS\n\n【18】 Transudative effusions meet none of the following criteria (exudative effusions meet at least one): (a) Pleural fluid protein/serum protein ratio more than 0.5. (b) Pleural fluid LDH/serum LDH ratio more than 0.6. (c) Pleural fluid LDH greater than two-thirds normal serum LDH.\n\n【19】 Tube thoracostomy or more aggressive drainage of parapneumonic effusion usually is required with gross pus (empyema), positive Gram stain or culture, glucose less than 60 mg/dL, pH less than 7.10, and loculations.\n\n【20】 The most common cause of pleural effusion is congestive heart failure, which typically gives bilateral symmetric transudative effusions and is best treated with diuresis.\n\n【21】 The most common causes of bloody pleural effusion (in the absence of trauma) are malignancy, pulmonary embolism with infarction, and tuberculosis.\n\n【22】#", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Pinpoint pupils may be observed in pontine lesions or \n\n【38】after local cholinergic drops, but history and examination suggest opioid overdose. Naloxone \n\n【39】is a specific opiate antagonist with no agonist or euphoriant properties. On intravenous or \n\n【40】subcutaneous administration it rapidly reverses the respiratory depression and sedation \n\n【41】caused by heroin intoxication, confirming the diagnosis, as in this case. Immediate manage￾ment involves securing the airway, stabilizing breathing and circulation (ABC) and provid￾ing supported ventilation and intravenous fluids. Naloxone is administered at a continuous \n\n【42】0.3 mg/h infusion aimed at keeping the GCS at 15 and a respiratory rate over 12 breaths per \n\n【43】minute. He will need to be observed in an intensive care unit (ICU) with naloxone infusion \n\n【44】until all opioids are cleared from the system. Investigations include blood and urine toxicol￾ogy, full blood count for infections and arterial blood gases to monitor oxygenation. Further \n\n【45】investigations include liver function tests, rapid plasma reagent (RPR), hepatitis viral testing, \n\n【46】HIV testing in view of IV drug use and chest X-ray to rule out pulmonary fibrosis.\n\n【47】Detailed history and mental state examination are needed to assess whether the overdose was \n\n【48】accidental or deliberate and to rule out psychiatric disorders such as depression. A sermon \n\n【49】listing the ill-effects of substance misuse is likely to be ineffective and, in an acute setting, \n\n【50】inappropriate. Motivational interviewing (MI) techniques have been shown to be more effec￾tive. This is where the patient, rather than the doctor, lists the costs and benefits of continued \n\n【51】substance misuse. Key components of MI are as follows:\n\n【52】1. Using empathy to understand the patient’s point of view and reasons for using opioids.\n\n【53】2.

An ongoing psychosocial care package with cogni￾tive or group therapy aimed at relapse prevention is vital. MT reduces illicit drug use, crimi￾nal activity, risk of seroconversion for HIV, hepatitis B and C and improves socialization. \n\n【72】Methadone can be fatal in overdose and also has street value so medication is dispensed in \n\n【73】liquid form (rather than tablets that can be reconstituted for injection).\n\n【74】Stages of change\n\n【75】Precontemplation: The patient does not acknowledge the problem and is often defensive about \n\n【76】his or her substance misuse.\n\n【77】Contemplation: There is awareness of the consequences of substance misuse while weighing \n\n【78】up of the pros and cons of quitting. There is no decision made to change.\n\n【79】Preparation/determination: A commitment is made to change, involving research and prepa￾ration for the consequences.

The expansive-ness of the diagnostic evaluation of a woman with androgen excess is dependent on the clinical situ-ation and the degree of androgen hypersecretion. For example， adrenal gland imaging is not needed when the signs and symptoms related to androgen excess are chronic and mild and serum testosterone concentration is mildly increased in a woman with a typical history of polycystic ovarian syndrome. However， with more abrupt onset of marked signs and symptoms and more marked increases in serum testosterone concentrations， it is important to assess the patient with a full androgen profile and imaging studies of the ovaries and adrenal glands. When an adrenal tumor with a suspicious imaging phenotype is identified in a woman with androgen excess， it should be determined if other adreno-cortical hormones are also being autonomously secreted. Herein we present a case of a patient with a nearly pure testosterone-secreting adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC).\n\n【3】The patient was a 44-year-old woman seen for pro-gressive hirsutism over the prior 2 years. Her self-graded Ferriman-Gallwey score was 25 (normal，<8； maximum= 36). She also had marked androgenic scalp hair loss.

An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan， obtained as part of her secondary hypertension evaluation， detected a2.6×2.9×2.7-cm left adrenal mass with suspicious imaging characteristics . Although she was overweight， her body weight had been stable. She had no signs or symptoms of Cushing syndrome. There was no history of hypokalemia. Her medications included amlodipine， 5 mg daily； hydrochlorothiazide， 25 mg daily； and spironolactone， 100 mg daily. On physi-cal examination， her body mass index was 36 kg/m2， bloodpressure 176/104 mmHg， and heart rate 89beats per minute. She had marked hirsutism and male pattern balding， but she was not virilized.\n\n【5】**INVESTIGATIONS**\n\n【6】Laboratory test results are shown inTable 90.1Marked testosterone hypersecretion was documented. Although the midnight salivary cortisol concentra-tion and the 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion were normal， the serum corticotropin concentration was low-normal and a 2-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test documented glucocorticoid secretory autonomy. These data were consistent with dominant testosterone hypersecretion and mild autonomous cortisol cosecretion. Although the adrenal mass was relatively small， the imaging phenotype on CT scan and the plurihormonal pattern on laboratory testing favored an ACC.\n\n【7】**TREATMENT**\n\n【8】The patient was treated with perioperative gluco-corticoid coverage and underwent laparoscopic left adrenalectomy.Thetumor上proved tobe\n\n【9】_A_ B\n\n【10】**Fig. 90.1 Axial images from an abdominal CT scan demonstrate a 2.6×2.9×2.7 cm left adrenal mass.

One month after surgery the morning serum cortisol concentration was 11 mcg/dL (normal，7-25 mcg/dL)， and treatment with prednisone was discontinued. There was dramatic improvement in her degree of hirsutism over the next 6 months， and regular menstrual cycles returned. She was followed with serial measurement of serum testosterone and CT imaging of the chest， abdomen， and pelvis. At last follow-up， 4 years after surgery the serum testoster-one concentration was normal at 10 ng/dL and CT of the chest， abdomen， and pelvis showed no evidence of tumor recurrence.\n\n【14】**_Key Points_**\n\n【15】●Premenopausal androgen hypersecretion may be due to an ovarian tumor， an adrenal tumor， poly-cystic ovarian syndrome， or nonclassic congeni-tal adrenal hyperplasia.

The hospital recommended house quarantine and gave the treatment of Oseltamivir 1 tablet, two times daily; Moxifloxacin 1 tablet, once a day; and Lianhua Qingwen capsule 4 capsules, three times a day. However, the effect was still not obvious. On February 1st and February 2nd, the patient made two visits to the Wuhan No. 4 Hospital; since the effect of using Levofloxacin intravenous infusion was unsatisfactory, he was transferred to our hospital for further diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【11】Since the onset of illness, the patient’s energy, appetite, and sleep had been poor; he had no abnormality in defecation and urination, and no weight loss. His past medical history included 5 years of hypertension, with the highest blood pressure of 200/140 mmHg; he took amlodipine 1 tablet a day continually to control blood pressure and maintained it within 130–150/90–100 mmHg. He had 5 years of type 2 diabetes; no drug was taken for it, and his blood glucose level was unknown. He had no history of surgery or trauma. Because of his occupation as a taxi driver, he was not sure whether he had engaged with people who had been in the South China seafood market. He had no family member with a history of pneumonia recently. There was no history of drug allergy.\n\n【12】### Patient’s Condition on Admission\n\n【13】At the time of admission, the patient had low energy, with no fever, no cough or expectoration, no dyspnea, no dryness and bitterness in the mouth, no nausea or vomiting, no abnormal urination, but he had loose stools twice a day. The tongue was dark red, with a white and thick coating , and the pulse was slippery.\n\n【14】The physical examination was as follows: a body temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate 84 times per min, respiratory rate 22 times per min, blood pressure 148/94 mmHg, and blood oxygen saturation (in the resting state) was 86%.\n\n【15】Figure 2-6-1. Tongue on admission.\n\n【16】### Admission Diagnosis\n\n【17】① COVID-19 (severe type). ② Type 2 diabetes. ③ Hypertension (Level 3, very high risk).\n\n【18】### Treatment Plan\n\n【19】At the time of admission, the patient suffered from chest stuffiness and dyspnea. In the resting state, the blood oxygen saturation was 86%. Nasogastric oxygen (5 L per min) was given and then a blood oxygen saturation of 96% was obtained. CBC was checked after admission: white blood cell count (WBC) 9.48 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, platelet count 242 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, absolute value of neutrophil 8.45 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, absolute value of lymphocyte 0.60 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, plasma prothrombin time 12.3 seconds, fibrinogen concentration 5.3 g/L, D-dimer 1.79 ug/ml; erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 26mm/h; blood biochemistry: ALT 34 u/L, AST 59 u/L, albumin 30.4 g/L, urea 21.60 mmol/L, creatinine 392.9 umol/L, uric acid 792 umol/L, creatine kinase 1819 u/L, creatine kinase isoenzyme 34 u/L, lactate dehydrogenase 714 u/L, amyloid A 198.4 mg/L, hypersensitive C-reactive protein >160.0 mg/L, myoglobin 436.1 ng/mL. The COVID-19 nucleic acid test was positive, and the chest CT scan showed double-lung infectious lesions, considered viral pneumonia, and bilateral pleural thickening .\n\n【20】Figure 2-6-2. The chest CT examination on February 5th.\n\n【21】_Note_ : The transparency of both the lungs is reduced, and extensive patchy shadows can be observed in both the lungs.\n\n【22】### Western Medicine Treatment Strategies\n\n【23】通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Combined with symptoms (fever before admission, cough, dyspnea, and loose stools) and lab results (positive for COVID-19 nucleic acid test, inflammatory exudation at bilateral lung(s) in chest CT), COVID-19 was diagnosed clearly.\n\n【24】通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> Severity evaluation: this patient was diagnosed as a critical case. According to the 5th edition of the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for COVID-19, critical cases should meet at least one of the following criteria: ① respiratory failure and requiring mechanical ventilation; ② shock; ③ other organ failures; ICU monitoring and treatment are needed. Supportive evidence including the blood oxygen saturation of the patient of 86% while he was breathing ambient air and the creatinine of 392.9 umol/L when he was admitted to the hospital caused us to suspect that he had acute viral renal injury. At the expert case discussion forum on February 6th, according to the increased percentage of neutrophils combined with the patient’s results of chest CT scan, it was pointed out that the virus was complicated with bacterial infection; then Moxifloxacin sodium chloride injection was given 0.4 g intravenously once a day for anti-infection. By the results of blood biochemistry, the renal damage caused by the virus infection was not excluded.\n\n【25】### TCM Treatment Strategies\n\n【26】#### _02/04/2020_\n\n【27】The symptoms of dark red tongue with whitish thick greasy fur and slippery pulse of the patient were integrated into the syndrome belonging to cold-damp constraint in the lungs with Qi stagnation and blood stasis in TCM. The treatment was the prescription (Granule No.1) for the syndrome of cold dampness stagnating in the lungs, which was based on the 4th edition of the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for COVID-19, the Traditional Chinese medicine part. Granule No. 1 is modified from Shen-Zhu Powder, and _the Taiping Huiming Heji Jufang (Prescriptions of Peaceful Benevolent Dispensary)_ Shen-Zhu Powder is composed of Cang Zhu (Rhizoma atractylodes), Bai Zhi (Angelica dahurica), Chuan Xiong (Ligusticum wallichii), Qiang Huo (Rhizoma seu Radix Notopterygii), Xi Xin (Asarum), etc. It has the effect of resolving turbidity with its fragrant herbs, regulating Qi, and activating blood, with addition of Hou Pou (Magnolia officinalis), Cao Guo (Amomum tsao-ko), and Bing Lang (Areca catechu), which are the main herbs for Deep-reaching decoction in Granule No. 1 to regulate Qi and resolve turbidity, and further inclusion of Sheng Mahuang (raw ephedra) and Sheng Jiang (ginger) to disperse external pathogen factors. The proposed decoction for the patient was as follows:\n\n【28】Cang Zhu (Rhizoma Atractylodes) 15 g, Chen Pi (Tangerine peel) 10 g, Hou Pou (Magnolia Officinalis) 10 g, Huo Xiang (Agastache Rugos) 10 g, Cao Guo (Amomum Tsao-ko) 6 g, Sheng Mahuang (raw Ephedra) 6 g, Qiang Huo (Radix Notopterygii) 10 g, Sheng Jiang (Ginger) 10 g, Bing Lang (Areca Catechu) 10 g.\n\n【29】It was in granule form, 3 doses, one dose daily, divided into equal parts for morning and evening.\n\n【30】A lot of exudation showed in his chest CT, and he was given 0.9% sodium chloride injection 250 ml with Xiyanping injection 150 ml, intravenous drip, once a day, to achieve heat-clearing and detoxification effects, and 0.9% sodium chloride injection 100 ml with Xuebijing injection 100 ml, intravenous drip, once a day, for promoting blood circulation and removing stasis. On February 6th, his blood biochemical examination showed urea 15.50 mmol/L, creatinine 237.0 _μ_ mol/L, uric acid 560 _μ_ mol/L, and creatine kinase 468 u/L. On February 10th, lab results showed urea 4.02 mmol/L, creatinine 122.0 _μ_ mol/L, uric acid 324 _μ_ mol/L, and creatine kinase 73 u/L.\n\n【31】#### _02/11/2020_\n\n【32】The patient’s symptoms improved, with good energy, sufficient sleep, no fever for 6 days, no expectoration and obvious dyspnea, no dry and bitter mouth, no nausea or vomiting, and with the normal urination, but mild cough and loose stools twice a day. His blood oxygen saturation was 98% under the condition of 3 L/min oxygen inhalation with a nasal catheter, and his WBC was in the normal range in the lab result. The test for COVID-19 nucleic acid was negative. So, we stopped moxifloxacin, and altered the patient’s condition from critical to severe. According to TCM, the proposed decoction given above was prescribed.\n\n【33】#### _02/12/2020_\n\n【34】The patient was in normal consciousness, had good energy with good sleep, mild cough, no expectoration and obvious dyspnea, dark red tongue with whitish greasy fur, and slippery pulse. The physical examination was as follows: body temperature 36.3°C, heart rate 81 times per min, respiratory rate 24 times per min, and blood pressure 123/82 mmHg. Blood oxygen saturation was 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Chest CT scan returned the following results: bilateral pulmonary interstitial inflammation, slightly better than the absorption of lesions on February 5th, with partial pulmonary interstitial fibrosis; it was considered to be viral pneumonia; there was slight bilateral pleural adhesion . The COVID-19 nucleic acid test was negative. According to TCM, we continued with the same prescription given above.\n\n【35】Figure 2-6-3. The chest CT examination on February 12th.\n\n【36】_Note_ : The transparency of both the lungs had reduced, and cloudy opacity shadows can be seen in both the lungs, with exudation better absorbed than before.\n\n【37】#### _02/14/2020_\n\n【38】The patient’s consciousness was clear and he had good energy. It was the 9th day without fever symptoms. The patient was coughing occasionally. He had no obvious dyspnea, dry mouth, bitter mouth, nausea, vomiting, and no abnormality in excretion. His tongue was dark red with yellow and greasy fur, and his pulse was slippery. The physical examination was as follows: body temperature 36.4°C, heart rate 87 times per min, respiratory rate 23 times per min, and blood pressure 121/85 mmHg. He had 96% saturation of blood oxygen at 3 L/min oxygen inhalation by the nasal catheter. According to the tongue coating, we considered that heat was transformed from dampness and toxin in the body. Then, a decoction named “Huashi Baidu Decoction” was provided for him. The specific formula was as follows:\n\n【39】Sheng Mahuang (raw Ephedra) 6 g, Xing Ren (Apricot Kernel) 9 g, Shi Gao (Gypsum) 15 g, Gan Cao (Liquorice) 3 g, Huo Xiang (Agastache Rugosus) 10 g (decocted later), Hou Pou (Magnolia Officinalis) 10 g, Cang Zhu (Rhizoma Atractylodes) 15 g, Cao Guo (Amomum Tsao-ko) 10 g, Fa Banxia (Rhizome of Pinellinae) 9 g, Fu Ling (Poria Cocos) 15 g, Sheng Dahuang (Rheum Officinale) 5 g (decocted later), Sheng Huangqi (Membranous Milkvetch root) 10 g, Ting Lizi (Lepidium seed) 10 g, Chi Shao (red Peony roots) 10 g.\n\n【40】It was given as granules, 5 doses, one dose daily, divided into equal parts for morning and evening.\n\n【41】#### _02/17/2020_\n\n【42】On February 15th, the patient had a blood biochemistry test with the following results: urea 3.64 mmol/L, creatinine 111.0 _μ_ mol/L, uric acid 345 _μ_ mol/L, creatine kinase 54 U/L, hypersensitive C-reactive protein 1.4 mg/L, and amyloid A 3.39 mg/L. He was in normal consciousness, had good energy, was sleeping well but coughing mildly, and had mild dyspnea after activities. He had no expectoration, dry mouth, bitter mouth, nausea, vomiting, and no abnormal excretion. The physical examination was as follows: body temperature 36.6°C, heart rate 72 times per min, respiratory rate 20 times per min, and blood pressure 120/85 mmHg. When he took oxygen, for 3 L/min intermittently by nasal catheter, his blood oxygen saturation was 99%. He had pharyngeal hyperemia, but no drowsiness, no cyanosis on his lips, no obvious enlargement of bilateral tonsils and no purulent secretion, but had a dark red tongue and a white greasy coating. The patient’s condition was stable, and he continued to take the “Huashi Baidu Decoction”, and was being carefully monitored. Re-examination result of chest CT was as follows: bilateral pulmonary interstitial inflammation, with partial pulmonary interstitial fibrosis, considered to be viral pneumonia, slightly better than the absorption of the lesion on February 12th, and bilateral pleural adhesion .\n\n【43】#### _02/19/2020_\n\n【44】Blood biochemistry test has the following result: ALT 36 U/L, AST 20 U/L, urea 5.38 mmol/L, creatinine 119.0 _μ_ mol/L, uric acid 352 _μ_ mol/L, hypersensitive C-reactive protein 1.5 mg/L, amyloid A 3.32 mg/L. Two consecutive COVID-19 nucleic acid tests, on February 19th and 20th, were negative. The patient was discharged on February 22nd without any special discomfort and his renal function was restored to the basic level. Considering the deficiency of lung Qi and spleen Qi (in TCM terms) in the patient, Granule No. 4 was given for 14 days while in quarantine. The specific formula was as follows:\n\n【45】Fa Banxia (Rhizome of Pinellinae) 9 g, Chen Pi (Tangerine peel) 10 g, Dang Shen (Codonopsis Pilosula) 15 g, Zhi Huangqi (Radix Astragali Preparata) 30 g, Fu Ling (Poria Cocos) 15 g, Huo Xiang (Agastache Rugosus) 10 g, Sha Ren (Fructus Amomum) 6 g (decocted later).\n\n【46】Figure 2-6-4. The chest CT examination on February 17th.\n\n【47】_Note_ : The transparency of both the lungs had slightly decreased, and cloudy opaque shadows can be seen in both the lungs, better absorbed than before.\n\n【48】It was given as granules, 14 doses, one dose daily, divided into equal parts for morning and evening.\n\n【49】### Evaluation of Effectiveness\n\n【50】1\\. Changes in main symptoms\n\n【51】On the 8th day of hospitalization, the stuffiness and dyspnea were obviously improved, and the patient could be given oxygen inhalation intermittently, also, the cough was improved, and stools were transformed from loose to normal. There was no discomfort at discharge.\n\n【52】2\\. Laboratory results\n\n【53】After 5 days of taking medicine, the inflammatory index gradually decreased, and the neutrophil count and lymphocyte count decreased apparently, indicating that the patient’s condition improved significantly . The hypersensitive C-reactive protein and amyloid protein A showed a sharp decrease, which was consistent with the change of CBC indexes, and the inflammation was obviously improved . The indexes of the heart and kidney functions decreased significantly. Heart and kidney functions recovered well .\n\n【54】3\\.

Variation curve of renal function index.\n\n【58】Figure 2-6-8. Tongue at discharge.\n\n【59】### Patient’s Condition at Discharge\n\n【60】At discharge, the patient had good energy and sleep, and was occasionally coughing. He had no expectoration, no dry and bitter mouth, no abdominal pain and chest oppression, no nausea and vomiting, and no abnormality in the excretion. His tongue was dim with white thin fur, and the pulse was thin and slippery . The physical examination was as follows: body temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate 85 times per min, respiratory rate 22 times per min, and blood pressure 127/80 mmHg. The blood oxygen saturation was 98% while he was breathing ambient air. The COVID-19 nucleic acid test was negative. After discharge, he proceeded to quarantine himself at the designated point and we conducted telephonic follow-up.\n\n【61】### Case Analysis\n\n【62】通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> This was a critical patient with hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. He had a serious bilateral lung infection, exudation, and consolidation, accompanied by acute renal injury and blood creatinine of 392.9 umol/L. According to his high percentage of blood neutrophil, combining results of chest CT with consultation, experts pointed out that the virus being complicated with bacterial infection could not be excluded. Then, we treated him with moxifloxacin for 5 days. Chinese medicine Granule No. 1 is a prescription for dispersing Lung Qi and dampness and detoxification, and Xiyanping (injection) for detoxification combined with Xuebijing (injection) for blood activation. The patient’s condition improved rapidly and the acute renal injury recovered with blood creatinine recovery to basic levels. After discharge, TCM Granule No. 4 was used as aftercare.\n\n【63】通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> The syndrome of cold-damp constraint in the lungs with stagnation of Qi and blood stasis should be considered, with the evidence of the tongue being dark red, with a coating that was white thick and greasy, and a pulse that was slippery. Toxin dampness led to failure of the lungs to disperse and descend; disorder of lung-Qi; imbalance of ascending, descending, exiting, and entering functions of lung-qi; and maladjustment in the distribution of water and fluid. Zongqi in the lungs failed in helping the heart to move blood. The lungs are similar as a blower; if the terminal pulmonary alveolus is blocked with Qi and blood, less air can be blown, followed by anoxia and blood stasis. After that, the formed dampness, blood stasis, and epidemic toxin further aggravate the disorder of lung Qi and form a vicious circle. Therefore, TCM Granule No. 1 has a good effect on promoting the lungs and dissipating dampness, combined better with Xiyanping injection for detoxification and Xuebijing injection for promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis. Dynamic syndrome differentiation is based on the changes of the patient’s condition during hospitalization. With a transformation to a yellow and greasy coating, toxic dampness converting into heat, the treatment was changed into Huashi Baidu decoction to promote the lungs and dissipate dampness, and clear and remove stagnated heat, which reached a satisfactory curative effect.\n\n【64】(Wensheng Qi, Jinliang Yang, Jiaheng Shi, Xinting Liu, Chen Hu)", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Phototherapy for Vitiligo\n=============================\n\n【3】John Koo <sup>1 <span class=\"ContactIcon\"></span></sup> and Mio Nakamura通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>1</sup></u>\n\n【4】通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>\n\n【5】Psoriasis and Skin Treatment Center, Department of Dermatology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA\n\n【6】Case\n----\n\n【7】A 28-year-old male presents for a one-year history of vitiligo. The skin around his mouth, both hands, and scattered spots on the trunk are affected. He has tried topical corticosteroids, as well as tacrolimus ointment and pimecrolimus cream, without much improvement. He is very anxious, and he believes that his vitiligo is rapidly spreading up his hands to his wrists. He asks if there is anything other than topical medications that can help his vitiligo.\n\n【8】The patient is started on NB-UVB phototherapy twice weekly at 130 mJ/cm <sup>2 </sup> , which is increased as tolerated by approximately 20 mJ/cm <sup>2 </sup> depending on the response to previous therapies. As the dosage is increased, the affected skin becomes erythematous and islands of re-pigmentation are observed. He continues to use topical medications at home. At his three-month follow up visit, the patient has significant visible repigmentation of his vitiligo, especially on his face and hands, which he is very happy about . He is continued on twice weekly phototherapy treatments until the majority of his lesions are re-pigmented and then maintained on once weekly treatments.\n\n【9】Figure 25.1\n\n【10】Islands of repigmentation observed after NB-UVB treatments\n\n【11】Discussion\n----------\n\n【12】Vitiligo is a dermatologic condition characterized by well-circumscribed white macules and patches due to destruction of melanocytes. The exact pathophysiologic mechanism is unknown. Vitiligo is estimated to affect up to 2% of the population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The disfigurement caused by vitiligo has significant negative impact on quality of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】Topical treatments for vitiligo include corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors. Traditionally, PUVA was considered mainstay treatment; however, in 1997, Westerhof and Nieuweboer-Krobotova reported the first use of NB-UVB for the treatment of vitiligo 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Since then, NB-UVB has become first-line therapy for generalized vitiligo in adults, and as an alternative therapy after class-III corticosteroids have failed for vitiligo in children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】A number of studies have reported effectiveness of NB-UVB alone or in combination with topical therapies for the treatment of vitiligo 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. Furthermore, NB-UVB has been shown to be comparable or have slightly better efficacy than PUVA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. More recently, the excimer laser has become an effective and advantageous phototherapy modality for localized vitiligo as it can deliver targeted therapy directly to lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Home phototherapy can also be utilized for treatment of vitiligo in selected patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Studies have shown that patients with skin that tans easily may respond more favorably to phototherapy, as well as lesions in certain locations such as the face 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Furthermore, it has been shown that a shorter period before initial repigmentation correlates with a higher percentage of final repigmentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】The dosimetry for NB-UVB varies but typically started at 130 mJ/cm <sup>2 </sup> for the initial dose irrespective of skin type, which is increased by 15–50 mJ/cm <sup>2 </sup> at each subsequent session as tolerated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The dose should be increased until mild erythema develops and then kept stable. The dosing protocol for vitiligo used at the UCSF Phototherapy Unit is shown in Table 25.1 , along with the missed treatment protocol in Table 25.2 . The excimer laser is also effective for localized vitiligo. The dosing is based on the location of the vitiligo and each laser manufacturer’s recommendations. 2 or 3 times per week treatments over several months is necessary for adequate response, followed by a possible ongoing maintenance regimen of once weekly. Side effects include burning and erythema, as well as photoaging and photodamage. Some patients may perceive initial worsening of their vitiligo due to tanning of surrounding skin and should be reassured accordingly.\n\n【16】Table 25.1\n\n【17】Phototherapy dosimetry protocol for vitiligo used at UCSF Phototherapy Unit\n\n|  | Initial dose (mJ/cm 2 ) | Subsequent dose increase a (mJ/cm 2 ) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| NB-UVB | 130 | 15–50 |\n| PUVA | 0.25 | 0.25–0.5 |\n\n【19】<sup>a </sup> Dose is increased until mild erythema of the vitiligo patch is observed\n\n【20】Table 25.2\n\n【21】Missed treatment protocol for vitiligo at UCSF Phototherapy Unit\n\n| Missed visit | Action (for all skin types) |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1–7 days | Increase dose per protocol |\n| 8–11 days | Hold dose constant |\n| 12–20 days | Decrease by 25% |\n| 21–27 days | Decrease by 50% |\n| 28 or more days | Restart with initial dose |\n\n【23】The current patient who has widespread vitiligo affecting multiple locations such as the face, hands, and trunk, and has failed topical therapies, is a good candidate for NB-UVB phototherapy. If his lesions were more localized, excimer laser would be a good alternative. Before starting phototherapy, it is important to discuss with the patient the expectations that consistent treatments 2 to 3 times per week for several months is necessary to see good results. Furthermore, ongoing maintenance may be required in the long term. If the patient is found to respond well to office based NB-UVB, it may be beneficial to consider a home phototherapy unit for long-term management. As combination therapy with topical medications appears to be safe and effective, topical therapies should be continued along with phototherapy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

During your preoperative assessment， a 72-year-old man complains of dyspnea on exertion and intermittent chest pain. Upon auscultation of his heart， you notice a mid-systolic crescendo-decrescendo murmur that radiates to his carotid. This murmur is most characteristic of which valyular lesion?\n\n【1】**A. Mitral stenosis**\n\n【2】B. Mitral regurgitation\n\n【3】C. Aortic regurgitation\n\n【4】**D. Aortic stenosis**\n\n【5】17.2. What statement about the pathophysiology of aortic stenosis is most likely true?\n\n【6】A. PatientsSwith aortic stenosis have decreased myocardial oxygen demand as the left ventricular hypertrophy offers a“protective”effect.\n\n【7】B.The increased pressure gradient between the left ventricle and aorta results in eccentric left ventricular hypertrophy.\n\n【8】C. Patients with aortic stenosis can develop impaired left ventricular filling because of diastolic dysfunction.\n\n【9】D. Myocardial ischemia in aortic stenosis is rare in the absence of coronary artery disease.\n\n【10】17.3. You will be taking care of a 72-year-old woman with a history of severe aortic stenosis (valve area 0.7 cm) for a laparoscopic cholecystec-tomy. You are planning a general anesthetic with sevoflurane. What will be the hemodynamic goal for this patient?\n\n【11】A. Low systemic vascular resistance\n\n【12】B. Heart rate between 60 to 75 beats per minute\n\n【13】C. Low preload\n\n【14】**D. Increased contractility**\n\n【15】17.4. During insufflation of the peritoneum with carbon dioxide， the patient becomes hypotensive (blood pressure 60/48) while the heart rate remains unchanged at 84 beats per minute. You ask the surgeon to decrease the pneumoperitoneum； however， the blood pressure remains low. Which of the following would be the best course of action?\n\n【16】A. Administer an alpha-agonist drug such as phenylephrine.\n\n【17】B.Administer nitroglycerin.\n\n【18】C. Administer a beta agonist， such as dobutamine.\n\n【19】D. Administer an inotropic agent such as epinephrine.\n\n【20】**ANSWERS**\n\n【21】17.1. D. The murmur described is characteristic of aortic stenosis. The murmur of mitral stenosis is a mid-diastolic rumbling murmur， best heard at the apex with the patient in the left lateral position. The murmur of mitral regurgitation is typically a holosystolic murmur that may radiate to the axilla. The murmur associated with aortic regurgitation is a mid-systolic ejection murmur generally heard best at the base of the heart and is transmitted to the jugular notch.\n\n【22】17.2. C. The pathophysiology of aortic stenosis involves left ventricular out-flow obstruction with the subsequent development of a pressure gradi-ent between the left ventricle and the aorta. This results in concentric left ventricle hypertrophy rather than an eccentric hypertrophy. As a result of left ventricular hypertrophy， myocardial oxygen consumption is increased and patients can develop myocardial ischemia as a result of increased myocardial oxygen consumption and decreased myocar-dial oxygen supply. Also as a result of left ventricular hypertrophy， ven-tricular relaxation and filling during diastole is impaired.\n\n【23】17.3. B. The hemodynamic goals for patients with aortic stenosis include maintenance of preload， systemic vascular resistance， contractility， and a sinus rhythm， as well as the avoidance of tachycardia. Because of their relatively fixed stroke volume， patients with aortic stenosis are dependent on adequate filling/preload. Tachycardia and rhythms other than sinus rhythm (ie， atrial fibrillation) are poorly tolerated and can be harmful. Patients with aortic stenosis have a fixed resistance at the\n\n【24】level of the aortic valve； thus， maintenance of systemic vascular resist-ance is important to preserve diastolic coronary perfusion gradients. In patients with aortic stenosis， contractility should be preserved.\n\n【25】17.4. A. Hypotension is poorly tolerated in patients with severe aortic stenosis. Myocardial ischemia can develop rapidly； hence prompt recognition and treatment of hypotension is critical. In contrast to inotropic agents such as epinephrine or dobutamine， alpha agonists such as phenylephrine are generally regarded as the treatment of choice for hypotension， to restore coronary perfusion pressure.

She is naturally petite and had developed gestational diabetes, which was not \n\n【3】detected until 30 weeks into her pregnancy. She was then referred to a specialist obstetrician \n\n【4】as her pregnancy was considered high risk.\n\n【5】As Rachel had been diagnosed with gestational diabetes she was more likely to have a larger \n\n【6】baby. In her case this was particularly worrisome due to her small frame. She was consid￾ered at significant risk of the baby developing shoulder dystocia (the shoulder getting stuck) \n\n【7】during delivery. This is a major obstetric emergency associated with short- and long-term \n\n【8】neonatal and maternal morbidity and associated neonatal mortality.\n\n【9】Although Rachel was told that she was having a larger-than-usual baby, she was not told \n\n【10】about the risks of her experiencing mechanical problems during labour and she was not told \n\n【11】about the risk of shoulder dystocia. Rachel had repeatedly expressed concerns about the size \n\n【12】of the foetus and about the risk that the baby might be too big to be delivered vaginally but \n\n【13】she had not asked her consultant specifically about this risk.\n\n【14】During the birth the baby did develop shoulder dystocia. There was a 15-minute delay \n\n【15】between  the baby’s head appearing and the delivery, and during this time the baby was \n\n【16】deprived of oxygen. At a few months old, her son was diagnosed as suffering from severe \n\n【17】cerebral palsy, caused by deprivation of oxygen. If Rachel had been given the option of having \n\n【18】an elective caesarean section her son would have been born uninjured.\n\n【19】Questions\n\n【20】• What information should be discussed with patients prior to consent for a \n\n【21】procedure?\n\n【22】• What if a patient does not ask questions about risks?\n\n【23】• Can a doctor not disclose information about risks if he thinks that information will \n\n【24】be harmful to the patient?112\n\n【25】100 Cases in Clinical Ethics and Law\n\n【26】ANSWER 42\n\n【27】The law on disclosure of information is generally considered to be founded on the patient’s \n\n【28】‘right to choose’ whether or not to have a particular treatment. To make an autonomous \n\n【29】choice, the patient must be able to understand and reason and therefore needs sufficient \n\n【30】information to be able to do so. The healthcare professional’s legal duty of care includes the \n\n【31】duty to disclose information of inherent risks, alternative treatment(s) and comparative risks \n\n【32】of different treatment options and the implications of non-treatment.\n\n【33】A failure to disclose such information deprives the patient of the opportunity to decide \n\n【34】whether they are willing to undertake the risks of treatment. A patient who has consented to \n\n【35】a procedure, having been informed in broad terms of the nature and purpose of the proce￾dure, has given valid consent (Case 25); but the patient has a claim in negligence if they can \n\n【36】show that the doctor breached his duty by failing to provide enough information and that \n\n【37】if the patient had been properly informed they would not have agreed to the treatment or \n\n【38】procedure, thus avoiding the risk that in fact did materialise.\n\n【39】What information must be disclosed?\n\n【40】GMC guidance (Consent: patients and doctors making decisions together, 2008) advises that \n\n【41】the doctor must tell patients if treatment might result in a serious adverse outcome, even if \n\n【42】the risk is very small, and should also tell patients about less serious complications if they \n\n【43】occur frequently. The BMA states that ‘the amount of information doctors provide to each \n\n【44】patient will vary according to factors such as the nature and severity of the condition, the \n\n【45】complexity of the treatment, the risks associated with the treatment or procedure and the \n\n【46】patient’s own wishes’ (BMA Consent tool kit). A healthcare professional will breach his duty \n\n【47】if he has fallen below the requisite standard of disclosure. Numerous cases have considered \n\n【48】the standard of disclosure of information. The Supreme Court decision of Montgomery v \n\n【49】Lanarkshire Health Board 通用删除7(英):<u>(2015)</u> reviews the prior case law and gives a judgment strongly \n\n【50】focusing on provision of information which is sufficient to protect the patient’s right of \n\n【51】autonomy and her freedom to decide what shall and shall not be done with her body.\n\n【52】A doctor is under a duty to take reasonable care to ensure that the patient is aware of any \n\n【53】material risks involved in any recommended treatment and of any reasonable alternative or \n\n【54】variant treatments. The test of materiality is whether, in the circumstances of the particular \n\n【55】case, a reasonable person in the patient’s position would be likely to attach significance to \n\n【56】the risk, or the doctor is or should reasonably be aware that the particular patient would be \n\n【57】likely to attach significance to it.\n\n【58】Montgomery v Lanarkshire Health Board 通用删除7(英):<u>(2015)</u>\n\n【59】Whether a risk is material does not depend solely on the statistical magnitude of risk. In \n\n【60】the past a 10% risk of stroke was considered material and should therefore be disclosed. \n\n【61】Montgomery v Lanarkshire Health Board identifies that whether a risk is material depends \n\n【62】on the magnitude of risk to the patient and so is sensitive to the needs, concerns and \n\n【63】circumstances of the individual patient, to the extent that they are or ought to be known to \n\n【64】the doctor.\n\n【65】To understand the importance of potential harms of treatment for the patient requires a \n\n【66】dialogue and ‘the exchange of information between doctor and patient is central to good 113\n\n【67】Ethics and Law in Clinical Practice: Negligence\n\n【68】decision-making’ (GMC, Consent: patients and doctors making decisions together, 2008). \n\n【69】Information should be given in a manner that is readily understandable by the patient, and \n\n【70】consideration should be given to issues of language, cognitive ability and stress of the patient. \n\n【71】The duty to disclose will not be fulfilled if the doctor merely bombards the patient with tech￾nical information which the patient does not understand.\n\n【72】Asking questions\n\n【73】If the patient asks questions, they must be answered fully and truthfully. Rachel had raised \n\n【74】general concerns but had not asked specific questions about the baby getting stuck during \n\n【75】delivery. In Montgomery it was noted that ‘the more a patient knows about the risks she \n\n【76】faces, the easier it is for her to ask specific questions about those risks, so as to impose on her \n\n【77】doctor a duty to provide information; but it is those who lack such knowledge, and who are in \n\n【78】consequence unable to pose such questions and instead express their anxiety in more general \n\n【79】terms, who are in the greatest need of information’.\n\n【80】Therapeutic privilege\n\n【81】It could be argued that a patient may be unduly alarmed by disclosure of serious risks \n\n【82】of treatment even if they are statistically unlikely to occur, thus perhaps resulting in the \n\n【83】patient forgoing treatment which is considered beneficial. ‘Therapeutic privilege’ refers to the \n\n【84】withholding of information by the clinician during the consent process in the belief that dis￾closure of this information would lead to the harm or suffering of the patient. The GMC says \n\n【85】that information necessary to make a decision should not be withheld ‘unless you believe that \n\n【86】giving it would cause the patient serious harm. In this context “serious harm” means more \n\n【87】than that the patient might become upset or decide to refuse treatment’ (GMC, Consent: \n\n【88】patients and doctors making decisions together, 2008). There is no justification for a doctor to \n\n【89】fail to disclose material information because he believes the patient may choose an alternative \n\n【90】treatment which he thinks is contrary to their best interests.\n\n【91】The virtue of trust in the doctor–patient relationship depends on open, frank dialogue. This \n\n【92】also allows the doctor to discuss with the patient which specific risks may be important to \n\n【93】them. A consequentialist may argue that better outcomes are achieved by advancing patient \n\n【94】choices in healthcare decision making. It is important to be aware that for some patients, \n\n【95】discussion about a large number of serious risks can be so overwhelming that the patient \n\n【96】becomes too scared to make any decision. Time should be given for reflection and discussion \n\n【97】of these fears. In practice, how and where information is discussed is as important as the \n\n【98】information itself.\n\n【99】Key Points\n\n【100】• Dialogue with patients is key in order to gain some understanding of the issues \n\n【101】which are important to them.\n\n【102】• The setting and manner of information provision are important factors.\n\n【103】• The discussion and outcome must be clearly documented in the medical notes \n\n【104】and on the consent form.115\n\n【105】Ethics and Law in Clinical Practice: Negligence", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

It is one of the leading causes of acute liver failure. \n\n【21】The key aspects of dealing with a suspected paracetamol overdose are a thorough history, \n\n【22】complete physical examination and prompt investigations. The aim of the history is to deter￾mine the quantity and chronology of the tablets taken, as well as to ascertain whether the \n\n【23】patient has risk factors for hepatotoxicity (e.g. background liver disease, malnourishment, \n\n【24】excess alcohol consumption, enzyme-inducing medication). Physical examination is directed \n\n【25】mainly at evaluating for possible liver disease, while the key investigations that need to be \n\n【26】performed are 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> urinalysis (for ketones), 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> timed serum paracetamol level, 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> liver function, \n\n【27】通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> clotting screen (a marker of synthetic liver function) and 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> renal function. \n\n【28】The clinical features of paracetamol overdose are dependent on time. In the first 24 hours, \n\n【29】patients may complain of nausea or vomiting, while serum transaminases may start to rise. \n\n【30】One to two days post-overdose, abdominal signs and symptoms increase, with a continued \n\n【31】rise in transaminases and possible evidence of liver dysfunction (coagulopathy). After this \n\n【32】time, untreated patients may develop acute liver failure, with ensuing coagulopathy encepha￾lopathy, and renal failure. \n\n【33】The recommended dosing of paracetamol is a maximum dose of 4 g a day for adults. \n\n【34】Normally, the drug is metabolised by cytochrome P4502E1 to form a reactive metabolite, \n\n【35】N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI), which can be hepatotoxic. However, NAPQI is \n\n【36】detoxified by glutathione, and hence, when there are sufficient amounts of the latter, the \n\n【37】liver is not damaged. Overdoses of the drug deplete glutathione stores, and hepatic damage \n\n【38】results. Glutathione stores also depend on nutritional status, which is why it is important to \n\n【39】assess for background risk of liver damage. \n\n【40】The key investigation for paracetamol overdose is measurement of paracetamol concentra￾tion in the blood 4–16 hours post-dose. Levels taken before 4 hours are inaccurate due to \n\n【41】incomplete absorption, while those taken after 16 hours may be falsely high due to the liver \n\n【42】injury that may have occurred. If levels are higher than the treatment threshold, the patient \n\n【43】requires treatment with three sequential intravenous infusions of acetylcysteine, which can \n\n【44】replenish glutathione stores. Additionally, all suspected paracetamol overdose patients require \n\n【45】fluid replacement. If paracetamol has been taken in the past hour, activated charcoal may \n\n【46】be of use in limiting drug absorption. In cases where the timing of the paracetamol dose(s) is \n\n【47】unknown, treatment with acetylcysteine should be started immediately in any patient who is \n\n【48】at potential risk. If risk assessment is uncertain, the latest guidelines allow for treatment with \n\n【49】acetylcysteine irrespective of the plasma paracetamol level. \n\n【50】KEY POINTS \n\n【51】• The most common drug taken in overdose in the UK is paracetamol. \n\n【52】• The mechanism of paracetamol toxicity is via depletion of glutathione stores, \n\n【53】which helps detoxify NAPQI, a metabolite of the drug. \n\n【54】• Paracetamol levels need to be measured between 4 and 16 hours after the last \n\n【55】dose in order to decide whether treatment is required.  \n\n【56】 ", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

However an equally important task is to distinguish poten-tially dangerous antigens from those that are harmless. Countless innocuous for-eign antigens are encountered every day by the lungs， gut， and skin， the interfaces between the body and the environment. Similarly， the body contains numerous self antigens that might bind to the specific antigen receptors on B and T cells. Activation of the immune system by such innocuous antigens is unnecessary and may lead to unwanted inflammation. Allergic and autoimmune diseases are well-known examples of such unwanted and potentially destructive responses.**\n\n【4】Fortunately， unwanted immune responses are normally prevented or regulated by the phenomenon of immunologic tolerance. This is defined as nonresponsive-ness of the lymphocyte population to the specific antigen， and arises at two stages of lymphocyte development. Central tolerance is the result of the removal of self-reactive lymphocytes in the central organs； an autoimmune disease due to a defect in central tolerance is described in Case 17. Peripheral tolerance， in contrast， inac-tivates those T and B cells that escape central tolerance and exit to the periphery. Defects in either central or peripheral tolerance can result in unwanted or exces-sive immune responses.\n\n【5】Several mechanisms of peripheral tolerance exist . One is the network of regulatory cells that prevent or limit the activation of T cells， including self-reactive T cells， and the consequent destructive inflammatory processes. When these regulatory cells do not function properly， problems can arise. A key cell type\n\n【6】**Fig. 18.1 Mechanisms of peripheral immunologic tolerance.

T cells that express Fas (CD95) on their surface can receive signals from cells that express Fas ligand， leading to**\n\n【7】their deletion. The activation of naive T cells can be inhibited if the cell-surface protein CTLA-4 (CD152) binds B7.1 (CD80) on antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Regulatory T cells (mainly CD4CD25 Foxp3-expressing) can inhibit， or suppress， other T cells， most probably through the production of inhibitory cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-B.\n\n【8】responsible for the maintenance of peripheral tolerance is the CD4 CD25 regu-latory T cell (Treg)， also known as the natural regulatory T cell. Natural Treg cells， which represent only 5% to 10% of circulating T cells， seem to become committed to a regulatory fate while still in the thymus.\n\n【9】**Natural Treg cells are CD4\\* CD25+ cells that express the transcription factor Foxp3， which is essential for their specification and function as regulatory cells. Over the past decade it has emerged that these cells are crucial to the maintenance of peripheral tolerance. Neonatal thymectomy in mice and thymic hypoplasia in humans (DiGeorge syndrome； see Case 9) result in impaired generation of natural Treg cells and the development of organ-specific autoimmune disease. The genera-tion of natural Treg cells in the thymus requires interaction with self-peptide：MHC class II complexes on cortical epithelial cells.**\n\n【10】**A second group of regulatory T cells seems to be induced from naive CD4 T cells in theperiphery. Thesecells are CD4\\*CD25-andareheterogeneous， including TGF-B-(TH3) and IL-10-secreting (TR1) subsets. Recently， a novel and rare population of Treg cells that are CD8-positive has been described. Whereas CD4 Treg subsets have been extensively studied， less is known about CD8 Treg cells， their subsets， and their modes of action. NK cells and NKT cells have also been shown to be able to regulate immune responses. As a group， regulatory cells represent just one mecha-nism in a complex system of immunologic tolerance， acting to prevent or rein in unwanted immune responses.**\n\n【11】**The following case illustrates how a breakdown in peripheral tolerance as a result of a defect in regulatory T cells leads to a constellation of allergic symptoms， gastro-intestinal symptoms， and autoimmune disease in infancy.**\n\n【12】**The case of Billy Shepherd： a defect in peripheral tolerance leading to dermatitis， diarrhea， and diabetes.**\n\n【13】**Billy was born at full term and developed atopic dermatitis shortly after birth. This was treated by skin hydration and by local application of hydrocortisone and anti- _histamines to control itching； the treatment was only partly successful. At 4 months_ of age， Billy developed an intractable watery diarrhea. Although he had initially gained weight well， by now his weight had fallen below the third centile for his age. _At 6 months old， Billy started to develop high blood glucose levels and glucose in_ the urine. He was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes (insulin-dependent diabetes mel-litus) and was referred by his pediatrician to the endocrine clinic at the Children’s Hospital.**\n\n【14】**When first seen at the clinic， Billy weighed 5 kg (the third centile for age is 6.3 kg). He had diffuse eczema and sparse hair . His cervical and axillary lymph nodes and spleen were enlarged. Laboratory tests revealed a normal white blood cell count of 7300 ul-1， a normal hemoglobin of 11.3 g dl-1， and a normal plate-let count of 435，000 ul-1. The percentage of eosinophils in the blood was high at15%(normal<5%)， and IgE was also elevated， at 1345 IU ml-1 (normal <50IUmF). Autoantibodies were found against glutamic acid decarboxylase (the GAD65 anti-gen) and against pancreatic islet cells. Billy was started on insulin therapy， which controlled his blood glucose level.**\n\n【15】**Because of the persistent diarrhea and failure to thrive， Billy required parenteral(intravenous) nutrition to maintain his weight. An endoscopy was ordered， to ascer-tain the cause of his persistent diarrhea， and a duodenal biopsy revealed almost total villous atrophy-an absence of villi in the lining of the duodenum—with a dense infiltrate of plasma cells and T cells .**\n\n【16】**When Billy’s mother was questioned， she revealed that there had been another son， who had died in infancy with severe diarrhea and a low platelet count. On the basis of Billy's symptoms and the family history，IPEX (immune dysregulation， poly-endocrinopathy， enteropathy X-linked) was suspected. A FACS analysis of Billy's peripheral blood mononuclear cells revealed a lack of both CD4 CD25 cells and CD4Foxp3-positive cells. Sequencing of Billy’s FOXP3 gene revealed a missense muta- _tion， confirming the diagnosis._**\n\n【17】**With the diagnosis established， immunosuppressive therapy， including cyclosporin and tacrolimus， was started. Billy's diarrhea， glucose control， and eczema all improved markedly. After several months， however， his symptoms began to return and he stopped gaining weight. Shortly afterwards， he developed thrombocytopenia(a deficiency of blood platelets) and anti-platelet antibodies were detected.**\n\n【18】**The decision was made for Billy to be given a bone marrow transplant from his _5-year-old HLA-identical sister. In the weeks of conditioning leading up to the trans-_ plant， the diarrhea and eczema resolved. After transplantation， full engraftment of his sister's stem cells was established. Two weeks after transplantation，anti-plate-let， anti-GAD65， and anti-islet cell antibodies could not be detected. A year after the transplant， Billy continued to be symptom-free， although analysis for chimerism revealed that only 30% of his T cells are derived from his sister’s cells.**\n\n【19】**Fig. 18.3 Photomicrograph of duodenal biopsy from a child with IPEX.

CD4 responder cells and CD4CD25 T regulatory (suppressor) cells were mixed， together with antigen-presenting cells， at the ratios shown on the horizontal axis. The cells were stimulated with immobilized plate-bound anti-CD3and soluble anti-CD28 for 3 days， then assessed for proliferation as measured by the incorporation of 3H-labeled thymidine into DNA.**\n\n【24】**Immune dysregulation， polyendocrinopathy， enteropathy X-linked disease (IPEX).**\n\n【25】**IPEX is a very rare disease caused by mutations in the gene for the forkhead tran-scription factor Foxp3， which is essential for the function of CD4\\* CD25\\*Treg cells. Foxp3 expression is restricted to a small subset of TCRo： T cells and defines two pools of regulatory T cells： CD4\\* CD25high T cells and a minor population of CD4\\*CD25-ow/negT cells. Ectopic expression of Foxp3 in vitro and in vivo is sufficient to convert naive murine CD4T cells to Treg cells. In contrast，overexpression of FOXP3in naive human CD4\\* CD25-T cells in vitro will not generate potent suppressor activity， suggesting that additional factors are required. Foxp3 expression and sup-pressor function can， however， be induced in human CD4\\* CD25-Foxp3 cells by cross-linking of the T-cell receptor and stimulation via the co-stimulatory receptor CD28， or after antigen-specific stimulation. This suggests that de novo generation of Treg cells in the periphery may be a natural consequence of the human immune response.**\n\n【26】Treg cells are anergic in vitro. They fail to secrete IL-2 or proliferate in response to ligation of their T-cell receptors， and depend on the IL-2 generated by activated CD4T cells to survive and exert their function. An in vitro assay that measures the ability of CD4\\* CD25+ T cells to suppress CD4 T-cell proliferation is commonly used to test for Treg function . How Treg cells suppress immune responses in vivo is still unclear. There is some evidence for contact-dependent inhibition， whereas other studies suggest that regulatory T cells exert their function by secret-ing immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL-10 or TGF-B， or by directly killing their target cells in a perforin-dependent manner.\n\n【27】Several lines of evidence show that Foxp3 is crucial for the development and func-tion of CD4 CD25 Treg cells in mice. A mutation in Foxp3 is responsible for an X-linked recessive inflammatory disease in the Scurfy mutant mouse. Male mice hemizygous for the mutation succumb to a CD4 T-cell-mediated lymphoprolif-erative disease characterized by wasting and multi-organ lymphocytic infiltration. Treg cells are absent in Scurfy mice and in mice that have another spontaneous mutation in the Foxp3 gene. In addition， specific ablation of Foxp3 in T cells only is sufficient to induce the full lymphoproliferative autoimmune syndrome observed in the Foxp3-knockout mice. The Scurfy phenotype can be rescued by the intro-duction of a Foxp3 transgene or by bone-marrow reconstitution， demonstrating the causative role of Foxp3 in pathogenesis. Thus， the lack of Foxp3-expressing Treg cells alone is sufficient to break self-tolerance and induce autoimmune disease.\n\n【28】**In humans， missense or frameshift mutations and deletions in FOXP3 result in loss of function of Treg cells and uninhibited T-cell activation. As seen in Billy's case， the most common symptoms are an intractable watery diarrhea leading to failure to thrive， dermatitis， and autoimmune diabetes developing in infancy. The diarrhea is due to widespreadinflammation ofthe gut， including the colon (colitis)， that results in villous atrophy， which reduces the absorptive capacity of the intestinal lining and thus contributes to wasting. Other diseases of immune dysregulation that are seen include autoimmune thrombocytopenia， neutropenia， anemia， hepatitis， nephritis， hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism， and food allergies. Autoantibodies also accompany these autoimmune diseases. Affected patients may also suffer more frequent infections， including sepsis， meningitis， or pneumonia， although the reason for the increased susceptibility to infection is unclear. Patients generally have normal immunoglobulin levels (except for the elevated IgE)， and their ability to make specific antibody is intact.**\n\n【29】Because the survival and function of CD4\\* CD25+Treg cells depend on IL-2， which activates signaling pathways thatutilize STAT5， deficiencies of either the IL-2 recep-tor a subunit (CD25) or STAT5B are associated with impaired Treg cell function. Decreased Treg function manifests as autoimmunity， food allergies， and increased\n\n【30】**susceptibility to infections， since lL-2 is important for the expansion and function of T effector cells.STAT5B-deficient patients are of short stature， because STAT5B is required for growth hormone receptor signaling. In addition to IPEX， a number of other immunodeficiencies may affect Treg function and stability， resulting in asso-ciated autoimmune manifestations. These include， for example， Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome ， DOCK8 deficiency ， and LRBA deficiency.**\n\n【31】**Questions.**", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

She was noted to complain of the worst headache of her life shortly before she became progressively confused. Two weeks ago, she returned from jogging noting a moderate headache with nausea and photophobia. She has a history of hypertension and tobacco use. On examination, her temperature is 37.6°C (99.8°F); heart rate, 120 beats/min; respiration rate, 32 breaths/min; and blood pressure, 180/90 mmHg. She is stuporous and moaning incoherently. Her right pupil is dilated with papilledema and ipsilateral ptosis, and she vomits when a light is shone in her eyes. She has a left lower face droop and does not withdraw her left arm and leg to pain as briskly compared to the right. Her neck is rigid. Her chest examination reveals tachycardia and bibasilar crackles. During the examination, her head suddenly turns to the left, and she exhibits generalized tonic–clonic activity. STAT laboratory tests show a sodium level of 125 mEq/L. The electrocardiograph (ECG) shows broad, deeply inverted T-waves and a prolonged QT interval.\n\n【3】 What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【4】 What is the next diagnostic step?\n\n【5】 What is the next step in therapy?\n\n【6】### ANSWERS TO CASE 12: Subarachnoid Hemorrhage\n\n【7】_Summary_ : A 50-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and tobacco use presents with sudden onset of the worse headache of her life associated with confusion, vomiting, neck stiffness, and left-sided weakness. She was noted to complain of a headache 2 weeks ago. She is now hypertensive. Her neurologic examination is significant for stupor, right cranial nerve III paralysis, left-sided weakness, neck stiffness, and a seizure. Her workup is significant for hyponatremia and ECG changes.\n\n【8】• Most likely diagnosis: Subarachnoid hemorrhage\n\n【9】• Next diagnostic step: Noncontrast CT of the head\n\n【10】• Next step in therapy: Cerebral angiography\n\n【11】#### ANALYSIS\n\n【12】##### _Objectives_\n\n【13】1\\. Identify the epidemiology and risk factors for subarachnoid hemorrhage.\n\n【14】2\\. Understand the prognosis and complications of subarachnoid hemorrhage.\n\n【15】3\\. Know a diagnostic and therapeutic approach to subarachnoid hemorrhage.\n\n【16】##### _Considerations_\n\n【17】This 50-year-old woman has multiple risk factors for subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by an underlying aneurysm: (a) her age (mean age for subarachnoid hemorrhage is 50 years of age); (b) gender (slightly higher risk for females); (c) hypertension; and (d) tobacco use. The complaint of “the worst headache of my life” to describe its sudden severe onset is classic, and may or may not be associated with altered mentation and focal neurologic deficits. There is usually a history of a recent moderate headache as a result of _sentinel bleed_ , as in her case after running, and 60% of subarachnoid hemorrhages occur during physical or emotional strain, head trauma, defecation, or coitus. The clinical severity of the subarachnoid hemorrhage is graded based on the degree of stupor, nuchal rigidity, focal neurologic deficits, and elevation of intracranial pressure. This patient exhibits neurogenic pulmonary edema, one of the many systemic complications of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Her neurologic signs localize to a ruptured right posterior communicating artery aneurysm, with the bleed causing compression of the nearby ipsilateral cranial nerve III with mydriasis, ptosis, and impaired extraocular movements. Her contralateral hemiparesis and complex partial seizure with secondary generalization can result from either parenchymal extension of the hemorrhage with edema or middle cerebral artery vasospasm, all three of which are complications of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Hyponatremia is frequently seen on chemistries, correlating with an elevation of atrial natriuretic factor, cerebral salt wasting, and/or the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone. ECG changes, especially QT prolongation, T-wave inversion, and arrhythmias, are also systemic complications common to subarachnoid hemorrhage.\n\n【18】### APPROACH TO: Subarachnoid Hemorrhage\n\n【19】#### DEFINITIONS\n\n【20】SUBARACHNOID SPACE: The spongy potential space between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater. The headache and nuchal rigidity is caused by chemical inflammation of the pia and arachnoid from blood degradation products in this space.\n\n【21】SENTINEL BLEED: Intermittent aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage causing lesser headaches that precede the “worst headache” that occurs with rupture of the aneurysm.\n\n【22】VASOSPASM: Most alarming complication of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage in which irritation causes constriction of major cerebral arteries, vasospasm, lethargy, and delayed cerebral infarction. Vasospasm occurs mostly with aneurysms rather than other causes of subarachnoid hemorrhage, and peaks between 4 and 14 days. Transcranial Doppler can be used to detect a change in flow velocity in an affected middle cerebral artery.\n\n【23】ACUTE COMMUNICATING HYDROCEPHALUS: Complication that occurs because of obstruction of the subarachnoid granulations in the venous sinuses by the subarachnoid blood. CT shows enlarged lateral, third, and fourth ventricles, with clinical signs of headache, vomiting, blurry and double vision, somnolence, and syncope.\n\n【24】#### CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【25】##### _Etiologies_\n\n【26】Subarachnoid hemorrhage is the underlying cause of approximately 10% of stroke presentations and results from a number of etiologies. Ruptured saccular or berry aneurysms account for up to 80% of nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage , and portend the worst prognosis . More than three-fourths of intracerebral aneurysms arise in the anterior circulation. The most frequent sites of aneurysms are in the anterior communicating artery (up to one-third of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhages), followed by the bifurcation of the internal carotid artery with the posterior communicating artery, and the bifurcation of the internal carotid artery with the middle cerebral artery. One-fourth of patients will have more than one aneurysm, with risk for rupture increasing with size of the aneurysm. Fibromuscular dysplasia is an associated etiology in one-fourth of aneurysm patients, whereas polycystic kidney disease is related to 3% of cases. Other risk factors for aneurysms include chronic severe hypertension with diastolic blood pressure greater than 110 mmHg, liver disease, tobacco and alcohol use, vasculitides, collagen vascular disorders such as Marfan syndrome, infections (mycotic aneurysms), and oral contraception. Non-aneurysmal causes of subarachnoid hemorrhage include trauma, arteriovenous malformations, and cocaine or amphetamine abuse.\n\n【27】##### _Diagnosis and Prognosis_\n\n【28】Head CT without contrast is the most sensitive neuroimaging study for detecting subarachnoid bleeding, appearing as hyperdensity within the cerebral convexities, cisterns, and parenchyma . Intraventricular hemorrhage portends a worse prognosis and increased risk for hydrocephalus. Sensitivity of CT is greatest 24 hours after the event with 50% still detectable after 1 week. Negative head CT occurs in 10% to 15% of cases, and should be further evaluated with lumbar puncture looking for xanthochromia (yellowish discoloration of CSF) and increased red blood cells. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies are most sensitive 12 hours after onset, but can be negative in 10% to 15% of patients as well, in which case the prognosis is better. CT, MRI, or conventional angiography can be used to screen for an underlying aneurysm .\n\n【29】通用删除2(英):<u>Figure 12–1 .

Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, _16th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Publishers, 2004:2389.)_</u>\n\n【31】Up to 60% of patients die in the first 30 days after a subarachnoid hemorrhage , 10% instantly without warning. First month mortality is 40% for hospitalized patients, with worsening of mortality to 50% to 80% with rebleeding. Severity of cases and their prognoses can be graded using a variety of scales. One of the most common is the Hunt and Hess scale based upon alertness and presence of focal signs.\n\n【32】Grade I subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) patients are alert with mild headache and nuchal rigidity and have a 5% chance of deteriorating with a 3% to 5% mortality risk.\n\n【33】Grade II patients have moderate-to-severe headache and nuchal rigidity, and a 6% to 10% mortality risk.\n\n【34】Grade III is similar to Grade II but with drowsiness, confusion, and a mild focal deficit.\n\n【35】Grade IV patients have stupor and moderate-to-severe hemiparesis.\n\n【36】Grade V patients are comatose with signs of severe increased intracranial pressure, and they have the worst prognosis with 80% chance of deteriorating, 25% to 30% rebleeding rate, and 50% to 70% mortality risk. Delayed vasospasm is a potentially serious complication that occurs in up to 20% of cases.\n\n【37】##### _Treatment_\n\n【38】Grades I and II subarachnoid hemorrhage may be observed after diagnostic measures. Emergent conventional angiography is warranted if ruptured aneurysm is suspected and neurosurgical intervention is required . Repeat angiography can be necessary if the underlying etiology is obscured by vasospasm. Endovascular coiling is indicated to reduce rebleeding in low-grade cases of subarachnoid hemorrhage and has been shown to be superior to clipping. Clipping should be performed in the first 48 hours after onset or be delayed for 2 weeks to avoid the window of greatest risk for vasospasm, especially with complicated high-grade cases. The mainstay of medical management is to reduce vasospasm through _Triple H_ therapy (hypertensive hypervolemic hemodilution) to maintain cerebral perfusion, and nimodipine, a calcium channel blocker. It is also important to address other complications including metabolic derangements (hyponatremia, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion \\[SIADH\\], cerebral salt wasting), respiratory (neurogenic pulmonary edema) and cardiac (arrhythmias) complications, seizures, and hydrocephalus, which may require ventriculostomy.\n\n【39】####", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

What further assessment and investigations must be performed in the Emergency \n\n【17】Department?\n\n【18】3. Outline the key principles in treating this patient.294\n\n【19】100 Cases in Emergency Medicine and Critical Care\n\n【20】DISCUSSION\n\n【21】The history of prolonged cough with paroxysms and vomiting, and the confusion surround￾ing the patient’s immunisation status, should raise suspicion that this child may have pertus￾sis, also known as whooping cough.\n\n【22】This is a very contagious respiratory illness caused by Bordetella pertussis. Patients are most \n\n【23】contagious up to about 2 weeks after the cough begins, although antibiotics may shorten the \n\n【24】period of time of infectivity.\n\n【25】In the twentieth century, pertussis was one of the most common childhood diseases and \n\n【26】a major cause of childhood mortality. Since use of the immunisation began, incidence has \n\n【27】decreased more than 75%. However, there has recently been an increase in the number of \n\n【28】cases, which may be due to increased awareness and recognition of pertussis, greater access \n\n【29】to laboratory diagnostic tools, increased reporting of pertussis to public health departments, \n\n【30】and reduced immunity from vaccines, due to mutations of Bordetella pertussis at a genetic \n\n【31】level.\n\n【32】The DTaP (Diptheria, Tetanus and Pertussis) vaccine is recommended for infants and chil￾dren as per the UK immunisation schedule, and immunisation is now also advised for \n\n【33】pregnant women during the 27th–36th week to provide transplacental antibody cover for \n\n【34】newborns (the child still needs to have the immunisation when born).\n\n【35】The disease usually starts with coryza and a mild cough or pyrexia. After 1 to 2 weeks and \n\n【36】as the disease progresses, symptoms may include coughing paroxysms followed by a high￾pitched ‘whoop’, vomiting during or after coughing fits and tiredness or lethargy. The cough￾ing fits can go on for up to 10 weeks or more, which is why it is also called the ‘100-day cough’.\n\n【37】Infants may present with apnoea, a known complication for those less than 6 months of \n\n【38】age in particular, which is why pregnant women are encouraged to have the vaccine. Other \n\n【39】complications of pertussis include otitis media, pneumonia, seizures and encephalopathy. \n\n【40】There are also complications due to increased intra-thoracic and intra-abdominal pressure \n\n【41】due to violent and/or prolonged coughing, such as pneumothorax, umbilical and inguinal \n\n【42】hernias, rectal prolapse, subconjunctival or scleral haemorrhage and facial and truncal \n\n【43】petechiae.\n\n【44】The diagnosis can be confirmed via nasopharyngeal aspirate/per nasal swabs, or detection of \n\n【45】anti-pertussis toxin immunoglobulin G in blood or oral fluid samples. These should be taken \n\n【46】in the Emergency Department before antibiotics are administered.\n\n【47】Admission will be required for patients who are 6 months of age or younger and acutely \n\n【48】unwell, patients with significant breathing difficulties (e.g. apnoeic episodes, severe parox￾ysms or cyanosis) and patients with a significant complication (e.g. seizures or pneumonia). \n\n【49】These patients will need respiratory isolation. Frequent vomiting can lead to dehydration; \n\n【50】therefore, it is important to assess the child’s hydration status and consider admission for IV \n\n【51】fluids and antibiotics if warranted.\n\n【52】If the patient is discharged, which is usually the case, prescribe an antibiotic if the onset of \n\n【53】cough is within the previous 21 days. A macrolide antibiotic such as azithromycin or clar￾ithromycin is recommended first-line. Advise rest, adequate fluid intake and analgesia for \n\n【54】symptomatic relief. Children who have suspected or confirmed whooping cough should stay \n\n【55】off nursery or school for 5 days after starting antibiotics, or 21 days after the onset of cough \n\n【56】(whichever is sooner).295\n\n【57】Case 86: The child with prolonged cough and vomiting\n\n【58】Pertussis is a notifiable disease; the local Public Health England (PHE) centre should be \n\n【59】informed of any suspicion of infection. Certain contact groups will also require prophylactic \n\n【60】antibiotics in confirmed cases – please refer to the NICE guidelines/CDC website for further \n\n【61】guidance.\n\n【62】Key Points\n\n【63】• Pertussis is a notifiable disease. A vaccination exists for infants and pregnant \n\n【64】mothers.\n\n【65】• It presents with a prolonged cough, with paroxysms, and vomiting. It is called the \n\n【66】‘100-day cough’.\n\n【67】• Its incubation period is around 3 weeks from the onset of the cough.\n\n【68】• Treatment includes macrolide antibiotics, which shorten the period of infectivity, \n\n【69】and supportive management.http://taylorandfrancis.com297", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

This is in contrast to a subdural hematoma， which follows the convexity of the brain.\n\n【9】**CLINICAL CORRELATION**\n\n【10】Traumatic brain injury and the resulting increases in intracranial pressure (ICP) may lead to changes in a patient's level of consciousness. With EDH， as with other supra-tentorial space-occupying lesions， pressure is placed on the brain， leading to midline shift. Epidural hematoma commonly results from laceration ofthe middle meningeal artery. Should the ICP continue to increase， contralateral hemiparesis and ipsilat-eral pupil dilation (secondary to subfalcine herniation and compression of the third cranial nerve) occurs. Without intervention， this may progress to flexor and then extensor posturing， and patients may exhibit a Cushing response： hypertension， bra-dycardia， and widened pulse pressure. The mortality of EDHs can range from 5% to50% depending upon the patient's presentation (Glasgow Coma Scale)， progression， and other factors， including age， and location (eg， posterior fossa vs temporal) and size of the lesion. An excellent recovery is predicted for patients with a normal level of consciousness preoperatively， and the mortality increases for obtunded (10%) and comatose patients (20%).\n\n【11】**OBJECTIVES**\n\n【12】**1\\. Know the definition of consciousness.**\n\n【13】**2\\. Know how to evaluate consciousness.**\n\n【14】3\\. Understand the neuroanatomical relationship between increased ICP and decreased level of consciousness.\n\n【15】**DEFINITIONS**\n\n【16】CONSCIOUSNESS： Awareness of self and environment (referred to as content of consciousness)， and ease of arousal (referred to as level of consciousness).\n\n【17】**OBTUNDED： Dulled or blunted.**\n\n【18】**STUPOR： Reduced sense or sensibility.**\n\n【19】PERSISTENT VEGETATIVE STATE： Wakefulness without awareness， with intact sleep/wake cycles.\n\n【20】COMA： Unarousable， either by external stimuli or inner needs， absence of sleep/wake cycles.\n\n【21】LOCKED-IN SYNDROME： Paralysis of voluntary muscles except for ocular movements， no disturbance of awareness.\n\n【22】OCULOCEPHALIC REFLEX (DOLL'S EYE REFLEX)： Conjugate eye move-ment opposite to head movement in order to maintain forward gaze during neck rotation. Brainstem lesions lead to absent or asymmetric eye movement.\n\n【23】CALORIC REFLEX： Ice water placed in the external auditory meatus leads to a slow， ipsilateral， conjugate eye deviation.\n\n【24】OCULAR BOBBING： Conjugate， bilateral fast downward jerk followed by slow return to mid-position.\n\n【25】**DISCUSSION**\n\n【26】Consciousness involves the ability to be awake， alert， and aware. Like awareness， arousal is not an all-or-nothing concept， but rather it ranges from inattentiveness to stupor and obtundation. Consciousness is a complex process， centered around the reticular-activating system (RAS). The RAS is a portion of the rostral pons (para median tegmental zone)， continuous caudally with the spinal cord and rostrally with the subthalamus， hypothalamus， and thalamic nuclei. Consciousness depends on intact diencephalic connections with the RAS. The ascending acetylcholinergic neurons from the RAS that project to the thalamus act as an on-off switch， deter-mining if ascending information arrives at the cortex， and if descending information\n\n【27】is likewise transmitted. The acetylcholine pathways sensitize the thalamic neurons， allowing sensory input. This leads to an“awake\"state.\n\n【28】Disturbances of consciousness have multiple etiologies， including traumatic injury， metabolic disturbances， psychiatric， infarction/hemorrhage， brainstem dis-orders， neoplastic， and toxins. Coma results from bilateral damage or lesions in the cerebral hemispheres， the thalamus， the hypothalamus， and/or the RAS. As described in this case， increases in ICP can lead to tentorial herniation and com-pression of the brainstem RAS. Comas are generally caused by lesions rostral to the level of the pons.\n\n【29】The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score is a validated physical examination scor-ing system to evaluate levels of consciousness， shown to be predictive of certain outcomes following neurological injury. It is determined by three categories： Eye(E)， verbal (V)， and motor (M). Tests are scored as follows， with total scores ranging from 3 to15：\n\n【30】**Eye**\n\n【31】Opens spontaneously 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u>， opens to sound 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u>， opens to pain 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u>， does not open 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>.\n\n【32】**Verbal**\n\n【33】Responsive and appropriate 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u>， confused 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u>， unintelligible 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u>， moans at pain通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u>， silent 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>.\n\n【34】**Motor**\n\n【35】Follows commands 通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u>， localizes pain 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u>， withdraws from pain 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u>， decorticate or flexor response 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u>， decerebrate or extensor response 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u>， no movement 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>.\n\n【36】The GCS arbitrarily defines coma as a failure to open eyes in response to verbal command (E2)， performing no better than weak flexion (M4)， and uttering only unrecognizable sounds in response to pain (V2).\n\n【37】The eye examination provides important insight into the origin of the decrease in consciousness. In an insult to the bilateral hemispheres， the papillary examina-tion and oculocephalic response is normal. As was mentioned in this case， supra-tentorial mass lesions lead to secondary brainstem compression and a blown pupil on the same side as the lesion. Brainstem lesions lead to abnormal oculocephalic responses. Patients with metabolic disturbances have normal pupils. An intact pon-tine reticular formation allows the patient to blink， either spontaneously or in reac-tion to stimuli. Roving eye movements occur with intact third nerve nuclei and connection， meaning the insult is likely toxic/metabolic or bihemispheric. Seizures lead to contralateral conjugate eye deviation. Acute pontine lesions lead to ocular bobbing. Absence of the oculocephalic response indicates progression to the caloric reflex evaluation.\n\n【38】The red nucleus is important for the localization of a lesion affecting conscious-ness. Output from the red nucleus reinforces antigravity flexion of the upper extrem-ity. When this is lost， unregulated reticulospinal and vestibulospinal tract output reinforces the extension tone of the extremities. If the patient has an upper motor neuron lesion above the red nucleus， the patient will have flexor or decorticate posturing. Upon receipt of painful stimulus， the patient will have upper limb flexion\n\n【39】with pronation of the forearm， and lower limb extension with foot inversion. With lesions below the level of the red nucleus but above the level of the vestibulospinal and reticulospinal nuclei， decerebrate posturing will occur. Decerebrate posturing is the extension and pronation of the upper extremities with extension of the lower extremities. With a lesion of the medulla， the descending corticospinal tract is dis-rupted， leading to acute flaccidity.\n\n【40】CASE CORRELATES●See Cases 41-49 (cognition).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

He also notes a troubling rash on his leg that has moved slowly from his ankle to his midthigh over the past several days. The physician diagnoses Lyme disease and prescribes tetracycline. The patient recently lost his prescription benefits through his health insurance plan, so he uses an old bottle of tetracycline from his medicine cabinet at home. One week later the man presents to the emergency department with signs of dehydration and a creatinine level of 3.6, up from his baseline of 0.6.

Degraded tetracycline is associated with Fanconi syndrome, a disorder of proximal tubule function that results in severe loss of protein, glucose, and essential minerals (especially calcium and magnesium). Tetracycline’s primary degradation product is anhydro-4-epitetracycline, which is toxic and accumulates in the proximal tubules to cause Fanconi syndrome. Patients present with symptoms of polydipsia, polyuria, and dehydration due to excess loss of water and solutes in their urine.  \n\n【7】Answer A is incorrect. Acute tubular necrosis is typically associated with hypoperfusion and is not associated with either Fanconi syndrome or tetracycline.  \n\n【8】Answer B is incorrect. Glomerulonephritis is most often caused by immune complex deposition and is not associated with either Fanconi syndrome or tetracycline.  \n\n【9】Answer C is incorrect. Kidney stones, commonly caused by hypercalciuria or infection, are not associated with either Fanconi syndrome or tetracycline.  \n\n【10】Answer D is incorrect. Renal papillary necrosis, often caused by diabetes or acute pyelonephritis, is not associated with either Fanconi syndrome or tetracycline. Renal papillary necrosis can be caused by an overdose of analgesics such as aspirin, phenacetin, and acetaminophen.

Cell adhesion describes the interactions that connect cells to their extracellular surroundings and to neighboring cells. Whether discussing a tight junction that Ziplocs® two cells together or a hemidesmosome that anchors a cell to the extracellular matrix, cell adhesion involves proteins.\n\n【4】Cell adhesion molecules ( CAMs ) are proteins that directly participate in the anchoring of one cell to another or to the extracellular matrix. Integrins are cell adhesion proteins that connect a cell to the extracellular matrix. Other CAMS stabilize the connection between cells. Cadherins are an example of a class of cell adhesion proteins that mediate calcium-dependent cell–cell attachment. In the presence of calcium, the extracellular domain of a cadherin protein on the surface of one cell associates with the extracellular domain of a cadherin on the surface of an adjacent cell. The cytoplasmic domain of the cadherin protein binds to the cell’s cytoskeleton. Cell adhesion is the result of the overlap between the cadherin proteins. Binding can occur between two identical cadherins ( homophilic binding ) or between two different cadherins ( heterophilic binding ).\n\n【5】▪ Research/review the different forms of cell adhesions.\n\n【6】▪ Integrins and cadherins are both transmembrane proteins that have a single membrane–spanning domain. Create a drawing to illustrate how an integrin protein might anchor a cell to the extracellular matrix.\n\n【7】▪ Outline the path an integrin or cadherin protein would take from synthesis to the plasma membrane.\n\n【8】▪ What determines the type of cadherins present on the surface of a cell?\n\n【9】Background\n----------\n\n【10】The lining of your intestine consists of a sheet of epithelial cells held together by tight junctions and adherens junctions that form a seal that separates your bloodstream from the contents of your gut. These epithelial cells are polarized , meaning that the top (apical) end of the cell that extends into the lumen of your gut appears different from the bottom and sides (basal–lateral) portions of the cell that extends below the cell adhesion junctions and anchors the cell to the extracellular matrix. Microvilli cover the apical surface of intestinal epithelial cells forming what is known as the intestinal brush border ( IBB ). Each microvillus is supported by a bundle of actin microfilaments that cause the plasma membrane to project outward, increasing the surface area of the apical region. The structure of the microvilli is stabilized by proteins that crosslink the actin filaments that form the core of the microvillus and by proteins that connect the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane.\n\n【11】▪ Suggest a reason it would be important to create a barrier between the lumen of your gut and your blood.\n\n【12】▪ The apical domain of an intestinal epithelial cell, functions to absorb nutrients. Describe how the structure of the apical domain relates to its function.\n\n【13】▪ How does a cell “absorb” nutrients such as glucose?\n\n【14】▪ Conduct a search for images of the structure of the actin cytoskeleton in a microvillus.\n\n【15】▪ Predict how the loss of microvilli from the surface of the intestinal epithelium would affect a person’s health.\n\n【16】Methods\n-------\n\n【17】### Cell culture\n\n【18】CACO-2 <sub>BEE </sub> cells were cultured at 37°C and 5% CO <sub>2 </sub> in tissue culture media supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum. CACO-2 <sub>BEE </sub> cell lines were created by transfecting the cells with constructs that either targeted PCDH24 mRNA for destruction by RNA interference (PCDH24-KD) or that expressed variants of PCDH24. PCDH24-KD cells were transfected with knockdown-insensitive constructs, PCDH24–EGFP or ∆EC1–PCDH24–EGFP, to assess the ability of these constructs to rescue PCDH24 function.\n\n【19】For the treatment of CACO-2 <sub>BEE </sub> cells with the calcium chelator BAPTA, cells were washed with buffer and then incubated in the presence of 1 mM BAPTA for 2 min. Cells were then immediately fixed for electron microscopy. For proteinase-K treatment, CACO-2 <sub>BEE </sub> cells were grown on filters, washed once with buffer, and incubated in buffer containing 25 U/mL of proteinase-K for 5 min. The sample was washed twice with buffer and then fixed for examination by scanning electron microscopy. Glycosidase treatment followed the same protocol with the exception that 100 μL of a protein deglycosylation mixture was added to the cells followed by incubation for 4 h.\n\n【20】### Microscopy\n\n【21】Cells and tissue sections were imaged using a laser-scanning confocal microscope, transmission electron microscopy, or a scanning electron microscope. Cells were washed with buffer then fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde. For immunofluorescence, cells were washed after fixation with buffer and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100, washed, and incubated with antibodies to F-actin or PCDH24 for 2 h at 37°C. The cells were washed again and then reacted with fluorescent secondary antibody. For scanning electron microscopy, the fixed tissue or cells were rinsed with buffer and then imaged without further processing using an environmental scanning electron microscope.\n\n【22】Mouse intestine was removed by dissection, fixed, and processed for scanning electron microscopy or freeze-etch electron microscopy. Tissue was fixed with 4% glutaraldehyde, washed with water, and then rapidly frozen by contact with the surface of a sapphire block cooled to −186°C with liquid N <sub>2 </sub> . Samples were etched by raising the temperature of the sample to −100°C for 8–15 min. Replicas were generated by platinum rotary shadowing and viewed using a transmission electron microscope.\n\n【23】### Analysis of microvillar clustering\n\n【24】Cells from a 12-day postconfluency (12DPC) monolayer were stained for F-actin and PCDH24. Individual cells were scored according to whether they exhibited robust microvillar clustering (possessing one or more distinct clusters of five or more microvilli) or nonclustering microvilli. Cells were then scored for PCDH24 expression levels (negative, low, or high).\n\n【25】### Bead aggregation assay\n\n【26】The extracellular adhesion domains of PCDH24, ∆EC1–PCDH24–-EGFP, MLPCDH-S, MLPCDH-L, or E-cadherin, were expressed as fusion proteins with an Fc domain, which promotes binding to the surface of fluorescent protein A-coated beads. Fusion proteins were incubated with the beads for 1 h with gentle agitation at 4°C. The beads were washed extensively in buffer and then either incubated on their own or mixed with beads carrying a different fusion protein. Beads were allowed to aggregate for 1 h in a glass depression slide in a humidified chamber and images were collected every 15 min. For aggregation assays in the absence of calcium, the beads were washed in buffer supplemented with 2 mM EGTA. Assays were performed at least three times using three independent transfections.\n\n【27】▪ Conduct a search to learn more about CACO-2 <sub>BEE </sub> cells.\n\n【28】▪ Research/review how RNA interference functions to knock down expression of a specific protein.\n\n【29】▪ Explain how an RNAi knockdown cell can be “rescued.”\n\n【30】▪ Compare the methods used for scanning electron microscopy and freeze etch electron microscopy.\n\n【31】▪ Predict what the results of a bead aggregation assay would look like if:\n\n【32】▪ The proteins on the surface of the bead form homophilic interactions.\n\n【33】▪ The proteins on the surface of the bead form heterophilic interactions.\n\n【34】▪ The proteins on the surface of the bead do not participate in adhesion.\n\n【35】Results\n-------\n\n【36】▪ Describe how the microvilli of CACO-2 <sub>BEE </sub> cells develop over time with reference to their length and organization .\n\n【37】▪ Characterize the pattern of attachment that you observe in the 20-days postconfluency (20DPC) CACO-2 <sub>BEE </sub> monolayer.

TIA is a brief neurologic episode， typically less than 1 hour in duration that does not cause infarction. The occurrence of stroke after TIA is as high as 5.3% within 2 days and 10.5% within 90 days. Warfarin is indicated in specific circumstances， such as the presence of atrial fibrillation， but is not routinely used following a TIA.\n\n【29】**44.2 C. IV labetalol should be started to achieve appropriate blood pressure con-trol. Routine chest x-rays affect the clinical management in few patients with stroke， and are not recommended as routine initial workup. CT of the brain without contrast can exclude most cases of intracranial hemorrhage， tumors， or abscesses， and is the initial test of choice in the workup of suspected stroke but it can miss up to 15% of subarachnoid hemorrhages. When a subarach-noid hemorrhage is suspected but not seen on CT， a lumbar puncture is indi-cated for diagnosis.**\n\n【30】**44.33 D. Early mobilization of stroke patients should be started when they are con-sidered medically stable. In the setting of an acute stroke， management of high blood pressure should be cautious. Thrombolytic therapy can be benefi-cial in selected patients， but carries significant risks and has numerous con-traindications. Fever should be treated and a workup performed to determine its etiology， as it carries an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. At this point， 4 hours after symptoms， when the patient is speaking without diffi-culty， a swallowing evaluation is not immediately warranted.**\n\n【31】**44.4 C. Patients with stroke but no detected sources of embolism benefit from antiplatelet agents not anticoagulants.Aspirin， clopidogrel， or a combination of aspirin and dipyridamole are acceptable regimens. For patients with recent TIA or ischemic stroke and ipsilateral severe (>70%) carotid artery steno-sis， carotid endarterectomy is recommended. When the degree of stenosis is less than 50%， there is no indication for CEA. Patients with a history of symptomatic cerebrovascular disease should be treated with high-intensity statin therapy.**\n\n【32】44.55A. The patient has severe hypoglycemia and needs to be treated immediately with intravenous glucose or glucagon. If the patient does not recover with glucose or glucagon infusion， then other tests， such as a CT scan， may be warranted. Be aware that hypoglycemia can mimic many of the symptoms of a stroke， including focal weakness. Mannitol is used in cases of cerebral edema and not for raising blood sugar.

The rash has been present for about 20 years and has expanded progressively from initially involving his lower back and buttock to spreading to his legs and upper back. Previous biopsies have been performed, which showed a possible contact dermatitis. He was also treated with numerous antifungal shampoos and creams, but showed no improvement. On examination, there are numerous eczematous erythematous patches and plaques on the back, chest, arms and legs, involving approximately 75% of the patient’s total body surface area ( 57a , b ).\n\n【4】i. This patient’s disease most likely falls within what group of conditions?\n\n【5】ii. What are the histopathologic findings of this disease, and what additional testing can lead to a specific diagnosis?\n\n【6】iii. What are the treatment options?\n\n【7】Answer 57\n\n【8】i. This patient has cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), which describes a group of neoplasms of skin-homing T cells. CTCL accounts for 75%–80% of all primary cutaneous lymphomas, whereas primary B-cell lymphomas account for 20%–25%. There are several types of CTCLs that have been defined based on clinical, histological and immunophenotypical criteria. These entities can vary considerably in both their clinical presentation and disease course.\n\n【9】The clinical presentation of this patient is consistent with classical mycosis fungoides (MF). The course is often indolent, extending over years. Many patients experience several years of nonspecific eczematous and psoriasiform skin findings and non-diagnostic skin biopsies. The median time from the development of skin lesions to the diagnosis of mycosis fungoides is 4–6 years. In the classical type, the early patch stage is characterized by variably-sized, erythematous, hyperpigmented patches that often involve the buttocks and other covered sites of the trunk and limbs. Progression can lead to infiltrated red-brown plaques (plaque stage MF) and in some patients, nodules and tumours (tumour stage MF).\n\n【10】There are other clinical variants of MF, including folliculotropic MF, hypopigmented MF, pagetoid reticulosis (also known as Woringer–Kolopp disease) and granulomatous slack skin, among others.\n\n【11】ii. Histologically, MF is characterized by a lymphocytic lichenoid infiltrate containing atypical cells with small- to medium-sized cerebriform nuclei confined to the epidermis. In early patch stage lesions, the epidermotropism may be subtle, becoming more pronounced in the plaque stage of MF. Intraepidermal nests of atypical cells, known as Pautrier’s microabscesses are characteristic features of MF but are only observed in a minority of cases. With progression to the tumour stage, dermal infiltrates are more evident and may extend down to the subcutaneous tissue.\n\n【12】Immunophenotyping can occasionally provide additional information. The neoplastic cells of MF have a CD8-memory T-cell phenotype, which is positive for CD3 and CD4. However, aberrant phenotypes are typically observed in plaque or tumour stage MF and rarely assist in the diagnosis of early patch stage MF.\n\n【13】iii. The therapeutic approach to MF is dependent on both the stage of the disease and the age and condition of the patient. Skin-directed therapies are preferred in early stages of MF (IA–IIA) or limited tumour stage MF (IIB). These include topical or intralesional corticosteroids, topical chemotherapy (mechlorethamine, carmustine), radiotherapy or phototherapy. Systemic therapy is considered in patients with refractory or progressive skin disease. Some agents that are used in combination are oral retinoids (isotretinoin, etretinate, acitretin, bexarotene), interferon alpha, denileukin diftitox and histone deacetylase inhibitors such as vorinostat and depsipeptide. Systemic treatment is usually a multi-agent chemotherapy, and the most common regimen used is cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunomycin, vincristine and prednisone. This is reserved only for patients with lymph node or visceral involvement or in patients with progressive skin tumours recalcitrant to prior treatments.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

It arises from the epithelium located between the sebaceous gland and the arrector pili muscle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Pilar cyst is lined by stratified squamous epithelium without a granular cell layer and is filled with keratin. It is most commonly observed in young women. Family history may be present since the disease follows autosomal dominant inheritance in some cases. Clinically, pilar cyst presents as a flesh-colored, smooth, movable, firm, and well-circumscribed nodule. In case of long duration, hair loss on the skin surface immediately above the cyst may be presented. Most commonly, they are multiple lesions, but sometimes, single lesion might be presented. Pilar cyst usually occurs in areas with dense hair follicle especially the scalp, but they may also be found on the face, head, and neck. It is usually asymptomatic. Calcification or eruption lead to inflammatory process and cause pain in the affected area. Diagnosis of pilar cysts is mainly based on the clinical picture. Radiological studies sometimes are needed to exclude other differentials and determine the extent of the lesion. A histopathological examination is characterized by the presence of epithelial lined cyst filled with brightly eosinophilic keratinaceous debris. In case of focal rupture of the cyst, giant cell reaction may be presented. The treatment is a radical surgical excision of the lesion including the wall of the cysts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】Pilar cyst should be differentiated from furuncle, lipoma and skin metastasis.\n\n【29】Furuncle is a common bacterial infection of the hair follicle with purulent extension into the adjacent subcutaneous tissue leading to abscess formation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The most common infectious agent is _Staphylococcus aureus_ , but other bacteria may also be causative. Furuncle presents as a red, swollen, and tender nodule. Fever and enlarged lymph nodes are rarely observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Furuncle may occur on any hair-bearing area. However, it most frequently appears on the extremities. The lesion may lead to scarring upon healing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】Lipoma is the most common subcutaneous soft-tissue tumor composed of adipocytes. It presents as a solitary, slow-growing nodule with a firm, rubbery consistency. Lipomas are usually asymptomatic. The lesions typically occur on the trunk, shoulders, posterior neck, and axillae 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】Scalp involvement is observed in 4% to 7% of patients with skin metastases. Clinically, they present as a single or multiple non-tender nodules which are characterized by rapid growth. Disfigurement, pain, bleeding, and drainage may occur. The lesions may develop a long-time after the initial diagnosis or be the first sign of an internal malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【32】In the presented patient based on the clinical manifestation the initial diagnosis of pilar cyst was established.

A chest X-ray demonstrates multifocal pneumonia and she is started on broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin and piperacillin–tazobactam. During her hospitalization, she develops a bullous eruption on the trunk and dermatology is consulted. On examination, there are many tense vesicles and bullae on an erythematous base filled with serous fluid, some arranged in an arcuate pattern ( 76a ).\n\n【4】i. Based on this patient’s history and clinical presentation, what is the diagnosis and what test should be used to confirm your suspicion?\n\n【5】ii. What is the treatment for this condition?\n\n【6】Answer 76\n\n【7】i. The patient has linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD), an immune-mediated bullous disorder characterized by subepidermal blisters and linear deposition of IgA along the basement membrane zone seen on direct immunofluorescence ( 76b ). To confirm the diagnosis, a skin biopsy should be completed and sent for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain as well as direct immunofluorescence. In adults, LABD is commonly drug induced. One of the most common culprit medications is vancomycin. Other drugs that have been identified in association with LABD are penicillins, cephalosporins, captopril and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). LABD can also be idiopathic or seen in association with other disease processes including gastrointestinal disorders such as gluten-sensitive enteropathy and ulcerative colitis, infections and malignancies. There is a childhood form, known as chronic bullous disease of childhood, which is identical histologically to LABD but has a unique clinical presentation and has been associated with Crohn’s disease but not medications or malignancy.\n\n【8】Clinically, LABD presents as subepidermal bullae arranged in a herpetiform or annular pattern. There are often clusters of smaller vesicles that are described as a ‘crown of jewels’ and new blisters tend to arise in a ring around older lesions, known as the ‘string of beads’ sign. In adults, the bullae often first present on the extremities and over time can progress to other sites. In children, the bullae classically involve the genital region initially but can spread to involve the face, lower trunk, hands and feet. Mucous membrane involvement is observed in up to 50% of patients.\n\n【9】ii. In patients with drug-induced LABD, the first step is to remove the offending agent. Most patients with LABD will respond further to oral dapsone therapy within 2–3 days. It is important to check the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) level and adjust the dose accordingly. Sulfapyridine has also been used in place of dapsone. Oral prednisone up to 40 mg daily can also be used as an adjunctive treatment for disease control. Children usually respond to dapsone at a dose of 1–2 mg/kg daily.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

On January 27th, 2020, the patient developed an aversion to cold, fever, and general malaise after catching a cold. After taking some medicine for colds (medicine detail was unknown) for 3 days, her symptoms had not resolved significantly, and she still had a fever, the maximal body temperature being 38.8°C. On February 3rd, the patient presented to the Hospital of Hubei Province. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed the following: bilateral pulmonary multiple ground-glass opacities, considering the infectious lesions of bilateral pulmonary, and there was the possibility of viral pneumonia. On February 4th, the patient presented to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, and was diagnosed with “COVID-19” because nucleic acid detection for the SARS-CoV-2 was positive. Then, the patient was transferred to Wuhan No. 3 Hospital for clinical observation, where she received 0.25 g of azithromycin once a day for 3 days. However, the patient’s clinical symptoms had not resolved significantly, her fever persisted and was accompanied by chest distress and shortness of breath; therefore, she was transferred to this hospital for further diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【11】Since the onset of the patient’s illness, she suffered from listlessness, poor appetite, fatigue, somnolence, and significant weight loss. At that time, the patient reported that she had a fever, chest distress and shortness of breath, which aggravated while moving, tachypnea, dry cough, listlessness, fatigue, poor appetite, bitter taste in the mouth, normal urination and defecation, and she was groaning in pain. About the previous history, the patient reported that she had a history of intermittent vasovagal syncope for 5 years. The patient reported that she had no history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market and no history of family members with pneumonia recently. There were no known drug allergies.\n\n【12】### Patient’s Condition on Admission\n\n【13】On admission, the patient had a high fever, wheezing, shortness of breath, dry cough, bitter taste in the mouth, nausea, poor appetite, fatigue, somnolence, and normal urination and defecation. The patient’s tongue color was darker, the tongue coating was white and greasy, with slight yellowness , and her pulse was slippery, rapid, and weak.\n\n【14】The physical examination revealed a body temperature of 39°C, heart rate of 100 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, blood pressure of 136/88 mmHg, and peripheral oxygen saturation of 90% while the patient was breathing ambient air; the peripheral oxygen saturation could be increased to 96% with the administration of oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 3 liters per minute.\n\n【15】Figure 2-4-1. Tongue manifestation on admission.\n\n【16】### Admission Diagnosis\n\n【17】COVID-19 (severe type).\n\n【18】### Treatment Plan\n\n【19】On admission, the patient had a high fever, wheezing, shortness of breath, inability of moving, poor appetite, nausea, normal urination and defecation, and she was groaning in pain. The peripheral oxygen saturation was 90%. Laboratory results on February 7th were as follows: the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 69 mm per hour, the white blood cell count was 6.91 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> per liter, the neutrophil percentage was 82.1%, the absolute value of lymphocyte was 1.03 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> per liter, the C-reactive protein was greater than 160 mg per liter, and the serum ferritin was 622.91 ng per milliliter.

Chest CT showed bilateral multiple pulmonary lobes and segment areas of patchy ground-glass opacities .\n\n【20】### Western Medicine Treatment Strategies\n\n【21】通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Given that the patient was in the epidemic area of Wuhan, the patient’s symptoms (fever, wheezing, shortness of breath, and cough) were the main clinical symptoms of COVID-19 and the patient’s auxiliary examination results (nucleic acid test was positive, and chest CT showed bilateral pulmonary multiple patchy ground-glass opacities) were consistent with the characteristics of viral pneumonia; therefore, the diagnosis of COVID-19 was clear and definite.\n\n【22】通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> According to the oxygen saturation of 90% while the patient was in a resting state, the patient’s condition was assessed as severe type.\n\n【23】通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> The patient was groaning and suffered from fever, dyspnea, poor appetite, low energy, low albumin, weight loss, and a weakened state since the onset of the illness. The patient received oxygen therapy, and her neutrophil was elevated. Given the possibility of co-infection with the bacterial infection, on February 7th, treatment was given with 3 g of cefoperazone-sulbactam twice a day, 15 g of human immunoglobulin once a day, and 10 g of human serum albumin once a day for low albumin. On February 10th, the patient’s wheezing and shortness of breath were obvious, aggravated while moving, and her energy was not good. Meanwhile, the peripheral oxygen saturation was 92% while the patient was breathing ambient air, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 80 mm per hour, the serum ferritin was 1955.40 ng per milliliter, the absolute value of lymphocyte was 0.77 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> per liter, and levels of inflammatory indexes were all elevated. The patient received short-term treatment with glucocorticoids (methylprednisolone was administered intravenously from 60 mg decreased to 20 mg), after which her symptoms were relieved, and gradually the amount of medication was reduced and discontinued.\n\n【24】Figure 2-4-2.

And, her tongue color was darker, the tongue coating was white and greasy, with slight yellowness, and her pulse was slippery and weak. There was a sign of deficiency of healthy Qi. Although the patient was influenced by plague Qi. She was to be treated by removing toxicity, clearing lung-heat, and eliminating evil Qi, which is the main therapeutic method. However “The strong person who damaged by cold-evil should be treated through inducing diaphoresis, and the weak person who damaged by cold-evil should be treated through strengthening the spleen and stomach.” The patient ate little for many days, the spleen and stomach were weak and decayed, and the pulse was slippery and weak. Due to the fear of obstruction-removing therapy, evil Qi could not be eliminated, but healthy Qi was trapped, finally leading to the inward invasion of evil Qi. Therefore, treatment with modified Liu Jun Zi Tang was initiated, to strengthen her spleen and stomach, replenish Qi to invigorate the spleen, resolve dampness, and harmonize Middle Jiao; we then waited for the healthy Qi to recover, due to the so-called saying, “If you have stomach Qi, you will live, if you have no stomach Qi, you will die”. As for the prescription, Dang Shen ( _Codonopsis Radix_ ), Bai Zhu ( _Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma_ ), Fu Ling ( _Poria_ ), and Gan Cao ( _Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma_ ) can make up Si Jun Zi Tang, which can replenish Qi, invigorate the spleen, and resolve dampness. We added Fa Ban Xia ( _Pinelliae Rhizoma Praeparatum_ ) and Chen Pi ( _Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium_ ) to Si Jun Zi Tang; this is Liu Jun Zi Tang. It increased the power of resolving phlegm and drying dampness. Furthermore, we increased the dose of Zhi Huang Qi ( _Astragali Radix Praeparata Cum Melle_ ) to replenish the spleen Qi and lung Qi with sweet-warm. We used Guang Huo Xiang ( _Pogostemonis Herba_ ) to repel foulness and resolve dampness with aroma (a therapeutic method of using aromatics to treat dampness pattern/syndrome, and to remove filthy turbidity), and Sha Ren ( _Amomi Fructus_ ) to regulate Qi-flowing, warm the spleen and stomach, and resolve dampness. Meanwhile, a small amount of Huang Lian ( _Coptidis Rhizoma_ ) as a supplement was able to clear heat and remove toxicity, dry dampness, and prevent various herbs from warming and drying up. The formula was as follows:\n\n【29】Fa Ban Xia ( _Pinelliae Rhizoma Praeparatum_ ) 9 g, Chen Pi ( _Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium_ ) 10 g, Fu Ling ( _Poria_ ) 15 g, Dang Shen ( _Codonopsis Radix_ ) 15 g, Chao Bai Zhu ( _Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma_ ) ( _baked_ ) 10 g, Guang Huo Xiang ( _Pogostemonis Herba_ ) 10 g, Sha Ren ( _Amomi Fructus_ ) 6 g, Zhi Huang Qi ( _Astragali Radix Praeparata Cum Melle_ ) 30 g, Gan Cao ( _Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma_ ) 6 g, Huang Lian ( _Coptidis Rhizoma_ ) 3 g.\n\n【30】It was given in 3 doses, granules, 1 dose per day, to be taken in the morning and evening.\n\n【31】At the same time, the patient received 50 milliliters of Xue Bi Jing injection at a frequency of once a day for cooling blood, activating blood, removing toxicity, and inhibiting “cytokine storm”.\n\n【32】#### _02/10/2020_\n\n【33】The patient’s body temperature gradually recovered to normal ranges, and she reported improved appetite, worsening wheezing and shortness of breath, tachypnea after slightly moving, anxiety and terror, along with slight cough, little sputum, fullness and discomfort in chest and hypochondrium, bitter taste in the mouth, dry mouth, insomnia, and normal urination and defecation. The patient’s tongue color was dull-red, the tongue coating was yellow, thick, and greasy , and her pulse was string-like, slippery, and rapid. The peripheral oxygen saturation was 92%. Dry throat, bitter taste in the mouth, and fullness and discomfort in chest and hypochondrium are some symptoms in the Shao Yang stage; wheezing, tachypnea, dyspnea, and yellow greasy coated tongue are all clinical features resulting from dampness-heat and plague toxin accumulated in San Jiao, Mo Yuan (membrane source), blocking the lungs. So, we chose Xiao Chai Hu Tang and Hao Qin Qing Dan Tang as a fundamental prescription, took out Ren Shen ( _Ginseng Radix et Rhizoma_ ), Sheng Jiang ( _Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens_ ), and Da Zao ( _Jujubae Fructus_ ) because they could make dampness and fire develop rapidly. The purpose of adding Guang Huo Xiang ( _Pogostemonis Herba_ ) was to resolve dampness and harmonize Middle Jiao with aroma, adding Yi Yi Ren ( _Coicis Semen_ ) was to clear heat and drain dampness, and adding Chi Shao ( _Paeoniae Radix Rubra_ ) was to cool blood and activate blood, and cut off the path of evil Qi into the blood, just like “settling a place free from evil Qi”. This pre-scription focuses on clearing heat and resolving dampness, separating elimination from upper and lower (a therapeutic method of using the herb to open the upper, diffuse the middle, and drain the lower for treating the condition in which the San Jiao’s Qi movement is obstructed by warmheat and phlegm-dampness), and has the power of harmonizing and releasing the Shao Yang and regulating the San Jiao. The formula was as follows:\n\n【34】Figure 2-4-3. Tongue manifestation on February 10th.\n\n【35】Chai Hu ( _Bupleuri Radix_ ) 15 g, Huang Qin ( _Scutellariae Radix_ ) 10 g, Jiang Ban Xia ( _Pinelliae Rhizoma Praeparatum cum Zingibere et Alumina_ ) 10 g, Fu Ling ( _Poria_ ) 20 g, Zhi Qiao ( _Aurantii Fructus_ )10 g, Zhu Ru ( _Bambusae Caulis in Taenias_ ) 15 g, Qing Hao ( _Artemisiae Annuae Herba_ ) 15 g, Hua Shi ( _Talci Pulvis_ ) 20 g, Chen Pi ( _Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium_ ) 10 g, Zhi Gan Cao ( _Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma Praeparata Cum Melle_ ) 6 g, Yi Yi Ren ( _Coicis Semen_ ) 30 g, Huo Xiang ( _Pogostemonis Herba_ ) 10 g, Chi Shao ( _Paeoniae Radix Rubra_ ) 10 g, Ku Xing Ren ( _Armeniacae Semen Amarum_ ) 10 g.\n\n【36】It was given in 5 doses, granules, 1 dose per day, to be taken in the morning and evening.\n\n【37】#### _02/15/2020_\n\n【38】Most symptoms of the patient improved significantly: chest distress and dyspnea after moving improved significantly, wheezing and shortness of breath were alleviated, and the patient could get up and walk. But, she still had a slight cough, bitter taste in the mouth, and poor appetite; sleep, urination, and defecation were all normal. The tongue color was pale and darker, the tongue coating was yellow and greasy , and the pulse was string-like and slippery. The peripheral oxygen saturation was 95% while the patient was breathing ambient air, the absolute value of lymphocyte was 2.26 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> per liter, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 55 mm per hour, the serum amyloid A was 79.0 mg per liter, and the C-reactive protein was 10.4 mg per liter. Re-examination of chest CT showed that infectious lesions on both the lungs were absorbed . Treatment with 3 doses of the previous prescription was continued.\n\n【39】Figure 2-4-4. Tongue manifestation on February 15th.\n\n【40】Figure 2-4-5. Chest CT images on February 14th.\n\n【41】_Note_ : Bilateral multiple pulmonary lobes and segment areas of ground-glass opacities.\n\n【42】#### _02/18/2020_\n\n【43】The patient’s energy was improved; wheezing and shortness of breath were alleviated obviously. The patient could get up and walk, and her symptoms of slight cough, poor appetite, and bitter taste in the mouth persisted; she slept well, and had normal urination and defecation. The tongue color was pale and darker, the tongue coating was white thin and greasy , and the pulse was string-like and slippery. The peripheral oxygen saturation was 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air, the absolute value of lymphocyte was 2.03 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> per liter, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 22 mm per hour, the serum ferritin was 473.33 ng per milliliter, and the hypersensitive C-reactive protein was 2.1 mg per liter. Most of the dampness-heat and plague toxin were cleared away, so we took out Qing Hao ( _Artemisiae Annuae Herba_ ), Hua Shi ( _Talci Pulvis_ ), and Huo Xiang ( _Pogostemonis Herba_ ) from the previous prescription, used Dang Shen ( _Codonopsis Radix_ ) to replenish Qi to invigorate the spleen. The formula was as follows:\n\n【44】Chai Hu ( _Bupleuri Radix_ ) 15 g, Huang Qin ( _Scutellariae Radix_ ) 10 g, Jiang Ban Xia ( _Pinelliae Rhizoma Praeparatum Cum Zingibere et Alumina_ ) 10 g, Fu Ling ( _Poria_ ) 20 g, Zhi Qiao ( _Aurantii Fructus_ ) 10 g, Zhu Ru ( _Bambusae Caulis in Taenias_ ) 15 g, Chen Pi ( _citri reticulatae pericarpium_ ) 10 g, Zhi Gan Cao ( _Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma Praeparata Cum Melle_ ) 6 g, Yi Yi Ren ( _Coicis Semen_ ) 30 g, Chi Shao ( _Paeoniae Radix Rubra_ ) 10 g, Dang Shen ( _Codonopsis Radix_ ) 10 g.\n\n【45】Figure 2-4-6. Tongue manifestation on February 18th.\n\n【46】It was given in 5 doses, granules, 1 dose per day, to be taken in the morning and evening.\n\n【47】#### _02/22/2020_\n\n【48】All the symptoms were alleviated, the patient could move with ease, and there was no cough, wheezing, and dyspnea. Diet, sleep, urination, and defecation were normal. The tongue color was pale and darker, the tongue coating was white thin and slimy , and the pulse was slippery. The peripheral oxygen saturation was 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air, chest CT showed that it had improved compared to earlier , and two nucleic acid detection tests for SARS-CoV-2 were negative; the patient was discharged from the hospital. The patient continued to receive 7 doses of the previous prescription to solidify (granules, 1 dose per day, to be taken in the morning and evening).\n\n【49】Figure 2-4-7.

Changes of chest CT\n\n【69】Chest CT scanned on February 22 compared to that scanned on February 7 showed ground-glass opacities absorbed significantly, indicating a significant absorption of inflammation .\n\n【70】### Patient’s Condition at Discharge\n\n【71】After admission, the patient’s body temperature returned to normal, wheezing was relieved, and the peripheral oxygen saturation was 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Two nucleic acid detection tests were negative, inflammation indexes returned to normal, and chest CT indicated a significant absorption of inflammation. The patient’s condition improved obviously, and she was discharged from the hospital on February 22nd. After discharge, she continued to take the last prescription for 12 doses. Later, through telephone follow-up, we were told that the patient had recovered.\n\n【72】### Case Analysis\n\n【73】通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> The plague also belongs to the category of generalized exogenous diseases, and the treatment method includes strengthening healthy Qi and eliminating evil Qi. _Huang Di Nei Jing_ ( _The Yellow Emperor’s Classic of Internal Medicine_ ) recorded that “A doctor who is good at diagnosis attaches importance to check the color of the body and analyze the pulse, distinguish Yin and Yang at first.” In this case, first, Liu Jun Zi Tang was given to support Middle Jiao; when the healthy Qi came back, there was a struggle between the healthy Qi and evil Qi, and the patient exhibited wheezing and shortness of breath, fullness and discomfort in chest and hypochondrium; therefore, we put Xiao Chai Hu Tang and Hao Qin Qing Dan Tang into use, to clear heat and drain dampness, separate elimination from upper and lower, regulate San Jiao, and recover pivot. The patient’s symptoms significantly improved after taking 5 doses of traditional Chinese medicine herbal tea.\n\n【74】通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> COVID-19 belongs to the category of “dampness toxin plague” of traditional Chinese medicine, and the “dampness” is an important feature of this COVID-19 epidemic. In the early stage of the disease, the trapping of dampness is essential; the patient manifests fever, fatigue, body aches, dry cough, poor appetite, and a white greasy tongue coating. However, dampness hurts the person, and it can hurt Yang Qi because of cold transformation, or it can transform into dampness-heat because of heat transformation; it can also hurt Yin because of dryness transformation. In clinic practice, we can commonly see that the dampness toxin and plague Qi enter the body, then transform into heat, intertwine with each other, lie in the lungs, Mo Yuan (membrane source), and San Jiao. The clinical manifestations are as follows: chest distress and shortness of breath, which aggravated after moving, recurring fever, poor appetite, bitter taste in the mouth, palpitation, insomnia, fatigue, and a thick and greasy tongue coating. This is the critical period of treatment; if we fail to control the disease, the disease will turn into the severe stage, the healthy Qi will collapse, and the plague toxin will invade inward; then it can turn into phlegm, block the lungs, confuse the heart, and lead to respiratory failure; or it can enter the blood and cause blood stasis; it can also be trapped in the heart, liver, spleen, and kidney, causing multiple organ failure. Doctor Tianshi Ye’s book named _Wen Re Lun_ ( _Treatise on Epidemic Febrile Diseases_ ) recorded that “Evil Qi stays in San Jiao, it’s just like Shao Yang disease in exogenous cold disease, Shao Yang disease in exogenous cold disease should be treated with harmonizing and releasing the exterior and interior, and this should be treated with separating elimination from upper and lower, we should change the method according to the change of the syndrome, Ku Xing Ren ( _Armeniacae Semen Amarum_ ), Hou Po ( _Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex_ ), Fu Ling ( _Poria_ ), and so on are common herbs, Wen Dan Tang is also the effective prescription.” Therefore, the method of harmonizing pivot and regulating San Jiao is important, and Chai Qin Wen Dan Tang is appropriate, which is composed of Xiao Chai Hu Tang and Hao Qin Qing Dan Tang. Hao Qin Qing Dan Tang comes from Genchu Yu’s _Chong Ding Tong Su Shang Han Lun_ ( _Revisiting Popular Treatise on Cold Pathogenic Diseases_ ); it is used for treating Shao Yang dampness-heat phlegm syndrome. During the development of dampness-heat and plague toxin, the dampness is trapped and the heat is stagnated, which blocks the Shao Yang gallbladder and the San Jiao. The Qi movement of San Jiao was depressed, the upward, downward, inward, and outward movements of Qi are blocked, and the ministerial fire is fierce, so that the pivot is inhibited. In terms of the treatment, Doctor Yu thought that the gallbladder and the San Jiao were equally important; one is to harmonize and release the exterior and interior, and clear the dampness-heat of Gallbladder Meridian, and the other is to separate elimination from upper and lower, and get rid of the evil Qi of San Jiao. This is the development and application of doctor Tianshi Ye’s method of separating elimination from upper to lower.\n\n【75】通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> Through treatment, the patient’s condition improved rapidly, the peripheral oxygen saturation was elevated, the inflammation indexes returned to normal, and the plague toxin and evil Qi were significantly reduced. Therefore, we removed Qing Hao ( _Artemisiae Annuae Herba_ ), Hua Shi ( _Talci Pulvis_ ), and Guang Huo Xiang ( _Pogostemonis Herba_ ), and added Dang Shen ( _Codonopsis Radix_ ) to invigorate the spleen and replenish Qi, support Middle Jiao, and strengthen healthy Qi to eliminate evil Qi.\n\n【76】(Bin Li, Xiaodong Cong, Qing Miao, Yiling Fan)", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines， men with high-risk sexual behaviors should be screened at least annually or more frequently for HIV，gonorrhea， chlamydia， and syphilis， and treated if they have a positive result. There are no data to support empiri-cally treating for all STIs (answer A). This patient has a history of not using barrier contraception； thus， encouraging abstinence (answer D) and condom use (answer B) are insufficient. There are data to support starting individu-als with high-risk sexual practices on PrEP (tenofovir and emtricitabine)**\n\n【25】**to avoid infection with HIV (answer E)； however， this will not reduce the patient's transmission of other STIs at this time.**\n\n【26】**45.2 B. A four-fold change in titer， equivalent to a change of two dilutions (eg， from 1：16 to 1：4 or from 1：8 to 1：32) is considered necessary to demonstrate a clinically significant difference between two nontreponemal test results obtained using the same serologic test. This patient’s titer has dropped more than four-fold and thus can be considered successfully treated. Therefore， repeat treatment with penicillin is not necessary (answers A and C). Fail-ure of nontreponemal test titers to decline four-fold within 6 to 12 months after therapy for primary or secondary syphilis might be indicative of treat-ment failure (per the CDC guideline). Doxycycline (answer D) should only be used in a patient who has a true allergy to penicillin and cannot undergo desensitization.**\n\n【27】**45.3 A. Lumbar puncture to exclude neurosyphilis is generally indicated when any patient with syphilis develops neurologic or ocular symptoms； it is also con-sidered if HIV-infected patients with syphilis have a CD4 count less than350 cells/mm’or an RPR titer exceeding 1：32. Skin biopsy (answer B) is not the way to diagnose syphilis； rather， diagnostic procedures include serology or， if very early， scraping with dark-field analysis. MRI and EEG (answer C) are not indicated in an asymptomatic patient and would not diagnose CNS syphilis. Skin testing for penicillin allergy (answer D) is not indicated unless the patient had a history of severe allergic reactions. Adjustment of HIV medications prior to penicillin (answer E) is not indicated， and once the stage of syphilis is ascertained， treatment should be started.**\n\n【28】**45.4 D. Approximately one-third of patients who have the primary lesion of the chancre will have negative serology. They will require either dark-field micros-copy or biopsy with special stains to identify the spirochetes； the organism is too thin to be visualized by conventional light microscopy. Empiric treat-ment with penicillin is reasonable if dark-field microscopy is not available. Chancroid (answer C) is much less likely due to the epidemiologic consider-ations， and usually this condition is painful. Genital herpes (answer B) and chancroid should produce painful genital ulcers， and Chlamydia (answer A) should cause nonulcerative cervicitis or urethritis. Biopsy for vulvar cancer(answer E) is indicated for an older patient or a persistent ulcer， but it is not indicated in this patient.**\n\n【29】Syphilitic chancres are generally clean， painless， ulcerative lesions that resolve in 2 to 6 weeks if untreated； the eruption of a maculopapular rash on the palms and soles signifies secondary syphilis.\n\n【30】Elevated RPR and VDRL tests are nonspecific and may be falsely positive in several normal conditions (pregnancy) and disease states (systemic lupus erythematosus).\n\n【31】Specific treponemal antibody tests， such as the MHA-TP and the FTA-ABS test， should be performed for confirmation of a syphilis diagnosis， but once positive， they usually stay positive for life.\n\n【32】The reverse testing algorithm has advantages over traditional testing in that T. pallidum antibodies 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> are specific to syphilis， 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> are more sensi-tive than VDRL testing or RPR titer for detecting both primary and late syphilis， 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> can be tested using automated instruments， and 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> can pro-vide a more rapid time to result.

Infants and toddlers have no trouble with these competencies. The process of socialization can either preserve the child’s awareness of her desires, while teaching how to delay, find substitutes, and make plans, or severely compromise the ability to distinguish what is truly desired from what pleases others. People who live according to rules and decisions they made when they were young may be out of touch with what will make them happy.\n\n【4】#### Awareness of Alternatives\n\n【5】Choice exists as long as there is more than one alternative; if a person is not aware of alternatives, there is no freedom. Wheelis 通用删除7(英):<u>(1975)</u> describes an ant who is suffering in a concrete parking lot. If it knew that a certain car was about to drive to the country, it could jump on its wheel and soon be enjoying a wonderful picnic in a grassy paradise. However, without awareness of that alternative, the ant has no freedom to choose. One of the primary goals of therapy is to help clients discover and evaluate alternatives.\n\n【6】#### Capacity to Postpone Action\n\n【7】If a person lacks the capacity to postpone an action, the choice cannot be considered free, even if he or she feels subjectively free at the time. Rather than freely chosen, the action is considered impulsive. In using terms like _delay of gratification_ and _frustration tolerance_ , we address an individual’s capacity to forego current pleasure and to endure unpleasant emotions, in order to achieve desired goals.\n\n【8】#### Ability to Contemplate Consequences\n\n【9】To choose wisely among alternatives, it is necessary to be able to imagine the probable and the possible consequences of each alternative. The ability to access memories to make valid future predictions comes with the maturation of the brain, and through life experience.\n\n【10】#### Skills and Resources\n\n【11】We need not only awareness and courage, but also specific skills and resources. Imagine someone who has been given a large plot of land but who lacks tools, seeds, and water. How free is he to be a farmer? It is frustrating for people to have others preach that they should use their freedom when they are highly motivated to achieve their goals, but need help in acquiring information, skills, and other resources.\n\n【12】### Responsibility\n\n【13】It is not enough for us to mobilize a sense of freedom in clients: We need to help them use their freedom in ways that make positive changes in their lives, without causing harm to others. Freedom and responsibility go hand and hand. You are free to do whatever you want, but you are responsible for the consequences of everything that you do.\n\n【14】To determine who is responsible for an action, we need to examine duties and responsibilities that are embedded in cultural mores, as well as the voluntary agreements of partners in relationships. In some situations, a person is responsible for the consequences of another person’s behavior: If one is a member of a criminal conspiracy, he is punishable for the crime that was physically committed by a fellow conspirator. Sometimes no one is responsible for a harmful outcome because it was not under human control—when a car accident is caused by weather or a well-maintained airplane develops a malfunction. There are many circumstances under which people are not held fully responsible for acts they commit: when they cannot control impulses because of brain damage, are unable to distinguish between right and wrong because of severe mental retardation, or are coerced by someone else who held them at gunpoint.\n\n【15】Here, as with freedom, there are two types of errors:\n\n【16】1.  Denying responsibility for one’s own choices: When the consequences of an action were foreseeable, to a reasonable person, and steps could have been taken to prevent harm, then you are responsible. Guilt is an appropriate emotion when one’s behaviors have caused harm to others, and many clients seek to avoid guilt by avoiding responsibility. (The topic of moral responsibility is addressed in the Spiritual Dimension \\[ES3\\] hypothesis.) Blaming others, such as parents, past lovers, and coworkers, or claiming incompetence or powerlessness are convenient tactics to evade responsibility. Symptoms and disorders can be described as entities that visit us and take over control, rather than as expressions of our own free choice: “I have depression” is a way of disavowing that I depress myself.\n2.  Assuming responsibility for what was not a consequence of choice: When the consequences of an action could not have reasonably been predicted, it is unreasonable to assign responsibility; it is fair to use terms like _accident_ or _misadventure_ . In these circumstances, guilt and self-blame are inappropriate, and suffering caused by those emotions is self-imposed. Often in relationships a partner is blamed for not meeting an obligation that he or she was unaware of, never accepted, and therefore was not responsible for.\n\n【17】The term _victim_ is appropriately used when someone suffers from events or actions for which he or she does not bear responsibility. There are two errors in applying the concept of victim: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> blaming yourself when you actually _are_ an innocent victim, as when you are a victim of rape; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> presenting yourself to others in the role of victim when you bear responsibility for choices that contributed to your suffering or for failure to make choices to reduce your suffering. Victimhood, like responsibility, is not all or nothing. When a person is victimized while under the influence of alcohol, the decision to imbibe alcohol and put himself in a risky situation falls in the domain of his responsibility; the responsibility of the perpetrator, however, is not diminished by the victim’s alcohol-induced impairments.\n\n【18】### Commitment\n\n【19】When you make a commitment, you freely decide to limit your own freedom. You turn your back on available possibilities. The capacity to make a major life commitment comes with knowledge of your own needs, talents, limitations, and values; experimentation with different temporary paths; and a realistic, appraisal of what life has to offer. You agree to accept minor negative consequences because they are outweighed by the benefits that come from choosing a certain path. However, if, at a future time, you discover that prolonged pain and misery have replaced the benefits you anticipated, you are free to make new choices. Making a commitment sets limits on freedom but does not destroy it.\n\n【20】Clients bring problems at two extremes: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> the inability to make and keep a commitment (often labeled “irresponsibility” by others), and 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> the inability to terminate an old commitment based on an updated cost-benefit analysis. People who avoid commitment sometimes fit the Jungian archetype of _puer aeturnus_ ( _puella_ for women), meaning “eternal youth.” They hold on to these attitudes: “I want it all—I want to have my cake and eat it too; I want to keep all my options open.” Sometimes they have fears that have never been concretely identified, so it is important to ask questions like, _What are the consequences that you are afraid of? What will you be losing?_ and _How will your life be 10 years from now if you never make this kind of commitment?_\n\n【21】People who easily and frequently break commitments often have unrealistic expectations, imagining that life can be free of problems, stress, and negative emotions or that another person can be free of flaws, perfectly attentive and devoted, and never grow older, fatter, or less sexually desirable. There are also many signs of childlike thinking in people who refuse to quit something that has not yielded success: “If I want it enough, it’s got to work out.” “I’ve got to show _them_ that I’m not a quitter.” “If I fail at this, I’m worthless and I’ll never be happy.” “I am afraid that without this I have nothing.” There needs to be a middle road between never making a commitment because your desires seem to change constantly and making a commitment that is so set in concrete that you sacrifice future freedom.\n\n【22】### When Is This Hypothesis a Good Match?\n\n【23】The Freedom and Responsibility hypothesis provides a useful lens for understanding a wide variety of clients. Many therapists use it without ever articulating the philosophical bases of freedom and responsibility as they guide their clients through a process of identifying their wants, evaluating their current behavior, clarifying alternatives, making choices, mustering their will, creating plans, and engaging in productive action. Here are some examples of client data that support the relevance of the Freedom and Responsibility hypothesis:\n\n【24】Self-Imposed Limitations (Avoidance of Freedom)\n\n【25】*   Client believes that past misfortunes, such as inadequate parenting, permanently limit her possibilities for a happy future.\n*   Client is overly conforming and rule-ridden, talking in terms of “shoulds” and “can’ts” and doing exactly what her parents expected, despite being unhappy with some of these choices.\n\n【26】Failure to Recognize Real-World Limits\n\n【27】*   Client describes grandiose fantasies for future projects without any realistic sense of the skills, resources, and self-discipline required to achieve these goals.\n*   Client persists in pursuing a relationship with a person who has clearly chosen another partner.\n\n【28】Lack of Self-Control and Self-Discipline\n\n【29】*   Client states desired goal (complete college degree), but then claims “I can’t help it” for engaging in self-defeating behavior (e.g. partying instead of studying).\n*   Client expects good things to come to him without needing to expend effort.\n\n【30】Avoidance of Responsibility\n\n【31】*   Client reports guilt and shame over past behavior but does not take any action to make amends or to refrain from similar action in the present.\n*   Client refuses to accept obligations in life, insisting on doing whatever she wants, regardless of the consequences.\n\n【32】Table 12.2 lists problem areas of clients who would benefit from application of this hypothesis.\n\n【33】Table 12.2 Sample Problems for Freedom and Responsibility (ES2) Hypothesis\n\n| Struggling with making a choice/commitment | Indecision about a job offer.Ambivalence over whether to make a marital commitment.Dilemma over choice of educational paths.Uncertainty over choosing timing of retirement. |\n| --- | --- |\n| “Stuck” in an unhappy situation | Victim of spousal abuse.Dissatisfaction with “boring” job.Feels incapable of living as an independent adult separate from parents.Difficulty setting realistic goals and developing constructive plans for future. |\n| Frustration with inability to behave in accordance with intentions (lack of self-control) | Difficulty adhering to health-promoting strategy (weight loss, smoking cessation, abstinence from drugs or alcohol).Excessive angry outbursts at children followed by guilt.Starts new sexual relationship despite intention to experience a period of celibacy.Inability to maintain desired amount of controlled drinking. |\n| Engaging in behavior that brings negative consequences for self or others | Engages in unprotected sex with multiple partners.Difficulty maintaining employment.At risk for flunking out of college because of poor grades.Exercises poor judgment in choice of partners. |\n| Emotional distress related to guilt, anxiety, or lack of confidence | Anxiety over making major decisions.Inability to overcome guilt for past mistake.Excessive fear over taking risks and trying new experiences. |\n| Parental challenges in raising children capable of self-directed action | Difficulty tolerating healthy autonomy of toddler.Difficulty adopting a parenting style with adolescents that promotes responsible choices.Interferes with child’s spontaneous play and exploration. |", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

ADPKD has a prevalence of approximately1：1，000 and is the leading genetic cause of chronic renal failure. It is diagnosed with imaging.\n\n【4】**How is this condition inherited?**\n\n【5】The disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Approximately 85% of cases of ADPKD are due to a mutation in the PKD1 gene on chromosome 16； the remainder of the cases are caused by mutations in PKD2 on chromosome 4.\n\n【6】**What is the presentation of this condition?**\n\n【7】ADPKD may present at any age but is most frequently diagnosed in the third to fifth decades (although PKD type 2 inheritance has a later onset). Because ADPKD is dominantly inherited， patients may be aware of a family history of the disease. Patients can experience chronic flank pain due to calculi， urinary tract infection， or massively enlarged kidneys. Patients may also present with gross hematuria， and nocturia may be present if renal concentrating ability is impaired. Upon presentation， microscopic hematuria and proteinuria may be found， and hypertension at presentation is common.\n\n【8】**What are the extrarenal manifestations of this condition?**\n\n【9】Colonic diverticular disease is the most common extrarenal effect of ADPKD. Hepatic cysts  are present in 50%-70% of patients and are generally asymptomatic with little effect on liver function. There is also an association between ADPKD and berry aneurysms of the circle of Willis， which show familial clustering. Rupture of such aneurysms results in subarachnoid hemorrhage and increased mortality and morbidity. Mitral valve prolapse is found in 25% of patients with this disease. Most patients with APDKD die from cardiac causes. Cardiac hypertrophy and coronary disease are extremely common.\n\n【10】**FIGURE 12-1. Bilateral kidney cysts in polycystic kidney disease.

There is great variability in the progression of the disease even within families. Early age at diagnosis， male gender， recurrent infection， proteinuria， and hypertension are all associated with an early onset of renal failure. PKD1 carriers tend to have a more severe course. At present， there is no proven treatment for ADPKD； management generally consists of controlling any associated hypertension and/or proteinuria to preserve the glomerular filtration rate， but renal replacement therapy is eventually indicated.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The patient's neurological status is also categorized using the Glasgow coma scale 通用删除1(英):<u>(please see Table 29-1)</u>.No premedication is indicated given the patient's depressed level of con-sciousness. Monitoring includes standard monitors (5-lead ECG， pulse oxime-try， capnography， noninvasive blood pressure monitoring)， urine output， body temperature， and train-of-fourACUTE SUBDURAL HEMATOMA (ACUTE SDH)： Is usually caused by tear-ing of the bridging veins that drain from the surface of the brain to the dural sinuses. Rupture of these vessels allows for bleeding into the space between the arachnoid membranes and dura. Venous bleeding is usually arrested by the rising intracranial pressure or direct compression by the clot itself. lrauma to the cortical arteries accounts for approximately 20% to 30% of SDH cases.\n\n【11】GLASGOW COMA SCALE： Quantifies neurological impairment in the setting of head injury in terms of eye opening， speech， and motor function. The maxi-mum score that can be obtained is 15， and severe head injury is determined by a score of 8 or less persisting for 6 hours or more. The numerical points assigned to patients in the Glasgow coma scale are illustrated in Table 29-1. An indi-cation for ICP monitoring is an acute SDH with GCS score less than 9.CEREBRAL AUTOREGULATION： Is a protective mechanism that maintains cerebral blood flow between mean arterial pressures (MAP) of 50 and 150 mm Hg by adjusting cerebral vascular resistance. Hypertensive patients demon-strate a shift of autoregulation to a higher blood pressure. Thus， their lower level of autoregulation could be well above 50 mm Hg， and their upper limit of autoregulation similarly increased.A SDH is considered acute if the patient becomes symptomatic within 72 hours of an insult or injury， subacute between 3 and 15 days， and chronic after 2 weeks. The neurological findings associated with an acute SDH may include an altered level of consciousness， a dilated or nonreactive pupil ipsilateral to the hematoma， and/or hemiparesis contralateral to the hematoma. An acute SDH typically requires a craniotomy for evacuation of the clot and decompression of the brain， while burr holes can be used to achieve the same for chronic SDH. Both subacute and chronic SDHs are usually observed in patients over 50 years of age.\n\n【12】Head trauma is the most common cause of SDH， with the majority of cases resulting from motor vehicle accidents， falls， and assaults. Patients with signifi-cant cerebral atrophy are particularly at risk. This category includes the elderly， those with a history of chronic alcohol abuse， and those with previous traumatic brain injury. In such patients， trivial head trauma or even whiplash injury in the absence of physical impact may produce a SDH. Similarly， the use of antithrom-botic agents also increases the risk of SDH. In one series， treatment with oral anticoagulants， aspirin， or heparin at the time of hemorrhage was present in21%， 13%， and 5% of patients with chronic SDH following head trauma.\n\n【13】The estimated mortality rate for patients requiring surgery for SDH is 40%to 60%. In patients who present with coma， the mortality rate approaches the higher end of that range. Age and neurological status as assessed with the Glasgow coma scale are also important prognostic indicators for patients with SDH.1\\.

If the GCS starts at <9 and deteriorates by 2 points or more**c. ICP >20 mm of Hg**One of the major concerns is the maintenance or reduction of ICP， particu-larly in the preoperative period and during induction. The volume inside the cra-nium is fixed， so if any of the components located in the cranial vault increase in volume， others must decrease or the ICP will increase. When the cranium is open， ICP equals atmospheric pressure， and cerebral perfusion pressure thus equals MAP. Cerebral perfusion pressure should be maintained at a minimum or60 and 100 mm Hg systolic to prevent secondary ischemic damage.\n\n【16】The specific effects of individual drugs on cerebral vasomotor tone and cerebral metabolic rate are summarized in Table 29-2. Ensuring an adequate depth of anesthesia， controlling blood pressure to avoid hypertensive crises， maintaining cerebralperfusion， and striving for a physiological ICP are more important than the choice of any particular anesthetic drug.\n\nThe changes in CBF caused by anesthetic drugs reflect the drug's individ-ual effects on cerebral vasomotor tone and metabolic rate. In the normal brain， a reduction in cerebral metabolic rate causes cerebral vasoconstriction and reduces CBF， counteracting the vasodilatory effect of the drug. Cerebral vasomotor tone and metabolic rate can be affected to a diffterent extent at different concentrations. Consequently， despite the direct cerebral vasodilatory effects of volatile anesthetics， CBF remains relatively unchanged at concen-trations of up to 1 MAC.In the presence of an elevated ICP， thiopental is most commonly used to induce anesthesia， if the patient can tolerate the hypotension that may result. Alternative agents such as propofol or etomidate are also acceptable. In addi-tion， lidocaine is often administered intravenously 90 seconds prior to intu-bation to suppress laryngeal reflexes， and esmolol may be used to reduce heart rate and blood pressure in response to laryngoscopy.A popular maintenance regimen for neurosurgical patients is a continuous infusion of propofol with remifentanil or fentanyl. In a hemodynamically sta-ble patient with severe intracranial hypertension， narcotics in conjunction with a thiopental infusion (2-3 mg/kg/h) and a nondepolarizing muscle relax-ant are sometimes administered with oxygen and air. However， the sedative effects of barbiturates or benzodiazepines can cause postoperative sedation， and thus impede a patient's ability to cooperate with a neurological examina-tion. In patients with less severe intracranial hypertension， anesthesia is typ-ically maintained with various combinations of barbiturates， narcotics， and sub-MAC concentrations of a volatile anesthetic.Increasing arterial carbon dioxide levels cause vasodilation and an increase in cerebral blood flow. As a good rule of thumb， increasing the carbon dioxide tension from 40 to 80 mm Hg doubles cerebral blood flow； reducing the car-bon dioxide from 40 to 20 mm Hg halves it. These changes are transient， and cerebral blood flow returns to normal within 6 to 8 hours even if the altered carbon dioxide levels are maintained. After induction of anesthesia， in the presence of a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) care must be taken to main-tain a normal Paco，. If a reduction in ICP is desired， only transient and mod-erate hyperventilation should be considered.The patient should be normovolemic， and serum osmolality normal or slightly elevated to minimize cerebral edema. Hypovolemia is associated with cerebral1ischemia andperioperative neurological deficits， especially in patients with cerebral vasospasm. Dextrose containing solutions should be avoided because glucose administration increased the incidence of neurologic deficits in experimental models. Infusing large volumes of hypo-osmolar crys-talloid solutions such as lactated Ringer solution may predispose to brain edema and contribute to hyponatremia. Therefore， the use of normal saline is preferable.Blood loss during surgery requires transfusion of cross-matched or fresh whole blood. A minimum hematocrit between 30% and 33% is recommended to maximize oxygen transport.One significant challenge is the patient's response to the large foreign body in his trachea， namely the endotracheal tube.“Bucking”or coughing on the endotracheal tube can cause arterial hypertension and elevated ICP Precautions to avoid coughing， straining， hypercarbia， and large swings in blood pressure include lidocaine administered before extubation， beta blockers to control blood pressure， and other antihypertensives if needed during emer-gence. The patient’s head should be elevated by 15 to 30 degrees， but with con-sideration to the fact that this position increases the likelihood of aspiration.Following the removal of an intracranial hematoma， the control of ICP is of paramount importance in the patient's recovery. It is common practice to monitor ICP in the postoperative period in these patients， since those with ICPs below 20 to 25 mm Hg tend to have significantly better outcomes than patients with elevated ICP. Various techniques are used to measure ICP including ventricular catheters， subdural and subarachnoid bolts， epidural transducers， and intraparenchymal fiberoptic devices.

Although somewhat artificial this is also true of scenarios in the theory examination， the only difference being that not all the parameters will be given to you. In any case it will be necessary to identify all the salient points from the case history to enable you to answer the question.**\n\n【20】**Amaya's symptoms of tachypnoea and tachycardia are temporally related to her taking a dose of penicillin. The blanching red rash and widespread wheeze support a diagnosis of a type 1 IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction to the penicillin which has led to urticaria and bronchospasm. Although it would not be futile to suggest nebulised salbutamol as the answer this can only be considered an adjunct as ultimately she requires a dose of intramuscular adrenaline 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u>. In this situation adrenaline has wide ranging actions including stimulation of； (i) alpha adrenoceptors which increases peripheral vascular resistance， reverses peripheral vasodilatation and reduction in angioedema； (ii) beta 1 adrenoceptors which have positive inotropic and chronotropic cardiac effects； and (iii) beta 2 adrenoceptors which causes bronchodilatation and reduces inflammatory mediator release. Although intravenous adrenaline can be used in difficult cases of anaphylaxis its use is restricted to intensive care settings 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u>.**\n\n【21】**Barney's case revises the management of the pulseless child. Algorithms are regularly updated by the Resuscitation Council UK (RCUK) and candidates are advised to revise their knowledge of all acute algorithms. In this situation， we have a child on the non-shockable side to the APLS algorithm with the management of asystole requiring effective chest compressions (with bag mask ventilation) until intravenous (or intraosseous) access is obtained to allow the administration of adrenaline. The right-hand side to figure (20.1) concerns the \"shockable” rhythms， namely ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia. Children with these rhythms require DC cardioversion as well as effective cardiopulmonary resuscitation.**\n\n【22】**Chris' case is rather complex， though the above principles still apply. The fact that he has a history of self-harm would suggest that he has a history of risk taking behaviour and has ingested the white powder he is in possession of that has caused his current state. This ingestion has caused him to be unconscious， develop a tachyarrhythmia， hypertension and an elevated temperature. These features are in keeping with acute cocaine overdose whose management is largely symptomatic. Of primary concern are its deleterious effects on the cardiovascular system secondary to a hyperadrenergic state. After oxygenation this is managed with escalating doses of benzodiazepine. The hyperpyrexia in this situation is driven by the increased stimulation and activity of muscle causing heat production， together with vasoconstriction inhibiting heat loss.**\n\n【23】**Anaphylaxis from penicillin can be fatal and must be treated seriously. The possibility of a biphasic reaction means that children with a good response to initial treatment for suspected anaphylaxis should be observed for 6-12 hours. Blood samples for mast cell tryptase testing aids in determining if the event was indeed an anaphylactic reaction. Samples should be taken as soon as possible without delaying emergency treatment， one to two hours after the onset of symptoms and at least 24 hours later 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u>.**\n\n【24】**After emergency treatment for suspected anaphylaxis reaction a referral to a specialist allergy service should be made. A referral is NOT required for penicillin allergy. The specialist will ensure that the reaction was indeed anaphylaxis， provide education and also identify alternatives should they need antibiotics in future. Epinephrine injectors are not required as penicillin is easily avoided， as opposed to the inadvertent exposure of food allergens.**\n\n【25】**_Figure 20.1： Advanced Paediatric Life Support Algorithm (Adapted from Resuscitation Council (UK)_**\n\n【26】**_通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u>).

How do you_ _explain this?_\n\n【5】**Answers**: **Answer 1**\n\n【6】**Mycobacteria， particularly atypical mycobacteria， are ubiquitous in the environment， and any infection is normally contained by T-cell action. AIDS， however， is character-ized by a marked reduction in the number of CD4 THl cells. Hence the production of IFN-y is compromised， and patients with AIDS have difficulty in activating their macrophages and clearing mycobacteria.**\n\n【7】**Answer 2**\n\n【8】The delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction is provoked by a few T cells that are spe-cific for tuberculin. After binding antigen， these T cells secrete chemokines that non-specifically recruit macrophages and other inflammatory cells. The secretion and action ofthese chemokines are not dependent on IFN-Y. It is therefore not surprising that Clarissa and her cousins developed positive tuberculin skin tests.\n\n【9】**Answer 3**\n\n【10】**Granulomas form where there is local persistence of antigen， antigen-specific T cells， and activated macrophages. These children could not activate their macrophages， so it is not surprising that they did not form granulomas. Granulomas can be benefi-cial in that they wall off and prevent the spread of microorganisms. These children could not do that and we find the mycobacteria spreading via the bloodstream一a highly unusual finding in mycobacterial disease. However， granuloma formation is preserved in patients with autosomal recessive partial IFN-YRl deficiency and in patients with IL-12Rβl deficiency.**\n\n【11】**Answer 4**\n\n【12】**Infection with pyogenic bacteria such as pneumococci is controlled and termi-nated by antibody and complement. In fact Clarissa had a very high level of IgG(1750 mg dl-)， probably as a result of increased IL-6 production induced by the chronic mycobacterial infection. Most viral infections， such as chickenpox， are ter-minated by cytotoxic CD8 cells. Activation of these cells is not dependent on IFN-Y. However， there is evidence from mice that a lack of the IFN-y receptor increases sus-ceptibility to certain viruses， including vaccinia virus and lymphocytic choriomenin-gitis virus. Salmonellae take up residence as an intracellular infectionofmacrophages and become inaccessible to antibody and complement； they can be destroyed in this site only when macrophages are activated by IFN-Y.**", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

He has mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome .\n\n【11】Preoperative Evaluation\n-----------------------\n\n【12】Questions\n\n【13】1.  1.\n\n【14】    What would you like to know about him _before_ he comes to the operating room for his anesthetic and diagnostic tests? What problems do you anticipate?\n\n【15】2.  2.\n\n【16】    How will you “design” your anesthetic technique?\n\n【17】Answers\n\n【18】1.  1.\n\n【19】    Symptoms of MELAS syndrome usually begin between the ages of 2 and 15 years, but delayed onset cases have also been reported between 15 and 40 years and late onset cases after 40 years. In approximately 75% of cases, onset of the disorder is before the age of 20 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. At 8 years of age, it is likely that much is known about this patient qualitatively but not quantitatively. It should be anticipated that he might have some cardiac functional abnormalities like cardiac myopathy as well as cardiac conduction abnormalities like varying degrees of heart block. It would not be surprising if he had some degree of respiratory insufficiency on a chronic basis; therefore, a careful history should be solicited for airway obstruction, sleep apnea, and breath-holding episodes. The likely chronic nature of these problems, if present, should foster a high index of suspicion for pulmonary hypertension, which can be confirmed by the echo study. Sensorineural hearing loss has also been reported in MELAS patients; for this reason, the BAEP is included in the EUA. Patients may undergo successful cochlear implant surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Visual problems such as ophthalmoplegia, acute and intermittent vision loss with exacerbations, and retinal changes occur.\n\n【20】    The underlying defect of accumulating lactic acid can lead to vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, muscle weakness, and difficulty breathing. This accumulation of lactic acid has also been noted in the spinal fluid and in the brain. In some cases, affected individuals will experience a slow deterioration of intellectual function (dementia) and/or a diminished ability to communicate by speech, writing, and/or signs (aphasia). Individuals with MELAS syndrome may also have episodes of confusion and hallucinations often due to a preceding fever (febrile illness) and/or headache. Less common symptoms include involuntary muscle spasms (myoclonus), impaired muscle coordination (ataxia), cardiomyopathy, diabetes mellitus, depression, bipolar disorder, gastrointestinal problems, and kidney problems 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】    Depending on his degree of impairment, it may be possible to evaluate some of these manifestations prior to his anesthetic, such as biochemical profile (electrolyte derangement, degree of lactic acidosis, hepatic function, scalar ECG if possible for conduction defects) and overall level of function, because of the pleiomorphic nature of the disease onset and spectrum. Laboratory investigations of glucose and lactate levels, electrolytes, liver enzymes, and creatine kinase are specifically performed perioperatively. Assessment of the degree of musculoskeletal and neurological impairment including respiratory and swallowing functions should be made. Measurement of forearm muscle oxygenation responses during and following arterial occlusion provides an easily performed screening test that detects impaired oxygen use. During and following arterial occlusion, which can be performed by a tourniquet, deoxy\\[Hb+Mb\\] and oxy\\[Hb+Mb\\] are registered. Patients with mitochondrial myopathy display altered oxygenation responses during and following arterial occlusion which might help to evaluate the patient’s individual impairment. Lung function evaluation (spirometry, MIPs, MEPs) and blood gas analysis help to evaluate pulmonary function. A 12-lead electrocardiograph should be performed to exclude pre-excitation syndromes and conduction defects (especially Wolff-Parkinson-White).\n\n【22】2.  2.\n\n【23】    Similar to many other metabolic disorders, prolonged fasting will tend to make MELAS patients worse, so the NPO time should be minimized or supplemental glucose provided. Lactated Ringer’s is not the best IV fluid to use because of the baseline lactic acid elevation. The use of succinylcholine is controversial because of the risk of hyperkalemia , but exaggerated responses to nondepolarizing muscle relaxants have been reported. Acid-base status must be followed closely. Five percent of patients have diabetes. Various anesthetic techniques have been reported, but it is important to keep in mind that most anesthetic drugs depress mitochondrial function. Perioperative hyponatremia and hyperkalemia have been noted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. Finally, patients with mitochondrial disorders often suffer from general muscle weakness that restricts cardiopulmonary capacity. Due to impaired energy supply, peripheral nerves are at risk of positional damage.\n\n【24】Intraoperative Course\n---------------------\n\n【25】Questions\n\n【26】1.  1.\n\n【27】    How will you monitor this patient? Only noninvasive monitoring? Arterial line? Why or why not?\n\n【28】2.  2.\n\n【29】    Does this patient need an additional line for biochemical monitoring ?\n\n【30】3.  3.\n\n【31】    What is your choice for IV fluid? Lactated Ringer’s? Normal saline? Glucose-containing fluid or nonglucose fluid?\n\n【32】4.  4.\n\n【33】    What are your metrics of providing a stress-free anesthetic for this case? Why is it important?\n\n【34】5.  5.\n\n【35】    How will you ensure normothermia ? What temperature range would you be willing to tolerate? Why?\n\n【36】6.  6.\n\n【37】    What is your antiemetic strategy ? Would that be rational if the patient had QT prolongation? How much?\n\n【38】Answers\n\n【39】1.  1.\n\n【40】    Inasmuch as these are mainly diagnostic procedures with very little tissue trauma, surgically related stress will be minimal, but the amount of time to accomplish all of these coordinated services will be significant, on the order of several hours. That being the case, routine noninvasive monitoring should be accompanied by biochemical monitoring for lactic acidosis , adequacy of glucose levels, and overall acid-base status. This can be accomplished with a second IV of sufficient size to permit blood withdrawals for venous blood gases. If there is any significant concern based on clinical deterioration and unreliability of venous blood gases, then an arterial line should be placed for frequent metabolic monitoring.\n\n【41】2.  2.\n\n【42】    One IV would be sufficient if an arterial line will be placed anyway; otherwise, two IVs would be my plan.\n\n【43】3.  3.\n\n【44】    Glucose-containing fluid should be utilized; at least D51/2NS would be reasonable or D5NS. I would avoid D5LR solution for the above reasons.\n\n【45】4.  4.\n\n【46】    Other than the muscle biopsy, there is not likely to be a lot of stress associated with these procedures. A well-controlled general anesthetic can be delivered with many choices of agents—volatile agents, a combination of narcotic and muscle relaxant (carefully monitored because of the possibility of unmasking underlying muscle weakness), or a combination of both. Total intravenous anesthesia with continuous infusion propofol has been reported, but controversy remains about this choice for children with mitochondrial disorders and adverse effects on the electron transport chain and possible association, even with short-term exposure, with propofol-infusion syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【47】5.  5.\n\n【48】    MELAS is not associated with malignant hyperthermia, and I would direct attention to maintaining normothermia in order to optimize enzyme system function.\n\n【49】6.  6.\n\n【50】    Antagonists of serotonin and dopamine can affect the QT interval and for this reason should be given carefully to patients with known QT prolongation. Often patients with minimal QT prolongation may receive these medications with continuous monitoring, as in the operating room, and demonstrate no ill effects. Steroids are also commonly used as an antiemetic, but may have deleterious, increased metabolic effects that increase lactic acidosis. The risks and benefits must be weighed.\n\n【51】Postoperative Course\n--------------------\n\n【52】Questions\n\n【53】1.  1.\n\n【54】    Post-emergence delirium\n\n【55】2.  2.\n\n【56】    Shivering\n\n【57】3.  3.\n\n【58】    Weakness\n\n【59】Answers\n\n【60】1.  1.\n\n【61】    Since organ systems with inherently higher metabolic rates tend to be affected more in MELAS syndrome, it would not be surprising that in response to a stressful event, the accompanying encephalopathy along with alterations in vision and hearing may be affected, worsening the susceptibility to post-emergence delirium.\n\n【62】2.  2.\n\n【63】    Tight control of body temperature is important; autonomic regulation including temperature is often impaired in mitochondrial disease. Postoperative shivering increases energy requirements and therefore should be controlled by keeping the patient normothermic (important in the PACU as well). All fluids should be warmed to body temperature. Meperidine in small doses may be used for its beneficial antishivering effects.\n\n【64】3.  3.\n\n【65】    Because patients with MELAS have a high risk of respiratory failure and aspiration due to muscle weakness, care must be taken to dose muscle relaxants very cautiously and monitor their effect. I would avoid succinylcholine because of the risk of hyperkalemia in deconditioned patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Segregation of the inside of an organelle from the rest of the cytoplasm allows for specialization of organelle function.\n\n【4】Purified phospholipid molecules will spontaneously adopt a bilayer structure when placed in an aqueous solution, forming spherical “bubbles” or liposomes. However, organelle membranes, like other biological membranes, are more than just phospholipids. Biological membranes are characterized as fluid mosaics, consisting of a phospholipid bilayer with integral and peripheral membrane proteins . While some cellular organelles can be described as spheres, others are decidedly not. The endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) is an example of an organelle that forms a complicated, tubular network that can fill the cytoplasm of a cell. If phospholipid bilayers form spheres, then how does the ER form tubules?\n\n【5】▪ Create a list of the membrane-bound organelles you would expect to find in a eukaryotic cell.\n\n【6】▪ Describe how the unique function of each of the organelles on your list is helped by the presence of a distinct compartment separated from the rest of the cell.\n\n【7】▪ Explain why phospholipids form bilayers and liposomes.\n\n【8】▪ Illustrate the concept of the fluid mosaic model of a biological membrane. Label your drawing.\n\n【9】Background\n----------\n\n【10】The ER is an extensive tubular network of membranes, emerging from the outer membrane of the nuclear envelope, creating a large surface area and enclosing an equally extensive lumenal compartment. There are two forms of ER: the rough ER ( RER ) and the smooth ER ( SER ). Although the two types of ER have different functions, they are in fact continuous, with lipids and proteins diffusing from one to the other. Ribosomes give the RER its “rough” appearance. Protein synthesis and glycosylation are the primary functions of the RER. In contrast, the SER functions in the synthesis of lipids and steroid hormones, removal of toxins, and the storage of intracellular calcium (Ca <sup>2+ </sup> ). Ca <sup>2+ </sup> is a powerful signaling molecule inside cells. Regulation of the release of Ca <sup>2+ </sup> from the ER is controlled by IP3 receptor (IP3R), an ER-specific protein. Other ER-specific proteins include p97, Ca <sup>2+ </sup> pumps and channels, translocon associated protein subunits (TRAP α), and a family of proteins known as reticulons .\n\n【11】In vitro model systems reproduce cellular processes outside a living cell. Because these systems consist of a simplified collection of components, they are powerful tools for investigating the contributions of the individual components to the cellular process. An in vitro model for the formation of ER tubules was developed using membranes isolated from Xenopus laevis frog eggs. A population of small (50–100 nm) spherical vesicles was isolated from lysed eggs by centrifugation. The vesicles were washed with a high concentration of salt to remove peripheral membrane proteins and any cytosolic contamination. When incubated at 25°C in the presence of 1 mM ATP and 0.5 mM GTP, the vesicles fuse and form a network.\n\n【12】Identification of the ER as the original membrane source of the small vesicles was established using several methods. The protein composition of the vesicles was examined using immunoblotting. Transmission electron microscopy also helped confirm that these small vesicles were made up of membrane derived from the ER. It was also found that the vesicles contained Ca <sup>2+ </sup> .\n\n【13】▪ Why does treatment with high salt remove peripheral membrane proteins?\n\n【14】▪ Research/review the types of proteins that are synthesized on the RER.\n\n【15】▪ Design an experiment that would confirm that the small vesicle membranes are derived from the ER and not the Golgi complex or nuclear envelope.\n\n【16】Methods\n-------\n\n【17】### Vesicle isolation\n\n【18】Eggs were collected from 10 X. laevis frogs and washed with 0.2 M NaCl to remove the external jelly coat. The eggs were transferred to a buffer solution and crushed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. The resulting egg extract was collected and centrifuged a second time at 40,000 rpm for 1 h at 2°C to pellet the larger membranous organelles. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 100,000 rpm for 1.5 h at 2°C to pellet smaller membranous organelles, leaving soluble cytosolic proteins in the supernatant. The small vesicle membrane fraction was washed twice with buffer plus 200 mM KCl before use in network formation assays.\n\n【19】### In vitro network formation\n\n【20】Salt-washed small vesicle membranes were incubated in buffer containing 200 mM KCl, 1 mM ATP, and 0.5 mM GTP at 25°C for 1 h, unless otherwise noted. For low salt incubations the 200 mM KCl was replaced with 50 mM potassium acetate. The membranes were visualized using the lipophilic fluorescent stain, octadecyl-rhodamine.\n\n【21】### Aequorin Ca <sup>2+ </sup> assay\n\n【22】Aequorin is a luminescent protein that fluoresces in the presence of Ca <sup>2+ </sup> . The intensity of the fluorescence signal is proportional to the concentration of Ca <sup>2+ </sup> in solution. The amount of Ca <sup>2+ </sup> released during network formation assays was measured in the presence of 80 nM aequorin using a luminometer. Measurements were taken every 3 min.\n\n【23】### Sulfhydryl modification and protein isolation\n\n【24】Sulfhydryl reagents act by modifying exposed sulfhydryl (SH) groups in proteins. AuCl <sub>4 </sub> and maleimide-type reagents bind to SH groups. Maleimide PEG (MP), N \\-ethylmaleimide (NEM), and maleimide neutravidin (MN) are large, membrane-impermeable compounds. Maleimide biotin (MB) is capable of crossing the membrane. The reagent dithiothreitol (DTT) acts to stabilize SH groups and prevent the binding of maleimide reagents.\n\n【25】Salt-washed membranes were incubated in the presence or absence of 5 mM MB for 20 min followed by the addition of 1 mM DTT. For some reactions, MB was pretreated with 1 mM DTT or was reacted in the presence of MP, a competing sulfhydryl reagent. The vesicles were then solubilized with the detergent, Triton X-100. Solubilized vesicle extract was incubated with avidin-coated beads. Biotinylated proteins bound to the avidin beads and were pelleted. Beads were incubated in 2 mM biotin to elute proteins off the beads. Eluted proteins were examined using SDS-PAGE.\n\n【26】▪ Create a flow chart of the steps involved in the isolation of small vesicles from Xenopus eggs.\n\n【27】▪ Why did the researchers include 200 mM KCl in the buffer used to wash the small vesicles?\n\n【28】▪ Why does it make sense to incubate the small vesicle samples at 25°C instead of 37°C?\n\n【29】▪ Define the term “lipophilic.”\n\n【30】▪ Predict whether MB will add biotin to a protein in the presence of DTT or MP?

Are reticulon proteins present in the membrane of the nuclear envelope?\n\n【46】▪ The authors conclude, “reticulons are restricted to the tubular, peripheral ER, consistent with a role in shaping this organelle.” Describe which experiment you feel best supports this conclusion.\n\n【47】▪ List some predictions you can make based on the hypothesis that reticulons are responsible for the formation of the ER membrane network\n\n【48】▪ Design an experiment to test one of your predictions.\n\n【49】Figure 7.1.1 Treatment of Xenopus egg membranes with high salt removes cytosolic and peripheral membrane proteins.  \nXenopus egg cytosol (C), small vesicle membranes (M), and salt-washed small vesicle membranes (M\\*) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (IB) with antibodies to the integral membrane ER protein IP3-receptor (IP3R), the peripheral membrane ER protein p97, or the cytosolic protein cdc2-like kinase 1 (Clk1).\n\n【50】Figure 7.1.2 In vitro network formation and the effect of SH reagents.  \na. Salt-washed small vesicles from Xenopus eggs were incubated with 200 mM KCl and 0.5 mM GTP at 25°C and examined immediately ( t <sub>0 </sub> ) or after 1 h ( t <sub>60 </sub> ). Similar membrane samples were incubated in the absence of GTP ( t <sub>60 </sub> no GTP) or in the presence of 50 mM potassium acetate ( t <sub>60 </sub> low salt). All samples were stained with octadecyl rhodamine and visualized by fluorescence microscopy. b. Ca <sup>2+ </sup> efflux from the small vesicles was measured using aequorin. The reaction was performed in the presence of 200 mM KCl and GTP (networks), low salt and GTP (vesicles) or without GTP (no fusion). Error bars indicated the standard deviation of three experiments. c. Salt-washed membranes were preincubated for 20 min at 25°C with the SH reagents: AuCl <sub>4 </sub> , maleimide PEG–5 kDa (MP), NEM, MB, MN or MN pretreated with 1 mM DTT (MN + DTT). SH reactions were stopped by the addition of 1 mM DTT prior to performing the network formation assay in the presence of 200 mM KCl and 0.5 mM GTP. d. Identification of the protein(s) modified by SH reagents was achieved using MB. The activity of MB could be inhibited by the addition of 1 mM DTT or excess MP. Biotinylated proteins from extracts of vesicles treated with the indicated combination of reagents were analyzed using SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Proteins modified only by the absence of MP were IP3 receptor and the reticulon proteins, Rtn4a/NogoA and Rtn4b/NogoB.
