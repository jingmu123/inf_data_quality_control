A chest radiograph shows an enlarged heart and bilateral pleural effusions. An echocardiogram revealed a markedly low ejection fraction.**\n\n【5】**Most likely diagnosis： Congestive heart failure secondary to dilated cardiomyopathy.**\n\n【6】**Most likely cause： Probably from chronic alcohol consumption. The most common cause of dilated cardiomyopathy is atherosclerotic coronary artery disease.**\n\n【7】**CLINICAL CORRELATION**\n\n【8】**This patient's symptoms are consistent with dilated cardiomyopathy resulting from chronic alcohol consumption. Alcoholic dilated cardiomyopathy is seen most frequently in males 35 to 55 years old. Typically， there is a long history of excessive alcohol consumption； usually， drinking more than 90 g (eight standard drinks) per day for over 5 years is associated with dilated cardiomy-opathy， which may be asymptomatic. Alcohol may have a direct toxic effect on the heart， or cardiac signs may be secondary to vitamin deficiency from alcoholism. In dilated cardiomyopathy， the heart shows areas of hypertrophy with an increase in mass usually of 600 g or more in the adult heart. Other areas of the heart may show myofibril thinning and myofiber loss， presumably through alterations in gene expression and apoptosis. Evidence of damage with interstitial and endocardial fibrosis is seen frequently. Heart failure results from ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular (LV) function can be measured by the LV ejection fraction (LVEF)， which is the volume of blood ejected (volume at the end of diastole minus the volume at the end of systole) divided by the volume at the end of diastole， expressed as a percentage. The normal ejection fraction is 50 percent or higher and congestive failure usually is seen with an LVEF of 40 percent or less. Signs and symptoms of heart fail-ure are the result of reduced cardiac output or reduced venous drainage or a combination of both. Congestion in the lungs can lead to dyspnea， which can manifest sometimes as orthopnea (dyspnea when lying down)， or orthopnea that is worse at night： paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND). Congestion not uncommonly involves the liver， spleen， kidneys，and brain. Fluid accumulation in the pleural spaces， pericardial spaces， and subcutaneous tissue may occur， leading to edema or， when generalized and massive， anasarca.**\n\n【9】**APPROACH TO ALCOHOLIC CARDIOMYOPATHY**\n\n【10】**Objectives**\n\n【11】Describe the classifications of the various cardiomyopathies.\n\n【12】**Describe the causes of the various cardiomyopathies.**\n\n【13】**删除17：<u>春</u> List the effects of alcohol on the heart.**\n\n【14】**Definitions**\n\n【15】**Cardiomyopathy： Disease of the myocardium with associated clinical signs and symptoms of cardiac dysfunction.**\n\n【16】**Dilated cardiomyopathy： Damaged myocardium that results in increased ventricular mass and size， with dilation of the chambers and thinning of the ventricle walls.**\n\n【17】**Congestive heart failure： The result of left ventricular dysfunction with resultant organ congestion and edema.**\n\n【18】**Beriberi heart disease： Heart failure as a result of a high-output state sec-ondary to thiamine deficiency from chronic alcoholism. Clinically， it may not be distinguishable from alcoholic dilated cardiomyopathy.**\n\n【19】**DISCUSSION**\n\n【20】**Classification of Cardiomyopathies**\n\n【21】**Cardiomyopathies are a group of disorders that entail myocyte injury， result-ing in cardiac dysfunction. They can be classified broadly into three categories-dilated， hypertrophic， and restrictive cardiomyopathies—reflecting the resultant condition or function of the chambers of the heart . These terms do not denote specific mechanisms or etiologies but describe the state of the myocardial dysfunction. Dilated cardiomyopathy is by far the most common form and results from enlargement and dilation of the ventricles. Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have decreased diastolic filling with loss of ventricular volume， usually associated with out-flow obstruction without attendant dilation of the ventricles. In about half these cases of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy， there is a familial inherited basis. Restrictive cardiomyopathy usually is due to an infiltrative process. Patients tend to have impaired ventricular compliance with decreased diastolic filling.**\n\n【22】**Causes of Dilated Cardiomyopathies**\n\n【23】**Coronary artery disease， endocrine disorders， alcohol， myocarditis， drugs， and toxins are common causes of dilated cardiomyopathy. Among them， the most common cause in the United States is coronary artery disease. Direct damage or ischemia to the myocytes results in loss of injured myocytes**\n\n【24】**Table 31-1**\n\n【25】**CLASSIFICATION AND CAUSES OF CARDIOMYOPATHIES**\n\n| **TYPE OF CARDIOMYOPATHY**  | **CAUSES**  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Dilated**  | **Ischemic** **Alcohol， toxic** **Pregnancy induced** **Coxsackie B virus** **Chronic cocaine use** **Doxorubicin** **Chagas disease** **Endocrine disorders** **Myocarditis， infectious** **Genetic**  |  |\n| **Hypertrophic**  | **Genetics** **Storage disease** **Pheochromocytoma**  |  |\n| **Restrictive**  | **Infiltrative processSarcoid** **Amyloidosis** **HemochromatosisRadiation fibrosis**  |  |\n\n【27】**with attendant fibrosis and scarring. There is hypertrophy of residual myocytes， which can lead to an overall increase in myocardial mass. With dila-tion， there is usually thinning of the ventricular wall thickness， and eventually this can lead to congestive heart failure.**\n\n【28】Signs and symptoms of heart failure include dyspnea on exertion， easy fati-gability， edema involving the extremities and lungs， and abnormalities in heartbeat. Ventricular dilation also can lead to arrhythmias and thromboem-bolus formation. Additional studies that can aid in the diagnosis include chest x-rays， chest computed tomography (CT)， and cardiac function studies， includ-ing echocardiography and electrocardiography (ECG). Endomyocardial biopsy may be performed for diagnosis and exclude other causes.\n\n【29】**Alcohol and Its Effects on the Heart**\n\n【30】**The normal myocardium is composed of myocytes and the interstitium， which is highly vascular. Myocytes are specialized striated muscle that are rich in mito-chondria and depend on aerobic metabolism. Cardiac function requires the trans-mission of neural signals， which is mediated through the specialized smooth endoplasmic reticulum known as the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The contractile**\n\n【31】**ability of myocytes requires the functioning of the sarcomeric unit， which is formed from actin and myosin units. Intercalated disk and gap junctions allow the connection and communication of individual myocytes into an organized synchronized contractile unit. The fact that alcohol has a deleterious effect on the heart has been known for over 100 years. Current studies suggest that the effect of alcohol on the heart may occur through a toxic metabolite： acetalde-hyde. The cellular site of the effect may be the myocyte mitochondria. Additionally， alcohol has been shown to be responsible for thiamine deficiency， which in severe cases can lead to beriberi heart disease and may not be distin-guishable from other causes of dilated cardiomyopathy. Noncardiac effects of alcohol include fatty liver (steatosis)， cirrhosis， pancreatitis， and central nervous system syndromes (Korsakoff and Wernicke syndromes).**\n\n【32】**Treatment**\n\n【33】**Treatment of dilated cardiomyopathy includes removing the toxic insult (i.e.， stopping alcohol consumption). This can lead to improvement in cardiac func-tion. Symptomatic relief for heart failure may be achieved by means of restrict-ing fluids and salt intake， diuretics， angiotension-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors， and B-blockers. Vitamins are required in patients with vitamin defi-ciencies. Coumadin sometimes is required for patients at risk of thromboem-bolic disease. In cases of end-stage heart failure， patients have received cardiac transplants.**", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

His daughter, with whom he lives, read about a nursing home in Arizona where the policy is to make the patients as happy as possible. Thus, treatment includes chocolate and cocktails. The daughter began to use that philosophy, and noticed that her own stress level went down and her father is now calmer and more cooperative. | Georgia (55, African-American, married) had surgery for breast cancer a year ago, followed by chemotherapy, and is now feeling restored to good health.

Even though she had reconstructive surgery, she is disgusted by her body, and she grimaces at the thought of her husband seeing her undressed. | A psychology graduate student, Pamela (32, White, single), was experiencing fatigue and difficulty concentrating, symptoms that she attributed to “stress” and “depression.” Despite her loss of appetite, she was gaining weight and her waistband was getting tighter and tighter.

In fact, some symptoms can cause us to consider the Emergency hypothesis: If immediate action is not taken, the patient is at risk for death or serious disability. One of the biggest errors that a therapist can make is failing to detect symptoms of a possibly fatal or disabling medical disorder. You need to be aware that psychological symptoms (e.g. anxiety, depression, memory impairments, and changes in personality) can be caused by both biological and psychosocial disorders.\n\n【9】### Medically Unexplained Symptoms\n\n【10】Sometimes clients are referred to mental health professionals when physicians cannot find a diagnosis for symptoms. The assumption will usually be that the person is a “somatizer,” converting psychological distress to physical symptoms, which therefore do not have biological causation. However, we need to leave room for the possibility that the symptoms have a medical cause that has not yet been discovered by medical science. Chronic fatigue syndrome used to be called _neurasthenia_ and was viewed as a form of neurosis, whereas it is now accepted as a physical illness for which there is no definable cause. In the future, research might find that the cause is a virus, environmental toxins, or neuroendocrine malfunction. The term _medically unexplained symptoms_ (MUS) is useful because, unlike the term _somatization_ , it does not assume the presence of a psychiatric disorder.\n\n【11】### Biological Causation With Co-Occurring Disorders\n\n【12】Medical problems may coexist with psychiatric disorders; in fact, a large percentage of patients in a primary care practice have undetected depression. To complicate matters, the same symptoms may stem from both biological and psychosocial causes. The most common example of this is the coexistence of depression and medical illness. Depression can be a symptom of the illness and a consequence of difficulty coping with the illness—and the same person can have depression stemming from both causes. Depression in elderly clients is common because of their multiple physical impairments, social isolation, and grief from many losses and therefore, often coexists with dementia, complicating the diagnostic process. Anxiety disorders and substance abuse also can accompany biologically based disorders.\n\n【13】### When Is This Hypothesis a Good Match?\n\n【14】Table 9.1 gives examples of problem titles that are frequently associated with medical issues.\n\n【15】Table 9.1 Sample Problems for Biological Cause (BE1) Hypothesis\n\n| Problems associated with brain damage | Inadequate self-careRisk of violence or injuryFrustration over inability to communicate needs |\n| --- | --- |\n| Difficulties coping with medical disorders | Refusal to modify work schedule despite debilitating weakness from chemotherapyNoncompliance with doctor’s instructionsDifficulty asserting needs with medical personnel |\n| Problems of caregivers | Need for respite from caregiver responsibilitiesEngaging in elder abuseDifficulty coping with spouse’s loss of memory |\n| Problems associated with terminal illness | Indecision about entering hospice programRefusal to face grief over impending death (for patient as well as family)Difficulty coping with family members’ refusal to talk about death |\n| Problems associated with drug addiction | Drug-seeking, criminal behaviorInability to fulfill occupational obligationsInability to sustain healthy relationshipsLegal problems stemming from sale of illegal substances |\n\n【17】### Medical Disorders\n\n【18】The need for medical referral is recognized by such data as impaired memory, concentration, and consciousness; changes in appetite, weight, sleep patterns, mood, and personality traits; events such as head injury, illnesses, and accidents; and family members’ reports of poor grooming, neglect of home and health, and loss of competence at work. Delirium, dementia, and amnesia are associated with such medical conditions as vascular disease (stroke); intracranial injury (head trauma); HIV disease; and a variety of diseases named after their discoverers—Alzheimer, Parkinson, Huntington, Pick, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob.\n\n【19】Medical conditions can “masquerade” as mental disorders 删除10：<u>(Taylor, 2007)</u>: they cause anxiety, depression, mania, psychosis, delirium, dementia, uncontrollable rage, and personality changes. Commonplace symptoms, such as anxiety or depression, may be treated as purely psychological when, in fact, they might be caused by medical conditions such as thyroid disorders, renal failure, an autoimmune disease like lupus, or electrolyte imbalance.\n\n【20】### Substance-Related Disorders\n\n【21】Problems with drugs and alcohol are extremely common and should be considered with every client. Clinicians need to probe for frequency and quantity of consumption. Recognition of substance use is especially important with pregnant women and clients who need intact impulse control, such as potentially suicidal clients. Many hypotheses need to be integrated to provide treatment for people who abuse substances. Here are examples of when the present, past, or prospective use of substances fits with the Biological Cause hypothesis.\n\n【22】1.  _Intoxication:_ The ingestion of alcohol and drugs can result in a transient, reversible syndrome called _intoxication_ , which produces changes and impairments in the client’s mental status.\n2.  _Physical drug dependence:_ Whereas _psychological dependence_ means that the user has a subjective need for the drug to reach a desired level of functioning or sense of well-being, _physical dependence_ refers to a physiological condition where the body needs the drug, and will develop withdrawal symptoms if the use of the drug is abruptly terminated.\n3.  _Addictive substances can mimic/cause psychiatric symptoms and syndromes:_ Depression results from alcohol, sedatives, and marijuana use, as well as from withdrawal from stimulants. Anxiety results from the use of stimulants and from withdrawal from alcohol and sedatives. Paranoia can be associated with use of and withdrawal from stimulants, as well as from marijuana. Hallucinogenic drugs, stimulants, and alcohol/sedative withdrawal can produce psychotic symptoms. Insomnia is associated with both use and withdrawal.\n4.  _Medical model of addiction:_ Alcohol and other drug addictions can be viewed as treatable chronic diseases of the brain, with periodic relapses being part of the expected course of the illness. Genetic causation has been demonstrated by family studies: Monozygotic twins have higher concordance for addiction than dizygotic twins, and adopted children whose biological parents were alcoholics have an increased probability of developing alcoholism even when raised from birth by nonalcoholic parents. Recently, the mapping of the genome has revealed specific genes that are associated with increased substance abuse.\n5.  _Chronic drug/alcohol use as the cause of medical conditions:_ Substance use, along with obesity, is a major preventable cause of death. We know how nicotine addiction contributes to disease and death. Long-term use of drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamines can result in irreversible damage to the brain. The consequences of prolonged alcohol abuse are illustrated in this case example:\n    1.  A 40-year-old Mexican-American man, a successful writer, denied that alcohol was a problem in his life. Even after he broke his leg in an alcohol-related accident, he claimed that it was an exceptional circumstance. Finally, he was arrested for driving under the influence and was forced to attend AA meetings. He successfully terminated alcohol use and attended AA until completion of his probation. Six months later, his neighbor found him dead, holding a bottle of vodka. The autopsy report showed severe liver damage and extreme cardiomyopathy—“His heart looked like that of a man twice his age,” the pathologist explained.\n\n【23】### Difficulty Coping With Medical Condition or Physical Disability\n\n【24】Biologically based conditions involve emotional, behavioral, spiritual, and cognitive dimensions including subjective level of pain, intensity of emotional distress, the need to develop new skills, loss of meaning in life, alterations in cognitive maps, demands to make difficult decisions, social isolation, and disruption to the functioning of the family. Often just receiving a serious diagnosis can overwhelm a person’s ability to cope. Conditions that therapists might encounter include aphasia following a stroke, amputation following war service, paraplegia from an accident, and partial or complete loss of functioning in one of the sense organs. The aging process involves physical changes that interfere with mobility and can cause chronic pain.\n\n【25】### Coping With Genetic “Givens”\n\n【26】Clients may benefit from recognizing when certain traits and qualities are hardwired into their makeup, the makeup of a child, or that of a significant other. Examples include character traits like introversion/extraversion, aptitudes and talents for mathematics or music, sexual orientation and gender identity, and aspects of physical appearance. This hypothesis is useful when counseling parents who want their violinist son to be an athlete or their athletic daughter to be a bookworm. When parents are able to acknowledge their child’s core, unchangeable characteristics, their frustration is reduced and the psychological well-being of the child is enhanced. As genetic research progresses, there will be a greater understanding of inherited characteristics and new discoveries that will overcome genetic limitations. Therapists may be in helping roles to clients who need to make choices about genetic testing. For instance, if a Jewish woman of Eastern European background with a family history of breast cancer discusses her decision to get tested to see if she carries the mutation of the _BRCA2_ gene associated with breast cancer, the therapist will need to explore the pros and cons and how she would cope if she receives bad news.\n\n【27】### Sexuality\n\n【28】Many aspects of sexual functioning are biologically hardwired. When parents have trouble accepting the sexual orientation of their gay, lesbian, or bisexual child, they need to understand that same-sex attraction is an innate part of a person’s makeup. For women, the release of oxytocin during sexual intercourse creates the same bond to the sexual partner as that which occurs with their newborn infant; thus, biology can contribute to their difficulty terminating a relationship that the mind judges to be a poor choice.\n\n【29】### Opportunities for Prevention\n\n【30】Often clients describe behaviors or lifestyle choices—smoking, overeating, excessive drinking, unprotected sex, and reckless driving—that put them at risk for developing medical problems (or death). For instance, a lifestyle of high stress, workaholism, overeating, and lack of exercise can contribute to heart conditions. Anorexia nervosa and the accompanying condition of starvation affect metabolism, heart rate and pulse, blood pressure, skin and hair, and bone density. For bulimics, the effects of purging include electrolyte imbalance, which can cause heart attack and brain damage. Therapists can formulate problems in ways that promote prevention and early interventions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

As a result， the alveoli need a longer time to exhale. Thus the inspiratory/expiratory ratio needs to be adjusted on the ventilator. Since the patient has been on an indefinite number of days of steroid therapy， adrenal insufficiency needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis of refractory hypotension should it occur.\n\n【11】\\> Likely postoperative concerns： In the post-anesthetic period this patient is at the highest risk for pulmonary complications including but not limited to hypoxia， bronchospasm， and pneumonia.\n\n【12】**ANALYSIS**\n\n【13】**Objectives**\n\n【14】1\\. Understand the issues involved in the preoperative evaluation and assess-ment of suitability for surgery in a patient with COPD undergoing elective surgery.\n\n【15】2\\. Understand the intraoperative management of ventilation under general anesthesia in a patient with COPD.\n\n【16】3\\. Understand postoperative complications in a patient with severe COPD.\n\n【17】**Considerations**\n\n【18】This is a 53-year-old obese woman who presents for a laparoscopic cholecystec-tomy under general anesthesia. She has moderately severe COPD， which seems to be under reasonable control. However， she is currently treated with long-acting beta-2 agonists， which have been shown to actually increase the mortality in patients with asthma. She has required steroids in the past 6 months， which 删除换行 suggests that her COPD is moderately severe. In addition， the exposure to steroids also predisposes the patient to the possibility of adrenal insufficiency.\n\n【19】The standard monitors recommended by the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) are sufficient， and there is no real indication for invasive monitoring in this case. During induction and maintenance， agents such as thiopental and desflurane should be avoided since the former can cause bronchoconstriction， and the later is the most irritating general anes-thetic to the airway. Following the induction of general anesthesia， the ven-tilator's inspiratory/expiratory ratio is adjusted to accommodate the patient’s prolonged expiratory phase， and a small amount of PEEP is added to decrease work of breathing. Both of these maneuvers result in optimal peak and plateau pressures.\n\n【20】The patient's pulmonary function tests indicate that she has small airways and an element of broncho-reactivity. This renders her susceptible to bron-chospasm， and also responsive to bronchodilator agents. The patient should be asked to use her inhalers prior to surgery.\n\n【21】Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is typically associated with little blood loss， so the fluid management should be judicious given the higher likelihood for pulmonary edema in this patient. Indeed， a common saying is “keep the lungs dry，\"and it applies to many if not most pulmonary surgical procedures. The presence of COPD exacerbates the possibility of atelectasis， pneumonia， and hypoxemia in the postoperative period. Pain control is an important consid-eration in the postoperative period. The use of narcotics may potentiate res-piratory depression and failure in the setting of atelectasis， while inadequate pain control may result in splinting and inadequate respiratory effort， which will exacerbate atelectasis as well.\n\n【22】**Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease**\n\n【23】**DEFINITIONS**\n\n【24】COPD： Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a slowly progres-sive lung disease that results in progressive shortness of breath and a declin-ing activity level. It includes a spectrum of illnesses such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis.\n\n【25】LAPAROSCOPIC CHOLECYSTECTOMY： Surgical procedure of removal of the gall bladder via small incisions on the abdomen. The entire abdominal cavity is visualized by means of a laparoscope inserted after creation of a pneu-moperitoneum.\n\n【26】**CLINICAL APPROACH**\n\n【27】**Preoperative Evaluation**\n\n【28】The preoperative evaluation for any patient prior to surgery includes assess-ment of exercise tolerance. In the setting of COPD， focused questioning may reveal a subtle decline in exercise over a period of years (eg， using a push lawn mower to a power lawn mower to paying someone to mow the lawn). Primary care physicians often have a low threshold for cardiac stress testing， to ferret out presence of concomitant cardiac disease.\n\n【29】In a patient with proven COPD， the next assessment should be the adequacy of therapy. A stable inhaler regimen with minimal use of breakthrough inhalers， no requirement for oral steroids， and an absence of frequent bronchitis/pneumonia represent “stable”COPD. A subset of patients with COPD has alveolar thick-ening and loss of lung area， resulting in a decrement in diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO). A low DLCO implies an impaired oxygen uptake by the alveolus， and may necessitate implementation of home oxygen therapy. Other causes of low DLCO are cardiac insufficiency， anemia， and pulmonary hypertension.\n\n【30】Pulmonary function tests may identify a response to bronchodilator therapy， if it is present. Oddly， broncho-reactivity is most common in the moderate stage of COPD. Resting arterial blood gas testing helps identify the level of baseline ventilation as evidenced by degree of arterial carbon dioxide (CO，) retention， as does the bicarbonate (HCO，) level. In the presence of an elevated Paco。 there is typically a conservation of HCO， by the kidney. Thus， elevated CO， in patients with COPD is often accompanied by a concomitant increase in HCO。 It is important to have baseline CO， and HCO， levels， as they determine the intraoperative ventilation strategies. Hyperventilation in these patients， in attempt to normalize CO。 leads to renal bicarbonate wasting and metabolic acidosis.\n\n【31】**Intraoperative Management**\n\n【32】In patients with a significant bronchospastic component to their COPD， patients should be asked to use their inhalers prior to the induction of general anesthesia. Routine monitoring is appropriate. Thiopental and histamine-releasing drugs such as morphine and succinylcholine should be avoided if possible. Laryngoscopy and intubation should only be attempted after ensur-ing an adequate depth of anesthesia， or bronchospasm may result. One option involves spraying the trachea with 4% lidocaine prior to intubation. While the lidocaine does anesthetize the trachea and reduce the foreign body response to intubation， the spray occasionally also provokes a foreign body response. Use of this maneuver varies widely by practitioner.\n\n【33】The anesthetic maintenance regimen typically includes a combination of inhaled agents and narcotics. Respiratory management should take into 删除换行 account the pathophysiology of COPD， which involves the loss of alveolar elasticity and impaired ventilation/perfusion mismatch (V/Q). The extent of V/Q mismatch in COPD reflects the extent of lung tissue destroyed. During exacerbations of COPD，V/Q mismatch worsens. Ventilator management includes a long exhalation time to counter the loss of alveolar elasticity. The judicious use of PEEP can improve oxygenation in the setting of hyperinflation. PEEP also increases the intrathoracic pressure somewhat， and if excessive， can impair venous return. The optimal level of PEEP does not decrease cardiac output(blood pressure can be used as a surrogate for cardiac output).\n\n【34】The emergence from general anesthesia is a critical time for patients with COPD. Rapid shallow breaths of low tidal volume are consistent with respi-ratory failure. This breathing pattern can be followed by progressive hyper-capnia， respiratorymuscle fatigue， andrespiratory failure. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) increases patient comfort while decreas-ing the work of breathing， and over the long term decreases mortality. NPPV is commonly administered in the form of bi-level positive airway pressure(BiPAP) by means of a specialized BiPAP mask. This form of ventilation decreases atelectasis， improves oxygenation， and；also decreases work of breathing. However， it does require concerted patient cooperation.\n\n【35】Fluid management in patients with COPD is targeted toward euvolemia. In the presence of significant lung dysfunction， even a minor fluid overload can precipitate pulmonary edema and delay tracheal extubation. Neuraxial blockade is the preferred anesthetic in a patient with severe COPD if the procedure is amenable， as there is a decreased incidence of respiratory depres-sion and failure.\n\n【36】In addition to bronchospasm， other complications should be considered when caring for a patient with COPD. Sudden cardiovascular collapse could represent a ruptured emphysematous bleb， particularly if mechanical (positive pressure) ventilation is used. And if the patient is on steroids， the presence of sustained hypotension after anesthetic causes have been eliminated， the possibility of adrenal insufficiency secondary to prolonged steroid use should be considered. It is common practice to administer supplemental \"stress-dose’9of steroids； typically， hydrocortisone is administered every 6 hours for the first24-hour period. However， this practice andsteroid regimen are entirely empirical， and has not been shown to influence outcomes.\n\n【37】**Postoperative Management**\n\n【38】Postoperative pain relief is vital in the presence of COPD. Pain increases patient splinting and predisposes them to atelectasis andpneumonia. However， narcotics are also associated with respiratory depression and the requirement for re-intubation. BiPAP is an option as a treatment for hypoxemia. Weaning from BiPAP is dictated by patient comfort (no use of accessory muscles， adequate oxygenation， and ventilation) as well as pulse oximetrv.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Renal failure is a very dangerous adverse event associated with non- steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The patient was in CHF when he first presented. His cardiologist consequently treated him with a diuretic, intending to reduce his total body fluids. When the amount of fluids in the body contracts, the body attempts to compensate by releasing angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor. In order to protect the kidney from losing its perfusion due to this vasocon- striction, the kidney simultaneously releases prostaglandins at both the afferent and efferent arterioles, where they act as vasodilators. By taking an NSAID like ibuprofen and inhibiting the cyclooxygenase (COX)-l and COX-2 enzymes, this patient blocked the pathway producing the prostaglandins that were keeping the afferent arterioles dilated and thus keeping his kidneys perfused. His renal failure is pre-renal in origin, resulting from the constriction of these arterioles.  \n\n【7】Answer A is incorrect. NSAIDs will block the production of prostaglandin E2 at both arterioles, but the constriction of the afferent arteriole is the primary cause of this man’s renal failure.  \n\n【8】Answer C is incorrect. While NSAIDs would also have blocked the production of prostaglandin E2 at the efferent arteriole, this would not cause renal failure, it would actually increase glomerular filtration rate (blocking the outflow without blocking the inflow will increase filtration). This would not cause the patient to present with oliguria or a rising creatinine level.  \n\n【9】Answer D is incorrect. Ibuprofen blocks the synthesis of prostaglandins, and thus a decrease in the prostaglandin level would be seen, not an increase.  \n\n【10】Answer E is incorrect. Ibuprofen blocks the synthesis of prostaglandins, and thus a decrease in the prostaglandin level would be seen, not an increase.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The importance of this condition lies  删除换行 in the fact that it causes strangulation of the blood supply  删除换行 to the testis and unless it is treated within 3 to 4 hours,  删除换行 testicular atrophy is inevitable.\n\n【2】(i) Inversion of the testis.\n\n【3】(ii) Long mesorchium — in this case the body of  删除换行 the testis only rotates without involving the spermatic  删除换行 cord, that means torsion of the testis occurs without  删除换行 torsion of the spermatic cord.\n\n【4】(iii) Undescended and ectopic testes. 7% of all cases  删除换行 of torsion occurred in undescended testes.\n\n【5】(iv) High investment of tunical vaginalis — it causes  删除换行 the testis to hang within the tunica vaginalis which may  删除换行 initiate rotation.\n\n【6】(v) A voluminous tunica vaginalis — this also gives  删除换行 adequate space to the testis to rotate.\n\n【7】(vi) Injury.— A clear history of injury preceded the  删除换行 onset of torsion in 5% of cases. History of injury from  删除换行 sports is also received which was commonest in football  删除换行 and rugby followed by bicycle riding. Testicular torsion228 A TEXTBOOK OF SURGICAL SHORT CASES 删除换行 also followed coitus.\n\n【8】(vii) Ambient temperature.— Testicular torsion is  删除换行 more commonly seen during cold months of the year.\n\n【9】It should be borne in mind that the abnormality which 删除换行 causes torsion is usually bilateral.\n\n【10】Initiating factors.— Spasm of the cremaster muscle  删除换行 which inserts on the cord obliquely seems to be the main  删除换行 initiating factor. Contraction of this muscle causes the  删除换行 left testis to rotate anticlockwise and the right testis  删除换行 clockwise. Contraction of cremaster occurs at the time of  删除换行 straining at stool, lifting heavy weight and coitus. It must  删除换行 be remembered that torsion also occurs during sleep and  删除换行 in most instances there is congenital abnormality either  删除换行 in the descent of the testis or in the tunica vaginalis or in  删除换行 the spermatic cord.\n\n【11】Torsion usually occurs from without  删除换行 inwards that means the left testis rotates anticlockwise  删除换行 and the right testis rotates clockwise. With the vascular  删除换行 occlusion which occurs in torsion, there is oedema of the  删除换行 testis and the cord upto the point of occlusion. Gradually  删除换行 it leads to gangrene of the testis and epididymis.\n\n【12】Duration of torsion and outcome.— Symptoms of  删除换行 more than 10 hours duration evokes some doubt  删除换行 concerning the viability of the testis. With a minimum  删除换行 follow-up of 3 months 35 of 47patients had variable  删除换行 degrees of testicular atrophy. The mean duration of torsion  删除换行 in those with immediately non-viable testes was 36 hours.\n\n【13】UNDESCENDED TESTIS\n\n【14】Age.— Torsion is most commonly seen between 10  删除换行 and 25 years of age. As the cause is congenital, the second  删除换行 most common incidence is seen during infancy. About  删除换行 62% cases occur between the ages of 12 and 18 years. \n\n【15】20% of cases of torsion occurred in men aged 21 years or  删除换行 more and 6% occurred in men aged 31 years or above. \n\n【16】Highest incidence is at about 15 to 16 years.\n\n【17】Side.— There is no predilection for side and torsion  删除换行 can occur in any side.\n\n【18】Family history.— Family history is not very common  删除换行 in this condition though it may be received in 5% of  删除换行 cases.\n\n【19】CLINICAL FEATURES.—\n\n【20】Patient suddenly complains of severe pain in one  删除换行 testicle or in the groin. The pain is sudden and agonizing. \n\n【21】Pain is often referred to the lower abdomen and in right  删除换行 side appendicitis has been wrongly diagnosed in such  删除换行 cases.\n\n【22】Nausea and vomiting are very common.\n\n【23】In completely descended testis diagnosis is rather  删除换行 easier, but in incompletely descended testis it is difficult  删除换行 to differentiate from a strangulated inguinal hernia.\nHISTORY.—\n\n【24】The scrotum is swollen and tender.The scrotum may  删除换行 also be normal or red and oedematous. Sometimes it is  删除换行 difficult to differentiate from acute epididymo-orchitis. \n\n【25】Elevation of the scrotum usually relieves pain in epididymo删除8：<u>￾</u>orchitis, but increases the pain in torsion of the spermatic 删除换行 cord.\n\n【26】In torsion, if the testis can be carefully palpated, it is  删除换行 often lying in the horizontal position.\n\n【27】Gradually within a few hours after onset the patient  删除换行 becomes pyrexic with slight leucocytosis.\n\n【28】Torsion can be differentiated from epididymitis by  删除换行 using Doppler stethoscope in conjunction with  删除换行 ultrasound. The testis which has been made ischaemic  删除换行 with torsion will not echo sound; hypervascularity of  删除换行 epididymis will increase sound. Differentiation can also  删除换行 be made by a rectilinear scan following intravenous  删除换行 injection of 99mTc. The Doppler stethoscope in  删除换行 conjunction with ultrasound is very simple test which  删除换行 quickly diagnoses this condition.\n\n【29】Differential diagnosis.\n\n【30】The two most important differential diagnoses are —\n\n【31】(i) Acute epididymo-orchitis — in case of torsion  删除换行 of completely descended testis. Epididymitis is unusual  删除换行 before the age of 25 years.\n\n【32】(ii) Strangulated inguinal hernia — in case of tor删除8：<u>￾</u>sion of incompletely descended testis.\n\n【33】Other important conditions are —\n\n【34】(iii) Mumps orchitis.\n\n【35】(iv) Trauma.\n\n【36】When in doubt, it is better to consider the diagnosis  删除换行 as torsion of the testis and the testis should be explored  删除换行 immediately. Even in wrong diagnosis surgical exploration  删除换行 will not do any harm but waiting for making correct  删除换行 diagnosis may lead to death of the testis.\n\n【37】SYMPTOMS.—\n\n【38】(i) If the patient comes to the surgeon early, manual  删除换行 detorsion may be tried. It should be remembered that in  删除换行 torsion the left testis rotates anticlockwise and the right  删除换行 testis rotates clockwise. Therefore for detorsion the  删除换行 concerned testis should be rotated in the opposite  删除换行 direction that means the left testis should be ‘screwed’,  删除换行 whereas the right testis should be ‘unscrewed’. Detorsion  删除换行 will relieve pain immediately, so this is a good index to  删除换行 know that the manoeuvre has been correctly performed,  删除换行 otherwise pain will increase.\n\n【39】Even if detorsion is successful surgical fixation of both  删除换行 testes should be achieved within the next few days.\n\n【40】(ii) If manual detorsion fails, immediate surgical  删除换行 exploration is required. If the testis is viable, it must be  删除换行 fixed so that torsion does not recur. Even though the  删除换行 viability of the testis is questioned the seminiferous  删除换行 tubules may be necrotic, yet the most hardy interstitialTESTIS, EPIDIDYMIS AND SCROTUM 229 删除换行 cells may remain viable. Excision of the parietal tunica  删除换行 vaginalis will cause the testis to stick to the scrotal wall.\n\n【41】As the predisposing factors which cause torsion are  删除换行 bilaterally present, it is always advisable to fix the opposite 删除换行 testis in the same fashion at the same sitting.\n\n【42】A totally infarcted testis should be excised.\n\n【43】(iii) When the patient comes too late after days or  删除换行 weeks the torsion has occurred, one cannot achieve much  删除换行 by exploring the affected side; but the opposite testis must 删除换行 be fixed as early as possible. Orchidectomy of the afftected  删除换行 testis is justified.\n\n【44】If detorsion is done within 12 hours of  删除换行 onset — the result is good with 100% success.\n\n【45】If detorsion is done from 12 to 24 hours after torsion  删除换行 has occurred — recovery is possible in majority of cases.\n\n【46】Detorsion can be advised, from 24 to 36 hours, but  删除换行 preservation is doubtful.\n\n【47】If the case is delayed by more than 48 hours — or删除8：<u>￾</u>chidectomy is more advisable than detorsion.\n\n【48】EXAMINATIONS.—\nVaricocele means varicosity of the veins of the  删除换行 spermatic cord. The veins become dilated, elongated and  删除换行 tortuous. The veins of the spermatic cord include the  删除换行 pampiniform plexus i.e. testicular veins and the  删除换行 cremasteric veins. Occasionally testicular veins may be  删除换行 normal, but the cremasteric veins become varicosed.\n\n【49】Veins of the spermatic cord in删除8：<u>￾</u>clude 3 groups of veins —\n\n【50】(i) Veins draining the testis and epididymis.\n\n【51】(ii) Veins accompanying the vas deferens.\n\n【52】(iii) Veins of the cremasteric muscle.\n\n【53】Veins of the testis and epididymis which form the  删除换行 pampiniform plexus is the most bulky constituent of the  删除换行 spermatic cord. As the veins pass up from the testis and  删除换行 epididymis they are about 15 to 20 in numbers. As the  删除换行 veins pass through the inguinal canal upwards they  删除换行 become reduced in number to 4 to 8. Just deep to the  删除换行 deep inguinal ring these veins further coalesce to form  删除换行 two veins. When these two veins enter the abdomen they  删除换行 unite to form a single vein, called testicular vein and move  删除换行 upwards by the side of the testicular artery in the  删除换行 posterior abdominal wall behind the peritoneum. The  删除换行 right testicular vein drains into the inferior vena cava,  删除换行 whereas the left testicular vein drains into the left renal  删除换行 vein at right angle.\n\n【54】These testicular veins are mostly devoid of valves except  删除换行 near their terminations where they are provided with  删除换行 valves.\n\n【55】The cremasteric veins anastomose freely with the  删除换行 testicular veins and these veins drain into the inferior  删除换行 epigastric vein.\n\n【56】Causes.—\n\n【57】(i) Majority of the cases are idiopathic and no  删除换行 definite cause can be found out.\n\n【58】(ii) Tall, thin, visceroptotic men are prone to develop  删除换行 this condition.\n\n【59】(iii) As the left testicular vein drains into the left  删除换行 renal vein at right angle, some obstruction at the place of  删除换行 drainage is expected.\n\n【60】(iv) Sometimes the left testicular artery arches over\n删除3：<u>Fig. 18.5.— Shows the anatomical reasons of varicocele. Note that if the left testicular artery arches over the left renal vein it may obstruct the </u>\n\n【61】drainage of left testicular vein giving rise to left sided varicocele. Superior mesenteric artery may press the left renal vein to cause left sided 删除换行 varicocele.230 A TEXTBOOK OF SURGICAL SHORT CASES 删除换行 the left renal vein and may obstruct it, this will lead to  删除换行 obstruction in drainage of the left testicular vein and  删除换行 varicocele may occur .\n\n【62】(v) Sometimes cremasteric veins become dilated  删除换行 which freely communicate with the pampiniform plexus  删除换行 and drain into the inferior epigastric veins.\n\n【63】(vi) Varicocele may be secondary to hypernephroma  删除换行 of the left kidney. The growth from the hypernephroma  删除换行 blocks the renal vein by venous permeation and prevents  删除换行 drainage of the testicular vein as the left testicular vein  删除换行 drains into the left renal vein. So sudden onset of  删除换行 varicocele in middle aged man should arouse suspicion  删除换行 of a hypernephroma of the leit kidney.\n\n【64】Predilection for the left side.— In more than 90% of  删除换行 cases the varicocele is seen on ihe left side. The possible  删除换行 causes are :\n\n【65】(a) The left testicular vein drains into the left renal  删除换行 vein at right angle so there is chance of blockage of  删除换行 drainage from the left testicular vein. But the right  删除换行 testicular vein opens obliquely into the inferior vena cava  删除换行 and this drainage occurs freely.\n\n【66】(b) The total length of the testicular vein is more on  删除换行 the left side than on the right side — as the left testicular  删除换行 vein drains at a higher level and the left testis hangs at a  删除换行 lower level.\n\n【67】(c) In about 15% of cases left testicular artery arches  删除换行 over the left renal vein and thus obstruct it and hence to  删除换行 drainage of the left testicular vein.\n\n【68】(d) The loaded sigmoid colon may press upon the  删除换行 testicular vein and cause varicocele due to obstruction in  删除换行 drainage.\n\n【69】(e) The left suprarenal vein also drains into the left  删除换行 renal vein and circulating adrenaline may cause  删除换行 constriction of the testicular vein at the site of drainage.\n\n【70】(f) The left renal vein passes between abdominal aorta  删除换行 behind and the superior mesenteric artery in front and  删除换行 may be pressurised by these two arteries which may lead  删除换行 to obstruction in its drainage and hence the left testicular  删除换行 vein to cause varicocele of the left side.\n\n【71】(g) Incompetent valves are more common in the left  删除换行 testicular vein.\n\n【72】Varicocele increases 删除换行 temperature in the scrotum and this seriously depresses  删除换行 spermatogenesis. To react to the rise of temperature on  删除换行 the left side of the scrotum, the dartos relaxes and the  删除换行 left side scrotum elongates in a natural attempt to  删除换行 overcome the rise of temperature. So left side of the  删除换行 scrotum hangs down.\n\n【73】CORD.—\n\n【74】HISTORY.— It is more commonly seen in young  删除换行 adults. Tall, thin men with pendulous scrota are  删除换行 frequently affected. Short, fat individuals are hardly 删除换行 affected.\n\n【75】SYMPTOMS.— (i) This condition does not often  删除换行 cause symptoms and in fact in 1 /4th of the individuals  删除换行 symptomless varicoceles do exist.\n\n【76】(ii) Vague and dragging discomfort is the most  删除换行 frequent symptom. This symptom gets worse when the  删除换行 scrotum is unsupported by underwear. Pain becomes  删除换行 worse on prolonged standing or exertion.\n\n【77】(iii) Very occasionally a few patients may present with  删除换行 subfertility. Bilateral varicocele may cause this condition  删除换行 with oligospermia.\n\n【78】ECTOPIC TESTIS\n\n【79】This condition should always be examined in standing  删除换行 posture, as the varicocele disappears tuhen the patient lies 删除换行 down.\n\n【80】On inspection the scrotum on the affected side hangs  删除换行 lower than normal. Dilated and engorged veins may be  删除换行 obvious on inspection. Impulse on coughing may be no删除8：<u>￾</u>ticed in dilated veins if one becomes very watchful.\n\n【81】On palpation the varicose plexus feels like a ‘bag of 删除换行 worms’. Impulse on coughing is better palpated than  删除换行 inspected. But this is thrill-like and not expansile in nature  删除换行 as in case of a hernia. After occluding the superficial  删除换行 inguinal ring with a thumb if the patient is asked to stand  删除换行 up the varicocele fills from below. After lightly holding  删除换行 the varicocele between the thumb and the finger, the  删除换行 patient is instructed to bow down — this will minimise  删除换行 tension within the veins. This is known as bow sign.\n\n【82】When the patient lies down the varicocele is reduced  删除换行 and this provides an opportunity to palpate properly the  删除换行 underlying testis. It is usually normal in this condition. \n\n【83】Only in long-standing cases the concerned testis becomes  删除换行 smaller and softer than its fellow of the opposite side due  删除换行 to slight atrophy.\n\n【84】Besides the routine investigations as preoperative  删除换行 check up, one has to differentiate between primary and  删除换行 secondary (secondary to adenocarcinoma of left kidney) \n\n【85】varicocele. For the latter IVP, Ultrasound, CT Scan and \n\n【86】Selective Angiogram may be required.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The score of 3  删除换行 out of 10 indicates severe impairment of cognitive function. A thirty-point mini-mental state  删除换行 examination (MMSE) was performed and confirmed severe cognitive impairment. In this  删除换行 patient the diagnosis is dementia, with gradual decline in a number of higher centre cogni删除8：<u>￾</u>tive domains (language, orientation, calculation, memory).\n\n【23】Dementia needs to be distinguished from delirium and depression. Dementia is a progressive  删除换行 decline in mental ability affecting intellect, behaviour and personality. In delirium, patients  删除换行 are acutely confused, inattentive and often have visual hallucinations. Delirium is usually  删除换行 reversible once the underlying cause is addressed (commonly infection, dehydration, med删除8：<u>￾</u>ication and constipation). Patients with dementia are particularly vulnerable to delirium. \n\n【24】Depression may mimic dementia (pseudo-dementia), as it can cause severe retardation of  删除换行 cognitive, vocabulary and motor functions. Depressed patients may score poorly on the  删除换行 abbreviated mental state test if they are rushed. Pseudo-dementia from depression is revers删除8：<u>￾</u>ible with anti-depressant therapy.\n\n【25】Dementia is a syndrome that can be caused by many diseases. The commonest cause of  删除换行 dementia is Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Progressive neuronal damage in AD occurs due to the  删除换行 accumulation of beta amyloid peptide with the formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibril删除8：<u>￾</u>lary tangles. The cause is not known. AD often begins as subtle forgetfulness and progresses  删除换行 over time such that patients lose their short-term memory, vocabulary, orientation. Later,  删除换行 long-term memory maybe lost, with an inability to remember relatives’ names or perform  删除换行 everyday tasks. In the latter stages of AD, patients may not attend to personal hygiene, diet or  删除换行 liquid intake. The average time of death from diagnosis is 7 years.\n\n【26】!

In the early 1800s, French surgeons described and advocated advancement flaps under the term “lambeau par glissement” (sliding flaps) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Since then these flaps have become widely used to close skin defects, especially those of the forehead.\n\n【15】The forehead is a large and highly expressive and dynamic cosmetic unit. Most forehead defects that cannot be closed primarily are reconstructed with laterally based advancement flaps 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. As with any cutaneous defect, options for closure include secondary intention (no closure), primary closure, skin grafting and rearranging adjacent tissue as a random cutaneous flap. Of course tissue expansion works well but not only does this need two stages, but it is inconvenient for a patient to be walking around with the noticeable bulge of a tissue expander under the skin of his forehead. Rotation flaps work very well on the scalp as we have discussed, but given their scar-line runs across forehead crease lines, they offer a poor choice for reconstruction of forehead defects. Skin grafts are routinely performed by many plastic surgeons for mid-forehead defects. However, in my opinion, skin grafts are a poor choice for the middle of the forehead, as they tend to leave a very noticeable color mismatch.\n\n【16】It is extremely common to use advancement flaps on the forehead, as their incision lines can be hidden among forehead wrinkles. For larger defects, bilateral advancement flaps are useful and for lateral forehead and temporal defects, transposition flaps are often used 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Within the dermis there are two distinct vascular arcades: a superficial vascular plexus that runs between the reticular and papillary dermis, and a more robust deep vascular plexus or “subdermal” plexus that runs between the reticular dermis and subcutaneous tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. As the advancement flaps become longer to close larger defects, it is important that the dissection is progressively deepened towards the base of the flap to ensure supply from the larger-bore vessels.\n\n【17】Advancement flaps depend on the advancement of the surrounding tissue along a linear axis to close a defect . The advancement of two skin edges from a fusiform skin excision represents the simplest of advancement flap design 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Classically, advancement flaps have a length-to-width ratio of 1:1 or 2:1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u> – and going beyond 3:1 may lead to flap necrosis.\n删除3：<u>Figure 5.1\n\n【18】( a ) H-advancement flap design. ( b ) Advancement flap illustration\n</u>\nAdvancement flaps are reliant on a random pattern blood supply, which comes from the anastomoses within the subdermal or dermal plexus. The perfusion pressure of feeding vessels and intravascular resistance determines the viable length of an advancement flap. In well-vascularized areas such as the forehead and scalp, it is possible to sometimes go beyond the 3:1 length-to-width ratio.\n\n【19】However, closure of very large >5 cm defects can pose a great challenge for the cutaneous surgeon. Reconstruction of the forehead using bilateral advancement ‘H’ flaps is discussed here, with my preferred method of increasing tissue mobility by utilizing the concept of sub-periosteal undermining. In this context, the relevant anatomy of advancement flaps, the underlying structures of the forehead, dissection techniques and a review of advancement flaps is undertaken.\n\n【20】Case Studies\n\n【21】1.\n\n【22】A 36 year old Chinese gentleman presented with a large 5 cm squamous cell cancer on his forehead. Firstly the diagnosis was unusual for his skin type, especially given his age. This further posed a reconstructive conundrum – if the flap involved the lower forehead, it would pull his eyebrows closer together. Obviously, a lesion of this size could not be closed primarily. I decided to use a double-advancement flap with one of the incisions extending onto the frontal hairline. This minimizes the visible scar on the forehead. I have found this useful forehead in patients with few wrinkles on the forehead, as if often the case in young Asians. Secondly, dissection was proceeded in the sub-periosteal plane in the temporal scalp to gain further mobility of the skin flaps and to achieve primary closure .\n删除3：<u>Figure 5.2\n\n【23】SCC forehead and plan of advancement flaps\n</u>删除3：<u>Figure 5.3\n\n【24】Advancement flaps sutured in place\n</u>\n2.\n\n【25】An 80-year old gentleman presented with a large 5 cm deeply infiltrating BCC of his central forehead. The simplest choice here may have been a skin graft but this would leave him with an area of de-pigmentation on his central forehead. Planning a double-advancement flap in this case isn’t easy – because when faced with a lesion of this size, mobilizing flaps would move the eyebrows closer. This is where the technique of sub-periosteal undermining in the temporal region proves effective in gaining valuable inches of skin. For a start, sub-periosteal dissection spares the temporal blood vessels which are liable to get damaged during superficial dissections. Further there is also concern of damage to the facial nerve branch if one was to proceed the discussion over the upper zygomatic region. Inferior to the zygomatic arch, the facial nerve branches travel below the SMAS layer and innervate the muscles of facial expression via the underside of the muscles. With standard double advancement flaps and utilizing sub-periosteal undermining, primary closure was achieved easily while ensuring the safety of vital structures .\n删除3：<u>Figure 5.4\n\n【26】Large infiltrating BCC central forehead\n</u>删除3：<u>Figure 5.5\n\n【27】Bilateral advancement flaps sutured in place\n</u>\nDiscussion\n----------\n\n【28】Double opposing ‘H’ flaps offer a high degree of patient satisfaction when planned well and can be used for defects up to 6 cm in diameter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. While planning any large flaps (or indeed any flap), it is preferable to achieve margin control i.e. ensure that the tumor has been excised completely. As discussed earlier, the H-flap is essentially two rectangular flaps that are advancement from opposing sides to close the defect. Ebrahimi and colleagues reserve this flap for tumors in upper middle or lateral portion of the forehead, defect size between 4 cm and 6 cm, no bone involvement, and patients with no history of radiotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. When one of the limbs of the flap is hidden in the hairline (as we have done in “ Case study 1. ”) it allows for a superior end result.\n\n【29】However, when dissection proceeds over the temporal scalp and temporal region, typically it becomes more difficult to achieve flap mobility. Psillakis and others described the technique of sub-periosteal dissection while performing facelifts as open non-endoscopic procedures. The thinking was that as the SMAS was firmly attached to the periosteum through the facial muscles, this technique improved mobility of the cheek and temple 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】In the temporal region, the dissection is deepened to expose the deep temporalis fascia. The loose areolar issue that forms the plane between the superficial and deep fascia in the temporal region allows for easy dissection down to the sub-periosteal plane, which is then raised using tissue elevators. The lateral extent of this sub-periosteal dissection is marked to ensure no damage to the branches of the facial nerve 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Dissecting in the sub-periosteal plane avoids branches of the supraorbital and supratrochlear vessels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Revascularisation in the sub-periosteal plane is rapid, as early as 4 days according to several authors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. However, I would stress that I only resort to sub-periosteal dissection when the defects are greater than 5 cm and it is obvious that closure of the advancement flaps is not possible in the conventional fashion. In other cases of scalp dissection, the sub-galeal plane is both easier and is adequate. There have been some concerns raised by some authors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u> about the possibility of sub-periosteal dissection affecting the regenerative capacity of the calvarium, even though the technique does help close these large defects. This is after all a method that has been borrowed from techniques honed by years of facelift anatomical research. Periosteal elevation causes an increase in overall cell counts during wound healing as well as cortical abnormalities. Dissection in the sub-galeal plane preserves the important bone–periosteal interface and seems to elicit less vigorous wound healing response both cellularly and vascularly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. While more histological research is needed, the technique of sub-periosteal elevation does offer major advantages in helping us close very large defects of the forehead with less eyebrow and vital structure distortion (than would be the case otherwise).\n\n【31】Any patient with a large forehead defect >5 cm needs a careful assessment and a radiological examination to ensure no bone involvement by the tumor being removed. Given these large double advancement flaps are still random pattern flaps, they are avoided in smokers and those with a history of radiotherapy. While dealing with large central forehead defects and the need to preserve eyebrow position, several authors have proposed the one-stage combination of advancement of a lateral U-shaped flap and a median forehead rotation flap – for reconstruction of large defects in the paramedian and lateral forehead 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. However, techniques such as these result in scars across wrinkle lines and therefore the technique of double opposed rectangular flaps we have advocated here achieves superior results. When reconstructing the lateral or middle parts of the forehead, it is important to maintain symmetry of the hairline and eyebrows. However, it is equally important to preserve the motor and sensory function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. It is especially important to note the anatomy of the facial nerve as it crosses the zygomatic arch. The temporal branch courses between the deep and superficial lobes of the parotid gland, then divides into multiple rami below the arch. It lies deep to the SMAS and superficial to the periosteum of the arch . The temporal branch then courses superiorly in close approximation with the superficial layer of temporal fascia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. When sub-periosteal dissection is done medially for cosmetic surgery endoscopic assistance is used. This is not needed at the lateral forehead and temporal region and easily performed using a small flat elevator to initiate the dissection and a larger flat elevator to free up a broader area of periosteum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Typically the advancement flap raised is anchored to the temporalis fascia to prevent any lateral ‘recoil’ post-operatively.\n\n【32】I concur with the opinion of other authors that the H-flap (or the double opposing rectangular advancement flap) is the preferred aesthetic flap for large upper forehead defects in central or lateral parts of forehead because direction of bilateral advancement is parallel to RSTLs and another advantage is upper border of flap is situated in the hairline and not visible 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. I have found this approach extremely useful in closing large defects of sizes approximating 5–6 cm of the forehead.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Moreover, she has 2 first-degree relatives with breast, ovarian, or both cancers prior to menopause. This makes _BRCA_ gene mutation likely. _BRCA1_ resides on chromosome 17. This gene encodes a protein that most likely is important in DNA repair. Thus, a mutation of the _BRCA_ 1 gene likely leads to abnormal cells propagating unchecked. A woman with a _BRCA1_ mutation has a 70% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer, and a 30%-40% risk of ovarian cancer. The vast majority of breast cancer is not genetically based, but occurs sporadically. However, familial-based breast cancers are most common because of _BRCA1_ mutation. _BRCA2_ is another mutation that is more commonly associated with male breast cancer. Other genetic mechanisms of cancer include oncogenes, which are abnormal genes that cause cancer usually by mutations. Proto-oncogenes are normal genes that are present in normal cells and involved in normal growth and development, but if mutations occur, they may become oncogenes.\n\n【12】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【13】#### Oncogenes\n\n【14】### OBJECTIVES\n\n【15】1\\. Know the definitions of oncogenes and proto-oncogenes.\n\n【16】2\\. Understand the role of promoter and repressor functions of DNA synthesis.\n\n【17】3\\. Know the normal DNA replication.\n\n【18】4\\. Be familiar with DNA mutations (point mutations, insertions, deletions).\n\n【19】5\\. Know the process of DNA repair.\n\n【20】6\\. Understand the recombination and transposition of genes.\n\n【21】### DEFINITIONS\n\n【22】OKAZAKI FRAGMENT: Short segments of DNA (approximately 1000 nucleotides in prokaryotes, 100-200 nucleotides in eukaryotes) synthesized on the lagging strand during DNA replication. As the replication fork opens, the RNA polymerase primase synthesizes a short RNA primer, which is extended by DNA polymerase until it reaches the preceding Okazaki fragment. The RNA primer on the previous Okazaki fragment is removed, the gap filled in with DNA and the strands ligated.\n\n【23】ONCOGENE: Genes whose products are involved in the transformation of normal cells to tumor cells. Most oncogenes are mutant forms of normal genes (proto-oncogenes).\n\n【24】PRIMASE: An RNA polymerase that synthesizes a short RNA primer complementary to a DNA template strand that is being replicated. This RNA primer serves as the starting point for addition of nucleotides in the replication of the strand serving as a template.\n\n【25】RECOMBINATION: Any process in which DNA strands are cleaved and rejoined resulting in an exchange of material between molecules of DNA.\n\n【26】TUMOR SUPPRESSOR GENES: Genes that encode for proteins that normally inhibit the progress of a cell through the cell cycle. If these genes are mutated, a deficiency in the suppressor proteins creates unregulated cell growth, a condition permissive for tumorigenesis.\n\n【27】### DISCUSSION\n\n【28】DNA replication normally occurs during the S phase of the cell cycle. DNA replication occurs in a semiconservative fashion and this is because of the intrinsic antiparallel nature of the double helix. All known DNA polymerases synthesize DNA in a 5 ′ to 3 ′ direction; this means that 1 strand will be continuously synthesized and the other must be made through a discontinuous mechanism and the production of Okazaki fragments. After this process is finished, the cell will divide the newly replicated material in mitosis. In some aberrant cases, the cell will replicate its DNA over and over again without performing an intervening mitosis. This generates cells with abnormally high content of DNA, an abnormal form of DNA replication control.\n\n【29】DNA replication begins by separating the parental DNA strands. This is accomplished by enzymes called helicases. They separate the strands and move along the strands in a fixed direction at the expense of ATP, opening up the strands so that the DNA polymerases can bind to them. To prevent reannealing of the 2 strands, single-stranded binding proteins bind the 2 complementary strands. The next step in the replication process is the laying down of an RNA primer, which is catalyzed by the enzyme primase. DNA polymerases extend the chain by adding deoxyribonucleotides to the 5 ′ end of the RNA primer. It does this in a continuous fashion on the leading strand, but for the lagging strand, the 1 with its 5 ′ end toward the replication fork, a series of short segments termed Okazaki fragments must be synthesized. The RNA primers of the Okazaki fragments are removed as the DNA polymerase reaches the previous Okazaki fragment and the DNA segments are then joined by DNA ligase.\n\n【30】DNA mutations arise from a variety of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Our genome is constantly under the assault of various genotoxic agents such as ionizing radiation, oxygen free radicals, and UV light. These agents serve to introduce DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) as well as thymine–thymine dimers into the DNA. DSBs may generate deletion or insertion mutations and could alter the reading frame of the genetic code, an event that can easily lead to the malfunction of a protein. Ultraviolet (UV)-induced dimers may generate point mutations that also alter the reading frame.\n\n【31】To respond to the various forms of DNA damage, cells have evolved a host of DNA repair mechanisms that serve to restore the genetic material. Depending on the nature of the DNA damage (eg, DSB vs UV-induced thymine dimers), the cell will invoke a different mechanism of repair. In addition, the stage of the cell cycle at which the lesion is detected and processed can activate independent DNA repair pathways. For example, if a daughter chromatid template is present in S or G <sub>2 </sub> phase of the cell cycle, the cell will use this unperturbed partner molecule to fix a DSB. This process is referred to as homologous recombination (HR) and represents a major branch of the DNA repair process. However, if the damage occurs during the G <sub>1 </sub> phase of the cell cycle, a period devoid of an existing chromatid template that can be used for repair, a general end joining process will be used. This process, referred to as nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), ligates the broken ends together with little to no regard for the loss of intervening sequences. Therefore, NHEJ is considered an error prone process, but given the large size of the genome and the presence of many forms of “junk DNA,” the NHEJ process may not necessarily disrupt DNA sequences that encode proteins. By contrast to NHEJ, HR is a process that is error fre e by virtue of the fact that the daughter chromatid is used as a template for repair.\n\n【32】Recombination and transposition of genes are 2 processes that mutate the genetic material. As discussed above, recombination is integral to the process of DNA repair. When DNA recombination is impaired through mutation of specific genes (like _BRCA1_ or _Rad51_ ), aberrant recombination takes place, generating abnormal chromosomes that possess translocations from 2 or more chromosomes. Translocations transpose genes from one chromosomal environment to another and often this leads to a disruption in gene expression. Such events are known to cause gene amplification, a phenomenon often associated with cancer. They may also generate chromosomes that possess 2 centromeres (dicentrics), leading to a variety of cellular defects in mitosis.\n\n【33】DNA replication is tightly controlled by a variety of proteins that act to promote the process (ie, DNA polymerases and _cis_ \\-acting elements that bind to DNA and recruit factors involved in the process) as well as ones that inhibit the synthesis of DNA, either directly or indirectly. One factor that indirectly inhibits DNA synthesis is the p53 tumor suppressor. Tumor suppressors refer to a general class of proteins that function to slow and alter cell growth and development through a variety of mechanisms. In the absence of these factors, cells will have a reduced capacity to perform a variety of functions essential to maintain genomic stability. The p53 functions to control the G <sub>1 </sub> S boundary of the cell cycle, and if the cell is not prepared to enter S phase, then DNA synthesis will be negatively regulated.\n\n【34】A major cause of familial breast cancer results from mutation in the breast cancer susceptibility gene, _BRCA1_ . Originally identified in 1994, it was not until 1997 when David Livingston and colleagues demonstrated that _BRCA1_ is a nuclear protein that its function began to be understood. They found that after treatment of cells with agents known to generate DNA damage (ie, hydroxyurea, UV light, ionizing radiation), _BRCA1_ was found to localize to discrete nuclear structures typically called _foci_ . Such foci are known to correlate with sites of DNA damage or the sites of stalled replication forks in S phase of the cell cycle. In addition to the striking nuclear localization of _BRCA1_ in response to DNA damaging agents, it was also observed that the BRCA1 protein was phosphorylated in response to these agents. Given this and the wealth of data obtained from studying the cell cycle in yeast model systems, it was concluded that _BRCA1_ functioned as a cell cycle regulator in response to DNA damage.\n\n【35】Further studies have implicated _BRCA1_ in the cellular response to DNA DSBs, a potentially lethal form of DNA damage. Cells defective in _BRCA1_ possess numerous cytological and biologic features that have been known for years to be correlated with perturbation in the maintenance of chromosome stability. This includes aneuploidy, centrosome amplification, spontaneous chromosome breakage, aberrant recombination events, sensitivity to ionizing radiation, and impaired cell cycle checkpoints. In addition, a variety of experiments have demonstrated roles for _BRCA1_ in enforcing the G <sub>2 </sub> /M cell cycle transition, homologous recombination between sister chromatids, as well as the restart of stalled replication in S phase.\n\n【36】The _BRCA1_ tumor suppressor interacts with numerous cellular proteins in large complexes. This includes a variety of proteins implicated in various DNA repair and cell cycle processes. In fact, _BRCA1_ has been reported to interact with as many as 50 proteins. Moreover, _BRCA1_ has been shown to function in various transcriptional mechanisms, suggesting that the function of this important protein may go well beyond its well-documented role in DSB repair. How the inactivation of _BRCA1_ , a gene that appears to operate in DNA repair pathways that appear generic to various cell types and predisposes women to inherited forms of breast cancer, remains a mystery and the subject of much debate. Given that _BRCA1_ appears to have key roles in transcriptional regulation, it has been suggested that _BRCA1_ could influence mammary tissue through pathways that impinge on the biology of estrogen and estrogen-related metabolites. In addition, it has been suggested that breast tissue differs from other tissues in the types of DNA repair processes that are used. Perhaps there are redundant DNA repair pathways in nonmammary tissue. In any event, the complex behavior of _BRCA1_ promises to challenge future researchers as they search for the underlying mechanisms that initiate familial breast cancer.\n\n【37】###", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

She reports generalized weakness and occasional bouts of nausea and vomiting. Her blood pressure is 160/99 mm Hg. Laboratory studies show a serum potassium level of 2.2 mEq/L. She is diagnosed with a condition that affects the production of two of the three major adrenal hormones, leaving only one functioning hormone. In which area of the adrenal gland is this one functioning hormone produced?\n\n【1】> (A) Capsule\n\n【2】> (B) Medulla\n\n【3】> (C) Zona fasciculata\n\n【4】> (D) Zona glomerulosa\n\n【5】> (E) Zona reticularis\n\n【6】 **Answer**: The correct answer is D . 17α-Hydroxylase deficiency, a form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, is characterized by deficits in glucocorticoid and sex steroid synthesis. This is coupled with increased mineralocorticoid (aldosterone) production due to the shunting of precursors, such as pregnenolone and progesterone, through mineralocorticoid pathways. The increased levels of aldosterone lead to increased sodium retention and potassium excretion (hence, the patient’s hypertension and hypokalemia). The low sex steroid levels manifest clinically as a female phenotype with no sexual maturation. Aldosterone is produced in the zona glomerulosa. Aldosterone synthesis requires 21β-hydroxylase but not 17α-hydroxylase. Remember the mnemonic “ S alt, S ugar, and S ex” for the layers of the adrenal cortex and their respective products, with “salt” corresponding to the outer zona glomerulosa, “sugar” corresponding to the middle zona fasciculata, and “sex” corresponding to the inner zona reticularis. 11β-Hydroxylase deficiency is another form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia and causes decreased cortisol, aldosterone, and corticosterone production and excess production of sex hormones and 11-deoxycorticosterone. The symptoms are similar to those of 17α-hydroxylase deficiency, manifesting as hypertension and hypokalemia; however, virilization would also be present.  \n\n【7】Answer A is incorrect . The capsule does not produce any hormones.  \n\n【8】Answer B is incorrect . The medulla produces catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine); neither 17α-hydroxylase nor 21β-hydroxylase is required for the synthesis of catecholamines.  \n\n【9】Answer C is incorrect . Cortisol is produced in the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex. Cortisol synthesis requires 21β-hydroxylase and 17α-hydroxylase and is therefore deficient in this patient.  \n\n【10】Answer E is incorrect . Sex hormones are produced in the zona reticularis. Synthesis of the sex hormones requires 17α-hydroxylase, but not 21β-hydroxylase, and is therefore deficient in this patient, leading to her primary amenorrhea. 11β-Hydroxylase deficiency is another form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and causes decreased cortisol, aldosterone, and corticosterone production and excess production of sex hormones and 11-deoxycorticosterone.

Prolonged QT syndrome is associated with sudden death， especially in young athletes. Mild bradycardia alone in a young， healthy patient who has fully recovered from an episode of syncope is of little concern. P-wave inversion in lead aVR is a normal finding. Sinus arrhythmia is a normal variation in the RR interval with respiration.\n\n【23】15.4 C. Obtain an ECG. This patient has a high probability for a cardiac cause of his syncope. Initial management includes placing the patient on a cardiac monitor and obtaining an ECG to monitor for dysrhythmias. A head CT scan should be performed after an ECG is obtained. A carotid duplex ultrasound and chest radiograph may aid in the workup for syncope， but it is most impor-tant to first rule out a dysrhythmia.\n\n【24】**CLINICAL PEARLS**\n\n【25】The primary goal of the EP in the evaluation of patients with syncope is to be able to identify those who are at high risk for morbidity and mortality.\n\n【26】The causes of syncope are varied， and a successful diagnosis hinges on diligent history collection and appropriate use of diagnostic tools.\n\n【27】Even the most experienced clinician will be unable to determine the cause of syncope in up to 50% of patients.\n\n【28】Reassuring clinical signs in syncope are youth， a normal ECG， absence of comorbidities， and reassuring historical features.\n\n【29】Unstable patients should be treated emergently and stabilized， first addressing the ABCs.\n\n【30】**", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

She should be adequately assessed in the \n\n【10】Emergency Department and managed accordingly.\n\n【11】Fever is a very common presentation in the Emergency Department, and in the immuno删除8：<u>￾</u>competent child is usually caused by a simple infection (usually viral or bacterial) with com删除8：<u>￾</u>mon sources being the chest, urine, ear, nose or throat. Diagnosis is mostly based on clinical  删除换行 history and examination, but in some cases, no obvious focus can be identified.\n\n【12】Other causes of fever may include less common infections such as parasitic infections, malig删除8：<u>￾</u>nancy such as solid tumours and leukaemia, vascular and autoimmune diseases such as juve删除8：<u>￾</u>nile arthritis and Kawasaki disease and other conditions such as Familial Mediterranean \n\n【13】Fever.\n\n【14】On assessment, it is important to look for concerning features. Tachycardia is a particular  删除换行 feature that should not be ignored, especially if the patient remains tachycardic after the use  删除换行 of anti-pyretics. This immediately places the child in a higher-risk group for serious illness.\n\n【15】The following clinical features are also red-flag signs for serious illness:\n\n【16】• Grunting, tachypneoa or other signs of respiratory distress\n\n【17】• Mottled, pale skin with cool peripheries and prolonged capillary refill time\n\n【18】• Irritability, with a high-pitched cry, and if the child is not responding to social cues\n\n【19】• Difficulty to rouse or a bulging fontanelle\n\n【20】• An ‘ill’-looking child\n\n【21】In the above case, no obvious source of infection was found on examination. The patient  删除换行 should be considered for a septic screen including blood tests (capillary blood gas, full blood  删除换行 count, renal function, liver function, C-reactive protein and blood cultures), urinalysis and  删除换行 culture. A chest radiograph is recommended if the white cell count is >20 × 109\n\n【22】/L. A lumbar  删除换行 puncture should also be considered to exclude meningitis if no immediate source is found as  删除换行 per current NICE guidelines for children under 1 year of age.\n\n【23】Children with pyrexia of unknown origin should be referred to the paediatric team for  删除换行 admission, observation and further investigation and treatment as necessary. Pitfalls in the \n\n【24】ED include the failure to realise the severity of illness in the early stages (capillary blood gas  删除换行 testing is a quick way to assess for severe metabolic insult).\n\n【25】After taking the relevant cultures for microbiolical analysis, the use of early parenteral anti删除8：<u>￾</u>biotic treatment should be considered in unwell or toxic children, and most hospitals will  删除换行 have specific antibiotic protocols for empiric treatment stratified by age.

LCH is characterized by the pathologic proliferation and excessive accumulation in a variety of organs with Langerhans cells that normally derived from epidermal and mucosal dendritic cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. The disease can be localized in a single organ or multi-organs involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】LCH has traditionally been described as four separate syndromes with different clinical severity : Hashimoto-Pritzker disease , Eosinophilic granuloma, Hand-Schüller-Christian disease and Letterer-Siwe disease . Currently, LCH patients are generally categorized as single system LCH (SS-LCH) and multi-system LCH (MS-LCH) . MS-LCH can be categorized as high-risk type LCH and low-risk type LCH based on whether the organs at risk, including liver, spleen and bone marrow, are involved. The clinical severity of LCH ranges from benign skin lesions to invasive multi-organ disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【27】Pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta (PLEVA) is believed to be an inflammatory reaction caused by certain infective factors or secondary to T cell clonal proliferative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Clinical manifestations are multiple erythematous ulcerative necrotic lesions, which usually occur on the flexural side of extremities and the trunk. Scaly papules usually have a central punctum and develop into small vesicular with hemorrhagic necrosis, ulcers, and brown scabs, often leaving varioliformis scarring. Histologic analysis shows parakeratosis, basal layer vacuolization, extravasation of lymphocytes and erythrocytes extending into the epidermis, perivascular lymphocytic and histiocytic infiltration in the dermis. Immunohistochemistry reveals that the infiltrating cells are mainly CD3 <sup>+ </sup> and CD8 <sup>+ </sup> T lymphocytes.\n\n【28】Lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP) is a non-aggressive skin disorder with a tendency to self-regression. LyP is characterized by a variety of clinical features with solitary or aggregated papules and nodules, accompanied by central hemorrhage, necrosis and crusts, half of which remain superficial atrophic scars after healing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. There are five typical histopathologic subtypes of LyP: A, B, C, D and E, which vary according to the predominant cell type and tropism. The most common form is type A, which demonstrates the wedge-shaped dermal cellular infiltrate containing large anaplastic cells, plasma cells, pleomorphic lymphocytes and histiocytes. Immunohistochemistry shows CD30 expression in large anaplastic or pleomorphic lymphoid cells.\n\n【29】Treatment strategies of LCH depend on the site, extent and severity of the disease. In the cases of single lesion, topical steroids, surgical excision, thalidomide, methotrexate and phototherapy have all been used. Combined chemotherapy is recommended in a diffuse multi systemic disease or when disease relapses or progresses. Recently, BRAF V600E mutations has been found in nearly half of LCH cases, which is a significant implications for both molecular diagnostics and targeted therapies using specific BRAF oncogenic kinase inhibitors such as vemurafenib or dabrafenib , especially for refractory and relapsed cases.\n\n【30】Considering the age and severity of the disease, we prescribed topical corticosteroids, twice per day, and moisturizers to the patient. After 2 weeks treatment, the pruritus and scaling papules lesions improved obviously. Full blood count, internal organs’ function, growth and development were all in normal ranges without life-threatening complications during the 6-month follow-up.\n\n【31】Key Points\n\n【32】*   Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is regarded as a heterogeneous disease, with remarkably diverse clinical spectrum, ranging from isolated skin or bone lesions to a diffuse disease that can affect nearly any organ.\n\n【33】*   Histopathologically, LCH is characterized by diffuse infiltrate of heteromorphic histocytes with reniform nuclei, fine chromatin and abundant pale eosinophilic cytoplasm, accompanied by large eosinophils.\n\n【34】*   LCH is currently categorized as single system LCH (SS-LCH) and multi-system LCH (MS-LCH) by extent of single or multiple systems involvement and the presence of risk organ involvement.

On examination, she is noted to have edema and tenderness of the left submandibular region. Palpation of her mouth reveals a 4-mm, irregular, nonmobile, hard mass in the mucosa of her mouth. She denies trauma to the region and does not have an eating disorder.\n\n【3】 What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【4】 What is the anatomical course of the affected structure?\n\n【5】### ANSWER TO CASE 45 :\n\n【6】#### Salivary Stone\n\n【7】_Summary:_ A 36-year-old woman complains of pain and swelling of the left submandibular area. On examination, she has tenderness of the left submandibular salivary gland and a palpable, irregular, 4-mm mass along the floor of her mouth. She denies trauma to the region and does not have an eating disorder.\n\n【8】• Most likely diagnosis: Stone in the submandibular duct (sialolithiasis).\n\n【9】• Anatomical course of the affected structure: The submandibular salivary duct drains from the deep lobe of the submandibular gland and courses anterolaterally along the base of the tongue. Occlusion of the duct by a stone will cause secreted saliva to accumulate proximally to the stone, thus causing distention and pain.\n\n【10】### CLINICAL CORRELATION\n\n【11】This 36-year-old woman has sudden onset of pain to the left submandibular area. The pain is most intense after a meal. She also complains of a “sandlike” or “gritty” sensation in her mouth. The left submandibular gland appears swollen. This is most consistent with a stone in the submandibular duct. Pain after a meal is due to the accumulation of saliva proximal to the occluded duct, which stretches the duct or the capsule of the gland. Generalized swelling may be due to a secondary infection. The pathogenesis of sialolithiasis is unknown but appears to be due to lodging of a small particle in the duct, which serves as a nucleus for deposition of organic and inorganic material. The particle could be food, bacteria, or an inorganic constituent of tobacco smoke. The next diagnostic step would be examination with sialoendoscopy. Treatment would be excision of the stone under endoscopy and administration of antibiotics. If necessary, the gland would be removed surgically.\n\n【12】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【13】#### Salivary Glands\n\n【14】### OBJECTIVES\n\n【15】1\\. Be able to describe the salivary glands and the course of their ducts to the oral cavity\n\n【16】2\\. Be able to identify structures in the floor of the mouth related to the submandibular gland\n\n【17】### DEFINITIONS\n\n【18】CARUNCLE: Small protuberance, or papilla\n\n【19】FRENULUM: Mucosal fold that extends along the midline from the floor of the mouth to the inferior surface of the tongue\n\n【20】### DISCUSSION\n\n【21】Three salivary glands form an irregular, space-filling ring around the oral cavity . The parotid gland lies superficial and posterior to the ramus of the mandible and inferior to the ear. The submandibular gland lies below the angle and the body of the mandible superficial to the mylohyoid muscle. The sublingual gland lies in the floor of the mouth between the mandible and the genioglossus muscle. All of the glands secrete saliva into the oral cavity through characteristic ducts. The parotid duct emerges from the anterior border of the parotid gland. The parotid duct crosses over the masseter muscle and pierces through the buccinator muscle to open into the oral cavity, typically at the level of the second upper molar. The submandibular duct forms from the deep lobe of the submandibular gland, deep to the mylohyoid muscle. The duct runs anteriorly on the surface of the hyoglossus muscle and opens into the oral cavity through the submandibular caruncles, just lateral to the lingual frenulum. The sublingual glands give rise to numerous small ducts that empty at the base of the tongue.\n删除3：<u>Figure 45-1. The large salivary glands. ( _Reproduced, with permission, from Lindner HH. Clinical Anatomy. East Norwalk, CT: Appleton & Lange, 1989:60_ .)</u>\n\n【22】The submandibular duct has a close relation to several important structures in the floor of the mouth. The submandibular gland folds around the free posterior border of the mylohyoid muscle , and the duct arises from the deep lobe of the gland. It courses anteriorly between the mylohyoid and hyoglossus muscles and then on the deep surface of the sublingual gland. The hypoglossal nerve (CN XII) courses inferior to the submandibular duct to enter the inferior surface of the genioglossus muscle. The lingual nerve descends on the surface of the medial pterygoid muscle and loops underneath the duct before innervating the anterior portion of the tongue.\n\n【23】###", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Her immunosuppression consists ofbasiliximab (anti-interleukin-2)， prednisone， mycophenolate， and tacrolimus. Blood cultures and viraltiters including cytomegalovirus (CMV) are pending.  |\n| --- |\n| What is cross-matching? In transplantation， the process of cross-matching determines whether the recipient has antibodies to thedonor's WBCs. This measure prevents hyper acute rejection due to preformed antibodies.  |\n| If CMV is present， what fraction of a blood sample will have the highest yield for the virus?Because CMV invades WBCs， these cells contain the highest titer of the virus. Upon centrifuging a bloodsample， a \"buffy coat，\" representing< 1% of blood and seen between the plasma and hematocrit， willseparate out most of the WBCs and platelets. Figure 12-11 shows a CMV giant cell with multiple hyaline inclusions. OACE FIGURE 12-11. Photomicrograph of CMV. (Reproduced， with permission， fromLe T， et al. First Aid for the USMLE Step 1：2008.

The girl is immunosuppressed， and there is a significant probability that she has been exposed to CMVApproximately 80% of normal adults are infected with CMV yet remain asymptomatic because of theirfunctional immune systems. Therefore， there is a high likelihood that the donor may have been CMV positive.As with other members of the herpes virus family， CMV is more likely to activate in an immunosuppressedhost. In the immunocompromised host CMV can cause a variety of syndromes， including a mildly febrileupper respiratory illness， severe gastrointestinal syndrome with mild hepatitis， marked pancytopenia， orpneumonitis. CMV can also directly cause graft dysfunction.  |\n| What is the mechanism of action of ganciclovir against CMV?Ganciclovir is a guanosine derivative that inhibits CMV DNA polymerase. The most common side effectsof ganciclovir are hematologic thrombocytopenia (57%) and leukopenia (41%).  |\n| How does infection lead to fever in a normal individual?Pyrogenic cytokines released by phagocytic cells of the immune system trigger the release of cytokines，including tumor necrosis factor-0l and interleukin-1， which causes the hypothalamus to increase the setpoint of core body temperature. A key factor in the ability to mount a fever is the presence of an intactimmune system. Infection is often difficult to detect in patients with poor immune function， as their abilityto mount a fever is severely blunted.  |\n\n【2】Pyrogenic cytokines released by phagocytic cells of the immune system trigger the release of cytokines， including tumor necrosis factor-0l and interleukin-1， which causes the hypothalamus to increase the set point of core body temperature.

The platelet  删除换行 count is normal for pregnancy, though low for a non-pregnant person. Electrolytes are within  删除换行 the normal range but the creatinine is higher than normal for pregnancy. Alkaline phospha删除8：<u>￾</u>tase is always raised in pregnancy due to its production by the placenta. However the alanine  删除换行 transaminase is abnormal.\n\n【28】A normal urate value correlates with gestational age (the urate level should not be more than  删除换行 the number of weeks gestation) and therefore the level of 43 mmol/L is high. Finally, the 24 h  删除换行 urinary protein measurement, performed to quantify the degree of proteinuria, has shown a  删除换行 significantly raised result (>0.3 g/24 h).\n\n【29】This woman thus has pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) with proteinuria, abnormal  删除换行 liver function and raised serum creatinine and urate. This is known as pre-eclampsia. The  删除换行 condition commonly occurs in asymptomatic women and the severity of symptoms often  删除换行 does not correlate with the disease severity.\n\n【30】No further maternal investigations are needed but fetal wellbeing needs to be assessed by  删除换行 cardiotocograph and ultrasound assessment for fetal growth and liquor volume in view of the  删除换行 association between pre-eclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction.\n\n【31】Induction of labour as soon as possible is indicated, as the fetus is beyond 37 weeks and  删除换行 delay might increase the likelihood of fulminating pre-eclampsia in the mother or fetal  删除换行 compromise, including placental abruption. There is no indication for caesarean section  删除换行 unless induction is unsuccessful or fetal compromise occurs before or during labour. Close  删除换行 monitoring of blood pressure is imperative during and after labour, as many eclamptic fits  删除换行 occur postnatally.\n\n【32】In this case the woman agreed to induction of labour and started contracting after the first  删除换行 dose of intravaginal prostaglandin gel. The labour progressed rapidly with subsequent nor删除8：<u>￾</u>mal delivery. However the blood pressure increased in labour to 155/110 mmHg.

She said that the four residents had been having a small party to cel删除8：<u>￾</u>ebrate one of their birthdays. This man is not used to having alcohol and he had been drink删除8：<u>￾</u>ing wine. He was well before the party and was eating heartily until he said he felt unwell. He  删除换行 complained of feeling ‘bad’ and ‘sick’. He was also holding his head before he had the fit and  删除换行 said his head hurt. When she gave him a hug she said that she could feel his heart pounding. \n\n【3】She has not brought any files but says that she knows he has seen a psychiatrist regularly, and  删除换行 that she was told that until about 5 years ago he was on several different medications for a  删除换行 severe and prolonged depressive illness, but that he has been well so far as she knows for the  删除换行 last few years on medication. She does not give him his medication and is uncertain what it \n\n【4】is. She does not think he has epilepsy. It was not in her handover notes. His mother has died  删除换行 and distant relatives only visit very occasionally. Recently she says he has been happy, doing  删除换行 his usual activities, and there have been no concerns about him that she knows of. When you  删除换行 talk to the man himself he is alert but does not answer any of your questions. He holds his  删除换行 head and cries out occasionally.\n\n【5】Physical examination\n\n【6】On examination you are able to look at the man’s fundi and see no abnormalities and no  删除换行 papilloedema. His reflexes are equal although very slightly brisk bilaterally. His pulse is 100  删除换行 beats per minute and his blood pressure is 140/98 mm Hg.\n\n【7】Questions\n\n【8】• What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【9】• What further information do you need?\n\n【10】• What is the treatment?删除5：<u>272</u>\n删除7：<u>100 Cases in Psychiatry</u>\nANSWER 99\n\n【11】It is possible that this is a seizure in a man with learning disability. Given common pathways  删除换行 of neurological involvement a person with learning disability is more likely to have epilepsy  删除换行 than a person without (e.g. about 30% in classical autism). However given that he has no  删除换行 apparent history of epilepsy it would be unusual for this to start at age 45 unless he has some  删除换行 kind of neurodegenerative disorder, for which you have no evidence. It would be prudent  删除换行 therefore to consider alternative options.\n\n【12】Seizures may be a sign of an intracranial lesion, but you have found no focal neurologi删除8：<u>￾</u>cal signs or papilloedema. Alcohol intoxication can drop seizure thresholds. Consider the  删除换行 ‘Cheese Reaction’. The history suggests that he was well until he went to a party. Since then he  删除换行 has had headache, palpitations, high blood pressure and fitting, and the symptoms have come  删除换行 on since he has eaten (possibly cheese?) and drunk alcohol. The cheese reaction involves  删除换行 hypertensive crisis brought about by eating tyramine when on monoamine oxidase inhibi删除8：<u>￾</u>tors. This causes release of adrenaline. There is a risk of stroke if not treated and the crisis  删除换行 puts a significant load on the heart leading to increased risk of arrhythmias. This man’s blood  删除换行 pressure needs monitoring carefully and no active treatment is necessary while his diastolic  删除换行 blood pressure remains below 100 mm Hg. The treatment carries its own risks since drop删除8：<u>￾</u>ping the blood pressure quickly can cause hypoperfusion that can particularly affect the kid删除8：<u>￾</u>ney, brain and heart. This man should be admitted. Depending on the time when the cheese  删除换行 was ingested then oral captopril or clonidine may be considered. If blood pressure rises pre删除8：<u>￾</u>cipitously then intravenous sodium nitroprusside can be used but only under supervised  删除换行 conditions (e.g. in a coronary care unit).\n\n【13】Given that you do not know what medication this man is taking, you should also consider  删除换行 neuroleptic malignant syndrome . This involves pyrexia, fitting and autonomic  删除换行 instability. You might expect musculoskeletal stiffness from this and it is not present. This  删除换行 means it is urgent that you find out what this man’s medication is, as this will greatly sim删除8：<u>￾</u>plify the options. Make it a priority to find out. Ask the carer to contact someone who has  删除换行 access to accurate up-to-date records,  删除换行 or contact the duty care supervisor  删除换行 or general practitioner for the home. \n\n【14】Other possibilities include a panic  删除换行 attack but this would not cause fitting,  删除换行 although high states of anxiety can  删除换行 provoke pseudo-seizures. However,  删除换行 there is no evidence for recent high  删除换行 levels of stress.\n\n【15】After this episode it would be prudent  删除换行 to see if an alternative medication  删除换行 would be as effective for this man.\n\n【16】Food containing tyramine\n\n【17】• Things containing protein that have been  删除换行 aged include\n\n【18】• Cheese that has aged\n\n【19】• Matured meat\n\n【20】• Processed food\n\n【21】• Fermented soy products\n\n【22】• Dried fruit\n\n【23】• Avocado and aubergine (AA)\n\n【24】• Prunes, plums and pineapple (PPP)\n\n【25】• Figs, raisins, oranges and grapes (FROG)\n\n【26】Key Points\n\n【27】• People taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors can react badly to food containing  删除换行 tyramine (hypertensive crisis) or tryptophan (hyperserotinaemia).\n\n【28】• A good medication history can be crucial in helping you to plan treatment.删除5：<u>273</u>\nCase 100: Compulsive and aggressive behaviour in a man with Down syndrome", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

A routine physical examination of the child reveals a split S2 heart sound with an accentuated P2 component. The newborn has bounding pulses with a wide pulse pressure. After a week the newborn’s parents notice that he has developed shortness of breath and respiratory distress. What pathogen did the mother contract during her pregnancy that could explain the newborn’s current condition?\n\n【1】> (A) Cytomegalovirus\n\n【2】> (B) Herpes simplex virus 2\n\n【3】> (C) Rubivirus\n\n【4】> (D) _Toxoplasma gondii_\n\n【5】> (E) _Treponema pallidum_\n\n【6】 **Answer**: The correct answer is C. All five answers are part of ToRCHeS ( To xoplasmosis, R ubella, C ytomegalovirus, _H_ erpesvirus/HIV, and S yphilis) infections, the group of infections for which every newborn is tested. If the mother becomes infected during pregnancy, the pathogens can cross the placenta and infect the fetus. Rubivirus causes rubella in adults. The virus crosses the placenta in the first trimester and causes congenital abnormalities that range from deafness to cataracts to cardiovascular abnormalities. The abnormal heart exam findings in this newborn are classic for a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) with delayed symptoms of heart failure. A PDA is the most common cardiovascular abnormality seen in congenital rubella syndrome. A PDA results from the failure of the ductus arteriosus to close in the first days of life. This results in a left-to-right shunt from the aorta to the pulmonary artery. In a substantial shunt, deoxygenated blood returning from the body to the heart bypasses the lung via the PDA to the aorta. Because blood is shunted, there is a widening of pulse pressure (the difference between systolic and diastolic). A split S2 sound occurs in PDA because of the increased flow through the pulmonary artery. The S2 sound is a composite of two distinct heart valves. Normally, the aortic valve closes just before the pulmonary valve. When the pulmonary valve is forced to stay open longer than the aortic valve, such as “physiologic split” and, in this case, a large PDA, we hear the split S2 sound.  \n\n【7】Answer A is incorrect. Congenital CMV infection is marked most commonly by petechial rashes, jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, and sensorineural hearing loss. Cardiovascular abnormalities are not features of congenital CMV infection.  \n\n【8】Answer B is incorrect. Congenital herpes infection most often either affects skin, eyes, and mouth or presents as localized CNS infection. Symptoms usually develop within four weeks of birth. CNS symptoms can include temperature instability, respiratory distress, poor feeding, and lethargy. Herpes simplex virus type 2 is also one of the most common causes of neonatal encephalitis.  \n\n【9】Answer D is incorrect. Congenital toxoplasmosis infection most often is asymptomatic initially. The class triad of symptoms that develop include chorioretinitis, hydrocephalus, and intracranial calcifications. Early symptoms can include a maculopapular rash, jaundice, and hepatomegaly. Most complications develop if the infection is not treated soon after birth.  \n\n【10】Answer E is incorrect. Newborns with congenital syphilis normally are asymptomatic at birth. When symptoms develop, the babies often have hearing problems (based on cranial defect VIII) and cutaneous lesions that normally appear on the palms and soles first. More serious symptoms include anemia, jaundice, and hepatomegaly.

{"seq_id": "7e7f7518-8392-4f0a-8c30-5abb86aafcd7", "title": null, "text": "【0】The tumour was extensively visible on the surface and a location by stimulation was carried out once the patient had been wakened； the brain lesion had been revealed by epileptic fits that had been develop-ing since six months before the operation. The location by stimulation triggered some partial fits that were quickly stopped by iced serum； these affected the control of bodily movements： elbow-fist-hand flexing， fist-hand flexing， jaw movements， and so on. My colleague indicates 删除换行 some phonemic paraphasias； the excision of the tumour was carried out while taking account， according to the places， of some phonemic or semantic paraphasias. He approached the motor paths without touch-ing them， so as to avoid compounding the linguistic deficiency with a motor deficiency. After this brief account， I continue my search in the medical literature to deepen my knowledge.\n\n【1】This is a grade II glioma； the World Health Organization (WHO) clas-sification revised in 2007 is not straightforward to reproduce because it does not take into account the heterogeneity of tumours and makes no distinction between tumorous cells and infiltrated residual paren-chyma. The French Sainte-Anne classification has a better predictabil-ity， because it integrates clinical data and imagery by taking account of the results of the MRI investigation， which reveals the signs of necrosis and neo-vascularisation that are specific to high-grade tumours， but that does not apply in this case. Grade II tumours are called oligoden-droglial tumours； this is an oligoastrocytoma， which is a mixed tumour combining the characteristics of astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas. At La Pitie-Salpetriere， the INSERM teams， led by Jean-Yves Delattre and Denis Delattre at the Institut Curie， have identified several types of deletion on chromosome one that are related to good prognosis for some gliomas. As it is difficult to establish a correct grading in the clas-sification of gliomas， since it is essentially based on fine microscopic characteristics， I have preferred to omit them， for the time being， when predicting the psychosomatic risk in the development of this type of glioma.\n\n【2】In Chloe's case， the intervention was followed by severe aphasic problems that have since disappeared； the neurosurgeon also notes the relatively faint Germanic intonation. As mentioned above， Chloe is receiving treatment from a speech therapist.\n\n【3】Research into low-grade gliomas and brain plasticity gives me great hope for my patient's treatment； the dogma of Broca's localis-ing model has been challenged. For some years， new data from sur-gery have been demonstrating， increasingly clearly， that massive cerebral excisions can be completely compensated for， without leaving any discernible functional deficiency. Pre- and post-surgical imaging techniques， as well as peri-operative stimulation procedures， make it possible to follow the nature and kinetics of these compensations. In fact， well before the surgical operation， and in response to the tumor-ous invasion， the process of synaptogenesis (formation of synapses 删除换行 between neurons) begins before the surgery and is consolidated after the operative procedure.\n\n【4】In the therapeutic strategy for Chloe， I have therefore taken into consideration the post-lesional brain plasticity that allows the nervous system to be reorganised following physical damage.\n\n【5】How psychosomatic psychotherapy can facilitate and aid the devel-opment of neuronal connections was the problem that confronted me； I was relying heavily on the plasticity of Chloe's brain to make progress.\n\n【6】_The neuronal problems experienced by Chloe_\n\n【7】In psychosomatics， we have developed two approaches to illness： the illness seen by the doctor (hence my meeting with the neurosurgeon) and the illness experienced by the patient. We also ask ourselves what role the illness is playing in the patient’s psychosomatic equilibrium.\n\n【8】What was Chloe suffering from after the operation on her brain?\n\n【9】After her operation， Chloe suffered from paraphasia， epileptic fits， and long periods of insomnia. Her verbal memory and her memory of current experience were affected. She experienced emotions and feel-ings of distress connected mainly with her condition and her lack of vocabulary. As I emphasised above， sometimes she seemed to me very robotic， and sometimes very human， in her desire to recover her verbal capacities. She could remember the atmosphere and general feeling of books， but not the characters or their dialogue.\n\n【10】She was very tired in the first few sessions， often due to nocturnal epileptic fits. She had not dreamt since the previous year； before her operation she had many anxiety-related dreams. According to my clini-cal psychosomatic experience， these dreams are produced by the body sending warning signals to the psyche： the body senses that its homeo-stasis is at risk and the brain worries. Since the operation， her verbal memory has been auditory rather than visual. She remembers every-thing she hears well but not what she reads in books； she makes notes and having read them she no longer remembers where in the book she has made them. She can no longer watch films either because she does not understand all the words she hears or she cannot follow the action of the characters (problem of integration in the auditory cortex). Chloe also wonders about her symptoms and， to help me understand her case， she brings me  a neuropsychology book in which she has noted some paragraphs that I will quote below.\n\n【11】Concerning Alexandre Luria's famous patient，“the man with a shattered world\"， who is called Zazetsky， the book states：\n\n【12】He could no longer understand logic， cause and effect， or spatial relationships. He couldn't distinguish his left from his right . He couldn't comprehend a whole word， understand a whole sentence， or recall a complete memory because doing any of those things would require relating symbols. He could grasp only fleeting fragments. (Doidge，2007， p.33)\n\n【13】Chloe's operation has caused her some problems in her capacity to understand words， to put them together， to form them into intelligible sentences and to remember them all together.\n\n【14】She also tells me about the loss of her automatic linguistic functioning：when she talks with readers at the library， she does not remember all the questions they ask her； she only remembers the first question and tries to answer it. Automatic linguistic functioning， as with hello， goodbye， Happy New Year， and so on， seems to have disappeared. She cannot summon these expressions quickly； she has to think about it to know what she must say. She knows what all the words mean but cannot use them in a conversation. She likes punk music， but for now music is a noise that she cannot interpret； musical harmony has disappeared.\n\n【15】I set myself the following objectives based on our first few conversa-tions and my knowledge of the state of her central nervous system after the operation.\n\n【16】_How to bring Chloe back to life?_\n\n【17】It would be necessary to：\n\n【18】· develop her capacity to form longer sentences， as she could only speak in short phrases expressing a single idea；\n\n【19】●develop her working memory and recall memory；\n\n【20】recover her reading memory by means of motor (procedural) memory-this is a complex process that I will explain in the context of the progression of our encounters；\n\n【21】develop her ability to listen to her body to prevent epileptic fits；\n\n【22】facilitate her access to associations of ideas， to the preconscious， and to the elaborative capacity by making connections between differ-ent semantic fields， the associated emotions and feelings， and the recollection of behaviours.\n\n【23】In short， I needed to rebuild， with Chloe， a psychic apparatus that had been damaged by the tumour and the operation， and thereby to facili-tate rebuilding and strengthening of the synaptic connections.\n\n【24】The concept of the psychic apparatus is totally alien to conventional medicine， and I must say that I make a great deal of effort with my colleagues so that they may understand its functioning and， above all， its existence.\n\n【25】I was unable to put together a team to care for my patient， with each specialist working separately， but Chloe provided the liaison and often informed the neurosurgeon about the progression of her therapeutic work； it is clear that the speech therapist’s work was also outstanding.\n\n【26】_Our meetings and our work continue_\n\n【27】Chloe comes to the next session， bringing me a dream：\n\n【28】_She is lying in her bed in her room and a woman is standing there lifting_ _up the duvet； she shows her a cardboard box that contains a row of five_ _children's bodies of different sizes._\n\n【29】In the previous session， Chloe had brought me a huge number of drawings that she had done in the last fifteen years； we had discussed her artwork at length and I had encouraged her to return to this so that her right hand that suffered from the operation could function again as a result of this learning. I had also advised her to talk openly with Guillaume (her closest colleague) about the disturbances to her work caused by her operation； this colleague had noticed Chloe's handicap but did not dare to talk to her about it.\n\n【30】I began by drawing her attention to the five children's bodies， putting forward the hypothesis that they probably represented her hand， with its five fingers. Chloe cannot associate for the time being， but she has gradually understood how a dream is interpreted. The use of metaphors in this case helps her to understand that the hand's five fingers were enclosed in a cardboard box. She then thinks (this is her interpretation) that it would be difficult for now to return to drawing； hence the five unusable fingers lined up in a cardboard box. This is a possible interpretation that I accept； she states that she is tired and cannot go back to drawing.\n\n【31】She has begun to talk with Guillaume and Andre， who understand her fatigue much better and her difficulty working at the library. She talks to me at length about her relationship with the readers because I ask her about this； she recognises that， because of her current difficul-ties， some people think she is stupid. She finds this hurtful (a narcissis-tic injury)， but says nothing.\n\n【32】I must say that the consequences of her operation meant that Chloe could appear like someone with whom it is difficult to communicate and who does not always understand what is being said to her.\n\n【33】The operation has caused problems in her capacity to understand words， to put them together， to form intelligible sentences from them and to remember them all together. When I talk to her using short sentences she understands perfectly， and we can have long conversa-tions for nearly an hour about many subjects， such as Bunuel's films， Bergman， and the American series or books she has been able to read. She recognises that， with time， she is beginning to recover some of her capacities for attention and concentration， but these have not yet been completely acquired.\n\n【34】Her eyes often get tired and this prevents her from devoting time to reading. She cannot focus her attention and remember what she reads(slight deficiency of the short-term memory). This is therefore an audi-tory impairmentat a very high level of cortical integration， which affects assembling words (the heard word and the read word). Nevertheless， there are some semantic capacities and it seems that she can recover them by working with the speech therapist， and with an orthoptist whom she is also consulting.\n\n【35】In the sessions I am trying to inject some imagination and auditory capacities by the use of metaphors， which is ordinary therapeutic work in psychosomatics. Pierre Marty called this “lending your apparatus for dealing with thoughts\". At the end of the session， Chloe is still tired； she smiles at me kindly and states that she had been tired when she arrived and that now the session has restored her will to live； we then part.\n\n【36】_Next meeting： the \"mirror function\" emerges_\n\n【37】When she arrives at the session， Chloe sits down timidly on the edge of the armchair and looks at me questioningly， anticipating everything from me. She looks at me as a child looks at her mother who is going 删除换行 to take the initiative of speaking to her， telling her things about life， making her feel emotions， and so on. The psychotherapist's maternal function is primordial in psychosomatics. For her， I must be the mirror4of her thoughts and of the experience of her thoughts so that she can rebuild herself.\n\n【38】Ibegin by asking her about the meeting that week with the neuropsy-chologist， who made her take a test and told her that it is her working memory that is functioning poorly. Of course， Chloe and I realised this some time ago now， but this explanation does not satisfy me； I must find a technical procedure that she could use for training so as to recover some of her capacity for understanding long and abstract sentences. As explained above， Chloe does not understand the combination of words in a sentence that is too long.\n\n【39】Before a technical procedure can be formulated， Chloe and I talk about her relationship with Andre and Guillaume and with her work， as well as her relationship with the readers. She is still in the same situ-ation because they are not patient， and often she cannot remember the subjects of the books they choose. She is hurt by the way they look at her. She thinks that she is no longer suited to the quick work of select-ing and accessing books， and feels lost and misunderstood. Chloe is reliving some past episodes of narcissistic wounds and difficulties in overcoming conflictual situations.\n\n【40】We move on， by association， to physical exercises and sports that she might be able to practise； she tells me that she uses her bicycle every day and that she used to ride for very long distances， even hundreds of kilometres. She also practised a Vietnamese combat sport in a club near where she lived. Because of her operation， and from fear of traumatic shocks that might cause an epileptic fit， she gave up combat sports. Chloe is also taking care of herself in dietary terms-we then talk about cooking and meals. She tells me that she has been a vegetarian since she was fourteen； she adopted this diet over twenty years ago. Her mother cooked for her and her two sisters and she has always been greatly concerned with it in her own way； at midday she would eat some pasta and ham， and in the evening， vegetable soup， yoghurt， and fruit. Her mother was not an excellent cook， but she took care of her children and， despite Chloe's criticisms of her， the image that very gradually appears is of a highly ambivalent mother absorbed by her occupation as a maths teacher and the education of her three daughters. For many years， between the ages of five and thirteen， every day at midday her mother 删除换行 would take all three of them to the seaside fairly close to their home and they would eat after having a swim-some pleasant memories are beginning to emerge.\n\n【41】I continue by addressing the relationship between her mother and her father and how they chose each other； she tells me that her father was an engineer； I then suggest an interpretation that makes her laugh a lot： they probably chose each other because they both liked maths. In this way， I encourage her to learn laughter and to distance herself from the parental superego. We then return to technical procedure， because suddenly I think of a technique for overcoming her difficulty in remembering.\n\n【42】Information reaches her more easily by sensory and motor paths and I form the hypothesis that the visual and auditory sensory circuits are partly damaged on several levels， which also involves some disconnec-tions in the psychic domain (c.f.， my interview with the neurosurgeon above). Chloe confirms this hypothesis to me and I then think that the only way of remembering would be to use the motor path： she would take some notes on index cards for each book she reads every week and in this way， by writing with her hand，she will be able to remember what she has read. She confirms to me that when she writes， she remembers what she has written. We decide together that she will use the fingers of her hand to remember what she has read (procedural memory)；she will write the summaries on index cards that she will arrange in a box. That will help her to reply more easily to the readers who ask her for information about the publication of new books.\n\n【43】At the end of the session， she returns to her adolescence； from the age of seventeen， she wandered all over Europe from squat to squat. We may have the opportunity to return to this particular history of wandering.\n\n【44】_The recall technique uses the motricity of the hand_ _and the motor cortices_\n\n【45】After the Christmas holidays， Chloe arrives smiling and relaxed for her session. I greet her with a smile， and ask what has happened since the session before the holidays. She tells me that she was experienc-ing enormous tension and that she had an epileptic fit in the night at home. Thinking aloud， I tell her that the tension created in the last session had generated strong emotions that had increased the 删除换行 neuronal excitation， and that by not being mentally elaborated， the neurones had been discharged in an epileptic fit.\n\n【46】Chloe agrees with this； we must continue to work to reduce her fits as much as possible， but her doctor has informed her that these will not end until two years after her operation. It is obvious that this is only the medical viewpoint.

I encourage her to talk about her childhood， the Christmas celebrations， what relations she has had with her two sisters， Catherine and Sylvie， and with her mother and father. She does not like Christmas celebrations because her mother and all the family members on her mother’s side have never given her what she wanted as a pre-sent. Today she prefers celebrating with her boyfriend Andre and some other friends， but no one in this circle celebrates Christmas or New Year.\n\n【48】Concerning her work， she tells me that she has followed my advice and written some index cards to remind herself of the content of the books she has read with a view to recommending them to readers at the library. It seems that this writing technique， connecting visual words and written words with the hand (motor cortex)， enables her to recall the content of books better. I had thought about using the motor path to supplement the visual word that was not retained in her memory， based on the hypothesis that the hand's motricity could create some new complementary synaptic connections that would be more effec-tive. She confirms to me that she has found this very useful and that she is going to continue with this experiment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Skin swabs should be taken for bacteriology and  删除换行 virology (virology swabs require special viral medium).\n\n【21】The diagnosis is eczema herpeticum with superadded bacterial infection. It would be worth  删除换行 asking if the child has had similar previous episodes or if anyone in the family has herpetic  删除换行 cold sores. Eczema herpeticum is caused by herpes simplex virus infection of eczematous  删除换行 skin. The infection spreads along the skin and haematogenously. Vesicles and pustules occur  删除换行 and these may coalesce, erode the skin and become haemorrhagic and crusted. The lesions  删除换行 can disseminate rapidly and may cause life-threatening infection. Eczema herpeticum may  删除换行 also affect the conjunctiva and cornea, and can cause a keratitis that, if left untreated, may lead  删除换行 to blindness. The diagnosis is sometimes made when a patient fails to respond to antibacterial  删除换行 therapy. The raised temperature, WCC and CRP indicate that the infection is severe, and the  删除换行 lymphocytosis is suggestive of a viral infection. The diagnosis can be made by microscopy,  删除换行 culture or viral polymerase chain reaction.\n\n【22】Bacterial infection can also lead to an acute deterioration in eczema (and is more common  删除换行 than herpetic infection). The pathogen is usually Staphylococcus aureus and occasionally \n\n【23】Streptococcus. Staphylococcal infection can lead to honey-coloured crusting, as in this case. \n\n【24】In George’s case, the secondary bacterial infection is most likely to be due to scratching, lead删除8：<u>￾</u>ing to the Staphylococcus that often colonizes the skin, causing infection.\n\n【25】In some cases, it can be difficult to determine if the eczema has been infected by bacteria or  删除换行 viruses and both need to be treated.\n\n【26】The lymphadenopathy is secondary to the infected eczema.\n\n【27】In some cases of widespread infected eczema, there can be marked fluid loss from the skin,  删除换行 which may be exacerbated in the presence of a temperature. In this case, George is well  删除换行 hydrated, but hydration should be carefully monitored (the situation is somewhat analogous  删除换行 to fluid loss in a burn). Intravenous aciclovir should be administered in severe cases such as  删除换行 this one. In less severe cases, oral aciclovir can be used. If there is any concern about possible  删除换行 eye involvement, as in this case, an urgent ophthalmic opinion should be sought. In addition,  删除换行 intravenous antibiotics (e.g. co-amoxiclav) should be given because of the superadded bacte删除8：<u>￾</u>rial skin infection and possible septicaemia. Analgesics, antipyretics and anti-pruritic agents, \n\n【28】i.e. antihistamines, should be prescribed. Topical treatment with steroids is not associated  删除换行 with poorer outcomes or longer hospital stay, but the evidence for benefit is not as clear as  删除换行 with bacterial infections alone, when steroid creams are usually continued alongside the anti删除8：<u>￾</u>biotic. If continued, they should be reserved for the most inflamed areas. If stopped, topical  删除换行 steroid treatment can usually be restarted once the systemic symptoms have abated, usually  删除换行 within 2–3 days of systemic antiviral and antibiotic treatment.\n\n【29】Key Points\n\n【30】• Herpetic infection can lead to severe worsening of eczema (eczema herpeticum).\n\n【31】• Bacterial infection is the commonest cause for an acute deterioration in eczema,  删除换行 with the commonest pathogen being Staphylococcus aureus.删除5：<u>145</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The condition can be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. \n\n【12】The clinical features are nodular thickening in the palm, with flexion contractures at  删除换行 the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints as show in \n删除3：<u>Fig. 49.1. Dorsal knuckle pads may be thickened (Garrod’s pad) and both hands may be </u>\n\n【13】involved. Typically it is painless.\n\n【14】Dupuytren’s contracture is a benign, slowly progressive fibroproliferative disease of the  删除换行 palmar fascia. After the initial proliferative phase the fibrous tissue and fascial bands  删除换行 within the fingers contract causing flexion deformity of the fingers at the MCP and PIP  删除换行 joints, and rarely the distal (DIP) joint. The MCP joint contracture may be caused by a  删除换行 pretendinous cord or by contracture of the spiral band. PIP joint contractures are caused  删除换行 by the central and spiral cords and the thumb may show a flexion deformity. Abduction  删除换行 may be limited in the fingers as the natatory ligament becomes contracted. The disease  删除换行 presents most commonly in the ring and little fingers and is bilateral in 45 per cent of  删除换行 cases. The fibrous attachment to the skin causes the puckering. Similar nodules may be  删除换行 seen on the sole of the foot (Ledderhose disease) and in fibrosis of the corpus cavernosum \n\n【15】(Peyronie disease).\n\n【16】A more aggressive form of the disease is associated with a positive family history, onset  删除换行 before the age of 40 years, bilateral involvement, involvement of the radial digits and  删除换行 ectopic disease (feet and penis).\n\n【17】Dupuytren’s disease is more common in males and people of northern European origin. \n\n【18】It can be associated with prior hand trauma, alcoholic cirrhosis, epilepsy (due to medica删除8：<u>￾</u>tions such as phenytoin) and diabetes. The prevalence increases with age.\n\n【19】Mild cases may not need any treatment. Surgery is indicated in progressive contractures  删除换行 and established deformity – as in this case. Surgical excision of the diseased fascia (fasci删除8：<u>￾</u>ectomy) is the treatment of choice. Recurrence or extension of the disease after opera删除8：<u>￾</u>tion is not uncommon, particularly in patients with associated fibrosis (Ledderhose and \n\n【20】Peyronie). Surgery is generally indicated for MCP joint contractures of 20–30 degrees. \n\n【21】Any degree of flexion contracture of the PIP joint is an indication for surgery. The opera删除8：<u>￾</u>tion will involve either a fasciotomy (incising the fascia only), fasciectomy (removing as  删除换行 much fascia as possible), dermofasciectomy (removing the diseased fascia and overlying  删除换行 skin), or regional fasciectomy (excising only the involved fascia).\n\n【22】KEY POINTS\n\n【23】• Dupuytren’s contracture is a slowly progressive fibroproliferative disease of the palmar  删除换行 fascia. It presents most commonly in the ring and little fingers.\n\n【24】• Look for nodular thickening in the palm, flexion contractures at the MCP and PIP  删除换行 joints, and Garrod’s pad.\n\n【25】• It is associated with prior hand trauma, alcoholic cirrhosis, epilepsy (due to  删除换行 medications such as phenytoin) and diabetes.\n\n【26】• Surgery is indicated in progressive contracture and established deformity.删除5：<u>135</u>\nOrthopaedics", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The GCS is an objective score that allows a patient’s neurological  删除换行 function to be accurately assessed and monitored.\n\n【19】Table 81.1 Scoring on the Glasgow Coma Scale\n\n【20】GCS score Best  删除换行 eye response (E)\n\n【21】Best  删除换行 verbal response (V)\n\n【22】Best  删除换行 motor response (M)\n\n【23】1 Does not open eyes Makes no sounds Makes no movements 删除换行 2 Eyes open to pain Incomprehensible  删除换行 sounds\n\n【24】Extension to painful stimuli \n\n【25】(decerebrate response)\n\n【26】3 Eyes open to voice Inappropriate words Abnormal flexion to  删除换行 painful stimuli (decorticate  删除换行 response)\n\n【27】4 Eyes open  删除换行 spontaneously\n\n【28】Confused Flexes/withdraws from  删除换行 painful stimuli 删除换行 5 – Orientated, normal  删除换行 conversation\n\n【29】Localizes painful stimuli 删除换行 6 – – Moves obeying commands\n\n【30】The patient has a history of substance misuse, and from the examination it can be con删除8：<u>￾</u>cluded that he has injected himself with something, probably heroin. Like morphine,  删除换行 heroin is an opiate drug and features of opiate toxicity are manifold.\n\n【31】• Respiratory system. There is a slow respiratory rate with shallow breathing. This can  删除换行 progress to respiratory arrest.\n\n【32】• Abdominal system. Vomiting is common and, if the patient has a reduced conscious删除8：<u>￾</u>ness level, there is a risk of aspirating (inhaling) the vomit. Later, once the patient has  删除换行 recovered, he/she is likely to be constipated, as the opiate drug will slow intestinal  删除换行 motility.\n\n【33】• Neurological system. Patients show a reduced consciousness level and may be unable  删除换行 to protect the airway. They may present anywhere on a spectrum from alert and ori删除8：<u>￾</u>entated, to confused and drowsy, to comatose. A classic sign of opiate toxicity is small  删除换行 pupils, which are often described as ‘pin-point’.\n\n【34】The first thing to do is assess the patient according to the ABCD protocol. Then a scoring  删除换行 system should be applied. For example, a GCS score of 8 or less means that the patient 217 删除换行 is probably not able to safely protect his/her own airway, so simple airway management  删除换行 techniques should be carried out until a senior doctor or member of the anaesthetics team  删除换行 can assess for more definitive airway management.\n\n【35】Naloxone is an opiate antagonist and can be used to reverse the effects of morphine and  删除换行 heroin. Naloxone acts within seconds and patients will often dramatically regain con删除8：<u>￾</u>sciousness, but the drug effect lasts only for a few minutes. An infusion of naloxone may  删除换行 need to be given; ideally this would be done in a high-dependency setting.\n\n【36】KEY POINTS\n\n【37】• In any patient with a reduced consciousness level, a neurological scoring system  删除换行 should be applied. This allows monitoring of improvement or deterioration in  删除换行 consciousness.\n\n【38】• Signs of opiate overdose include reduced consciousness level, pin-point pupils,  删除换行 reduced respiratory rate and vomiting.\n\n【39】• With a suspected opiate overdose, help from senior doctors should be sought as the  删除换行 patient may need to be managed in a high-dependency setting.删除6：<u>This page intentionally left blank 219</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

His heart rate is 115/min, respiratory rate is 24/min, and blood pressure is 140/80 mm Hg in both arms. Lung examination shows decreased breath sounds and decreased fremitus on the right with hyperresonance to percussion.

This patient is most likely suffering from a spontaneous pneumothorax. Caused by the rupture of a small apical bleb on the surface of the lung, spontaneous pneumothoraces typically present in tall young men. The patient usually has sudden pain and dyspnea. Examination will show decreased breath sounds and hyperresonance on the affected side. X-ray of the chest shows overexpansion of the rib cage and an elevated hemidiaphragm on the affected side. This paradoxical abdominal motion occurs because of the negative intrathoracic pressure that causes the fatigued diaphragm to be pulled into the thorax on the right side. Spontaneous pneumothorax is treated by inserting a chest tube to remove the air from the pleural space.  \n\n【7】Answer A is incorrect. Aortic dissection, not a pneumothorax, would show up on x-ray of the chest as a widened mediastinum. Aortic dissection can occur in trauma, or a dissecting aortic aneurysm can occur in connective tissue diseases such as Marfan disease. The physical findings are not consistent with aortic dissection: first, the chest would not be hyperresonant to percussion and second, the blood pressure would not be equal in both arms.  \n\n【8】Answer B is incorrect. Barrel chests and flattened diaphragms are seen in patients with obstructive lung diseases such as chronic emphysema. Although emphysema is caused by smoking, this patient does not have a long enough smoking history. It is possible that this man could have emphysema due to an α1 \\-antitrypsin deficiency, but in that case it would not present this acutely.  \n\n【9】Answer C is incorrect. Consolidation of the right lower lobe on x-ray of the chest usually means pneumonia. The patient would present with fever, productive cough, and a high WBC count. Physical exam would show decreased resonance on the affected side and increased fremitus.  \n\n【10】Answer D is incorrect. In tension pneumothorax, a flap-like pleural tear allows air to enter into the pleural cavity, but prevents its exit. It can be caused by penetrating trauma to the chest resulting in increased pleural cavity pressure. Clinical findings include sudden onset of severe dyspnea, tympanitic percussion, and absent breath sounds. There is tracheal deviation and mediastinal structure deviation to the contralateral side. If tension pneumothorax occurs on the left side, there would be compression of venous return to the heart.

These are findings characteristic of an upper gas删除8：<u>￾</u>trointestinal (GI) bleed, with the black stools secondary to breakdown of haemoglobin as blood  删除换行 transits through the GI tract. Important causes of upper GI bleeding include peptic ulcer dis删除8：<u>￾</u>ease, upper GI malignancy, variceal bleeding in portal hypertension and Mallory–Weiss tears. \n\n【14】In this patient, the history of regular use of ibuprofen makes peptic ulcer disease the most  删除换行 likely cause as this, like other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), causes gastric  删除换行 mucosal damage by inhibiting production of prostaglandins, which protests the mucosa.\n\n【15】The presence of hypotension and tachycardia indicates moderate–severe blood loss, and the  删除换行 patient should be managed in the resuscitation room. Immediate management should pro删除8：<u>￾</u>ceed along the ‘ABCDE’ approach, with consideration of intubation for airway protection  删除换行 in patients with ongoing haematemesis, establishment of at least two sites of large-bore  删除换行 intravenous access and administration of crystalloid fluid boluses. A cross-match should be  删除换行 sent in preparation for possible blood transfusion, and given this patient’s hypotension and  删除换行 tachycardia, thereby suggesting active bleeding, at least 1 unit of packed red cells should  删除换行 be transfused with regular monitoring of the haemoglobin. Consideration could even be  删除换行 given to transfusing group O blood given the likely extent of hypovolaemia in this patient. \n\n【16】Transfusion is typically performed if the haemoglobin is less than 7 g/dL for most patients,  删除换行 but in cases where active bleeding is suspected, the haemoglobin may be falsely elevated due  删除换行 to haemoconcentration. Proton-pump inhibitors are not recommended pre-endoscopy, but  删除换行 there may be some value in the administration of tranexamic acid, which is currently being  删除换行 evaluated in a large randomised controlled trial (HALTiT).\n\n【17】As the patient is stabilised, urgent consultation with gastroenterology is required in prepara删除8：<u>￾</u>tion for upper GI endoscopy, particularly in cases of severe bleeding such as this. Risk strati删除8：<u>￾</u>fication tools are available to help guide the treating physician on the urgency of endoscopy;  删除换行 the Blatchford score is one such tool and relies on parameters such as the levels of urea and  删除换行 haemoglobin, systolic blood pressure and presence of melaena or syncope. The Rockall score  删除换行 is another such tool, but its use in the emergency setting is hampered by the fact that endo删除8：<u>￾</u>scopic findings are needed in computing the score.\n\n【18】Upper GI endoscopy should be performed once the patient is sufficiently stable, and gener删除8：<u>￾</u>ally within 24 hours of presentation even in non-severe bleeding. An endoscopy provides both  删除换行 diagnostic and therapeutic benefits, and the findings at endoscopy can also help predict risk of  删除换行 re-bleeding, which is also influenced by other factors such as haemodynamic instability, a haemo删除8：<u>￾</u>globin of less than 10 g/dL at presentation, large ulcer size and ulcer location. In cases such as this,  删除换行 where several of these factors are present, the patient should ideally be managed in an ICU setting.\n\n【19】Key Points\n\n【20】• Upper GI bleeding is characterised by haematemesis and melaena, and a history of \n\n【21】NSAID use must always be elicited given the associated risk of peptic ulcer disease.\n\n【22】• Supportive management includes fluid resuscitation, blood transfusion (if haemo删除8：<u>￾</u>globin is <7 g/dL or in cases of active bleeding), intravenous tranexamic acid and  删除换行 preparation for upper GI endoscopy.\n\n【23】• Risk stratification tools such as the Blatchford score can be used to help triage  删除换行 patients and determine the need for an urgent endoscopy.删除5：<u>91</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Early small-cell carcinoma management entails chemotherapy; early non-small-cell carcinomas can be treated via surgical resection. Survival time for those with untreated small-cell carcinoma is 6-17 weeks. With chemotherapy, median survival increases to 18 months.  \n\n【20】Answer A is incorrect. Surgery does not carry a risk of provoking para-neoplastic syndromes in small-cell carcinoma of the lung. In pheochromocytoma, however, manipulation of the tumor during surgical resection is known to stimulate catecholamine release.  \n\n【21】Answer C is incorrect. Surgical resection has not been shown to improve morbidity or mortality for small-cell lung cancer, and is thus contra-indicated because of increased and unnecessary morbidity. Resection may be more effective for non-small-cell lung carcinoma. Some patients with very advanced GI tumors benefit from surgical resection to relieve obstructive symptoms.  \n\n【22】Answer D is incorrect. Surgical resection is more effective for non-small-lung carcinoma. It leads to increased morbidity and no improvement in survival in patients with small-cell carcinoma.  \n\n【23】Answer E is incorrect. This explanation would suggest that _no therapy_ is the best course of action, which is false. There are few masses for which nothing is done; an example is the cutaneous hemangioma seen in pediatric patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

It has five forms: OCA1A, OCA1B (yellow albinism), OCA2 (brown albinism), OCA3 (rufous/red type) and OCA4 (least common) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The global estimated frequency of OCA is 1:20000. The major two forms, OCA1 (tyrosine-negative) and OCA2 (tyrosine-positive) constitute 90% of the cases seen worldwide and OCA2 is the most prevalent form 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. OCA3 and OCA4 are rare.\n\n【21】In OCA1A, genetic mutations in TYR gene completely abolish tyrosinase activity, while mutations rendering some enzyme activity result in OCA1B allowing some accumulation of melanin pigment over time. The gene implicated in OCA2 is P, important for normal processing and transport of melanosomal proteins such as TYR and TYRP1. Mutations in Tyrp1 gene in OCA3 result in delayed maturation and an early degradation of Tyr. Mutations in the membrane-associated transporter protein gene (MATP) cause OCA4 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】OCA1A is the most severe type showing complete absence of melanin production throughout life. The skin, hair, eyelashes and eyebrows are all white, and skin does not tan. Iris are light blue to pink and completely translucent along with intense photophobia and visual acuity 1/10 or less. The prominent ocular anomalies include congenital nystagmus , reduced pigmentation of the retinal pigment epithelium, foveal hypoplasia, misrouting of the optic nerve fibres at optic chiasma resulting in strabismus and reduced stereoscopic vision 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In OCA1B, OCA2 and OCA4, the hair and skin may develop some pigment with time, irises are green/brown and visual acuity improves. OCA3 patients have red hair and reddish brown skin with no detectable visual anomalies are not always detectable 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. A few other unusual ocular changes are Duane retraction syndrome, corneal mesodermal dysgenesis, and congenital glaucoma. Risk of development of non-melanoma skin cancer is also high in OCA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】Chediak–Higashi syndrome (CHS) is a rare, autosomal recessive multi-system disorder caused by mutation in LYST gene. It is characterized by hypopigmentation of the skin, eyes and hair, prolonged bleeding time, easy bruisability, recurrent infection, abnormal NK cell function and peripheral neuropathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Most of the patients develop an accelerated phase of the disease characterized by fever, jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, pancytopenia, coagulopathy and neurological abnormalities, unlike in OCA. The presence of massive peroxidase-positive lysosomal inclusion in the leukocytes, fibroblasts and melanocytes is diagnostic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by reduced pigmentation of skin, hair, iris and retina, platelet storage-pool deficiency and lysosomal accumulation of ceroid lipofuscin in various tissues including reticuloendothelial system. It mostly results from the mutation in HPS 1 and 3 genes associated with the formation of lysosome-related organelles. Although oculocutaneous presentation simulate the picture of OCA but the systemic findings such as bleeding diathesis, interstitial lung fibrosis, granulomatous colitis, cardiomyopathy and renal dysfunction help to differentiate it from OCA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】Cross syndrome or Cross-McKusick-Breen Syndrome is an inherited (autosomal recessive) oculocerebral syndrome, characterized by hypopigmentation of the skin and hair, and oculocerebral abnormalities. The common features shared with OCA include autosomal recessive trait, unusually light skin color, silvery-gray hair, hypopigmented iris and nystagmus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. There are certain other characteristic findings which are frequently present in this syndrome. These are delayed developmental milestones (psychomotor retardation), corneal opacities, microphthalmia, iris atrophy, cataract, optic nerve atrophy, gingival fibromatosis, high arched palate, oligophrenia, dolichocephaly, athetosis, spastic paraplegia and Dandy-Walker type cystic malformation of posterior fossa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】Genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis is an integral part of management of OCA. The gene mutational analysis is done by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography and single stranded conformational polymorphism followed by DNA sequencing.\n\n【27】Treatment is given according to the types and severity of OCA. Bifocal glasses help to correct low visual acuity and dark/photochromic lenses are used to prevent photophobia. Surgery of the ocular muscles may be done to cure nystagmus . For strabismus, it may be necessary to patch one eye in children to force the non-preferred eye to be used. Most people with severe forms of OCA do not tan and easily get sunburned, therefore sunscreens are recommended with at least a sun protection factor of 15.\n\n【28】### Key Points\n\n【29】*   OCA is the most common inherited disorder of generalized hypopigmentation due to genetic defects in melanin biosynthesis.\n\n【30】*   It has five forms: OCA1A, OCA1B, OCA2, OCA3 and OCA4.\n\n【31】*   OCA2 is the most common type and affects 1:4000 of the population in some parts of Africa.\n\n【32】*   OCA1A is most severe type with complete lack of pigmentation in skin, hair and eyes. There is no pigment synthesis with age.\n\n【33】*   Other types are milder and develop pigmentation over time.\n\n【34】*   Hematologic tests, ophthalmic and systemic examination are mandatory to rule out other syndromic entities presenting with partial OCA.\n\n【35】###", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Correction of the Transverse Problems\n========================================\n\n【3】Julia Harfin <sup>1<a><span class=\"ContactIcon\"></span></a></sup>\n\n【4】通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>\n\n【5】Department of Orthodontics, Maimonides University, Buenos Aires, Argentina\n\n【6】Julia Harfin\n\n【7】Email: harfinjulia@gmail.com\n\n【8】Normalization of the upper arch has always been one of the most important issues in the treatment of young children with constricted maxillary arch or with uni- or bilateral crossbite.\n\n【9】The etiology is multifactorial and the functional problems play an important role. The environmental factors are determinant not only in the beginning but also in the maintenance of the malocclusion. It can be present in class I, II, or III patients with or without crowding.\n\n【10】It is acknowledged worldwide that transverse problems have to be normalized in temporary or early mixed dentition to allow a normal eruption of the bicuspids and cuspids.\n\n【11】It is well accepted that the younger the patient, the easier it is to achieve excellent results with fewer chances of relapse. The most appropriate timing for treatment appears to be before the eruption of the permanent lateral incisors.\n\n【12】The recovery of the normal maxillary width not only allows the gaining of space in the lateral areas but also gives the tongue more space to function in the correct position and maintain the results until adulthood.\n\n【13】After the treatment not only is the normalization of the arch perimeter achieved but in most of the cases the patients recover normal nose breathing (day and night) and stop snoring.\n\n【14】Moreover, limited information is available about the long-term stability of the changes of the airway produced by RME (Mc Namara). Some studies have shown that maxillary constriction has a very close relationship with apnea in children, and this is an important issue to take into account.\n\n【15】Treatment planning includes palatal expansion that can be carried out by different appliances depending on whether the objective is to obtain a skeletal or dentoalveolar expansion.\n\n【16】Dentoalveolar expansion produces dental expansion without any skeletal change and in general a removable appliance is used. This type of appliance is able to tip the teeth buccally but is not able to open the midpalatal suture .\n删除3：<u>Fig. 9.1\n\n【17】( a , b ) Example of a removable appliance to correct a slight transverse problem\n</u>\nWhen the diagnosis indicates that a skeletal expansion is recommendable, it has to be performed by a fixed appliance, and the result is the movement of the maxillary shelves away from each other  The pre- and post-occlusal radiographs after 2 weeks of activation of a rapid palatal expander showed the expansion that was produced in the midpalatal suture very clearly.\n删除3：<u>Fig. 9.2\n\n【18】( a , b ) Pre and post-occlusal radiographs after the use of a rapid maxillary expander for 2 weeks\n</u>\nDr. Emerson Angell 删除10：<u>(Angell 1860 )</u> was one of the first to splint the midpalatal suture and described the use of a screw to achieve maxillary expansion in 1860. However, it was Dr. Andrew Haas who presented the RME as a routine clinical procedure to treat the narrow maxilla 删除10：<u>(Hass 1961 , 1965 , 1980 , 1997 )</u>.\n\n【19】It is highly recommendable that this procedure be initiated prior the ossification of the midpalatal suture. There is an individual variation among all the patients, but it is recognized that in general girls complete their growth period between 12 and 14 years of age and boys a little later (14–17 years old).\n\n【20】This procedure is always used in order to increase maxillary arch perimeter, correct uni- or bilateral crossbite, improve anterior crossbite, and in some cases improve airway flow.\n\n【21】According to the diagnosis and treatment plan, all the appliances have a similar design with bands on the first molars or metallic crowns on the first and second temporary molars. Different designs were described by different authors (bonded or cemented), but all of them include a central expansion screw.\n\n【22】The activation protocol involves the generation of orthopedic forces that could split the midpalatal suture. The screw has to be activated 1, 2, or 3 times a day (one quarter turn) according to the individualized treatment objectives. No pain and little discomfort could be present during the first days. The parents and the patients have to be instructed on the maintenance of the appliance, and strict oral hygiene is necessary. Very few difficulties in speech and mastication could be present during the first 3–4 days.\n\n【23】It is advisable to give the patient an instruction sheet listing the schedule of activation and all the cares to take into account during the whole procedure. The parents’ help is invaluable.\n\n【24】Normally the suture will open between 6 and 10 days.\n\n【25】An important interincisal diastema is always present when the midpalatal suture is set apart and then closes spontaneously after in 2–3 weeks due to the action of the supracrestal fibers. The patient has to be controlled once a week to monitor the treatment during the expansion phase.\n\n【26】The lack of space in the anterior region is also an indication for using RME during the early mixed dentition period 删除10：<u>(Rosa et al. 2012 )</u>. This procedure does not require any patient cooperation and allows the increase of the perimeter of the upper arch.\n\n【27】In general, raising of the bite is not necessary in meso-, braqui-, or dolichofacial patients. The results are very predictable in a relatively short period of time.\n\n【28】Different types of RME can be used .\n删除3：<u>Fig. 9.3\n\n【29】( a , b ) Different types of RME can be used with the same protocol of activation\n</u>\nThe following patients are a clear example of the results that can be achieved using this protocol.\n\n【30】The first one is an 8-year-old patient that was sent to the office by the family dentist due to a lack of space for the eruption of the upper lateral incisors. The mother was worried about the central interincisal diastema. Mild constriction of the upper arch was present at the beginning of the treatment .\n删除3：<u>Fig. 9.4\n\n【31】( a , b ) Pretreatment intraoral photographs. The lack of space for the upper lateral incisors was evident\n</u>\nTo increase the transversal width of the upper arch, a standard rapid maxillary expander was bonded with bands on the second temporary upper molars in order to protect the first molars and avoid eventual decalcifications or cavities. A distal extension wire was welded to the screw toward the right and left first molars and a mesial one until the temporary canines . The screw was activated twice a day (once in the morning and again after dinner). The results were achieved in 2 weeks and as always the interincisal diastema became wider .\n删除3：<u>Fig. 9.5\n\n【32】( a , b ) Results after 14 days of activation. A wider diastema was clearly visible\n</u>\nAs was expected 3 weeks later, the diastema was almost closed, and the upper lateral incisors began to erupt. The expander’s screw was fixed with composite. In these cases, it is highly recommendable that the same appliance be used as a fixed retainer for a period of 6 months, at least .\n删除3：<u>Fig. 9.6\n\n【33】( a , b ) After 3 weeks the diastema was almost closed. The expander screw was fixed with composite\n</u>\nFor personal reasons the patient returned 3 years later, and no other orthodontic treatment had been performed in that time. The upper lateral incisors erupted and the interincisal diastema was closed. The occlusal photograph showed that the bicuspids erupted in their right position and the width of the upper arch was maintained .\n删除3：<u>Fig. 9.7\n\n【34】( a , b ) Results 3 years later without any orthodontic treatment. All the treatment objectives were achieved\n</u>\nThis patient is a clear example of the importance of the normalization of the arch perimeter in the early mixed dentition.\n\n【35】In cases where the extraction of bicuspids is necessary, it is important that they be postponed until the rapid maxillary expansion process is concluded.\n\n【36】In general, a retention period of 6 months with the appliance in place is recommendable in order to control any type of relapse and permit a complete reorganization of the suture and all the surrounding tissues. This time is also important to allow the adaptation of the facial muscles to the new transverse dimension of the maxillary arch.\n\n【37】Otherwise, relapse will be the consequence. It is important to keep in mind that muscles play an important role in maintaining the results achieved in the transverse dimension.\n\n【38】In general, when the RME appliance is placed on the temporary molars, a slight normalization of the position of the incisors is achieved as a result of the anterior expansion of the upper arch perimeter in the early mixed dentition.\n\n【39】There is no doubt about the effectiveness of the RME when it is cemented on the temporary molars with a wire welded to the palatal surfaces of the first permanent molars. In general expansion is achieved in the first permanent molar area too 删除10：<u>(Mutinelli et al. 2008 )</u> .\n删除3：<u>Fig. 9.8\n\n【40】( a , b ) An example of a RME bonded on the temporary molars. The use of crowns on the temporary molars is advisable for better retention\n</u>\nThe efficacy of this appliance is well acknowledged by all the orthodontists. The relationship between the arch perimeter and arch expansion was very well studied by Adkins and co-workers. They concluded as an average 0,7 mm of arch perimeter is increased after 1 mm of transpalatal width enlargement, but these proportions could vary according to the age and patient facial biotype.\n\n【41】The next 8-year-old patient was sent to the office by her mother, a pediatric pulmonologist, that was worried about the triangular shape of the her maxillary arch . The child was a mouth breather until 6 years of age, and after a 1-year treatment with a speech therapist, she was able to correct this habit. To normalize the shape of the upper arch and at the same time make sufficient space for the upper incisors, a RME was placed with bands on the first molars and extension wires bonded to the temporary canines. The activation protocol was two turns a day. The interincisal diastema was visible after the first week of treatment .\n删除3：<u>Fig. 9.9\n\n【42】( a , b ) Pretreatment occlusal photograph and 1 week after the activation of a RME\n</u>\nEight months later, metal preprogrammed brackets (0.022″) were bonded on the rotated upper incisors and temporary canines to correct their position with a SS 0,016″ archwire for a 6-month period . Excellent results were achieved 7 months later. The cuspids and bicuspids erupted in the correct position without any additional appliance. The arch width was maintained and a removable retention was placed .\n删除3：<u>Fig. 9.10\n\n【43】( a , b ) Occlusal photographs during second phase of treatment and at the end of the active procedure\n</u>\nThe comparison between the pre- and posttreatment smile clearly showed its improvement.

A significant improvement was achieved\n</u>\nThe lateral smile photographs confirmed how the thickness of the upper lip changed. Since the facial biotype plays an important role in the maintenance of the results, it is important to determine an individualized treatment plan. A 6-month follow-up was recommended until the second molars are fully erupted .\n删除3：<u>Fig. 9.12\n\n【45】( a , b ) The improvement in the thickness of the upper lip in concordance with a broadened smile was more than satisfactory\n</u>\nSilva and co-workers describe that after RME, the maxilla is displaced downward and backward. Meanwhile, Hass showed that the result is a slight bite opening and a forward displacement of point A. It is very difficult to compare all these studies.\n\n【46】The retention protocol could change according to various circumstances and includes a removable palatal plate such as a Hawley or Schwartz appliance or functional appliances like Trainers. There is no specific period of time for all patients, but a minimum of 12 months is required in order to give the reorganization of the soft and hard tissues enough time to avoid relapse.\n\n【47】The following case is another interesting example of correction of transverse problems. The following patient was 7 years, 6 months of age in the first consultation. He was the youngest of four children, three of them with class III molar and canine.\n\n【48】No important medical history was present.\n\n【49】She had difficulties with the pronunciation of some consonants due to the absence of the upper incisors in conjunction with the anterior position of the tongue .\n删除3：<u>Fig. 9.13\n\n【50】( a , b ) Pretreatment frontal and occlusal photographs of a 7-year, 6-month-old patient\n</u>\nUpon analyzing the lateral views, a slight compression in the temporary canine and molar region was present.

It is divided into two categories: nonbullous and bullous impetigo. Nonbullous impetigo is the more common form that is responsible for 70 % of cases and occurs in individuals of all ages. It is usually caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus ( Streptococcus pyogenes ). The lesions begin as vesicles that quickly rupture and produce a characteristic honey-colored crust.\n\n【20】Bullous impetigo is caused by Staphylococcus aureus and is more likely to affect neonates and older infants. These lesions also begin as vesicles that quickly enlarge to form bullae containing clear or yellowish fluid. After 2 or 3 days these bullae rupture and form light brown crusts that border erythematous erosions. The lesions are usually painless and heal without scarring. Some patients complain of pruritus or a burning sensation. Microscopically, the vesicle is separated at the level of the stratum corneum which contains a few trapped neutrophils .\n删除3：<u>Figure 13.2\n\n【21】H&E 100×. Bacteria infection, Impetigo\n</u>\nImpetigo usually occurs around the nose and the mouth and is also frequently seen on exposed extremities. It develops at sites of minor skin trauma like abrasions that permit “impetiginzation” or introduction of the infection. Impetigo tends to affect individuals with compromised skin barriers and immune systems like those with atopic dermatitis and diabetes. Streptococcal impetigo is seen more often in warm, humid climates, during the summer months, and spreads quickly in overcrowded environments.\n\n【22】In bullous impetigo, S aureus produces an exfoliative toxin that causes the development of the bulla. Methicillin-resistant S aureus is becoming an increasingly common etiologic agent. In industrialized countries, mixed infections are becoming more frequent, as well. Typically the infection begins as a streptococcal infection that is then secondarily infected by S aureus .\n\n【23】Impetigo is a clinical diagnosis. A work up is unnecessary unless MRSA is suspected and then a culture can be performed with antibiotic sensitivities and resistance. A contact dermatitis could have a similar clinical and microscopic appearance, but microscopically there would be no bacteria seen by special stains.\n\n【24】Treatment\n---------\n\n【25】For most cases of impetigo, topical mupirocin treatment is usually sufficient. In cases of infections over a large surface area, fever, complicating cellulitis or other systemic systems, oral therapy can be started. Topical mupirocin is a safe option with published success rates of greater than 90 %. It is applied topically to the affected area three times a day. In order for the topical treatment to be effective, the affected area must be washed with antibacterial soap and wiped with wet compresses to remove the crust. All orifices in the vicinity of the infection, particularly the nares are often reservoirs of bacteria. So these areas should be treated with mupirocin to prevent recurrent infection. A novel formulation that consistent of plant extracts has been shown to exhibit potent anti-microbial activity against a broad spectrum of Gram positive and negative organisms, including MRSA.\n\n【26】Retapamulin is a newer topical antibiotic on the market. It is approved for the treatment of impetigo caused by S aureus or S pyogenes in adults and children older than 9 months. A large meta-analysis found it to be as effective or slightly more effective than systemic therapy with erythromycin. Non-MRSA oral antibiotics include erythromycin, cephalexin, and amoxicillin-clavulanate. In cases of MRSA infection, coverage can be provided with TMP-SMX, doxycycline, clindamycin or linezolid.\n\n【27】Prevention\n----------\n\n【28】Due to its highly contagious nature, good personal hygiene is strongly recommended. Close contacts and household members are at increased risk of acquiring infection. Also at risk are individuals who are team members and share sports equipment. It is recommended that children with impetigo stay home for the first 24 h after beginning antibiotic treatment to reduce the risk of spread to other children. Scratching should be discouraged to decrease the likelihood of auto-inoculation.\n删除16：<u>Recommended Reading\n\n【29】通用删除2(英):<u>Bolaji RS, Dabade TS, Gustafson CJ, et al.

Hence， calcium balance is critical for the maintenance of normal body func-tions. Calcium balance is a dynamic process that reflects a balance among calcium absorption by the intestinal tract， calcium excretion by the kidney， and release and uptake of calcium by bone during bone formation and resorption . Most body calcium is stored in bone (~1000 g)， which is a very dynamic site as bone is remodeled continuously， with only approximately 0.1% in the extracellular fluid (~1 g). Although only a small fraction of total body calcium (and phosphate) is located in the plasma， it is the plasma concentration of ionized calcium (and phosphate) that is tightly regulated， primarily under the control of PTH and vitamin D. Both of these hormones regulate calcium absorption by the intes-tine， bone formation and resorption， and urinary calcium excretion. Calcitonin and， to a smaller extent， estrogens also regulate calcium and phosphate home-ostasis， although the mechanisms are not fully understood.**\n\n【22】**PTH， a peptide hormone， is synthesized and secreted by the chief cells of the parathyroid glands. In contrast to most secretory processes， low levels of extracellular calcium (ionized plasma calcium) induce secretion of PTH， whereas high levels inhibit secretion of PTH. The ionized calcium levels are sensed by a calcium-sensing receptor， CaSR， in the plasma membrane； this is a G protein-coupled receptor. Upon binding of calcium during periods of high calcium levels， phospholipase C (PLC) is activated， generating 1，4，5-triphosphate (IP，) and diacylglycerol (DAG) and， in turn， inducing release of calcium from internal storage sites and activation of protein kinase C (PKC)， respectively. Both the elevation of intracellular calcium levels and the activa-tion of PKC inhibit the secretion (and synthesis) of PTH. In contrast， in the presence of low plasma calcium levels， less calcium is bound to the CaSR， leading to enhanced PTH secretion (and synthesis).**\n\n【23】**PTH is a potent regulator of plasma-ionized calcium levels， acting at three sites to increase plasma levels. First， PTH enhances intestinal calcium (and phosphate) absorption in the presence of permissive amounts of vitamin D. Second， PTH stimulates bone resorption， resulting in the release of calcium phosphate. Third， PTH stimulates the active reabsorption of cal-cium from the kidney . The effects of PTH at the three sites lead to an elevation in ionized plasma calcium levels. In the presence of low PTH levels， these effects are reversed， resulting in a lowering of plasma calcium levels .**\n\n【24】**Vitamin D is a steroid hormone that is intimately involved in the regu-lation of plasma calcium levels. Its role in calcium metabolism first was recognized in the childhood disease rickets， which is associated with a defi-ciency of a fat-soluble vitamin and is characterized by a hypocalcemia with various skeletal abnormalities. The disease is corrected by dietary vitamin**\n\n【25】**PTH Secretion**\n删除3：<u>Figure 38-1. Regulation of plasma Ca²+by PTH. PTH secretion from the chief cells of the parathyroid gland is regulated by plasma Ca+levels. High plasma Ca’+ levels are sensed by the chief cell calcium-sensing receptor to inhibit PTH synthesis and secretion， while low plasma Ca+ levels have the opposite effect， stimulating PTH synthesis and secretion. In the presence of low plasma Ca+， PTH secretion works to increase plasma Ca’+ at three sites： the kidney， where PTH promotes Ca²+ reabsorption from the late distal tubule and con-necting tubule and promotes conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to its active form， 1，25-dihydroxyvitamin D， in the proximal tubule； the intestine， where the elevated levels of 1，25-dihydroxyvitamin D (because of elevated PTH) stimulate calcium absorption； and bone， where PTH promotes net bone resorp-tion. All three sites lead to an increase in plasma Ca+levels back toward nor-mal values .</u>\n\n【26】**D replacement therapy. Vitamin D is present in the diet and can be synthesized in the skin from 7-dehydrocholesterol in the presence of ultraviolet light. As this molecule passes through the liver， it is hydroxylated to 25-hydrox-yvitamin D (25-hydroxycholecalciferol)， the inactive form of vitamin D.25-Hydroxyvitamin D travels by the circulation to the kidney， where proximal tubule cells contain the enzyme 1 o-hydroxylase， which converts the mole-cule to 1，25-dihydroxyvitamin D， the most active form of vitamin D. The activity of the 1 c-hydroxylase is tightly controlled by PTH and plasma phos-phate levels. PTH and hypophosphatemia stimulate 1 o-hydroxylase activ-ity， resulting in elevated vitamin D levels and the maintenance of calcium (and phosphate) balance . In contrast， low PTH levels and hyperphos-phatemia inhibit the enzyme， reducing the production of vitamin D.**\n\n【27】**Although vitamin D has numerous actions， its two dominant actions appear to be to enhance the availability of calcium and phosphate for new bone formation and to prevent an abnormal rise or fall in plasma calcium and phosphate levels such as symptomatic hypocalcemia and hypophos-phatemia. It does this by acting on all three primary sites of regulation of cal-cium balance. First， vitamin D increases the production of several intestinal proteins， including a luminal membrane calcium channel and a high-affinity cytosolic calcium-binding protein (calbindin)， that enhance tran-scellular absorption of calcium. PTH also is thought to stimulate intestinal calcium absorption， but this may be an indirect effect in which the PTH-induced increase in vitamin D formation in the kidney leads to enhanced intes-tinal calcium absorption. Second， in the kidney， vitamin D appears to act in a synergistic fashion with PTH to induce active calcium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule and connecting tubule  by increasing the synthesis of a distinct luminal membrane calcium channel and a cytosolic calcium-binding protein (calbindin). Third， vitamin D induces resorption of bone， mobilization of calcium， and bone mineralization after an elevation of plasma calcium levels. Hence， the actions of vitamin D on calcium metabolism are complex， but all point to control of the prevention of alterations in plasma calcium levels.**\n\n【28】**Calcitonin is a third hormone that is thought to underlie control of calcium balance， although its role in humans is not well defined. Calcitonin is synthe-sized and secreted by C cells in the thyroid gland. It is stored in secretory vesicles within the C cells and released after an elevation in extracellular calcium levels above normal. The role of calcitonin in calcium homeostasis. however， is questioned. With complete removal of calcitonin in thyroidec-tomized individuals or with overproduction of calcitonin in individuals with rare C-cell tumors， plasma calcium， vitamin D， and PTH levels are normal. Nonetheless， calcitonin may play a secondary role in calcium homeostasis in tissue that expresses a calcitonin receptor. The osteoclast bone cells appear to be a particular target of calcitonin； high levels of calcitonin are sensed and lead to inhibition of bone resorption， thereby slowing bone turnover and potentially**\n\n【29】**contributing to the generation of hypocalcemia. In the kidney， calcitonin causes mild natriuresis and calciuresis， which may contribute to the hypocal-cemic (and hypophosphatemic) actions of calcitonin. Hence， a central role of calcitonin in regulating calcium metabolism in humans is not evident.**", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

In this case, Bodey J was clear in concluding that it was in the boy’s best interests to  删除换行 proceed with radiotherapy, given the evidence that his chances of survival would be drasti删除8：<u>￾</u>cally improved even at the risk of long term side effects, commenting that ‘one cannot enjoy  删除换行 even a diminished quality of life if one is not alive’.

In this case, greater  删除换行 importance was accorded to the rights of parents to decide their child’s treatment, given  删除换行 that a unit in Prague was willing to commence the alternative treatment immediately, even  删除换行 though it is not recommended in this country. As Baker J commented:\n\n【12】It is a fundamental principle of family law in this jurisdiction that responsibility for mak删除8：<u>￾</u>ing decisions about a child rests with his parents.

Her mother reports that she found an empty bottle of aspirin in the patient’s bedroom. Physical examination reveals a temperature of 38.6℃(101.5F)， a heart rate of 100/min， a respiratory rate of 40/min， and altered mental status. Arterial blood gas is notable for a pH of 7.28， partial carbon dioxide pressure (Pco，) of 25 mm Hg， and bicarbonate of 17 mEq/L. Her anion gap is 22 mEq/L. Salicylate levels arepending. Intravenous fluids are initiated， and charcoal and sodium bicarbonate are administered orallly. The patient is transferred to the intensive care unit for further stabilization.**\n\n【2】**What is the acid-base disturbance in this patient?**\n\n【3】A mixed metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis. The pH < 7.35 indicates acidemia. Respiratory acidosis is unlikely given the below-normal Pco， and the high anion gap. In this setting the low bicarbonate indicates metabolic acidosis. Applying Winter's formula (Pco，=(1.5x\\[HCO，\\])+8±2)， the appropriate respiratory compensation is Pco，=1.5通用删除7(英):<u>(17)</u>+8=33.5±2. The “compensation\" in this case is therefore excessive， suggesting an independent respiratory alkalotic process， which is consistent with a respiratory rate of 40/min.\n\n【4】**What are the causes and two main types of metabolic acidosis?**\n\n【5】Metabolic acidosis derives from the loss of bicarbonate or the retention of acid， leading to a non-anion gap acidosis in the former， and an anion gap acidosis in the latter. A non-anion gap acidosis is always the result of conditions that result in hyperchloremia (CI-> 109 mEq/L)， such as renal tubular acidosis. The excess chloride suppresses bicarbonate reabsorption. Metabolic acidosis that is caused by retention of acid results in an anion gap metabolic acidosis because unmeasured acidic anions are retained. To recall the major causes of anion gap metabolic acidosis， the mnemonic MUD PILES is useful (Methanol， Uremia， Diabetic ketoacidosis， Paraldehyde or Phenformin， Iron tablets or Isoniazid， Lactic acidosis， Ethylene glycol， Salicylates.)\n\n【6】**What are the causes of respiratory alkalosis?**\n\n【7】Anything that stimulates the central respiratory drive and causes hyperventilation， such as cerebrovascular accidents or neurologic disease， can cause respiratory alkalosis. Hypoxia， such as that caused by anemia， high altitudes， and pulmonary disease， can likewise increase respiratory rate and respiratory alkalosis. Other hyperventilatory states such as mechanical overventilation or voluntary hyperventilation， such as in cases of anxiety， can also be causative.\n\n【8】**How is anion gap calculated?**\n\n【9】The equation Nat - (CI-+HCO，-) is typically used. K\\* is typically not included because of its small contribution as a predominantly intracellular cation. A normal anion gap is 6-12 mEg/L. The presence of unmeasured anions， SsuucCrh as salicylates， displaces and reduces serum bicarbonate， thereby producing an apparently larger gap.\n\n【10】**What is the pathogenesis of this patient's condition?**\n\n【11】Aspirin is hydrolyzed to salicylate once ingested. At toxic levels， salicylates cause a primary respiratory alkalosis by stimulating the medullary respiratory center to hyperventilate. Salicylates also stimulate skeletal muscle metabolism， increasing oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production. This further stimulates hyperventilation. The metabolic acidosis component occurs because salicylates cause both lipolysis and uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation， resulting in the production of organic acids， pyruvate， and ketones.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

His condition is refractory to the usual psychiatric medication, and psychosurgery may reduce his potential for violence and make him less dangerous to himself and to others. The health care team thus hopes the intervention will provide more humane treatment than the prison-like incarceration to which he is currently subjected. However, given the history and grim connotation of lobotomy as well as its irreversibilty, it raises major issues of appropriate consultation and informed consent more than for any other treatment. These concerns continue to be at the forefront of ethical considerations in psychosurgical techniques and other functional psychiatric interventions, such as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT ).\n\n【4】##### Historical perspective\n\n【5】Psychosurgery has a controversial history, in which medical, moral, social, and political considerations intermingle. First described in 1936, and defined as a surgical ablation or destruction of nerve transmission pathways with the aim of modifying behavior, the conventional “lobotomy” of the 1940s and 1950s flourished. There was a strong desire to relieve over-population in asylums and hospitals, and lobotomy came to be seen as a means for calming down and even discharging an appreciable proportion of committed patients,通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>1 </sup></u> or of at least of making caring for them easier. Little attention was paid to patient selection and consent. The unrestrained application of lobotomy makes it difficult to this day to gain an objective evaluation of its true efficacy.\n\n【6】Almost immediately after its introduction, lobotomy was noted to have severe collateral effects on the patient’s personality and their emotional experience of the world. Caregivers described them as listless, dull, apathetic, without drive or initiative, passive, preoccupied and dependent. A horror among the public developed that the operation actually excised free will.\n\n【7】In 1948, Norbert Wiener remarked,\n\n【8】> Prefrontal lobotomy … has been recently been having a certain vogue, probably not unconnected with the fact that it makes the custodial care of many patients easier. Let me remark in passing that killing them makes their custodial care still easier. <sup>2</sup>\n\n【9】In 1950, physicians in the Soviet Union banned lobotomy, concluding that it was “contrary to the principles of humanity,” and that it “turned an insane person into an idiot.”通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>3 </sup></u> Notorious outcomes involving lobotomy, both in real life (e.g. Rosemary Kennedy and Rose Williams, sister of Tennessee Williams), as well as in fiction (e.g. Ken Kesey’s One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest ) perpetuated a horror of psychosurgical techniques.\n\n【10】After neuroleptics and chlorpromazine were discovered in the 1950s, psychosurgery declined rapidly, although it continued to be used in cases viewed as otherwise refractory to treatment. Following spirited social controversy in the US, a Federal commission was convened in 1977, which discredited growing public allegations claiming that psychosurgery was used to control minorities, restrict individual rights, and that its undesirable effects were nonethical. The Chairman of National Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research, even went so far as to declare:\n\n【11】> We have looked at the data and they did not support our prejudices. I, for one, did not expect to come out in favor of psychosurgery. But we saw that some very sick people had been helped by it … The operation should not be banned. <sup>4</sup>\n\n【12】Nevertheless, lobotomy was subsequently prohibited in a number of states in the US and in other countries such as Germany or Japan. Psychosurgery continues to be performed, but is strictly regulated and controlled in the US, Finland, Sweden, the UK, Spain, India, Belgium, and the Netherlands <sup>1 <span class=\"target\"></span></sup> .\n\n【13】##### Psychosurgery techniques\n\n【14】###### Conventional lobotomy\n\n【15】Prefrontal leucotomy – or “standard” prefrontal lobotomy – and transorbital leucotomy destroyed parts of the frontal lobes or their connections to the limbic system. Significant “frontal lobe” syndrome was a common complication, characterized by permanent apathy or euphoria, inconsistency, puerility, boorishness, impaired judgment, and chaotic behavior. Harmful side effects included epileptic seizures or aggressiveness.\n\n【16】###### Functional neurosurgery\n\n【17】Earlier techniques have since been abandoned in favor of much more limited – although still destructive – procedures. Grouped under the heading of “psychosurgery,” these procedures based on a “functional” neurosurgical approach are:\n\n【18】通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> anterior capsulotomy – interrupting frontothalamic connections in the internal capsule\n\n【19】通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> cingulotomy – partial destruction of the cingulate gyrus, altering certain connections within the limbic system\n\n【20】通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> subcaudate tractotomy – acting on the lower portion of the frontal cortex to destroy the fibres which connect it to the hypothalamus and the head of the caudate nucleus and\n\n【21】通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> bilimbic leucotomy – combining cingulotomy and subcaudate tractotomy.\n\n【22】Results are generally considered effective, although this is on the basis of small case series due to the paucity of acceptable indications. The severe cognitive behavioral disorders experienced by early lobotomy patients are no longer observed. More recently, the administration of highly focused gamma radiation (“gamma-knife”) has produced clinical results similar to functional neurosurgical techniques, while being minimally invasive.\n\n【23】###### Cerebral stimulation techniques\n\n【24】New hopes are arising for new, nondestructive techniques based on stereotaxic neurostimulation. Initially used to treat severe Parkinson’s disease, they appear to be comparatively free of complications, as there is no permanent cerebral damage. They achieve psychomodulation, even the equivalent of a reversible anterior capsulotomy, by inducing radiofrquency stimulation to the brain in specific locations of the cerebral parenchyma via implanted electrodes. Although very different from surgery mutilating the cerebral parenchyma, these stimulation techniques will probably always remain less psychologically and socially acceptable than, for instance, cardiac electrical pacing. However, because the patient is free to interrupt the neurostimulation, the voluntariness of the patient’s submission to treatment is preserved. In fact, these new treatments share many points in common with behavioral modification induced by pharmaceutical treatment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

She emphatically tells you, “I get out of breath when I do housework and I can’t even walk to the corner.” She has also noticed difficulty sleeping secondary to a dry cough that wakes her up at night and further exacerbation of her shortness of breath while lying flat. This has forced her to use three pillows for a good night’s sleep. She denies any chest pain, wheezing, or febrile illness. She has no past illnesses and takes no medications. She’s never smoked and drinks socially. On examination, her blood pressure is 187/90 mm Hg, her pulse is 97 beats/min, her respiratory rate is 16 breaths/min, her temperature is 98°F (36.6°C), and her oxygen saturation is 93% on room air by pulse oximetry. She has a pronounced jugular vein. Cardiac examination reveals a pansystolic murmur. Examination of her lung bases produces dullness bilaterally. You find 2+ pitting edema of both ankles. An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows a normal sinus rhythm and a chest x-ray demonstrates mild cardiomegaly with bilateral pleural effusions. You decide she needs further workup, so you call the hospital where you have admitting privileges and arrange for a telemetry bed.\n\n【3】 What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【4】 What is the next diagnostic step?\n\n【5】 What is the initial step in therapy?\n\n【6】### APPROACH TO:  \nCongestive Heart Failure\n\n【7】### DEFINITIONS\n\n【8】CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: Imbalance in pump function where the heart fails to maintain the circulation of blood adequately\n\n【9】FRAMINGHAM HEART STUDY: Large, prospective cohort study of the epidemiologic factors associated with cardiovascular diseases\n\n【10】### CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【11】CHF is divided into two main categories: systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Systolic dysfunction exists when there is a dilated left ventricle with impaired contractility. Diastolic dysfunction occurs in a normal or intact left ventricle that has an impaired ability to relax, fill, and eject blood. Table 27–1 lists the findings frequently associated with CHF.\n删除4：<u>Table 27–1 • ETIOLOGIES OF HEART FAILURE</u>\n\n【12】Dyspnea on exertion is the most sensitive symptom for the diagnosis of CHF, but its specificity is much lower. Other symptoms, which are common but less sensitive for the diagnosis, include dyspnea at rest, anxiety, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and cough productive of pink, frothy sputum. Nonspecific symptoms sometimes reported are weakness, lightheadedness, abdominal pain, malaise, wheezing, and nausea. Patients may have a medical history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, or other heart diseases (eg, cardiomyopathy, valvular disease). Histories of cigarette smoking and alcohol abuse may also be found.\n\n【13】#### _Etiologies_\n\n【14】The symptoms and signs that occur are unique and characteristic of the alterations to the normal physiologic function. Symptoms of right-sided heart failure include venous congestion, nausea/vomiting, distension/bloating, constipation, abdominal pain, and decreased appetite. Common signs of right-sided heart failure are fluid retention, weight gain, peripheral edema, JVD, hepatojugular reflux, hepatic ascites, and splenomegaly.\n\n【15】Left-sided heart failure manifests with pulmonary congestion, resulting in the symptoms of dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, wheezing, tachypnea, and cough. The signs of pulmonary congestion are bilateral pulmonary rales, S <sub>3 </sub> gallop rhythm, Cheyne-Stokes respiration, pleural effusion, and pulmonary edema. Pulmonary edema is often the first manifestation of congestive heart failure, but it can also be caused by a variety of noncardiac conditions .\n删除4：<u>Table 27–2 • NONCARDIAC CAUSES OF PULMONARY EDEMA</u>\n\n【16】Signs common to both left- and right-heart failure are tachycardia, cardiomegaly, cyanosis, oliguria, nocturia, and peripheral edema. Symptoms common to both include weakness, fatigue, confusion (delirium), decreased mental status, insomnia, decreased exercise tolerance, headache, stupor, coma, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and declining functional status.\n\n【17】After the Framingham Heart Study was reviewed, criteria were devised to help diagnose CHF by both signs and symptoms. Two major criteria or one major and two minor criteria can lead to a presumptive diagnosis of CHF. The major signs are paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, JVD, rales, cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema, S <sub>3 </sub> gallop, central venous pressure greater than 16 cm H <sub>2 </sub> O, circulation time of 25 seconds, hepatojugular reflex, and weight loss of 4.5 kg over 5 days of treatment. Minor criteria include bilateral ankle edema, nocturnal cough, dyspnea on exertion, hepatomegaly, pleural effusions, decreased vital capacity by one-third of maximum, and tachycardia.\n\n【18】#### _Epidemiology_\n\n【19】Of the general population between the ages of 50 and 59 years, 1% to 2% will have CHF, but that number increases to 6% to 10% in persons older than age 65. Approximately 30% to 40% of patients with CHF are hospitalized every year; it is the leading diagnosis-related group (DRG) among hospitalized patients older than age 65 years. The 5-year mortality rate remained essentially unchanged from 1971 to 1991, at 60% in men and 45% in women. Data from the Framingham Heart Study shows a median survival of 3.2 years for men and 5.4 years for women with CHF. The most common cause of death is progressive heart failure, but sudden death may account for up to 45% of all deaths. African Americans are 1.5 times more likely to die of CHF than are white people. Nevertheless, African-American patients appear to have similar or lower inhospital mortality rates than white patients. The prevalence is greater in men than in women for patients ages 40 to 75 years; after the age of 75, however, there is no difference.\n\n【20】#### _Evaluation_\n\n【21】After an initial assessment of the “ABCs”—airway, breathing, and circulation—patients presenting with dyspnea suggestive of heart failure should be evaluated with a history, physical examination, and focused testing. The testing should be designed to confirm CHF (or lead to an alternate diagnosis), identify a cause, and assess the severity of the disease. These initial tests should include blood tests, radiographic studies, electrocardiography, and echocardiography.\n\n【22】Initial blood tests should generally include a complete blood count (CBC), serum electrolytes, renal function tests, hepatic function tests, and cardiac enzymes. A high white blood cell count can help to identify the presence of an underlying infection, a common triggering event of CHF. Anemia is another common trigger of CHF. In an anemic patient, the oxygen-carrying ability of the blood is reduced. The cardiac output must increase to compensate for this. If the anemia is mild, or if the heart is normal, this compensation may occur without producing symptoms; if the anemia is severe or if there is underlying cardiac abnormality (from previous ischemia, hypertension, valvular abnormality, etc), heart failure may occur.\n\n【23】Electrolyte abnormalities are common in the presence of CHF. Neurohumoral responses to a failing heart result in water and sodium retention and potassium excretion. Severe heart failure can result in a dilutional hyponatremia. Medications used by patients with chronic heart disease (diuretics, ACE inhibitors, others) also can lead to electrolyte abnormalities. Increased vascular congestion can lead to passive congestion of the liver, resulting in increases in serum transaminases. Severe CHF can lead to jaundice as a consequence of impaired hepatic function caused by congestion. Serial measurement of cardiac enzymes is necessary to evaluate for the presence of acute myocardial infarction as the inciting event.\n\n【24】One of the neurohumoral responses to the presence of a failing ventricle is release of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP). The “Breathing Not Properly” study, published in 2004, showed that elevated levels of BNP and its prohormone (pro-BNP) can be used to assist in the diagnosis of CHF as a cause of acute dyspnea. Elevated levels of BNP and pro-BNP are a sensitive and specific marker for the diagnosis of CHF. In a dyspneic patient, a level of BNP less than 100 pg/mL suggests that the symptoms are unlikely to be caused by CHF; a BNP level greater than 500 pg/mL is consistent with the diagnosis of CHF.\n\n【25】ECG findings in CHF are variable. An ECG is useful to evaluate for evidence of acute ischemia or arrhythmia as cause of the CHF and can also reveal the presence of ventricular hypertrophy, often seen in chronic hypertension. Chest x-ray can also show cardiomegaly and cardiac chamber enlargement. Typically, the cardiothoracic ratio is greater than 50%. One of the earliest chest x-ray findings in CHF is cephalization of the pulmonary vasculature. As the failure progresses, interstitial pulmonary edema can be seen as perihilar infiltrates, often in a butterfly pattern. Pleural effusions can also be found. Effusions are usually bilateral but, if unilateral, are more often seen on the right hemithorax than the left.\n\n【26】Echocardiography is the gold-standard diagnostic modality in the presence of CHF . It may help to identify regional or global wall motion abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, ventricular or septal hypertrophy, and cardiac ejection fraction. It also can find cardiac tamponade, pericardial constriction, and pulmonary embolus. Echocardiography also is useful in identifying valvular stenosis or regurgitation, either of which can lead to heart failure. These findings aid in the determination of whether the heart failure is a systolic or diastolic dysfunction, an important distinction in the decision of appropriate treatment.\n\n【27】#### _Classification of CHF_\n\n【28】CHF severity is characterized by the symptoms a patient has and the degree that the symptoms limit a patient’s lifestyle. There are several classification systems in use; two of the most widely used are the New York Heart Association (NYHA) and the American Heart Association (AHA) classifications. Table 27–3 summarizes these systems. The classification of CHF is important in determining the appropriate treatment and prognosis for the patient.\n删除4：<u>Table 27–3 • CLASSIFICATION OF SEVERITY OF CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE</u>\n\n【29】#### _Management of Heart Failure_\n\n【30】In all cases of acute CHF, the initial management imperative is the “ABCs” —airway, breathing, and circulation. Supplemental oxygen, initially 100% via non-rebreather face mask, should be administered. If necessary, ventilation can be assisted with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), or mechanical ventilation. Cardiac and continuous pulse oximetry monitors should be placed and IV access obtained.\n\n【31】When acute pulmonary edema caused by CHF is diagnosed, the next step in management is the administration of a loop diuretic. Furosemide is generally the treatment of choice, both for its potent diuretic effect and for its rapid bronchial vasculature vasodilation. Nitrates, particularly nitroglycerin when given IV, reduce myocardial oxygen demand by reducing preload and afterload. Nitroglycerin also can rapidly reduce blood pressure and is the treatment of choice in a patient who has CHF and whose blood pressure is elevated. It should be used with caution or avoided in a hypotensive patient. IV morphine sulphate can be an effective adjunct to therapy. Along with its analgesic and anxiolytic properties, morphine is a venodilator (primary effect) and arterial dilator, resulting in a reduction in preload and an increase in cardiac output.\n\n【32】Most patients who present to the emergency department (ED) with symptomatic CHF will require admission to a telemetry unit for treatment and monitoring. Discharge criteria from the ED includes the gradual onset of symptoms, rapid resolution of symptoms with treatment, oxygen saturation of >90% on room air, and exclusion of an acute coronary syndrome as the cause of the CHF.\n\n【33】#### _Outpatient Management of CHF_\n\n【34】Patient education is an important aspect of the care for all patients with CHF. All patients should be advised about the importance of dietary sodium and fluid restriction. A normal American diet contains 6 to 10 g sodium chloride a day; initial restriction in patients with CHF should be 2 to 4 g/d. Stricter restrictions may be necessary in those with more severe disease. Overweight and obese patients should be counseled on appropriate caloric restrictions and encouraged to exercise to reduce weight. The importance of strict management of blood pressure and modification of other cardiac risk factors should be emphasized as well.\n\n【35】ACE inhibitors should be considered first-line therapy in patients with CHF and reduced left ventricular function. ACE inhibitors reduce preload, afterload, improve cardiac output, and inhibit tissue renin-angiotensin systems. The result of this is an improvement in symptoms and a reduction in mortality. ACE inhibitors can also delay the development of symptomatic CHF in asymptomatic patients with a reduced cardiac ejection fraction. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) can be used in place of an ACE inhibitor in a patient who does not tolerate an ACE inhibitor because of side effects (eg, cough).\n\n【36】ACE inhibitors are contraindicated in pregnancy, hypotension, hyperkalemia, and bilateral renal artery stenosis, and should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency.\n\n【37】For many years, the teaching was to avoid the use of β-blockers in the setting of CHF. However, more recent data support the use of β-blockers for both systolic and diastolic heart failure. The administration of β-blockers, especially in high doses, in the setting of acute CHF, can worsen symptoms; consequently, initial doses should be low and titrated up over several weeks. β-Blockers can reduce the sympathetic tone and the cardiac muscle remodeling associated with chronic heart failure. β-Blockers reduce mortality in patients with an ejection fraction of less than 35% and are primarily indicated in patients with NYHA Class II or III heart failure, or in patients with coronary artery disease.\n\n【38】Diuretics should be used to reduce fluid overload in both the acute and chronic settings. Loop diuretics (furosemide, bumetanide, torsemide, ethacrynic acid) can be used in all stages of CHF and are useful in pulmonary edema and refractory heart failure. Thiazide diuretics (hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone, others) are used in mild heart failure and may be used in combination with other diuretics in more severe CHF. Diuretic doses can be adjusted based on daily weight measurements by the patient.\n\n【39】The aldosterone antagonist spironolactone reduces mortality in advanced heart failure. It also functions as a diuretic and should be considered in NYHA Class III and IV heart failure. Patients on this medication must be closely monitored for the development of hyperkalemia, which can become profound and lead to arrhythmia.\n\n【40】Calcium channel blockers, in general, are contraindicated in systolic heart failure, because they increase mortality. The exception to this is the dihydropyri-dine calcium channel blocker amlodipine (Norvasc), which does not increase or decrease mortality. Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, vera-pamil) are useful in heart failure caused by diastolic dysfunction, as they promote increased cardiac output by lowering heart rate, which allows for more ventricular filling time.\n\n【41】Approximately one-third of patients with NYHA Class III or IV heart failure and reduced ejection fraction have ECG evidence of abnormal ventricular conduction (ie, prolonged QRS duration). These patients can be helped by promoting synchronous contraction of both the right and left ventricles using a biventricular pacemaker. This process, also known as cardiac resynchronization therapy , has been shown to reduce mortality and hospitalization in patients with symptomatic CHF in spite of maximal medical therapy.\n\n【42】###", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The Koi was housed with 20 other Koi in a 17,000-gallon pond. During the previous summer, the pond experienced an increase in nitrite concentration. This was followed by this Koi along with three others in the pond developing ulcerative skin lesions in the fall. The other three Koi died within a few weeks of onset of the ulcerative skin lesions. Necropsies performed on those fish revealed a diagnosis of _Aeromonas salmonicida_ infection (furun-culosis), according to the owner.

She has a history of atrial fibrillation for which she takes oral Coumadin. Over the last year, her International Normalized Ratio (INR) has ranged between 2.0 to 3.0. She has no other medical problems and takes no other medications. Her only new complaint is “forgetfulness.” Recently, she has had what she calls more “senior moments.” She occasionally forgets words and misplaces her keys. The forgetfulness does not interfere with her daily activities, and she continues to work part time in the volunteer office of a nearby hospital. She denies urinary incontinence, difficulty with walking or balance, changes in mood or appetite, weight changes, and problems with her vision. She does not drink alcohol. There are no significant findings on her physical and neurologic examinations. A depression screen is negative. All laboratory studies are within normal limits, including B12, folate, rapid plasma reagin (RPR), and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). She asks about gingko biloba, which a friend recommended taking to improve her memory.\n\n【3】 What is your response to gingko biloba?\n\n【4】 What is the best approach in discussing complementary or alternative medications with your patient?\n\n【5】### ANSWERS TO CASE 8:\n\n【6】#### Complementary, Alternative, and Integrative Medicine\n\n【7】_Summary_ : A 70-year-old woman is seen in your office for an annual visit. She has a history of atrial fibrillation and has been therapeutic on Coumadin over the previous year. Her only complaint is new forgetfulness. The workup is negative and her memory problems are likely a normal symptom of aging. She asks about taking gingko biloba.\n\n【8】 Response to gingko biloba : Advise her not to take gingko biloba, because of its possible interaction with warfarin. It is an herbal supplement sold over-the-counter. Many believe it can help with memory and cognition, but more research must be done, and there may be risks associated with its use. Gingko biloba may be associated with an increased risk of bleeding, especially in patients who are taking other anticoagulants such as warfarin.\n\n【9】 How to discuss complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) : Ask all patients if they use CAM during the comprehensive history in an open-minded manner. It is important to be open and nonjudgmental and understand the different reasons patients may use CAM.\n\n【10】### ANALYSIS\n\n【11】##### _Objectives_\n\n【12】1\\. Define complementary, alternative, and integrative medicines.\n\n【13】2\\. Describe effective ways to discuss and work with patients who wish to pursue nontraditional therapies.\n\n【14】3\\. Describe resources to find out scientific evidence and safety of various nontraditional therapies.\n\n【15】##### _Considerations_\n\n【16】This 70-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation for which she takes Coumadin asks about the use of gingko biloba to improve her memory. The most important first step is a comprehensive history, physical examination, and laboratory work-up to rule out reversible causes of dementia, such as hypothyroidism, B12 deficiency, and syphilis. Polypharmacy, depression, and normal pressure hydrocephalus can also cause similar symptoms in elderly patients. It can be difficult to distinguish memory loss that is a normal symptom of aging from non-reversible causes dementia, such as Alzheimer disease; however, if memory loss does not interfere with day-to-day functioning, as in this case, then it is more likely to be benign.\n\n【17】Once you determine that her memory problems are likely a common symptom of aging and not pathologic, it is important to provide reassurance and appear open and non-judgmental when answering her question about gingko biloba. Although many believe that gingko biloba may improve cognition and memory, there is still more research that needs to be done, particularly to determine the dose and length of treatment. Case studies have reported that gingko biloba may be associated with an increased risk of bleeding, particularly in patients taking other anticoagulants, such as warfarin. Therefore, in this case, the patient should be advised not to take gingko biloba, as the risks may outweigh the benefits.\n\n【18】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【19】#### Complementary, Alternative, and Integrative Medicine\n\n【20】### DEFINITIONS\n\n【21】ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE : Use of a nonmainstream approach in place of conventional medicine.\n\n【22】COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE : Use of a nonmainstream approach together with conventional medicine.\n\n【23】INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE : The practice of medicine that reaffirms the importance of the relationship between practitioner and patient, focuses on the whole person, is informed by evidence, and makes use of all appropriate therapeutic approaches, health care professionals, and disciplines to achieve optimal health and healing.\n\n【24】### CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【25】Complementary medicine is defined as the use of a nonmainstream approach together with conventional medicine. Alternative medicine is different in that it is the use of a nonmainstream approach in place of conventional medicine. In the United States, alternative medicine is less common than complementary medicine. Integrative medicine focuses on the whole person, not just the disease, emphasizes the relationship between patient and physician, is informed by evidence, and makes use of all possible therapeutic approaches, practitioners, and disciplines to achieve optimal health and healing.\n\n【26】In a National Health Interview Survey from 2002, 75% of American adults reported having used CAM at some time. Patients more likely to use CAM were women, those with a higher education, and those who had been hospitalized within the last year. The reasons for using CAM varied, but more than one-half of the adult patients who used CAM believed that CAM combined with conventional medical treatments would help. Less than one-third believed conventional therapies would not help them. Thirteen percent felt conventional medicine was too expensive.\n\n【27】### ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION\n\n【28】##### _What Are the Most Common Complementary Health Approaches?_\n\n【29】The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine divides the therapies into 2 subgroups, that is, mind and body practices and natural products. The most commonly used mind and body practices among adults are deep breathing, meditation, chiropractic and osteopathic, massage, yoga, progressive relaxation, and guided imagery. Other practices include movement therapies, Tai chi and qi gong, healing touch, and hypnotherapy. Natural products include herbs, vitamins, minerals, and probiotics, which are sold over the counter as dietary supplements. According to the 2007 National Health Interview Survey, the most common natural product used by adults was fish oil/omega 3. Although 17.7% of American adults had used a nonvitamin/nonmineral natural product in the previous year, research to prove they are safe and effective is still ongoing. It is especially important to consider potential interactions, as some patients fail to report use of natural products to their physicians.\n\n【30】##### _Ginkgo biloba_\n\n【31】Gingko biloba is a medicinal herb sold over-the-counter in the United States. Many believe it can improve memory and cognition. Although more studies must be performed to identify the diseases and symptoms for which it is most useful, as well as the ideal dose and duration of treatment, it is thought to be beneficial in age-associated dementia, Alzheimer disease, and vascular dementia. Possible mechanisms of action include improving cerebral blood flow, reducing reperfusion injury, inhibiting platelets, and various neuroprotective processes such as antioxidation and antiinflammation. Although gingko biloba is sold over-the-counter, its use is not without risks. Case studies report unusual bleeding in patients taking gingko biloba. The risk of bleeding seems to be higher in patients taking other antiplatelet drugs, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), aspirin, and anticoagulants, possibly secondary to the inhibition of platelet-activating factor due to gingko use.\n\n【32】Notably, gingko biloba is not the only herbal supplement thought to have potential interactions with warfarin. Many recommend that patients taking warfarin avoid gingko biloba, garlic, ginger, and ginseng.\n\n【33】##### _Communicating With Patients_\n\n【34】Speaking with patients about CAM can be difficult for physicians, as CAM includes medical interventions not typically covered in the curriculum of many US medical schools. Before initiating a discussion about CAM, physicians should consider why patients utilize these therapies. Reasons may include a desire for more control over their medical care, to enhance quality of life, and to boost the immune system. Other patients turn to CAM because they are dissatisfied with attitudes of physicians and feel conventional therapies have failed. Interestingly, patients who use CAM commend CAM providers on the time spent with patients, the way they explain illnesses, the continuity in care, and the personalization of care. Patient satisfaction with CAM may not correspond with improvements in symptoms, which means that patients respond to more than just the treatment itself.\n\n【35】There are multiple reasons patients may not initiate a conversation with their physician about CAM. Patients may be afraid of being judged or not want their physician to think they are ungrateful for the care they have received. Other patients may not understand that CAM can interact with biomedical treatments or that withholding information about its use from their physician can be dangerous.\n\n【36】Physicians have their own reasons for not initiating discussions about CAM. For some physicians, it is a lack of knowledge on the subject and a fear of appearing uniformed. Others may not believe that CAM can help their patients.\n\n【37】One way that physicians may talk to their patients about the use of CAM is to make it part of the comprehensive history, along with asking about the use of drugs and alcohol. Asking patients what medications they use at home is not sufficient, as many patients do not consider CAM as medication. One way to approach the topic is to ask, “Are you taking anything else, such as vitamins, herbs, or homeopathic remedies? Have you tried any other practices, such as acupuncture or yoga?” It is important for physicians to appear nonjudgmental and supportive. In addition to facilitating a discussion about CAM, providers should review issues of safety and efficacy and follow-up with patients to review the response to therapy and monitor for adverse effects. It is also important to document these interactions. This strategy helps both patients and physicians integrate CAM into their conventional medical therapy, which may help avoid potential and serious interactions.\n\n【38】##### _Resources_\n\n【39】The Internet has a wealth of information on CAM for both patients and physicians. When reviewing a website before recommending it to a patient, check who runs the website, if they are selling a product, and if the information is evidence based and up to date.

He says that his illness has been worsening over the past 2 weeks. He originally had dyspnea on exertion and now is short of breath at rest. On questioning, he tells you that he lives in a homeless shelter when he can, but he frequently sleeps on the streets. He has used IV drugs (primarily heroin) “on and off” for many years. He denies medical history but the only time he gets medical attention is when he comes to the ED for an illness or injury. On review of systems, he complains of fatigue, weight loss, and diarrhea. On examination, he is a thin, disheveled man appearing much older than his stated age. His temperature is 100.5°F (38.0°C), his blood pressure is 100/50 mm Hg, his pulse is 105 beats/min, and his respiratory rate is 24 breaths/min. His initial oxygen saturation is 89% on room air, which comes up to 94% on 4 L of oxygen by nasal cannula. Significant findings on examination include dry mucous membranes, a tachycardic but regular cardiac rhythm, a benign abdomen, and generally wasted-appearing extremities. His pulmonary examination is significant for tachypnea and fine crackles bilaterally, but no visible signs of cyanosis. His chest x-ray is read by the radiologist as having diffuse, bilateral, interstitial infiltrates that look like “ground glass.”\n\n【3】 What is the most likely cause of this patient’s current pulmonary complaints?\n\n【4】 What underlying illness does this patient most likely have?\n\n【5】 What testing and treatment should be started now?\n\n【6】### ANSWERS TO CASE 45:  \nHIV and AIDS\n\n【7】_Summary:_ A 39-year-old, homeless, IV drug abuser is seen with fever, cough, dyspnea, and fatigue. He is found to be tachypneic, febrile, and hypoxemic. His chest x-ray reveals bilateral interstitial infiltrates.\n\n【8】• Most likely cause of current illness: _Pneumocystis jiroveci_ (formerly known as _Pneumocystis carinii_ ) pneumonia.\n\n【9】• Most probable underlying illness: AIDS.\n\n【10】• Recommended current testing and treatment: Complete blood count (CBC), electrolytes, arterial blood gas; HIV enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with confirmatory Western blot; CD4 cell count; HIV RNA assay; sputum for _P jiroveci_ ; start treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and consider starting highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with appropriate case management including intensive drug abuse treatment, counseling, and social work.\n\n【11】### ANALYSIS\n\n【12】#### _Objectives_\n\n【13】1\\. Know the common risks and modes of transmission of HIV/AIDS.\n\n【14】2\\. Be aware of common presentations of persons infected with HIV.\n\n【15】3\\. Learn the role of antiretroviral therapy and other adjunctive treatments in the chronic management of HIV and AIDS.\n\n【16】4\\. Be able to identify common complications and opportunistic infections associated with HIV/AIDS.\n\n【17】#### _Considerations_\n\n【18】The case described is that of a 39-year-old man who is homeless and an intravenous drug user. He has had fatigue and weight loss. He now presents with fever, tachypnea, and hypoxemia. It is likely that he is infected with HIV, and has _P jiroveci_ pneumonia. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infects the helper T cells of the immune system, which are defined by the presence of the cell-signaling protein CD4, and causes a decline in both their number and their effectiveness. This decline in functional helper T cells disables the cell-mediated arm of the immune system and leaves the body vulnerable to infection from multiple opportunistic organisms. This advanced stage of the HIV infection, in which such opportunistic infections occur, is known as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).\n\n【19】_Pneumocystis jiroveci_ (formerly known as _P carinii_ ) pneumonia is an AIDS-defining illness in someone infected with HIV. _P jiroveci_ is a fungus that may colonize many people, but typically causes disease only in those with profound immune deficiencies, such as AIDS infections or cancers treated with chemotherapy. _P jiroveci_\n\n【20】pneumonia usually presents with nonproductive cough, fever, and dyspnea that worsens over a few days to a few weeks. Patients usually are found to be febrile, tachypneic, and hypoxic, although their lung examination may be unremarkable (other than tachypnea). The presence of a bilateral interstitial infiltrate on chest x-ray, often described as having a ground-glass appearance, is classic for _P jiroveci_ pneumonia. The identification of the organism in sputum, either spontaneously produced or induced, is diagnostic, but treatment is usually started prior to definitive diagnosis in those with a classic clinical picture.\n\n【21】As _P jiroveci_ pneumonia occurs after the CD4 count has markedly reduced, patients often will have symptoms and signs of other AIDS-related complications as well. It is common to see oral or esophageal candidiasis, diarrhea, Kaposi sarcoma, wasting syndrome, and other complications in a patient presenting with _P jiroveci_ pneumonia. Although it presents in the setting of advanced disease, _P jiroveci_ pneumonia remains a common presenting illness in those who did not know that they were infected with HIV and is a frequent initial opportunistic infection in those with known HIV disease. The incidence of _P jiroveci_ pneumonia is decreasing in the United States with more widespread awareness of HIV disease, broader usage of antiretroviral therapy, and prophylactic use of TMP-SMX in patients with CD4 count of less than 200 cells/µL.\n\n【22】### APPROACH TO:  \nHIV and AIDS\n\n【23】### DEFINITIONS\n\n【24】ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY SYNDROME (AIDS): This advanced stage of the HIV infection, in which such opportunistic infections occur with specific criteria for its designation.\n\n【25】HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV): A retrovirus that infects the helper T cells of the immune system, which are defined by the presence of the cell-signaling protein CD4, and causes a decline in both their number and their effectiveness.\n\n【26】### CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【27】#### _Epidemiology_\n\n【28】Over 33 million people in the world are living with HIV infection. It is estimated that more than 2 million people die from AIDS every year, with a disproportionate share of the deaths occurring in sub-Saharan Africa. HIV disease is caused by the human retroviruses, HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is more common worldwide, whereas HIV-2 has been reported in western Africa, Europe, South America, and Canada.\n\n【29】In the United States, 1.2 million people are estimated to be infected with HIV, with approximately 25% unaware of their infection . The highest prevalence of HIV occurs in men who have sex with other men and in IV drug users, although the occurrence in heterosexual sexual contact is increasing. African Americans are disproportionately affected with infection, both in total numbers of cases and in development of new infections.\n\n【30】#### _Transmission_\n\n【31】HIV is transmitted from person to person through contact with infected blood and body fluids . Sexual contact is the most common mechanism of transmission and, while anal intercourse has the highest rate of transmission, HIV can be acquired through vaginal and oral intercourse as well. The risk of HIV transmission is also increased by the presence of genital or anal lesions caused by other sexually transmitted diseases, such as gonorrhea and genital herpes. The risk of transmission can be reduced by the proper and consistent use of latex condoms (either male or female condoms). Because HIV can pass through lambskin condoms, these are not recommended. Circumcision has also been shown to decrease the rate of HIV transmission.\n\n【32】Because of the large amount of undiagnosed HIV infections, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2006 expanded screening recommendations, which are summarized in Table 45–1 .\n删除4：<u>Table 45–1 • CDC HIV SCREENING RECOMMENDATIONS</u>\n\n【33】Sharing needles by IV drug users is the second most common source of transmission of HIV. Vertical transmission from an infected woman to her baby has been found to occur during pregnancy, during the process of delivery of a baby, and from breast-feeding. Blood and blood-product transfusions have been linked to infection, although the routine screening of donor blood for HIV now makes this an extremely rare event.\n\n【34】Health-care workers have been infected with HIV through accidental punctures with needles used on HIV-infected patients. There is also a risk of infection by infected blood entering through open skin wounds or mucous membranes. The risk of transmission to health-care workers is low and is related to the viral load of the patient, the amount of blood to which the worker is exposed, and the depth of the inoculum. Postexposure risk of developing HIV infection can be reduced by immediate and careful cleaning of the exposure/puncture site along with postexposure prophylactic (PEP) treatment with antiretroviral therapy. Postexposure prophylaxis should ideally be started within 2 hours after the exposure and should only be used when exposure to HIV-contaminated blood is likely. Although animal models limit the usefulness of PEP to 36 hours, there is no defined time limit before starting medications. The currently recommended length of PEP is 4 weeks.\n\n【35】HIV has been measured in small amounts in saliva and tears of HIV-infected patients, but no cases of transmission based on exposure to these have been documented. Transmission has been reported to occur in bite wounds from infected individuals, but only when significant tissue damage and bleeding has occurred. Measurable amounts of HIV have not been found in sweat. No case of HIV has been documented to have occurred via an insect vector.\n\n【36】#### _Primary Infection_\n\n【37】Following initial exposure to HIV, some patients will complain of nonspecific symptoms, such as low-grade fever, fatigue, sore throat, or myalgias. This illness typically occurs 6 to 8 weeks following the infection and is self-limited. The primary infection is also known as acute seroconversion syndrome, as the symptoms are thought to be related to the development of antibodies to the virus.\n\n【38】Following the resolution of the primary infection symptoms (if any occur), there is a period of clinical latency. During this time, most infected persons are asymptomatic, although some may have lymphadenopathy. This period can last from 6 months to 10 years following the transmission of the virus. However, while the patient is asymptomatic during this period, a relentless decline in helper T-cell number and immune function usually occurs in the untreated patient, with the result that many patients initially present with profound immunodeficiency and opportunistic infections.\n\n【39】#### _Clinical Categorization of HIV/AIDS Infections_\n\n【40】The CDC defines four clinical stages for adults aged >13.\n\n【41】Stage 1. CD4 cell count >500 cells/µL or percentage of total lymphocytes >29\n\n【42】Stage 2. CD4 cell count of 200 to 499 cells/µL or percentage between 14 and 28\n\n【43】Stage 3. (AIDS) CD4 cell count <200 cells/µL or percentage <14 and documentation of AIDS-defining condition \n删除4：<u>Table 45–2 • SOME EXAMPLES OF HIV-RELATED CONDITIONS THAT ARE NOT AIDS DEFINING</u>\n删除4：<u>Table 45–3 • EXAMPLES OF AIDS-DEFINING CONDITIONS</u>\n\n【44】Stage 4. Unknown laboratory parameters with an AIDS-defining condition\n\n【45】For classification purposes, a patient’s HIV is defined by the highest clinical stage in which the patient has ever qualified .\n\n【46】#### _Diagnostic Evaluation_\n\n【47】The standard screening test for HIV infection is the detection of HIV antibodies using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Samples that are repeatedly positive on ELISA testing must be confirmed by Western blot testing . The Western blot test is an electrophoresis that detects antibodies to HIV antigens of specific molecular weights.\n\n【48】When HIV is diagnosed, a complete history and physical examination should be performed. Emphasis should be placed on identifying comorbid conditions, determining the presence of AIDS-defining conditions, reducing risky behaviors, and assisting with coping strategies. HIV is reportable to local health authorities, but partner notification laws vary by state , so it is important to know the local regulations.\n\n【49】Before instituting therapy, laboratory testing should include HIV genotype testing to identify strains that may be resistant to therapy. HIV RNA levels can help to assess disease activity. CD4 lymphocyte counts should be measured at baseline and, generally, every 3 to 6 months thereafter to monitor for disease staging, progression, and the risk of complications. A complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel, and urinalysis should be performed at baseline and periodically thereafter to monitor for complications of HIV and of the medications that are used in treatment. Serology for toxoplasmosis and cytomegalovirus should also be obtained to identify organisms at risk for reactivation following immunosuppression.\n\n【50】Screening for other sexually transmitted diseases (syphilis, hepatitis B and C, gonorrhea, chlamydia) should be performed initially and repeated, if needed, because of any ongoing risks identified. Hepatitis B and A vaccination should be offered to those who lack immunity. A purified protein derivative (PPD) test should be done, and if initially negative, repeated annually. However, a PPD may be falsely negative if the patient is very immunosuppressed or very ill. Women should have regular Papanicolaou (Pap) smears to evaluate for cervical dysplasia or cancer.\n\n【51】#### _Late Disease_\n\n【52】HIV and the opportunistic infections it allows affect every organ system in the body. Some infections, such as tuberculosis and pneumococcal pneumonia, also affect healthy people but are greatly increased in incidence and severity in the presence of HIV. Many mildly pathologic organisms, such as _Candida_ , cause unusual, severe infections in parts of the body, such as the esophagus and lungs, which they would rarely if ever affect without coinfection with HIV. Moreover, some AIDS-defining conditions, such as Kaposi sarcoma, can occur at normal T-cell counts while other infections, such as cytomegalovirus retinitis and cryptococcal meningitis, are only seen in the presence of extreme immunodeficiency and very low T-cell counts. Many cancers are common in HIV-positive people, some of which, such as cervical carcinoma, are found in the non–HIV-infected population while others, such as primary CNS lymphoma, are extremely rare outside of the HIV infected. Moreover, HIV infection damages the body directly and leads to such conditions as HIV-related dementia and HIV-associated nephropathy. Without antiretroviral therapy, AIDS is a universally fatal disease.\n\n【53】#### _Treatment_\n\n【54】Because of the complexity of treatment regimens and frequently changing treatment guidelines, patients with HIV/AIDS should be referred, in almost all cases, to a physician with expertise in treating these conditions . In general, antiretroviral therapy is used in patients who have AIDS (by laboratory or clinical criteria), who have symptoms of disease, or who are pregnant (to reduce the risk of vertical transmission). Updated guidelines on HIV/AIDS treatment and monitoring can be obtained by going to 删除9：<u>http://www.aidsinfo.nih.gov</u> .\n\n【55】Prophylactic treatments to reduce the risk of infection are also important in immunosuppressed patients. HIV patients should receive annual influenza vaccination and should be offered pneumococcal vaccination (preferably before the CD4 count falls to less than 200 cells/µL). Live virus vaccines are contraindicated in both HIV patients and their close (household) contacts . Prophylaxis against _P jiroveci_ pneumonia should be instituted using TMP-SMX when the CD4 count falls to less than 200 cells/µL or if there is a history of oropharyngeal candidiasis. _Mycobacterium avium–_ intracellulare complex prophylaxis, using azithromycin or clarithromycin, is recommended if the CD4 count falls to less than 50 cells/µL.\n\n【56】###", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

He has a probable history of gallstones and is now febrile  删除换行 and Murphy’s sign positive on examination.\n\n【11】Most patients with gallstones are asymptomatic. However, complications of gallstones range  删除换行 from biliary colic, whereby gallstones irritate or temporarily block the biliary tract, to acute  删除换行 cholecystitis, which is an infection of the gallbladder sometimes due to obstruction of the  删除换行 cystic duct. Gallstones can also become trapped in the common bile duct (choledocholithia删除8：<u>￾</u>sis) causing jaundice and potential ascending cholangitis, which refers to infection of the bili删除8：<u>￾</u>ary tree. Ascending cholangitis classically presents with Charcot’s triad of fever, right upper  删除换行 quadrant (RUQ) pain and jaundice. It can be life-threatening.\n\n【12】The majority of gallstones contain cholesterol but some contain pigment. Risk factors include  删除换行 pregnancy, elderly, obesity, haemolytic blood conditions (e.g. sickle cell disease, hereditary  删除换行 elliptocytosis) and certain ethnic groups (Hispanics, northern Europeans).\n\n【13】Biliary colic typically presents with wave-like RUQ or epigastric pain radiating to the back  删除换行 and is associated with nausea that starts after a heavy or fatty meal or at night. The patient  删除换行 moves around to get comfortable, as opposed to a peritonitic patient who lies still. The pain is  删除换行 usually self-resolving. The pain associated with acute cholecystitis is similar but lasts longer \n\n【14】(>6 hours) and is usually associated with fever.\n\n【15】Murphy’s sign is a sensitive examination sign for acute cholecystitis. Place your hand below  删除换行 the right costal margin in the RUQ and ask the patient to deeply inspire. If the gallbladder is  删除换行 inflamed, the patient will ‘catch their breath’ and experience pain.\n\n【16】Patients with epigastric or RUQ pain require a full blood count, renal and electrolyte screen删除8：<u>￾</u>ing, liver function tests (LFT), serum calcium and amylase/lipase level to rule out pancreati删除8：<u>￾</u>tis. In women of child-bearing age, a pregnancy test and urinalysis are vital. In biliary colic,  删除换行 the blood tests are usually normal, but in acute cholecystitis, there may be a leukocytosis and \n\n【17】LFT derangement.\n\n【18】Jaundice does not occur in biliary colic and is not a common feature of acute cholecystitis. Its  删除换行 presence should raise suspicion for choledocholithiasis or Mirizzi syndrome whereby a gallstone  删除换行 in Hartmann’s pouch or the cystic duct causes external compression of the bile duct.\n\n【19】The first-line investigation of choice for biliary colic or cholecystitis is ultrasonagraphy. This  删除换行 is quick and non-radiative (useful in children and pregnancy), and has a sensitivity of over  删除换行 90%. It can also evaluate other causes of abdominal pain including the pancreas, liver, aorta  删除换行 and kidneys. The common features in cholecystitis are gallbladder wall thickening, disten删除8：<u>￾</u>tion and pericholecystic fluid. CT scanning of the abdomen is only indicated in diagnostic  删除换行 uncertainty. CT scanning does not identify gallstones that are isodense to bile, and so may  删除换行 provide false negative results.\n\n【20】Biliary colic requires supportive therapy in the form of adequate analgesia and anti-emetics,  删除换行 but does not require antibiotics. The patient should be counseled on dietary modification \n\n【21】(avoiding fatty food and heavy meals). The patient should be referred to a general surgeon on  删除换行 an outpatient basis for consideration of a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.\n\n【22】Acute cholecytitis requires antibiotic therapy and admission under general surgery, who  删除换行 should decide whether to perform a ‘hot’ emergency cholecystectomy within 24–72 hours  删除换行 of admission. This shortens the hospital stay but can be associated with more surgical 201\n\n【23】Case 57: Upper abdominal pain 删除换行 complications. Surgery may be indicated in cholecystitis complications including a perfo删除8：<u>￾</u>rated gallbladder causing peritonism or an empyema. Most patients will undergo an elective  删除换行 laparoscopic cholecystectomy once the inflammation has resolved.\n\n【24】Key Points\n\n【25】• Acute cholecystitis is associated with RUQ pain (>6 hours), fever and a positive \n\n【26】Murphy’s sign on examination.\n\n【27】• Ultrasonography of the abdomen and pelvis is the first-line investigation for gall删除8：<u>￾</u>stone disease.\n\n【28】• Management of acute cholecystitis includes antibiotics, fluids and dietary  删除换行 modification.删除9：<u>http://taylorandfrancis.com203</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Reactions to food substances are quite common， and not all relate to allergy， which is an adverse reaction that involves the immune system. The term intolerance is preferred when an adverse reaction shows no evidence of immune system involvement. Examples of intolerance include lactose intolerance (related to a primary or secondary deficiency of intestinal lactase) which produces bloating and loose explosive stools in infants and children.**\n\n【38】**Pharmacological food intolerance can also be seen - examples include tyramine in strong cheese and caffeine in coffee， both of which can induce adverse reactions in children 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>.**\n\n【39】**Common allergies include milk， eggs， peanut， soy， wheat， tree nuts (such as walnuts and cashews)， fish and shellfish. The example used in this above is an infant with egg allergy though a similar presentation could occur with any of these food types. Infants with cow’s milk protein allergy can sometimes present， especially in early infancy， with a haemorrhagic colitis (non IgE mediated reaction)， either because the infant is formula fed， or more rarely breast fed by a mother consuming cow's milk in her diet (human milk can contain cow's milk protein). Allergy such as this can be more difficult to diagnose， as skin testing or specific IgE analysis may be negative or equivocal， so that diagnosis will rest on history and dietary trials.**\n\n【40】**Anaphylaxis is a severe， life-threatening， generalised hypersensitivity reaction， characterised by rapidly developing，life-threatening problems involving： the airway， breathing and/or circulation. In most cases， there are associated skin and mucosal changes 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u>. The criteria for diagnosing an anaphylactic reaction are outlined in .**\n\n【41】**Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any 1 of the following 3 criteria is fulfilled following exposure to an allergen：**\n\n【42】**1\\.

Adapted from Kim & Fischer， 2011**\n\n【50】**In the first question the pruritus and swollen lips are part of the skin/mucosal involvement whilst the vomiting is not described as being persistent. The extreme pallor signifies circulatory collapse and would indicate hypotension occurring as part of an anaphylactic response.**\n\n【51】**The most important and immediate intervention in this child needs to be dietary intervention， with immediate removal of all foods containing even traces of egg from the diet， under the supervision of a paediatric dietician. Allergy testing may show up other possible food allergies， so that at a later date，**\n\n【52】**other food substances may also need to be removed from the diet， but this should only be undertaken with paediatric dietetic intervention and advice， and only if there is not substantial clinical improvement of the infant's eczema with removal of egg from the diet. Complete removal of egg should only be for a specific period (perhaps until the child's second birthday) when attempts should be made to induce tolerance to egg by gradual re-introduction of egg back into the diet， starting with traces of egg in cooked food products. Other interventions including antihistamines and topical steroids may well be necessary if the child's eczema remains very troublesome， but should not be introduced immediately whilst awaiting any possible response of the eczema to the initial dietary intervention. It is common to find cow's milk allergy along with egg allergy. However an egg free diet combined with a cow's milk protein free diet is complex and difficult to initiate， and would only be done if allergy testing suggested significant milk allergy， and response to an egg free diet was disappointing. It is also clearly possible that further accidental egg administration in this infant could induce anaphylaxis. There may therefore be a need for an adrenaline (epinephrine) pen prescription at some point in the near future， but in a 13 month old child， an egg free diet should be possible to maintain with the supervision and understanding of carers， and there should be no need for prescription of a pen as part of immediate therapeutic intervention.**\n\n【53】**When investigating food allergies， skin prick testing will give more directly relevant information about the degree of sensitivity of the child to a particular allergen than specific blood IgE testing (previously termed RAST IgE or immunoCAP). Specific blood IgE measurements， although predictive of allergy 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u>， can give an elevated result without the patient having any symptoms， and the level of specific IgE to that allergen has little bearing on the clinical level of sensitivity or the likelihood of future anaphylaxis. The size of a skin prick wheal when testing may have some relationship to the degree of allergy (although this is controversial). The problem with skin prick testing is that it requires an area of skin relatively unaffected by eczema. and occasionally therefore cannot be undertaken if there is generalised florid eczema， nor can it be undertaken if the infant has recently been given antihistamines. IgG blood testing for egg has no proven value， and should not be undertaken. Patch testing is reserved for testing for contact dermatitis， and would rarely be undertaken in infants 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u>. An oral challenge test (undertaken in a controlled hospital environment) could potentially be dangerous， and with this history is not indicated unless all allergy tests subsequently proved negative.**\n\n【54】**Tolerance to many foods tends to improve with age in food allergic children， the exceptions being peanut and crustacean/shellfish. In one review paper， 80% of children who had been cow's milk intolerant developed tolerance by 5 years， with egg it was 66% by age 7 years， soya， 69% by 10 years and wheat65% by 12 years 通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u>.

His blood pressure is normal， as is his heart rate and other vital signs. On examination， the patient has clear lungs and a normal cardiac exam-ination. Auscultation of the carotid arteries reveals a “whooshing sound”(bruits) bilaterally. There is evidence of slurred speech and left-sided facial droop. The patient is diagnosed with a stroke.

This allows capillaries to exchange substances across the capillary wall.**\n\n【11】Reynolds number： Predicts whether blood flow will be laminar or turbulent (the more elevated Reynolds number， the more turbulent the flow). This number is increased with increased blood velocity， which in this case is because of narrowed vessels.\n\n【12】**CLINICAL CORRELATION**\n\n【13】**This patient has a classic presentation of a stroke probably resulting from ath-erosclerotic disease affecting the carotid arteries. The first step， as in address-ing any patient， is to examine the ABCs (airway， breathing， circulation). Reversing any ischemia， correction of severe hypertension but not overcorrec-tion， and oxygenation are the important principles. Strokes may be caused by ischemia (decreased oxygen delivery) resulting from arterial thrombosis (clot) or embolization (clot breaks off and lodges distally) or by hemorrhage (blood collection in the brain putting pressure on the normal brain cells). The CT scan helps in assessing for hemorrhagic stroke. Some patients are candidates for thrombolytic therapy when hemorrhagic stroke is ruled out. After stabilization， carotid ultrasound studies probably will be performed， perhaps followed， if carotid insufficiency is confirmed， by carotid endarterectomy.**\n\n【14】**Calculating and understanding cardiovascular hemodynamics are of utmost importance in clinically assessing patients. Pressure in the large conducting arteries such as the carotid normally is high compared with other vessels. These vessels normally offer little resistance to blood flow. When there is nar-rowing of a vessel， as in this case of peripheral vascular disease， resistance increases because of the narrowing and the change in flow from laminar to tur-bulent. Because of the increased resistance， blood flow to the tissues that the vessel supplies decreases. Blood flow to peripheral tissues also can be com-promised by a decrease in pressure in the large conducting arteries. Rapid assessment of mean arterial pressure (MAP) can determine whether a patient**\n\n【15】**is in shock and if vital organs such as the brain are perfused. As patients age， various hemodynamic changes occur， such as decreased arterial capacitance， which in turn can increase systolic blood pressure (systolic hypertension) and increase pulse pressure. Veins offer little resistance to blood flow but have the highest proportion of blood in the system. When a patient becomes hypov-olemic， the adrenergic receptors are stimulated， causing constriction of the veins and thus limiting the decrease in venous return to the heart and the decrease in cardiac output.**\n\n【16】**APPROACHTO HEMODYNAMIC PHYSIOLOGY**\n\n【17】**Objectives**\n\n【18】**1Know the components of the vascular system.2**\n\n【19】**Know and be able to use the relationship among pressure， flow， and resistance.**\n\n【20】**3\\.

In this case， only the systemic system will be considered. This system is com-posed of a number of large conducting arteries such as the aorta and the carotids that subdivide multiple times until they give rise to the arterioles. With each subdivision， the radius of each individual vessel decreases， but the number of vessels in each subdivision increases dramatically， going from one aorta to tens of millions of arterioles. Each arteriole then feeds many capil-laries. Physiologically， the focal point of this system is the billions of capil-laries that function to bring each cell of the body to within a few microns of flowing blood so that exchange of substrates between the cells and the blood can take place. On the other end of the capillaries are the venules， which are about equal in number to the arterioles but are larger in diameter. The venules coalesce multiple times until they give rise to the vena cava.**\n\n【27】The number and size of the vessels in each division markedly affect both the resistance to flow and the velocity of flow of blood in each division. The resistance to blood flow in any single vessel is inversely proportional to its radius taken to the power of 4. Thus， a halving of the radius increases\n\n【28】**resistance 16 times. Conversely， the resistance offered by any division of ves-sels is inversely proportional to the number of vessels in that division because these vessels are arranged parallel to one another. Thus， the greater the num-ber of vessels， the lower is the resistance. In the systemic circulation， this bal-ance between vessel radius and vessel number is such that the small arteries. the capillaries， and， most important， the arterioles offer the greatest resistance to blood flow.**\n\n【29】The velocity of blood flow through the vessels of any division depends on the volume of blood flow per unit of time (milliliters per second) and the com-bined cross-sectional area of all the vessels that constitute that division. Thus\n\n【30】Because all the divisions of the systemic circulation are in series with one another， the volume of blood flow per unit time (Q) will be the same through all divisions. However， velocity of flow will differ because the combined cross-sectional area of the vessels in each division will vary. The situation in the systemic circulation is such that the peak flow velocity is highest in the large conducting arteries and lowest in the capillaries. The low flow veloc-ity in the capillaries allows time for exchange to take place between the cells of the body and the blood. The high velocity of flow in the large arteries is nor-mally of little consequence. However， velocity can be increased in vessels that are partially occluded (thus decreasing cross-sectional area)， as in this case， to the point where flow changes from laminar to turbulent. The conditions that produce clinically audible turbulent flow are expressed in the Reynolds equation：\n\n【31】**which solves for the Reynolds number (Re) when D is the diameter of the vessel， v is the velocity of flow， p is fluid density， and n is fluid viscosity. The larger the Reynolds number， the more likely there is to be turbulent flow； and so the greater the velocity， the more likely there is to be turbulence. Turbulent flow is significant because it offers more resistance and produces clinically audible sounds termed bruits. The flow of blood through a vascular bed such as the central nervous system (CNS) depends not only on the resist-ance to flow but also on the pressure that is driving the flow. In a normal per-son who is lying down (to mitigate the influence of gravity)，MAP (~100 mm Hg) is much higher than the pressure in the capillaries (~20 mm Hg) and in the veins(~5 mm Hg). Although it is the MAP that is useful in considering the force that drives blood across the capillaries and into the veins， pressure in the arteries fluc-tuates during the cardiac cycle. Pressure rises during systole， when blood is being ejected from the heart. The peak arterial pressure during this phase of**\n\n【32】the cycle is called systolic pressure. Pressure then falls to reach a minimum diastolic pressure as blood flows across the vascular beds during the phase of the cardiac cycle when no blood is being ejected from the heart. The arterial pressures that are estimated during the taking of blood pressure by ausculta-tion are the systolic and diastolic pressures. The MAP can be estimated from these pressures by using the equation\n\n【33】**where MAP is mean arterial pressure， DP is diastolic pressure， and SP is sys-tolic pressure.**\n\n【34】**The difference between systolic pressure and diastolic pressure is also known as the pulse pressure. Pulse pressure provides some information about stroke volume and vascular capacitance. Stroke volume can vary from moment to moment and depends on cardiac output and heart rate. Vascular capacitance， in contrast， changes over a longer time， and that change appears to be a con-sequence of aging. With the decrease in capacitance with aging， systolic pres-sure tends to increase and diastolic pressure tends to decrease.**\n\n【35】**There is a relationship among flow， pressure， and resistance that can be expressed mathematically as**\n\n【36】where Q is flow， AP is MAP minus venous pressure (VP)， and R is resistance to flow across the bed.\n\n【37】**Unless regulatory mechanisms are impaired， mean pressure in the large conducting arteries normally is held within fairly narrow limits. Thus， blood flow to any particular vascular bed normally is regulated by changes in resist-ance to flow provided mainly by the arterioles. However， in pathologic states such as the one described in this case， large conducting arteries can be obstructed to the point where they offer significant resistance as a result of decreased radius and turbulent flow.

{"seq_id": "acb1ffdb-0001-47a2-946a-a779bf3c9b6b", "title": null, "text": "【0】CASE 27\n-------\n\n【1】A 63-year-old woman is afflicted with widespread metastatic ovarian cancer that has recurred despite surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. She has extensive pelvic and peritoneal tumor burden. The tumors are affecting her stomach and small bowel and encase her sigmoid colon. As a result, she has frequent bouts of small- and large-bowel obstruction and near-obstruction. These episodes are painful and cause severe nausea and vomiting. Her condition thus far has been managed by decompressing the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract using a nasogastric tube, but the bouts are becoming more frequent, more painful, and more distressing to the patient. Furthermore, hepatic metastases are causing early liver failure. There are no surgical solutions for her obstructions, because her upper and lower GI tracts are severely affected. It is predicted that within 3 to 6 months, but most likely within 3 to 6 weeks, she will die of complications related to her tumor no matter what interventions are attempted. At this time, the patient is recovering from the latest and most severe episode of obstruction. She is just starting to take liquids by mouth, and she may be able to remove the nasogastric tube in the next few days. Everyone involved agrees that the patient seems mentally sharp, and no one questions whether she has the capacity to make medical decisions for herself. In discussions with her oncologist, the patient points out that the end of her life is almost certain to be characterized by severe pain and suffering, and, in her view, a lack of dignity. She asks the physician to prescribe a medication such as a barbiturate that will end her life painlessly at a time of her choosing.\n\n【2】 If the physician were to prescribe a medication for the patient to administer herself, the intent of which is to end her life, what should the act of prescribing most properly be called?\n\n【3】 Would such an act be ethical?\n\n【4】 Would it be legal?\n\n【5】 What are the alternatives in this situation?\n\n【6】### ANSWERS TO CASE 27:\n\n【7】#### Physician-Assisted Suicide\n\n【8】_Summary_ : A woman is facing the prospect of a death preceded by pain and indignity. She has requested a lethal prescription that she plans to administer to herself at a time of her choosing. The physician must evaluate the ethics and the legality of providing her with a lethal prescription.\n\n【9】 The act of prescribing a lethal medication for the patient to administer herself with intent of death : This is called physician-assisted suicide (PAS) or physician aid in dying (PAD).\n\n【10】 Would such an act be ethical? The ethics of PAS are controversial and unsettled. However, public and professional attitudes toward PAS appear to be shifting in favor of its permissibility as experience grows in the states that have legalized the action.\n\n【11】 Would it be legal? As of publication, legislatures have passed laws in 3 states that authorize PAS and describe preconditions and procedures for its implementation. These are Oregon, Washington, and Vermont. In Montana and New Mexico, courts have ruled in particular cases that state laws do not prohibit PAS.\n\n【12】 Alternatives in this situation : Alternatives to PAS include continued psychological support and adequate palliation of physical and emotional suffering, voluntary stopping eating and drinking (VSED), and palliative sedation.\n\n【13】### ANALYSIS\n\n【14】##### _Objectives_\n\n【15】1\\. Define PAS.\n\n【16】2\\. Distinguish PAS from palliation of suffering at the end of life and from euthanasia.\n\n【17】3\\. Understand the ethical arguments for and against the permissibility of PAS.\n\n【18】4\\. Understand the legal status of PAS in the United States.\n\n【19】##### _Considerations_\n\n【20】When a dying patient requests a lethal prescription that he or she plans to administer to himself or herself, physicians must recognize this as an example of a request for PAS. Physicians must evaluate the competence of the patient and explore the reasons for the request. Whether PAS is legal or illegal in the physician’s state, physicians should carefully investigate alternatives to PAS. Physicians must be able to distinguish PAS, which is legal only in some jurisdictions, from the palliation of symptoms, which is legal, and in fact required, in all jurisdictions, and from euthanasia, which is illegal in all US jurisdictions.\n\n【21】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【22】#### Physician-Assisted Suicide\n\n【23】### DEFINITIONS\n\n【24】EUTHANASIA : When a physician administers a fatal medication or performs a fatal procedure for the purpose of causing a patient’s death earlier than the death would have otherwise occurred.\n\n【25】PALLIATIVE SEDATION : Formerly called “terminal sedation,” it occurs when physicians sedate a patient into unconsciousness for the purpose of alleviating suffering (whether physical or emotional) at the end of life. While this can result in death occurring sooner than it would otherwise have happened, the earlier death is not intended, nor is it required to achieve the palliative effect. Thus, palliative sedation is not the equivalent to euthanasia.\n\n【26】PHYSICIAN AID IN DYING OR PHYSICIAN-ASSISTED SUICIDE : These interchangeable terms refer to physicians who provide the medical means for a patient to cause his or her own death earlier than the death would otherwise have occurred.\n\n【27】VOLUNTARY STOPPING OF EATING AND DRINKING : Occurs when a competent patient voluntarily chooses to stop taking in enough hydration and nutrition to sustain life.\n\n【28】### CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【29】When clinicians receive a request for aid in dying, they must evaluate the request to fully understand what is being requested. Is the patient asking for PAS, euthanasia, or something else? The clinician must also be aware of the legally permissible options where he or she practices. With these facts in mind, one can evaluate whether the request can be honored both ethically and legally. Whatever the result of these deliberations, physicians must always attempt to understand the reasons for a request for aid in dying, and they must try to identify alternative strategies for addressing the patient’s concerns without hastening death. In jurisdictions in which PAS is legal, there are some important procedural safeguards that must be observed, which are described further in the discussion below. Clinicians contemplating PAS should consult other colleagues as a way to ensure clarity of thinking and justifiability of their actions. In the section that follows, these issues are considered in more detail.\n\n【30】### ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION:\n\n【31】##### _If the physician were to prescribe a medication for the patient to administer himself or herself, the intent of which is to end life, what should the act of prescribing most properly be called?_\n\n【32】This would usually be described as PAS. This is sometimes called PAD to avoid any unwarranted connotations of the word “suicide.”\n\n【33】When a physician provides access to a medical technique or medication that the patient will administer to himself or herself, the physician is not directly (or most proximately) causing the death; thus, this would not be considered an act of killing. One might describe such a prescription as “allowing to die,” but this description is usually used when withdrawing or withholding a life-sustaining measure such as mechanical ventilation or tube feedings. Some would not consider “allowing to die” a plausible use of the phrase when physicians aid patients in causing their own death. Euthanasia occurs when a physician acts as the proximate cause of death, for example, by injecting a lethal medication intravenously or into a feeding tube.\n\n【34】##### _Would such an act be ethical?_\n\n【35】The ethics of PAS are controversial and unsettled. Much has been written on both sides of the issue. Arguments defending the permissibility of PAS rely on widely accepted principles in biomedical ethics. The following types of argument can be made:\n\n【36】1\\. Respect for autonomy : Since we all must die, we should allow each other some control over the timing and manner of death.\n\n【37】2\\. Beneficence or compassion : Suffering comes in many forms, both physical and emotional or psychological. Pain can often, but not always, be treated without intentionally causing death earlier than it would otherwise occur. The existential pain some experience with the loss of independence, loss of sense of self, and loss of function, can be as intense as physical pain. These types of suffering might not always be “treatable” without hastening death; thus, PAS may be viewed by some as a compassionate response to suffering.\n\n【38】3\\. The diminishing duty to prolong life : For a terminally ill patient, who, by definition, will die soon in any case, the duty to prolong life diminishes as death approaches. For some, the duty to alleviate suffering and respect autonomy will outweigh the duty to prolong life at a point before death would occur in the absence of PAS.\n\n【39】4\\. Honesty and professional integrity : There is evidence that PAS already occurs, even in jurisdictions where it is illegal. Physicians who violate the law by participating in PAS have an incentive to do so in secret and cannot discuss their activities without fear of legal repercussions. Legally permitting PAS would allow the practice to be done openly, with scrutiny by the public and by legal and professional bodies, so that it can be regulated properly to minimize mistakes or abuses.\n\n【40】5\\. The mere availability of PAS might help patients even if they do not go on to take the lethal medication. Patients who fear loss of control or unbearable suffering at the end of their lives are often comforted by the knowledge that PAS is available. Many who receive lethal prescriptions continue to live as long as possible, dying without ever using the lethal prescription.\n\n【41】The following types of arguments are often made that PAS is morally impermissible:\n\n【42】1\\. Professional integrity : Some believe that because historical ethical traditions in medicine, such as the Hippocratic oath, have forbidden the intentional administration of fatal medications, it should not be permitted. Some major professional bodies, including the American Medical Association, oppose PAS, due to the public perception of an erosion of the professional integrity of physicians.\n\n【43】2\\. Potential for abuse : Some worry that vulnerable individuals, including the elderly or those who lack access to ordinary care, will be pressured into pursuing assisted death.\n\n【44】3\\. Sanctity of life : This type of argument is usually rooted in religious traditions that claim that intentionally causing death is a violation of the “sanctity” of life.\n\n【45】4\\. Fallibility of medical professionals : Some are concerned with the possibility of error, because it is well known that both diagnoses and prognoses are sometimes given in error. Furthermore, physicians cannot always detect the factors that should indicate that a patient is not able to provide voluntary competent informed consent to PAS. For example, coercion by family members or severe depression might not always be easy to detect.\n\n【46】There is a deep literature on the defensibility of PAS and the issue is far from settled. However, PAS is increasingly perceived as permissible by both the public and by medical professionals. This is reflected in the gradual adoption of laws permitting PAS in various states.\n\n【47】##### _Would it be legal?_\n\n【48】In the United States, PAS has been legal in Oregon since 1997, in Washington since 2009, and in Vermont since 2013. The laws in these states are similar, and they have a number of preconditions and procedural requirements meant to ensure that PAS is performed properly, and only in appropriate patients. In Montana, a 2009 court ruling found that there is no public policy or law that would prohibit PAS, so PAS is considered legal but there is no statute describing the proper procedure. In New Mexico in January 2014, a state trial court ruled that PAS was permissible; however, at the time of this writing, the ruling was subject to reversal on appeal.\n\n【49】In the three states that have passed laws explicitly permitting PAS, the following conditions are set. Patients must be state residents older than 18 years of age and must be competent to make medical decisions. They must have a terminal illness (an incurable condition expected to be fatal within 6 months as determined by two physicians). They must be able to voluntarily express a wish to die. The decision must be informed—that is, the patient must be fully informed about the medical diagnosis, the prognosis, the potential risks of the prescription for PAS (usually a barbiturate), the probable result of taking the medication (death), and alternatives including palliative care, hospice care, and counseling. The patient’s reasons for the request must be evaluated carefully, and alternatives to PAS that might help the patient achieve their goals must be discussed. A consulting physician must review the medical facts, confirm the diagnosis, and confirm that the patient is competent and is voluntarily requesting a lethal prescription. If either the original or the consulting physician has concerns about psychiatric factors that might impair the patient’s judgment, then the physicians must refer to a counselor.\n\n【50】##### _What are the alternatives in this situation?_\n\n【51】Even in states in which PAS is legal, physicians must be familiar with the alternatives to a lethal prescription. It is likely that many patients contemplating PAS do so because they are afraid of conditions that have not yet materialized, but can be predicted to do so. If those conditions can be ameliorated without a lethal prescription, then, generally speaking, it is preferable to do so. Examples include treating pain or physical suffering with appropriate medications and palliative techniques; treating fear of abandonment with more engagement and perhaps counseling or support groups; treating the fear of loss of control with engagement or perhaps with hospice care; and reassuring the patient that he or she will not be alone at the end.\n\n【52】Many patients can hasten their own death without taking a medication to do so and instead act by VSED. By most accounts, this is a painless method that gradually results in unconsciousness and death over a period of days or up to a couple of weeks. Because this does not require a physician’s direct aid, physicians cannot be accused of participating in PAS even if they remain engaged in the care of a patient dying after VSED. Indeed, physicians have an obligation to remain engaged to palliate any symptoms that occur.\n\n【53】Another option is palliative sedation. This is a procedure whereby suffering patients are sedated into unconsciousness to palliate their suffering. Because they are unconscious, they are not eating or drinking, and will necessarily die sooner than they otherwise would have. Palliative sedation is a preferred term for this practice, which is sometimes called terminal sedation. However, the word _terminal_ implies that the purpose of the sedation is to cause death, whereas the procedure should only be performed as a way to palliate suffering that cannot be alleviated any other way. The fact that death will occur sooner as a result of the sedation is an unintended (though foreseeable) consequence. In other words, if the procedure did not hasten death, it would still be performed because it would still have the primary benefit of alleviating suffering.\n\n【54】###", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

There is no pneumothorax  删除换行 or evidence of free air under the diaphragm.\n\n【11】Normal aortic anatomy: The aorta is divided into the ascending thoracic aorta, arch of  删除换行 the aorta, descending thoracic aorta and abdominal aorta. The ascending aorta begins at  删除换行 the aortic root running superiorly and anteriorly, adjacent to the right side of the ster删除8：<u>￾</u>num. It is enclosed with the pulmonary trunk in a sheath of serous pericardium and is in  删除换行 continuation with the arch of the aorta.

The  删除换行 arch gives rise to the brachiocephalic artery, left carotid artery and left subclavian artery  删除换行 as it runs across the mediastinum to become the descending thoracic aorta.

Its incidence increases in congenital heart disease (e.g. tetral删除8：<u>￾</u>ogy of Fallot), and is commonly associated with one of three aberrant vascular anomalies:\n\n【13】• Right aortic arch with aberrant left subclavian artery: This is the commonest right  删除换行 aortic arch anomaly and is associated with cardiac septal defects and coarctation. The  删除换行 patient is usually asymptomatic but its positioning predisposes to aortic torsion in  删除换行 adulthood. The left carotid artery is the first branch of the aortic arch with an aberrant  删除换行 left subclavian artery arising from the proximal descending aorta.\n\n【14】• Right aortic arch with mirror image branching: As the second commonest right aortic  删除换行 arch anomaly, this is caused by embryological interruption of the arch between the left  删除换行 subclavian artery and the descending aorta, most commonly just distal to the ductus arter删除8：<u>￾</u>iosus.

He has been treated with albuterol via nebulizer and/or metered‐dose inhaler every 4 hours since the onset of symptoms yesterday with no improvement. His last albuterol treatment was given 3 hours ago. He had problems with cough and wheezing in school, so was taken to the primary care provider to be seen urgently. There is no history of fever, no recent changes in the weather, nor does the patient have cold symptoms. He has not had any recent environmental exposures such as cigarette smoke. There are no known food or drug allergies, but he does have seasonal environmental allergies and today he was playing outside when his symptoms began. His appetite is also decreased.Past Medical History\n--------------------\n\n【5】This boy was born at term and went home with his mother. He is up to date on his routine immunizations, but did not have his annual influenza vaccine this year. His weight is less than the first percentile for his age and gender and his current body mass index (BMI) is 11.5, which is also less than the first percentile for age and gender. At age 6 years, the patient was diagnosed with asthma after experiencing recurrent episodes of wheezing, treated in outpatient care. He has no history of hospitalizations for asthma, although he has been to the emergency department (ED) on multiple occasions for asthma exacerbations. His past medical history is significant for seasonal allergies, eczema, failure to thrive, and autism.Past Surgical History\n---------------------\n\n【6】This child has not had any surgical procedures.Family History\n--------------\n\n【7】The patient’s mother and maternal grandfather both have asthma. His mother also has a history of seasonal allergies. No other family history of asthma, allergies, eczema, or lung disease.Current Status\n--------------\n\n【8】On arrival at the primary care office, the patient is wheezing throughout all lung fields and has decreased breath sounds with poor air exchange. He is hypoxic, with an oxygen saturation of 88–90% on room air. His initial respiratory rate is 34 breaths per minute with severe intercostal, suprasternal, and supraclavicular retractions. He is sitting up on the examination table with forward posturing.Questions\n---------\n\n【9】Answer the following questions using the details provided.\n\n【10】1.  Based on the data given, what are the differential diagnoses and the most likely diagnosis for this child?\n2.  What is the best way to increase this patient’s oxygenation?\n3.  What medications are recommended to be given in the outpatient areas?\n4.  What are the next steps in managing this case? How would you provide a formal sign‐out to the ED using the SBAR format?Rationale and Evidence‐based Practice Explanation\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】### Based on the data given, what are the differential diagnoses and the most likely diagnosis for this child?\n\n【12】Differential diagnoses for this child include severe asthma exacerbation associated with viral illness, exposure to allergens, exercise, or other inciting factors. Other potential diagnoses would include foreign body aspiration and pneumonia. It would be unlikely that the boy had a viral illness or pneumonia, as he has not had any other symptoms except for wheezing and cough and these symptoms were only present for 2 days.\n\n【13】A severe asthma exacerbation is the most likely cause of the child’s symptoms, related to the history and findings of difficulty breathing, wheezing, cough, and hypoxia. This child has also reported inciting factors of exercise and environmental allergy exposure that may have triggered the exacerbation 删除10：<u>(Link, 2014 )</u>.\n\n【14】Moderate to severe asthma exacerbations are typically triggered acute episodes of respiratory distress, cough, and wheezing in a patient with a history of asthma. This patient requires prompt treatment with beta‐agonists, systemic corticosteroids, and oxygen. Close monitoring for clinical deterioration and ongoing clinical assessments are important. In the primary care office, initial therapies can be provided, especially if there will be a wait for emergency medical service (EMS) to arrive. However, without monitoring equipment, it is important to observe and assess the patient frequently until appropriate monitoring is available.\n\n【15】### What is the best way to increase this patient’s oxygenation?\n\n【16】Oxygen therapy is recommended for children with asthma who cannot maintain oxygenation above 92% on room air. For patients who are spontaneously breathing, oxygenation often begins with delivery via a facemask or nasal cannula. If the patient fails to respond to interventions and requires additional oxygen support, non‐invasive positive pressure ventilation may be beneficial. This may provide relief for fatigued muscles while also preventing airway collapse and supporting oxygenation.\n\n【17】### What medications are recommended to be given in the outpatient areas?\n\n【18】The pathogenesis of asthma involves underlying inflammation, which is variable and based on the individual patient and the severity of disease. In an acute exacerbation, bronchoconstriction occurs with exposure to a trigger or illness resulting in airway obstruction. Inhaled short‐acting beta‐agonists (SABAs) such as albuterol and levalbuterol combined with ipratropium bromide are first‐line therapy for an acute outpatient asthma exacerbation. SABAs have a rapid onset of action (within 15 minutes), and because they are bronchodilators, airflow is improved by relieving smooth muscle constriction and relaxing the airway. Ipratropium bromide (Atrovent) also provides bronchodilation through smooth muscle relaxation in combination with albuterol 删除10：<u>(Link, 2014 )</u>. These therapies should be administered up to three times back‐to‐back or at 20–30 minute intervals. Continuous albuterol therapy may be needed if there is no significant improvement in the patient’s respiratory status. Because of the risk for side effects from SABAs (hypertension, tachycardia, or tremors), patients must be continuously monitored in an acute care setting.\n\n【19】Systemic corticosteroids decrease airway inflammation in patients who experience acute asthma exacerbation. Their onset of action is within 2–6 hours after administration. It is best to administer systemic corticosteroids as soon as possible after arrival in the office or ED. Early administration has been shown to reduce hospital admission rates for asthma exacerbations. Prednisone or prednisolone are typically first‐line steroid treatments, but there is limited documentation of the benefits of using dexamethasone due to its longer‐lasting effect.\n\n【20】### What are the next steps in managing this case? How would you provide a formal sign‐out to the ED using the SBAR format?\n\n【21】This patient continues to be in respiratory distress and he will therefore require immediate transport to the nearest ED for continued support and additional intervention. The local EMS should be notified to respond to the pediatric office, as opposed to asking family to drive him to the ED. It is then important for the provider to notify the ED and provide a sign‐out regarding the patient. SBAR (situation, background, assessment, recommendation) is a standardized method of providing comprehensive information using a mnemonic to assist in remembering important information to provide between healthcare providers in patient handoffs. Failed communication has been identified as a primary reason for sentinel and adverse events as patients are cared for across healthcare settings. The Joint Commission and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, among other organizations, recommend using a standardized approach when communicating patient information. Using the SBAR approach, the handoff would result in a phone call to the ED in order to speak with a pediatric provider. See Table 83.1 for an example of this call in SBAR format.\n\n【22】Table 83.1 Example of SBAR handoff.\n\n|  | Explanation of section | Handoff information to relay |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| S | Current status and situation of the patient | This is the primary care office on ABC street. We are sending a child who is experiencing status asthmaticus by EMS to the ED. He needs continued oxygen and potentially hospital admission. This is a 7‐year‐old male who presented to our office today in status asthmaticus with oxygen saturation of 88% on room air, requiring oxygen and continuing to wheeze despite receiving albuterol nebs and dexamethasone. Vital signs are temperature 99, HR 136, RR 38, BP 92/46, oxygen saturation is 94% on 15 L/min oxygen. Weight 19 kg, height 114 cm |\n| B | Background information to include the history of the present illness, allergies, current medications | This boy was diagnosed with mild, intermittent asthma a year ago and has had two ED visits since then, but is currently only taking albuterol nebs PRN for wheezing. He began with a cough and wheezing 2 days ago without any associated illness or fever. Wheezing worsened in school today and his mother brought him to us this afternoon. His other history includes a diagnosis of failure to thrive and seasonal allergies. He has no known food or drug allergies and albuterol is his only current medication |\n| A | Assessment of the patient, with potential diagnoses | I think this child is in status asthmaticus and needs more aggressive treatment |\n| R | Recommendation for care | I do not think this child needs any diagnostic testing, unless he needs to be NPO for a long period of time, develops fever or becomes more tachypneic, indicating the possibility of pneumonia |\n\n【24】Continuation of case : The boy is treated with oxygen via facemask, and administered oral dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg and a nebulized treatment of ipratropium bromide 250 μg and albuterol 2.5 mg per 3 mL. Oxygen is administered at 10 L/min initially, but requires an increase to 15 L/min to maintain his oxygen saturations above 96%. Because of the level of hypoxia, respiratory distress, and oxygen requirement of this patient, staff calls 911 for EMS transport to the nearest ED. Two additional doses of albuterol are administered at continuous intervals while awaiting the arrival of EMS.Additional Questions and Evidence‐based Rationale\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【25】1.  What other therapies would be initiated in the ED?\n2.  Should diagnostic studies be obtained for this patient in the ED?\n\n【26】### What other therapies would be initiated in the ED?\n\n【27】Continuous albuterol therapy should be considered if the patient has limited response to the initial three back‐to‐back treatments. Intravenous magnesium sulfate (25–75 mg/kg, maximum 2.5 g administered over 20 minutes) has been shown to be beneficial in children with severe asthma exacerbation and is considered for those who have failed traditional first‐line therapies of albuterol and glucocorticoids. It is part of asthma pathways in the ED. It is thought that magnesium relaxes smooth muscle by enhancing calcium uptake in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and/or as a calcium antagonist, but the exact mechanism of action is not known. Another benefit of magnesium sulfate in asthma is that it reduces release of histamine from mast cells and may act as an anticholinergic agent. Advanced oxygenation therapy such as non‐invasive positive pressure ventilation may be used if the patient has poor response to other interventions and remains hypoxic. Subcutaneous or intramuscular epinephrine or terbutaline (systemic beta‐agonists) may be better than inhaled therapies in children who have poor inspiratory flow, are anxious or uncooperative, or who have poor response to initial inhaled therapies. It is also important to assess hydration and, if needed, administer intravenous fluid boluses and maintenance fluid. Children with asthma can become dehydrated quickly due to poor oral intake, insensible fluid losses, and increased metabolic demand.\n\n【28】### Should diagnostic studies be obtained for this patient in the ED?\n\n【29】Arterial blood gases are not as useful in the child who is breathing spontaneously without severe distress and are painful to obtain, which could worsen respiratory distress. With rapid deterioration, a blood gas can assist in making a decision for intubation and ventilation. Chest radiographs only need to be considered with focal findings of crackles or decreased breath sounds, along with fever and/or severe disease. Chest radiographs can help to rule out pneumonia, atelectasis, air leak, and foreign body in certain severe cases that do not respond to conventional therapies. Overall, there is evidence supporting the view that radiographs and laboratory studies are not indicated if the diagnosis is isolated as an asthma exacerbation without other confounding factors.\n\n【30】As the primary care provider for this child, it is important to stay in contact with the ED and inpatient unit if the child is admitted. With this type of exacerbation and/or hospitalization, prevention of future acute illness is the goal. Since this boy was not previously taking daily medications, the National Institutes of Health Asthma Guidelines recommend starting a daily medication such as an inhaled steroid. The patient should also return to his primary care provider within 1–3 days following discharge. Monitoring in the office on a regular basis is also recommended to monitor symptoms and need for escalation in maintenance therapies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

A urine pregnancy test is negative. She was on antipsychotic medication for a history of schizophrenia, but has not taken the medication in 6 months. Laboratory studies reveal normal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), T3, and T4 and the thyroid is not palpable. The physician makes an assessment that the circumstances and characteristics are likely associated with a pathologic process. Which of the following characteristics is most concerning?\n\n【1】A. Yellow\n\n【2】B. Bilateral\n\n【3】C. Bloody\n\n【4】D. Present with nipple stimulation\n\n【5】**Answer**: 49.1 C . Nipple discharges that are spontaneous, unilateral, persistent, bloody, and associated with a mass are more likely to represent pathologic processes. Most of these are still benign (eg, papilloma, duct ectasia), but evaluation and surgical intervention are usually required.\n\n【6】**Question**: 49.2 A 52-year-old woman has a palpable breast lump. An attempt at FNA does not result in aspiration of fluid. A mammogram is read as normal. Her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 45. She does not smoke but socially drinks alcohol. She currently uses low-dose estrogen contraception pills and takes 1200 mg of calcium daily. She began her menstrual periods at age 10 and she had her first child at age 24. Which of the following is the appropriate next step?\n\n【7】A. Repeat clinical examination in 4 to 6 weeks.\n\n【8】B. Repeat mammogram routinely in 1 year.\n\n【9】C. Referral for biopsy.\n\n【10】D. Discontinuation of her hormone replacement therapy.\n\n【11】**Answer**: 49.2 C . A biopsy is the next appropriate step in this setting. A negative mammogram is not diagnostic of a benign process and does not rule out the possibility of having a breast cancer. A tissue diagnosis is needed in this setting especially with a known first-degree relative with breast cancer and early age of menarche.\n\n【12】**Question**: 49.3 A 29-year-old woman comes into the clinic with complaints of left-sided nipple discharge. On further questioning she states that the discharge is milky in color. She is a G2P2 with the last birth 3½ years ago. She breast-fed both children for 9 months. She is on no medications and is having regular menstrual periods. You express a small amount of nonbloody milky discharge from several ducts from the left nipple and are unable to express discharge from the right. Which of the following is the best diagnostic step?\n\n【13】A. Send for diagnostic mammogram. If negative, reassure that the discharge is not significant.\n\n【14】B. Refer to a breast specialist for evaluation for unilateral nipple discharge.\n\n【15】C. Obtain TSH, free T4, and prolactin levels.\n\n【16】D. Obtain levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH).\n**Answer**: 49.3 C . The evaluation and management of most cases of galactorrhea can be handled by the primary care physician. If pituitary adenoma is diagnosed then the patient can be referred for specialty care. Milky discharge, galactor-rhea, from multiple ducts in the nonlactating breast may occur in certain syndromes—it is usually due to an increased secretion of pituitary prolactin. A pregnancy test should be the first evaluation. Hypothyroidism can also cause hyperprolactinemia. Psychiatric agents such as chlorpromazine- and estrogen-containing agents such as the oral contraceptive pills may also cause milky discharge.\n\n【17】CLINICAL PEARL\n\n【18】 Approximately 1% of breast cancer occurs in men. A new palpable mass in a man’s breast should prompt a diagnostic evaluation.\n\n【19】 Remember that the question in the mind of just about every woman presenting with a breast-related complaint is, “Do I have breast cancer?” The job of the physician is to both manage the presenting complaint and to answer this question.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The loss of function of what body part will cause her to become symptomatic?\n删除个例：<u>> Reproduced, with permission, from USMLERx.com.</u>\n\n【1】> (A) Bone marrow\n\n【2】> (B) Kidney\n\n【3】> (C) Lining of the small intestine\n\n【4】> (D) RBCs\n\n【5】> (E) Spleen\n\n【6】 **Answer**: The correct answer is A. This blood smear shows abundant lymphoblasts typical of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). Lymphoblasts can be distinguished from normal mature lymphocytes by their fine, homogenous chromatin, irregular nuclear borders, and scant cytoplasm. ALL is a neoplasm that originates from a single B- or T-lymphocyte progenitor cell. Blast cells proliferate and accumulate in the marrow, crowding out other blood cell lines and resulting in suppression of hematopoiesis. Eventually, patients develop symptomatic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia.  \n\n【7】Answer B is incorrect. If this child suffered from chronic kidney disease, she may become anemic due to decreased erythropoietin secretion from the kidneys. Her blood smear would not correlate with that in the image.  \n\n【8】Answer C is incorrect. One important function of the small intestine is to absorb nutrients. If the image showed hypochromic, microcytic RBCs without WBC abnormalities, it would be suggestive of iron-deficiency anemia. Conversely, a macrocytic anemia would suggest folate or vitamin B12 deficiency. These findings could be due to intestinal dysfunction.  \n\n【9】Answer D is incorrect. If this blood smear showed RBCs infected with parasites, we could diagnose malaria. Diagnosis is made using both thin and thick blood smears because the former reveals the species of _Plasmodium_ , and the latter quantifies the percentage of RBCs that are infected (parasite density). One important function of the RBC is to carry hemoglobin-bound oxygen to tissues. The loss of functioning RBCs can lead to symptomatic anemia in patients with malaria.  \n\n【10】Answer E is incorrect. Loss of function of the spleen would show Howell-Jolly bodies (clusters of DNA) in RBCs on a blood smear. A functioning spleen usually removes these protein aggregates. The spleen’s function is similar to that of lymph nodes, the major difference being that the spleen is the major site of immune responses to blood-borne antigens, whereas lymph nodes respond to antigens in the lymph. The spleen is also important in the defense against encapsulated organisms. An example of loss of splenic function is seen in children with sickle cell disease who are at risk for sepsis, meningitis, and pneumonia from encapsulated bacteria such as pneumococcus and _Haemophilus influenzae_ .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Transvaginal ultrasonography reveals no uterine pregnancy.  |\n| --- |\n| What is the most likely diagnosis? Ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancy occurs at a rate of 17：1000 pregnancies. The majority (98%) of casesoccur in the fallopian tubes， most often (90%) in the ampulla.  |\n| What signs and symptoms are commonly associated with this condition? ·Nonruptured ectopic pregnancy： · Abnormal bleeding. ·Abdominal/pelvic pain. ·Nausea/vomiting. ●Pelvic mass.

Shoulder pain (blood in the abdominal cavity irritates the diaphragm and causes referred pain in thedistribution of the phrenic nerve). ·Tachycardia.  |\n| What risk factors are associated with this condition? Risk factors include conditions causing structural or functional damage to the fallopian tubes： · Diethylstilbestrol exposure in utero. In vitro fertilization. Pelvic inflammatory disease. ●Pelvic surgery. Previous ectopic pregnancy. ●TTubal ligation. ·Tuboplasty.  |\n| What are the typical laboratory findings in this condition?The B-hCG level in an ectopic pregnancy is typically<6500 IU/L， which is markedly lower than in a uterinepregnancy. The serumprogesterone level (typically <15 ng/mL) is also much lower than in a uterinepregnancy. In a normal intrauterine pregnancy， the B-hCG level increases by 50% every 48 hours. If thistrend does not occur on serial laboratory results， then an ectopic pregnancy is suspected.  |\n| What are the appropriate treatments for this condition? Treatment may be medical or surgical depending on the clinical situation. The usual medical treatment ismethotrexate， which may be given if the ectopic pregnancy is < 3 cm， the B-hCG level is < 12，000 IU/L， nofetal heart rate is present， and the mother's liver and renal tests are normal. B-hCG levels must be checkedserially after administration of methotrexate to ensure the proper decline in B-hCG， indicating ectopicdemise. Surgery is indicated if the criteria for medical intervention are not met. Surgery may remove partor all of the fallopian tube.

Supportive care and penicillin G\n\n【42】**ANSWERS**\n\n【43】43.11E. Observational studies suggest that immunocompromised patients with NSTI had delays in diagnosis and surgical treatment， because many of the patients failed to exhibit the usual clinical signs and did not have the usual W BC responses associated with NSTIs. Clinicians need to maintain a higher level of vigilance， consider additional imaging studies， and earlier surgical evaluations.\n\n【44】_43.2_ A. CT scan is highly sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of NSTI. The reported sensitivity is 100%， specificity of 85%， positive predictive value of76%， and negative predictive value of 100%； therefore， the CT scan is an excellent tool to rule-out NSTI.\n\n【45】43.3E. Impetigo is a common skin infection with small pustules that develop along with soft tissue inflammation. This process is nearly always caused by b-hemolytic streptococcus infections or Staphylococcus aureus. Treatment is antimicrobial therapy and skin care. The superficial abscess requires drain-age， necrotizing cellulitis requires debridement， deep muscle infection fol-lowing hip prosthesis placement will require surgical drainage and possibly removal of hardware. Necrotizing myositis will require debridement.\n\n【46】43.4B. This patient has findings consistent with N STI associated with injectional drug abuse. Based on the history of black-tar heroin injection， the infection is likely a polymicrobial synergistic infection. Early， aggressive surgical debride-ment and broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy are the keys to reduce mor-tality associated with this process. The role of hyperbaric treatment in this population is unclear.\n\n【47】43.5E. The descriptions given are consistent with a soft tissue abscess with a 3-cm rim of surrounding cellulitis. Incision and drainage of the abscess with antibi-otics treatment are the most appropriate for this patient.\n\n【48】43.6ID. The origin of the infection in this patient is the perirectal area. Abscesses that originate in that location are most likely polymicrobial in nature， and if left untreated， they can progress to develop polymicrobial synergistic NSTI. Hyperbaric treatment for NSTI has not been shown to reduce mortality； in fact， there is a general lack of strong clinical evidence to apply hyperbaric treatments for NSTI， and increase in hospital costs.\n\n【49】43.7IB. This man developed a severe infection of the hand and forearm follow-ing a puncture wound to the hand that he sustained during a fishing trip in the Gulf of Mexico. Because the infectious organisms might be water-borne bacteria， antimicrobial therapy needs to include coverage for Vibrio species(Ceftazidime， tetracycline)， and at the same time penicillin G should be included to cover for Gram positive organisms. Incision and drainage are also very important components of his treatment.\n\n【50】**CLINICALPEARLS**\n\n【51】**)The most common findings in a patient with NSTI are local edema and pain in the presence ofsystemic signs such as high fever (hypothermia in some patients)， tachycardia，and often mental confusion.**\n\n【52】**》NSTI should be suspected when pain and tenderness extend beyond the area ofskin erythema.》When NSTI is strongly suspected， exploration of the wound through a limited incision may help to establish the diagnosis.

On examination， her BP is 100/ 60， HR 80 bpm， and temperature is normal. Her hemoglobin level is 9.5 g/dL， with an elevated Hb A2 level.\n\n【7】**Most likely diagnosis： Anemia due to β-thalassemia minor.**\n\n【8】**Underlying mechanism： Decreased p-globin chain production.**\n\n【9】**Significance of the anemia to pregnancy： Although there is a small risk of intra-uterine growth restriction， the pregnancy is usually uncomplicated. Because there is risk of the baby developing thalassemia major， genetic testing and eval-uation of the father of the baby should be offered.**\n\n【10】**ANALYSIS**\n\n【11】Objectives\n\n【12】1\\. Know that iron deficiency and thalassemia are common causes of microcytic anemia.\n\n【13】2\\. Understand that deficiency of folate and vitamin B.， are causes of macrocytic anemia.\n\n【14】**3\\. Know the diagnostic approach to anemia in pregnancy.**\n\n【15】**Considerations**\n\n【16】This pregnant patient has a mild anemia， since the hemoglobin level is less than10.5 g/dL. The red blood cell (RBC) indices give an indication of the etiology. In this case， the MCV is low， microcytic. The most common cause of microcytic anemia is iron deficiency. Typically， with a mild microcytic anemia in the absence of risk factors for thalassemia (such as Southeast Asian ethnicity)， a trial of iron supplementation and recheck of the hemoglobin in 3 weeks would be the next step. This is called a therapeutic trial of iron. If the hemoglobin level improves， the evidence supports iron deficiency. If the hemoglobin level does not improve， iron studies and a hemoglobin electrophoresis would be the next step. In this case， iron studies were performed which were normal/ high normal， thus eliminating iron deficiency as a cause. The hemoglobin electrophoresis studies strongly sug-gest B-thalassemia trait (heterozygous for β-thalassemia) with the elevated A2hemoglobin. If the patient had p-thalassemia homozygous disease， there would have been complications and clinical manifestations since childhood. The patient should now be counseled about her laboratory findings， and referred for genetic counseling， and instructed that her baby has a one in four risk for p-thalassemia disease if the father of the baby also has B-thalassemia trait. Extra iron should not be given， since these patients can be prone to iron overload.\n\n【17】**APPROACHTO：**\n\n【18】**DEFINITIONS**\n\n【19】**ANEMIA： A hemoglobin level of less than 10.5 g/dL in the pregnant woman.**\n\n【20】IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA： A fall in hemoglobin level that is due to insuf-ficient iron to meet the increased iron requirements in pregnancy.\n\n【21】THALASSEMIA： A decreased production of one or more of the peptide chains(most common are the a and B chains) that make up the globin molecule. This process may result in ineffective erythropoiesis， hemolysis， and varying degrees of anemia.\n\n【22】HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA： An abnormally low hemoglobin level due to red blood cell destruction， which may be divided into congenital causes and acquired causes.\n\n【23】GLUCOSE-6-PHOSPHATE DEHYDROGENASE DEFICIENCY： An X-linked condition whereby the red blood cells may have a decreased capacity for anaerobic glucose metabolism. Certain oxidizing agents， such as nitrofurantoin， can lead to hemolysis.\n\n【24】**CLINICAL APPROACH**\n\n【25】Physiology ofPregnancy\n\n【26】Anemia is a common complication in the pregnant woman. It is most often due to iron deficiency， partially because of decreased iron stores prior to pregnancy and increased demands for iron (due to fetus need and expanded maternal blood vol-ume). A hemoglobin level below 10.5 g/ dL is usually considered a sign of anemia in the pregnant woman， with a mild anemia between 8 and 10 g/ dL and severe as less than 7g/dL.\n\n【27】**Iron Deficiency**\n\n【28】A gravid woman who presents with mild anemia and no risk factors for hemoglo-binopathies (African-American， Southeast Asian， or Mediterranean descent) may be treated with supplemental iron and the hemoglobin level reassessed in 3 to 4weeks. Persistent anemia necessitates an evaluation for iron stores， such as ferritin level (low with iron deficiency) and hemoglobin electrophoresis.\n\n【29】Hemoglobinopathies\n\n【30】The size of the red blood cell may give a clue about the etiology. A microcytic anemia is most commonly due to iron deficiency， although thalassemia may also be causative. Results from a hemoglobin electrophoresis can differentiate between the two， and may also indicate the presence of sickle cell trait or sickle cell anemia. The different types of thalassemias are classified according to the deficient pep-tide chain. In β-thalassemia minor， for example， there is a decreased production of 删除换行 the B-globin chain. This particular thalassemia during pregnancy is usually safe for both the mother and fetus， and there is no specific therapy given other than pro-phylactic folic acid. Patients may be asymptomatic and go their whole life without being aware that they have -thalassemia minor. Genetic counseling in a patient with a known hemoglobinopathy is important because if the baby inherits a reces-sive trait from both parents， it will typically be born with a more serious or fatal disease (ie， B-thalassemia major). A neonate born with B-thalassemia major may appear healthy at birth， but as the hemoglobin F level falls (and no B-chains are able to replace the diminishing y-chains of the fetal hemoglobin)， the infant may become severely anemic and fail to thrive if not adequately transfused. The life expectancy with transfusions is somewhere in the third decade.\n\n【31】Whereas the thalassemias are quantitative defects in a hemoglobin chain pro-duction， sickle cell disease involves a qualitative defect that results in a sickle-shaped and rigid hemoglobin molecule. Sickle cell anemia is a recessive disorder caused by a point mutation in the p-globin chain in which the amino acid glutamic acid is replaced with valine. This causes improper folding of the hemoglobin molecule， which results in either sickle cell disease (HbSS) or sickle cell trait (HbS)， when only the sickle cell trait is inherited. A patient with sickle cell trait should not be discouraged to get pregnant as far as risk to her is concerned； however， her baby has a 1：4 chance of inheriting sickle cell disease if the father also has the sickle cell trait. Infants born with sickle cell disease typically do not show signs of being affected until about 4 months. Patients with sickle cell disease usually deal with symptoms related to anemia (ie， fatigue and shortness of breath) and pain. In preg-nancy， women with sickle cell disease often have a more intense anemia， more fre-quent bouts of sickle cell crisis (painful vaso-occlusive episodes)， and more frequent infections and pulmonary complications. Careful attention must be taken when a pregnant sickle cell patient presents in crisis because some of the symptoms may mimic other common occurrences during pregnancy (ectopic pregnancy， placental abruption， pyelonephritis， appendicitis， or cholecystitis)， and they may be missed. All causes of fever，pain， and low Hg laboratory value should be considered before attributing it to a pain crisis. Also， these patients have a higher incidence of fetal growth retardation and perinatal mortality； therefore， serial ultrasonography is recommended.\n\n【32】Macrocytic Anemia\n\n【33】Macrocytic anemias may be due to vitamin B， and folate deficiency. Because vita-min B， stores last for many years， megaloblastic anemias in pregnancy are much more likely to be caused by folate deficiency.\n\n【34】**Other Conditions**\n\n【35】Less commonly， a woman with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) defi-ciency may develop hemolytic anemia triggered by various medications such as sulfonamides， nitrofurantoin， and antimalarial agents. Nitrofurantoin is a com-mon medication utilized for uncomplicated urinary tract infections. Affected women usually have dark-colored urine due to bilirubinuria， jaundice， and fatigue 删除换行 due to anemia. G6PD deficiency is more commonly seen in the African-American population.\n\n【36】In the pregnant woman with anemia， jaundice， and thrombocytopenia， the examiner must also consider other hemolytic processes，such as HELLP (hemolysis， elevated liver enzymes， low platelets) syndrome， which is a life-threatening condi-tion best treated by delivery. In evaluating anemia， if other hematologic cell lines are also decreased， such as the white blood cell (W BC) count or platelet count， a bone marrow process， such as leukemia or tuberculosis infection of the marrow， should be considered. Bone marrow biopsy may be indicated in these circumstances.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Methanol is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase to formaldehyde and subsequently to formic acid, the most likely cause of major organ toxicity. Formic acid inhibits cytochrome oxidase activity, resulting in tissue hypoxia and lactic acid production. The metabolic acidosis that occurs in methanol overdose is a result of the combination of formic acid and lactic acid that is produced. The most characteristic symptom in methanol poisoning is visual disturbances with blurred vision and a sense of “being in a snowstorm.” Isopropyl alcohol and ethylene glycol similarly are metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase to toxic metabolites. Unfortunately, the toxic metabolites of all of these solvents can cause permanent neurologic damage, blindness, coma, and death. In these clinical settings ethanol can be used therapeutically. It is given by continuous IV infusion to compete for metabolism by alcohol dehydrogenase. With hemodialysis, this can help to reduce the ongoing production of toxins. Sodium bicarbonate can be given to help correct the metabolic acidosis. Fomepizole, another available, very costly (∼$4000 per patient) inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase is also available.\n\n【11】APPROACH TO:\n\n【12】Pharmacology of Solvent Toxicity\n\n【13】#### OBJECTIVES\n\n【14】1\\.

In the tissues, more carbon dioxide is being produced because of the increased metabolic rate. The additional carbon dioxide enters the RBC and is combined with water by carbonic anhydrase to form H2CO3, which then dissociates into hydrogen and bicarbonate. The hydrogen ions are buffered by deoxyhemoglobin, while the bicarbonate diffuses out of the RBCs in exchange for chloride ions. This is called the chloride shift.  \n\n【7】Answer A is incorrect. Bicarbonate travels in the plasma, not the RBCs. When it gets to the lung, it enters the RBCs, transforms back to water and carbon dioxide, and the latter is exhaled.  \n\n【8】Answer B is incorrect. The primary transport of carbon dioxide in the blood (90%) is via bicarbonate. Carbaminohemoglobin accounts for only about 5%.  \n\n【9】Answer D is incorrect. The lungs do not have an acidic environment; the peripheral tissues have an acidic environment. The oxygenation of hemoglobin in the lungs promotes the dissociation of hydrogen ions from deoxyhemoglobin and the equilibrium is shifted toward the production of carbon dioxide from carbonic acid.  \n\n【10】Answer E is incorrect. While most of the carbon dioxide is converted to bicarbonate, bicarbonate does not bind to hemoglobin; hydrogen ions bind hemoglobin.

The patient describes a pattern of decreased need for sleep， yet with no decrease in energy level， which is highly suggestive of a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. He may have had similar episodes in the past， but such patients generally seek help when they are depressed， as opposed to when they are hypomanic or manic. Increased goal-directed activity and excessive pleasure-seeking activities such as drug use are hallmarks of a manic episode. However， it is often very difficult to distinguish between a primary mood disorder and a substance/medication-induced one (answer B) without an extended period of abstinence accompanied by continuing mood complaints. Adjustment dis-order (answer D) or circadian rhythm disorder (answer E) does not explain this patient's array of symptoms.\n\n【29】11.2 D. Answer D (fatigue，increased appetite， vivid and unpleasant dreams) would be most characteristic of cocaine intoxication； cocaine stimulates adrenergic stimulation. Answer A (miosis， slurred speech， drowsiness) is consistent with opioid intoxication； respiratory depression is also common. Answer B\n\n【30】(nystagmus， hypertension， muscle rigidity) describes the classic findings of phencyclidine intoxication. Answer C (conjunctival injection， increased appe-tite， dry mouth) is indicative of cannabis intoxication. Answer E (mydriasis， gooseflesh， rhinorrhea， muscle aches) is consistent with opioid withdrawal.\n\n【31】_11.3 A. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders， 5th edition_ (DSM-5) does not specifically recognize cannabis-induced mood disorders. Mood disorders would be mu1.ch more common with the other substances listed (answer B， cocaine； answer C， alcohol； answer D， methamphetamine； and answer E， inhaling spray paint).\n\n【32】11.4 A. In answer A， the timing and the likely offending agent are most consis-tent with a substance/medication-induced depressive disorder. In answer B， there is likely a strong genetic component to his depression， and there is no mention of his depression's relationship to any periods of sobriety. Cannabis(answer C) is not clearly likely to induce depression， especially at low doses. Answer D is more consistent with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Answer E is most consistent with bereavement.\n\n【33】11.5 C. Beta-blockers are a first-line treatment for essential tremor. Depression is a known potential side effect of beta-blockers. For answers A (hypothyroidism) and B (hypoandrogenism)，levothyroxine and testosterone can mimic mania. In answer D， there is the possibility that the person is treating the rhinorrhea with pseudoephedrine. High-dose， prolonged pseudoephedrine use can cause psychosis or symptoms that mimic mania. Parkinson disease (answer E) is often treated with dopaminergic medications， which can lead to psychosis.\n\n【34】The symptoms of a substance/medication-induced depressive disorder can occur during the period of time the substance is being used or up to a month after use of the substance has ceased.\n\n【35】In order for the mood symptoms to be accurately assessed， the patient should not be acutely intoxicated or undergoing the withdrawal process.\n\n【36】Individuals with medical conditions often take medications for those conditions， and it may sometimes be difficult to discern which (the medical condition or the medication used to treat it) may be causing the depressive disorder.\n\n【37】The history often provides a basis for judgment， or a medication change may be needed to sort out the diagnosis.\n\n【38】A depressive disorder should be diagnosed when it is judged that the substance/medication in question is not etiologically related to the symptoms of depression.\n\n【39】_DSM-5 Task Force.

The client had recently been away from the house for 3 <sup>1 </sup> / <sub>2 </sub> weeks and noticed a mass in the bird's ear when she returned. She has owned the bird since it was 6-8 weeks old and since then there had been no other birds in the household. There were two dogs, but they had never bothered the bird. The bird lived in a 3 ft x 2 ft nonpainted metal cage that contained two wooden dowel perches and ceramic food and water bowls. The bird was fed a seed mixture purchased from a feed store and vegetables. The bird had no other medical problems until now. He was still behaving normally.﻿\n\n【6】Physical Examination Findings\n\n【7】The 101 g bird appeared normal in all respects except for a 1 cm diameter, round, raised, pink soft tissue mass protruding from his right ear . An attempt to aspirate the mass for cytological examination resulted in the rapid withdrawal of approximately 0.5 mL of blood into the syringe. More blood would have been drawn if the procedure had not been stopped. The bird was anesthetized using isoflurane via face mask for radiographic evaluation of the head to determine the extent of the mass. The radiographs revealed a 5 mm x 10 mm soft tissue mass in the region of the right ear, and there was no evidence of osseous involvement of this mass. The ear canal appeared to be open and free of tissue. Rule-outs for the mass included neoplasia, abscess, or hematoma. While the bird was under anesthesia, an attempt to remove the mass by strangulation using a 3-0 synthetic suture was made.

Diagnostic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage is indicated in the evaluation of an immunocompromised patient with acute respiratory distress with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. This procedure is helpful to try to identify possible opportunistic respiratory infections.\n\n【38】**5.3 A. Pulmonary artery pressures and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure measurements using a pulmonary artery catheter would help determine the patients left ventricular end-diastolic pressure， and if the pulmonary artery wedge pressure is less than 18 mm Hg， the diagnosis of ARDS is more likely. If the pulmonary wedge pressure is elevated above 18 mm Hg， then cardiogenic pulmonary edema is the more likely diagnosis.**\n\n【39】5.4 E. The patient s worsening respiratory distress and clinical deterioration can be attributed to several possible processes， including pneumothorax， pulmonary contusion， and atelectasis. An acute change in the patients respiratory status requires a re-evaluation of the ABCs， which includes diminished bilateral breath sounds bilaterally with less audible breath sounds on the left. A chest x-ray would be very helpful at this point to determine if a pnemothorax is the cause ofthis problem. Intubation and mechanical ventilation is the right choice if the patient is in impending respiratory failure. ABG results are helpful for the revaluation of some patients with respiratory distress； however， the results in this patient would not help direct therapy. Diuretic therapy is not appropri-ate for a patient with respiratory distress and hyperdynamic status and no clear evidence of volume overload.\n\n【40】5.5 B. This patients story and findings are highly suggestive of ALI secondary to forced inspiration against a closed or narrowed airway， resulting in “negative pressure pulmonary edema\"； negative pressure pulmonary edema is an unusual variant of ALI and is often self-limiting with supportive care that includes mechanical ventilation and judicious fluid management.\n\n【41】5.6 B. This man develops fever， tachycardia，and tachypnea 9 days after exploratory laparotomy for GSW to the abdomen with multiple intestinal injuries. With slow return of bowel functions and distension of the abdomen， we should be concerned about the possibility of intra-abdominal sepsis， possibly related to an abscess or an anastamotic breakdown. CT scan plus antibiotics are probably the best option at this time， and exploration plus antibiotics are a second best option.\n\n【42】**CLINICALPEARLS**\n\n【43】**》 Acute lung injury and ARDS are associated with increases in dead-space ventilation as there is significant ventilation and perfusion mismatches occurring in va Srious parts ofthe lungs.**\n\n【44】**The oxygen saturation should never be used as the sole parameter to determine when a patient should be intubated.**\n\n【45】**》The blood gas results should not be used as the sole criteria for intubation.**\n\n【46】**》Positive pressure ventilation can produce a variety of injuries that are known as ⅥLI (ventilator-induced lung injury).**\n\n【47】**》Excess fluid administration is one ofthe leading contributors to respira-tory distress in the surgicalpatient.**\n\n【48】**Failure to terminate fluid resuscitation in patients with hemorrhagic shock and septic shock has been demonstrated to increase the pulmo-nary-related morbidity and mortality in ventilated patients.**\n\n【49】**", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Deoxygenation of HbS leads to distortion of  删除换行 the red blood cell into the classic sickle shape. The sickle cells are much less deformable than  删除换行 normal red cells and can obstruct the microcirculation. This results in tissue hypoxia, which  删除换行 causes further sickling. Patients with a sickle cell crisis should be treated with high-flow oxygen,  删除换行 opioid analgesia and fluid resuscitation.

Note that the loop inside  删除换行 the abdomen is more vulnerable  删除换行 to get strangulated.HERNIA 203\n\n【16】When the inguinal hernia is complete (inguinoscrotal  删除换行 swelling) diagnosis is relatively easier but a few conditions  删除换行 should be kept in mind.\n\n【17】A. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF\n\n【18】INGUINOSCROTAL SWELLINGS : 删除换行 1 Encysted hydrocele of the cord.— When a portion  删除换行 of the funicular process persists and remains patent, but  删除换行 shut off from the tunica vaginalis below and the peritoneal  删除换行 cavity above, it eventually becomes distended with fluid  删除换行 and presents a cystic swelling either in the inguinal or  删除换行 inguinoscrotal region or in the scrotum. Fluctuation test  删除换行 and translucency test will be positive. One can very well  删除换行 ‘get above the swelling’. If the swelling is held at its upper  删除换行 limit and the patient is asked to cough there will be no  删除换行 impulse on coughing. This shows that it has no  删除换行 connection with hernia nor with the peritoneal cavity. If  删除换行 the testis is pulled down the swelling comes down and  删除换行 becomes immobile. This is the tracion test. The testis  删除换行 can be felt apart from the swelling.\n\n【19】2. Varicocele. It is a condition in which the veins of  删除换行 the pampiniform plexus become dilated and tortuous. \n\n【20】Usually the left side is affected, probably because (i) the  删除换行 left spermatic vein is longer than the right, (ii) the left  删除换行 spermatic vein enters the left renal vein at right angle,\n\n【21】(iii) at times the left testicular artery arches over the left  删除换行 renal vein to compress it and (iv) the left colon when  删除换行 loaded may press on the left testicular vein. In the  删除换行 beginning the patient will experience aching or dragging  删除换行 pain particularly after prolonged standing. The swelling  删除换行 appears when the patient stands and disappears when he  删除换行 lies down with the scrotum elevated. The impulse on  删除换行 coughing is more like a thrill. On palpation it feels like a  删除换行 ‘bag of worms’. After occluding the superficial inguinal  删除换行 ring with a thumb if the patient is asked to stand up the  删除换行 varicocele fills from below. It must be remembered that a  删除换行 rapid onset of varicocele on the left side suggests  删除换行 carcinoma of the kidney. Early vascular metastasis is  删除换行 characteristic of this disease. So the renal vein is often  删除换行 involved earlier by permeation, which may block the  删除换行 opening of the left spermatic vein and thus causes a quick  删除换行 formation of varicocele on the left side. On the right side  删除换行 the inferior venacava, into which the right spermatic vein  删除换行 drains, is affected later by permeation and that is why  删除换行 onset of varicocele due to carcinoma of the kidney is rarer  删除换行 on the right side.\n\n【22】3. Lymph Varix or lymphangiectasis.— It is a  删除换行 condition in which the lymphatic vessels of the cord  删除换行 become dilated and tortuous caused by obstruction due  删除换行 to filariasis. Past hisory of periodic attacks of fever with  删除换行 simultaneous development of pain and swelling of the  删除换行 cord are the main symptoms of this condition. The 删除换行 swelling appears on standing and disappears  删除换行 spontaneously on lying down, although slower than in  删除换行 case of varicocele. The impulse on coughing is thrill-like  删除换行 and not the typical expansile impulse found in a case of  删除换行 hernia. On palpation it feels soft, cystic and doughy. \n\n【23】Presence of eosinophilia and living micro-filariae in the  删除换行 blood drawn at night are very much diagnostic.\n\n【24】; funiculitis. Besides gonococcal infection  删除换行 funiculitis may be caused by filariasis particularly in this  删除换行 country. Aching in the groin with variable degree of fever  删除换行 are the presenting symptoms in majority of cases. Initial  删除换行 symptoms may be those of acute prostatitis. The inguinal  删除换行 and inguinoscrotal regions will be inflamed and the skin  删除换行 becomes red, oedematous and shiny. It is sometimes very  删除换行 difficult to differentiate it from a small strangulated  删除换行 hernia. While the former condition is mainly treated by  删除换行 conservative means, immediate operative intervention is  删除换行 the only life saving measure for the latter conditon. So  删除换行 differentiation is imperative. Palpation just above the deep  删除换行 inguinal ring is of great help in differentiating these two  删除换行 conditions. In a strangulated hernia the abdominal  删除换行 contents can be felt as they enter the deep inguinal ring  删除换行 whereas in funiculitis no such structure can be felt.\n\n【25】5. Diffuse lipoma of the cord. This is a very rare  删除换行 condition. The cord feels soft and lobulated. The swelling  删除换行 is irreducible having no impulse on coughing.\n\n【26】6. Inflammatory thickcning of the cord (extending  删除换行 upwards from the testis and epididymis).—- Tuberculosis  删除换行 often gives rise to this condition. Slight ache in the testis  删除换行 with generalised symptoms of tuberculosis often ushers  删除换行 this condition. Indurated and slightly tender nodular  删除换行 thickening of the cord can be felt. Epididymis is obviously  删除换行 tender, enlarged and nodular. Rectal examination may  删除换行 reveal indurated seminal vesicle of the corresponding side  删除换行 and sometimes of the contralateral side. In late cases cold  删除换行 abscess develops in the lower and posterior aspect of the  删除换行 scrotum which may discharge itself resulting in formation  删除换行 of a sinus. About two-thirds of the cases active tuberculosis  删除换行 of the renal tract may be evident.\n\n【27】7. Malignant extension of the testis.— This can be  删除换行 easily diagnosed by presence of malignant growth in the  删除换行 testis. The cord feels hard and nodular. There may be  删除换行 secondary deposits in the pre-and para-aortic and even  删除换行 the left supraclavicular lymph nodes.\n\n【28】8. Torsion of the testis. It is mainly a cause of the  删除换行 swelling of scrotum but an undescended testis may frequently 删除换行 undergo torsion which is a subject matter of this chapter. \n\n【29】This condition mimics a strangulated hernia. It will give  删除换行 rise to a tense and tender swelling without an impulse on  删除换行 coughing. Absence of testis in the scrotum should arouse  删除换行 suspicion of this condition. Slight fever, no constipation  删除换行 and dullness on percussion will go in favour of torsion.204 A TEXTBOOK ON SURGICAL SHORT CASES\n\n【30】Ri'inutile test This condition is quite common  删除换行 in children and is often diagnosed as ectopic testis due to  删除换行 the fact that in majority of cases the testis lies in the  删除换行 superficial inguinal pouch. Strong contraction of the  删除换行 cremaster muscle may pull the testis up from the scrotum  删除换行 into the superficial inguinal pouch. The testis is usually  删除换行 well developed, the scrotum is also normally developed  删除换行 and the testis can be brought down to the bottom of the  删除换行 scrotum.\n\n【31】B. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF GROIN\n\n【32】SWELLINGS :\n\n【33】See page 209.\n\n【34】It is a saccular enlargement of  删除换行 the termination of the long saphenous vein. This swelling  删除换行 usually disappears completely when the patient lies down. \n\n【35】The so called impulse on coughing is present in this  删除换行 condition as well, but it is actually a fluid thrill and not  删除换行 an expansile impulse to the examining fingers. Varicosity  删除换行 of the long saphenous vein is usually associated with.\n\n【36】Percussion on varicosities of the long saphenous vein  删除换行 will transmit an impulse upwards to the saphenous varix  删除换行 felt by the fingers of the other hand — Schwartz’s test. \n\n【37】Sometimes a venous hum can be heard when the  删除换行 stethoscope is applied over the saphenous varix.\n\n【38】A search for a possible  删除换行 focus of infection should be made in the drainage area  删除换行 which extends from the umbilicus down to the toes  删除换行 including the terminal portions of the anal canal, urethra  删除换行 and vagina (i.e. portions developed from the ectoderm). \n\n【39】For causes of enlargement of lymph nodes the students  删除换行 are referred to chapter 9. The gland of Cloquet lying  删除换行 within the femoral canal may be enlarged and simulates  删除换行 exactly an irreducible femoral hernia. If any focus cannot  删除换行 be found out or any cause of enlargement of lymph nodes  删除换行 cannot be detected, the nature of the lump remains a  删除换行 matter of opinion which is best settled urgently in the  删除换行 operation theatre.\n\n【40】-t f*M>as absces This is usually a cold abscess  删除换行 tracking down from Pott’s disease. It is a reducible  删除换行 swelling and gives rise to impulse on coughing. It is a  删除换行 painless swelling and if the pulsation of the femoral artery  删除换行 can be palpated it will be appreciated that the swelling is\n\n【41】Lateral to the artery (cf. femoral hernia which is medial to  删除换行 the femoral artery). Sometimes there is an illiac part of  删除换行 the abscess which is determined by cross-fluctuation. \n\n【42】Examination of the back and corresponding iliac fossa  删除换行 including X-rays clarifies the diagnosis.\n\n【43】This bursa lies in front  删除换行 of the hip joint and under the psoas major muscle. It  删除换行 often communicates with the hip joint. In osteoarthritis  删除换行 of the hip joint this bursa becomes enlarged and produces 删除换行 a tense and cystic swelling below the inguinal ligament. \n\n【44】This swelling diminishes in size when the hip joint is flexed.\n\n【45】Presence of osteoarthritis in the hip joint, a cystic swelling,  删除换行 absence of impulse on coughing and that the swelling 删除换行 diminishes in size during flexion of the hip joint are the  删除换行 diagnostic points in favour of this condition.\n\n【46】6. Undescended and ectopic testis An undescended 删除换行 testis is one which is arrested at any point along its normal  删除换行 path of descent. An ectopic testis is one which has deviated  删除换行 from its usual path of descent. In both these conditions  删除换行 the scrotum of the same side will be empty. If the swelling  删除换行 is within the inguinal canal it is probably an undescended  删除换行 testis. The testis is recognized by its shape, feel and  删除换行 ‘testicular sensation’. Ascertain whether the testis is lying  删除换行 superficial or deep to the abdominal muscles by the ‘rising  删除换行 test’. The commonest site of an ectopic testis, is just above  删除换行 and lateral to the superficial inguinal ring and superficial  删除换行 to the external oblique aponeurosis. It must be  删除换行 remembered that the undescended testis is always smaller  删除换行 and less developed than its fellow in the scrotum but an  删除换行 ectopic testis is usually well developed. Sometimes an  删除换行 undescended testis may be associated with an inguinal  删除换行 or an interstitial hernia.\n\n【47】Though the commonest position of ectopic testis is at  删除换行 the superficial inguinal pouch, yet ectopic testis may be  删除换行 found (i) at the root of the penis (pubic type), (ii) at the  删除换行 perineum (perineal type) and (iii) rarely at the upper  删除换行 and medial part of the femoral triangle (femoral type).\n\n【48】The diagnostic points in favour of this  删除换行 condition are discussed in Chapter 1.\n\n【49】8. Hydrocele of a femoral hernial sac.— This is an  删除换行 extremely rare condition in which the neck of the sac  删除换行 becomes plugged with omentum or by adhesions. The  删除换行 hydrocele of the sac is thus produced by the secretion of  删除换行 the peritoneum.\n\n【50】9.

She has no history of recent travel or sick contacts but has a pet puppy, which the mother says has also had diarrhea for the past week. A stool culture incubated at 42°C in a microaerophilic environment shows many gram-negative, comma-shaped organisms, each with a single polar flagellum. The organism responsible for this patient’s sickness is associated with the possible development of which of the following symptoms?\n\n【1】> (A) Acute renal failure and thrombocytopenia with hemolytic anemia\n\n【2】> (B) Fever, migratory polyarthritis, and carditis\n\n【3】> (C) Fever, new murmur, small erythematous lesions on the palms, and splinter hemorrhages on the nail bed\n\n【4】> (D) Petechial rash and bilateral hemorrhage into the adrenal glands\n\n【5】> (E) Symmetric ascending muscle weakness beginning in the distal lower extremities\n\n【6】 **Answer**: The correct answer is E . Guillain-Barré syndrome is characterized by rapidly progressing ascending paralysis. It is an autoimmune-mediated illness that can occur following a variety of infectious diseases, but is particularly associated with prior infection by _Campylobacter jejuni. C jejuni_ gastroenteritis is characterized in this patient by her vomiting and bloody diarrhea together with the finding of comma-shaped organisms with a single polar flagellum when cultured at 42°C in a microaerophilic environment. Other enteric pathogens with this morphology include bacteria of the _Vibrio_ genus (V _cholera_ and _V parahaemolyticus)_ . These species, however, are not endemic to the United States and would not be expected in a patient without a recent travel history, nor do the symptoms match. _C jejuni_ is transmitted to humans via the fecal-oral route from either domestic animals or eating undercooked poultry.  \n\n【7】Answer A is incorrect . Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) is characterized by acute renal failure and thrombocytopenia with hemolytic anemia. HUS can be a complication of infection caused by _Escherichia coli_ O157:H7, not _Campylobacter jejuni_ . Like _C jejuni, E coli_ O157:H7 is a gram-negative rod that can cause enteritis. _E coli_ , however, is characterized by numerous flagella and aerobic metabolism.  \n\n【8】Answer B is incorrect . Rheumatic fever is characterized by fever, migratory polyarthritis, and carditis. It is known to occur after Group A streptococcal pharyngitis. There is no evidence of _Streptococcus pyogenes_ infection in this patient, as she does not have symptoms of pharyngitis or culture findings of gram-positive cocci in chains.  \n\n【9】Answer C is incorrect . Fever, a new murmur, Janeway lesions, and nail bed hemorrhages are signs of bacterial endocarditis. Acute endocarditis is most often caused by _Staphylococcus aureus_ , and subacute infection are often caused by viridans group streptococci. Endocarditis is not a known sequelae of _C jejuni_ infection.  \n\n【10】Answer D is incorrect . Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome is characterized by high fever, shock, purpura, and adrenal insufficiency. It is classically associated with _Neisseria meningitides_ septicemia. This patient’s symptoms do not resemble meningitis nor does the culture match the gram-negative diplococci of _Neisseria_ .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

She has an established history of coronary artery dis-ease. Women， as well as the elderly and diabetic patients， can present with symptoms of burning or shortness of breath alone as their “angina equivalent，”and thus a high index of suspicion for coronary artery disease should be maintained in these patient populations. The diagnosis can be confirmed with positive laboratory tests for creati-nine kinase myocardial band (CK-MB) and troponin T or I (TnT or TnI). If these tests are negative， the patient is said to be experiencing unstable angina (UA).\n\n【7】Other life-threatening conditions that can cause chest pain include aortic dis-section and pulmonary embolism； the possibility for either ofthese diagnoses should be entertained and excluded if there is any clinical suspicion for their presence. Afterward， the patient should be loaded with aspirin 325 mg as well as an adenosine diphosphate (ADP) inhibitor. The patient should also receive parenteral anticoagu-lation. Nitroglycerin should be administered and titrated until the patient’s chest pain has resolved. If there is no evidence of heart failure or cardiogenic shock on exam， intravenous metoprolol can also be administered to reduce myocardial oxy-gen demand by decreasing heart rate， contractility， and blood pressure. If there are high-risk features present (eg， markedly elevated troponin， recurrent ischemic dis-comfort， dynamic ECG changes， or hemodynamic instability)， a glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitor can be considered. Finally， a decision to pursue an early invasive approach versus an initial conservative approach is needed.**Best subsequent management： After aspirin， ADP inhibitor， anticoagulation， and perhaps a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor， this patient should undergo cardiac cath-eterization within 24 hours on the basis of the high-risk factors .****1\\.

In this clinical scenario， the most likely diagnosis is NSTEMI. If the patient did not have positive cardiac biomarkers， the diagnosis would be unstable angina. After ruling out other potential life-threatening causes of chest pain such as aortic dissection， pneumothorax， or pulmonary embolism， the patient should be administered aspirin，ADP inhibitor， anticoagulation， and perhaps a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor. Risk stratification  suggests that this patient has high-risk features and thus should undergo cardiac catheterization within 24 hours of presentation. Other testing to rule out secondary causes of UA/NSTEMI such as profound anemia， thyrotoxicosis， hypertensive emergency， sepsis， or tachyar-rhythmias should be performed as clinically indicated.**Patients with NSTEMI or UA can have a variable presentation from recent-onset angina to progressively worsening angina within the past 48 hours to resting anginal pain (>20 minutes). Pain from UA/NSTEMI is more severe and of longer dura-tion when compared to stable angina. NSTEMI is differentiated from UA by the presence of positive cardiac biomarkers. In general， patients with UA/NSTEMI are older and have more cardiac risk factors such as hypertension，hyperlipidemia， or dia-betes when compared to patients with ST elevation myocardial in farction (STEMI). They are also more likely to have a prior history of myocardial infarction or to have undergone revascularization with PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).**\n\n【15】Associated symptoms include dyspnea， diaphoresis， palpitations， nausea， or vom-iting. Diabetic patients， females， or the elderly may present without chest pain， describing only a nonspecific discomfort in combination with one ofthe aforemen-tioned associated symptoms such as dyspnea or diaphoresis. The physical exam sel-dom adds to the diagnosis ofUA/NSTEMI. Patients who present with signs ofheart failure on exam (elevated jugular venous pressure， S3 gallop， or rales) are at increased risk for in-hospital morbidity and mortality. Documentation ofthe baseline physical exam is very important to recognize potential complications that may arise during their hospital stay， particularly the presence or absence of cardiac murmurs as a new murmur may indicate a mechanical complication related to myocardial infarction.\n\n【16】An ECG should be performed within 10 minutes of presentation and is help-ful in risk-stratifying patients. Patients with ST segment depression of ≥0.5 mm or transient ST segment elevation as well as those with a preexisting left bundle branch block are at increased risk of death or myocardial in farction within 1 year. Other patients may present with new T wave inversions alone， which are less spe-cific， although new， deep T wave inversions of ≥2 mm across the precordium usu-ally are associated with ischemia， generally due to a severe lesion of the proximal left anterior descending artery (Wellens’syndrome). Importantly， many patients do not present with any ischemic ECG changes， so lack ofECG changes is insufficient to rule out a diagnosis ofUA/NSTEMI. In patients with ongoing chest pain suspi-cious for acute coronary syndrome (ACS)， serial ECGs should be obtained every15-30 minutes to monitor for the development of ST segment deviation.\n\n【17】Laboratory investigation is critical to differentiate between UA and NSTEMI. Clinically， UA and NSTEMI are indistinguishable. A diagnosis of NSTEMI is confirmed by the presence of positive cardiac biomarkers. Importantly， there is a time delay between when symptoms first start and the development of positive bio-markers. Contemporary cardiac biomarkers include creatine kinase (CK)， creatine kinase myocardial band (CK-MB)， troponin I (TnI)， and troponin T (TnT). CK is present throughout skeletal tissue， whereas CK-MB is more specific to cardiac muscle. Both are released during NSTEMI and are measureable within 4-6 hours， peak within the first 24 hours， and normalize by 48-72 hours. TnI and TnT are both specific and sensitive for acute myocardial infarction. They are released within4-8 hours after symptom onset and generally peak by 12-36 hours. Troponins may stay elevated for up to a week after an acute event. Given the aforementioned time delay， patients with negative cardiac biomarkers within 6 hours of symptom onset should have biomarkers remeasured within 8-12 hours after symptom onset. It is\n\n【18】**also common to trend biomarkers at 6-8-hour intervals 3 times or until levels have peaked to provide a measure of infarct size.**The differential for UA/NSTEMI is similar to STEMI that was discussed in Case 1. However， in this patient population， it is also important to explore for causes of sec-ondary UA/NSTEMI， that is， disease that precipitates myocardial ischemia due to instigating a mismatch between myocardial oxygen supply and demand. For exam-ple， patients with an underlying high-grade coronary artery stenosis that is generally asymptomatic may present with anginal chest pain if they become tachycardic with increasing oxygen demand. This can be observed in patients who present with a supraventricular tachycardia or in patients who are septic with relative hypovolemia and compensatory tachycardia. Likewise， a patient with significant acute blood loss with resultant anemia may also develop supply demand mismatch due to hypovo-lemia with tachycardia as well as decreased oxygen-carrying capacity from loss of red blood cells. Other potential diagnoses that can cause supply demand mismatch include thyrotoxicosis， hypotension， or hypoxemia. In these cases of secondary UA/NSTEMI， the primary goal is treatment of the underlying disease state. Once the patient has recovered from the acute illness， a search for significant coronary artery disease can be considered.Various risk stratification models have been developed to identify patients who are at high risk and thus may benefit from an early invasive approach with cardiac catheterization. The “thrombolysis in myocardial infarction”(TIMI) risk score is frequently used to help identify patients at high risk. Importantly， some factors in this risk score carry more weight than others. For example， patients with ST segment depression or elevated cardiac biomarkers are considered high risk regardless ofthe patient’s TIMI score.\n\n【19】Another important decision to be made when the patient initially presents is whether to pursue early invasive therapy versus an initially conservative approach. This decision depends on various factors and is summarized in Table 2-2. Patients undergoing an early invasive approach should undergo cardiac catheterization\n\n| **Table 2-2·SELECTION OF INITIAL IN VASIVE VERSUS CONSERVATIVESTRATEGY**  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Invasive**  | **Conservative**  |\n| **r ecurrent angina or ischemia despite optimizedmedical therapy**  | **Low risk score (eg， TIMI)**  |\n| **Elevated cardiac biomarkers**  | **Patient or physician preference in the** **absence ofhigh-risk features**  |\n| **New ST segment depression**  |  |\n| **Signs or symptoms of heart failure**  |  |\n| **Hemodynamic instability**  |  |\n| **Sustained ventricular tachycardia\"**  |  |\n| **Prior PCI within 6 months or history of CABG**  |  |\n| **New or worsening mitral regurgitation**  |  |\n| **High-risk score (eg， TIMI)**  |  |\n| **Left ventricular function <40%**  |  |**_\\[Data from Jheid H， Anderson JL， Wright RS， et al. 2012 ACCF/AHA focused update incorporated into the ACCF/AHA2007 guidelines for the management of patients with unstable angina/non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction.

Patients for whom a conservative strategy is chosen should be optimized medically and undergo catheterization only should they develop recurrent ischemia or symptoms on optimized therapy. Low- and intermediate-risk patients who are initially managed conservatively should also undergo cardiac stress testing. Ifhigh-risk features are present on functional testing， cardiac catheterization should be considered.\n\n【22】**With regard to antithrombotic therapy， all patients should be loaded with aspirin325 mg. Patients who undergo an initially conservative approach should be loaded with clopidogrel 600 mg or ticagrelor 180 mg (preferred). Anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin or fondaparinux is preferred， although unfractionated heparin can also be employed if needed. Patients treated with fondaparinux have a higher incidence of catheter- associated thrombosis， so if a patient treated with this agent ultimately undergoes catheterization， another anticoagulant should be used. In patients who are at higher risk (recurrent ischemic discomfort， dynamic ECG changes， or hemodynamic instability)， a 48-72-hour GP IIb/IIIa (eptifibatide or tirofiban) infusion can be considered. It should be noted that most of these higher-risk patients should then proceed to catheterization.****In addition to antiplatelet therapy described previously， a high-dose HMG-C0A(3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A) reductase inhibitor (statin)， such as atorvastatin 80 mg daily， should be prescribed on presentation even if lipids are the goal. Beta-blockers should be started as soon as feasible and maintained indefi-nitely. An angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) should also be pre-scribed indefinitely in all patients with UA/NSTEMI and heart failure， an ejection fraction <40%， hypertension， or diabetes. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are an alternative for those intolerant to ACEIs. Eplerenone， an aldosterone antago-nist， also reduces morbidity and mortality in post-infarct patients with an EF<40%， even when added in combination with ACEIs， ARBs， and beta-blockers. Low-dose aspirin should be continued indefinitely， and ADP inhibitors should be maintained for at least a year.**Complications of UA/NSTEMI are similar to those of STEMI discussed in Case 1， except that they occur much less frequently. In addition， complications that are observed more frequently in transmural infarction such as free wall rupture and ventricular septal rupture are much less common in patients with NSTEMI. Car-diogenic shock， however， can occur in up to 5% of patients with NSTEMI and is associated with greater than 60% mortality. Please refer to Case 1 for further discus-sion regarding complications of myocardial infarction.In addition to the long-term medical therapy discussed previously， other cardiac risk factors should be modified. Smoking cessation is imperative and is the most impor-tant action that a patient can take to prevent further cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Many post-myocardial infarction patients are receptive to smoking ces-sation efforts and significant time should be spent engaging them in this endeavor. If the patient has hypertension or diabetes， their blood pressure and glucose levels should be optimized. Finally， for any patient on optimal medical therapy whose ejec-tion fraction remains depressed 40 days after the event， an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) should be considered.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

They had come back  删除换行 from a hill-resort vacation two days back, where she had fainted while playing  删除换行 badminton. There were no accompanying tonic-clonic movement, tongue-bite or  删除换行 frothing at the mouth. There was no past history of seizures, syncopal episodes,  删除换行 anoxic spells or squatting attacks during early childhood. A computed tomography \n\n【4】(CT) scan of the brain and an electroencephalogram (EEG) were taken which were  删除换行 normal. The girl was referred to a cardiologist for evaluation of a heart murmur,  删除换行 which was detected by the astute neurologist. \n\n【5】On examination, pulse was of low volume at a rate of 84 beats/min. with a BP of  删除换行 104/66 mm Hg. Prominent a waves were observed in the venous pulsations at the  删除换行 neck. The apex beat was normal in location and character. A sustained left parasternal  删除换行 heave was palpable, with the inner edge of the palm. The S1 was normal and the S2 删除换行 appeared single; a right-sided S4 was heard in diastole. A long and harsh ejection  删除换行 systolic murmur was audible over the upper left parasternal area. The murmur was  删除换行 not preceded by an ejection click or accompanied by a palpable thrill and it did not  删除换行 radiate towards the carotid arteries. \n\n【6】CLINICAL DISCUSSION \n\n【7】From the history and physical examination, this young girl probably had some  删除换行 cardiac outflow tract obstruction, which led onto syncope. The most likely  删除换行 diagnosis in this case is pulmonary valve stenosis . The a waves in the  删除换行 jugular veins indicate forceful right atrial contraction against a noncompliant right  删除换行 ventricle. The parasternal heave is indicative of right ventricular hypertrophy. \n\n【8】The S2 appears single because the P2 is muffled. If P2 is audible, the splitting of \n\n【9】S2 is wide due to prolonged right ventricular (RV) ejection time. Other reasons  删除换行 for wide splitting of S2 are right bundle branch block (delayed RV activation) and  删除换行 atrial septal defect (increased RV ejection volume). \n\n【10】The long and harsh ejection systolic murmur of pulmonary stenosis indicates  删除换行 turbulent flow across the narrow valve. Length and loudness of the murmur  删除换行 correlate with the severity of stenosis but once right ventricular failure sets  删除换行 in, the murmur becomes short and soft. The systolic murmur of pulmonary  删除换行 stenosis radiates towards the back and increases in intensity during inspiration. 92 Section 6 Pulmonary Diseases\n\n【11】An ejection click and palpable thrill are less often observed compared to aortic  删除换行 stenosis. Interestingly, the ejection click of pulmonary stenosis is the only right删除8：<u>￾</u>sided heart sound that decreases during inspiration. \n\n【12】The ejection click marks the end of isovolumic contraction and heralds the  删除换行 onset of the ejection period. During inspiration, the increase in right ventricular  删除换行 end-diastolic pressure (RVEDP) leads to partial opening of the pulmonary valve  删除换行 and reduces the intensity of the ejection click. The ejection click is a feature  删除换行 of valvular stenosis and is not heard in infundibular stenosis. It also helps to  删除换行 differentiate pulmonary stenosis from atrial septal defect which produces a  删除换行 similar murmur with wide splitting of the second heart sound or S2. \n删除3：<u>Figure 20.1: Pulmonary valve stenosis </u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 20.2: ECG showing tall R waves in V1 to V3, </u>\n\n【13】with inversion of T waves \n\n【14】ECG showed tall R waves in right precordial leads with T wave inversion \n\n【15】. There was right axis deviation of the QRS complex and right atrial  删除换行 enlargement (P. pulmonale). X-ray chest findings were an enlarged right ventricle  删除换行 to the right of midline, with a dilated pulmonary artery suggestive of post-stenotic  删除换行 dilatation. The lung fields were oligemic . On ECHO, the left ventricle  删除换行 was normal in size with a normal ejection fraction and the free wall of the right  删除换行 ventricle was thickened. The mitral and aortic valves were structurally normal. \n\n【16】The pulmonary valve leaflets were mildly thickened with mild systolic doming  删除换行 and restricted excursion. On colour flow mapping, a jet was observed in the  删除换行 proximal pulmonary artery, with increased systolic velocity across the valve on \n\n【17】Doppler . Case 20 Pulmonary Stenosis 93\n\n【18】The ECG findings of right ventricular hypertophy (RVH) are tall R waves in  删除换行 lead V1, S-T segment depression and T wave inversion (RV strain) and right axis  删除换行 deviation of the QRS vector. The voltage criteria of RVH are R in V1> 4 mm, R/S  删除换行 ratio in V1> 1 and S in V6>7 mm. On chest X-ray, right ventricular enlargement and  删除换行 pulmonary artery dilatation are also seen in pulmonary hypertension but in that  删除换行 case there is pulmonary plethora and not oligemia. When pulmonary stenosis  删除换行 is a component of Fallot’s tetralogy, the pulmonary artery is small (pulmonary  删除换行 atresia) and not dilated. In pulmonary hypertension, ECHO findings are a  删除换行 pulmonary regurgitant jet on color flow mapping and increased trans-tricuspid  删除换行 flow velocity (TR Vmax).\n删除3：<u>Figure 20.4: ECHO showing a color flow map </u>\n\n【19】in proximal pulmonary artery\n删除3：<u>Figure 20.3: X-ray showing dilated pulmonary artery, </u>\n\n【20】with oligemic lung fields\n\n【21】Pulmonary stenosis needs to be clinically differentiated from other conditions  删除换行 that produce a systolic murmur over the upper left parasternal area. These clinical  删除换行 entities are pulmonary hypertension, aortic stenosis and a high cardiac output  删除换行 state. Pulmonary hypertension is also associated with clinical, electrographic and  删除换行 radiological signs of right ventricular hypertrophy  but the ejection  删除换行 murmur is accompanied by a loud P2 sound and sometimes the murmur of  删除换行 pulmonary regurgitation.

The hedgehog had not been eating well for the past 1 <sup>1 </sup> / <sub>2 </sub> weeks, and according to the clients, she had not eaten anything at all for the past 5 days. It was also noted that she was not drinking as much as usual and was having trouble walking since she had stopped eating. They described the ataxia as wobbling on her hind legs and falling to one side. The hedgehog was also defecating less often and the consistency of her feces had changed from a usually diarrhea–like consistency to a solid.\n\n【6】Her normal diet consisted of hedgehog mix and treats that included pastrami, roast beef, and hardboiled egg yolk. The hedgehog was normally housed in a clear plastic basket, with solid sides containing recycled paper as substrate. She also had a water bowl in the basket and a plastic ball to get around the house, both of which she had not been using much lately.﻿\n\n【7】Physical Examination Findings\n\n【8】The 235 g hedgehog appeared lethargic but alert and responsive. She was thin with a body condition score of 2/5 with a prominent pelvis and spine. She exhibited a plantigrade stance and was reluctant to move. She was ataxic in the hind end when she did walk.\n\n【9】Blood was collected for a complete blood count and diagnostic profile .\n删除3：<u>Fig. 6.1 . Venipuncture (right jugular vein).﻿</u>\n\n【10】Interpretive Discussion\n\n【11】The images show an eosinophil , a lymphocyte , a monocyte , a basophil , and neutrophils . The ery-throcytes in the images show increased polychromasia, 3+ anisocytosis, spherocytes, and schistocytes. Giant platelets can also be seen.\n\n【12】The hemogram indicates a relative neutrophilia and lymphopenia, indicative of a stress leukogram and normal red blood cell indices. The blood film indicates increased polychromasia and anisocytosis. The appearance of schistocytes suggests intravascular shearing of erythrocytes as would be seen in dogs with vascular neo-plasia (hemangiosarcomas), disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, or possibly iron deficiency. Spherocyte suggest immune-mediated destruction of erythrocytes (immune-mediated hemolytic anemia). The hedgehog is not currently anemic; therefore, the regenerative appearance of the erythron suggests either recovery from anemia or anemia has yet to occur. A second hemogram in 48 hours would be helpful in evaluation of the ery-thron.\n删除3：<u>Fig. 6.2 . (a–d) Blood films (Wright–Giemsa stain, 100x).</u>\n\n【13】Table 6.1 .

The hedgehog was treated at home with 7 mL of lactated Ringer’s solutions, given subcutaneously twice daily, ranitidine (3 mg/kg PO BID), trimethoprim-sulfa (15 mg/kg PO BID), and aluminum hydroxide (25 mg/kg PO with feeding up to TID).

Although it can occasionally be mildly pruritic, EPS is often asymptomatic and can be monitored.\n\n【9】Treatment of EPS can be challenging. Although it can spontaneously resolve over the course of years without complications, it can also be treated with cryotherapy, excision, pulsed dye laser or cellophane tape stripping.\n\n【10】ii. Histopathologically, EPS will demonstrate abnormal, thickened elastic fibres in the dermis and extruding through an acanthotic epidermis. Elastic tissue stains can be performed, which will highlight the thickened bulky appearance of the elastic tissue.\n\n【11】iii. Up to 40% of cases of EPS are observed within the setting of other genetic disorders including Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, Down syndrome, Marfan syndrome, Rothmund–Thomson syndrome, pseudoxanthoma elasticum and osteogenesis imperfecta.

Her parents report that for the 2 weeks prior she has complained of frontal headache that was significant enough to keep her away from school. She has had intermittent temperature elevations to 101°F (38.3°C), and she started vomiting a nonbloody, nonbilious fluid a few days ago. She has had frequent otitis media and sinusitis episodes, but her last episode of otitis media occurred approximately 5 weeks ago. On examination, you find a lethargic girl in no respiratory distress. She has a temperature of 100°F (37.7°C), heart rate 109 bpm, and blood pressure (BP) 100/60 mm Hg. She has nuchal rigidity and frontal sinus tenderness. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?\n\n【8】A. Computed tomography of the head\n\n【9】B. Intravenous promethazine for emesis\n\n【10】C. Lumbar puncture\n\n【11】D. Sinus radiographs\n\n【12】E. Trial of subcutaneous sumatriptan for migraine\n\n【13】**Answer**: 34.2 A. This girl’s history of sinusitis and a prolonged headache with worsening emesis and nuchal rigidity suggest an intracranial abscess due to her sinusitis. In her case, CNS imaging (with contrast) is performed prior to an LP. Performing an LP when a mass lesion might be causing increased intracranial pressure can result in herniation of the brain and patient death. Sinus films would show sinusitis but would not reveal an intracranial abscess. Merely treating her symptoms with promethazine or sumatriptan would delay the diagnosis of her underlying problem.\n\n【14】**Question**: 34.3 A 2-week-old infant develops a temperature to 102°F (38.9°C). Pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated. The irritable, fussy infant has a heart rate of 170 bpm and respiratory rate 40 breaths/min. The anterior fontanelle is full, but he has no nuchal rigidity; the rest of the examination is unremarkable. Which of the following is the most appropriate management of this infant?\n\n【15】A. Encourage oral fluids and office follow-up in 24 hours.\n\n【16】B. Order computed tomography of the head followed by an LP.\n\n【17】C. Perform an LP, blood culture, and urine culture, and admit to the hospital.\n\n【18】D. Prescribe intramuscular ceftriaxone and clinic follow-up in 1 week.\n\n【19】E. Prescribe oral amoxicillin and clinic follow-up in 1 week.\n\n【20】**Answer**: 34.3 C. This infant potentially has a serious bacterial infection, and an evaluation including an LP is performed. Infants do not reliably demonstrate a Kernig or Brudzinski sign; a lack of nuchal rigidity should not preclude an LP. Computed tomography scan before an LP in an infant with an open anterior fontanelle is rarely necessary, as brain herniation is exceedingly rare. A course of oral antibiotics, or a single dose of ceftriaxone, is not sufficient to treat meningitis or septicemia.\n\n【21】**Question**: 34.4 A 14-year-old boy complains of fever and stiff neck for 2 days. He has a sore throat and has been unable to eat for a day because of the pain. On examination, he is alert and oriented, but he has nuchal rigidity and posterior pharyngeal midline fullness. He drools to avoid the pain of swallowing. Which of the following is the best next step in the management of this patient?\n\n【22】A. Order computed tomography of the head.\n\n【23】B. Order lateral neck radiographs.\n\n【24】C. Perform a lumbar puncture.\n\n【25】D. Prescribe intramuscular antibiotics.\n\n【26】E. Prescribe oral antibiotics.\n**Answer**: 34.4 B. A retropharyngeal abscess is causing this boy’s neck stiffness; he does not have meningitis. He has a normal mental status, dysphagia, and fullness in his oropharynx. Lateral neck films are a simple way to confirm this diagnosis. Prescribing antibiotics without identifying the diagnosis would not be appropriate in this case.\n\n【27】CLINICAL PEARLS\n\n【28】 The typical meningitis presentation in older children consists of fever, headache, and nuchal rigidity.\n\n【29】 Nuchal rigidity is not a reliable finding of meningitis until 12 to 18 months of age.\n\n【30】 Pneumococcal disease (including meningitis) is more common in patients with functional or anatomic asplenia.\n\n【31】 Approximately one-third of meningitis patients have a seizure at some point in the disease.\n\n【32】 Typical cerebrospinal fluid findings of bacterial meningitis include elevated protein level, reduced glucose concentration, and several hundred to thousands of white blood cells per cubic millimeter.\n\n【33】#", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

It accounts for 20–50% of skin cancers, with an increasing incidence worldwide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Cumulative sun exposure (primarily ultraviolet b) is the greatest risk factor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Other risk factors include fair skin (Fitzpatrick skin types I-II), older age, immunosuppression, outdoor occupation, smoking, human papillomavirus infection (types 16, 18, and 31), exposure to arsenic and ionizing radiation, chronic skin conditions (burn scars, discoid lupus erythematosus, lichen sclerosus) and treatment with BRAF inhibitors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 – 5 \\]</u>. Familial syndromes (xeroderma pigmentosum, epidermolysis bullosa, epidermolysis verruciformis, albinism) predispose to multiple squamous cell carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Squamous cell carcinoma originates from epidermal keratinocytes or adnexal structures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. It can arise within precursor lesions (actinic keratosis, Bowen’s disease) or occur de novo 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The incidence of squamous cell carcinoma increases with age, with an average age of onset in the mid-60s. It is more common in men than women (3:1). Clinically, squamous cell carcinoma presents as a papule, plaque, or indurated nodule with a smooth, scaly, verrucous, or ulcerative surface. Lesions are typically solitary, but sometimes multiple “in transit” metastases may be present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Squamous cell carcinoma may be asymptomatic or may cause pruritus, pain or even local neuropathic symptoms if associated with perineural invasion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. In fair-skinned individuals, it typically develops in the areas of photo-damaged skin, mainly on the head and neck (55%), the extensor surfaces of hands and forearms (18%), and lower extremities (13%). Non-sun-exposed areas are the most common location among dark-skinned individuals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Histopathology is a gold standard diagnostic method in squamous cell carcinoma. Dermoscopy may be helpful to establish the initial diagnosis. Characteristic dermoscopic features of squamous cell carcinoma include scales, blood spots, white circles, white structureless areas, hairpin vessels, linear-irregular vessels, perivascular white halos, and ulceration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Management is primarily surgical, rarely followed by adjuvant chemoradiation.\n\n【27】Squamous cell carcinoma needs to be differentiated from basal cell carcinoma, Merkel cell carcinoma and skin metastasis.\n\n【28】Basal cell carcinoma is the most common skin malignancy. The incidence rate of the disease increases with age. Basal cell carcinoma presents as a tiny, hardly visible papule, growing into a nodule or a plaque that is sometimes ulcerated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Areas of the face, scalp and neck are most commonly affected.\n\n【29】Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare but highly aggressive skin cancer. The incidence of Merkel cell carcinoma increases with age and is higher in men than women. Clinically, it presents as a rapidly growing tumour or solid infiltration of the skin, red to violet in colour. The head and neck are most commonly affected. Ulceration in Merkel cell carcinoma is rarely observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】Skin metastases from primary visceral malignancy are uncommon clinical entity, with a reported incidence ranging from 0.22% to 12% of all malignancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The scalp involvement is observed in approximately 5% of cases. Cutaneous metastases usually develop a long-time after the initial diagnosis. However, sometimes they can be the first sign of an internal malignancy. Clinically, skin metastasis presents as a single or multiple non-tender nodules which are characterized by rapid growth.\n\n【31】The presented patient was diagnosed with an invasive squamous cell carcinoma and treated with complete surgical excision—T2N0M0. His lymph nodes and abdomen ultrasound as well as chest radiograph results were normal.

Upon questioning, the patient stated that there were “slivers” of foreign materials imbedded in his skin, and he insists that they must be taken out, or else “my \\[his\\] skin will not work normally.” His mental preoccupation with said slivers had been going on for about 3 years, corroborated by chronic scars running down both of his forearms.

Upon questioning, the patient stated that there were “slivers” of foreign materials imbedded in his skin, and he insists that they must be taken out, or else “my \\[his\\] skin will not work normally.” His mental preoccupation with said slivers had been going on for about 3 years, corroborated by chronic scars running down both of his forearms. Past medical history was remarkable for controlled hypertension and dyslipidemia, with no previous psychiatric history.\n\n【12】X-ray evaluation and skin biopsies showed no foreign materials. However, the patient dismissed these negative results, claiming that the slivers could not be visualized using X-rays and “are too deep to reach with the skin biopsy probes.” After much convincing on your part, he agreed to undergo empirical treatment with pimozide. Pimozide dosage was gradually titrated from a 1 mg/day to 3 mg/day; as a result, he experienced noticeable symptomatic relief. The patient happily reported spending less time trying to remove the foreign objects from his skin and more time on leisurely activities compared with before starting pimozide, and he incurred no extrapyramidal side effects during the trial period. After several months of taking pimozide at the 3 mg/day dose, he was slowly taken off the medication because his mental preoccupation and excoriating behavior had stopped.\n\n【13】Reflections on the Case\n-----------------------\n\n【14】As this and the previous two cases illustrate, there are many possible underlying psychiatric processes responsible for neurotic excoriations, including but not limited to cutaneous dysesthesia, depression, and psychosis. Therefore, it is crucial to exhaustively inquire into the cause of each patient’s excoriating behavior, since elucidating the nature of the underlying psychopathology can help you determine the most appropriate therapeutic approach. For instance, if the patient is mainly affected by cutaneous dysesthesia, then the preferred approach should involve a complete neurological evaluation and treatment with analgesics. On the other hand, if the underlying psychopathology is depression, then the first line medication to reduce depressive symptoms as well as abolish the excoriation is likely to be an anti-depressant.\n\n【15】Teaching Points\n---------------\n\n【16】Mr. Tran’s case represents a common scenario encountered by the authors. If a practitioner were to simply make a diagnosis based on the patient’s skin findings alone, then the diagnosis could well be “neurotic excoriations.” But because he also presents with a fixed delusion, a diagnosis of MHP or Morgellons Disease can also be considered. Of note, Morgellons Disease is not an officially sanctioned diagnostic term but has been commonly used by both patients and many practitioners to refer to the phenomenon, in which “fibers” allegedly extrude from the skin. Pimozide or another anti-psychotic agent (e.g. risperidone) is a logical choice as the first line treatment. When such a medication manifests its therapeutic effects, the patient typically exhibits gradual decrease in mental preoccupation about the concern, becomes less agitated, and is more able to focus on other activities. However, as stated earlier in the DoP section, he may never change his mind about the validity of the original delusional ideation.\n\n【17】Cutaneous Manifestations of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】Patients with OCD generally have more insight about their conditions than those suffering from personality disorders, depressive disorders or psychosis, etc. As a dermatology practitioner, you may encounter various skin manifestations of obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorder, ranging from acne excoriée, trichotillomania (hair pulling), onychophagia (excessive nail biting/eating) and onychotillomania (pulling of nails) to factitial dermatitis. Therapeutic options for such conditions are also varied, including mental state optimization, non-pharmacologic therapy (e.g. behavior modification therapy), pharmacotherapy, or a combination of the afore-listed approaches.\n\n【19】Generally, insight-oriented counseling may be the most critical step toward correcting this type of psychodermatologic disorder. Some patients require more in terms of therapy, such as a combination of non-pharmacologic and pharmacotherapy, to eliminate the compulsive behavior. If patients with OCD affecting the skin come to you for help, they most likely are aware of the need to stop the obsessive thoughts/compulsive behavior and might have made some effort on their own toward this goal. Insight-oriented therapy will not be as big of an issue for these patients as it is for those lacking in motivation, such as teenagers dragged into the office by their parents for help with their acne excoriée or trichotillomania. It may be wise to establish rapport with motivation-lacking patients on a one-on-one basis, so please do not be afraid to ask the guardians or any other parties to step outside the room during the medical interview.\n\n【20】One caveat to keep in mind: while patients might seek help from you regarding the cutaneous manifestations of their disease, they can be totally unaware of their non-skin-related OCD behaviors, including commonly encountered ones such as excessive hand-washing or collecting/hoarding habits. Such cases require the help of a mental health professional, such as a psychiatry practitioner, to target the pathology that runs deep beneath the surface. Another common thing to be aware of is that patients with OCD tend to begin forming compulsive behavior at a young age, and sometimes as an outlet for psychosocial disturbances (e.g. being bullied, self image issues, parents’ marital conflicts, etc.). Considering the global context of their OCD behaviors, please ask the patients and their families for permission to involve other types of mental health consultants. This can optimize the therapeutic outcome of whatever you are able to provide them.\n\n【21】In the following cases, we hope to illustrate common scenarios of the obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorder manifesting as dermatoses, as well as offer concrete examples of therapeutic approaches to eliminate compulsive behaviors involving the ski", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health has set standards for anesthetic gas levels in the operating room. For example， there is to be no more than 2 ppm (parts per million) of a volatile anesthetic if used alone， and no more than 0.5 ppm of a volatile anesthetic when used in con-junction with nitrous oxide in the operating room. The maximum amount of nitrous oxide allowed in the operating room is 25 ppm(50 ppm in the dental office).\n\n【19】**Clinical Pearls**\n\n【20】删除17：<u>一</u>Routine check of anesthesia equipment is mandatory.\n\n【21】\\>Ambu bag and oxygen tent are essential equipment in case of machine failure.\n\n【22】**REFERENCE**\n\n【23】Design Guidelines for Effective Anesthesia Apparatus Checkout. 删除9：<u>www.asahq.org/clinical/FINALCheckoutDesignguidelines02-08-2008.pdf.</u>\n\n【24】Part 3.The Patient Undergoing Anesthesia", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

It is performed to reduce the patient’s risk of mor-bidity and mortality when undergoing surgery， and to promote efficiency and reduce costs by minimizing delays and cancellations in the operating room on the day of surgery. 通用删除1(英):<u>(Please see Table 9-1.)</u> In contrast to the history performed by a primary care provider during which chronic conditions are documented carefully， the anesthesia preoperative evaluation focuses on the current functional status of the patient and how their chronic diseases may limit the patient's functionality. For example， the relevance of this patient's arthritis to the anesthesiologist is mostly the impact on the patient's functional capacity and mobility， as well as any potential difficulties with the airway that may occur， as opposed to the long-term prognosis of a patient’s chronic condition. It is also important to determine whether the arthritis impairs the patient's ability to open his mouth or extend his neck， both of which are important to ensure a successful intubation.**Table 9-1 THE GOALS OF PREOPERATIVE ASSESSMENT**\n\n【8】1\\. To obtain a history of the patient's medical condition and relevant anesthesia history， and to complete a physical examination targeting the airway and relevant systems such as the cardiopulmonary status of the patient.\n\n【9】2\\. To recommend further testing or consultation as needed to optimize the patient for the anesthesia and surgery.\n\n【10】3\\. To obtain informed consent from the patient or health care proxy.\n\n【11】4\\. To allay anxiety and educate patients and their families about anesthesia.\n\n【12】5\\. To implement risk reduction strategies as appropriate.At a minimum， the patient's physical examination should include vital signs， height and weight， an airway examination， and auscultation of the heart and lungs. For the anesthesiologist， the airway examination is a vital component of the examination， for failure to secure an airway during the procedure may result in catastrophic consequences. The components of an airway examination include determining the Mallampati classification of the oral cavity (please see Case 10)， the degree of neck flexion， head extension， thyromental distance， and dental status. Other factors such as body habitus and heavy facial hair may also affect the anesthesiologist's ability to mask and intubate the patient. If a difficult intubation is anticipated， the option of an awake fiberoptic intubation should be discussed with the patient. If applicable， other methods of anesthesia besides general anesthesia should also be considered at this time.Diagnostic tests can aid in the risk assessment for anesthesia and surgery， guide interventions to optimize medical conditions， and provide baseline results for perioperative management. However， screening tests can yield false positive results that may result in further morbidity in patients without a med-ical indication due to an unnecessary follow up. Pre-anesthetic testing should only be performed when indicated by the patient's underlying medical condi-tion. Indications for common tests are described in Table 9-2.\n\n| Table 9-2 PREOPERATIVE TESTING  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Hematocrit (Hct)  | Hct should be ordered if there is likelihood of unexpectedor symptomatic anemia， or significant blood loss is antici-pated. If significant blood loss is possible， a type and screenor crossmatch is also indicated.  |\n| Coagulation studies(PT， PTT，INR)  | Coagulation studies should be ordered if patient's historysuggests a coagulation disorder (such as hemophilia， vonWillebrand disease)， liver disease，malnutrition or malabsorp-tion， or if the patient is on anticoagulants.  |\n| Chemistries(electrolytes， BUN， creatinine，glucose)  | Chemistries should be ordered if patient has known kidneydisease， has risk factors for renal dysfunction (eg，age >55，diabetes， vascular disease， lupus)，is on diuretics， or will beexposed to radiographic dye. Liver function tests are generallynot required， although a low albumin has been associatedwith increased morbidity and mortality in ill patients，andmay be requested to establish a baseline.  |\n| ECG  | An electrocardiogram is one of the only tests that may beordered based on both the medical history and age. In gen-eral the incidence of cardiac disease rises steadily with ageand baseline.ECGs are often ordered for males over 45 yearsand females 55 years in age. An ECG should also be orderedfor patients with cardiac disease or symptoms of cardiacdisease.  |\n| Chest x-ray (CXR)  | Routine screening chest x-rays are not recommended beforesurgery. A CXR is only indicated in patients who have clinicalevidence of active pulmonary disease (eg，pneumonia，pul-monary edema， a mediastinal mass) or are undergoing anintrathoracic procedure.  |Cardiac complications are the most significant adverse events in the periop-erative period. The preoperative evaluation should be used to identify LIO11patients with modifiable conditions or those at a high risk for perioperative cardiac events. The guidelines for cardiac evaluation before non-cardiac sur-gery by the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association(ACC/AHA) are the national standards of care and are organized in a step-wise approach.\n\n【14】STEP 1. Determine the urgency of the proposed surgery. If the patient needs emergent surgery， the focus is on perioperative surveillance and risk reduction measures such as serial ECGs， cardiac enzymes， adequate pain control， and beta blockers to control heart rate.\n\n【15】STEP 2. Determine if the patient has an active cardiac condition such as an acute MI， unstable or severe angina， decompensated heart failure， severe valvular disease， or significant arrhythmias (eg， ventricular tachycardia and rapid atrial fibrillation). For these patients， surgery should be postponed except for life-saving emergencies.\n\n【16】STEP 3. Determine the severity of the proposed surgery. The ACC/AHA cat-egorizes surgical procedures into three categories： low-， intermediate-， and high risk. Low-risk surgeries include endoscopic procedures， breast and super ficial surgeries， and most ambulatory procedures. Intermediate-risk surgeries include most orthopedic and intraperitoneal surgeries. High-risk surgeries include aortic or vascular surgeries. Patients with no active cardiac conditions who need low-risk surgery do not need further cardiac testing.\n\n【17】STEP 4. Assess the patient’s functional capacity. A common way to assess a patient's functional status is by estimating a patient's exercise tolerance in metabolic equivalents or METs. Asymptomatic patients who have a func-tional status greater than 4 METs， which is roughly equivalent to walking up two flights of stairs， can proceed with surgery without any additional cardiac workup.To avoid the risk of pulmonary aspiration， patients should receive NPO instructions prior to the surgery. The ASA task force on preoperative fasting currently recommends a fasting of solids and nonhuman milk to exceed6 hours prior to any procedure requiring general anesthesia， regional anesthesia， or sedation/analgesia. Fasting rules have been liberalized at most centers to allow clear liquids (water， carbonated beverages， sports drinks， coffee or tea without milk) up to 2 hours before surgery in patients who are not at risk of delayed gastric emptying. To avoid confusion， patients should receive a writ-ten copy of all instructions. Some institutions may adhere to stricter guide-lines such as NPO after midnight except for sips of clear liquids when taking medications， or allowing clear liquids up to 4 hours before surgery for surgery scheduled late in the day.\n\n【18】For pediatric patients， clear liquids may be taken up to 2 hours before sur-gery. Breast milk is allowed until 4 hours before surgery； formula or nonhuman milk should be held for 6 hours preoperatively.1\\. Cardiac and antihypertensive medications： In general， all antihypertensive medications should be continued through the morning of surgery. Stopping beta blockers or alpha-2 agonists (clonidine) may result in rebound hyper-tension. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers have been associated with prolonged and resistant hypotension after induction of anesthesia. Currently， whether or not these drugs should be held prior to surgery is controversial within the anesthesiol-ogy community and practice varies widely. Diuretics can be held on the morning of surgery provided they have not been prescribed for congestive failure. Patients with cardiovascular disease taking statin drugs， beta block-ers， digoxin， antiarrhythmics， and antiplatelet agents should continue taking these medications because discontinuation can have detrimental effects.\n\n【19】2\\. Aspirin， antiplatelet agents such as clopidogrel， low-molecular-weight heparin， and warfarin： The decision to discontinue these medications， in general， depends on the surgeon's preference and the type of surgery. AnticoagulationWhenever a decision is made to hold these agents， it is important to carefully weigh the risks and potential benefits， and to involve the patient’s cardiologist or primary care physicians. There may be an increased risk of vascular events if chronic aspirin or antiplatelet medications are stopped perioperatively. In general， for high-risk patients such as those with cardiac or vascular disease， renal insufficiency， and diabetes， aspirin should not be stopped for procedures with minimal bleeding such as cataract surgery or endoscopies. If there is concern over significant blood loss such as may occur in intracranial surgery， stopping aspirin for 3 to 4 days prior to sur-gery should be sufficient.\n\n【20】For patients with recently placed coronary stents (<1 year)， aspirin and clopidogrel should not be stopped unless absolutely contraindicated， and then， only with the coordination of the patient's cardiologist. Premature discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy may result in stent thrombosis，MI， and/or death. If a patient can stop warfarin safely， it should be held for at least four doses to allow the INR (international normalized ratio) to nor-malize (<1.5). If the INR remains elevated on the day of surgery， fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K can be given to reverse anticoagulation. Low-molecular-weight heparin should be held for at least 12 to 24 hours before surgery or neuraxial anesthesia to minimize the risk of surgical bleeding and epidural or spinal hematomas.\n\n【21】3\\. Antiseizure， antipsychotics， narcotics， and medications for asthma and heartburn should be continued on the day of surgery.\n\n【22】4\\. Herbs and non-vitamin supplements should be stopped 1 week prior to sur-gery since they may interact with perioperative medications and some may cause increased risk of bleeding.After the patient has been fully evaluated， the anesthesiologist assigns a physical status to the patient based on his or her medical condition. The American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) Physical Status Classification System ranks patients for risk of adverse events during a surgical procedure.  This assignment is based on the physical condition of the patient， and is inde-pendent of the surgical procedure. The grading system ranks patients from ASA 1， denoting a normal and healthy patient， to ASA 5， signifying a mori-bund patient who is not expectedto survive without the operation. Intraoperative adverse events are encountered more frequently in patients with a poor physical status， greater or equal to ASA 3， especially in emergency situations. Some examples of patients that have a poor physical status who are at high risk for anesthesia and surgery include patients with active heart dis-ease (CHF aortic stenosis)， chronic renal disease， end-stage liver disease， and patients scheduled for surgery who are already in the intensive care unit.\n\n| Table 9-3 ASA PHYSICAL STATUS CLASSIFICATION  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ASA1  | Normal healthy patient  |\n| ASA 2  | Patients with mild systemic disease with no functional limitations  |\n| ASA3  | Patients with systemic disease with functional limitations  |\n| ASA4  | Patients with severe systemic disease that is a constant threat to life  |\n| ASA5  | Moribund patients who are not expected to survive without intervention.  |\n| “E”  | The suffix\"E\"is attached to the ASA classification for all emergent procedures，that is， ASA 3E  |In summary， the preoperative evaluation consists of a history， physical examination， relevant laboratory tests， and consultations which allow the anesthesiologist to assess the patient's physical status and optimize his or her medical condition preoperatively. Using this information， an appropriate anesthetic plan is formed by the anesthesiologist， the patient is educated about anesthesia， and informed consent is obtained. Successful preoperative assessment and management of the patient in the preoperative period may result in decreased perioperative morbidity and mortality， as well as an improved efficiency in the operating room.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

How would you manage this patient acutely, and what would you consider when  删除换行 making decisions on treatment?删除5：<u>104</u>\n删除7：<u>100 Cases in Emergency Medicine and Critical Care</u>\nDISCUSSION\n\n【17】The ECG shows an irregularly irregular rhythm with no evidence of P waves, as well as tachy删除8：<u>￾</u>cardia, consistent with atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular rate, colloquially known  删除换行 as ‘fast AF’. AF is the commonest cardiac arrhythmia and is frequently encountered in the \n\n【18】ED as well as in inpatient wards. It arises as a result of ectopic atrial activity from sites other  删除换行 than the sinoatrial node, with not all beats being captured by the ventricles, thereby leading  删除换行 to an irregular rate and lack of P waves on the ECG. It is associated with several conditions,  删除换行 including structural and valvular heart disease, ischaemic heart disease, cardiomyopathy,  删除换行 obstructive lung disease, metabolic disorders (e.g. hyperthyroidism), electrolyte abnormali删除8：<u>￾</u>ties (e.g. hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia) and acute illness (e.g. sepsis, postoperative state). \n\n【19】This patient has a history of alcoholism and findings consistent with alcoholic cirrhosis and  删除换行 therefore likely has some degree of alcoholic cardiomyopathy, thereby predisposing him to  删除换行 development of AF. An additional trigger may be his acute illness, with the evidence of a low删除8：<u>￾</u>grade fever and abdominal pain in a patient with ascites pointing towards possible spontane删除8：<u>￾</u>ous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).\n\n【20】The initial evaluation of this patient should include checking a full blood count, electro删除8：<u>￾</u>lytes including magnesium, clotting screen, thyroid function and a chest radiograph. If  删除换行 there were suspicion for cardiac ischaemia or heart failure, it would be reasonable to check  删除换行 cardiac enzymes and a BNP. A transthoracic echo should also be arranged but is not required  删除换行 emergently. In this patient, an ascitic tap should also be performed to look for SBP.\n\n【21】The acute management of the patient should proceed along the ‘ABCDE’ approach, with  删除换行 delivery of supplemental oxygen (given saturation of <94% on air). The patient appears to be  删除换行 relatively haemodynamically stable despite the tachycardia, and therefore heart rate control  删除换行 would be warranted, with the aim to control rates to 110 or less. This can be achieved through  删除换行 use of calcium channel blockers or beta-blockers (e.g. IV diltiazem infusion or IV metoprolol  删除换行 boluses, followed by oral medication); digoxin may also be used, particularly in patients with  删除换行 evidence or history of heart failure.\n\n【22】The other treatment approach in patients with AF is restoration of sinus rhythm via electrical  删除换行 or chemical cardioversion. Electrical (DC) cardioversion should be performed emergently  删除换行 in patients with AF who are unstable (e.g. hypotension, evidence of heart failure or organ  删除换行 hypoperfusion), but the downside is that cardioversion may lead to systemic embolisation of  删除换行 a left atrial thrombus, assuming that the patient has had AF for a sustained period of time. \n\n【23】If it can be confidently assumed that the patient has been in AF for less than 48 hours (i.e. \n\n【24】via documentation of rhythm through ECGs or symptoms), cardioversion is appropriate,  删除换行 but it should otherwise be deferred until a transoesophageal echocardiogram is performed  删除换行 to confirm the absence of atrial thrombus or until the patient has been anti coagulated for a  删除换行 period of at least 3 weeks. In this case, it is quite likely that the patient has had AF for a rea删除8：<u>￾</u>sonable period of time given the likelihood of alcoholic cardiomyopathy, and since there is  删除换行 no evidence that AF is new onset, cardioversion should be deferred in favour of rate control  删除换行 unless he became unstable.\n\n【25】The final consideration in patients with AF is anticoagulation, as they are at risk for sys删除8：<u>￾</u>temic embolisation and stroke (due to stasis of blood in the left atrium). This can be assessed  删除换行 through use of the CHADSVASC and HASBLED scores, which predict risk of thrombosis  删除换行 without anticoagulation and bleeding, respectively.删除5：<u>105</u>\nCase 30: An abnormal ECG\n\n【26】Key Points\n\n【27】• An irregularly irregular rhythm with an absence of P waves on the ECG is consistent  删除换行 with atrial fibrillation (AF).\n\n【28】• AF with rapid ventricular rates is generally managed with control of heart rates  删除换行 through use of beta-blockers or calcium-channel blockers.\n\n【29】• Unstable patients with AF may require electrical cardioversion to restore sinus  删除换行 rhythm.删除9：<u>http://taylorandfrancis.com107</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Viruses infect all types of cells: prokaryotic, eukaryotic, animal and plant. All viruses contain a viral genome, although the nature of the nucleic acid is quite variable. All viruses enclose their genetic information inside a protein shell known as a capsid . Some, but not all, viruses surround the capsid with a phospholipid bilayer “borrowed” from the previous host cell. Viruses with an outer membrane are enveloped viruses while viruses that only have capsids are nonenveloped viruses .\n\n【4】The life cycle of a virus starts with attachment and entry of the virus into a host cell. Viruses take advantage of proteins or other molecules that are normally present on the surface of the cell as points of attachment. Once a virus has attached to the surface of a cell, the viral capsid can gain entry into the cell’s cytoplasm either through membrane fusion, in the case of enveloped viruses, or through endocytosis , in the case of nonenveloped viruses. The capsid delivers viral genetic information into the cell where it can be replicated, transcribed, and translated. Production of viral proteins occurs in the same manner as translation of the host cell’s own proteins. Newly synthesized capsid and other viral proteins assemble with newly replicated viral genetic information, forming new viral particles which then exit the cell, spread, and infect new host cells.\n\n【5】▪ Conduct a search for each of the viruses listed below.

Approximately 90% of the capsid is made up of a 67 kDa protein known as viral protein 2 ( VP2 ) with the remaining 10% being composed of the 83 kDa viral protein 1 ( VP1 ). The amino acid sequence of VP1 is almost identical to that of VP2 with the exception of a 143 amino acid sequence at the amino-terminal domain. This unique amino-terminal sequence shares some homologies with a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and phospholipase A2 , an enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of phospholipids. Protein folding of VP1 sequesters the amino-terminal domain; however, when exposed to high temperatures or acidic pH, VP1 changes its conformation, exposing the amino-terminus.\n\n【15】CPV gains entry into cells through an attachment to transferrin receptors ( TfRs ). TfRs function to bind and transport the iron-binding protein transferrin into the cell. TfRs are brought into the cell through the process of receptor-mediated endocytosis . Following internalization from the cell surface, TfRs are transported through the endocytic pathway, eventually recycling back to the cell surface. Viruses that enter a cell through endocytosis must be able to exit out of the membrane compartments of the endocytic pathway and enter the cytoplasm of the cell in order for them to gain access to the cellular components they need to reproduce.\n\n【16】▪ What is the relationship between a “negative-sense” DNA sequence and the sequence of the mRNA required to synthesize viral proteins?\n\n【17】▪ Outline the steps involved in viral protein synthesis starting with a viral mRNA and ending with a capsid protein.\n\n【18】▪ Explain how exposure to high temperatures or acidic pH would alter protein folding.\n\n【19】▪ Describe how a NLS functions.\n\n【20】▪ Research/review the steps involved in TfR-mediated endocytosis. Follow the receptor from the cell surface, into the cell, and back to the cell surface.\n\n【21】Methods\n-------\n\n【22】### Cells and viruses\n\n【23】Norden Laboratories feline kidney (NLFK) cells were grown in culture. Canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-d) was grown in NLFK cells in 175 cm <sup>2 </sup> cell culture flasks for 5–7 days then stored at −20°C. To harvest viruses, 300 mL of thawed culture medium was centrifuged at 3000 g for 30 min and the supernatant was concentrated with a 500 kDa filter. Viruses were pelleted by centrifugation at 173,000 g for 2 h and resuspended in a saline buffer.\n\n【24】To generate heat-treated CPV, capsids were incubated for 2 min on a 65°C heat block. Samples were allowed to gradually cool to room temperature before being used for infection studies.\n\n【25】### Lysosomal drugs\n\n【26】Various compounds known to influence endocytosis and lysosomal function were used in these studies. Bafilomycin (BFLA) is an antibiotic that is known to block the activity of H <sup>+ </sup> \\-ATPases. Similarly, amiloride (AMI) blocks sodium channels and the activity of sodium/hydrogen antiporters. Monensin (MON) is an ionophore and can disrupt protein transport in the cell. Finally, Brefeldin A (BFA) inhibits protein transport from the rough endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi complex. Concentrations used of each compound are indicated in the experiments.\n\n【27】### Microscopy\n\n【28】Immunofluorescence microscopy studies were performed on 80% confluent NLFK cells grown on coverslips. Cells were inoculated with CPV particles in the absence or presence of lysosome-inhibiting drugs . Drugs were added to the cell 30 min prior to infection and maintained until fixation. Cells were fixed at different post infection times. Fixed cells were permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 for 15 min and then incubated with primary antibody for 45 min at room temperature. Samples were rinsed well before addition of a fluorescently labeled secondary antibody. CPV was imaged using a polyclonal antibody to VP1 and VP2 capsid proteins. The amino-terminus of VP1 was visualized using a monoclonal antibody specific to that domain of the protein. Monoclonal antibodies to lysosomal membrane protein-2 (LAMP-2) and TfR were also used in these studies.\n\n【29】Immunoelectron microscopy was used to identify the subcellular localization of CPV capsid protein. Cells were incubated in the presence or absence of lysosome-inhibiting drugs 30 min prior to infection with CPV particles. Cells were incubated for 20 h then fixed and permeabilized using a combination of 0.01% saponin and 0.05% Triton X-100. Cells were incubated with primary antibody to CPV capsid protein for 1 h, washed, and then incubated with gold-labeled secondary antibody. Cells were washed again and postfixed in preparation for the dehydration, infiltration, and embedding steps required for electron microscopy. Embedded samples were cut into 50 nm sections and viewed using a transmission electron microscope.\n\n【30】### Assay of CPV infectivity\n\n【31】Infected cells were incubated for 20 h, after which the number of fluorescent nuclei were determined using a monoclonal antibody to CPV. The level of infectivity was quantified as the ratio of cells with fluorescent nuclei to total number of fluorescent cells ( n \\= 300). Infectivity was assayed for native and heat-treated CPV as well as heat-treated CPV in the presence of lysosome-inhibiting drugs.\n\n【32】### Dextran particle release assay\n\n【33】NLFK cells were grown on coverslips as described earlier. Cells were exposed to 3 mg/mL rhodamine-conjugated dextran ( M <sub><span class=\"italic\">r </span></sub> 3000 or 10,000) for 15 min in the presence or absence of lysosome-inhibiting drugs. The dextran-containing media was removed and replaced with fresh media without dextran or CPV, but containing the same concentration of drugs found in the original solution. Cells were maintained for 8 or 20 h post infection. Controls were made without the addition of CPV. Cells were fixed and imaged using a fluorescence microscope. On its own, dextran cannot easily pass through the membranes of the endosome or lysosome. The percentage of cells showing cytoplasmic and/or nuclear fluorescence was calculated based on approximately 1500 cells/sample.\n\n【34】▪ What conclusion(s) can you draw from the fact that CPV can infect feline cells?\n\n【35】▪ Connect the life cycle of a virus with the ability of the researchers to harvest parvovirus from tissue culture media.\n\n【36】▪ Relate how the mode of action of each of the drugs used in the study would ultimately influence lysosomal function.\n\n【37】▪ Why is it necessary to permeabilize cells for the immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy protocols, but not for the dextran protocol?\n\n【38】Results\n-------\n\n【39】▪ What is the earliest time point during endocytosis at which the N-terminus of VP1 becomes accessible to antibody binding .\n\n【40】▪ Summarize the information provided in Figure 15.3.1 a.

During one experiment, he measures the partial oxygen pressure in various fetal vessels. His results are as follows:\n\n【1】> Vessel A: 20 mm Hg\n\n【2】> Vessel B: 27 mm Hg\n\n【3】> Vessel C: 35 mm Hg\n\n【4】> Vessel D: 12 mm Hg\n\n【5】> The vessel labeled C will develop into which structure in the adult?\n\n【6】> (A) Falciform ligament\n\n【7】> (B) Ligamentum teres hepatis\n\n【8】> (C) Ligamentum venosum\n\n【9】> (D) Medial umbilical ligament\n\n【10】> (E) Median umbilical ligament\n\n【11】 **Answer**: The correct answer is B. The vessel labeled C is most likely the umbilical vein, which has the highest oxygen saturation level in the fetus. It carries blood enriched in oxygen from the placenta to the fetus. Its oxygen saturation is typically between 30 and 35 mm Hg. Soon after birth, the umbilical vein becomes dysfunctional as the neonate makes the transition from fetal circulation to that found in adult anatomy. In place of this vein is a fibrous structure, the ligamentum teres hepatis, or the round ligament of the liver. It extends from the umbilicus to the transverse fissure of the liver, where it joins the ligamentum venosum, thus effectively separating the liver into its right and left lobes. Recanalization of this vein occurs under the pathologic condition of portal hypertension associated with liver cirrhosis.  \n\n【12】Answer A is incorrect. The falciform ligament is a developmental remnant of the ventral mesentery of the fetus, thus it is a peritoneal fold enclosing the round ligament of the liver anteriorly and the ligamentum venosum posteriorly.  \n\n【13】Answer C is incorrect. The ligamentum venosum is a fibrous structure that is derived from the ductus venosus in the fetal circulatory system. The ductus venosus is a shunt that conducts oxygen-rich blood from the umbilical vein into the inferior vena cava. It may be associated with the round ligament of the liver, coursing through the fissure that demarcates the boundaries between the left and caudate lobes of the liver. Most often, it is found attached to the left branch of the portal vein in the porta hepatis.  \n\n【14】Answer D is incorrect. There are two medial umbilical ligaments in the adult. They course longitudinally on the deep surface of the anterior abdominal wall underneath the medial umbilical folds. The medial umbilical ligaments represent vestigial remnants of the fetal umbilical arteries. The paired umbilical arteries have a very low oxygen saturation level (vessel D), as they carry blood depleted of oxygen from the fetus back to the placenta.  \n\n【15】Answer E is incorrect. The median umbilical ligament is a single ligament that runs longitudinally on the deep surface of the anterior abdominal wall between the medial umbilical ligaments in the adult, extending from the apex of the bladder to the umbilicus. It is a vestigial remnant of the embryonic urachus.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Upon returning home, he did  删除换行 not experience any angina, dyspnea, palpitation or syncope. Medications prescribed  删除换行 to him were aspirin 150 mg, clopidogrel 75 mg, ramipril 5 mg, atorvastatin 20 mg  删除换行 and metoprolol 50 mg. \n\n【4】On examination, the patient was alert, comfortable and not tachypneic.

The \n\n【6】JVP was not raised and there was no hepatomegaly or ankle edema. On precordial  删除换行 examination, the apex beat was diffuse in nature and displaced towards the left  删除换行 axilla. The S1\n\n【7】 and S2\n\n【8】 heart sounds were normal but a soft S3\n\n【9】 was audible in diastole. \n\n【10】There was no murmur or pericardial rub audible. Few inspiratory crackles were heard  删除换行 over the lower lung fields posteriorly. \n\n【11】ECG showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 92 beats/min. and an occasional unifocal  删除换行 ventricular premature beat was seen. No couplet or bigeminal rhythm was noticed. \n\n【12】There was complete attenuation of the R waves with deep Q waves in the precordial  删除换行 leads V1\n\n【13】 to V4\n\n【14】. Small q waves were also seen in leads V5\n\n【15】 and V6\n\n【16】 . There was  删除换行 coving of the S-T segment with inversion of the T wave in all the precordial leads. The \n\n【17】Q-T interval was normal. \n\n【18】ECHO showed a dilated left ventricle with depressed systolic function (ejection  删除换行 fraction 35%). The mid and distal segments of the interventricular septum, the left  删除换行 ventricular apex and the distal segment of the lateral wall were hypokinetic but no  删除换行 dyskinetic area was identified. A well-defined rounded mass was seen arising from  删除换行 the ventricular apex and protruding into the left ventricular cavity . The  删除换行 echogenicity of the mass was variable and it did not move in synchrony with the  删除换行 ventricle. The posterior mitral leaflet failed to reach the plane of the mitral annulus  删除换行 and the leaflet coaptation point was distally located in the ventricle. The aortic valve  删除换行 leaflets were mildly thickened but had normal excursion without systolic doming. \n\n【19】No pericardial effusion was noted. 152 Section 10 Intracardiac Masses\n\n【20】CLINICAL DISCUSSION\n\n【21】From the history and physical examination as well as from the ECG and ECHO  删除换行 findings, this elderly gentleman had sustained a recent extensive anterior wall  删除换行 myocardial infarction. He had now developed left ventricular systolic dysfunction  删除换行 and a ventricular thrombus. Two weeks after acute myocardial infarction (MI) \n\n【22】usual complications include post-MI angina, malignant ventricular arrhythmias  删除换行 and left ventricular failure. Sometimes, a ventricular thrombus may form on an  删除换行 infarcted and scarred myocardial segment or within a left ventricular aneurysm. \n\n【23】This patient did not demonstrate any dyskinetic myocardial segment and there  删除换行 was no outward bulge of the left ventricular cavity. A fragment of the ventricular  删除换行 thrombus may break away and travel through the systemic circulation to cause  删除换行 embolization in any distal vascular bed. \n\n【24】A dilated left ventricle with reduced systolic wall motion and stagnated  删除换行 blood flow, is an ideal setting for ventricular thrombus formation. A ventricular  删除换行 thrombus may form on a dyskinetic, infarcted and scarred myocardial segment or  删除换行 within a left ventricular aneurysm. Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy is another  删除换行 important reason for ventricular thrombus formation. \n\n【25】A pedunculated ventricular thrombus appears as a well-defined, rounded,  删除换行 mobile stalked mass, that protrudes into the ventricular cavity. The mobility of  删除换行 the thrombus is not synchronous with the left ventricular free wall motion. It is \n删除3：<u>Figure 33.1: ECG showing R wave attenuation, deep Q waves </u>\n\n【26】with S-T segment coving and T wave inversion\n删除3：<u>Figure 33.2: ECHO showing a dilated, hypokinetic left ventricle </u>\n\n【27】with a mural thrombus arising from the apexCase 33 Ventricular Thrombus 153 删除换行 more likely to embolize if the echodensity is variable due to areas of necrosis. \n\n【28】A mural ventricular thrombus is a flat, laminated mass, contiguous with the  删除换行 ventricular wall with which it moves synchronously. It is more echogenic than  删除换行 the adjacent myocardium and less likely to embolize than a pedunculated  删除换行 thrombus. Thrombus always has a clear identifiable edge while an artefact caused  删除换行 by stagnated blood has a hazy appearance. On color flow mapping, the flow stops  删除换行 abruptly at the edge of a thrombus but not at the edge of an artefact. \n\n【29】Left ventricular thrombus is a masquerader of several other mass lesions. \n\n【30】Causes of a mass in the left ventricle are rhabdomyoma, false tendon and  删除换行 prominent papillary muscle. Mural thrombus can be distinguished from localized  删除换行 myocardial thickening by the fact that myocardium thickens during systole while  删除换行 a thrombus does not. Thrombus can be differentiated from a cardiac tumor by the  删除换行 fact that adjacent wall motion is almost always abnormal in case of thrombus and  删除换行 often normal in case of tumor. \n\n【31】MANAGEMENT ISSUES \n\n【32】Presence of a ventricular thrombus is an established indication for oral  删除换行 anticoagulant therapy. Other clear indications for anticoagulation are mechanical  删除换行 prosthetic heart valve, left atrial thrombus with mitral stenosis and ventricular  删除换行 aneurysm. When an oral anticoagulant like warfarin is initiated, it takes 3 to 5  删除换行 days for the onset of full therapeutic effect. In this interim period, heparin therapy  删除换行 may be given. Unfractionated heparin requires monitoring but it is cost effective. \n\n【33】Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is more expensive, but it does not require  删除换行 prothrombin time (PT) or aPTT monitoring. \n\n【34】It is now widely recommended that every myocardial infarction patient  删除换行 must receive aspirin, a statin, an ACE-inhibitor and a beta-blocker. Our patient  删除换行 had already been prescribed all these drugs. A diuretic can be added to reduce  删除换行 cardiac work-load, if pulmonary congestive symptoms develop. An aldosterone  删除换行 antagonist such as spironolactone or eplerenone can also be used. These drugs,  删除换行 besides reducing cardiac work-load, improve ventricular remodelling and lower  删除换行 cardiovascular mortality.

After applying the topical corticosteroids, the skin is covered with large sheets of saran wrap, which sticks well to the ointment without the use of adhesive tape.\n\n【8】After 1 week of the above procedure all day each day, the intense inflammation begins to resolve and the skin is no longer red and only pink. At this time, NB-UVB is initiated at 30 mJ/cm <sup>2 </sup> . The first 3 phototherapy sessions are kept stable at 30 mJ/cm <sup>2 </sup> and is tolerated by the patient without any burning symptoms or other signs that the light is aggravating the inflammation. The dose is then gradually increased very cautiously by 10–30 mJ/cm <sup>2 </sup> as tolerated, which is at a rate that is much slower than the usual dosing increment schedule. At the same time, the above cooling procedure is continued only at home. It is made sure that topical agents are not present on the skin at the time of the actual phototherapy session to ensure reasonably constant penetration of the light into the skin.\n\n【9】After 2 weeks, the erythema becomes very mild and she is able to stop the “cool down” procedure at home and instead use topical corticosteroids as needed to the affected areas. NB-UVB is continued at a frequency of 3 times per week, which is tolerated well. At 8 week follow up, the patient is tolerating NB-UVB per the usual protocol and is almost completely clear.\n\n【10】Discussion\n----------\n\n【11】It is critical for every phototherapy provider to know that extremely intense erythema, such as in this case of erythroderma , is a contraindication to any type of phototherapy, be it NB-UVB, BB-UVB, PUVA, or excimer laser 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Phototherapy, in reality, is a “double-edged sword” as it can either help or aggravate inflammation. This is easily observable by the fact that natural sunlight generally helps patients with psoriasis by decreasing skin inflammation but not if the patient gets sunburned. In fact, serious sunburn can cause Koebnerization and result in worsening of psoriasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. This implies that light therapy helps decrease inflammatory intensity until a threshold dose is reached when it turns into a pro-inflammatory force (i.e. sunburn).\n删除3：<u>Figure 11.1\n\n【12】Patient with erythrodermic psoriasis requiring a “cool down” procedure prior to starting any kind of phototherapy\n</u>\nThe pro-inflammatory potential of phototherapy is most concerning if the patient is already extremely intensely inflamed at the time of presentation. Clinically, this “over the top” intensity can be readily identified by the “bright red” or “beefy red” coloration of the erythema . If such a patient were to receive phototherapy by error, the intensity of inflammation can become so severe to the point that the patient may have to be hospitalized with whole body edema, pain, and other complications. Therefore, it is crucial not to rush into phototherapy if the patient appears erythrodermic or near erythrodermic. It is worth emphasizing that “erythrodermic” psoriasis needs not involve 100% of the body surface area. Since psoriasis tends to spare the face, it is not unusual for a patient to present with nearly whole body erythroderma but sparing the face and possible a few other locations.\n删除3：<u>Figure 11.2\n\n【13】Patient with severely inflamed, “beefy” and bright red psoriasis requiring “cool down” prior to starting phototherapy\n</u>\nThe above phenomenon whereby the most intensely erythematous skin can be made more inflammatory by phototherapy also applies to patient who have localized but bright red lesions; the intensity of the inflammation is key, not the amount of body surface area involved. Therefore, if a patient were to present with the most unusually intense inflammation of, for example, hand and foot psoriasis or eczema, it is still necessary to “cool down” the skin down before starting hand/foot PUVA or other light treatments. Another type of intensely inflamed psoriasis requiring “cool down” or avoidance of phototherapy all together is pustular psoriasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】The “cool down” procedure can be conducted by using liberal amounts of topical corticosteroids as explained above. Triamcinolone 0.01% ointment is most commonly used at the UCSF Phototherapy Unit as it can be dispensed in one-pound jars as opposed to tubes, which allows for easier and more generous application. Alternatively, “cool down” can be performed using a rapid-acting systemic mediation, namely cyclosporine, for both psoriasis and eczema  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>, or acitretin for pustular psoriasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Infliximab is a rapid-acting biologic agent that can also be used in the setting of erythrodermic psoriasis .\n\n【15】Table 11.1\n\n【16】Various “cool down” methods prior to initiating phototherapy for inflammatory skin conditions\n\n| “Cool down” method | Use |\n| --- | --- |\n| Topical corticosteroids under plastic occlusion | Any topical steroid-responsive inflammatory skin conditions including erythroderma |\n| Cyclosporine | Severe psoriasis (any subtype including plaque, guttate, pustular, erythrodermic, palmoplantar), severe atopic dermatitis/eczema |\n| Acitretin | Pustular psoriasis, erythrodermic psoriasis |\n| Infliximab | Erythrodermic psoriasis, severe plaque psoriasis |\n\n【18】Table 11.2\n\n【19】An example of a conservative phototherapy protocol for patients who present with erythroderma after proper “cool down” is completed\n\n|  | Initial dose (mJ/cm 2 ) | Subsequent dose increments (mJ/cm 2 ) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| NB-UVB | 30 | 10–30 |\n| BB-UVB | 5 | 5–10 |\n| PUVA | 0.25 | 0.5 |\n\n【21】After beginning the “cool down”, the patient is ready to start phototherapy once the skin is no longer red and only pink. Phototherapy is then added gingerly and increased very cautiously, especially at the beginning . At the UCSF Phototherapy Unit, patients with erythroderma is usually started at 30 mJ/cm <sup>2 </sup> (NB-UVB) and if this is tolerated for at least several treatments, then the dose is increased by 10–30 mJ/cm <sup>2 </sup> . Ultimately, the timing and rate of subsequent dose increments are up to the phototherapy practitioner’s assessment of each individual patient’s disease state and predicted response to UV light. The patient is instructed to continue the “cool down” at home until the erythema is only mildly pink. It is important that the patient does not apply any topical corticosteroids to the skin immediately prior to a treatment session as this can alter the penetration of light into the skin.\n\n【22】For most patients who present erythrodermic but undergo “cool down”, followed by phototherapy, they are eventually able to tolerate doses of light close to that of the usual protocol.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

However， in general， if the primary ACC can be resected without too much operative-related morbidity， it makes sense to debulk the“cortisol-secreting factory\"In this way， it provides the patient with a better quality of life while giving clinicians an opportunity to initiate treatment trials for the residual metastatic ACC.\n\n【3】The patient was a 46-year-old woman who until recently had been quite healthy.

She had lost weight and her acne had improved dramatically. She felt completely back to normal. Blood pressure was controlled on monotherapy with a B-adrenergic blocker. Electrolyte levels were nor-mal. Total and bioavailable testosterone levels were normal， and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate was low-normal at 31.8 mcg/dL (normal， 18-244 mcg/dL). Her morning serum cortisol concentration was low-normal at6.3 mcg/dL， indicating that her hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis had not yet fully recovered. She was advised to continue her 10 mg morning dose of hydrocortisone. However， CT scan of chest， abdomen， and pelvis showed that the lung nodules had enlarged and that there was new adenopathy in the upper retro-peritoneum between the aorta and inferior vena cava. Chemotherapy with etoposide， doxorubicin， and cis-platin (EDP) was initiated.3 After three cycles there was partial tumor response； however， she discontin-ued treatment with EDP due to side effects.

KD infringes on coronary arteries, and KD has replaced rheumatic fever as the most common cause of acquired heart disease in children \\[Agarwal and Agarwal, Expert Rev Clin Immunol. 13通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u>: 247–58, 2017; Guo et al. Chin Med J. 123通用删除7(英):<u>(12)</u>:1533, 2010\\]. If patients have less than three clinical symptoms, they will be diagnosed with atypical Kawasaki disease (AKD). AKD usually occurs in infants less than 6 months old 删除10：<u>\\[Minich et al. Pediatrics 120:e1434–40, 2007\\]</u>. The cause of KD is not completely clear, and the diagnosis is made mainly depending on a group of clinical manifestations. For lacking specific clinical manifestations and characteristic laboratory tests, the diagnosis is often delayed due to lack of conjunctival congestion or changes in oral mucosa. Delayed diagnosis affect effective treatment. Therefore CAA is more likely to occur \\[Imagawa et al. Eur J Pediatr. 163通用删除7(英):<u>(4–5)</u>:263–4, 2004\\].\n\n【13】Because the clinical features in AKD children are less than those in KD children, the symptoms from systems outside the cardiovascular system are often the main manifestations, including symptoms from nervous system, respiratory system, hematopoietic system, digestive system, and urinary system symptoms (the main or primary symptoms). Therefore, diagnosis is easily missed \\[Imagawa et al. Eur J Pediatr. 163通用删除7(英):<u>(4–5)</u>:263–4, 2004\\]. Once bilateral conjunctival congestion occurs, KD is usually considered even without sufficient symptoms in patients. When infants have prolonged fever and acute heart failure, with other diseases excluded, they should be considered to have IKD, especially if they receive glucocorticoid therapy at onset of illness. At subacute stage, peeling skin around fingernails or nail groove should be concerned.\n\n【14】13.1 Case 46: AKD with Gallop Rhythm\n------------------------------------\n\n【15】A previous healthy 1-year-old boy had no significant past medical and family history.\n\n【16】He presented on Day 8 of illness, with an intermittent fever 8 days, along with cough. On Day 2, he was given infusion of first-generation cephalosporin for 3 days at a local hospital and fever was not regressed. On Day 4 of illness, he received infusion of dexamethasone 3 mg. Fever was only under control for nearly 2 days, and he took oral second-generation cephalosporin at home. On Day 6 of illness, he had fever again, up to 40.1 °C. He was sleepy and had loose stools two times. Examination revealed mild fever 37.8 °C, smooth breath (HR 132 bpm, RR 28 bpm). Pharynges were congested without conjunctiva congestion. Cardiac auscultation found gallop rhythm. Others were normal. Admission blood test revealed WBC 17.16 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, NE 53.8%, HGB 106 g/L, PLT 403 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L. CRP 16.6 mg/L, ESR 80 mm. MP-IgM mild positive, MP-IgG was negative. HSV (I + II)-IgM and EBV IgM were negative. NT pro-BNP 994.1 pg/mL. It was certain that he had mycoplasma pneumoniae infection, but it was not certain whether he had acute cardiac insufficiency. After blood sample drawn for culture, he was treated with 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> infusion of creatine phosphate sodium, L-carnitine; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> infusion of azithromycin 10 mg/kg/day for 3 days; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> all infusion velocity controlled under 3 mL/kg/h.\n\n【17】On Day 9, he had fever repeatedly, and had strikingly red lips. Investigation revealed WBC 8.05 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, NE 67.0%, HGB 100 g/L, PLT 381 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L. CRP 34.20 mg/L. CKMB-M, hs-cTnT, and cTnI were normal. Cervical ultrasound found cervical lymphadenectasis, about 2.1 cm × 0.7 cm on the left and 2.2 cm × 0.9 cm on the right. ECG revealed tachycardia, HR 141 bpm, I°AVB . EEG was normal . For he was suspected to have KD and had persistent fever for 9 days, he was treated with 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> IVIG 2 g/kg over 12 h, 20% mannitol 2.5 mL/kg and furosemidum 1 g/kg also infused after IVIG 1 g/kg; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> oral aspirin 30–50 mg/kg/day and dipyridamole 3–5 mg/kg/day in two divided doses. His condition rapidly evolved favorably to IVIG treatment. His fever and red lips were settled subsequently on Day 10 of illness. Cardiac gallop rhythm disappeared. On Day 12, echo showed normal results except ASD 3.2 mm. He was afebrile over 48 h, and aspirin was reduced to one dose 3–5 mg/kg/day.\n删除3：<u>Fig. 13.1\n\n【18】On Day 9 of illness, ECG showed sinus tachycardia, HR 141 bpm, I°AVB (PR interval 176 ms)\n</u>删除3：<u>Fig. 13.2\n\n【19】On Day 13 of illness, EEG was normal\n</u>\nOn Day 13, he coughed but without sputum.

At this point, his atypical KD diagnosis was established. On Day 25, both liver function and ESR settled. On Day 39, PLT was normal. Echo performed at both one and 2 months revealed normal results. ECG was not repeated. At 2 months, medications were stopped.\n\n【25】### 13.1.3 Diagnosis\n\n【26】1\\. AKD\n\n【27】2\\. Liver dysfunction\n\n【28】3\\. I°AVB\n\n【29】4\\.

He had prolonged fever over 5 days, along with 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> strikingly red lips; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> cervical lymphadenectasis; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> peeling skin around fingernails after he was discharged.\n\n【32】There is no direct correlation between galloping and KD. Galloping is a sign of heart failure. Because it occurs in infants, there are no myocarditis, no cardiomyopathy, or congenital heart disease, it is not easy to explain this galloping rhythm. However, he had fever for a long period of time which was unresponsive to antibiotics, with obviously dry and red lips and enlarged lymph nodes in the neck. Blood test showed elevated WBC, mainly neutrophils, and significantly increased erythrocyte precipitation. He had a history of glucocorticoid injection at the fourth day of the onset. So we had a reason to speculate that he had IKD. Some of the children with IKD may develop heart failure combined with galloping rhythm. Thus, we can explain all his clinical symptoms. Fortunately, the subsequent skin peeling around the nails supported our conclusion.\n\n【33】Differential diagnosis of acute heart failure should be considered.\n\n【34】### 13.1.5 Case Specific Clinical Feature\n\n【35】1.  1.\n\n【36】    Patient had persistent fever for 9 days, intermittent fever after given injection of dexamethasone. Thus, his clinical symptoms were not obviously significant, especially he had no rashes, conjunctiva, or edema in hands and feet. When he was admitted, auscultation revealed gallop rhythm, and blood test supported typical KD: CRP >30 mg/L, ESR > 40 mm/h, combined with increased NT pro-BNP, the latter one indicated either heart or brain damage. This patient’s mental state was stable, and EEG found normal signals. Thus, mild branch pneumonia could not be used to explain gallop rhythm. According to the guideline for KD management, he was only given infusion of γ-Globulin and followed up with us. However, when informed that he received infusion of dexamethasone on Day 4 of illness, we highly suspected he had AKD. In patients treated with glucocorticoid alone at early stage of KD, chance to develop coronary artery lesion is significantly higher than in patients treated with glucocorticoid and IVIG together 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. He had remitted fever for 9 days. After discussing with his parent, they accepted IVIG treatment with oral aspirin and dipyridamole. Before discharge, he was suspected to have AKD. The diagnosis was finalized once skin peeling occurred around his fingernails.\n\n【37】Hong Wang", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The deformity is maintained by a combination of contracted  删除换行 joint capsule ligaments and contracted foot and ankle ligaments. Club foot can be clas删除8：<u>￾</u>sified as either postural or fixed. Fixed or rigid club feet are either flexible (correctable  删除换行 without surgery) or resistant (correctable with surgery). Club foot is bilateral in about  删除换行 50 per cent of cases and occurs in approximately 1 in 800 births. The condition is more  删除换行 common in males with a 2:1 ratio, and there is a 10 per cent chance of a subsequent baby  删除换行 being affected if the parents already have one child affected.\n\n【11】The bones of the midfoot are affected. The navicular is displaced medially, as is the  删除换行 cuboid. Contractures of the medial plantar soft tissues are present. The talar neck is eas删除8：<u>￾</u>ily palpable in the sinus tarsi as it is uncovered laterally. Normally, this is covered by  删除换行 the navicular, and the talar body is in the mortise. The medial malleolus is difficult to  删除换行 palpate and is often in contact with the navicular. The hindfoot is supinated, but the  删除换行 foot is often in a position of pronation relative to the hindfoot. The first ray often drops  删除换行 to create a position of cavus. The calcaneus also sits in equinus with the anterior aspect  删除换行 rotated medially and the posterior aspect laterally. The heel is small and feels empty and  删除换行 soft to touch. As the treatment progresses, the calcaneal position improves and the heel  删除换行 begins to feel firm.\n\n【12】The goal of treatment is to obtain a functional plantigrade cosmetically acceptable painless  删除换行 foot. In the present case, non-operative treatment comprised the Ponseti method which  删除换行 is used to correct the cavus, the adduction, then varus, and lastly the equinus deformity \n\n【13】(CAVE). Splintage begins at 2–3 days after birth. The foot should be re-manipulated  删除换行 weekly and reassessed radiographically at 3 months. An Achilles tenotomy may be  删除换行 necessary if the hindfoot equinus persists. Surgery should be used as soon as it is obvious  删除换行 that conservative treatment is failing. Operative treatments involve soft-tissue release for  删除换行 children (6–12 months).

Orthodontic bands are placed on both sides (right and left) for accommodation of maxillo-mandibular elastics to hold the teeth correctly in occlusion at night . The elastics are removed each morning upon waking up, and the patient is allowed full daytime use of the jaw with no dietary restrictions. Chewing brings energy and loading through the mandible to the fractured condyle being remodelled to the needs of function. This situation is controlled and observed closely for a minimum period of 3 months and at 3-month intervals during the next 12 months.\n删除3：<u>Fig. 12.6\n\n【9】Orthodontic band in upper and lower first molar\n</u>删除3：<u>Fig. 12.7\n\n【10】( a ) Maxillo-mandibular elastics in place.

We control and provide immediate assistance if the occlusion begins to drift or the incisal opening begins to decrease. Jaw symmetry and occlusion are thus maintained during rehabilitation.\n\n【11】The soft tissues heal concomitantly with the condyle during jaw movement. If jaw movement is not maintained at its fuller range, the soft tissues heal (and scar) to whatever that range might be.\n\n【12】A simple technique to increase the interincisal opening and with which patient compliance is high is to use progressively stack tongue blades together and have the patient insert them between the incisal edges of the anterior teeth . A stack of 24 tongue blades placed between the teeth will produce an opening of 40 mm at the incisal edges, a minimum goal in rehabilitation. The stacked tongue blade regimen is hard to impose in this time of high technology (TheraBite), but is very effective in children.\n删除3：<u>Fig. 12.8\n\n【13】( a ) Tongue blades in place.

However, as long as there are ways to control jaw position via the occlusion or splints, non-surgical management of the problem has proven to be a predictable and reliable way to handle these fractures.\n\n【31】When analyzed by age groups, the fractures in children 10 years or younger were judged to be intracapsular; children represent a special category when younger than age 12. The condylar neck tends to be shorter, and many fractures are thus high neck with only the condyle fractured free from the mandible. Considering their healing capabilities (e.g. regeneration of a new condylar head) 删除10：<u>(Hovinga et al. 1999 )</u>, the technical difficulty of reducing and fixing a condylar head displaced medial to the coronoid notch and the amount of soft tissue dissection required, open reduction in children younger than 12 should logically be performed infrequently.\n\n【32】Children between 12 and 18 years old still benefit from their growth potential following close reduction, but have fractures similar to adults (i.e. more low necks/ramus due to the mandibular reaching adult shape). Thus open reduction with rigid fixation and immediate function is a strong option in this age range.\n\n【33】12.2 Ankylosis\n--------------\n\n【34】Although TMJ ankylosis is one of the most common pathologies affecting the facial skeleton, it is also the most overlooked and under-managed problem in children. Ankylosis leads to reduced mandibular opening, from partial reduction to complete restriction.\n\n【35】Ankylosis in growing children affects the growth and development of the jaws and occlusion.\n\n【36】It can be defined as “inability to open the mouth due to either a fibers or bony union between the head of the condyle and the glenoid fossae” 删除10：<u>(Shashikiran et al. 2005 )</u>.\n\n【37】Ankylosis is most commonly associated with trauma, local or systemic infection or systemic disease. The onset of incidence frequently believed to be before the age of 10.\n\n【38】Clinical features of TMJ ankylosis in childhood are:\n\n【39】*   Restricted mouth opening and its associated results including poor oral hygiene and rampant caries\n\n【40】*   Facial asymmetry\n\n【41】*   Mandibular macrognathia and bird face deformity\n\n【42】*   Class II malocclusion with posterior crossbite/anterior open bite\n\n【43】TMJ ankylosis occurring in childhood can impair mandibular growth and function, which may later produce severe facial asymmetry and mandibular retrusion. Early diagnosis of TMJ ankylosis is important, and early surgical intervention is an accepted mode of treatment 删除10：<u>(Chidzonga 1999 )</u>. Surgery is indicated to restore mandibular opening. Early and aggressive postoperative opening of the mandible is necessary to maintain good opening.\n\n【44】The treatment of TMJ ankylosis faces a significant challenge because of technical difficulty and a high incidence of recurrence.\n\n【45】Recurrence is a major problem that occurs after the release of TMJ ankylosis.\n\n【46】At present the surgical procedures most frequently used for treatment of ankylosis are:\n\n【47】1.  1.\n\n【48】    Gap arthroplasty, in which a joint space is recreated either at the side of the pre-existing space or below it; in this case no substance is interposed between the recreated bony surfaces.\n\n【49】2.  2.\n\n【50】    Interpositional arthroplasty, which also recreates a joint space but, in addition, an autogenous temporalis muscle flap or alloplastic material, is introduced into the gap 删除10：<u>(Brusati et al. 1990 )</u>.\n\n【51】Case 2\n\n【52】A 3-year-old child reported with the complaint of inability to open his mouth wide, deflexion of the mandible to the left and facial asymmetry .

The use of the appliance after offers comfort while haematomas are resolving and tissues are recovering. Furthermore, it provides stimulation to the muscles and favours the removal of metabolites resulting from the muscle spasms and help the mandible to keep its normal position.\n\n【73】Early stimulation and control of muscular activity is an important key in treatment; the mobilization of tissues within and around the joint frees restraints of fibrotic capsule components, and the lateral eminences increase disc mobility, reducing load concentrations. In this way we improve condylar remodelling, favour restoration of a proper function of the masticatory system and prevent mechanical restrictions originated by scarring and loss of motion.\n\n【74】In my experience, results with functional appliance therapy are more effective than those obtained with traditional physiotherapeutic exercises which are more difficult to perform for children. Such treatment is indicated not only during healing but also during the following years (at least 2) when bone regeneration and compensatory growth are to occur. In this case both the child and his parents were provided comprehensive psychological assistance before, during and after the surgical intervention.

She was initially admitted to the hospital with fever, fatigue, and a new cough for which she received antibiotics for bacterial pneumonia. While admitted to the hospital, she had sudden onset of a right-sided headache, vision changes, and confusion. Her condition deteriorated over the next several days. She developed plegia of her left arm and leg followed by the left lower face. Unfortunately, she eventually became unarousable to stimuli.\n\n【3】_Patients with very striking medical histories are at risk for both common and rare neurologic diseases. Since the context sets the stage for a wide differential diagnosis, defining the neurologic syndrome is_ _critical. Don’t be too engrossed with her past medical history for now. Let’s stick to the basics. What do you think about the pace? Is there anything peculiar_ _?_\n\n【4】On her initial neurologic exam after the sudden onset of headache and vision changes, she was found to be alert and oriented to date but not location. She was inattentive, and she could only follow simple commands. Her speech was fluent. She had a right gaze preference and a left homonymous hemianopia. Other cranial nerves were unremarkable. She had a mild left hemiparesis (arm weaker than leg). She had preserved sensation but extinction on the left to double simultaneous sensory stimulation. When asked to clap, she would bring her right hand to midline and “clap” the air; her left hand remained still on the bed. Her sensation and reflexes were normal. Her subsequent examinations over the next several days were notable for decreased arousal as well as development of left lower facial droop and complete plegia of her left arm and leg.### What is the pace?\n\n【5】This one is a bit tricky. How would you define the pace? The onset of her symptoms is “sudden,” so that fits with a hyperacute pace of disease. However, she subsequently worsens over the next several days. Should we still consider the pace to be hyperacute, or does this mean that the pace is acute? Could it be both? There are always exception to the rules. For now, let’s consider the pace to be hyperacute, but don’t forget that she progressively worsened over the next few days.### What is the localization?\n\n【6】There is no ambiguity that this is a central rather than peripheral nervous system process. She has a right-sided headache, which indicates that the lesion is likely on the right side. In addition, she has a left homonymous hemianopia, indicating dysfunction along the visual pathway somewhere behind the optic chiasm. Be careful not to immediately assume this is dysfunction of the contralateral occipital lobe, as a more anterior thalamic lesion or a large hemispheric lesion could also cause a homonymous hemianopia.\n\n【7】In addition to her visual field deficit, she has signs of left-sided neglect. She has extinction to double simultaneous stimulation and Eastchester clapping sign. When asked to clap, individuals with neglect due to a right parietal lesion will bring their right hand to midline in the air in a clapping motion, but their left hand will remain limp at their side. In contrast, when patients with left upper extremity weakness due to corticospinal tract dysfunction are asked to clap, they will bring their right hand all the way over to the weak left hand to clap the two hands together. She also is disoriented to location but not time, which is atypical (usually patients are disoriented to time before location). This finding also indicates a nondominant parietal lesion.\n\n【8】Both her left homonymous hemianopia and left-sided neglect strongly point to a lesion involving the right parietal +/− occipital lobes. Her left hemiparesis as well as gaze preference, although potentially localizable to other aspects of the brain or brainstem, could also be due to the same lesion. Let’s follow Occam’s razor and assume that the simplest explanation is the correct explanation, and all of her signs and symptoms are due to a single lesion involving the right parietal and, possibly, occipital lobes.### What is the differential diagnosis?\n\n【9】Her syndromic diagnosis _is_ a hyperacute onset of a right, nondominant parietal syndrome.### What is the differential diagnosis?\n\n【10】The etiologic diagnosis includes vascular events and seizure. Since there is no description of seizure-like activity, then a vascular event (ischemic or hemorrhagic) is most likely.### Clinical course and additional information\n\n【11】Her initial head imaging showed a hemorrhage in the right parieto-occipital lobes .\n删除3：<u>Figure 18.1 CT head shows a hemorrhage in the right parieto-occipital lobes.</u>\n\n【12】Her imaging is consistent with the hyperacute onset of her symptoms. Typically, an intracerebral hemorrhage causes symptoms within seconds to minutes of onset. So far, her imaging fits her clinical syndrome. Is this the end diagnosis? It’s a safe bet, since I included this case, that we have a bit more work to do before getting to the final diagnosis. Were there any changes to her imaging after her examination worsened? Could the pace or progression of her symptoms be a clue to the underlying cause of her hemorrhage? Let’s look at her subsequent imaging in Figure 18.2 , obtained in the setting of her clinical deterioration.\n删除3：<u>Figure 18.2 ( A ) MRI brain axial FLAIR shows increased edema, effacement of the occipital horn of the lateral ventricle, and midline shift. ( B ) MRI brain T1 post-contrast shows an irregular contrast-enhancing border.</u>\n\n【13】Her imaging worsened, corresponding to her deteriorating clinical status. It could be that her progressively worsening neurologic exam is simply a sequela of severe intracerebral hemorrhage. We do frequently see either extension of prior hemorrhage or clinical worsening due to other medical illness in the hospital, which can cause a patient’s neurologic exam to worsen after the initial injury. However, I am intentionally including this case to highlight a critical point. Let’s review the history again.\n\n【14】_Her condition deteriorated over the next several days. She developed plegia of her left arm_ _and leg followed by the left lower face. She eventually became unarousable to stimuli_ _._\n\n【15】That is a severe and quick neurologic decline. What is the pace of her decline? She is worsening over hours to days. This fits within an acute pace of disease, as discussed earlier. How do we reconcile this with her initial hyperacute onset of symptoms? What if the same underlying etiology is presenting with two simultaneous syndromes—both a hyperacute onset and then acute progressive worsening? We already discussed, and then saw on her imaging, that her hyperacute onset was consistent with a vascular event, in this case an intracerebral hemorrhage. What are the possible etiologies of an acute onset of a cerebral syndrome with worsening clinical and radiographic progression? Since we have a large lesion on our imaging, we can safely exclude toxic or metabolic conditions. We are left with inflammatory or infectious conditions.### What is the context?\n\n【16】Our patient is a 66-year-old immunosuppressed woman with a history of stem cell transplant who initially presented with a cough and fever. In this context, infection seems like a more likely etiology of acute neurologic syndrome due to a rapidly enlarging mass lesion than an inflammatory disorder. At this point, it would be just guessing to name a pathogen without obtaining a biopsy.### Conclusion\n\n【17】Due to the rapid nature of her decline, she underwent biopsy of one of the masses seen in her lungs  as well as her brain.\n删除3：<u>Figure 18.3 CT chest shows mass-like opacities in the apex of the left lung as well as scattered nodular opacities suggestive of fungal multifocal pneumonia.</u>\n\n【18】Her biopsies showed invasive mucormycosis in the lung and brain. Mucormycosis is a fungus found in the environment that causes rare, but often fatal, infections in immunocompromised individuals. Infected hosts breathe spores from the environment that germinate into hyphae in the alveoli. Mucormycosis is angioinvasive and has a strong tropism for blood vessels. Her intracerebral hemorrhage was due to hematogenous seeding of mucormycosis from the lungs to the brain. This caused a CNS infection and secondary intracerebral hemorrhage. Unfortunately, the infection was ultimately fatal.\n\n【19】This case highlights the limitations, but also the power, of _pace_ . On the one hand, her initial pace of onset was hyperacute. At first glance, we would not have expected that to have been caused by an invasive fungal infection of the brain. However, her initial syndrome was caused by a hemorrhage, so in that sense the case did follow the rules established in the introductory chapter. She subsequently worsened over an acute time scale, which correspondingly was caused by a CNS infection. That again follows the rules. The methods of following _pace_ and _localization_ are frequently limited by the fact that the primary _pathologic diagnosis_ might present with multiple different _paces_ depending on its secondary effects. In some cases, that can be a hindrance to making the correct diagnosis. However, in some instances, such as this case, focusing on the multiple distinct _paces_ of disease can actually lead to the pathologic diagnosis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Common causes of postpartum haemorrhage\n\n【16】• Retained placental tissue\n\n【17】• Vaginal trauma\n\n【18】• Endometrial infection\n\n【19】• Coagulopathy (e.g. following placental abruption)\n\n【20】• Uterine atony\n\n【21】Immediate management\n\n【22】This woman is in hypovolaemic shock and needs immediate resuscitation. Two wide-bore  删除换行 cannulae should be inserted and blood sent for full blood count, urea and electrolytes,  删除换行 clotting and crossmatch of 4 units, with further red cells, platelets or fresh-frozen plasma  删除换行 requested depending on further evaluation and blood results. Immediate intravenous fluid  删除换行 should be administered, usually colloid as volume expansion to maintain cardiac output.\n\n【23】The uterus should be rubbed suprapubically, and if this fails then bimanually, pending  删除换行 administration of 500 mg ergometrine and commencing a syntocinon infusion. These mea删除8：<u>￾</u>sures stem the blood loss and aid immediate resuscitation while the diagnosis is investigated. \n\n【24】A urinary catheter should be inserted to allow close fluid balance monitoring and renal func删除8：<u>￾</u>tion. The anaesthetist and senior obstetrician should be called urgently.\n\n【25】Subsequent management\n\n【26】The fact that the cervix is open is pathognomonic of retained tissue, and evacuation of  删除换行 retained products of conception should be arranged once the woman has been resuscitated  删除换行 and blood is available.\n\n【27】In view of the haemodynamic instability, general anaesthetic is preferred. Intravenous antibi删除8：<u>￾</u>otics should be given. The woman should be monitored initially in a high-dependency setting  删除换行 until clinically and haematologically stable.\n\n【28】Although she is likely to have had a coagulopathy at admission, she is still at high risk of venous  删除换行 thromboembolism as she is probably septic, postpartum and has undergone anaesthetic. \n\n【29】Thromboembolic stockings and heparin should therefore be administered postoperatively.\n\n【30】Ultrasound scan\n\n【31】Ultrasound scan would not be indicated in this scenario. First, an open cervix implies  删除换行 retained products and it would therefore be superfluous. Second, an examination under  删除换行 anaesthetic is warranted anyway to establish any other cause of bleeding, such as vaginal  删除换行 or perineal trauma.

PNPs often work on multidisciplinary teams. Individual state legislators establish PNP practice authority. However, even in full practice authority states, PNPs often collaborate with physician partners. If both a PNP and a collaborating physician see a patient (face‐to‐face encounter) and contribute to the evaluation and management, then the encounter can be _split or shared_ . Shared E/M encounters can be reimbursed at 100% of the physician fee schedule if both the PNP and the physician see the patient on the same calendar date. The PNP and physician may see the patient jointly or independently, both providers must document, and documentation should be linked in some fashion. Finally, documentation must support the level of service 删除10：<u>(Munro, 2013 )</u>.\n\n【3】Another type of collaborative encounter is the _incident to_ service. “Incident to” encounters can also be reimbursed at 100% of the physician fee schedule. However, “incident to” encounters are exclusive to the ambulatory setting and the following criteria must be met.\n\n【4】*   PNP sees the patient under the physician’s direct supervision.\n*   The physician must be immediately available.\n*   The physician must perform the initial visit or consultation.\n*   The physician is not required to see the patient at every visit.\n*   The physician must contribute to the plan of care.\n\n【5】### Is critical care management different from E/M documentation and billing?\n\n【6】Critical care management is the highest level of E/M. The rules regarding the seven key elements of E/M do not apply to critical care management documentation. Critical care management documentation requires evidence of “a critical illness or injury acutely impairing one or more vital organ systems such that there is a high probability of imminent or life threatening deterioration in the patient’s condition” (Britton _et al_ . 2019 , pp. 15–46). Further, as per CPT, critical care “involves high complexity decision making to assess, manipulate, and support vital system function(s) to treat single or multiple vital organ system failure and/or to prevent further life threatening deterioration of the patient’s condition” (Britton _et al_ . 2019 , pp. 15–46).\n\n【7】The overriding principle in documenting critical care E/M is to demonstrate, with data and a narrative of interval events, a description of organ system(s) impairments; the rationale of interventions to assess, manipulate, and support vital organ function; and the patient’s response to treatment. A review of systems and most histories, unless pertinent, are not required.\n\n【8】### Are critical care management codes different for pediatric patients?\n\n【9】Critical care codes for neonate and pediatric patients (29 days to 5 years) are per diem. Once a patient reaches his or her sixth birthday, time‐based codes are reported. Pediatric critical care codes are exclusive to the inpatient setting. If critical care is initiated in a clinic or emergency department, time‐based critical care codes are used.\n\n【10】While only one pediatric critical care code can be reported per patient per calendar day, it is not uncommon for multiple providers to provide critical care to a single patient in a calendar day. For example, a pediatric patient with septic shock and seizures might be seen by both a pediatric intensivist and a neurologist on the same day. The intensivist is managing vasoactive medications, resuscitation, antibiotics, and ventilator settings while the neurologist is interpreting the electroencephalogram and providing recommendations related to anti‐seizure medications. One physician, likely the intensivist, will report the pediatric critical care code and the neurologist will report a time‐based critical care code.\n\n【11】### A critically ill 5-year-old is transferred to a larger hospital for more advanced services. What critical care code does the receiving PNP report and what code should the transferring PNP report?\n\n【12】Pediatric critical codes include initial inpatient encounter codes and subsequent day codes. Only one initial inpatient critical care encounter code can be reported per patient per hospital stay. Every additional critical care code reported during of the hospital stay should be a subsequent day critical care code. If a patient were to leave the intensive care unit (ICU) and later decompensate and return to the ICU, a subsequent day code would again be reported.\n\n【13】The child’s age also determines the critical care code reported . Critical care provided to children aged 29 days to 24 months utilizes CPT code 99471 (initial inpatient encounter) and 99472 (subsequent days) 删除10：<u>(Lesnick, 2010 )</u>. CPT code 99475 is reported for initial inpatient critical care encounter for children aged 2 through 5 years and CPT code 99476 is reported for subsequent day critical care 删除10：<u>(Lesnick, 2010 )</u>.\n\n【14】When neonates or children under 6 years of age are transferred from one hospital to another, the receiving provider should report an initial per diem critical care code (99471 or 99475) and the transferring provider should report time‐based codes for the day of transfer.\n\n【15】### Do time‐based critical care management codes have different documentation requirements than pediatric critical care management codes?\n\n【16】Time‐based codes are reported for pediatric and adult critical care services depending on the circumstance . If a patient is aged 29 days to 5 years, per diem codes are used first. Conversely, if additional critical care is rendered by a second provider from a different group or specialty, time‐based codes are then reported. If the patient is 6 years or older, time‐based codes are always reported. CPT code 99291 represents the first 30–74 minutes of critical care provided by a single provider. CPT code 99292 may be reported for each additional 30 minutes (beyond 74 minutes) of critical care provider by an initial provider or a member of the provider’s group. The time reported may be continuous or aggregate, but the total number of minutes must reflect a single calendar day. However, if a clinician provides continuous critical care that was initiated before midnight and extends into the next calendar date, the time is attributed to the date the services were initiated. Some insurers may require a start and stop time (e.g. 9:15 a.m. to 10:10 a.m.) while others accept a cumulative total of minutes per day.\n\n【17】Table 10.3 Pediatric critical care codes.\n\n【18】_Source:_ Lesnick 通用删除7(英):<u>( 2010 )</u>.

Two providers from a single group cannot report critical care for the same time period. Thus, it is important to document start and stop times when multiple providers are delivering critical care. Finally, time‐based critical care codes must be rendered in exclusive attention to a single patient 删除10：<u>(Painter, 2013 )</u>. The provider may not assess, deliver care, or consult on other patients during the minutes time‐based critical care codes are reported.\n\n【24】### Which services are bundled into pediatric critical care codes?\n\n【25】Many procedures and services are bundled into pediatric and time‐based codes . Bundled services are assumed to be included in routine critical care and cannot be billed separately.\n\n【26】### What elements need to be documented for pediatric critical care billing?\n\n【27】Documentation for critical care services should include patient information, including name, MRN, and date of birth; a history of present critical event; summary of interval events, including description of unstable or failing organ system(s), medical necessity, and response to treatment; corresponding diagnoses; summary of communication with patient, family, surrogates and other providers; time in minutes (if reporting a time‐based code); and a provider attestation (if reporting time‐based codes) 删除10：<u>(Pohlig, 2013 )</u>.\n\n【28】The critical care attestation is a statement necessary for time‐based codes. It is a declaration attesting that the reporting provider was in exclusive attention to the critically ill patient, physically present on the unit, and the time reported is exclusive of unbundled procedures and services. The EMR provides clinicians with an opportunity to develop templates to ensure the documentation includes necessary billing elements and the appropriate verbiage for the attestation.\n\n【29】### What services do not merit critical care management codes?\n\n【30】It is important to note that admission to an ICU does not necessarily merit critical care management codes. Examples of situations that will _not_ satisfy medical necessity criteria for critical care are listed here.\n\n【31】*   The patient is admitted to the ICU for 24 hours of ventilator management before a planned extubation the following day. Routine postoperative ventilator management does not meet the standard for critical care.\n*   The patient is admitted to the ICU for administration of a thrombolytic for treatment of a pulmonary embolism. The patient is otherwise stable. Admissions due to institution rules requiring ICU admission for particular treatments do not meet the standard for critical care.\n*   The patient is admitted to the ICU because no other hospital beds are available.PICU Case Study\n---------------\n\n【32】A 7‐year‐old African American male was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with a diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia at 7 p.m. The patient was on supplemental oxygen via high‐flow nasal cannula 20 L/min and _F_ i O <sub>2 </sub> 40%. At 8:15 p.m. the patient experienced increased work of breathing and oxygen desaturation to 80%. _P_ a O <sub>2 </sub> on arterial blood gas analysis is 67 mmHg. A decision is made to intubate the patient, which is accomplished by the PNP. The patient becomes hypotensive requiring fluid resuscitation and the insertion of a non‐tunneled central venous catheter. A nasogastric tube is also inserted. A bronchoscopy is performed at the bedside by a pulmonologist. Thick purulent secretions are observed in addition to a mucous plug in the right middle lobe, which is successfully removed via suction. A bronchoalveolar lavage sample is sent for culture. The endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are verified by portable chest and abdominal X‐ray respectively.\n\n【33】Table 10.5 Bundled services.\n\n【34】_Source:_ Data from Grider 通用删除7(英):<u>( 2019 )</u>.\n\n|  | Services bundled into per diem pediatric critical care codes | Services bundled into time‐based critical care codes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Peripheral vessel catheterization | √ |  |\n| Introduction of needle or intracatheter, upper or lower extremity artery | √ |  |\n| Arterial catheterization for sampling, monitoring, or transfusion | √ |  |\n| Umbilical venous catheterization | √ |  |\n| Central vessel catheterization | √ |  |\n| Vascular access procedures | √ |  |\n| Vascular puncture | √ |  |\n| Umbilical arterial catheterization | √ |  |\n| Endotracheal intubation | √ |  |\n| Ventilation management | √ | √ |\n| Bedside pulmonary function test | √ | √ |\n| Surfactant administration | √ |  |\n| Continuous positive airway pressure | √ | √ |\n| Monitoring or interpretation of blood gases or oxygen saturation | √ | √ |\n| Car seat evaluation | √ |  |\n| Transfusion of blood components | √ | √ |\n| Oral or nasogastric tube placement | √ | √ |\n| Suprapubic bladder aspiration | √ | √ |\n| Bladder catheterization | √ | √ |\n| Lumbar puncture | √ |  |\n| Interpretation of cardiac output measures | √ | √ |\n| Chest radiography | √ | √ |\n| Collection and interpretation of physiologic data | √ | √ |\n| Temporary transcutaneous pacing | √ | √ |\n| Vascular access procedures | √ |  |Questions\n---------\n\n【36】Answer the following questions using the details provided.\n\n【37】1.

The US Office of Inspector General enforces regulations related to medical billing and reimbursement in the United States. The regulations are in place to prevent fraud by healthcare providers and billers. It is therefore important that documentation is accurate and reflects the services the provider rendered and a patient’s factual state of health. There should never be an effort to “up‐code” if the facts and documentation do not support the higher level of billing. While details and accuracy help facilitate optimal billing potential, it is incumbent upon the PNP to always accurately document.\n\n【56】The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) was established in 1996. The rules and regulations put forth in the HIPAA legislation guarantees rights to patients with regard to their healthcare and medical record. It also safeguards patient confidentiality and a secure medical record, whether it is paper or electronic.\n\n【57】Every healthcare organization should have a compliance office. Compliance officers provide clinicians with education, advice and support related to rules and regulations. In addition, billing entities often provide education and resources to providers regarding documentation and required billing elements. PNPs should familiarize themselves with resources and know appropriate contacts within an organization that can provide guidance and support related to documentation and compliance.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Approach to the Patient\n\n【4】Applying “book learning” to a specific clinical situation is one the most challenging tasks in medicine. To do so, the clinician must not only retain information, organize facts, and recall large amounts of data but also apply all of this to the patient. The purpose of this text is to facilitate this process.\n\n【5】The first step involves gathering information, also known as establishing the database. This includes taking the history, performing the physical examination, and obtaining selective laboratory examinations, special studies, and/or imaging tests. Sensitivity and respect should always be exercised during the interview of patients. A good clinician also knows how to ask the same question in several different ways, using different terminology. For example, patients may deny having “congestive heart failure” but will answer affirmatively to being treated for “fluid on the lungs.”\n\n【6】CLINICAL PEARL\n\n【7】 The history is usually the single most important tool in obtaining a diagnosis. The art of seeking this information in a nonjudgmental, sensitive, and thorough manner cannot be overemphasized.\n\n【8】### HISTORY\n\n【9】1\\. Basic information:\n\n【10】a. Age: Some conditions are more common at certain ages; for instance, chest pain in an elderly patient is more worrisome for coronary artery disease than the same complaint in a teenager.\n\n【11】b. Gender: Some disorders are more common in men, such as abdominal aortic aneurysms. In contrast, women more commonly have autoimmune problems, such as chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura or systemic lupus erythematosus. Also, the possibility of pregnancy must be considered in any woman of child-bearing age.\n\n【12】c. Ethnicity: Some disease processes are more common in certain ethnic groups (such as type 2 diabetes mellitus in the Hispanic population).\n\n【13】CLINICAL PEARL\n\n【14】 Family Medicine illustrates the importance of longitudinal care; that is, seeing the patient in various phases and stages of life.\n\n【15】2\\. Chief complaint: What is it that brought the patient into the hospital? Has there been a change in a chronic or recurring condition or is this a completely new problem? The duration and character of the complaint, associated symptoms, and exacerbating/relieving factors should be recorded. The chief complaint engenders a differential diagnosis, and the possible etiologies should be explored by further inquiry.\n\n【16】CLINICAL PEARL\n\n【17】 The first line of any presentation should include _Age, Ethnicity, Gender, Marital Status, and Chief Complaint_ . Example: A 32-year-old married white male complains of lower abdominal pain of 8-hour duration.\n\n【18】3\\. Past medical history:\n\n【19】a. Major illnesses such as hypertension, diabetes, reactive airway disease, congestive heart failure, angina, or stroke should be detailed.\n\n【20】i.   Age of onset, severity, end-organ involvement.\n\n【21】ii.  Medications taken for the particular illness, including any recent changes to medications and reason for the change(s).\n\n【22】iii. Last evaluation of the condition (eg, When was the last stress test or cardiac catheterization performed in the patient with angina?)\n\n【23】iv. Which physician or clinic is following the patient for the disorder?\n\n【24】b. Minor illnesses such as recent upper respiratory infections.\n\n【25】c. Hospitalizations, no matter how trivial, should be queried.\n\n【26】4\\. Past surgical history: Date and type of procedure performed, indication, and outcome. Laparoscopy versus laparotomy should be distinguished. Surgeon and hospital name/location should be listed. This information should be correlated with the surgical scars on the patient’s body. Any complications should be delineated including anesthetic complications, difficult intubations, and so on.\n\n【27】5\\. Allergies: Reactions to medications should be recorded, including severity and temporal relationship to medication. Immediate hypersensitivity should be distinguished from an adverse reaction.\n\n【28】6\\. Medications: A list of medications, dosage, route of administration and frequency, and duration of use should be developed. Prescription, over-the-counter, and herbal remedies are all relevant. If the patient is currently taking antibiotics, it is important to note what type of infection is being treated.\n\n【29】7\\. Immunization history: Vaccination and prevention of disease is a principal goal of the family physician; hence, recording the immunizations received including dates, age, route, and adverse reactions, if any, is critical.\n\n【30】8\\. Screening history: Cost-effective surveillance for common diseases or malignancy is another cornerstone responsibility of the family physician. An organized record-keeping is important to a time-efficient approach to this area.\n\n【31】9\\. Social history: Occupation, marital status, family support, and tendencies toward depression or anxiety are important. Use or abuse of illicit drugs, tobacco, or alcohol should also be recorded. Social history, including marital stressors, sexual dysfunction, and sexual preference, are of importance.\n\n【32】10\\. Family history: Many major medical problems are genetically transmitted (eg, hemophilia, sickle cell disease). In addition, a family history of conditions such as breast cancer and ischemic heart disease can be a risk factor for the development of these diseases.\n\n【33】11\\. Review of systems: A systematic review should be performed but focused on the life-threatening and the more common diseases. For example, in a young man with a testicular mass, trauma to the area, weight loss, and infectious symptoms are important to note. In an elderly woman with generalized weakness, symptoms suggestive of cardiac disease should be elicited, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, or palpitations.\n\n【34】### PHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n\n【35】1\\. General appearance: Mental status, alert versus obtunded, anxious, in pain, in distress, interaction with other family members, and with examiner.\n\n【36】2\\. Vital signs: Record the temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate. An oxygen saturation is useful in patients with respiratory symptoms. Height and weight are often placed here with a body mass index calculated (weight in kg/height in m squared = kg/m <sup>2 </sup> ).\n\n【37】3\\. Head and neck examination: Evidence of trauma, tumors, facial edema, goiter and thyroid nodules, and carotid bruits should be sought. In patients with altered mental status or a head injury, pupillary size, symmetry, and reactivity are important. Mucous membranes should be inspected for pallor, jaundice, and evidence of dehydration. Cervical and supraclavicular nodes should be palpated.\n\n【38】4\\. Breast examination: Inspection for symmetry and skin or nipple retraction, as well as palpation for masses. The nipple should be assessed for discharge, and the axillary and supraclavicular regions should be examined.\n\n【39】5\\. Cardiac examination: The point of maximal impulse (PMI) should be ascertained, and the heart auscultated at the apex and base. It is important to note whether the auscultated rhythm is regular or irregular. Heart sounds (including S <sub>3 </sub> and S <sub>4 </sub> ), murmurs, clicks, and rubs should be characterized. Systolic flow murmurs are fairly common as a result of the increased cardiac output, but significant diastolic murmurs are unusual.\n\n【40】6\\. Pulmonary examination: The lung fields should be examined systematically and thoroughly. Stridor, wheezes, rales, and rhonchi should be recorded. The clinician should also search for evidence of consolidation (bronchial breath sounds, egophony) and increased work of breathing (retractions, abdominal breathing, accessory muscle use).\n\n【41】7\\. Abdominal examination: The abdomen should be inspected for scars, distension, masses, and discoloration. For instance, the Grey-Turner sign of bruising at the flank areas may indicate intra-abdominal or retroperitoneal hemorrhage. Auscultation should identify normal versus high-pitched and hyperactive versus hypoactive bowel sounds. The abdomen should be percussed for the presence of shifting dullness (indicating ascites). Then careful palpation should begin away from the area of pain and progress to include the whole abdomen to assess for tenderness, masses, organomegaly (ie, spleen or liver), and peritoneal signs. Guarding and whether it is voluntary or involuntary should be noted.\n\n【42】8\\. Back and spine examination: The back should be assessed for symmetry, tenderness, and masses. The flank regions particularly are important to assess for pain on percussion that may indicate renal disease.\n\n【43】9\\. Genital examination:\n\n【44】a. Female: The external genitalia should be inspected, then the speculum used to visualize the cervix and vagina. A bimanual examination should attempt to elicit cervical motion tenderness, uterine size, and ovarian masses or tenderness.\n\n【45】b. Male: The penis should be examined for hypospadias, lesions, and discharge. The scrotum should be palpated for tenderness and masses. If a mass is present, it can be transilluminated to distinguish between solid and cystic masses. The groin region should be carefully palpated for bulging (hernias) upon rest and provocation (coughing, standing).\n\n【46】c. Rectal examination: A rectal examination will reveal masses in the posterior pelvis and may identify gross or occult blood in the stool. In females, nodularity and tenderness in the uterosacral ligament may be signs of endometriosis. The posterior uterus and palpable masses in the cul-de-sac may be identified by rectal examination. In the male, the prostate gland should be palpated for tenderness, nodularity, and enlargement.\n\n【47】10\\. Extremities and skin: The presence of joint effusions, tenderness, rashes, edema, and cyanosis should be recorded. It is also important to note capillary refill and peripheral pulses.\n\n【48】11\\. Neurologic examination: Patients who present with neurologic complaints require a thorough assessment including mental status, cranial nerves, strength, sensation, reflexes, and cerebellar function.\n\n【49】CLINICAL PEARL\n\n【50】 A thorough understanding of functional anatomy is important to optimally interpret the physical examination findings.\n\n【51】12\\. Laboratory assessment depends on the circumstances\n\n【52】a. CBC, or complete blood count, can assess for anemia, leukocytosis (infection), and thrombocytopenia.\n\n【53】b. Basic metabolic panel: electrolytes, glucose, BUN (blood urea nitrogen), and creatinine (renal function).\n\n【54】c. Urinalysis and/or urine culture to assess for hematuria, pyuria, or bacteruria. A pregnancy test is important in women of child-bearing age.\n\n【55】d. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase for liver function; amylase and lipase to evaluate the pancreas.\n\n【56】e. Cardiac markers (creatine kinase myocardial band \\[CK-MB\\], troponin, myoglobin) if coronary artery disease or other cardiac dysfunction is suspected.\n\n【57】f. Drug levels such as acetaminophen level in possible overdoses .\n\n【58】g. Arterial blood gas measurements give information about oxygenation, carbon dioxide, and pH readings.\n\n【59】13\\. Diagnostic adjuncts\n\n【60】a. Electrocardiogram if cardiac ischemia, dysrhythmia, or other cardiac dysfunction is suspected.\n\n【61】b. Ultrasound examination is useful in evaluating pelvic processes in female patients (eg, pelvic inflammatory disease, tuboovarian abscess) and in diagnosing gall stones and other gallbladder disease. With the addition of color-flow Doppler, deep venous thrombosis and ovarian or testicular torsion can be detected.\n\n【62】c. Computed tomography (CT) is useful in assessing the brain for masses, bleeding, strokes, and skull fractures. CTs of the chest can evaluate for masses, fluid collections, aortic dissections, and pulmonary emboli. Abdominal CTs can detect infection (abscess, appendicitis, diverticulitis), masses, aortic aneurysms, and ureteral stones.\n\n【63】d. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) helps to identify soft tissue planes very well. In the emergency department setting, this is most commonly used to rule out spinal cord compression, cauda equina syndrome, and epidural abscess or hematoma.\n\n【64】e. Screening tests: Fasting lipid panel can demonstrate the cholesterol level, including the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, which have prognostic significance in coronary heart disease; fasting glucose and thyroid tests may be important; in many centers, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) is the test of choice to monitor bone mineral density; the mammogram is the examination of choice to assess for subclinical breast cancer; the double-contrast barium enema and colonoscopy are used to detect colonic polyps or malignancy.### Part 2. Approach to Clinical Problem Solving\n\n【65】### CLASSIC CLINICAL PROBLEM SOLVING\n\n【66】There are typically four distinct steps that the family physician undertakes to systematically solve most clinical problems:\n\n【67】1\\. Making the diagnosis\n\n【68】2\\. Assessing the severity of the disease\n\n【69】3\\. Treating based on the stage of the disease\n\n【70】4\\. Following the patient’s response to the treatment\n\n【71】### MAKING THE DIAGNOSIS\n\n【72】This is achieved by carefully evaluating the patient, analyzing the information, assessing risk factors, and developing a list of possible diagnoses (the differential). Usually a long list of possible diagnoses can be pared down to a few of the most likely or most serious ones, based on the clinician’s knowledge, experience, and selective testing. For example, a patient who complains of upper abdominal pain and has a history of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use may have peptic ulcer disease; another patient who has abdominal pain, fatty food intolerance, and abdominal bloating may have cholelithiasis. Yet another individual with a 1-day history of periumbilical pain that now localizes to the right lower quadrant may have acute appendicitis.\n\n【73】CLINICAL PEARL\n\n【74】 The first step in clinical problem solving is making the diagnosis.\n\n【75】### ASSESSING THE SEVERITY OF THE DISEASE\n\n【76】After establishing the diagnosis, the next step is to characterize the severity of the disease process; in other words, to describe “how bad” the disease is. This may be as simple as determining whether a patient is “sick” or “not sick.” Is the patient with a urinary tract infection septic or stable for outpatient therapy? In other cases, a more formal staging may be used. For example, cancer staging is used for the strict assessment of extent of malignancy.\n\n【77】CLINICAL PEARL\n\n【78】 The second step in clinical problem solving is to establish the severity or stage of disease. This usually impacts the treatment and/or prognosis.\n\n【79】### TREATING BASED ON STAGE\n\n【80】Many illnesses are characterized by stage or severity because this affects prognosis and treatment. As an example, a formerly healthy young man with pneumonia and no respiratory distress may be treated with oral antibiotics at home. An older person with emphysema and pneumonia would probably be admitted to the hospital for IV antibiotics. A patient with pneumonia and respiratory failure would likely be intubated and admitted to the intensive care unit for further treatment.\n\n【81】CLINICAL PEARL\n\n【82】 The third step in clinical problem solving is tailoring the treatment to fit the severity or “stage” of the disease.\n\n【83】### FOLLOWING THE RESPONSE TO TREATMENT\n\n【84】The final step in the approach to disease is to follow the patient’s response to the therapy. Some responses are clinical, such as improvement (or lack of improvement) in a patient’s pain. Other responses may be followed by testing (eg, monitoring the anion gap in a patient with diabetic ketoacidosis). The clinician must be prepared to know what to do if the patient does not respond as expected. Is the next step to treat again, to reassess the diagnosis, or to follow up with another more specific test?\n\n【85】CLINICAL PEARL\n\n【86】 The fourth step in clinical problem solving is to monitor treatment response or efficacy. This may be measured in different ways—symptomatically or based on physical examination or other testing. For the emergency physician, the vital signs, oxygenation, urine output, and mental status are the key parameters.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Here we present a case of a patient with CAH who had huge myelolipoma.\n\n【3】**Case Report**\n\n【4】The patient was a 52-year-old man with history of21-hydroxylase deficiency diagnosed at 2 months of age during workup for failure to thrive. He had a sporadic follow-upfor known CAH. Several months before current presentation， he was inci-dentally found to have a large adrenal mass that was visualized on a computed tomography (CT) scan performed for evaluation of coronary cal-cium. Adrenal mass biopsy was performed under the direction of his local health care providers and demonstrated possible myelolipoma versus liposar-coma. Open adrenalectomy was scheduled， but the patient chose to pursue a second opinion on treat-ment and presented to our institution.\n\n【5】His review of systems was negative for signs of Cushing syndrome. He described occasional epi-sodes of lightheadedness. He also reported abdomi-nal discomfort and abnormalities in gastrointestinal transit. In addition to CAH， his medical history Waspositive for hypertension. His medications included hydrocortisone (15 mg on waking and 5mg in the afternoon) and telmisartan. He was not taking fludrocortisone. On physical examination， 删除换行 his body mass index was 45.9 kg/m2， blood pressure126/74 mmHg，and heart rate 79 beats per minute.

The pain is associated with nausea and vomiting, and any attempt to eat since has caused increased pain. Which of the following is the most likely cause?\n\n【1】A. Gastric ulcer\n\n【2】B. Cholelithiasis\n\n【3】C. Duodenal ulcer\n\n【4】D. Acute hepatitis\n\n【5】**Answer**: 4.1 B. Right-upper abdominal pain of acute onset that occurs after ingestion of a fatty meal and is associated with nausea and vomiting is most suggestive of biliary colic as a result of gallstones. Duodenal ulcer pain is likely to be diminished with food, and gastric ulcer pain is not likely to have acute severe onset. Acute hepatitis is more likely to produce dull ache and tenderness.\n\n【6】**Question**: 4.2 Which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding _H pylori_ infection?\n\n【7】A. It is more common in developed than underdeveloped countries.\n\n【8】B. It is associated with the development of colon cancer.\n\n【9】C. It is believed to be the cause of nonulcer dyspepsia.\n\n【10】D. The route of transmission is believed to be sexually transmitted.\n\n【11】E. It is believed to be a common cause of both duodenal and gastric ulcers.\n\n【12】**Answer**: 4.2 E. Although _Hpylori_ is clearly linked to gastric and duodenal ulcers and probably to gastric carcinoma and lymphoma, whether it is more common in patients with nonulcer dyspepsia and whether treatment in those patients reduces symptoms are unclear. It is more common in underdeveloped or developing countries.\n\n【13】**Question**: 4.3 A 45-year-old man was brought to the ER after vomiting bright red blood. He has a blood pressure of 88/46 mm Hg and heart rate of 120 bpm. Which of the following is the best next step?\n\n【14】A. Intravenous fluid resuscitation and preparation for a transfusion\n\n【15】B. Administration of a proton-pump inhibitor\n\n【16】C. Guaiac test of the stool\n\n【17】D. Treatment for _H pylori_\n\n【18】**Answer**: 4.3 A. This patient is hemodynamically unstable with hypotension and tachycardia as a consequence of the acute blood loss. Volume resuscitation, immediately with crystalloid or colloid solution, followed by blood transfusion, if necessary, is the initial step to prevent irreversible shock and death. Later, after stabilization, acid suppression and _H pylori_ treatment might be useful to heal an ulcer, if one is present.\n\n【19】**Question**: 4.4 Which one of the following patients should be promptly referred for endoscopy?\n\n【20】A. A 65-year-old man with new onset of epigastric pain and weight loss\n\n【21】B. A 32-year-old patient whose symptoms are not relieved with ranitidine\n\n【22】C. A 29-year-old _H pylori-positive_ patient with dyspeptic symptoms\n\n【23】D. A 49-year-old woman with intermittent right-upper quadrant pain following meals\n**Answer**: 4.4 A. Patient in answer A has “red flag” symptoms: he is older than 45 years and has new-onset symptoms. Patient in answer B may benefit from the reassurance of a negative endoscopic examination. Patient in answer C, however, may benefit from treatment of _H pylori_ first. Some studies indicate this approach may be cost-saving overall. This patient could be sent for an endoscopic examination if she does not improve following the therapy.\n\n【24】CLINICAL PEARLS\n\n【25】 The most common causes of duodenal and gastric ulcers are _Helicobacter pylori_ infection and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.\n\n【26】 _Helicobacter pylori_ is associated with duodenal and gastric ulcers, chronic active gastritis, gastric adenocarcinoma, and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma.\n\n【27】 Treatment of peptic ulcers requires acid suppression with an H <sub>2 </sub> blocker or proton-pump inhibitor to heal the ulcer, as well as antibiotic therapy of _Helicobacter pylori_ infection, if present, to prevent recurrence.\n\n【28】 Patients with dyspepsia who have “red flag” symptoms (new dyspepsia after the age of 45 years, weight loss, dysphagia, evidence of bleeding or anemia) should be referred for an early endoscopic examination.\n\n【29】 Other patients (patients with dyspepsia who do not have “red flag” symptoms) may be tested for _Helicobacter pylori_ and treated first. Antibody tests show evidence of infection but remain positive for life, even after successful treatment. Urea breath tests are evidence of current infection.\n\n【30】 Common treatment regimens for _Helicobacter pylori_ infection include a 14-day course of a proton-pump inhibitor in high doses along with antibiotic therapy, which may include clarithromycin, amoxicillin, metronidazole, or tetracycline, along with a bismuth compound.\n\n【31】#", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Disadvantages include postoperative tracheal obstruction， recurrent laryngeal nerve injury， hypoparathyroidism， hypothyroidism and goitre recurrence.\n\n【45】Thyroxine therapy to shrink goiters is no longer recommended. Disad-vantages are that it causes only a small decrease in thyroid volume； long-term efficacy is not known； it causes a decrease in bone mineral density in postmenopausal women； and there are possible cardiac side effects.\n\n【46】●Radioiodine is an alternative to surgery in elderly patients and in those with cardiopulmonary disease. It results in a substantial decrease in thyroid volume and improvement of compressive symp-toms in most patients. Disadvantages are that it only causes a gradual decrease in thyroid volume； radiation thyroiditis (usually mild)and radiation-induced thyroid dysfunction (hyperthyroidism in 5%， hypothyroidism in 20-30%)) can occur； and there is a possi-ble risk of radiation-inducedCcancer(N Engl J Med1998；338：1438-47).\n\n【47】Treatment options depends on the nodule：\n\n【48】·Functioning benign nodule： iodine-131 is generally the therapy of choice independent of concomitant hyperthyroidism\n\n【49】·Non-functioning cystic nodules： aspiration and ethanol injection therapy may be considered， and ethanol injection or laser therapy if the nodules are solid； patients are followed annually with neck palpa-tion and measurement of the serum TSH， with repeated ultrasonog-raphy and fine-needle aspiration if there is evidence of growth of the nodule.\n\n【50】**What are the treatment options available for toxic multinodular goitre?**\n\n【51】Treatment is always indicated when overt hyperthyroidism is present. In subclinical hyperthyroidism， treatment is advisable in elderly patients and in younger ones who are at risk for cardiac disease or osteoporosis. There are three treatment options：\n\n【52】●Antithyroid drugs are valuable as pretreatment for surgery and before and after radioiodine treatment in elderly patients and those with con-current health problems. Long-term treatment is recommended only when other therapies cannot be used. The disadvantages are that the treatment is lifelong and there are potential adverse effects such as agranulocytosis.\n\n【53】Surgery should be considered in large goitres when rapid relief is needed. The other advantage is that it provides tissue for a pathological diagnosis. Disadvantages include surgical mortality and morbidity； hypothyroidism and persistence or recurrence of hyperthyroidism.\n\n【54】Radioiodine is an appealing option in the majority of the patients because it is highly effective for reversal of hyperthyroidism.

Most hairs (80%–90%) on the scalp at any given moment are in the anagen phase and thus, patients can experience a uniform loss of hair of this magnitude. The most common cause of anagen effluvium is classically seen in those undergoing chemotherapy, as dividing cells display high metabolic activity and thus take up the drug more rapidly, but other medications and inflammatory disorders have also been implicated. Hair loss in anagen effluvium is often reversible as the quiescent stem cells responsible for the initiation of follicular regrowth are unharmed. Removal of the offending agent or treatment of the implicated conditions often results in resolution and regrowth. The clinical picture with a thorough history and physical exam is key for diagnosis but clinicians may also rely on laboratory techniques such as microscopy and even biopsy for an anagen-to-telogen ratio. Management is centered around patient education, coping strategies, and decreasing the duration and amount of hair loss experienced. Patient education should focus on the natural course and likely reversibility of hair loss as well as daily preventative measures including grooming strategies and hair care. While these aid in the management of both psychological and emotional distress these patients may experience, it is important to assure social support and to offer counseling appropriately. With appropriate use, external devices, such as scalp cooling, which induces vasoconstriction, and scalp tourniquet application, which clamps arteries supplying the scalp, have been shown to reduce the degree of hair loss. Medical intervention, with agents such as minoxidil, which induces arterial vasodilation, may be used topically to promote hair growth but does not prevent hair loss.\n\n【11】Keywords\n\n【12】Anagen effluvium Non-cicatricial Alopecia Chemotherapy Scalp cooling Minoxidil\n\n【13】A 55-year-old female presented with almost complete loss of hair on the scalp and the rest of the body, including her eyebrows and eyelashes.

The toxic insults most commonly occur from medications, especially chemotherapy, but it also occurs with other inflammatory insults. As a result, AE has become synonymous with chemotherapy-induced alopecia (CIA) as other causes are rare and often not considered unless indicated by the clinical picture. AE in the context of drug-administration can be classified within drug-induced alopecia. Drug-administration and inflammatory conditions may also cause patients significant distress, so, in these scenarios, it is important to differentiate AE from telogen effluvium (TE) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】The inflammatory or toxic insult in AE results in diffuse hair loss as 90% of hairs on a scalp are in the anagen phase. The anagen phase, or growth phase, of the hair cycle lasts between 2 and 6 years during which epithelial proliferation of the bulb matrix cells forms the hair shaft. Consequently, these cells demonstrate both high metabolic activity and pigmentation which leaves them particularly susceptible to insult 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. This insult disrupts epithelial proliferation, and impedes cellular mitosis at the bulb matrix, damaging the shaft, and ultimately resulting in hair breakage or loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. This results in rapid, diffuse hair loss, often greater than 100 hairs per day over a period of 2–4 weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. However, since the quiescent stem cells that continue to initiate follicle growth are spared, hair loss is usually completely reversible 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】AE is most commonly seen in patients receiving cytotoxic therapy. Shedding occurs in approximately 65% of patients using these therapies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. Patients may begin to experience shedding within 14 days of administration of the offending agent and complete hair loss within 1 or 2 months of continued exposure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 5 \\]</u>. Most common medication culprits include chemotherapy agents which inhibit cellular proliferation of anagen hairs, causing apoptosis of the proximal bulb region 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Anti-microtubules, topoisomerase inhibitors, alkylating agents, and antimetabolites have been associated with alopecia with an occurrence of 80%, 60%–100%, greater than 60%, and 10%–50% respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 4 \\]</u>. Other less commonly implicated agents include isoniazid, levodopa, colchicine, cyclosporine, tamoxifen, allopurinol, bromocriptine, high-dose albendazole, and radiation therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 5 , 7 , 8 \\]</u>. AE secondary to these therapies is typically a reversible process that occurs naturally 1–3 months after the removal of the offending agent; however, while CIA is thought to follow this same pattern, recent studies have linked certain classes of chemotherapy to irreversible alopecia or permanent chemotherapy-induced alopecia (PCIA) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. One study reported an incidence of 42.3% of PCIA in patients 3 years after undergoing chemotherapy, with taxane-based agents being the most offending 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. This has also been reported with patients undergoing radiation therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【32】Heavy metals, such as thallium and mercury, are able to disrupt hair shaft formation by binding the sulphydryl group of keratins in the hair. Other heavy metals reported to be associated with AE include boron, and arsenic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Patients would demonstrate systemic symptoms associated with toxic levels of the varying heavy metals as well as elevated blood levels.\n\n【33】Associated medical conditions include autoimmune and inflammatory disorders and severe malnutrition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 5 \\]</u>. Lymphocytes seen in alopecia areata infiltrate the hair follicle which causes the rapid progression from anagen to catagen and telogen and then back to the anagen phase. This continuous cycle changes the follicle’s morphology into a short, incompletely keratinized or pencil point hair that is sensitive to trauma and breakage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. With pemphigus vulgaris, the autoantibodies disrupt hair growth as desmosomal proteins are expressed in the follicle epithelium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Recently, there have also been case reports of COVID-19 related anagen effluvium associated with an urticaria and maculopapular rash that was associated with the massive inflammatory insult related to the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>.\n\n【34】Diagnosis of AE is typically made through history and physical exam. On examination, areas of hair loss will show no signs of active inflammation or scarring such as erythema, scaling, or pigmentation seen in cicatricial alopecia, but will show diffuse hair loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Patients retaining 10%–20% of hair in a uniform distribution is highly specific for AE, especially in the context of association with one of the previously listed medications or medical conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. Microscopy may be helpful to differentiate between conditions, such as TE, which presents with clumping, non-uniform distribution of hair loss with the onset of a significant life stressor, such as chemotherapy induction or systemic disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Microscopically, anagen hairs have full pigmentation with roots covered with inner and outer root sheaths, whereas telogen hairs lack inner and outer root sheaths, as well as pigmentation of the proximal shaft 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. AE hairs will characteristically demonstrate a narrowing, fractured shaft as well 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. A biopsy is rarely required for diagnosis but would show a low (15%) anagen-to-telogen ratio, differentiating it from TE. Follicles would also show no signs of inflammation, dystrophy of the inner sheath, or traction, distinguishing AE from alopecia areata, androgenic alopecia, and traction alopecia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【35】Treatment\n---------\n\n【36】Treatment of anagen effluvium is multifaceted, including decreasing the total quantity of hair loss, decreasing the overall duration of hair loss, increasing patient coping ability, and educating patients on the treatment course. Prior to the development of more current, promising treatments, management largely focused on patient education and the use of aesthetic devices. Patients may still choose this form of management but with the emergence of scalp cooling devices and hair growth medications, these may be utilized less often 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Current research is largely aimed at eliminating hair loss completely but has largely been unremarkable. Recent clinical trials have shown methods that decrease but do not eliminate hair loss. Cessation of implicating medications and treatment or the resolution of implicating medical conditions has been the only method to lead to complete resolution of anagen effluvium. Reports show that regrowth is scarce and less likely to occur in patients receiving high doses of radiation therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>.\n\n【37】Patient education has been at the forefront of management for patients experiencing or may be experiencing it in the future as many patients experience emotional and psychological distress 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. It is imperative to educate patients not only on the probability of hair loss, but also on the current recommendations, course, and reversibility of it 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Recommendations for hair care before and during treatment include avoiding physical and chemical trauma to the scalp and hair (bleach, color, perm, irons, rollers) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 4 \\]</u>. Other recommendations include scarcely washing hair and the use of a satin pillowcase. Patients should be educated on coping strategies such as keeping their hair shorter, as this helps it appear fuller, as well as considering the use of an aesthetic covering, such as a hairpiece, wig, or scarf 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. These have the added benefit of scalp protection from sun and cold exposure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【38】Currently, the mainstay of treatment for medication-induced AE has been to reduce the quantity of offending agent delivered to the scalp follicles. This can be done with the application of a scalp tourniquet, clamping arteries, or inducing scalp hypothermia, causing arteriolar vasoconstriction. These techniques are especially effective for chemotherapy agents that have short half-lives and are rapidly cleared 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【39】Scalp cooling has been well-studied and is shown to be highly effective in significantly reducing this effect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Influencing factors include the type and dose of medication, as well as the degree of scalp temperature reduction. Studies have shown beneficial outcomes with temperature reduction below 22 degrees Celsius 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. Mechanically, scalp cooling would be beneficial to reduce the delivery of any systemic medication to the scalp, with most evidence shown through studies in breast-cancer patients on anthracycline therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 , 18 \\]</u>. Therefore, the lowest efficacious dose would likely have the lowest risk of inducing AE. Studies have also looked at specific cooling systems, such as the Paxman PCS-2 (PAX). This system is most efficacious at reducing the risk of AE when used with a cold cap (CC) during therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. With the emergence and efficacy of this intervention, there is an enormous potential to ease the psychological burden of this unpleasant side effect and improve patient quality of life as some patients report treatment hesitancy and decline it in fear of hair loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 20 \\]</u>. Common adverse effects include a sensation of cold, scalp discomfort, and headaches 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 19 \\]</u>. Scalp cooling is contraindicated in patients with hematological malignancies due to its mechanism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【40】Scalp tourniquet devices have been shown to be effective in preventing hair loss in some studies, but populations and techniques have not been uniform, needing to account for different techniques, type of chemotherapy regimen, and amount of external pressure applied 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u>. While generally tolerated, side effects include headache and varying degrees of nerve compression that can induce scalp anesthesia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 17 \\]</u>. Contraindications include any brain or scalp metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【41】Pharmacological intervention is largely employed to reduce the severity and duration of hair loss experienced by patients. Topical minoxidil has been shown to reduce the period of baldness by about 50 days but does not prevent alopecia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 , 17 \\]</u>. While minoxidil does induce local vasodilation to the scalp arteries when applied topically, the leading mechanism for which this drug stimulates hair growth include the increased activity of enzymes, such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase or sulfotransferase, but this is not fully understood 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 , 22 \\]</u>. It has a good safety profile and tolerability with scalp pruritus being the most common side effect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 \\]</u>. Due to the mechanism of arterial vasodilation, its use is only recommended after the discontinuation of the implicating agent or condition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【42】Numerous agents, such as small molecules, biologicals, and medications have shown promise in preliminary studies but failed larger clinical trials. These include keratinocyte growth factor, and combinations of topical dexamethasone, calcitriol, and calcipotriol or calcineurin inhibitors, interleukin-1, and calcitriol 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【43】Key Points\n----------\n\n【44】*   Anagen effluvium is diffuse hair loss caused by toxic or inflammatory insult to hair follicles during the anagen phase of the hair cycle.\n\n【45】*   Toxic insult from patients undergoing treatment with chemotherapeutic agents is the most common cause of anagen effluvium, but other medications and inflammatory conditions have been implicated.\n\n【46】*   Patient management is centered around patient education and coping strategies, as well as decreasing the duration of hair loss through mechanical and pharmacological interventions.\n\n【47】*   Minoxidil is the mainstay of pharmacological therapy while the application of scalp cooling and tourniquets have shown benefit as external devices during chemotherapy treatment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

He was born  删除换行 at 39 weeks’ gestation by normal vaginal delivery in a midwife-led birthing unit and was  删除换行 discharged home the same day. There was no prolonged rupture of membranes and he did  删除换行 not require any resuscitation at birth. He has been exclusively breast-fed. He did not receive  删除换行 vitamin K due to parental objection.\n\n【3】Examination\n\n【4】Freddie is grunting and has a respiratory rate of 70 breaths/min with subcostal, intercostal  删除换行 and sternal recession. His lung fields sound clear. Oxygen saturation monitoring does not  删除换行 pick up a trace. He looks mottled, cyanosed peripherally and his limbs feel cold.

The PaCO2 is normal, so the acidosis is not  删除换行 respiratory in origin. The low bicarbonate and large negative base excess indicate that this is  删除换行 a metabolic acidosis. There is also a degree of hypoxaemia. Freddie’s circulation is so poor  删除换行 that pulses are not palpable, the saturation monitor cannot pick up a pulse trace and a severe  删除换行 metabolic acidosis has been developed due to hypoperfusion.\n\n【17】This is most likely to be a case of cardiogenic shock due to a congenital left heart obstructive  删除换行 lesion. The clues are in the age of the baby and the absence of the femoral pulses. Left-sided  删除换行 obstructive cardiac lesions rely on the ductus arteriosus to perfuse the systemic circulation  删除换行 by passage of blood from the pulmonary arteries into the distal end of the aortic arch. As  删除换行 the ductus arteriosus closes, the systemic perfusion becomes dramatically reduced, result删除8：<u>￾</u>ing in collapse and shock. Freddie actually had hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS).

Its use has continued to escalate in the United States and worldwide. Estimates of emergency room (ER) visits in the United States related to cocaine abuse account for over 500,000 visits per year, which presents a significant burden on our healthcare system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 , 16 \\]</u>. These visits are usually related to cardiovascular complaints such as chest pain, palpitations, and severe hypertension which are caused by increased inotropic and chronotropic effects and increased peripheral vasoconstriction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 , 16 \\]</u>. Cocaine abuse is also a major source of morbidity and mortality that causes long-term cognitive impairment and often leads to early death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 – 20 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】Cocaine and methamphetamine are both highly addictive and have similar actions; they are both cardiac stimulants that lead to euphoria and cardiovascular complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>. Amphetamines are often used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and are the second most widely used illicit drug in the United States, second only to cannabis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. Chronic cocaine and methamphetamine abuse can lead to coronary artery disease (CAD), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), ischemic cardiomyopathy, severe palpitations, aortic dissection, malignant hypertension, methamphetamine-associated cardiomyopathy (MACM), dysrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death (SCD) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. Acute ischemia with subsequent myocardial infarction is generally related to coronary artery vasospasm and tachyarrhythmias 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>. The number of cocaine users in the United States in 1985 was estimated at 5.8 million, but by 2016, the total number of cocaine users had increased to an estimated 18.2 million worldwide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】Cocaine is a powerfully addictive stimulant that is a naturally occurring alkaloid extracted from the leaves of _Erythroxylum coca,_ first isolated in 1860 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. The effect of cocaine on the cardiac muscle and coronary blood vessels remains poorly understood 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>. Cocaine affects endothelial cells by stimulating the release of endothelin-1, a potent vasoconstrictor, and inhibiting the production of nitric oxide, a major vasodilator 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 \\]</u>. Cocaine also blocks sodium and potassium channels across the cell membrane during depolarization and causes local anesthesia leading to abnormal, depressed cardiovascular profiles 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 , 24 \\]</u>. Concurrent abuse of cocaine and alcohol significantly increases cocaine levels in the blood 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 \\]</u>. Cocaine and methamphetamine are both highly addictive and have similar actions in that they are both cardiac stimulants that lead to euphoria and cardiovascular complications. Chronic cocaine and methamphetamine abuse can lead to coronary artery disease (CAD), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), ischemic cardiomyopathy, severe palpitations, aortic dissection, malignant hypertension, methamphetamine-associated cardiomyopathy (MACM), dysrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death (SCD) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 , 20 \\]</u>.\n\n【27】Cocaine can be either ingested orally, by inhalation, injection, rectally or vaginally. The inhalation route has a more rapid onset and a shorter duration of action compared with ingestion. Its half-life is variable depending on its route of administration and varies from 1 min to up to 2 h. Cocaine is excreted primarily by urination and can remain in the urine or bloodstream for up to 72 h 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 , 24 , 25 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】16.8 Clinical Presentation and Diagnostic Testing in Setting of Cocaine and Methamphetamine Use\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【29】Given the severity of symptoms, patients often present for urgent evaluation.

The average age of new MA users in 2016 was 23.3 years old. In North America, MA abusers are predominately in their 30s and 40s, but use has also been reported in adolescents because of the lower cost and longer duration of action than cocaine. An estimated 964,000 people aged 12 or older (about 0.4% of the population) had a MA use disorder in 2017 with clinically significant impairment, including health problems, disability, and failure to meet responsibilities at work, school, or home as a result of their drug use. This number is significantly higher than the 684,000 people who reported having methamphetamine use disorder in 2016. A 2009 report from the RAND Corporation noted that methamphetamine misuse cost the nation approximately $23.4 billion in 2005. Most of the MA abused in the United States is produced in superlabs that are located in Mexico; however, it is also relatively easy and inexpensive to produce on a small scale 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>.\n\n【59】### 16.9.2 Pathophysiology of Methamphetamine-Induced Cardiomyopathy\n\n【60】Methamphetamine (MA) is a powerful, highly addictive stimulant related to amphetamine that affects the central nervous system. It generally increases energy levels, false sense of well-being, and often makes users hyperactive. These effects often last for about 8–20 h, depending on urine pH, recent use, and recent dosage. Eventually, there is a significant crash which often leads to depression, severe mood swings, agitation, and strong cravings for more methamphetamine. It is available in powder and crystalline forms and can be taken orally, intravenously, snorted, or smoked. The smokable form of methamphetamine produces an immediate euphoria similar to crack cocaine but the effects may last much longer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>.\n\n【61】### 16.9.3 Clinical Presentation and Diagnostic Testing\n\n【62】Acute MA overdose can result in sympathetic overdrive, intracranial hemorrhage, cardiovascular collapse, rhabdomyolysis, ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. Acute presentation to the Emergency Department (ED) may include chest pain, aortic dissection, myocardial ischemia and/or infarction, hypertension, palpitations, tachyarrhythmias, dyspnea, and edema. They may demonstrate agitation, violent behavior, new onset seizures, psychosis, paranoia, headache, abdominal pain, or obstructions. These patients should be sent to the ED.\n\n【63】Initial diagnostic testing is similar to the section on cocaine abuse with the addition of CT of the head if clinically indicated, and low-dose CT abdominal imaging if body-packers, body-stuffers, or parachuters are suspected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. Immediate management is focused on treating the presenting symptoms (ACS, chest pain, arrhythmias, agitation).\n\n【64】16.10 Additional Considerations for the Primary Care Provider for Methamphetamine-Induced Cardiomyopathy\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【65】Patients with cocaine-induced or methamphetamine-induced cardiomyopathy most often present to the emergency room given the severity of acute to chronic symptoms. Longitudinal follow-up after initial diagnosis is extremely important to improve prognosis and outcomes. Treating underlying addiction along with a comprehensive assessment of psychosocial factors is imperative.\n\n【66】16.11 Case Study: Methamphetamine-Induced Cardiomyopathy\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【67】Name: JB\n\n【68】Age/Sex: 56 y/o AAM.\n\n【69】Past Medical History/Problem List:\n\n【70】Cocaine abuse, in remission for 2–3 months before the initial visit.\n\n【71】Dilated cardiomyopathy with hypotension that prevented maximizing Guideline-Directed medical therapy (GDMT)\n\n【72】Hypertension was diagnosed 8–10 years ago.\n\n【73】Osteoarthritis of both knees.\n\n【74】Hyperlipidemia, newly diagnosed.\n\n【75】No insurance.\n\n【76】Family History: Negative for CAD and heart failure\n\n【77】Social History: Single, lives alone, works as a driver for a local church.

They are very rare tumors, and some authors have suggested that they make up around 0.5 % of all soft tissue tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Frequent locations are the tongue (40 %), breast (15 %), respiratory tract (10 %), and esophagus (2 %) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The tumour can often be multicentric (5–14 % of cases) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. These tumors have a higher incidence amongst women and a greater prevalence amongst black people. There has also been a case report of a mother and son – both of whom presented in childhood with multiple granular cell tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】While the origins of granular cell tumors are often debated and Abrikossoff originally postulated a myogenic origin and termed this a ‘myoblastoma’, they are now considered to be neoplasms of neural origin, as evidenced immuno-histochemical studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. However, there have been reports of dermal non-neural granular cell tumors in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】It is considered difficult by some authors to make a diagnosis of malignancy in these tumors on the basis of cellular pleomorphism, mitotic activity, or ultrastructural findings; macroscopic features such as size greater than 5 cm, rapid growth rate, or invasion of adjacent structures are more likely to suggest malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Most Granular Cell Tumors are benign with a self-limiting growth pattern; however, when they metastasize, the commonest sites are to the regional lymph nodes, lungs or bones 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Granular Cell Tumors are rare on the trunk and usually present as a solitary painless mass, with the patient usually noticing a lump 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】The case we are presenting is that of a young white male aged 27, who presented with a 2-month history of a 2 cm mass on his buttock which was preventing him from sitting down due to pain. Our initial clinical impression of this fibro-fatty mass was initially of a well-circumscribed lipoma or neurofibroma and the differential diagnosis included a cyst. The pain and tenderness to touch were attributed to pressure effects on his sciatic nerve. Given this was a young male patient presenting with a painful dermal/subcutaneous mass, we did not consider a granular cell tumour until histopathological examination, due to this unusual case presentation.\n\n【20】Case History\n\n【21】A 27 year-old white male was referred to our centre by his GP with a lump noted by the referring doctor on the patient’s right buttock. The mass was 2 cm in diameter and was felt to be a lipoma clinically. The patient himself was not aware of the lump and had visited his GP only because every time he sat down he felt pain over his buttock region, which was radiating down his leg. This symptom was consistently reproducible and prevented the patient from sitting down on a hard surface like a wooden bench.\n\n【22】The patient was otherwise well with no medical conditions or medications. There was no family history of any malignancy or cutaneous masses or lipomata.\n\n【23】On examination, we felt a well localized an approximately 2 cm soft tissue mass which was clinically located in the deep dermis or the subcutaneous fat. There was no attachment to muscle and no overlying skin changes. Our differential diagnoses included a lipoma or neurofibroma. Given the lesion was well-localized, not greater than 2 cm and not adherent to muscle or deep fascia, we proceeded to excision of the lesion under local anesthesia without imaging.\n\n【24】During the operation, the lesion seemed well localized and intra-operatively appeared to resemble a sebaceous cyst or pilomatrixoma.\n\n【25】Histological reports are detailed below. A compete skin and lymph node examination revealed no other abnormalities. After reviewing the histopathology, this patient was managed with a wide local excision with 1 cm margins.\n\n【26】Histopathological examination:\n\n【27】The tumour was well-circumscribed, spanned the entire dermis and showed broad interface with the underlying adipose tissue. The interface with the epidermis was quite irregular, with prominent epidermal pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia .\n删除3：<u>Figure 12.1</u>\n\n【28】H&E, 20× magnification\n删除3：<u>Figure 12.2</u>\n\n【29】H&E, 100× magnification\n\n【30】This feature creates a well-know pitfall that may happen in a limited sample of a granular cell tumour. One can see how easy a diagnosis of invasive well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma can be made in a superficial biopsy sample. This can lead to a potentially harmful surgery, especially when the lesion is present in the tongue, which is a common site for Granular Cell Tumors. The tumor cells are quite monomorphous, with small round nuclei and abundant granular eosinophilic cytoplasm . The tumor cells were diffusely positive with S-100 immunohistochemical stain.\n删除3：<u>Figure 12.3</u>\n\n【31】H&E, 400× magnification\n\n【32】Discussion\n----------\n\n【33】Granular Cell Tumors are uncommon and when they occur they are most common on the head and neck. Surgical excision is the treatment of choice. The recurrence rate for Granular Cell Tumors has been reported at 2 %, when local wide excision has been undertaken 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Most Granular Cell Tumors can be easily managed by wide local excision; however, in cosmetically sensitive areas where tissue preservation is paramount – such as the penis, Mohs Micrographic Surgery has been used 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Our patient was unusual, given it was the symptomatic nature of the lesion that led to the diagnosis – the patient was unable to sit due to buttock pain which resulted in the initial referral, and the impression during surgery was of a cyst, neurofibroma or a pilomatrixoma. A survey of buttock tumors suggested that when pain is present, it is usually due to cyst formation in old haematomas, and pain along the course of the sciatic nerve and its branches was present in 40 % of the cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【34】Granular Cell Tumors are usually painless masses in the head, neck or extremities and hence in our patient, the diagnosis was only made subsequently upon histological examination. It is interesting that as far as Granular Cell Tumors are concerned, when malignant cases are reported (in 1–2 %), the most common site is the soft tissue of the thigh, rather than the head and neck area. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u> The malignant versions of Granular Cell Tumors are more common in African-American females, and the mean age range of patient with malignant tumors is similar to the benign group i.e. 30–50 years. The treatment of choice is wide complete local excision, as was performed in our patient. The recurrence rate after incomplete excision results in a recurrence rate of 21–50 % 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. This case report suggests that Granular Cell Tumors must be considered in the differential diagnoses of lipomas. Several authors have mistaken them for lipomas. Approximately 5 % of GCT occur in the gastrointestinal tract, with predilection for the esophagus. Due to the similarity in endoscopic appearance, some gastroenterologists 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u> suggest granular cell tumors may often be mistaken for lipomas and are perhaps more common than the reported literature suggests.\n\n【35】While they are rare, they are commoner in blacks and show a slight female preponderance. Usually presenting as solitary and painless masses, less than 10 % are multiple, and fewer than 3 % of tumors show features of malignancy. Mean age is 40–60 years. An interesting report noted a 45-year-old man with a single, firm, painless and mobile cutaneous nodule 2 cm in size on his right arm. This was excised and the histology confirmed as a granular cell tumour 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. However, the authors in this case noted a strange occurrence. Four years after the initial diagnosis, the patient presented with enlarging subcutaneous nodules on the trunk, left arm and left buttock, associated with a drop in hemoglobin.\n\n【36】A nodule was surgically removed from the left buttock, and this time the histopathological examination revealed a granular cell tumour with malignant features. The authors caution that in benign cutaneous granular cell tumors, as our case was, recurrences can occur many years after the original diagnosis. Therefore long-term follow up is important. This recurrence may involve malignant transformation and also involve gastrointestinal organs besides the skin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. Indeed authors have reported granular cell tumors as ‘incidental findings’ when haemorrhoids have been removed and histological analysis has been done 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. There is also a report of a cutaneous granular cell tumor of skin of the arm diagnosed on fine needle aspiration cytology, which the clinicians had felt was a possible dermatofibroma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. The authors in this case comment that while in most cases the cytological features are distinctive enough, soft tissue sarcomas need to be excluded. As they note, sarcomas typically show prominent nucleoli, multinucleated cells, and the characteristic rhomboid crystals. The absence of cross-striations and glycogen distinguishes a granular cell tumour from a rhabdomyoma while the absence of lipid droplets excludes a lipoma-variant such as a hibernoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>.\n\n【37】And recently, in a large multi-centre study of 119 cases of granular cell tumors of skin, the authors studied the propensity of vascular invasion and other invasive features in granular cell tumors of the skin – and noted that infiltration of arrector pili muscle occurred in 23 % and perineural spread in 66 % of cases. While vascular invasion occurred in 23 % of cases, no intraluminal embolus was found. Therefore vascular invasion of granular cell tumors of the skin consists of an infiltration of the subendothelial layers, without intraluminal cells, and is not necessarily a marker of adverse prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>.\n\n【38】Just as authors earlier mistook a granular cell tumour for a dermatofibroma, there is a paper where the lesion was initially diagnosed clinically as a dermatofibrosarcoma or a spontaneous keloid only to end up as granular cell tumour of skin on histological examination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. Granular cell tumors should therefore be included in the differential diagnosis of scar-like lesions, ‘keloidal lesions’ or lesions suspected of being lipomata. These tumors should be removed completely and patients then examined regularly to detect new tumors given the risk of both new tumors and later occurrence of malignancy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

This patient has a history consistent with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus. Long-term hyperglycemia in these patients, reflected by the increased hemoglobin A1c , may result in diabetic nephropathy. The pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy involves non-enzymatic glycosylation of the glomerular and tubule basement membranes, thereby increasing permeability to proteins; hence, microalbuminuria is an early sign of diabetic nephropathy. Nonenzymatic glycosylation is a ubiquitous process in poorly controlled diabetes, and this patient’s neuropathic lower extremity pain likely is due to nonenzymatic glycosylation of nerve fibers. Glomerular hypertrophy also occurs due to cytokine release. On light microscopy, early changes show diffuse mesangial expansion in the glomeruli, whereas more advanced diabetic nephropathy (as might be seen in this patient) demonstrates nodular glomerulosclerosis (Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules). Nodular glomerulosclerosis is characterized by increased cellularity and mesangial matrix deposition, as well as hyaline masses and thickening of the lamina densa. Diabetic nephropathy can present with either a nephrotic or a nephritic syndrome, although nephrotic is more common.  \n\n【7】Answer A is incorrect. Diffuse capillary and basement membrane thickening is associated with membranous glomerulonephritis.  \n\n【8】Answer B is incorrect.

The patient’s mother reports that, for the past few weeks, the girl has not eaten well and that she has often felt nauseated and has vomited after the few meals that she has eaten. A few days ago, the girl’s urine darkened and her stool became pale. On physical examination, the physician notes a fever of 38.5°C (101.3°F), hepatomegaly, jaundice, and icterus. A liver enzyme panel reveals an alanine aminotransferase level of 10,103 IU/ml and an aspartate aminotransferase level of 8030 IU/ml. The patient and her mother deny any illicit drug use or sexual contacts or abuse of the patient. The mother also reports that 1 month ago, two of the girl’s playmates had similar symptoms. Which of the following pathogens shares the route of transmission as the pathogen most likely causing this girl’s symptoms?\n\n【1】> (A) Flavivirus\n\n【2】> (B) Hepatitis B virus\n\n【3】> (C) Poliovirus\n\n【4】> (D) Rabies virus\n\n【5】> (E) Varicella-zoster virus\n\n【6】 **Answer**: The correct answer is C . The patient is presenting with the classic signs and symptoms of HAV. Hepatitis often presents with a prodrome of flulike symptoms that is followed by a possible icteric phase during which patients present with jaundice, icterus, hepatomegaly, pruritus, arthralgias, and rashes. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels can exceed 10,000 IU/ml, with ALT > AST levels (as opposed to alcoholic hepatitis, in which AST levels > ALT levels). The next thing to do is to determine which hepatitis virus this is. The patient’s demographics and contact history as well as the lack of any sexual or illicit drug abuse suggest the diagnosis of HAV. Of the viral hepatitides, the hepatitis A and E viruses are transmitted via the fecal-oral route. HAV is not common in the United States, but it is very common in Africa, Asia, and South America. Acquisition in childhood is the norm, and most adults in those areas show seropositivity for HAV. Factors that predispose this population to infection include overcrowding, poor sanitation, and lack of a clean water source. Of the answer options, the only virus that also has a fecal-oral route of transmission is poliovirus, an RNA enterovirus that causes acute flaccid paralysis in <1% of cases.  \n\n【7】Answer A is incorrect . Flavivirus, which is the causative agent of yellow fever, is one of the arboviruses, and it is transmitted by the _Aedes_ mosquito.  \n\n【8】Answer B is incorrect . Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is transmitted sexually and parenterally; this includes both maternal-fetal and blood-borne routes.  \n\n【9】Answer D is incorrect . Rabies virus is transmitted via the bite of an infected animal, which in the United States would most likely be a skunk or a bat.  \n\n【10】Answer E is incorrect .

The wife presents to the doctor with an unusual rash on her palms that is faint and painless, and shares that she had “a bump” on the outside of her labia a few weeks ago that has since healed. Learning that she has had no new sexual partners, the physician sends her for a blood test. Testing confirms presence of syphilis. The provider feels compelled to handle the situation discretely because of his history with the family. Which of the following is the appropriate course of action for the physician?\n\n【1】A. Tell the wife she contracted an infection from the soil while gardening and that she and her husband should be treated. Conduct follow-up testing to ensure treatment success per clinical protocols.\n\n【2】B. Provide the wife with a full clinical picture of syphilis and how she was likely infected, and recommend treatment for her and her husband. Ask the wife to bring her husband in for treatment without contacting health authorities.\n\n【3】C. Invite both patients to receive the wife’s test results together and develop a plan of action for treatment and contact tracing with their consent. Discuss the need for follow-up assays to determine treatment success and refer the patients to couples counseling.\n\n【4】D. Treat each patient as an individual case and as though they do not know one another. Based on the wife’s results, contact her husband to come in for testing, explaining that he may be at risk for syphilis based on the results of the test of one of his sex partners. Offer treatment, contact tracing, follow up, and notify public health authorities.\n\n【5】**Answer**: 4.1 D. Although this is a difficult situation, it is paramount that the married couple be handled as though they do not know each other, confidentially, privately, and thoroughly. Reporting to the public health authorities is also important.\n\n【6】**Question**: 4.2 Which of the following is an example of a clinician using patient-centered rather than public-health–centered clinical decision-making?\n\n【7】A. A patient has the right to make decisions about his or her cancer treatment plan based on a full picture of the risks and benefits it may incur.\n\n【8】B. A patient who lives in a dangerous neighborhood is at greater risk for obesity because of not having a safe environment in which to exercise and increased stress in his living situation.\n\n【9】C. A patient has tuberculosis and is participating in directly observed therapy. The patient is asked to determine the time and place for treatment to ensure compliance.\n\n【10】D. A patient is told the impact that his smoking has on the health of those she lives with, particularly as a risk factor for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) to her infant granddaughter.\n\n【11】**Answer**: 4.2 A. This is an example of beneficence and involves the patient’s reviewing the cancer treatment risks and benefits on the individual patient. The other examples deal with public health issues.\n\n【12】**Question**: 4.3 Public health includes 3 core functions. Which of the following best describes the components of the core function of assessment?\n\n【13】A. Researching pathways to care and barriers to service among newly arrived immigrants.\n\n【14】B. Developing data profiles of special groups to depict the higher incidence of alcoholism among one group based on surveillance data.\n\n【15】C. Conducting town hall meetings in the community to develop better community cohesion and a unified purpose.\n\n【16】D. Supporting early entry into prenatal care through a nurse–social worker case management program.\n**Answer**: 4.3 B. Assessment means developing data profiles of special groups to depict the higher incidence of a disease or condition in a group. In this example, this refers to alcoholism in a specific group.\n\n【17】KEY POINTS\n\n【18】 Public health is the assessment of communities, the development of policy to address the needs and assets of communities, and the assurance of health of the individuals in those communities.\n\n【19】 Public health ethics differs from bioethics in its valuation of interdependence over autonomy and its recognition of the connection between the wellness of people and the wellness of their communities.\n\n【20】 Disease investigation and interruption of the chain of transmission are public health essential services. Individuals participate in public health through screening for STIs.\n\n【21】 The public is protected from infections and their sequelae by the interruption of infection through mandatory public reporting and public health partner testing and treatment infrastructure.\n\n【22】 Clinicians and laboratories should familiarize themselves with applicable reporting requirements within their public health jurisdiction. Contact state and local public health officials to clarify any questions about reporting requirements as well as to discuss regulations related to contact tracking (eg, partner notification) and expedited partner therapy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The patient has a recent history of travel involving camping and swimming near an unfiltered water source.\n\n【8】• Organism most likely causing disease: _Giardia lamblia_ , a protozoan agent of disease, is transmitted via the fecal–oral route and leads to malabsorption.\n\n【9】• Primary virulence factors: The cyst forms of _Giardia_ are the primary infectious agent due to their ability to survive for extended periods of time without a host, typically in water. The cysts are moderately resistant to chlorinated water found in most swimming pools and are acid-resistant, allowing passage of the organism through the stomach and into the duodenum. The trophozoite form uses ventral disk structures to adhere to the duodenal epithelium, allowing the infection to persist.\n\n【10】### CLINICAL CORRELATION\n\n【11】_G. lamblia_ is the causative agent of Giardiasis, which is an intestinal infection that presents with diarrhea usually persisting for weeks, although in rare cases it can last for months. The onset of symptoms typically coincides with the onset of cyst excretion, usually 1 to 2 weeks postinoculation. Giardiasis is characterized by greasy, foul-smelling stools typically known as steatorrhea. Not all infections of _Giardia_ are symptomatic. A typical patient presenting with Giardiasis will often have a history of recent travel, either to a third-world nation with poor water sanitation or to remote wilderness settings where they may have drunk from a contaminated stream. Other sources of infection are daycare contacts, toddler swimming pools, or person-to-person spread, usually in the context of sexual activity involving oral–anal contact. _Giardia_ normally presents with mild symptoms such as diarrhea and cramping abdominal pain. However, longer-term complications can arise in chronic cases due to malabsorption, particularly in immunocompromised patients.\n\n【12】The diarrhea found in patients with Giardiasis is secondary to malabsorption of which the precise mechanisms are poorly understood. Large numbers of organisms can mechanically block the absorptive surface of intestinal mucosa and also do damage to the brush border, particularly in the duodenum and jejunum. The organism is also known to deconjugate bile salts, thereby impeding absorption of lipids—this is responsible for the foul-smelling, greasy consistency of the stool, otherwise known as steatorrhea.\n\n【13】Chronic malabsorption may additionally lead to growth retardation, hypoalbuminemia, and deficiencies of vitamin A, B12, and folate. In some patients, acquired lactose intolerance will occur, manifesting with an exacerbation in diarrheal symptoms following ingestion of dairy products that may persist for weeks to months following resolution of the parasitic disease.\n\n【14】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【15】#### Suspected _Giardia_ Infection\n\n【16】### OBJECTIVES\n\n【17】1\\. Know the morphology, environmental sources, and pathogenic properties of the organism _G. lamblia_ .\n\n【18】2\\. Recognize the clinical disease associated with _Giardia_ infection and how this disease is both diagnosed and treated.\n\n【19】### DEFINITIONS\n\n【20】STEATORRHEA: The presence of excess fat in the feces. Patients suffering malabsorption of fat will often describe greasy, foul-smelling stools that can float in the toilet or be difficult to flush and may also present with a recent history of weight loss or symptoms of fat-soluble vitamin deficiency\n\n【21】MALABSORPTION: Difficulty absorbing nutrients from food due to a pathogenic or physiologic abnormality. This can present as the impairment of absorption of single or multiple types of nutrients, depending on the cause\n\n【22】### DISCUSSION\n\n【23】_Characteristics of_ Giardia lamblia\n\n【24】_Giardia_ is one of the few protozoans known to cause disease in humans. Unlike _Trichomonas vaginalis_ , another well-known protozoan agent of disease, _Giardia_ possesses 2 forms: a trophozoite and a cyst form. The trophozoite is perhaps the most recognizable, appearing teardrop-shaped with a face-like appearance due to its two nuclei and central parabasal bodies. The four pairs of flagella complete the image by hanging off of the “face” like hair and a beard. _Giardia_ trophozoites use ventral disc structures to adhere to epithelium, usually in the duodenum or jejunum of patients. This position allows passive extraction of nutrients before the majority of nutrient absorption through the intestines occurs. The cyst form is the infectious stage , and due to its wall, it can survive in water for months and resist the concentrations of chlorine used by municipal water sources for sterilization .\n\n【25】### DIAGNOSIS\n\n【26】The diagnosis of Giardiasis is typically made by light microscopy of the stool using either wet or permanent preps. This test is specific for the diagnosis of Giardiasis but should be repeated up to three times on separate days to increase its sensitivity. Staining is also useful for ruling in or out other causes in the differential diagnosis. Due to the concentration variability of _Giardia_ in the stool, various immunoassays can be used and provide greater sensitivity at the expense of increased cost. These include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against Giardia antigen 65 and direct immunofluorescent assays that use fluorescein-tagged monoclonal antibodies.\n\n【27】When noninvasive testing of stool does not provide a diagnosis, aspiration or biopsy of the duodenal mucosa may be useful for reaching a definitive diagnosis. In Giardiasis, histology usually visualizes villous atrophy ranging from mild to severe in the worst cases, in which disruption of the microvilli may also be visualized.\n\n【28】### TREATMENT AND PREVENTION\n\n【29】Tinidazole is the recommended treatment for Giardiasis in adults and children. It has proven efficacy over the classic treatment, metronidazole , which is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in Giardiasis. In _Giardia_ cases resistant to tinidazole (and metronidazole), nitazoxanide has been shown to be effective in vitro and is FDA approved. Alternative medications sometimes used off-label to treat Giardiasis include: paromomycin, quinacrine, and furazolidone. There is no vaccine available for prevention. Prevention is best accomplished by proper sanitation of water, regular hand washing, and avoidance of consumption of contaminated products or water from contaminated sources. While traveling one should only drink purified water and avoid eating foods that may have been cooked, cleaned, or grown in contaminated water.\n\n【30】###", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The newborn choked and gagged on the first glucose water feed. A contrast study confirmed the diagnosis. An NG tube is in place. The infant is receiving nasal cannula oxygen at 300 mL/min.\n\n【10】VS: HR = 158/min; BP = 88/52 mmHg; RR = 44/min; _T_ \\= 37.2 °C; SpO <sub>2 </sub> \\= 95%;\n\n【11】Hgb = 13.0 g/dl.\n\n【12】Preoperative Evaluation\n-----------------------\n\n【13】Questions\n\n【14】1.  1.\n\n【15】    Is this an emergency? What historical information might have helped anticipate the diagnosis? Are there other, safer, means to make the diagnosis than a contrast study?\n\n【16】2.  2.\n\n【17】    What other evaluations of the newborn are needed prior to undertaking the induction of anesthesia? What conditions are likely or associated with EA/TEF?\n\n【18】3.  3.\n\n【19】    Is a preoperative gastrostomy with local anesthesia indicated? Would the situation be different if the patient were preterm with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) ?\n\n【20】Answers\n\n【21】1.  1.\n\n【22】    While repair of the esophageal atresia (EA) with tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) may not be a true emergency, it is, at the least, very urgent. The longer the newborn is unrepaired, the greater the risk for aspiration. Surgical correction should proceed very quickly, but proper preparation can be accomplished in short order. The diagnosis can be suspected in cases of maternal polyhydramnios. In the delivery room, inability to pass a suction catheter into the stomach should raise the suspicion of EA. A contrast study is not needed to make the diagnosis. Aspiration of oral contrast is a significant risk. Plain X-rays may show the dilated, air-filled esophageal pouch. A film with a radiopaque catheter coiled in that pouch will confirm the diagnosis. If there is no gas in the abdomen, it is possible that the child has EA without TEF.\n\n【23】2.  2.\n\n【24】    It is important to ascertain which type of TEF is present. In cases of esophageal atresia, >90% have an associated tracheoesophageal fistula. The most common variant of a TEF, by far (90%), is esophageal atresia with a distal fistula between the posterior trachea near the carina and the stomach. The next most common, approximately 7–8%, is EA without TEF. Many other types and subtypes have been described. Up to 50% of patients with EA/TEF have other congenital anomalies. Cardiovascular anomalies make up one-third of the anomalies seen in these patients. The cardiac anomalies seen are, in order of occurrence, VSD, ASD, tetralogy of Fallot, and coarctation of the aorta. Other organ systems involved in these patients are musculoskeletal (30%), gastrointestinal (20%), and GU (10%). Patients with EA/TEF may have the VATER syndrome that consists of vertebral defects or VSD, anal/arterial defects, TEF/EA, and radial or renal anomalies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】1.  3.\n\n【26】    There are three methods used to decrease or eliminate insufflation of the stomach with the inspired gas from the endotracheal tube. The endotracheal tube tip can be placed beyond the fistula, just above the carina, but in some cases the fistula is actually at the carina making this procedure impossible. In cases where the newborn is having severe respiratory compromise and positive pressure ventilation has been instituted, a ventilator breath may follow a path from the trachea through the fistula and distend the stomach. The abdomen can become very distended, further compromising ventilation. In these dire situations, an emergent gastrostomy may allow the abdominal pressure to be relieved enough for ventilation to continue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Approximately 25% of newborns with EA/TEF are born preterm, and in cases with respiratory distress, the situation is even more difficult since institution of positive pressure ventilation will require higher pressures. This will invariably also put gas into the stomach through the fistula. In cases when ventilation of the lungs is ineffective or incomplete, another option in addition to an emergency gastrostomy is placement of a balloon-tipped catheter through the fistula into the stomach, inflating the balloon and occluding the fistula. This can be accomplished by placing the balloon-tipped catheter through the fistula from the trachea with a rigid bronchoscope. Photo below shows the relative sizes of the right and left bronchi and the fistula with a positive pressure breath. Spontaneous breathing may not illustrate this as well, under direct vision.\n\n【27】Intraoperative Course\n---------------------\n\n【28】Questions\n\n【29】1.  1.\n\n【30】    What monitors would you require for this case? Arterial line? Where? How will you assess intravascular volume? CVP catheter? How much information about preload would a Foley catheter give you for this case?\n\n【31】2.  2.\n\n【32】    What might be done to minimize the effect of the fistula at induction? Is IV or inhalation induction preferable? How should the airway be secured? Does the presence of the fistula alter the techniques for intubation? What should be done with the NG tube once intubation is accomplished?\n\n【33】3.  3.\n\n【34】    Is controlled or spontaneous ventilation preferable for these cases? How would you determine whether or not a percutaneous gastrostomy is indicated prior to the definitive repair? Is a precordial stethoscope of particular importance for these cases?\n\n【35】4.  4.\n\n【36】    After positioning and the start of the thoracotomy , breath sounds from the left axillary stethoscope markedly diminish and the SpO <sub>2 </sub> decreases. What might be the cause? What would you do? Could the endotracheal tube have accidentally entered the fistula?\n\n【37】Answers\n\n【38】1.  1.\n\n【39】    For otherwise well term newborns with EA/TEF, standard monitors with the addition of “pre-” (right hand) and “post-” (left hand or either foot) ductal pulse oximeters and a Foley catheter will often be sufficient. If there is pulmonary compromise, either from aspiration or because of prematurity, an arterial line is useful for frequent ABG determinations. A CVP catheter would not only give some information about intravascular volume but also be an excellent route for administration of resuscitation medications, should that be needed. If peripheral IV access is good in an otherwise well newborn with EA/TEF, the risk of placing a CVP line may not be justified. Urine output should mirror renal blood flow (GFR) but it is a secondary measure. In addition, the small volume produced may be difficult to accurately collect and measure. Nevertheless, this monitor can provide useful information for these cases.\n\n【40】2.  2.\n\n【41】    In cases where the connection between the trachea and esophageal point of entry of the fistula is open, avoidance of positive pressure ventilation is important. Positive pressure ventilation will force gas through the fistula into the stomach. IV access should be secured prior to any attempts at induction of anesthesia or intubation. Awake intubation is often done, followed by spontaneous ventilation with the infant breathing oxygen plus incremental doses of a volatile anesthetic. Alternatively, an inhalation induction can be done, and when an adequate depth of anesthesia has been achieved and the airway anesthetized with the appropriate dose of topical anesthetic, laryngoscopy and intubation can be done. It has been commented that turning the bevel of the endotracheal tube anteriorly will decrease the chance of intubating the fistula, but this is unproven. It also has been suggested that since the fistula is often relatively low in the trachea, a deliberate right main stem intubation should be done and the endotracheal tube then withdrawn to a position just above the carina, hopefully distal to the fistula. Great care is required while advancing the endotracheal tube in the trachea, however. The fistula may be quite large, and the endotracheal tube may easily be placed into the fistula if it is advanced too far into the trachea 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. As mentioned above, an alternative that will allow positive pressure ventilation is performance of a rigid bronchoscopy following induction of anesthesia and placement of an occluding balloon-tipped catheter through the fistula. The balloon is then inflated and the catheter pulled taut, thus closing the fistula 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. This technique allows positive pressure ventilation to proceed without distending the stomach. The surgeon will likely ask that the NG tube be advanced during the procedure to facilitate identification of the esophageal pouch.\n\n【42】3.  3.\n\n【43】    If the stomach distends after intubation, even with gentle assistance of respiratory efforts, and this distention is interfering with ventilation (leading to the use of higher ventilation pressures), percutaneous gastrostomy will allow some control of the situation. The usual position for surgery is left side down for a right thoracotomy. The surgeon retracts the right lung, leaving only the left lung for gas exchange. In this situation, a left axillary stethoscope will give the anesthesiologist immediate information about the adequacy of ventilation. The left bronchus is easily occluded by blood or secretions and may be kinked by the surgeon during the procedure; the anesthesiologist must be aware of these events as soon as they occur 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【44】4.  4.\n\n【45】    Secretions and/or blood may easily occlude the lumen of the trachea or right main bronchus. Additionally, the bronchus is often kinked by surgical retraction during the procedure. Even with occlusion of the fistula by a balloon-tipped catheter, given the relatively large size of some fistulae as seen in the photo above, there still may be room for the tip of the endotracheal tube to completely or partially enter the fistula, greatly decreasing or eliminating ventilation of the lungs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【46】Postoperative Course\n--------------------\n\n【47】Questions\n\n【48】1.  1.\n\n【49】    Is this patient a candidate for extubation at the conclusion of the surgery? If not, how should the newborn be ventilated? Should the NG tube be removed?\n\n【50】2.  2.\n\n【51】    What options are there for postoperative analgesia? Does the presence of VATER or VACTERL (vertebral anomalies, anal atresia, cardiac defects, tracheoesophageal fistula and/or esophageal atresia, renal and radial anomalies, and limb defects) syndrome affect your willingness to use regional analgesia? If the patient has no other anomalies, would regional analgesia be useful for this case? What drugs would you use?\n\n【52】3.  3.\n\n【53】    Following extubation from minimal ventilator settings on postoperative day #1, the patient exhibits respiratory distress with inspiratory stridor. What might be the cause? What therapy would you begin? How would you decide whether or not to reintubate the child?\n\n【54】Answers\n\n【55】1.  1.\n\n【56】    For term infants who undergo a relatively uncomplicated repair, extubation is a possibility, but the intensive care nursery team who will care for the baby should be involved with the decision.\n\n【57】    The mode of ventilation, if extubation will be delayed, should be guided by the intraoperative course. It is often advisable to use a ventilator from the ICN for newborns in the OR since the anesthesia machine ventilators are not specifically designed for use in the newborn. The position of the NG tube is very important. It is generally left in a position such that the tip is just proximal to the esophageal anastomosis.\n\n【58】2.  2.\n\n【59】    Postoperative analgesia can be provided by administration of local anesthetic into the epidural space 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> or via an ultrasound-guided right paravertebral catheter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. If the patient has the VATER association, epidural catheter placement may be problematic, but regional techniques should not be ruled out prior to review of an X-ray of the spine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. If regional analgesia is not undertaken, parenteral opioids can be used to provide analgesia. In either case, cardiorespiratory monitoring must be done 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【60】3.  3.\n\n【61】    Patients with EA/TEF may have significant tracheomalacia at the level of the dilated esophageal pouch. In utero, the dilated esophageal pouch may compress the developing trachea, leading to weakened cartilage. With vigorous inspiration, this area of the trachea may partially collapse, and inspiratory stridor will result. It is unlikely that treatment of this problem with inhaled racemic epinephrine will be effective as it usually is with infectious croup, but if subglottic edema is part of the problem, a trial of this treatment should be undertaken. The trachea should be reintubated if respiratory failure is imminent based on clinical and laboratory criteria. If reintubation is done, exquisite care must be taken with the NG tube, and esophageal intubation must absolutely be avoided.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

As the complaints  删除换行 lead for the practice, you have been asked to respond to the letter.\n\n【2】Questions\n\n【3】• Does confidentiality continue after death?\n\n【4】• Can a relative request access to a patient’s medical records?\n\n【5】• What processes are in place to protect confidentiality and medical records?删除5：<u>96</u>\n删除7：<u>100 Cases in Clinical Ethics and Law</u>\nANSWER 36\n\n【6】Data protection\n\n【7】Medical records often contain sensitive information – both about the individual and in some  删除换行 cases third parties. Anyone who has access to medical records should be aware of how easy  删除换行 it can be to inadvertently break confidentiality. They should also be aware of who can legally  删除换行 request access to patient data. The Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA) deals with the use and  删除换行 handling of confidential information. Data protection principles state that personal data shall  删除换行 be processed fairly and lawfully, obtained only for one or more specified lawful purposes, be  删除换行 adequate, relevant and not excessive, be accurate and up-to-date, and not be kept for longer  删除换行 than necessary. The DPA entitles patients to view their own medical records. Individuals can  删除换行 request to see their medical records, but a doctor has the responsibility to remove any infor删除8：<u>￾</u>mation in the records that pertains to a third person.\n\n【8】The Caldicott Report 通用删除7(英):<u>(1997)</u> gives guidance on how the DPA should be employed within  删除换行 the framework of the NHS and states that each NHS trust and GP practice must appoint  删除换行 a ‘Caldicott guardian’. A Caldicott guardian acts as an adviser in situations in which con删除8：<u>￾</u>fidentiality is at risk of being breached. This role has a wide remit including ensuring that  删除换行 waste paper containing patient information is disposed of in a secure way, dealing with drug  删除换行 companies that may want anonymous prescribing data and general practitioners who want  删除换行 to make email referrals without having in place encryption protection on their personal  删除换行 computers. The Caldicott Principles recommend that a healthcare professional must always  删除换行 justify the need for information, use the minimum amount of information possible, ensure  删除换行 that patient information is shared on a strict need-to-know basis only, and ensure that the  删除换行 people with access to information are aware of the importance of keeping the information  删除换行 confidential.\n\n【9】Confidentiality\n\n【10】The duty of confidentiality to a patient also remains after death. The GMC Confidentiality  删除换行 guidance 通用删除7(英):<u>(2009)</u> gives guidance on what to do when information is requested by others about  删除换行 the nature of a patient’s death. It highlights circumstances in which confidentiality should be  删除换行 maintained but also looks at the emotional needs of any relatives that have questions about  删除换行 the nature of a person’s death. Relevant information about the patient’s death should be dis删除8：<u>￾</u>closed in some circumstances, including the following:\n\n【11】• To help a coroner, procurator fiscal or other similar officer with an inquest or fatal  删除换行 accident inquiry\n\n【12】• On death certificates, which must be completed honestly and fully\n\n【13】• When a parent asks for information about the circumstances and causes of a child’s  删除换行 death\n\n【14】• When a partner, close relative or friend asks for information about the circum删除8：<u>￾</u>stances of an adult’s death, and there is no reason to believe that the patient would  删除换行 have objected to such a disclosure\n\n【15】• When a person has a right of access to records under the Access to Health Records \n\n【16】Act 1990\n\n【17】In the above scenario perhaps the best course of action would be to invite the relatives in to  删除换行 have a conversation about the nature of the patient’s presentation, investigations and ongoing  删除换行 treatment. It would allow the relatives a chance to ask questions and for the GP to give open  删除换行 and honest answers. If the relatives still had concerns or felt that negligence had occurred, 97\n\n【18】Ethics and Law in Clinical Practice: Confidentiality 删除换行 then the next step would be to ask them to make a more formal complaint. In most cases,  删除换行 being able to have a conversation about the circumstances of an individual’s death is enough  删除换行 to support the relatives in coming to terms with the death of a loved one.\n\n【19】There has been a lot of public interest in medical record keeping in recent years due to  删除换行 government plans to increase access to medical records both in terms of ease of access by  删除换行 other healthcare workers and by outside organisations in the form of anonymised data. The \n\n【20】National Programme for IT aims to provide online electronic access to medical records by  删除换行 healthcare professionals so that patient information can be accessed from anywhere in the  删除换行 country.\n\n【21】The care.data programme allows information from GP records to be passed to the Health  删除换行 and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC), which will collate information to promote  删除换行 health and social care. In theory this data should be anonymised as the patient’s name will  删除换行 not be shared. However, other identifiable information will be shared including NHS num删除8：<u>￾</u>ber, date of birth and postcode, which leads to a risk of medical records being identified. \n\n【22】The information passed to the HSCIC would also include BMI, smoking habits and early  删除换行 indicators of disease. Although in theory this information will only be used in healthcare  删除换行 promotion and research, there is no guarantee that is could not be accessed or sold to non删除8：<u>￾</u>medical organisations such as insurance companies, which could then increase premiums  删除换行 based on non-individual data. The most controversial aspect of care.data is that inclusion  删除换行 in the programme is ‘opt-out’, which means vulnerable and elderly patients may have their  删除换行 medical data disseminated due to a lack of understanding that it is happening. Due to public  删除换行 concerns, care.data is currently under review.\n\n【23】Key Points\n\n【24】• Maintaining patient confidentiality is necessary to ensure that patients trust doc删除8：<u>￾</u>tors with personal and sensitive information.\n\n【25】• Personal data should be kept safe, used for a proper purpose and only be shared  删除换行 with relevant healthcare professionals.删除5：<u>99</u>\nEthics and Law in Clinical Practice: Confidentiality", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

In this  删除换行 case, the serum osmolality works out to be 379 mosmol/kg. He has a mild metabolic  删除换行 acidosis but significant ketoacidosis is not present (pH >7.3 and only a trace of ketones  删除换行 in the urine). This condition mostly occurs in those with type 2 diabetes, in contrast to  删除换行 diabetic ketoacidosis which occurs in type 1 diabetes. However, the distinction is not  删除换行 absolute and up to a third of cases can present with both elements.\n\n【39】Precipitants of this condition are usually infection (pneumonia and urinary tract infec删除8：<u>￾</u>tion are the most common). Other acute stressors such as myocardial infarction, cerebro删除8：<u>￾</u>vascular accident and surgery can trigger the condition. Significant dehydration, which  删除换行 accompanies this condition, exacerbates electrolyte abnormalities and can cause acute  删除换行 kidney injury.\n\n【40】In this case it is likely that the patient has a severe community-acquired pneumonia that  删除换行 has precipitated this state.\n\n【41】The approach to any critically ill person should start with ABCDE (airway, breathing,  删除换行 circulation, disability, exposure). Each step should consist of an assessment and appropri删除8：<u>￾</u>ate management before moving on to subsequent stages. This approach is a logical way  删除换行 of thinking through and dealing with an acutely ill person. This approach is part of the \n\n【42】IMPACT (Ill Medical Patient’s Acute Care and Treatment) method that is endorsed by the \n\n【43】Federation of the Royal Colleges of Physicians and the Royal College of Anaesthetists.\n\n【44】This man’s airway is certainly at risk owing to his low GCS score: 8 or below is an indi删除8：<u>￾</u>cation that a definitive airway is likely to be needed. An anaesthetist should therefore  删除换行 be present to manage this. In the meantime, basic techniques to keep the airway open \n\n【45】(head tilt and chin lift or jaw thrust) with or without airway adjuncts (oropharyngeal or  删除换行 nasopharyngeal airways) can be used. High-flow oxygen (10 L/min) using a mask with  删除换行 reservoir should be administered to deliver maximal percentage of oxygen (with this  删除换行 device about 85 per cent oxygen can be given).\n\n【46】Once the airway is secured and oxygen delivered his breathing can be assessed. He is  删除换行 noted to be tachypnoeic, which is a response to the metabolic acidosis from renal impair删除8：<u>￾</u>ment secondary to dehydration and sepsis. Auscultation and chest X-ray showed consoli删除8：<u>￾</u>dation at the right base. Saturations are low with a PO2 of 8.2 kPa on air. He has severe  删除换行 respiratory compromise with type 1 respiratory failure. As well as high-flow oxygen he  删除换行 may need assisted ventilation and is at risk of respiratory arrest.\n\n【47】He is hypotensive and tachycardic and requires urgent intravenous access and immedi删除8：<u>￾</u>ate fluid resuscitation. A urinary catheter should be inserted to quantify urinary output. \n\n【48】Shock is defined as inadequate tissue perfusion and several parameters can indicate  删除换行 this (e.g. renal dysfunction, rise in lactate, consciousness level). Shock is likely to be  删除换行 caused by hypovolaemia from fluid depletion and sepsis. An ECG does not show signs  删除换行 of myocardial ischaemia and his JVP is not visible without signs of pulmonary oedema,  删除换行 so cardiogenic shock is unlikely. The initial management is the same. Upon intravenous  删除换行 access a fluid challenge should be given: 250 mL of normal saline should be given over  删除换行 2 minutes. Response should be checked at 5 minutes. He is likely to be severely dehy-120 删除换行 drated and will require large volumes of fluid replacement. However, care must be taken  删除换行 in replacing fluid as he is elderly. In general, the first 2 L of normal saline can be given  删除换行 over the first 2 hours. He may require additional colloid boluses if he becomes hypoten删除8：<u>￾</u>sive. Subsequently care over aggressive fluid resuscitation is required. Sodium should be  删除换行 reduced slowly and not more than about 10 mmol/L in 24 hours. Further fluid type and  删除换行 duration of administration should be gauged on renal and electrolyte profiles and the  删除换行 patient’s haemodynamic status. A central venous line would be helpful to assess central  删除换行 venous pressure in those at risk of heart failure.\n\n【49】Initial observations showed a temperature of 38°C, tachycardia, tachypnoea, and a raised  删除换行 white cell count. He also has evidence of organ failure (renal and neurological). He has all  删除换行 the features of a severe systemic inflammatory response syndrome. It is likely the cause is  删除换行 pneumonia based on the symptoms and signs present. A urine dip did not show evidence  删除换行 of infection, but he should have blood and urine cultures. The combination of hypovolae删除8：<u>￾</u>mic and septic shock is unlikely to respond to fluid resuscitation alone and he will need  删除换行 vasopressor support if he remains hypotensive. Septic shock is associated with a high  删除换行 mortality, up to 50 per cent in some cases. Multi-organ failure is a poor prognostic sign.\n\n【50】In addition to fluids, once sepsis is recognized he should be given antibiotics urgently  删除换行 within the first hour of recognition as advocated by the surviving sepsis campaign (http://\n\n【51】删除9：<u>www.survivingsepsis.org</u>). Antibiotics should ideally be targeted to the underlying source,  删除换行 but broad-spectrum organism cover should be initiated without delay.\n\n【52】Serum glucose is corrected slowly with fluid resuscitation and an insulin sliding scale. \n\n【53】Potassium levels should be checked every hour in the first 4 hours during fluid resuscita删除8：<u>￾</u>tion, as they are likely to decrease as the acidosis improves and the intravascular volume  删除换行 increases.\n\n【54】Renal failure may be exacerbated by underlying diabetes and hypertension, as well as  删除换行 metformin and ramipril. Renal function and hyperkalaemia may improve with fluid  删除换行 resuscitation alone, but renal replacement therapy may be required.\n\n【55】The hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state is a hypercoagulable condition and thrombo删除8：<u>￾</u>prophylaxis is required.\n\n【56】Recognizing that this patient is critically ill is based on the ABCDE approach. Most of  删除换行 the initial management can be instituted in the acute setting, including intubation and  删除换行 invasive monitoring. Once the patient is stable enough he should be transferred to the  删除换行 intensive-care unit for continued management.\n\n【57】KEY POINTS\n\n【58】• Hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state is a serious complication that occurs most  删除换行 commonly in elderly people with type 2 diabetes.\n\n【59】• A common trigger for this is infection.\n\n【60】• Coma is rare but is more likely in those presenting with hypernatraemia.删除5：<u>121</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The image reveals _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ infection. Although rifampin is considered the best anti-tuberculous agent, isoniazid is used for prophylaxis in asymptomatic patients with a positive PPD. A six-month course of isoniazid prevents active tuberculosis (TB) in 90% of patients for at least 20 years. Isoniazid blocks my-colic acid cell wall synthesis and is bactericidal for rapidly multiplying organisms. Vitamin B6 is given with isoniazid to prevent neurotoxicity, an adverse effect of isoniazid therapy.  \n\n【8】Answer A is incorrect . Cycloserine is a broad-spectrum antibiotic active against _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ . Adverse effects related to cycloserine include peripheral neuropathy, psychosis, and seizures. One of the reasons cycloserine is so effective is that it spreads throughout the body, including the cerebrospinal fluid.  \n\n【9】Answer B is incorrect . Combined isoniazid and rifampin therapy is effective for treating _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ . However, the risk of liver toxicity with rifampin outweighs its benefits in patients without active infection.  \n\n【10】Answer D is incorrect . Rifampin is the most potent antituberculous agent available. Rifampin blocks DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, preventing RNA synthesis. Although it is a better agent than isoniazid for preventing active TB infection, it has a significant risk of liver toxicity that outweighs its benefits in this population.  \n\n【11】Answer E is incorrect . Vitamin B6 is given with isoniazid to prevent neurotoxicity, an adverse effect of isoniazid therapy. The other major adverse effect of isoniazid is hepatotoxicity. Rifampin does not cause peripheral neuropathy, and thus coadministration of vitamin B6 is unnecessary.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The patient has a history of chronic low back pain and has been under the care of a physi-cian for the past several weeks. He has been prescribed acetaminophen/hydroco-done (Vicodin) and has been supplementing this medication with extra-strength acetaminophen (500 mg tablets). His family members reported that they found several empty medication bottles at home. His laboratory studies from the emer-gency department revealed normal white blood cell count， hemoglobin， hemato-crit， and platelet counts.

Typically， these medications are divided into 2 categories： hypo glycemics and antihyperglycemics. Agents referred to as antihyperglycemics work to reduce glucose levels， but rarely cause hypoglycemia， even when used in excess； these agents include metformin (glucophage)， alpha-glucosidase inhibitors， and gli-tazones. The aforementioned agents work by reducing hepatic glucose production(metformin and glitazones)， as well as decreasing intestinal glucose absorption (met-formin and a-glucosidase inhibitors). On the other hand， hypoglycemics， namelySulfonylurea toxicity may cause hypoglycemia， which presents as diaphoresis， delirium， progressive decreased level of consciousness， syncope， or coma. The method of toxicity may be an intentional or unintentional overdose， or decreased elimination secondary to renal insufficiency. The duration of action for many sulfo nylureas exceeds 24 hours. Therefore， patients are typically admitted to the hospital and treated with dextrose-containing intravenous fluids in addition to close glucose monitoring. Patients may require intravenous octreotide when they are unrespon-sive to intravenous dextrose. Octreotide is a synthetic somatostatin analog， which suppresses pancreatic insulin release. Adjunctive therapy for patients with sulfonyl-urea overdose includes alkalinization of the urine to increase renal elimination of sulfonylureas.Propofol is a lipid-soluble， sedative-hypnotic agent， and is commonly used in surgi-cal and critical care units. It is metabolized by the liver via oxidation by CYP-450 删除换行 2B6， excreted by the kidneys. Its primary site of action isat the GABA-A receptors. Due to its rapid onset of action and quick metabolism (mean duration of action is3-5 minutes for a single bolus)， propofol is used with increasing frequency in the ICU in patients on mechanical ventilation. It is contraindicated in patients with egg or soybean allergies because of the additives in the formulation of the emulsion in which it is administered. Standard dosing of propofol for sedation is 25-75 ug/kg/min (or 1.5-3 mg/kg/h).\n\n【6】Adverse effects with use of propofol range from pain at the site of injection to death. Patients may experience hypotension， arrhythmias (both bradycardia and supraventricular tachyarrhythmias have been described)， acute pancreatitis second-ary to hypertriglyceridemia， and/orbronchospasm as a result of propofol administra-tion. Propofol infusion syndrome includes rhabdomyolysis， acute renal failure， lactic acidosis， and hemodynamic instability as a result of prolonged (>48 hours)， high-dose infusion (>5 mg/kg/h) of propofol. There is no specific antidote for pro-pofol toxicity. The treatment is immediate discontinuation of the propofol infusion followed by supportive care. Supportive care may include administration of IV flu-ids， vasopressor， or antiarrhythmic agents.**See also Case 23 (Acute Kidney Injury)， Case 24 (Acid-Base Abnormali-ties I)， and Case 25 (Acid-Base Abnormalities II).**", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

These  删除换行 conditions are —\n\n【51】(a) Bowen's disease.\n\n【52】(b) Senile keratosis.\n\n【53】(c) Lupus vulgaris.\n\n【54】(d) Xeroderma pigmentosum.\n\n【55】(e) Exposure to sunlight or irradiation.

Cancers of scrotal skin is  删除换行 common in chimney sweepers.\n\n【65】Pathology.—\n\n【66】TYPES.— The first clinical evidence of malignancy is  删除换行 induration. The tissue around the growth is hyperaemic. \n\n【67】MACROSCOPIC TYPES — (i) proliferative type, (ii)SKIN AND SUBCUTANEOUS TISSUE 21 删除换行 ulcerative type, (iii) rare plaque-like or (iv) verrucous type. \n\n【68】Ulcerative type is the commonest.\n\n【69】MICROSCOPIC FEATURES.— There are solid  删除换行 columns of epithelial cell which are seen growing down  删除换行 into the dermis, separated from one another by connective  删除换行 tissue. These expand into bulb-like masses, which on  删除换行 section may appear detached. In course of time the cells  删除换行 nearest to the centre being the oldest undergo degenerative  删除换行 changes and converted into a hyaline structureless mass  删除换行 of keratin. This is the process of keratinization. The  删除换行 mass of keratin looks red with eosin stain. This is  删除换行 surrounded by normal-looking squamous cells presenting  删除换行 the characteristic 'prickle-cell' appearance and these are  删除换行 arranged in concentric manner as seen in 'onion skin'. \n\n【70】This whole appearance is called 'cell-nest' or ’epithelial 删除换行 pearl’.\n\n【71】This 'cell-nest' or epithelial pearl' is quite 删除换行 characteristic feature of  删除换行 epidermoid carcinoma, but  删除换行 this may be absent in (i) \n\n【72】rapidly growing tumour  删除换行 and (ii) in mucous  删除换行 membranes e.g. oeso删除8：<u>￾</u>phagus and urinary bladder  删除换行 where cornification is not  删除换行 seen. There is no  删除换行 peripheral palisading as  删除换行 occurs in basal cell  删除换行 carcinoma. The cells may  删除换行 vary from large, well  删除换行 differentiated cells with  删除换行 vesicular nuclei, prominent  删除换行 nucleoli and abundant  删除换行 cytoplasm to completely  删除换行 anaplastic cells with basophilic cytoplasm and numerous  删除换行 mitoses.\n\n【73】Another typical feature of this malignant tumour is  删除换行 infiltration of the dermis by chronic inflammatory cells  删除换行 particularly plasma cells. The tissue around the growth  删除换行 becomes hyperaemic. This is almost always present and  删除换行 this may represent an immune defense reaction against  删除换行 the tumour.\n\n【74】Squamous cell carcinoma is classified histologically into  删除换行 well, moderately and poorly differentiated types. Well  删除换行 differentiated tumours exhibit little anaplasia, few mitoses  删除换行 and abundant evidence of keratinisation such as formation  删除换行 of 'epithelial pearls'. Poorly differentiated tumour is  删除换行 characterised by marked anaplasia, numerous atypical  删除换行 mitoses and minimal or absent keratinisation. Moderately  删除换行 differentiated tumour shows features intermediate between  删除换行 the well and poorly differentiated types.\n\n【75】Verrucous carcinoma — is an uncommon type of  删除换行 squamous cell carcinoma. This is characterised by slow  删除换行 growth, fungating appearance and late deep invasion  删除换行 without metastasis. Histologically, the tumour is very well  删除换行 differentiated and evidence of invasion is almost absent  删除换行 until the lesion is well advanced.\n\n【76】Spread.—\n\n【77】1. Local spread — by continuity and contiguity.\n\n【78】2. Lymph spread occurs by embolism and permeation. \n\n【79】Lymph node involvement varies with the site of the  删除换行 primary lesion. It is late in case of tumours in the  删除换行 hand or from a scar or from chronic ulcer. But it is  删除换行 early seen in cancer of the foot and in cancer of the  删除换行 face and neck.\n\n【80】3. Blood spread occurs very rarely and even if it  删除换行 occurs it takes place in very late stage.\n\n【81】Clinical features.—\n\n【82】HISTORY.—\n\n【83】(i) Age.— Usually this tumour is seen above 40  删除换行 years of age and the incidence increases with the age.\n\n【84】(ii) Occupation.— Cancer of the scrotal skin is  删除换行 common in chimney sweepers and also occurs in engineers  删除换行 whose clothes become soaked in oil. Prolonged exposure  删除换行 to sunlight also causes such lesion.\n\n【85】(iii) Duration.— Usually the swelling is present for  删除换行 one month or few months, as the growth shows variable  删除换行 aggressiveness.\n\n【86】SYMPTOMS.—\n\n【87】(i) A nodule or an ulcer is the main presenting  删除换行 symptom. There may be complain of bleeding which is  删除换行 more common in epithelioma than in basal cell  删除换行 carcinoma.\n\n【88】(ii) The tumour is usually painless. It only  删除换行 becomes painful if it invades deeper structures.\n\n【89】(iii) Sometimes enlarged lymph nodes are the main  删除换行 complaint and the patient may be ignorant of the primary  删除换行 lesion.\n\n【90】LOCAL EXAMINATIONS.—\n\n【91】(i) Sites.— These have been discussed earlier.\n\n【92】(ii) Temperature and tenderness.— The ulcer has  删除换行 a normal temperature and is usually not tender.\n\n【93】(iii) Size and shape.— Squamous carcinoma begins  删除换行 as a small nodule. As they enlarge the centre becomes  删除换行 necrotic and sloughs out. Thus an ulcer develops. Such  删除换行 an ulcer is oval or circular in shape and the size varies  删除换行 extremely.\n\n【94】(iv) Edge.— This carcinoma has raised and  删除换行 everted edge. This shows excessive tissue growth over  删除换行 and above the normal skin surface.\n\n【95】(v) Floor — is covered by necrotic tumour, serum\n删除3：<u>Fig.1.21.— An advanced </u>\n\n【96】stage of squamous cell  删除换行 carcinoma almost involving  删除换行 one half of the face. Everted  删除换行 margin is so well  删除换行 demonstrated in this figure.22 A TEXTBOOK ON SURGICAL SHORT CASES 删除换行 and blood. There may be some granulation tissue but  删除换行 this is pale and unhealthy. Some deeper structures may  删除换行 be exposed, such as muscle, tendon, cartilage or bone.\n\n【97】(vi) Base — of the ulcer is indurated. This is 删除换行 the pathognomonic sign of an epithelioma.\n\n【98】(vii) Mobility.— In early cases epithelioma can be  删除换行 moved with the skin over the underlying structures. Once  删除换行 the tumour has invaded the underlying structures, it  删除换行 cannot be moved. If the tumour has invaded a muscle  删除换行 in the depth, the tumour can be moved with the muscle  删除换行 relaxed. But if the concerned muscle is made taut, the  删除换行 tumour cannot be moved.\n\n【99】(viii) Regional lymph nodes.— This may be enlarged  删除换行 and such examination is highly important. If enlarged, it  删除换行 may not be due to lymph metastasis but may be due to  删除换行 secondary infection. It must be noted that about 1 /3rd  删除换行 cases of such palpable lymph nodes are caused by  删除换行 infection and usually subside after treatment of the  删除换行 primary lesion. But until it is proved otherwise, it should  删除换行 be assumed that the palpable lymph nodes are due to  删除换行 metastasis.\n\n【100】Differential Diagnosis.—\n\n【101】1. Keratoacanthoma.\n\n【102】2. Basal cell carcinoma.\n\n【103】3. Infected seborrhoeic wart.\n\n【104】4. Malignant melanoma.\n\n【105】Treatment can be divided into two 删除换行 groups —\n\n【106】A. Treatment of the primary lesion and B. Treatment  删除换行 of the secondary lymph nodes.\n\n【107】A. Treatment of the primary lesion.—\n\n【108】I. SURGERY.—\n\n【109】Wide excision is the treatment of choice once the  删除换行 diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy. Excision of the growth  删除换行 should be performed with 2 cm of the normal tissue  删除换行 surrounding the tumour. In case of tumour involving  删除换行 finger, toes and penis, amputation is indicated.\n\n【110】Indications.— Surgery is particularly indicated —\n\n【111】(i) When the lesion is of large size.\n\n【112】(ii) When the lesion has involved muscle, cartilage  删除换行 or bone.\n\n【113】(iii) When the facility of radiotherapy is not  删除换行 adequate.\n\n【114】(iv) Recurrence of the growth after radiotherapy.\n\n【115】II. RADIOTHERAPY.—\n\n【116】Superficial radiotherapy will cure 80% of early  删除换行 lesions. Different forms of radiotherapy may be applied  删除换行 when there is adequate facility according to the size and  删除换行 type of the tumour. Such methods are deep X-ray  删除换行 therapy, radium needles and moulds.\n\n【117】Indications.—\n\n【118】(i) When the tumour is poorly differentiated.\n\n【119】(ii) When the condition of the patient is not  删除换行 satisfactory for surgery.\n\n【120】(iii) When the growth is small.\n\n【121】(iv) When the growth has not involved muscles,  删除换行 cartilage or bone or is not close to eyes.\n\n【122】B. Treatment of the secondary lymph nodes.—\n\n【123】(i) When there is no enlarged regional lymph node\n\n【124】— regular follow-up is advised, till the nodes become  删除换行 enlarged and palpable. If the nodes are never enlarged,  删除换行 no treatment should be advised. When the lymph nodes  删除换行 become enlarged and palpable, a biopsy should be  删除换行 performed.

Today, he began to experience twitching of the right upper extremity every 10 minutes, which began mid‐morning. Approximately 30 minutes later, mother administered home rectal diazepam 1 mg to abort the seizures. Despite administration of diazepam, he developed generalized convulsions 15 minutes after administration of diazepam and the mother called the emergency medical services (EMS). EMS providers administered a second dose of diazepam 1 mg without effect. Upon arrival to the children’s emergency department, an intravenous catheter was placed and lorazepam 0.1 mg/kg administered. He received a total of four doses of lorazepam without successful resolution of the seizures, so he was subsequently given a loading dose of phenobarbital. It was noted at this time that he had been having convulsive seizures for 35 minutes. Despite the phenobarbital load, he continued in status epilepticus. He developed respiratory failure with hypotension and required endotracheal intubation and a fluid bolus of 20 mL/kg of isotonic fluid. He was then transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) where he was immediately placed on continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring and care was continued.Past Medical History\n--------------------\n\n【5】He was a term delivery to a 20‐year‐old mother with an uncomplicated pregnancy. However, his delivery was complicated by meconium aspiration and hypoxia with subsequent development of hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. He required a 3‐week stay in the neonatal intensive care unit. A neurology consult was completed and he ultimately required initiation of phenobarbital, clonazepam, and levetiracetam to achieve seizure control. The child continued on this regimen with intermittent adjustments for growth with adequate seizure control until approximately 1 month ago when he developed breakthrough seizures. He is up to date on his immunizations and he has been in close contact with his older sibling who attends daycare and always has URI symptoms.Past Surgical History\n---------------------\n\n【6】Circumcised at birth.Family History\n--------------\n\n【7】Parents are healthy and there is no history of seizures.Current Status\n--------------\n\n【8】On arrival at the PICU, the patient was having subclinical seizures, noted by the neurologist as non‐convulsive refractory status epilepticus on EEG. A propofol infusion is initiated with the goal of burst suppression to abort the seizures. During this time, the patient requires two additional boluses of isotonic fluid 20 mL/kg and a norepinephrine drip to maintain adequate blood pressure. After several titrations of the propofol infusion, cessation of status epilepticus is achieved. A basic metabolic profile and complete blood count are obtained . No meningeal signs or history of fever are noted; lumbar puncture is not completed.

Based on the data described, what are the differential diagnoses and the most likely diagnosis for this child?\n2.  What are the essential pieces of the initial evaluation?\n3.  What is the best way to treat this problem?\n4.  Would you obtain any other diagnostic studies?\n5.  What is the definition of status epilepticus?Rationale and Evidence‐based Practice Explanation\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】### Based on the data described, what are the differential diagnoses and the most likely diagnosis for this child?\n\n【17】When a child presents to the emergency department with prolonged seizures, several differential diagnoses must be considered, including complex febrile seizures, meningitis, encephalitis, traumatic brain injury, syncope, and metabolic disorders. With a history of seizures and the need for three antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), the most likely diagnosis for this child is status epilepticus secondary to his known seizure disorder.\n\n【18】### What are the essential pieces of the initial evaluation?\n\n【19】An initial quick physical examination at presentation should focus and assess respiratory and cardiac status. An adequate airway should be established if there is evidence of respiratory compromise and supportive care must be initiated. Blood and urine studies should be sent for serum glucose (as well as point‐of‐care glucose), serum electrolytes, blood gas and pH, a complete blood count, urine and blood toxicology studies, and serum AED levels. An evidence‐based review found that almost one‐third of children who presented in status epilepticus had drug levels that were subtherapeutic. These findings can impact both management and outcome. Critical laboratory studies should be completed to identify any electrolyte abnormalities and can also reveal metabolic disorders that can present with seizures. Key electrolyte abnormalities that can lead to seizures are hyponatremia, hypoglycemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia. Metabolic studies should be considered if there is suspicion of inborn errors of metabolism and children with these disorders can present with altered mental status and seizures and may have elevated ammonia levels, acidosis, or hypoglycemia. Many children with acute seizures will have elevated blood glucose levels that do not require intervention, but acute hypoglycemia should be treated promptly (except in those patients who are on a ketogenic diet). Brain glucose levels may be lowered with continued seizures, and when hypoxemia is also present brain lactic acidosis and neuronal damage may be worsened.\n\n【20】### What is the best way to treat this problem?\n\n【21】The goal of therapy for status epilepticus is rapid termination of both clinical and electrical seizure activity. Timely cessation of status epilepticus reduces the associated morbidity and mortality. Appropriate treatment may be hindered by therapies aimed only at reduction in seizures rather than cessation, by the use of ineffective therapies such as sedatives and/or paralytics, and by the administration of inadequate doses of anticonvulsant medications. The initial phase for treatment of seizures begins when seizure duration reaches 5 minutes. A benzodiazepine is recommended as the initial therapy of choice. This includes intravenous lorazepam, intramuscular midazolam, and intravenous diazepam as these medications have demonstrated efficacy, safety and tolerability. Although intravenous phenobarbital is an established medication with good tolerability, it is not recommended as first‐line therapy as it requires a slower rate of administration when compared to the benzodiazepines. In the pre‐hospital setting or in situations where the recommended benzodiazepines are not available, rectal diazepam, intranasal midazolam, and buccal midazolam are reasonable therapy options. Initial therapy should consist of single, adequate full doses rather than smaller multiple doses. Intravenous lorazepam and diazepam can both be repeated at full doses if needed.\n删除3：<u>Figure 20.1 EEG.</u>\n\n【22】_Source:_ Courtesy of Jennifer Joiner.\n\n【23】The second phase of therapy begins when seizure duration reaches 20 minutes and ends with cessation of seizures or when seizures last for 40 minutes despite continuation of treatment. In second‐line therapy, fosphenytoin, valproic acid, and levetiracetam are recommended. There is no evidence to support one of these medications being superior to the others. Intravenous phenobarbital is also a reasonable alternative if none of the other recommended second‐line medications are available.\n\n【24】The third phase of seizure treatment begins when seizures have lasted 40 minutes or longer. There is no clear evidence to guide therapy in this phase. When compared with initial therapy, second‐line therapy is not as effective, just as third‐line therapy is also less effective than second‐line therapy. Third‐line treatment choices include repeating second‐line therapy or using anesthetic doses of thiopental, midazolam, pentobarbital, or propofol, with continuous EEG monitoring being recommended for all third‐line therapies. A patient is considered to have refractory epilepsy when seizures continue despite first‐ and second‐line treatments, the seizure has lasted longer than 1 hour, or general anesthesia is required. Throughout all phases of treatment, until the patient returns to baseline, supportive symptomatic care should be provided.\n\n【25】When treating seizures with benzodiazepines and other AEDs, the most common treatment‐related adverse events are respiratory and cardiac depressive symptoms. Cardiac monitoring with frequent vital sign checks should be instituted. In most cases, status epilepticus itself does not cause hypotension; however, many of the medications that are used to treat it do. If hypotension is observed prior to the administration of AEDs, consideration should be given to a possible underlying infectious process, meningitis or sepsis. The rate of respiratory depression in patients with convulsive status epilepticus treated with benzodiazepines is lower than in patients with convulsive status epilepticus treated with placebo, which indicates that respiratory problems are an important consequence of untreated convulsive status epilepticus. Many children will develop hypotension or bradycardia secondary to AED therapy and vasopressor and fluid support will be initiated.\n\n【26】If there is concern for meningitis or other infectious etiology prompting seizure activity, antibiotics should be initiated promptly. Antibiotics should not be held until a lumbar puncture can be performed if there is concern for systemic or central nervous system infection.\n\n【27】### Would you obtain any other diagnostic studies?\n\n【28】There are no other diagnostic studies indicated for this child at this time. To evaluate for diagnoses beyond an etiology of status epilepticus secondary to known seizure disorder, a lumbar puncture could be done to determine meningitis or encephalitis. Neuroimaging is indicated in children for whom status epilepticus is the first presentation of epilepsy as well as in those children who do not follow a typical recovery course after treatment for status epilepticus or if trauma is suspected or known. Computed tomography (CT) can be done quickly and should be performed in patients with concern for infection to evaluate for an intracranial mass or for increased intracranial pressure prior to a lumbar puncture. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has better yield for determining the underlying etiology of seizures and can be done once the patient has been stabilized and seizure control has been achieved.\n\n【29】### What is the definition of status epilepticus?\n\n【30】Brief short seizures are those seizures that last less than 5 minutes, while prolonged seizures are defined as those lasting between 5 and 30 minutes. Status epilepticus is defined as more than 30 minutes of either continuous seizure activity or two or more sequential seizures without full recovery of consciousness between seizures. The 30‐minute definition of status epilepticus is based on the duration of status epilepticus that may potentially lead to permanent neuronal injury. Once a seizure lasts more than 5 minutes, it is likely to become prolonged. Seizure treatment protocols have used a 5‐minute definition to minimize the risk of seizures reaching 30 minutes and the potential adverse events associated with unnecessarily intervening on brief self‐limiting seizures.\n\n【31】Status epilepticus can present in several different forms: convulsive status epilepticus consisting of repeated generalized tonic–clonic seizures with persistent postictal depression of neurological function between seizures; non‐convulsive status epilepticus in which seizures produce a continuous “epileptic twilight” state; or repeated partial seizures that manifest as focal motor signs, focal sensory symptoms, or focal impairment of function that is not associated with altered awareness.Case Resolution\n---------------\n\n【32】The toddler had home medications restarted on hospital day 2 with increase in phenobarbital dosing determined by neurology. Blood cultures were negative at 48 hours and the respiratory viral panel was positive for rhinovirus infection. Blood pressure normalized once the propofol was stopped and he was extubated on hospital day 3. He was discharged home one week after admission with return to baseline mental status.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Understand that the diagnosis of perimenopause is a clinical diagnosis and may include elevated serum FSH and LH levels.

Know that estrogen-replacement therapy is usually effective in treating the hot flushes.\n\n【14】**4\\. Know the risks of continuous estrogen-progestin therapy.**\n\n【15】**Considerations**\n\n【16】This 49-year-old woman complains of irregular menses， feelings of inadequacy， and intermittent sensations of warmth and sweating. This constellation of symptoms is consistent with the perimenopause， or climacteric state. The average age of meno-pause in the United States is 51 years old but can be anywhere from age 40 to58 age range. The majority of women begin to experience the perimenopause for several years before and after the actual menopause. The predominant symptom of hypoestrogenemia is the hot flush. Hot flushes are a vasomotor reaction associ-ated with skin temperature elevation and sweating lasting for 3 to 4 minutes. The low estrogen concentration also has an effect on the vagina by decreasing the epithelial thickness， leading to atrophy and dryness， but she will complain of symptoms long before actual signs are evident on pelvic examination of decreased vaginal rugation and moisture. With these changing levels ofestrogen and progestin during the peri-menopausal years leading up to the actual menopause， the woman will usually expe-rience altered menstrual cycles， with sometimes a skipped menses， a lighter one， or a prolonged one. Elevated serum FSH and LH levels may be helpful. However， these levels will fluctuate in the perimenopause leading up to actual menopause and cannot be relied upon until persistently elevated. The value is determined by the particular reference lab being used but in general is 30 mIU/mL or greater. Saliva testing of estrogen or other levels is not reliable and is expensive. Treatment for 删除换行 hot flushes may include clonidine， gabapentin， selective serotonin reuptake inhibi-tors (SSRIs) medications， or estrogen-replacement therapy with progestin， which is the most effective of the choices. When a woman still has her uterus， the addi-tion of progestin to estrogen replacement is important in preventing endometrial cancer. When estrogen and progestin are used in combination， this is referred to as hormone-replacement therapy (HRT). For a woman who has had a hysterectomy， the estrogen alone is adequate， and is referred to as estrogen-replacement therapy. Until a woman reaches the menopause， treatment for the irregular menstrual cycle may include a progestin or a low-dose oral contraceptive (dependent on her risk factors). This also has the added benefit of providing a back-up method for contra-ception. The choice of therapy depends on a careful review of the patients medi-cal conditions and risk factors for thrombosis， cardiovascular disease， and breast cancer weighed against the severity of the hot flushes. Bioidentical hormones or pharmacy-compounded hormones are not recommended as they are not as closely regulated as FDA-approved medications， and there are no studies that prove their safety or efficacy above standard therapies.\n\n【17】Note： The selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM)， raloxifene， does not treat hot flushes.\n\n【18】**DEFINITIONS**\n\n【19】MENOPAUSE： The point in time in a woman’s life when there is cessation of menses for 12 months due to follicular atresia occurring after age 40 years(mean age 51 years). It describes the final menstrual cycle， but is commonly used to describe the time in a woman’s life after that point.\n\n【20】**PERIMENOPAUSE (CLIMACTERIC)： The transitional few， sometimes several years， spanning from before to 1 year after the menopause. It is characterized in the years leading up to the menopause by irregular menstrual cycles. If hot flushes occur， they usually increase in frequency as menopause is reached. The hot flushing may continue for several years after menopause.**\n\n【21】HOT FLUSHES (FLASHES)： Irregular unpredictable episodes of increased skin temperature and sweating lasting about 3 to 4 minutes caused by vasomo-tor changes. Women often complain of night sweats， another form of hot flushes， which must be differentiated from a disease process or other causes.\n\n【22】PREMATURE OVARIAN FAILURE： The cessation of ovarian function due to atresia of follicles prior to age 40 years. At ages younger than 30 years， autoimmune diseases or karyotypic abnormalities should be considered.\n\n【23】somewhat. Symptoms include irregular menses due to anovulatory cycles， vasomo-tor symptoms such as hot flushes， and decreased estrogen and androgen levels. Because ovarian inhibin levels are decreased，FSH and LH levels rise even before estradiol levels fall. The decreased estradiol concentrations lead to vaginal atrophy， bone loss， and vasomotor symptoms. While most clinicians agree that hormone-replacement therapy is currently the best treatment for the vasomotor symptoms and to prevent osteoporosis， scientific data raises concerns about the risks of this therapy. The Womens Health Initiative Study of continuous estrogen-progestin treatment reported a small but significant increased risk of breast cancer， heart dis-ease，pulmonary embolism， and stroke. The cardiovascular risk was not seen in the women who were in the 50 to 59 age group—those women who were most likely to benefit from beginning HRT in the early menopause years. Women on hormone-replacement therapy had fewer fractures and a lower incidence of colon cancer.\n\n【24】Short-term hormone-replacement therapy (5 years or less) is indicated for vaso-motor symptoms， and should be used for as short a duration as possible in the smallest dose. It is the most effective therapy for relief of symptoms. For women who cannot or choose not to take estrogen， clonidine， or gabapentin may help with the vasomotor symptoms. Another class of pharmaceuticals that may be helpful to relieve the hot flushes is the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. A selective estrogen receptor modulator， such as raloxifene， is helpful in preventing bone loss， but does not alter the hot flushes. Weight-bearing exercise， calcium and vitamin D supplementation， and estrogen replacement are important cornerstones in main-taining bone mass. Because FSH responds to feedback by inhibin， the FSH level cannot be used to titrate the estrogen-replacement dose. In other words， the FSH concentration will still be elevated even though the estrogen replacement may be sufficient.\n\n【25】Other diseases that are important to consider in the perimenopausal woman include hypothyroidism， diabetes mellitus，hypertension，and breast cancer. Women in this stage of life may also experience depression， whether spontaneous in its onset or situational due to grief or midlife adjustments. The practitioner should advocate aerobic exercise at least three times a week， again， with weight-bearing exercise being advantageous for the prevention of osteoporosis. Bone mineral density (BMD) testing， such as by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA)， is useful in the early identification of osteoporosis and osteopenia. BMD testing is indicated for all postmenopausal women aged 65 years or older and postmeno-pausal women at risk for osteoporosis and presenting with a bone fracture. Alcohol abuse may be seen in up to 10% of postmenopausal women， and requires clinical suspicion to establish the diagnosis.\n\n【26】The Stages ofReproductive Aging Workshop (STRAW) research group published a system in 2012 that attempted to predict when women would go into menopause and also characterized the clinical and laboratory changes in the various reproduc-tive stages from adolescence through menopausal transition and into menopause. The next step is to individualize patients based on stage and risk factors into the treatment of these women .

This includes the heart  删除换行 valves, their supporting structures, intraventricular septa and the walls of the heart. Strictly  删除换行 speaking it also includes the endothelium of the intrathoracic great vessels and any intracar删除8：<u>￾</u>diac foreign bodies, such as prosthetic valves or pacemaker wires.\n\n【27】Two factors are necessary for bacterial colonization of a valve to take place:\n\n【28】1. Valvular damage: this can occur from turbulent blood flow, congenital heart  删除换行 disease, prosthetic valves, previous endocarditis, physical manipulation, the  删除换行 particulate material of intravenous drug user’s injections, and degeneration. \n\n【29】Degenerative valves make the incidence of IE three times higher in the elderly  删除换行 population.\n\n【30】2. An inflammatory reaction to the exposed and damaged valvular endothelium  删除换行 results in the deposition of platelets and fibrin. Circulating bacterial colonies grow  删除换行 on these platelet-fibrin clots to form vegetations which are relatively resistant to host  删除换行 immune defences.\n\n【31】In the general population left-sided valves are predominantly affected, most often the mitral  删除换行 valve. Right-sided valve involvement forms less than 10% of IE, and has a lower mortality  删除换行 than left-sided disease. Right-sided IE is more common to cohorts of intravenous drug users,  删除换行 congenital heart disease and in patients with pacemakers.\n\n【32】On account of their resistance to complement and their propensity to adhere to dam删除8：<u>￾</u>aged valvular endothelium, more than 80% of microbes responsible for endocarditis are  删除换行 gram-positive, namely streptococci, staphylococci, and enterococci. Coagulase-negative  删除换行 staphylococci more commonly causes prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE). Native valve  删除换行 endocarditis (NVE) has a mortality of up to 30%, with Staphylococcus aureus infection  删除换行 displaying more pathogenicity than oral streptococci species. PVE has a higher mortality  删除换行 than NVE.\n\n【33】There are underlying risk factors that assist in determining the likely pathogen. Poor den删除8：<u>￾</u>tition, recent dental procedures and other maxillofacial pathology make oral streptococci  删除换行 more likely. Skin lesions, recent trauma or surgery, intravenous drug use or presence of a  删除换行 vascular access device make staphylococci more likely. Bowel and urological pathology, or  删除换行 endocarditis in patients who are severely debilitated and have had multiple courses of broad删除8：<u>￾</u>spectrum antibiotics, makes enterococci more likely. A noteworthy association is Strep. bovis 删除换行 with colon cancer in elderly patients.\n\n【34】A causative organism will be identified in 90% of cases if two separate sets of blood  删除换行 cultures are taken 30 minutes apart. It is imperative to take blood cultures before anti删除8：<u>￾</u>biotics are started, which was not done in this scenario. Antibiotics are the leading cause Case 81: Fever and collapse\n\n【35】删除5：<u>267</u>\nof negative blood  cultures. Other causes of culture-negative endocarditis include the  删除换行 fastidious gram-negative bacteria of the HACEK group (Haemophilus, Aggregatibacter, \n\n【36】Cardiobacterium, Eikenella, Kingella), Coxiella burnetii (Q fever) and Bartonella spp. Each  删除换行 of these three groups is responsible for up to 3% of endocarditis in England and Wales.\n\n【37】All patients with suspected IE must have a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) which  删除换行 detects valvular vegetations with a sensitivity of approximately 70–80%. If this is negative  删除换行 or there is still a high index of clinical suspicion, a transoesophageal echocardiogram (TOE) \n\n【38】is indicated, which has a sensitivity of 90–100%. If a prosthetic valve or intracardiac device  删除换行 is present, a TOE is strongly recommended, as the sensitivity of the TTE is low. A follow-up  删除换行 echocardiogram is required at the end of antibiotic treatment to assess valve and cardiac  删除换行 function.\n\n【39】The mainstay of treatment is a prolonged course of antibiotics. About 50% of patients  删除换行 will require surgical intervention to remove the infected area, as host defences in heart  删除换行 valves are relatively ineffective. Reasons for surgical intervention are divided into 3 broad  删除换行 groups:\n\n【40】1. Uncontrolled infection (not responding to antibiotic therapy, a perivalvular abscess, \n\n【41】PVE, most gram-negative and fungal IE)\n\n【42】2. Prevention of embolism (very large vegetations, signs of emboli)\n\n【43】3. Heart failure or severe valve regurgitation\n\n【44】KEY POINTS\n\n【45】• Infective endocarditis is infection of the inner lining of the heart, the endocardium.\n\n【46】• A causative organism is usually identified if blood cultures are taken before anti删除8：<u>￾</u>biotics are started.\n\n【47】• More than 80% of microbes responsible are gram positive, namely staphylococci,  删除换行 oral streptococci and enterococci.Case 82: Burning sensation when passing urine\n\n【48】删除5：<u>269</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

One day prior to admission， he had gone to a coastal island with his family to fish and grill on the beach. Before setting out on the trip that morning， he had brushed his leg against a canvas tent and lacerated his right mid shin while loading the boat for the trip.\n\n【2】He fished and waded into the water， knee and waist deep， in and out all day. He stayed out on the beach for about 6.5 hours， fishing and grilling with the family. He returned home around 1700 hours， showered， and covered the laceration with Band-Aid， after applying topical bacitracin ointment， and then went out.\n\n【3】He went to bed later， but woke up early the next day around 4.00 am with acute onset of chills and fever， and what he thought was sunburn.\n\n【4】He developed body aches and shakes， and 2 hours later he called the ambu-lance (emergency medical service： EMS) to get him to the hospital ED because he felt he could not drive. By 7.00 am he said the wound appeared dark and that was when he first noted that there was a problem with his leg. At this time he had generalized malaise， diffuse body aches， chills， and fever.\n\n【5】In the ED， the initial complaint was \"sunburn and chills.\" The temperature in the ED quickly rose from 98.2 °F to 101.7°F. He was described as sunburned， crit-ically on his head and shoulders， and was noted to have a laceration to the right calf that was slightly erythematous. The blood pressure dropped from 118/47 to94/44. He received intravenous fluids and ceftriaxone. He was deemed to have sepsis and was quickly worked up and admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU). The initial working diagnosis was \"sepsis and UTI\" (he had hema-turia on admission). The source of infection was unclear， but the leg wound was suspected. Fig. 7.2a shows a photo of the right leg laceration wound and bruise taken in the ED on the day of admission.\n\n【6】The past medical history was significant for degenerative joint disease， coronary artery disease， hypertension， and hyperlipidemia. Atrial fibrillation was noted in 2013； deep vein thrombosis in the right leg and bilateral pulmonary embolus were noted in August， 2010， following left ankle surgery. He was on anticoagulation therapy (rivaroxaban and aspirin) until the admission. The rivaroxaban was held because of the hematuria noted in the ED on admis-sion. Surgical procedures included the following： coronary artery bypass graft\n删除3：<u>Figure 7.2a Photo taken on the day of admission， 6/16/14， 1 day post laceration of right medial mid-distal shin.

He was overweight.\n\n【8】Eight days after admission， on 6/24/14， infectious disease consultation was sought to recommend outpatient antimicrobial and other management. The physical examination on that day showed that the patient was alert and oriented， and in no acute distress. The vital signs were as follows： BP 128/69， P 52， RR 18， temperature 97.4F； height 6'2\"， weight 290 pounds. Head and neck showed seborrheic dermatitis. Heart and lung exam were unremarkable. Abdomen was obese. Lymph nodes were not enlarged. The upper extremities showed a midline catheter in place (right arm)， and a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line in the left upper arm. The right leg below the knee was wrapped up in compression dressing (reassessed later). The skin showed light sunburn on the back， seborrheic dermatitis of the face， and a few ecchymotic changes in the forearms.\n\n【9】_· What likely differential diagnoses would you consider for the sepsis?_\n\n【10】**Hospital course， laboratory， and other parameters**\n\n【11】Blood cultures x2 on admission on 6/16/14were reported positive for gram-negative bacilli， with the initial report of positive culture called 11 hours after blood draw. The right leg wound culture obtained on 6/16/14 was also 删除换行 positive for a gram-negative bacillus. The blister and bruise size of the right leg cellulitis was described by the wound care nurse as 12.5×15×0.2 cm on6/17/14， I day after admission .\n\n【12】Several of the patient's laboratory parameters obtained during the hospital admission are noted in Tables 7.2a，7.2b， and 7.2c. Significant leukocytosis was noted 24 hours after admission (WBC 27.0). Creatine kinase (CK)-MB _Was_ norrmal at 3.2 (normal range 0.5-3.6 ng/mL)， as was the troponin I level. The total creatine phosphokinase (CPK) was only mildly elevated： 446(normal range 26-308 U/L). Venous lactate level was initially elevated (4.5 on6/16/14)， but dropped to normal within 2 days (1.9 on 6/18/14； normal range：0.4-2.0 mmoL/L). Chest x-ray on admission on 6/16/14 was clear.\n\n【13】Twenty-four hours after admission， the WBC count rose to 27.0 (from 8.0 on6/16/14)， and the differential band forms to 17% (from 1.3% on 6/16/14).\n\n【14】The right leg was first surgically debrided on 6/19/14， 3 days after admission. The tissue culture obtained at that time was negative.

The patient was followed at the outpatient wound care cen-ter for several weeks. Split-thickness skin graft of the right leg wound was done on 8/20/14.\n\n【25】_·What is your final diagnosis? What is the likely organism causing this infection?_ The final diagnosis was bacteremia and right leg wound infection， due to Vibrio species. Vibrio species was due to or associated with necrotizing fasciitis and cel-lulitis of the right leg. The infection resulted from laceration of the right leg， the source of entry of the organism. Although the Vibrio was not speciated， it was _most likely Vibrio vulnificus._\n\n【26】**Comments and discussion**\n\n【27】The rapidity of symptom onset in this patient after the leg laceration (18 hours) was a vital clue to the diagnosis. Blood cultures were reported positive within11 hours after blood draw. The gram-negative organism (oxidase positive) grew well in standard media， typical for Vibrio organisms. The Vibrio species isolated in blood and wound was not resistant， but sensitive to all the agents tested. The patient received various antimicrobials， including ceftriaxone and doxycycline， to which the organism was sensitive.\n\n【28】This patient's admission was prolonged， from 6/16 to 6/30/14 (14 days). He was continued on outpatient wound care follow-up for several weeks. Outpatient treatments included UNNA compression wrap of the leg wound as well as wound debridement. Antimicrobial therapy was completed within2-3 weeks after hospital discharge . He had a skin graft for wound closure on8/20/14， about 2 months after the initial admission.\n\n【29】Typically， Vibrio species isolated in our hospital area over the past 15 years have been found to be sensitive to most of the usually available antimicrobials. High resistance would be very unusual. The Vibrio organism isolated in this patient was sensitive to most of the agents tested.\n\n【30】In this patient there was some delay in the initiation of aggressive surgical debridement (3 days) and some delay in the timing of the infectious disease consultation.\n\n【31】**Lessons learned from this case**\n\n【32】General measures that should be applied to patients with Vibrio sepsis or necro-tizing fasciitis would include the following.\n\n【33】· Blood and wound cultures should be done as soon as possible after admission：these were done in this case.\n\n【34】· Rapid institution of antimicrobial therapy is crucial： this was done.\n\n【35】· Early aggressive surgical debridement should be instituted， and done as often as needed： there was delay in the initial aggressive debridement.\n\n【36】· Fluid resuscitation， metabolic， and other support measures should be pursued.\n\n【37】· Aggressive wound care and debridement as needed： prolonged outpatient wound care is typical， as was the case here.\n\n【38】·Some patients may need hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatment (this patient did not have HBO； however， this was not as important as aggressive surgical debridement).\n\n【39】·Most patients with severe necrotizing fasciitis would need skin grafting， typi-cally weeks after admission， as was the case in this patient.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The goal is to focus on functional and skeletal rather than dental correction.\n\n【12】Knowing the diagnosis criteria and which type of cases should be treated early, will permit the clinician to offer the most efficient solution for each individual patient. In general the first phase of treatment in the early mixed dentition has to be followed by a second phase in the permanent dentition.\n\n【13】When and how much growth will occur is unpredictable in some patients, but the direction of growth can be managed (Sureh). However, it is important for the clinician to be able to diagnose and intercept certain developing problems through early treatment.\n\n【14】Many other cases should be supervised, but not treated until the permanent teeth are in place. We must base our decision on a correct diagnosis taking into account that the correction of functional and skeletal imbalances is fundamental before the eruption of all the permanent teeth.\n\n【15】One of the most important advantages to begin the treatment early is to take advantage that in early mixed dentition, the skeletal growth pattern can be modified to a certain point. Other doctors with different protocols suggest that the treatment has to begin after the eruption of the second molars 删除10：<u>(Behrents 2006 )</u>. At this time growth modification will be limited.\n\n【16】Specific indications for early treatment include class II or class III malocclusion, with maxillary midface deficiency anterior and posterior crossbite (unilateral and bilateral), midline discrepancies due to early loss of deciduous teeth with a midline shift, severe anterior open bite, severe deep bite with palatal impingement, finger-sucking habits, crowding resulting in ectopic positioning of permanent teeth, etc. 删除10：<u>(Dugoni 1998 )</u>.\n\n【17】But not all the circumstances are black or white; each patient is unique.\n\n【18】For example, the most appropriate timing for the treatment of class II malocclusion is controversial 删除10：<u>(Cozzani et al. 2013 )</u>. Some clinicians advocate starting a first phase in mixed or temporary dentition, but others prefer to wait until the second molars were erupted.\n\n【19】Also, the timing of treatment interventions can be influenced by the severity of the malocclusion, the age, and maturity of the patient at the time the treatment begins.\n\n【20】It is important to emphasize that different types of brackets and wires were used by the authors to treat the patients since there isn’t a single type of bracket or wire that performs a correct diagnosis in each clinical case, until now.\n\n【21】The role of the orthodontist is to manage the problem in the most efficient way for a better diagnosis. It is fully recognized that some malocclusions are best treated early for biological, functional, and social reasons.\n\n【22】Different alternatives for each malocclusion will be described step by step in each chapter.\n\n【23】It is evident that to design an efficient treatment plan, the clinician must understand the growth and development process very clearly.\n\n【24】It is well known that the difference in the response of patients with the same orthodontic treatment is the result of variability in the direction and rate of craniofacial growth.\n\n【25】It is impossible to decide the best time to begin the treatment based solely on the chronological age since the majority of the malocclusions that have to be treated during mixed dentition are the result of multiple factors.\n\n【26】In general mixed dentition is the best time to start treatment when the correction of habits with or without anterior or lateral transverse crossbite is indicated.\n\n【27】A panoramic radiograph is mandatory at age 8–10 years to confirm the presence or absence of agenesias, supernumerary teeth, cysts, mesiodens, etc.\n\n【28】The last chapter Controversies analyzes the most common ones in depth.\n\n【29】The following examples show the importance of the timing of treatment according to the initial pathology, the direction of growth, and the normalization of the functional problems such as nasal breathing and tongue posture at rest or during swallowing.\n\n【30】Although they were skeletal and dental class III at the beginning of the treatment with a similar biotype, the results that were achieved in the long term were completely different.\n\n【31】The parents of this 6-year-old patient asked for a second opinion about the best time to begin his treatment. They were very interested in having him treated very early and avoid the orthognathic procedure that was suggested. The front photographs confirmed a significant negative overjet and overbite that was present in the anterior region .\n\n【32】From the etiological point of view, it is important to consider that his two older sisters had class I molar and canine, but two of his seven cousins were class III and were treated with orthognathic surgery.\n\n【33】The dental front and lateral photographs showed that the lower incisors were in contact with the upper labial gingival tissues, and, until then and for unknown reasons, he only ate soft meals.\n删除3：<u>Fig. 1.1\n\n【34】( a , b ) Frontal and lateral pretreatment photographs. A significant negative overbite was present\n</u>\nThe lateral radiograph confirmed the negative anterior position of the front teeth. Ricketts analysis demonstrated normal convexity with a retruded upper lip and everted lower lip. An increased facial axis was present (95°), along with a short lower anterior height (41°) .\n删除3：<u>Fig. 1.2\n\n【35】( a , b ) Pretreatment lateral radiograph and Ricketts analysis\n</u>\nThe real question is when would be the best treatment time to begin the correction of this Class III malocclusion? Is it advisable to begin now or to wait until 11–12 or 18 years of age?\n\n【36】There is no doubt that the normalization of the anterior negative crossbite should take place as early as possible since it will help achieve a normal development of the maxilla and to improve the soft tissue profile.\n\n【37】These were the results after 26 months with a functional appliance . Overjet and overbite were improved and midlines were almost normal. The objectives of phase I of treatment were accomplished. It was important to improve the anterior position of the tongue.\n删除3：<u>Fig. 1.3\n\n【38】( a , b ) Frontal and lateral posttreatment photographs at the end of phase I of treatment\n</u>\nHowever, the most important question is if the treatment results will remain stable over the long term.\n\n【39】These were the photos 9 years after treatment. The results were maintained or even improved even though some gingival retractions were seen in the upper canine area .Fortunately, in this particular clinical case, a second phase of treatment was not necessary.\n删除3：<u>Fig. 1.4\n\n【40】( a , b ) Control 9 years after treatment.

It was clear proof that although that early treatment is essential, the type of growth and direction of growth also determine what the result will be. She was only 4 years, 9 months of age. Her dental history showed that her parents were skeletal class III but not her young sister.\n\n【43】The front photographs showed an important dentoalveolar class III with a significant open bite in the anterior region and crossbite in the lateral areas.\n\n【44】As a consequence of the lower and anterior position of the tongue, significant diastemas were present in the lower arch . The normalization of the position of the tongue is one of the most difficult issues and requires a lot of time and effort for the patients and their parents.\n删除3：<u>Fig. 1.6\n\n【45】( a , b ) Frontal and lateral pretreatment photographs. A significant skeletal and dental class III with a considerable open bite was present in this 4-year, 9-month girl\n</u>\nAlthough Ricketts analysis was developed for 9-year-old patients, the lateral radiograph confirmed that the patient had a dental and skeletal open bite – class III with braquifacial biotype. This combination has the poorest long-term prognosis.\n\n【46】It is very important to take into account that patients with class III and open bite are harder to treat than those with class III and deep bite. The normalization of the tongue posture at rest and in function is mandatory to avoid relapse .\n删除3：<u>Fig. 1.7\n\n【47】( a , b ) Lateral radiograph and Ricketts analysis at the beginning of the treatment.

Although most of the treatment objectives were achieved, it would have been better to finish this first phase of treatment with more overjet and overbite, but the patient and her parents decided to conclude this phase for personal reasons. No speech therapy treatment was recorded.\n\n【50】At the end of this first phase, the posterior crossbite was not totally corrected, and midlines were not coincident. The change of color of the right upper central incisor was the result of trauma produced while riding her bicycle .\n删除3：<u>Fig. 1.8\n\n【51】( a , b ) Frontal and lateral photos at the end of this phase of treatment.

The results were totally unexpected.\n\n【53】The clinical photos clearly showed that the open bite in conjunction with class III molar and canine worsened more than expected .\n删除3：<u>Fig. 1.10\n\n【54】( a , b ) Frontal and lateral photographs 5 years without follow-up.

The results clearly showed the adverse direction of growth\n</u>\nThese two clinical cases clearly demonstrated the importance of the normalization of the function and that the possibility to redirect growth is one of the major goals in this phase of treatment.\n\n【56】The difference in the response of patients with a similar orthodontic treatment protocol is the result of variability in the direction and rate of craniofacial growth as it was demonstrated with these two young class III patients.\n\n【57】Integrated diagnosis is the basis that will allow us to determine the best treatment plan while considering the direction and quantity of growth.\n\n【58】It is important to take into consideration that maintaining the results for a long term depends on a number of factors: facial biotype, direction of growth, heredity, control of habits, etc.\n\n【59】The early treatment of the following patient was mandatory not only because of his profile but also due to the position and protrusion of the upper incisors.\n\n【60】The objectives of the first phase of treatment included the normalization of the position and inclination of the upper incisors to prevent any type of dental or dentoalveolar fracture as a consequence of an accident at home or at school. At the same time, the improvement of the position of the lower lip was necessary (Franchi).\n\n【61】The consultation with the otorhinolaryngologist was also mandatory because it was necessary for the patient to be able to breathe without any problems in order to reeducate the position of the lips and the tongue.\n\n【62】The real question is what the best orthodontic treatment approach for this specific patient with prominent upper front teeth is. The answer can vary from the beginning at that time or waiting until all the permanent teeth erupt.\n\n【63】Since one of the treatment objectives was to avoid the fracture of the anterior upper incisors, there is no doubt that the treatment had to begin at that moment.\n\n【64】A consultation with the otorhinolaryngologist was fundamental since the patient had to learn how to start breathing through his nose.\n\n【65】Before selecting the best treatment plan for this patient, it was necessary to determine which type of class II he had.\n\n【66】Without knowing the etiology, it is very difficult to determine the correct, individualized treatment plan.\n\n【67】It is well known that functional matrix facilitates the lower third development in the three directions; thus, in early mixed dentition, the normalization of habits is fundamental to facilitate tooth eruption in normal position.\n\n【68】To complete the diagnosis protocol, the patient was sent to his pediatrician because he snored loudly at night. He had a convex profile with a closed nasolabial angle in conjunction with difficulties to close his mouth. Also, he had some respiratory problems along with thumb-sucking and lower lip interposition .\n删除3：<u>Fig. 1.12\n\n【69】( a , b ) Frontal and lateral facial pretreatment photographs. Difficulties in closing his mouth were clearly visible\n</u>\nIn order to determine the best and most efficient treatment protocol, it is necessary to consider if it is only an anteroposterior problem or if it is combined with a transversal one. In this situation, it is highly recommendable to treat the transversal discrepancy first 删除10：<u>(Subtelny 2000 )</u>. Also, it is advisable to restrain the forward displacement of the maxillary dentition and its alveolar process and at the same time allow the normal development of the mandible.\n\n【70】As a consequence of all the functional problems, the mandibular dentition was retro-positioned with retroinclined mandibular incisors and total lack of space for the lower left canine .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Both the incisions  删除换行 are closed with or without drainage. During dissection one  删除换行 must be careful, as many important nerves and blood vessels,  删除换行 which have been discussed earlier, are around.\n\n【25】Complete removal is necessary to avoid recurrence.\n\n【26】BRANCHIAL FISTULA\n\n【27】This is a rare tumour which arises from the remnant of  删除换行 the branchial cleft. This is a deep-seated carcinoma with no  删除换行 other primary tumour ever discovered. As a matter of fact a  删除换行 clinical diagnosis of branchiogenic carcinoma is rarely justified  删除换行 until and unless one very clearly excludes primary growth in  删除换行 the mouth, tongue, pharynx, larynx and external auditory  删除换行 meatus. Again at times a primary carcinoma of the mouth  删除换行 or pharynx may remain silent for months, the only evidence  删除换行 of its presence being a deep-seated cervical lymph node.\n\n【28】This carcinoma is commoner in males and is situated  删除换行 deep in the neck near the bifurcation of the common carotid  删除换行 artery. It infiltrates the surrounding structures and  删除换行 metastasises to the regional lymph nodes. Microscopically, 删除换行 the tumour consists of squamous or transitional cells arranged  删除换行 in masses, in the centre of which cavities may appear due to  删除换行 necrosis. Lymphoid tissue may be seen here and there, as is  删除换行 seen in a branchial cyst.\n\n【29】PHARYNX\n\n【30】It is a cystic swelling which contains multiple locules of  删除换行 clear lymph.\n\n【31】SKIN\n\n【32】In human embryo at about the 6th week the lymph sacs  删除换行 develop six in number from which the lymph vessels are  删除换行 derived. One pair in the neck called jugular lymph sacs  删除换行 develop near the origin of the internal jugular vein. One at  删除换行 the retroperitoneal tissue and another lymph sac is called  删除换行 cysterna chyli. Another pair develops near the inguinal region  删除换行 below the bifurcation of the common iliac vein. This pair is  删除换行 called posterior lymph sac.\n\n【33】The jugular lymph sac is first to appear at the junction  删除换行 of the subclavian vein with the anterior cardinal vein which  删除换行 ultimately forms the jugular vein. Sequestration of a portion  删除换行 of the jugular sac from the lymphatic system which fails to 删除换行 join the regular lymphatic system accounts for the appearance  删除换行 of cystic hygroma.\n\n【34】Pathology.—\n\n【35】The swelling consists of aggregation of cysts which  删除换行 contain clear lymph. It can be considered as a multilocular  删除换行 swelling containing clear lymph. Each locule is lined by a  删除换行 single layer of endothelium. That is why this swelling is a  删除换行 brilliantly translucent swelling. Many locules or cysts may  删除换行 intercommunicate with one another. Cystic hygroma may  删除换行 infiltrate into the muscle planes and these extensions may  删除换行 grow deep.\n\n【36】Sites of cystic hygroma.—\n\n【37】(i) Posterior triangle of the neck is the commonest site. \n\n【38】The swelling gradually extends upwards towards the ear or  删除换行 downwards towards the axilla. The swelling may attain such  删除换行 a huge size that it becomes difficult to know which, is the  删除换行 actual site of origin. In a few textbooks it is described as an  删除换行 anterior triangle swelling.\n\n【39】(ii) In the cheek.\n\n【40】(iii) In axilla.删除5：<u> 1</u>\n(iv) In the groin. J Very rare.\n\n【41】(v) In the mediastinum.\n\n【42】These sites should be carefully looked for such swelling.\n删除3：<u>Fig. 8.6.— Cystic hygroma on the right side of the neck of a baby.</u>\n\n【43】Diagnosis.— .\n\n【44】Age.— It is the earliest swelling one can see in the neck. \n\n【45】It manifests in early infancy. Occasionally it is present at  删除换行 birth. Rarely it may be present before birth and if attains a  删除换行 large size may obstruct labour.\n\n【46】FISTULOUS\n\n【47】TRACK\n\n【48】The only complaint is the lump or swelling. The parents  删除换行 bring the children for disfigurement.\n\n【49】BRANCHIOGENIC CARCINOMA\n\n【50】(i) Site.— Its usual position is at the lower third of the  删除换行 neck in the posterior triangle.SWELLINGS IN THE NECK 105\n\n【51】(ii) Size and shape.— The size varies extremely. It is  删除换行 usually round in shape with smooth indistinct margin which  删除换行 yields to the palpating finger.\n\n【52】(iii) Surface.— Surface is smooth or lobulated. When  删除换行 multiple cysts or locula remain very near the surface, it may  删除换行 be lobulated. Usually large cyst remains towards the surface  删除换行 and gives a smooth surface.\n\n【53】(iv) Consistency.— It is extremely soft and cystic and  删除换行 fluctuation test is positive.\n\n【54】(v) Impulse on coughing.— This swelling gives an  删除换行 impulse on coughing. When the child coughs or cries the  删除换行 swelling visibly increases in size.\n删除3：<u>Fig. 8.7.— Cystic hygroma of a baby shown from behind.</u>\n\n【55】(vi) Compressibility.— The swelling is partially  删除换行 compressible, as the fluid in one loculus passes into the others. \n\n【56】But this cannot be reduced.\n\n【57】(vii) Translucency test.— It is a brilliantly translucent  删除换行 swelling and this is important for differential diagnosis. \n\n【58】During this test multiple septi may be noticed.\n\n【59】(viii) Regional lymph nodes are not enlarged.\n\n【60】Complications.—\n\n【61】(i) Sometimes the growth is extremely rapid and may  删除换行 cause respiratory difficulty. In this case immediate aspiration  删除换行 of as much content as possible is necessary. Tracheostomy  删除换行 may be required if this does not relieve respiratory difficulty.\n\n【62】(ii) Swelling may become infected as a result of  删除换行 nasopharyngeal infection.\n\n【63】(iii) Spontaneous recovery may take place particularly  删除换行 when the swelling becomes inflamed. Subsequent fibrosis  删除换行 will help spontaneous regression.\n\n【64】Treatment.—\n\n【65】Excision is the treatment of choice. Such excision may be  删除换行 delayed under strict follow-up till the child attains a  删除换行 reasonable age for excision.\n\n【66】Preliminary injection of boiling water into the cyst at  删除换行 weekly interval will cause regression of the swelling to a certain  删除换行 extent. The cyst wall becomes more fibrous. This should be  删除换行 followed by excision of the cyst. Preliminary injection will  删除换行 facilitate dissection. One must be careful to excise all the  删除换行 extensions through the muscle planes.\n\n【67】Dangers of incomplete removal.— (i) It may cause  删除换行 recurrence.\n\n【68】(ii) Continuous fluid and electrolyte loss through the  删除换行 open cysts will cause dehydration of the child.\n\n【69】(iii) It may lead to wound infection.\n\n【70】Radiotherapy may be tried in case of recurrence and when  删除换行 surgery is not possible. This swelling is redioresistant and  删除换行 hardly acts to radiotherapy.\n\n【71】CYSTIC HYGROMA\n\n【72】It is a cystic swelling developed in the remnant of the  删除换行 thyroglossal tract.\n\n【73】Development.—\n\n【74】From the ventral portion of the entoderm between the  删除换行 first and second branchial arch, a diverticulum extends  删除换行 downwards and forms the median thyroid diverticulum. This  删除换行 diverticulum moves downwards and comes in front of the  删除换行 thyroid cartilage to form the isthmus and pyramidal lobe of  删除换行 the thyroid gland. This tract is known as thyroglossal tract. \n\n【75】The hyoid bone which is developed from the second and  删除换行 third branchial arches come in very close relation with this  删除换行 tract. The entoderm from where the tract or the thyroglossal  删除换行 duct started ultimately forms the foramen caecum of the  删除换行 tongue.\n\n【76】The course of the thyroglossal tract or duct.— The thyroglossal  删除换行 duct passes down from the foramen caecum of the tongue  删除换行 between the genioglossi muscles. Then it passes along the  删除换行 midline downwards. It descends either in front of the hyoid  删除换行 bone or through the hyoid bone or it hooks below and behind  删除换行 the hyoid bone and then descends downwards along the  删除换行 midline to the upper border of the thyroid cartilage. It then  删除换行 moves slightly to the left and ultimately ends- in the  删除换行 pyramidal lobe of the thyroid gland.\n\n【77】Ultimate fate of the thyroglossal duct.—\n\n【78】(i) From the origin of the duct in the foramen caecum  删除换行 ectopic thyroid tissue may develop and form lingual thyroid.\n\n【79】This lingual thyroid is a red rounded swelling at the back of  删除换行 the tongue at the foramen caecum. It may represent the  删除换行 only thyroid tissue present.\n\n【80】(ii) The entire duct usually disappears except the lower  删除换行 portion which forms the isthmus of the thyroid gland and  删除换行 the pyramidal lobe.\n\n【81】(iii) The upper portion of the duct from the foramen  删除换行 caecum to the hyoid bone may disappear but the rest of the  删除换行 duct or tract persists as the levator glandulae thyroidae.106 A TEXTBOOK ON SURGICAL SHORT CASES\n\n【82】(iv) While the tract disappears, a portion of the duct  删除换行 may remain patent which gives rise to a cystic swelling due  删除换行 to accumulation of secretion and this is known as thyroglossal 删除换行 cyst. This is an example of tubulodermoid.\n\n【83】(v) An ectopic thyroid may occupy subhyoid position in  删除换行 the midline and simulate a thyroglossal cyst. It may be the  删除换行 only thyroid tissue present in the body.\n\n【84】Anterior\n\n【85】Hyoid bone\n\n【86】Thyroglossal duct\n\n【87】Figs.8.8. & 8.9.— Demonstrate the course of the thyroglossal  删除换行 duct.

In Fig. \n\n【88】8.9 the lateral view of the duct shows how it curves posterior to the  删除换行 hyoid bone.\n\n【89】Pathology-—\n\n【90】The thyroglossal cyst is lined by pseudostratified ciliated  删除换行 columnar epithelium. There may be squamous lining and  删除换行 mucous glands. There may be some lymphoid tissue outside  删除换行 the epithelial lining, for which this cyst is prone to become  删除换行 infected. It may contain thyroid tissue. The contents are  删除换行 usually mucoid and become thickened by desquamated  删除换行 epithelial cells or debris.

The differential  删除换行 diagnosis is extensive and includes cancer, depression, anaemia, renal failure and endocrine  删除换行 diseases. In this case the main differential diagnoses are depression and hypothyroidism. \n\n【26】He has a history of depression but currently has no obvious triggers for a further episode of  删除换行 depression. He is not waking early in the morning or having difficulty getting to sleep, which  删除换行 are common biological symptoms of severe depression. There are a number of clues in this  删除换行 case to the diagnosis of hypothyroidism. Insidious onset of fatigue, difficulty concentrating,  删除换行 increased somnolence, constipation and weight gain are features of hypothyroidism. As in  删除换行 this case there may be a family or past medical history of other autoimmune diseases such  删除换行 as type 1 diabetes mellitus, vitiligo or Addison’s disease. Hypothyroidism typically pres删除8：<u>￾</u>ents in the fifth or sixth decade and is about five times more common in women than men. \n\n【27】Obstructive sleep apnoea is associated with hypothyroidism and may contribute to daytime  删除换行 sleepiness and fatigue.\n\n【28】On examination the facial appearances and bradycardia are consistent with the diagnosis. \n\n【29】Characteristically, patients with overt hypothyroidism have dry, scaly, cold and thickened  删除换行 skin. There may be a malar flush against the background of the pale facial appearance (‘straw删除8：<u>￾</u>berries-and-cream appearance’). Scalp hair is usually brittle and sparse, and there may be  删除换行 thinning of the lateral third of the eyebrows. Bradycardia may occur, and the apex beat may  删除换行 be difficult to locate because of the presence of a pericardial effusion. A classic sign of hypo删除8：<u>￾</u>thyroidism is the delayed relaxation phase of the ankle jerk. Other neurological syndromes  删除换行 that may occur in association with hypothyroidism include carpal tunnel syndrome, proxi删除8：<u>￾</u>mal muscle weakness, a cerebellar syndrome or polyneuritis. Patients may present with psy删除8：<u>￾</u>chiatric illnesses, including psychoses (‘myxoedema madness’).\n\n【30】Clues to the diagnosis in the investigations are the mild normochromic, normocytic anae删除8：<u>￾</u>mia, marginally raised creatinine, and hypercholesterolaemia. The anaemia of hypothyroid删除8：<u>￾</u>ism is typically normochromic, normocytic or macrocytic; microcytic anaemia may occur  删除换行 if there is menorrhagia. A macrocytic anaemia may represent undiagnosed vitamin B12 defi删除8：<u>￾</u>ciency. Renal blood flow is reduced in hypothyroidism, and this can cause the creatinine to  删除换行 be slightly above the normal range.\n\n【31】The most severe cases of hypothyroidism present with myxoedema coma, with bradycardia,  删除换行 reduced respiratory rate and severe hypothermia. Typically, shivering is absent.\n\n【32】In this case the thyroid function tests showed thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), 73mU/L \n\n【33】(normal range <6mU/L); free thyroxine (T4), 3pmol/L (normal range 9–22pmol/L). The high \n\n【34】TSH indicates primary hypothyroidism rather than hypopituitarism. The commonest cause  删除换行 of hypothyroidism is autoimmune thyroiditis, and the patient should have thyroid autoanti删除8：<u>￾</u>bodies assayed.Case 21: Tiredness\n\n【35】删除5：<u>59</u>\n!

The Rb protein binds and sequesters transcription factors of the E2F family to prevent the G1-to-S phase transition. Loss of Rb thus promotes deregulation of this transition and increased growth.\n\n【12】**What is the \"two-hit hypothesis\"?**\n\n【13】The two-hit hypothesis (Knudsen hypothesis) suggests that two separate mutations are required for tumorigenesis involving a suppressor gene. In heritable disease， patients inherit a mutated germline allele from a parent and acquire a second somatic mutation later in development. This often causes binocular and multifocal disease. In noninherited disease， two spontaneous mutations arise in a single retinal cell during development， causing uniocular， unifocal disease.\n\n【14】**What secondary malignancies is this patient at risk of developing?**\n\n【15】Osteogenic sarcoma， soft tissue sarcoma， and malignant melanoma commonly develop in patients with retinoblastoma.

Consequently, topical clobetasol 0.05 % ointment (up to 300 g/day) and oral prednisolone (2 mg/kg) were initiated and after 1 week increased to 2.25 mg/kg. Two additional cycles of immunoadsorption and IVIG were given at 3 week intervals . After 5 weeks the patient was discharged from ICU to the dermatology ward and mucocutaneous lesions started to improve allowing the cessation of treatment with topical corticosteroids steroids and tapering of the oral prednisolone dose. IVIG was further administered on a monthly basis while mycophenolate mofetil had to be reduced and later omitted due to increasing pancytopenia that was finally attributed to cytomegalovirus reactivation. Systemic antiviral therapy with valganciclovir for 8 weeks led to disappearance of the virus load. Ongoing bacteremia and systemic Candida infections required repeated systemic antimicrobial and antifungal therapy. Severe hyperkalaemia due to adrenal gland suppression was managed on ICU for few days. Since mucocutaneous lesions only healed slowly rituximab 1 g was given. However, the patient could be mobilized following intensive physiotherapy and was discharged to a rehabilitation hospital after nearly 6 months in our clinic with hydrocortisone 30 mg/day.

Prior to the advent of systemic corticosteroids, the mortality associated with pemphigus vulgaris was up to 80 %. Today, a significant part of the associated mortality could be considered iatrogenic, i.e. related to side-effects of immunosuppressive therapy as illustrated by our case vignette. Pemphigus vulgaris most commonly develops during the fifth to seventh decades of life. Cutaneous lesions present as blisters and erosions on normal or erythematous skin. The oral mucosa is the initial site of involvement in the majority of cases and the clinical manifestations may indeed remain confined to the mucosal surfaces. However, in other cases skin changes may become more generalized. Diagnosis is based on the clinical manifestations combined with characteristic histological changes seen in lesional skin or mucosal biopsies, direct immunofluorescence microscopy of a perilesional biopsy, and the detection of serum anti-desmoglein 3 autoantibodies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【37】Therapeutic strategies rely on the use of systemic corticosteroids (prednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/day or i.v. dexamethasone pulses) in conjunction with other immunosuppressant agents such as azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil or cyclophosphamide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Rituximab (monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody), immunoadsorption und IVIG can be used in the treatment of refractory pemphigus vulgaris 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 – 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【38】The presented case demonstrates that pemphigus vulgaris remains a potentially life-threatening disease. Treatment is limited by the range of serious side-effects associated with the current immunosuppressive therapy. Moreover, patients require well co-ordinated multi-disciplinary support, often in a tertiary referral center that has extensive expertise in the diagnosis and management of such a rare disease. Only the constant interaction between dermatologists, infectiologists, microbiologists, pharmacologists, nephrologists, anaesthiologists, nurses, and physiotherapists has enabled us to successfully manage this severely affected patient. Ultimately, the lack of randomized controlled trials in the management of pemphigus vulgaris 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u> means that the choice of therapeutic regimen depends on several factors, including the patient’s general medical condition, disease activity, treatment history and side-effect profile.\n\n【39】Key Points\n----------\n\n【40】*   Pemphigus vulgaris is a potentially fatal autoimmune blistering disease characterized by erosions of mucous membranes and/or erosions and blisters of the skin.\n\n【41】*   In pemphigus vulgaris, antibodies are directed against structural proteins of the epidermal desmosome, desmoglein 3, and in patients with skin involvement also desmoglein 1.\n\n【42】*   Systemic corticosteroids are the therapeutic backbone of pemphigus vulgaris usually combined with additional immunosuppressants.

The most useful investigation would be to send gastric washings on 3 consecutive mornings for microscopy for acid and alkaline fast bacilli (AAFB) and a culture of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis， in order to confirm a microbiological diagnosis of TB infection.\n\n【28】The key point in this case is to differentiate between latent and active TB infection， as this will determine the type and duration of treatment given.

He has developed severe pain over the medial aspect of his right elbow  删除换行 which is limiting his ability to work, so he visits his general practitioner. He reports that  删除换行 this is not the first time this pain has occurred. \n\n【3】Examination\n\n【4】This young man’s pain is localized to the medial epicondyle of his right elbow. He has  删除换行 tenderness to palpation over the anterior aspect of the medial epicondyle. There is no  删除换行 obvious swelling or deformity of the elbow and no muscle wasting. Elbow range of  删除换行 movement and neurovascular examination are normal. Pain over the medial epicondyle  删除换行 is aggravated with resisted wrist flexion and pronation.\n\n【5】Questions\n\n【6】• What is the diagnosis?\n\n【7】• What further examinations and investigations are commonly undertaken in this  删除换行 condition?\n\n【8】• What are the management options?删除5：<u>128</u>\n删除7：<u>100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology</u>\nANSWER 46\n\n【9】The diagnosis is medial epicondylitis (commonly called ‘golfer’s elbow’). It typically  删除换行 presents with pain on the medial aspect of the elbow associated with an exacerbation  删除换行 of pain in resisted wrist flexion. This condition was first described in 1882 by Henry J. \n\n【10】Morris and is classified as an overuse syndrome. The flexor carpi radialis and the prona删除8：<u>￾</u>tor teres are commonly involved at the insertion of the medial epicondyle; the muscles  删除换行 less commonly involved are the palmaris longus, the flexor digitorum superficialis, and  删除换行 the flexor carpi ulnaris.\n\n【11】This condition is seen most commonly in sports involving repetitive valgus stress, flexion  删除换行 and pronation, such as occurs in golf and baseball. Ulnar neuropathy may be associ删除8：<u>￾</u>ated in approximately half of cases. Magnetic resonance images and histology show the  删除换行 presence of micro-tears in the flexor–pronator tendons without inflammation. Medial  删除换行 epicondylitis is more common in men and the peak incidences are in the third and fifth  删除换行 decades of life.\n\n【12】X-rays of the affected elbow are usually normal but can show calcification at the affected  删除换行 tendon’s origin. MRI is sensitive and specific in the evaluation of medial epicondyli删除8：<u>￾</u>tis. This modality allows assessment of the tendons, ulnar nerve and medial collateral  删除换行 ligament. For confirmation of the diagnosis, a local anaesthetic can be injected into the  删除换行 medial epicondyle over the area of maximal tenderness; complete relief of pain should  删除换行 be expected.\n\n【13】In the majority of cases, conservative management works and should be the initial treat删除8：<u>￾</u>ment. The first step is to identify and restrict the activities that cause the pain. Changes  删除换行 in working conditions or sporting activities can help. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory  删除换行 drugs (NSAIDs), physical therapy and an epicondylar band over the forearm muscles to  删除换行 reduce force transmission to the tendons are helpful. Return to regular activities should be  删除换行 progressive to minimize the chances of recurrence. Steroid infiltration can be considered  删除换行 after failed conservative management. Surgery is considered if conservative measures  删除换行 fail after 6–12 months. It involves release of the muscle group origin from the tendon.\n\n【14】KEY POINTS\n\n【15】• Flexor carpi radialis and the pronator teres are commonly involved in golfer’s elbow.\n\n【16】• The mechanism is through repetitive valgus stress, flexion and pronation.\n\n【17】• X-rays are usually normal.

Fungal infection of the nail is found in up to 14 % of the population. Common risk factors include nail trauma, HIV infection, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease. Around 30–40 % of the patients with nail fungus infection also have a concomitant fungal infection of the skin, particularly of the foot. The two most common toenail dermatophytes involved are T. rubum and T. interdigitate which account for 90 % of all cases. Yeast and molds account for the remaining 10 %.

It is effective against metastatic colorectal and head/neck cancers because EGFR is typically overexpressed in these tumors 删除10：<u>(Bonner 2010 )</u>. Most EGFR inhibitors cause adverse cutaneous reactions with the most frequently reported being acneiform eruption: follicular based macules, papules, or pustules 删除10：<u>(Tomková et al. 2010 )</u>. It should be noted that the rash is not a drug hypersensitivity; therefore, it is not an ­indication to discontinue treatment 删除10：<u>(Lynch et al. 2007 )</u>. Other skin related side effects of cetuximab include eczema, hyperpigmentation, conjunctivitis, telangiectasias, fissures, desquamation, paranoychia, xerosis, and destruction of both hair and nails 删除10：<u>(DeWitt et al. 2007 )</u>.\n\n【25】EGFR is expressed in the epidermis and hair follicles receptor antagonism therefore disrupts proliferation and differentiation causing abnormal alterations in skin structures and the release of inflammatory mediators 删除10：<u>(Lenz 2006 )</u>.\n\n【26】There is some controversy about acneiform reactions predicting antitumor effect. For example, Tomková et al. found no relationship between the severity of the acneiform rash and the patient’s cancer outcome. However, Bonner et al. reported that patients with severe cetuximab-induced rashes, there was a better 5-year survival rate than patients with mild or no rashes at all.\n\n【27】Biopsy of the acneiform rash typically displays characteristic perifollicular lymphoneutrophilic infiltrate within the epidermis and adnexal structures.\n\n【28】Drug cessation or even dosage reduction is typically not needed. Several studies have demonstrated the success traditional acne treatments in treating the eruption, such as topical adapalene, oral isotretinoin, oral tetracyclines, emollients, and topical antibiotics. Some institutions use minocycline prophylactically and during cetuximab therapy 删除10：<u>(Boggs 2007 ; Dancey 2003 )</u>. It is unknown whether treating the acneiform eruption modulates the chemotherapeutic tumor response.\n\n【29】Key Points\n----------\n\n【30】*   Acneiform eruption can occur with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors, which are chemotherapeutic agents used in metastatic gastrointestinal and otolaryngological tumors.\n\n【31】*   The presence of acneiform eruption during EGFR treatment might predict tumor response, although this is controversial.\n\n【32】*   It is unknown whether treating the acneiform interferes with EGFR chemotherapeutic effect. Nonetheless, some institutions advocate for prophylactic acne treatment during EGFR treatment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

This woman is in the secretory (also called luteal) phase of her menstrual cycle, which occurs after ovulation (approximately day 14 of a typical menstrual cycle) through the end of the cycle. Progesterone increases after ovulation (as it is produced by the corpus luteum) and usually peaks around day 21-22. Progesterone is responsible for the increased glandular production of glycogen and the differentiation and maintenance of the endometrium. The estrogen level is high just prior to ovulation (it induces the LH peak), but falls dramatically around the time of ovulation (when the follicle becomes the corpus luteum). After ovulation the estrogen levels begin to rise again, returning to a relative peak during the luteal phase (around day 21). The high levels of estrogen and progesterone act in negative feedback during the luteal phase, inhibiting the release of FSH and LH. Thus during the secretory phase, progesterone and estrogen levels are high and FSH and LH levels are low due to negative feedback.  \n\n【7】Answer A is incorrect. This combination of hormone changes is seen during the end of the menstrual cycle, when the corpus luteum degenerates. Decreasing progesterone levels initiate the menstrual phase in the endometrium, while low levels of estrogen disinhibit FSH release (ie, a negative feedback mechanism), which is required for the recruitment of follicles to begin a new cycle.  \n\n【8】Answer B is incorrect. This combination is characteristic of the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, during which estrogen increases slowly due to the maturation of the follicle(s) under the influence of FSH. Estrogen inhibits further FSH release, ultimately allowing a single follicle to develop fully. During this time, progesterone levels are low and stable due to the lack of a corpus luteum, which is responsible for secretion of the hormone later in the cycle.  \n\n【9】Answer C is incorrect. This combination predominates in the days prior to ovulation. During this time, the now mature and sizable ovarian follicle secretes a burst of estrogen that stimulates LH (and FSH) release from the anterior pituitary; thus the feedback mechanism of estrogen on the anterior pituitary is positive, a reversal of the negative feedback relationship that occurred during the earlier parts of the follicular phase. Progesterone levels remain low and stable, due to the lack of a corpus luteum, which is responsible for the secretion of the hormone later in the cycle.  \n\n【10】Answer D is incorrect. This combination of hormone changes is seen immediately following ovulation, when estrogen levels are decreasing (prior to increasing again during the luteal phase) and progesterone levels are increasing (since the hormone is secreted by the newly formed corpus luteum). FSH and LH levels are decreasing at this time due to the negative feedback exerted by estrogen and progesterone on their release.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

An early and accurate diagnosis is the most important issue, no matter the number of phases that the patient requires to achieve the best result in a more conservative manner with fewer orthognathic procedures.\n\n【21】Another malocclusion that has to be treated very early is the anterior deep bite since the musculature plays an important role before, during, and after treatment during the long retention period. The early treatment protocol to correct the anterior deep bite can be divided in three big groups: intrusion of the anterior teeth, extrusion of the posterior ones, or a combination of both.\n\n【22】To design the best treatment plan, a careful analysis of the smile at rest and during function is fundamental.

Her mother, a well-known odontopediatric, was very disappointed since her daughter never used any removable functional appliances in order to correct the considerable anterior deep bite.\n\n【24】The front photograph confirmed an overbite of 100% in the central incisor region that was confirmed in the lateral radiograph.

Phase 1 was very important since the adaptation of the musculature system is very predictable. It is possible that a second phase of treatment would be necessary when all the permanent teeth erupted. Although a significant posterior extrusion was performed, the midlines were stable .\n\n【31】The key was that the patient uses this “fixed functional appliance” 24 h a day, and in this way, the whole stomatologic system would adapt to the new vertical dimension, and a normal functional occlusion would be achieved.

It is important to emphasize that different types of brackets and wires were used since there is no intelligent bracket that performs a correct diagnosis in each patient, until now.\n\n【36】The early normalization of the neuromuscular behavior is more important than simply the position of some teeth and as a result early treatment has a real advantage to avoid adverse effects.\n\n【37】The role of the orthodontist is to manage in the most efficient way for a better diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, and retention plan.\n\n【38】It was totally demonstrated that there is not one appliance that fits all the patients even with a similar age and malocclusion.\n\n【39】In general the treatment plan was divided into one, two, or more phases: the first phase has to be undertaken only on the primary teeth or early mixed dentition to correct habits and alleviate functional problems before the second or third phase of treatment with fixed appliances in the permanent dentition.\n\n【40】The key question is diagnosis, timing, and efficacy of treatment.\n\n【41】The selection of the best therapy has to be based on available evidence.\n\n【42】It is important to remember that early treatment phase cannot avoid a second phase of treatment but does reduce its length and complications.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

High删除8：<u>￾</u>resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is an obligatory tool to diagnose this syndrome. \n\n【12】CPFE is commonly complicated by pulmonary hypertension, acute lung injury, and  删除换行 lung cancer which suggests poor prognosis. Other than lung transplantation, there is删除7：<u> 100 Cases in Pulmonary Medicine A Case of Combined Pulmonary Fibrosis and Emphysema 359</u>\nlittle to no treatment or less effective treatment for CPFE patients with severe pulmonary  删除换行 hypertension.\n\n【13】When pulmonary function tests (PFTs) demonstrate normal or near-normal  删除换行 spirometry and lung volumes but a severely diminished diffusing capacity of lung for  删除换行 carbon monoxide (DLCO), the diagnosis of the CPFE syndrome should be taken into  删除换行 consideration in such settings especially in a current or former smoker. In a retrospective  删除换行 review of patients with severe abnormalities in gas exchange on PFTs, defined as a carbon  删除换行 monoxide transfer coefficient, of 40% predicted, 16% had CPFE while remaining had  删除换行 emphysema, interstitial lung disease, or pulmonary arterial hypertension. These PFT  删除换行 patterns should raise suspicion for CPFE syndrome but may also be explained by other  删除换行 abnormalities such as pulmonary vascular disease, emphysema, and some forms of  删除换行 interstitial lung disease.CPFE also has been recognized in the lung cancer population,  删除换行 being present in 101 of 1,143 (8.9%) consecutive patients with lung cancer in a study  删除换行 by Usui et al. Diagnosis of CPFE should be considered in those patients with severe  删除换行 breathlessness and normal or near-normal spirometry and those with oxygen require删除8：<u>￾</u>ments out of proportion to spirometric abnormalities as in this case. In such cases, full \n\n【14】PFTs and HRCT thorax can establish the presence of CPFE syndrome. Characteristic  删除换行 radiologic findings in the CPFE syndrome include upper-lobe emphysema and lower删除8：<u>￾</u>lobe interstitial fibrotic changes. The emphysema in CPFE comprises bullous, paraseptal,  删除换行 and centrilobular changes and is characteristically distributed in the upper lobes. \n\n【15】Honeycombing and reticular abnormalities are frequent but areas of ground glass  删除换行 attenuation can be seen in most patients. Occasionally, ground glass attenuation is the  删除换行 only abnormality suggesting the likelihood of interstitial lung disease and in this setting  删除换行 biopsy is essential. Smoking is almost universal in reported cases of CPFE, ground  删除换行 glass attenuation may be indicative of smoking-related interstitial lung diseases such  删除换行 as desquamative interstitial pneumonia. Incidentally, lung nodules or masses may be  删除换行 found in patients with CPFE because the prevalence of lung cancer in this population  删除换行 appears to be high. Diagnosis of the CPFE syndrome is established after HRCT imaging  删除换行 in combination with pathology. Lung biopsy is rarely required. There is no definitive  删除换行 treatment for the CPFE syndrome at present. The first recommended treatment for COPD  删除换行 and IPF is smoking cessation, which should be encouraged for CPFE as well because it  删除换行 may halt the progression of disease. In order to reduce acute exacerbations and infections,  删除换行 patients are suggested to recieve a long-term oxygen therapy and take vaccination against  删除换行 influenza viruses and streptococcus pneumonia. Oxygen therapy is known as the most  删除换行 definitive treatment for hypoxemia and pulmonary hypertension in CPFE.

This should be completed in less than 10 seconds  删除换行 and CPR resumed if there is no palpable pulse or signs of life. Ventilation may be carried out via  删除换行 several methods. The simplest is via a bag-valve-mask connected to high flow oxygen. If there  删除换行 are trained practitioners, this should be changed to either a supraglottic device (i-gel®, LMA) or  删除换行 preferably endotracheal intubation as soon as possible. In cases of submersion, this is advan删除8：<u>￾</u>tageous as it allows increased positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP), which will recruit  删除换行 collapsed or flooded alveoli. Once this has been established, it is recommended to switch to  删除换行 continuous chest compressions at 100 per minute and ventilation at a rate of 10–12 breaths  删除换行 per minute. There is often concern for concurrent cervical spine injury in these cases, and it  删除换行 may add a layer of complexity into management. Without evidence of diving or head injury,  删除换行 the incidence is around 0.5%, and spinal precautions are not required in every case.\n\n【20】During the resuscitation attempt potentially reversible causes of cardiac arrest should be  删除换行 sought and corrected. They are hypoxia, hypothermia, hypovolaemia, hypo- or hyperkalae删除8：<u>￾</u>mia (and other electrolytes), tension pneumothorax, tamponade, toxins and thromboembo删除8：<u>￾</u>lism (4Hs and 4Ts).\n\n【21】This patient is complex and has several potential reversible causes. The submersion injury  删除换行 will almost certainly cause pulmonary oedema by flooding the lungs with contaminated  删除换行 water and mixing with surfactant. Endotracheal intubation and warmed high flow oxygen  删除换行 are keys to reversing hypoxia here.\n\n【22】The alcohol ingestion combined with the prolonged submersion means that the patient  删除换行 may be hypovolaemic. Warmed 0.9% saline or other cystalloid solution should be used to  删除换行 resuscitate the patient. Arterial or venous blood gas testing should be performed as soon as  删除换行 practically possible as it will help to identify any correctible electrolyte disturbances. Heavy  删除换行 alcohol consumption will contribute to a metabolic acidosis as well as cellular hypoxia from  删除换行 the cardiac arrest but should improve with fluid administration. Sodium bicarbonate (8.4%) \n\n【23】may be considered for extreme metabolic acidosis in those that fail to improve with fluid  删除换行 resuscitation.\n\n【24】The core temperature was noted to be 29°C, and efforts should be made to rewarm the  删除换行 patient in the ED. Possible options include warmed intravenous fluids, removal of cold wet  删除换行 clothes and forced warm air induction (Baire® hugger). Advanced warming techniques such  删除换行 as bladder lavage, peritoneal lavage or ECMO may be employed if available.\n\n【25】Arrhythmias due to the sudden temperature change may be a contributing cause and if pres删除8：<u>￾</u>ent should be managed per ALS guidelines. Below 30°C, up to three attempts should be made  删除换行 for DC cardioversion and drugs (adrenaline, amiodarone) withheld until core temperature is \n\n【26】>30°C.

She usually sees the practice nurse for this procedure, but the nurse is  删除换行 currently on leave. The medical records reveal that the patient has returned for the injections  删除换行 regularly for the past 4 years.\n\n【3】Being unaware of the patient’s reasons for this choice of contraceptive method, the GP takes  删除换行 a contraceptive history. The woman says that she is very satisfied with her current choice of  删除换行 contraception. She used to rely on the combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) and when she  删除换行 was 40 years old she was advised that she could continue it but with a dose of ethinlyoestra删除8：<u>￾</u>diol of less than 30 mg as a first choice. At the time, she wished to further reduce her risk of  删除换行 deep vein thrombosis (DVT), having read about the increased risk with flying and a colleague  删除换行 having developed a DVT on the combined pill, so she chose to stop her COCP. Coming off  删除换行 the COCP, her menstrual loss was heavier and lasted 2 extra days, interfering with work. She  删除换行 used condoms for a while and then decided to use a safer contraception so changed to the  删除换行 progesterone-only pill (POP, mini-pill). However, because of her international flight schedule  删除换行 and moving daily between time zones, she found it difficult to remember when to take the pill  删除换行 and no longer wanted to use a pill method. The woman had been pregnant once and the preg删除8：<u>￾</u>nancy ended in a miscarriage. The investigations that followed revealed a bicornuate uterus.\n\n【4】She returned to see the nurse who started her on the Depo-Provera injection. Initially, the  删除换行 woman suffered some irregular and erratic light vaginal bleeding, but since the second injec删除8：<u>￾</u>tion, she has not had any further periods. She is delighted that her monthly bleeds have  删除换行 stopped and she denies any hot sweats or peri-menopausal symptoms. She asks the GP how  删除换行 she would know she has reached menopause so that she can stop her injections.\n\n【5】The GP is aware of recommendations from drug manufacturers that include careful  删除换行 re-evaluation of the risks and benefits of treatment in those who wish to continue use for  删除换行 more than 2 years. He knows there have been concerns about loss of bone density associated  删除换行 with administration of the drug. Assessing the woman’s risk for osteoporosis extends his  删除换行 history-taking. She has never smoked and drinks less than 3 units of alcohol/week. She has  删除换行 never taken oral steroid medication. She eats a balanced diet with an adequate calcium  删除换行 intake. Her body mass index has always been around 22. She takes part in weight-bearing  删除换行 sporting activities at least three times a week. In summer, she plays tennis twice a week and  删除换行 goes to aerobic dancing class once a week. In winter, she substitutes her tennis with jogging  删除换行 or badminton. The woman is aware of the risks of osteoporosis related to the injections and  删除换行 to her age. She has no family history of osteoporosis and has never broken a bone. The woman  删除换行 is quite clear that she wants to continue with this contraceptive method.\n\n【6】Questions\n\n【7】• What contraceptive options does this woman have?\n\n【8】• How should the GP manage this woman’s situation?删除5：<u>56</u>\n删除7：<u>100 Cases in General Practice, Second Edition</u>\nANSWER 27\n\n【9】Guidelines from the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare suggest that women over  删除换行 40 years of age, based on age alone can continue with any form of contraception. The patient  删除换行 has no contraindications to any form of contraception apart from her uterine abnormal删除8：<u>￾</u>ity which is a relative contraindication to insertion of an intra-uterine contraceptive device \n\n【10】(IUCD).\n\n【11】Once the GP has discussed the alternative contraceptive options, it is reasonable for him to  删除换行 continue prescribing the injection. However, the progesterone-only contraceptive implant  删除换行 may be an even better option for this woman as it lasts for 3 years before it needs to be  删除换行 replaced and appears to have less effect on bone density. The patient, after discussion, is keen  删除换行 to have the implant which will last until the normal age of menopause, 52 years of age, when  删除换行 it can be removed and no further contraception is needed. She is well informed and is able to  删除换行 give informed consent. Her GP refers her to the local family planning unit where the implant  删除换行 can be inserted.\n\n【12】• Choosing appropriate contraceptive methods can be challenging, sometimes  删除换行 more difficult for older women or women in specific occupations and change as  删除换行 life circumstances change.\n\n【13】• Manufacturer’s recommendations can put prescribers in a quandary when they  删除换行 conflict with common management practices.\n\n【14】• Guidelines change as research findings build, so keep up to date with modern  删除换行 practice.\n删除12：<u>Key Points57\n\n【15】Case 28: Cough</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

She had a retroverted uterus without any abnormality and multiple cysts on the left ovary indicative of polycystic ovarian syndrome.\n\n【3】To rule PCOS in or out， evaluating androgens is recommended， along with a hemoglobin A1c to evaluate insulin resistance. Hypothyroidism can be diagnosed with a TSH level. Serum prolactin and DHEA are needed to rule in or rule out the suspicion of hyperprolactinemia. Since Annette reported being sexually active without a form of contraception， getting an HCG is wise. Other labs for routine health maintenance include a vitamin D level， HIV test， and urinalysis. In addition to laboratory studies， a transvaginal ultrasound is needed to evaluate for the presence of ovarian abnormalities. An abdominal ultrasound can also help pinpoint the cause of the abdominal pain.\n\n【4】**What is the most likely differential diagnosis and why?**\n\n【5】**_H. pylori infection and PCOS_**\n\n【6】Since the laboratory studies give a positive result， we can conclude that Annette's abdominal pain is at least in part due to an H. pylori infection. The ultrasound reveals that she does have gallstones， though her LFTs are within normal limits and her constellation of symptoms do not suggest an acute gallstone emergency. While her symptoms do still fall under the possible realm of GERD， it is likely that the plan to eradicate the H. pylori infection will include gastric acid suppression， therefore alle-viating the shared symptoms.\n\n【7】It is now commonly known that greater than 95% of duodenal ulcers and greater than 90% of gastric ulcers are caused by an infection by the bacterium H. pylori. Other causes of aggravation of peptic ulcer disease include stress， smoking， alcohol， and coffee. H. pylori affects the mucosal defenses 删除换行 by attaching to the epithelium， causing apoptosis and an inflammatory response. This leads to increased gastric acid production， increased pepsin secretion， and a decrease in mucosal defense. Symptoms of peptic ulcer disease include intermittent epigastric pain that can last for days at a time and then be absent for months. The pain is most often relieved by antacids.\n\n【8】Annette's secondary amenorrhea， hirsutism， acne， and obesity reflect a constellation of symptoms associated with PCOS. PCOS affects 5%-7% of women， and many symptoms overlap with those of metabolic syndrome. Since PCOS is a condition of hyperandrogenism， it would explain Annette's increased male-pattern hair growth and her acne. PCOS is a clinical diagnosis based on 2 of the fol-lowing criteria： 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> oligo or anovulation， 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> hyperandrogenism or hyperandrogenemia， or 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> poly-cystic ovaries. Lab studies for PCOS would show androgen elevation， decreased sex hormone binding globulin， increased LH， low-normal FSH， and hyperinsulinemia.\n\n【9】PCOS is the most likely diagnosis given the subjective reports of Annette， coupled with the objec-tive laboratory study and ultrasound findings. While the Rotterdam criteria for diagnosis only require2 of the 3 diagnostic criteria， Annette meets all 3， along with the very common constellation of signs and symptoms. At least 50% of women with PCOS also have marked insulin resistance， which is seen with Annette as demonstrated by her A1c level. Due to the overlap with metabolic syndrome， she will find herself at risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus. The condition of PCOS also has repercussions for fertility， as anovulation is among the symptoms. While there is a great deal about PCOS that is still unknown， the common treatment approach is the correction of hyperinsu-linemia via either weight loss， medications， or both.\n\n【10】Hypothyroidism can be ruled out due to the normal TSH level. The shared symptoms of hair growth， weight gain， and menstrual irregularities can also be explained by PCOS. Though Annette does not appear to have this disorder， hypothyroidism can be easily treated with exogenous thyroid hormone replacement. Monitoring is required and dose adjustments may be needed to assure a con-stant euthyroid state， but many individuals with the disease only require daily maintenance medication.\n\n【11】While the lab results show that Annette does in fact have hyperprolactinemia， knowing that it often occurs with PCOS suggests that Annette has both disorders. The treatment approach would be to address the PCOS first and hope that both states are normalized through a streamlined treatment.\n\n【12】_1\\._ Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)： Epigastric abdominal pain exacerbated by high-fat foods is a common complaint of individuals with reflux. Heartburn， regurgitation， and difficulty swallowing often accompany the abdominal pain. The physical exam of someone with GERD can often be negative， while other times dental erosion is seen and epigastric tenderness is noted. Contributing lifestyle factors to GERD include tobacco use， alcohol use， excessive chocolate inges-tion， high-fat meals， and high-carbohydrate meals.\n\n【13】_2\\._ Cholecystitis： The fact that a previous practitioner noted gallstones on an ultrasound sug-gests that Annette’s abdominal pain could be caused by an acute gallbladder infection. Cholecys-titis is often hallmarked by dyspepsia， belching， bloating， and sudden onset colicky epigastric pain that is accompanied by nausea and vomiting. An acute gallstone emergency， choledo-cholithiasis， will present as recurrent pain plus mildly increased LFTs. It is possible to have asymptomatic gallstones， as well， which is often an incidental finding and does not require intervention.\n\n【14】3\\. Hypothyroidism： Annette’s unexplained weight gain， along with her goiter， dark hair， and heavy periods suggest the diagnosis of hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism is fairly common， and occurs much more often in women than men. The disease presents with the symptoms above， along with fatigue， constipation， dry skin， and cold intolerance. On exam， besides a goiter， there may be diminished bowel sounds or delayed deep tendon reflexes. The diagnosis of hypothyroidism can be confirmed by an increased TSH level and a low or normal free T4 level.\n\n【15】_4\\._ Hyperprolactinemia： Hyperprolactinemia is a possible explanation for Annette's hirsutism， as prolactin stimulates androgen production， and androgen excess is the cause of excess dark hair. Other common features are amenorrhea and galactorrhea. Hyperprolactinemia often appears accompanying PCOS.\n\n【16】**What is your plan of treatment?**\n\n【17】The protocol for eradicating H. pylori includes antibiotics and acid suppression. Antibiotic therapy works to promote ulcer healing， prevent relapse， and decrease the need for long-term acid suppres-sion. In all cases， combination antibiotic therapy is needed due to the high rates of resistance. To suppress acid， proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are most often used. An appropriate treatment for Annette would be lansoprazole (30mg twice daily)， amoxicillin (500mg twice daily)， and clarithro-mycin (500mg twice daily) for 14 days. There are several different combination therapy suggestions ranging from 7-14 day treatments.\n\n【18】The treatment plan for Annette's PCOS should be based mostly on her symptoms. Three reasons for treatment can be considered in her case： 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> regulation of uterine bleeding and reduction in risk for endometrial hyperplasia， 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> the improvement of dermatological complaints including acne and increased dark hair growth， and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> the correction and prevention of possible metabolic abnor-malities， including DM and cardiovascular disease. To address Annette’s irregular menstrual bleed ing， a hormonal contraceptive method should be considered based on her individual contraceptive needs and comfort level. A common starting place is the combined oral contraceptive pill (COC)， but the ring and progestin-only methods such as the implant or the hormonal IUD could also be considered.\n\n【19】To address Annette's complaint of acne and dark hair growth， an androgen receptor blocker could be considered as pharmacotherapy in an extreme circumstance. However， if looking for a more conservative treatment， choosing a combined contraceptive option would improve acne； and a cosmetic route could be chosen for the hair growth (such as bleaching， electrolysis， or laser removal).\n\n【20】The correction of any metabolic abnormalities is also of great concern， and the treatment should begin with a discussion of diet and lifestyle modifications. Many studies have shown that weight loss can lower the level of circulating androgens， thus causing the resumption of normal menstrual patterns and the reduction in insulin resistance. Since Annette's lab studies show a high hemoglobin A1c level， indicative of long-term insulin resistance， starting a hypoglycemic agent would be an acceptable adjunct therapy to lifestyle changes.\n\n【21】To address preventive health practices for Annette， starting her on daily calcium， vitamin D， and fish oil supplementation would also be appropriate.\n\n【22】It would be important to follow up with Annette after her treatment course to see if the H. pylori infection was in fact eradicated. If the infection persists， it would be appropriate to continue therapy， most likely changing antibiotics due to suspicion of resistance. If the infection was eradicated but symptoms persist for more than 4 weeks， it would be recommended to refer for a gastrointestinal specialist for endoscopic evaluation.\n\n【23】PCOS is a common condition that can be managed within the realm of primary care， so it would not be recommended that Annette be followed by a specialist. However， to evaluate progress on the treatment options discussed today， the time frame for acceptable follow-up visits would be monthlor the first 3 months and then quarterly unt yy fil specific treatment goals are reached. At the follow-upD visits， diet and exercise journals should be reviewed； and blood tests should be done to evaluate insulin resistance (hemoglobin A1c) and androgen levels (FHS， LH， testosterone). Since this is also Annette's establishment of primary care， it is important to encourage followups for routine gynecol-ogy care and other routine health maintenance.\n\n【24】**What if the patient had a positive pregnancy test?**\n\n【25】If Annette had a positive pregnancy te VEst， the first step would be to establish if this was a planned PIEand/or desired pregnancy. If the pregnancy is either unplanned or undesired， options counseling should be included to discuss keeping the pregnancy， adoption， and termination of the pregnancy. If Annette wanted to continue the pregnancy， she should be offered or referred to prenatal care. Since a common side effect of PCOS is the inability to conceive due to irregular cycles， she has already overcome a hurdle of the condition. The treatment for irregular menstrual bleeding would be a topic to address postpartum. Metformin is category B in pregnancy， so it would be acceptable to treat the insulin resistance concomitantly with the pregnancy. Androgen receptor blockers would be contra-indicated during pregnancy.\n\n【26】**What if the patient was trying to conceive?**\n\n【27】To treat infertility， a fair trial of treatment should be done to evaluate whether regular menstrual patterns return. If difficulty conceiving persists beyond 9 months or a year， referral to a fertility spe-cialist is acceptable.\n\n【28】**Are there any standardized guidelines that you should use to assess or treat this case?**\n\n【29】There are 3 published guidelines for the diagnosis of PCOS. National Institutes of Health， European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology/ American Society of Reproductive Medicine， and Androgen Excess Society (https：//nurse-practitioners-and-physician-assistants.advanceweb.com/SharedResources/Downloads/2010/012510/NP020110\\_p18table1.pdf). The Rotterdam criteria are most widely used， as they increase the affected population by about 50% and include less severe forms of the condition.\n\n【30】NOTE： The author would like to recognize Amanda La Manna， RN， ANP for her contribution to the editing of this case.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

He then developed additional bumps over the top of his head. There was associated “cheesy” drainage and alopecia. He attempted to apply his topical acne medications to the area with mild improvement. He has not had any fevers or chills.\n\n【11】Physical Examination\n--------------------\n\n【12】On examination, numerous erythematous papules and pustules are noted on the vertex & occiput . There are also fluctuant cysts and nodules with connecting sinus tracts. The nodules are tender to palpation and express a thick, white exudate. There are areas of hair loss over the nodules.\n删除3：<u>Figure 5.1\n\n【13】Dissecting cellulitis. Scattered erythematous papules and pustules are noted on the vertex with alopecia and tufted hairs\n</u>\nClinical Differential Diagnosis\n-------------------------------\n\n【14】The patient’s presentation is most consistent with dissecting cellulitis of the scalp (DCS). Other conditions to be considered in the differential diagnosis included acne keloidalis nuchae, tinea capitis or kerion, folliculitis decalvans, and cutis verticis gyrata. Unlike DCS, acne keloidalis does not present with sinus tracts, suppurative nodules, or cicatricial alopecia. A KOH preparation or positive fungal culture can help differentiate DCS from tinea capitis. Folliculitis decalvans can present with cicatricial alopecia like DCS, but does not present with sinus tracts or nodules. It is sometimes categorized as a more superficial variant of DCS. Cutis verticis gyrata is usually asymptomatic and does not present with sinus tracts or suppurative nodules 删除10：<u>(Madu and Kundu 2014 ; Ross et al. 2005 )</u>.\n\n【15】Histopathology\n--------------\n\n【16】A biopsy was not performed in this case because the history and physical exam were felt to be sufficient for diagnosis. When biopsy of DCS is performed, histopathology reveals distention of the follicular infundibulum with perifollicular, mixed neutrophilic and lymphoplasmacytic inflammation. The inflammatory process involves the lower dermis and subcutaneous junction. Scarring and fibrosis can be seen in chronic lesions 删除10：<u>(Sperling 2001 )</u>.\n\n【17】Diagnosis\n---------\n\n【18】Dissecting cellulitis of the scalp (DCS)\n\n【19】Case Treatment\n--------------\n\n【20】The nature of the diagnosis of DCS was reviewed with the patient. Treatment options including oral antibiotics, oral or intralesional corticosteroids, oral isotretinoin, laser treatments, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors were discussed. After a discussion of the risks and benefits of each treatment, the patient elected to start oral isotretinoin given the extensive presentation of his disease and the desire to reduce the development of further scarring alopecia. The patient was started on 1 mg/kg/day of oral isotretinoin until clinical remission of the disease was achieved 3 months later, followed by a maintenance dose of 0.75 mg/kg/day for 4 months afterwards. His cumulative dose was 180 mg/kg. Upon completion of the treatment, the patient had satisfactory partial hair regrowth in areas of previous hair loss and did not have recurrence of the disease at 1-year follow-up.\n\n【21】Discussion\n----------\n\n【22】Dissecting cellulitis of the scalp is a chronic inflammatory condition of the follicles of the scalp characterized by fluctuant nodules, cysts, draining sinus tracts, and secondary scarring alopecia 删除10：<u>(Madu and Kundu 2014 )</u>. At least 80 % of all cases of dissecting cellulitis of the scalp occur in black men between the ages of 18–40. It has been less frequently reported in white males (10 % of cases), in women, and in children 删除10：<u>(Ross et al. 2005 )</u>.\n\n【23】DCS follows a chronic and relapsing course 删除10：<u>(Ross et al. 2005 )</u>. It initially presents as a follicular pustule (folliculitis) at the scalp vertex or occiput, which then transforms into a painful nodule. Multiple similar and contiguous papules and nodules occur shortly thereafter, giving the scalp a cerebriform appearance. During periods of waning, hypertrophic or atrophic scarring of the scalp remains and a pattern of cerebriform folds and furrows mimicking cutis verticus gyrata may occur 删除10：<u>(Coley and Alexis 2009 )</u>. The condition does not usually involve the entire scalp. Purulent or keratinaceous discharge may be expressed from the lesions spontaneously or with applied pressure. Due to the interconnecting sinus tracts, pressure applied on one nodule/abscess can lead to expression of purulent material from an interconnected nodule. An unpleasant odor can be associated with the disease due to the presence of secondary infection. Early disease can present with a nonscarring alopecia. Long-standing disease can lead to cicatricial alopecia. The inflammatory nature of the disease can lead to the development of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.\n\n【24】The precise mechanism for the development of DCS is unknown but is thought to involve follicular occlusion. Keratin debris can occlude the pilosebaceous unit leading to follicular expansion, subsequent inflammation, and dilation 删除10：<u>(Madu and Kundu 2014 )</u>. Secondary bacterial infection of the follicle with either Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa , or anaerobic bacteria leads to a folliculitis or perifolliculitis 删除10：<u>(Coley and Alexis 2009 )</u>. When these inflamed follicles rupture they release keratin and bacteria, which precipitates a localized neutrophilic and granulomatous response leading to abscess formation. Abscesses can then expand and coalesce to form interconnecting abscesses and sinus tracts 删除10：<u>(Coley and Alexis 2009 )</u>. The presence of hair follicles is necessary for the disease process; when follicles are eliminated, such as by laser hair removal or scalpectomy, the disease improves 删除10：<u>(Coley and Alexis 2009 )</u>.\n\n【25】On trichoscopy of DCS, early findings can mimic non-scarring alopecia with empty follicular openings, yellow dots, and black dots. With progression of disease, dermoscopy reveals yellow structureless areas and dystrophic hair shafts with overlying yellow dots that have a “three-dimensional” structure. Dermoscopy of long-standing disease will reflect scar formation and reveal confluent, ivory-white areas lacking follicular openings 删除10：<u>(Mubki et al. 2014 )</u>.\n\n【26】Biopsy may or may not be necessary to make a diagnosis of DCS, depending on the extent of the disease and the phase of disease that the patient presents in. Before undertaking biopsy, the physician should consider the risk of hypertrophic scarring and keloid formation, which occur at higher rates in patients with ethnic skin 删除10：<u>(Robles and Berg 2007 )</u>. Cosmesis should be considered when choosing a biopsy site on the scalp. Intralesional corticosteroid injection can be considered to minimize the risk of keloid formation in patients with a known keloid diathesis.\n\n【27】DCS is associated with hidradenitis suppurativa and acne conglobata, collectively referred to as the follicular occlusion triad or, when seen in conjunction with pilonidal cysts, a tetrad. All of these disorders share pathogenesis related to follicular occlusion, secondary infection, and deep inflammation 删除10：<u>(Ross et al. 2005 )</u>. Hidradenitis suppurativa is the development of deep-seated painful nodules, abscesses, draining sinuses, and scarring in intertriginous areas. Acne conglobata is a nodulocystic form of acne vulgaris that presents with comedones, papules, pustules, nodules, abscesses, and draining sinus tracts on the face, chest, back, and buttocks. Pilonidal cysts present as painful cyst near the intergluteal cleft that can lead to the development of an abscess or draining sinus tracts.\n\n【28】One-third of patients presenting with DCS may concurrently present with another condition of the follicular occlusion triad. The co-occurrence of two or more follicular occlusion triad conditions is a risk factor for the development of HLA-B27-negative spondyloarthropathy in black males, characterized by an asymmetric peripheral and axial joint arthritis. Other associated clinical conditions include sternoclavicular hyperostosis with polyarticular arthritis, SAPHO syndrome (synovitis, acne, palmoplantar pustulosis, hyperostosis, osteitis), and marginal keratitis. Squamous cell carcinoma can arise in the setting of DCS, and relapsing cases of DCS increase the risk of development of Staphylococcus aureus scalp osteomyelitis 删除10：<u>(Jerome et al. 2014 )</u>.\n\n【29】### Treatment\n\n【30】Data on the treatment of DCS are limited to case reports and small case series; there are no large clinical trials. Mild cases can sometimes be managed with antiseptics, topical antibiotics, lesional aspiration, and corticosteroid injections 删除10：<u>(Jerome et al. 2014 )</u>. Treatment for more severe cases of DCS can be further categorized as medical, destructive, or surgical.\n\n【31】First-line medical therapy for severe cases of DCS is oral isotretinoin. Treatment with oral isotretinoin has a multifactorial effect on the pilosebaceous unit including changing the keratinization of the follicle, suppressing sebaceous gland activity, and exerting an anti-inflammatory effect 删除10：<u>(Plewig et al. 1982 )</u>. A long course of isotretinoin is usually needed, with cumulative dosing around 170–180 mg/kg to see improvement 删除10：<u>(Khaled et al. 2007 )</u>. The isotretinoin course is also prolonged several months after clinical remission in order to decrease the risk of relapse. A recent review article recommended an initial dose of 1 mg/kg/day followed by a maintenance dose of 0.75 mg/kg/day for at least 4 months after clinical control of the disorder was achieved 删除10：<u>(Mundi et al. 2012 )</u>. Case reports using similar dosage guidelines illustrate the disease course during treatment with oral isotretinoin: remission was achieved by month 2–4, hair regrowth by month 6, treatment was stopped at month 9–12, and there was no evidence of recurrence at 3–6 month follow-up 删除10：<u>(Khaled et al. 2007 ; Koca et al. 2002 )</u>. Similarly, a retrospective study of seven cases of DCS showed complete healing and regrowth following oral isotretinoin administration at 0.75 mg/kg/day for 9–12 months 删除10：<u>(Koudoukpo et al. 2014 )</u>. Another case series of four patients reported the use of rifampin 300 mg twice daily for 4 months to stop progression of DCS, followed by oral isotretinoin at 0.5 mg/kg/day for 3–4 months to induce complete remission; no recurrence was noted in 10–12 month follow-up 删除10：<u>(Georgala et al. 2008 )</u>. One case report demonstrated remission with topical isotretinoin 删除10：<u>(Karpouzis et al. 2003 )</u>.\n\n【32】Oral and intralesional corticosteroids may also be used for their anti-inflammatory effect. However, intralesional corticosteroids do not induce long-term remission of the disease and are used only as a temporizing measure for symptom management.

What is the other life-threatening rash that should be included on the differential diagnosis?\n\n【6】iii. What is the treatment for this condition?\n\n【7】Answer 74\n\n【8】i. Based on the history, morphologic features of the eruption and recent exposure to intravenous antibiotics for the treatment of osteomyelitis, the patient has developed acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), a febrile neutrophilic drug rash. AGEP is characterized by non-follicular, small, sterile pustules that tend to arise on the neck or flexural surfaces, which can disseminate over a course of hours. After 1–2 weeks, superficial desquamation is observed in the areas of involvement. Edema is seen in half of the patients, involving the face and hands. Vesicles, bullae and mucous membrane involvement are also commonly observed. Greater than 90% of the cases of AGEP are due to drugs, with the most common culprits being beta-lactam antibiotics and macrolides, followed by calcium channel blockers and antimalarials. Although the underlying mechanism of AGEP is still unknown, there are certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA) types that have been found at higher rates in patients with AGEP, including HLA-B5, HLA-DR11 and HLA-DQ3.\n\n【9】ii. The primary lesions of AGEP can be identical to the pustules seen in the von Zumbusch type of acute pustular psoriasis. In the latter entity, immediate medical care is imperative as this form of pustular psoriasis can be life-threatening, requiring intravenous fluids, topical and systemic treatment, including antibiotics. Patients with psoriasis tend to have a higher risk of developing AGEP, which can make the distinction even more challenging. Histologically, the presence of edema in the superficial dermis, exocytosis of eosinophils and necrosis of keratinocytes are suggestive of AGEP, in contrast to the acanthosis seen in pustular psoriasis.\n\n【10】iii. The treatment of AGEP involves withdrawal of the culprit medication(s), along with topical corticosteroids.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

She had been seen by her regular doctor earlier in the day and prescribed amoxillin for sinusitis. Paramedics report field vital signs remarkable for a blood pressure of 70/30 mm Hg， heart rate of 140 beats per min-ute， respiratory rate of 40 breaths per minute， and an oxygen saturation of 76%. Intravenous fluids and oxygen were administered during transport. Paramedics are assisting the patient’s breathing with bag-valve mask ventilation， but oxygen saturations remains low. On physical examination， the patient is obtunded with perioral cyanosis， tongue swelling， stidor， wheezing， and labored breathing. Her skin is cool and clammy with large urticarial lesions.\n\n【1】What are the next steps?\n\n【2】**What treatments should be instituted?**\n\n【3】**ANSWERS TO CASE 10：**\n\n【4】Summary： This patient is demonstrating signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis. Ana-phylaxis is rapidly progressive severe allergic reaction which compromises a patient's airway， breathing， and circulation. Patients may also exhibit flushing， hives， and swelling of mucous membranes. Successful treatment of anaphylaxis requires early recognition of the symptoms of anaphylaxis， support of the airway， and administra-tion of epinephrine.\n\n【5】Next step： In the presence of symptoms meeting the diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis， epinephrine should be administered immediately. The first dose should be administered intramuscularly. In the setting of a severe reaction like the one described above， moving quickly to intravenous infusion of epineph-rine is recommended.\n\n【6】●Further treatments： This patient requires rapid resuscitation and stabilization. Airway， breathing， and circulation (ABCs) should be managed appropriately and in that order， which will mean both procedural and pharmacological inter-vention. A definitive airway will need to be immediately established in the face of impending airway obstruction ， and the patient's cardiovascular compromise must be supported with epinephrine. Experts have referred to the ABCs of anaphylaxis as A E B C； the E is for epinephrine.\n\n【7】In addition to airway management and early administration of epinephrine， phar-macologic therapy is tailored to the other systemic manifestations of the anaphy-lactic response. These include volume resuscitation with crystalloid， nebulized beta agonists， nebulized racemic epinephrine， corticosteroids， antihistamines (including H， blockers)， and removal of any remaining antigen (ie， the bee stinger).\n\n【8】**ANALYSIS**\n\n【9】_Objectives_\n\n【10】1\\. Rapidly recognize the characteristic clinical features of anaphylaxis.\n\n【11】2\\. Understand the underlying pathophysiology of anaphylaxis.\n\n【12】3\\. Become familiar with the available treatment options； most importantly the cor-rect administration of epinephrine.\n\n【13】**_Considerations_**\n\n【14】This patient is brought into the ED with swelling of the tongue and labored breath-ing. The perioral cyanosis， diffuse wheezing， stridor， and hypoxia all indicate impending respiratory failure. A delay of even a minute may be life-threatening. The most important intervention in addition to administration of epinephrine is securing an airway. This patient likely has edema of the pharynx and larynx 删除换行 making intubation technically difficult. Airway management in a patient like this often requires a cricothyroidotomy.\n\n【15】Intravenous access with administration of epinephrine is the most important pharmacologic intervention. Epinephrine should first be given intramuscularly； if that route fails， an intravenous drip should be initiated. Dosing of epinephrine will be covered below. Identification of the inciting agent is not essential for treat-ment of anaphylaxis， but is helpful in preventing further exposures and recurrence of symptoms.\n\n【16】**APPROACH TO：**\n\n【17】_Epidemiology_\n\n【18】Millions of people present to emergency departments every year complaining of allergic symptoms ranging from the minor rashes to multisystf+1em anaphylaxis. Mostof the time， it is difficult if not impossible to identify the trigger. Many reactions may occur in response to medical therapies such as antibiotics and radiologic con-trast agents. Because the spectrum of allergic responses is so broad， anaphylaxis is likely underreported. As a result it is difficult to calculate a precise incidence of this disease. There are an estimated 30，000 ED visits every year for adverse food reac-tions. However， there are far more visits for more vague complaints and unknown exposures that may be difficult to identify as anaphylaxis. In the emergency depart-ment the goal is rapid diagnosis， symptomatic treatment， and prevention of further episodes.\n\n【19】_Pathophysiology_\n\n【20】True anaphylaxis is a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction occurring after a previous sensitizing exposure. In its purest form， this is an immune-mediated activation of basophils and mast cells with subsequent release of prostaglandins，leukotrienes， and histamine. From a clinical standpoint， an anaphylactoid reaction also includes release of these compounds but through non-immune-mediated pathways. The only clinical significance of this difference is that anaphylactoid reactions can occur without prior sensitization. Regardless of the underlying mechanism， their effects are similar， and early recognition will determine successful clinical management in these patients .\n\n【21】When first exposed to a substance， binding antibodies trigger class switching and regulatory changes in gene expression， effectively priming the immune system for its next encounter with the offending agent. In certain cases， this leads to immuno-globulin (igE) binding mast cells and basophils. In the classically defined anaphy-lactic reaction， the antigen again encounters the immune system， binds to the IgE on the mast cells and basophils， and releases a flood of cytokines that set the clinical response in motion. In an anaphylactoid reaction， the antigen causes direct release\n\n| Table 10-1oPITFALLS IN ANAPHYLAXIS  |\n| --- |\n| Failure to recognize the symptoms of anaphylaxis Underestimating the severity of laryngeal edema and failure to secure the airway earlyReluctance to administer epinephrine early in the course of illness Forgetting to remove the allergen； eg， the IV drip of penicillin or bee stinger Lack of appropriate patient education Failure to prescribe an epinephrine auto-injector prior to discharge  |\n\n【23】of cytokines by mast cells and basophils， without need for prior sensitization. In both cases， the end result is the same， and clinically indistinguishable.\n\n【24】The early stages of some anaphylactic reactions involve increased secretion by mucous membranes. In addition to watery eyes and rhinorrhea， increased bron-chial secretions and increased smooth muscle tone cause wheezing and increase the work of breathing. Decreased vascular tone and increased capillary permeability lead to cardiovascular compromise and hypotension. Patients may lose over 30% of their blood volume to extravasation in the first ten minutes of their allergic reaction. Other cytokines， specifically histamine， can cause urticaria and angioedema. There are numerous cytokines involved in the immunologic cascade following exposure， but no one major substance is felt to be primarily responsible. Leukotriene C， pros-taglandin D。 histamine， and tryptase are known key components in the reaction. Elevated tryptase levels confirm the diagnosis.\n\n【25】**_Causes_**\n\n【26】Some of the most common causes of anaphylaxis are healthcare related， most noto-riously allergies to penicillin and sulfa-containing medications. Some studies suggest as many as 1 in 500 exposures to penicillin will result in anaphylaxis. Radiographic intravenous contrast agents can also cause anaphylaxis. This reaction is not IgE mediated， and is more common in patients receiving the less-expensive hyperosmo-lar agents. Overall， there are an estimated 0.9 fatal reactions per 100，000 patients exposed to intravenous contrast. This number skyrockets to 60% in patients who have had a prior exposure and reaction.\n\n【27】Hymenoptera， or bee and wasp， stings are another cause of anaphylaxis. Ana-phylaxis from stings results in an average of 50 deaths per year in the United States. Overall， the number of cases of arthropod anaphylaxis seen by physicians is small compared to the number of iatrogenic cases， but because exposures often occur miles from medical treatment， they can have serious outcomes.\n\n【28】Food sources round out the major causes of serious allergic reactions. Peanuts are easily the most common cause of serious allergies， but any food can be responsible. Other common food allergens include eggs and shellfish.\n\n【29】_Diagnosis_\n\n【30】**The diagnosis of anaphylaxis is made clinically. The most commonly affected sys-tem is the skin， which manifests with angioedema， urticaria， erythema， and pruritus in at least 80% of patients with anaphylaxis. The cardiovascular system is also affected， primarily as a result of decrease vasomotor tone and capillary leakage.**\n\n【31】This leads to hypotension and tachycardia. Respiratory compromise is common. Bronchospasm and bronchorrhea in the lower respiratory tract in combination with edema of the upper respiratory tract are the most feared and difficult to manage aspects of anaphylaxis. After administration of epinephrine， control of the airway the most important therapeutic intervention， as nearly all deaths caused by anaphylaxis are a result of airway compromise. Early and aggressive airway management删除17：<u>一</u>surgical if needed-is indicated in these patients. Gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea， cramping， and diarrhea may be seen， and are associated with particularly severe anaphylactic reactions.\n\n【32】_Clinical Criteria for Diagnosis of Anaphylaxis_\n\n【33】Clinical criteria were developed from a multidisciplinary symposium to best identify anaphylaxis early and accurately. Anaphylaxis is highly likely if any one of the fol-lowing three diagnostic criteria exist.\n\n【34】1\\. Acute onset (minutes to hours) with reaction of the skin and/or mucosal tissue in addition to respiratory symptoms or hypotension. Skin symptoms include itch-ing， redness， hives， generalized urticaria， and mucosal edema， Respiratory mani-festations include laryngeal stridor， bronchospasm， bronchorrhea， and hypoxia. Hypotension results from extravasation of fluid from the vasculature and loss of vasomotor tone.\n\n【35】**2\\. _删除17：<u>一</u>_ Two or more of the following occurring rapidly (minutes to hours) after exposure to a likely allergen： involvement of the skin-mucosal tissue， respiratory symp-toms， hypotension， or gastrointestinal symptoms. Gastrointestinal symptoms include abdominal pain， cramping， and diarrhea.**\n\n【36】**3\\. Hypotension occurring rapidly (minutes to hours) after exposure to known allergen for that patient. Hypotension may present as faintness or altered men-tal status.**\n\n【37】**_Treatment_**\n\n【38】The primary initial therapy for anaphylaxis is epinephrine . Epineph-rine will act as a pressor for hemodynamic support， a bronchodilator to relieve wheezing， as well as to counteract released mediators and prevent their further release. Epinephrine can be dosed intramuscularly or intravenously. Subcutaneous administration of epinephrine is no longer recommended as it has been proven less effective than intramuscular administration. Initial administration is intramuscular in the anterior thigh with the more concentrated 1：1000 dose at 0.3 to 0.5 mL every5 minutes. If there is no response or if the patient is already demonstrating cardio-vascular compromise， intravenous administration should be started immediately.\n\n【39】**IV epinephrine dosing can be confusing and potentially dangerous by provoking cardiac dysrhythmias. In general， all ampules of epinephrine have 1 mg of medica-tion (1 mL of 1：1000 = 1 mg of medication； 10 mL of 1：100，000=1 mg of medica-tion). One method of administration is to place 1 mg (1 ampule) of epinephrine into 1 L of intravenous fluid (equivalent to 1 ug/mL) and infuse to 1 to 4 cc/min(1-4 ug/min). This allows for precise titration of dosing to desired effect， and**\n\n| Table 10-2·TREATMENT FOR ANAPHYLAXIS  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Drug  | Adult Dose  | Pediatric Dose  |\n| Epinephrine  | IV single dose： 100 rg over 5-10 min； 1：100，000 dilution givenas 0.1 mg in 10 mL at 1 mL/minⅣ infusion： 1-4 ug/min IM： 0.3-0.5 mg (0.3-0.5mL of1：1000 dilution)  | IV infusion： 0.1-0.3 mcg/kg/ min； maximum 1.5 rg/kg/min IM：0.01 mg/kg (0.01 mL/kg of1：1000 dilution)  |\n| IV fluids： NS or LR  | 1-2-L bolus  | 10-15-mL/kg bolus  |\n| Diphenhydramine  | 25-50 mg q6h IV，IM， or PO  | 1 mg/kg q6h IV， IM， or PO  |\n| Ranitidine  | 50 mg lV over 5 min  | 0.5 mg/kg lV over 5 min  |\n| Cimetidine  | 300 mg IV  | 4-8 mg/kg IV  |\n| Hydrocortisone  | 250-500 mg IV  | 5-10 mg/kg IV (max： 500 mg)  |\n| Methylprednisolone  | 125 mg IV  | 1-2 mg/kg IV (max： 125 mg)  |\n| Albuterol  | Single treatment： 2.5-5.0 mg nebu-lized (0.5-1.0 mL of 0.5% solution)Continuous nebulization： 5-10mg/h  | Single treatment： 1.25-2.5mgnebulized (0.25-0.5 mL of 0.5%solution) Continuous nebulization： 3-5 mg/h  |\n| Ipratropium bromide  | Single treatment： 250-500 ugnebulized  | Single treatment： 125-250ngnebulized  |\n| Magnesium sulfate  | 2 g IV over 20 min  | 25-50 mg/kg lV over 20 min  |\n| Glucagon  | 1 mg lV q5min until hypotensionresolves， followed by 5-15 ug/mininfusion  | 50 rg/kg q5min  |\n| Prednisone  | 40-60 mg/day PO divided bid or qd(for outpatients： 3-5 days； tapering not required)  | 1-2 mg/day PO divided bid orqd (for outpatients： 3-5 days；tapering not required)  |\n\n【41】_Reprinted， with permission， from Tintinalli JE， Kelen GD， Stapczynski jS， eds.

Rotation flaps are considered workhorses when it comes to reconstructing scalp defects following skin cancer surgery or after surgery to correct alopecia. These are ‘random flaps’ i.e. depend on the vascular supply of the subdermal plexus and not based on a named skin perforator or specific cutaneous artery (the latter are termed ‘axial’ pattern flaps). The length of the random flap depends on the intravascular resistance of the supplying vessels and the perfusion pressure. When the perfusion pressure drops below a critical closing pressure of the arterioles in the subdermal plexus, nutritional blood flow ceases and flap ischemia occurs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Another way to differentiate random flaps is to classify them based on it their movement: is pivotal (rotating about a pivot as in rotation, rhomboid or bilobed flaps) or advancement flaps (wherein the skin is advanced forward with little sideways movement).\n\n【15】When it comes to rotation flaps, there is a biomechanical difference when compared to advancement flaps (even if rotation flaps do have a component where skin is ‘advanced’). In an advancement flap, the length to width ratio is critical. In a rotation flap, the traditional concept of a width-to-length ratio does not dictate flap survival – rather perfusion pressure becomes more important 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】As the name indicates, the rotation flap is a hemicircular flap and closure of a defect is effected by gently rotating skin about a pivot, along the perimeter of a portion of a circle. Typically, rotation flaps are designed to move along an arc of 30° or less with the radius approximately two to three times the diameter of the defect and the arc length approximately four to five times the width of the defect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】In these case studies, I review the different types of rotation flaps and the methods of adapting these flaps to close large defects of the scalp following cutaneous surgery for skin cancer. A detailed explanation is given of the different tension vectors and the orientation of different types of rotation flaps. While single, double and triple pedicled rotation flaps may be considered similar, they each have different biomechanical considerations that need to be taken into account while using these flaps to close large scalp defects.\n\n【18】Case Study 1\n\n【19】A 75 year old lady presented with a 3 cm keratinizing non-healing lesion on her scalp that she had attributed to trauma. Biopsy had proven this to be a squamous cell carcinoma. The lesion was excised. It was decided to avoid a skin graft as it would leave an area of hair loss. I elected to perform a single rotation flap as per the figures . The biomechanics and planning of a single rotation flap are discussed.\n删除3：<u>Figure 4.1\n\n【20】Single rotation flap plan\n</u>删除3：<u>Figure 4.2\n\n【21】Single rotation flap sutures in place\n</u>删除3：<u>Figure 4.3\n\n【22】Single rotation flap post op\n</u>\nCase Study 2\n\n【23】A 65 year old lady was referred to my clinic with a large 3 cm basal cell carcinoma on her scalp. A skin graft would had left her with a 3 cm area of hair loss. A skin graft would also result in a color-mismatched contour defect. It was not possible to close this defect primarily. I elected to use a double rotation flap (O to S flap) as the biomechanics and line of closure would not distort the hair pattern at the vertex and also allow for a smaller area of mobilization than if I had used a single rotation flap. The planning and biomechanics of the double-rotation flap is discussed .\n删除3：<u>Figure 4.4\n\n【24】Double rotation flap plan\n</u>删除3：<u>Figure 4.5\n\n【25】Double rotation flap sutured in place\n</u>\nCase Study 3\n\n【26】A 60-year old bald gentleman was referred with a large 3.5 cm exophytic lesion on his scalp which turned out to be a squamous cell carcinoma. Options of closure in this case involved a skin graft (given the gentleman was already bald), a single or double rotation flap. On examination of the scalp, due to previous radiotherapy to the scalp (not close to the present lesion) there was limited mobility to allow for a rotation arc of a single rotation flap. While, the O to S (double rotation flap) was also an option, I elected to use a tripolar-rotation flap given the location of the lesion at the vertex of the scalp. I have found this particularly useful on the vertex of the scalp where dissection of each of the pedicles is begun at 3, 7 and 11 O’clock positions. The planning of this flap is discussed. Unlike a ‘Mercedes Flap’ this flap is more a rotation than an advancement flap . While there was some bruising of the flap at the end of surgery the flaps remained fully viable with no tip necrosis or need for any further dressings or procedure.\n删除3：<u>Figure 4.6\n\n【27】Triple rotation flap plan\n</u>删除3：<u>Figure 4.7\n\n【28】Triple rotation flap sutured in place. The bruising was temporary and flaps remained fully viable\n</u>\nThe Single-Rotation Flap\n------------------------\n\n【29】The classical rotation flap is pivoted around a fixed point at the base of the flap and rotated along an arc toward the defect .\n删除3：<u>Figure 4.8</u>\n\n【30】Rotation flap\n\n【31】Classically, rotation flaps are designed to move along an arc of 30° or less with the radius approximately two to three times the diameter of the defect and the arc length approximately four to five times the width of the defect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【32】Larrabee conducted a series of elegant experiments 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> to test the tension and closure lengths of rotation flaps. He created a series of single rotation flaps. The variables he measured included the radius of each semicircle, the size of the defect, and the amount of undermining that was needed to close the defect using the flap. He also measured the force needed to close the defect at each stage i.e. no flap (primary closure), 45° flap, 90° flap, 135° flap and 180° rotation flaps. What he found was that tension was concentrated at 90° and 135°. In other words, extending the semicircle of the flap beyond 135 ° did not allow for easier closure , although sometimes there were cosmetic indications for doing so .\n删除3：<u>Figure 4.9</u>\n\n【33】Rotation flap biomechanics\n\n【34】In another series of experiments, Throckmorton 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> and others studied the relationship between the length of the incision and the amount of linear movement required to cover a defect using a rotation flap by trigonometric analysis. Their analyses showed the amount of flap stretch required to close defects, assuming a 2-dimensional surface and uniform ‘deformation’ of the flap during rotation. They found that for any incision longer than twice the diameter of the defect, the linear distance that the flap must be rotated ends up between 1.0 and 1.5 times the diameter of the defect.\n\n【35】They concluded that extending the incision beyond twice the diameter of the defect produces only a small decrease in the required linear movement of the flap and a small decrease in tension . Therefore there is little benefit in extending the incision. I usually remove the lesion with adequate margins and do not create a triangle as advocated in the classical rotation flap design. After the flap is rotated, I simply remove the dog-ear at the end.\n\n【36】Throckmorton’s trigonometric analyses suggest that a ratio of 1.6:1 represents the ideal proportions of flap length to defect diameter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. However, the effect of altering the curvilinear ‘releasing’ incision was not addressed by their mathematical model. We have already discussed that the arc of closure is usually four to five times the width of the defect and this seems to be the norm. When it comes to the scalp, the single rotation flap usually faces antero-posteriorly.\n\n【37】The Double-Rotation Flap or the O-to-S Flap\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【38】The ‘O to S’ flap may appear like a single rotation flap performed on two fronts , but biomechanically it is a different flap. The fundamental necessity to perform this flap is the availability of lax tissue on opposing sides of the defect  Therefore each flap is rotated and fixed at about half of a hemi-circle i.e. 90°. Because the final shape ends up as a zigzag resembling a ‘S’ or ‘Z’ shape, this flap is variably referred to as an O-to-Z or O-to-S flap. While the two flaps are identical and opposite to each other, this design tolerates some discrepancies in size and therefore allowances can be made to fit the flap in with sub-units or contours of the face. For an anterior scalp defect, for example, it is often necessary to extend the scalp flap incision further than the forehead/temple to achieve equivalent mobility of the inelastic scalp tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n删除3：<u>Figure 4.10\n\n【39】O to S flap\n</u>删除3：<u>Figure 4.11\n\n【40】O to S flap\n</u>\nBuckhingham 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> and colleagues undertook a series of cadaver experiments to study the biomechanics of the O-to-S flap. They drew concentric circles and measured flap angles as well as lengths by increasing lengths to 2, 3, 4 and 5 radii. They found that optimal design is achieved by selecting a starting-point of the flap (on the defect) and creating a curvilinear flap with points 45° from each other at 2, 3, and 5 radii. However, their experiments came up with an important finding: While 45° is the optimal angle for these flaps, undermining alone confers no advantage to decrease closing tension without accompanying flap incision, and incising the flap farther than 4 radii did significantly reduce the closing tension in this study . Therefore, they concluded that flap lengthening or increased undermining beyond 4 radii did not confer any advantage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n删除3：<u>Figure 4.12\n\n【41】O to S flap biomechanics\n</u>\nThe Triple or Tri-polar Rotation Flap\n-------------------------------------\n\n【42】While using multiple flaps is often needed on the scalp after cutaneous surgery for skin cancer, these techniques were first popularized by wartime surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. On the basis of the original three-legged incision introduced by Cushing, Gillies described the curved tripod, also known as the Isle of Man flap, due to its similarity to the Viking sun symbol on the Isle of Man crest. This was the forerunner of the triple rotation flap of the scalp 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【43】A crude way to understand the biomechanics of a triple rotation flap is to consider the purse-string suture. Many authors have advocated undermining and the use of a purse-string suture to close circular cutaneous defects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 \\]</u>. Indeed, circular defects are quite common on the scalp after excision of skin cancers. However, the purse-string suture is rarely used because the skin of the scalp is not as easy to mobilize in a circular fashion, as tension lines tend to run horizontally. Further, attempting such closure may not only cause puckering and buckling of the skin, but also results in poor scarring or wound breakdown 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. A modification of the purse-string principle and the rotational elements of the ‘Isle of Man’ flap led to the original ‘Mercedes’ flap (named because the design is similar to the insignia of the vehicle) – in this, three points are chosen around the defect depending on the direction or length needed for the three ‘arms’ of this formation. Three flaps are then ‘advanced’ (rather than rotated) as indicated in the illustration .\n删除3：<u>Figure 4.13</u>\n\n【44】Tripolar advancement flap\n\n【45】When the tripolar flap is planned using triple rotational flaps, the resulting closure ends up like a pin-wheel or the closure of a traditional camera lens. In a review of the triple rotation flap, the authors concluded that the triple rotation flap appears to serve best the essential purpose of immediate expedient coverage of the defect and primary closure of the donor area, permitting distribution of tension over the surrounding scalp away from the suture lines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>.\n\n【46】When I utilize this flap for scalp defects after skin cancer surgery, I reserve this flap for vertex of the scalp defects. Given hair follicles tend to form a ‘whorl’ here, it is easy to orientate the flap antero-posteriorly at the 3, 7 and 11 O’clock positions at the vertex of the scalp \n\n【47】In conclusion, scalp rotational flaps are extremely useful in closing circular defects of the scalp >2 cm after excision of skin cancers and are a superior alternative to skin grafts – as they avoid creating areas of alopecia and do not leave a contour defect as split-skin grafts tend to do. However, single, double and triple rotational flaps have different geometry and biomechanics and it is therefore useful to revisit their general principles as I have done here. Closing the scalp without tension is important as tight closures in the scalp can lead to necrosis and skin loss which may in turn lead to more complicated bare-bone defects.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Approxi-mately 15% to 25% of dyspepsia is caused by peptic ulcer disease， while 70% is attributable to functional (nonulcer) dyspepsia， or dyspepsia without an identifi-able organic cause. Reflux esophagitis accounts for 5%to 15% of cases of dyspepsia，**\n\n| **Table 47-1·“ALARMSYMPTOMS FOR WHICH EARLYUPPER GIENDOS-**  |\n| --- |\n| **COPY IS RECOMMENDED**  |\n| **Unintentional weight loss** **Progressive dysphagia** **Recurrent/persistent vomiting** **Odynophagia** **Unexplained anemia** **Gastrointestinal bleeding/hematemesis** **Family history ofcancer， specifically upper GI cancer** **History of gastric surgery** **Jaundice**  |\n\nwhile gastric or esophageal cancer are found in fewer than 2% of cases. Peptic ulcer disease is a condition of the gastrointestinal tract characterized by mucosal dam-age (eg， from NSAIDs or aspirin)， then chronic exposure of the damaged mucosa to pepsin and gastric acid secretion. It usually occurs in the stomach and proximal duodenum. Less commonly， it occurs in the lower esophagus， the distal duodenum， or the jejunum， as in unopposed hypersecretory states including Z ollinger-Ellison syndrome， with hiatal hernias (Cameron ulcers)， or in ectopic gastric mucosa (eg， Meckel diverticulum). Symptoms of functional dyspepsia are essentially the same as those of PUD， with no evidence of structural disease to explain the symptoms， thus it is a diagnosis of exclusion.Diagnostic endoscopy should be considered for patients with new-onset dyspepsia older than age 50 or who have symptoms that may be associated with upper GI malig-nancy . The cutoff age may be more appropriate at 40 or 45 for Asian or African-American patients. For persons younger than age 50 and without alarm symptoms， testing for H pylori via immunoglobulin G (IgG) serology， rather than the 13-C urea breath test or stool antigen as initial testing， is recommended due to low cost and ease of collection. For those who test positive， treating the H pylori infection via combination antibiotic and acid-suppression therapy is indicated. For persons who test negative， empiric therapy with a PPI for 4 to 8 weeks is a cost-effective intervention. Endoscopy or reconsideration of the diagnosis should be con-sidered for those who continue to be symptomatic following these interventions.**PUD is a term generally used to describe both duodenal and gastric ulcers. Duo-denal ulcers are more prevalent overall， whereas gastric ulcers are more common in NSAID users. Risk factors for the development of PUD include H pylori infec-tion， the use of NSAIDs and aspirin， cigarette smoking， alcohol consumption and personal or family history of PUD. Black and Hispanic populations have a higher likelihood of developing PUD as well. The lifetime risk of developing PUD in the United States is approximately 10%.Table 47-2 summarizes other causes ofPUD.**| **Table 47-2·CAUSES OF PEPTIC ULCERS**  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Causes**  | **Etiology**  | **Comments**  |\n| **Common causes**  | **Helicobacter pyloriinfection** **NSAIDs**  | **Gram-negative， motile spiral rod found in 48%** **of patients with peptic ulcer disease5% to 20% ofpatients who use NSAIDs overlong periods develop peptic ulcer diseaseNSAID-induced ulcers and complications aremore common in the elderly， those withconcomitant Hpylori infection， or those on** **steroids or anticoagulants**  |\n| **Other/rare causes**  | **Other medications** **Acid-hypersecretorystates/gastrinomas(eg，Zollinger-Ellisonsyndrome)Malignancy** **Stress**  | **Steroids， bisphosphonates，potassium chloride，chemotherapeutic agents (eg， intravenousfluorouracil)** **Multiple gastroduodenal，jejunal， or esophagealulcers that are difficult to heal** **Gastric cancer，lymphomas， lung cancersAfter acute illness， multiorgan failure， ventilatorsupport， extensive burns (Curling ulcer)， or** **head injury (Cushing ulcer)**  |\n\n【12】**Data from Kurata JH， Nogawa AN.

Most patients with dyspepsia and GERD will have unremark-able abdominal examinations， while PUD may only have the examination finding of mild-to-moderate epigastric tenderness. The presence of GI bleeding may be documented by fecal occult blood testing； however， the bleeding from PUD may be episodic and a single negative fecal occult blood test does not completely rule out an upper gastrointestinal bleed. Signs of anemia (eg， pale conjunctiva and skin， tachycardia，orthostatic hypotension) should be evaluated and treated according to severity and underlying risk factors. If a patient with known coronary artery disease becomes symptomatic and has a hemoglobin level less than 7 g/dL， then blood transfusion should be considered.****H pylori is a corkscrew-shaped gram-negative bacillus that is the causative agent of most non-NSAID-related ulcers， and is associated with the development of gastric cancer. The presence of the organism is associated with a five to seven times increased risk of the development of PUD. H pylori infection is commonly acquired during childhood and is more common in developing countries. Serologic testing for anti-H pylori antibodies (eg，IgG，IgM) is inexpensive， noninvasive， readily available， and is the first test that should be performed in a previously uninvestigated patient. It is a highly sensitive and specific test， yet cannot distinguish an active infection from a treated infection. Once the test is positive， it will almost always stay positive and should not be repeated. Stool antigen testing， has an excellent positive predictive value and is most often used 8 to 14 weeks posttreatment to test for eradication in cases suspected refractory to treatment. For this test to be most accurate， patients must not have been treated with PPIs for at least 2 weeks prior to stool collection. Active H pylori infection can be confirmed by 13-C urea breath testing. This test is performed by having the patient ingest a carbon-labeled urea compound， which is then metabolized by urease from the H pylori organism. The labeled CO， released by this process is measured in exhaled breath. This test is highly sensitive and spe-cific， is the most expensive option， and should be reserved for patients who have been treated and with inconclusive stool antigen testing.****Approximately 25% of patients with PUD have a serious complication such as hemorrhage， perforation， or gastric outlet obstruction. Silent ulcers and complica-tions are more common in older patients and in patients taking chronic NSAIDs and aspirin.**\n\n【14】**Clinically relevant upper gastrointestinal bleeding occurs in 15% to 20% of patients with PUD， is the most common indication for surgical intervention， and is the most common cause of death. The risk of rebleeding in PUD is the greatest within 48 hours of initial bleed and the risk of death increases proportionally with advanced age， medical comorbidities， and hemodynamic status.****Up to 40% of patients with chronic GERD will experience heartburn and regurgi-tation on a monthly basis. Most patients with GERD will have nonerosive reflux disease (NERD)， while others will progress to erosive esophagitis. Caucasian men aged 45 or greater who have chronic GERD， smoke cigarettes， and drink alcohol are at the greatest risk of development of Barrett esophagus， which is a precursor for esophageal adenocarcinoma. Patients with Barrett esophagus should be placed on lifelong PPI therapy and should undergo surveillance upper endoscopy to monitor for the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma.**A CBC should be obtained to determine a baseline hemoglobin value and should be repeated every 6 to 8 hours to monitor for anemia and gastrointestinal blood loss， even in the setting of negative fecal occult blood. Liver transaminases and serum amylase and lipase levels should be obtained when biliary or pancreatic dis-ease is suspected. An electrocardiography (ECG) should be performed upon ini-tial evaluation to rule out cardiac ischemia， since upper abdominal pain can be an atypical sign of acute coronary syndrome. A chest x-ray should be obtained to rule out abdominal visceral perforation， characterized by free air under the diaphragm. Abdominal ultrasonography is indicated when cholecystitis is suspected. A preg-nancy test should be obtained on all reproductive-age women， and endocervical cultures obtained when suspicion of pelvic inflammatory disease is high. Patients with significant anemia， hemodynamic instability (eg， hypotension， tachycardia， orthostasis)， or a suspected acute abdomen should be immediately hospitalized. Urgent surgical evaluation should be obtained if an acute abdomen is present.\n\n【15】**Dyspepsia in patients younger than age 50 with no alarm symptoms can be man-aged with a noninvasive H pylori \"test-and-treat”protocol with serologic testing followed by acid suppression using a PPI if symptoms remain. A negative test rules out H pylori infection in dyspeptic patients. If positive， appropriate treatment to eradicate the infection， along with a PPI to suppress acid production， should be prescribed .****Patients who experience classic GERD symptoms often begin self-directed acid-suppressive therapy with either an H， antagonist or a PPI. Over-the-counter for-mulations of these medications have a 2-week limit on therapy， then physician con-sultation is advised. The“test and treat\"strategy for GERD posits starting with the lowest possible dose of an H， antagonist once daily to control symptoms， then increasing frequency and potency to a PPI if symptoms are not adequately con-trolled (step-up therapy). If a patient is on chronic PPI therapy they should be‘stepped down\"to an H， antagonist if possible.**\n\n| **Table 47-3·HELICOBACTER PYLORI TREATMENT REGIMENS**  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Drug**  | **Dose**  |\n| **Triple Therapy (7-14 days)**  |  |\n| **Bismuth subsalicylate plus** **Metronidazole plus** **Tetracycline**  | **2 tabs QID** **250 mg QID** **500 mg QID**  |\n| **Ranitidine bismuth citrate plusTetracycline plus** **Clarithromycin or metronidazole**  | **400 mg BID** **500mgBBID** **500 mg BID**  |\n| **Omeprazole (or lansoprazole)plusClarithromycin plus** **Amoxicillin or** **Metronidazole (in penicillin-allergic patients)**  | **20 mg BID (30 mg BID)** **250 or 500 mg BID1g BID** **500 mg BID**  |\n| **Quadruple Therapy (10-14 days)**  |  |\n| **Omeprazole (or lansoprazole)** **Bismuth subsalicylate plus** **Metronidazole plus** **Tetracycline**  | **20 mg (30 mg)daily525 mg QID** **250 mg QID** **500 mg QID**  |\n\n【17】**Data from Del Valle J.

Patients with heart-burn or regurgitation should be advised to avoid smoking， alcohol， spicy foods， cit-rus foods， fatty foods， large meals， fatty meals， chocolate， peppermint， and should avoid eating or drinking 3 to 4 hours prior to recumbency.

Those with no evidence of active infection can be treated with acid suppression alone for 4 to 8 weeks. If symptoms resolve， no fur-ther testing is indicated. Along with treatment， offending agents， such as NSAIDs and tobacco， should be discontinued. Most patients with H pylori infection who have been treated successfully will require chronic acid suppressive therapy to com-bat symptoms of dyspepsia. Chronic acid suppressive therapy with PPIs has been associated with increased risk of community-acquired pneumonia； Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea； demineralization of bone； and decreased absorption of calcium， magnesium， and iron.**\n\n【20】**Patients older than age 50 or those with alarm symptoms for either PUD or GERD should be referred for upper GI endoscopy to exclude complications of esophageal stricture， erosive disease， or malignancy. Endoscopy is preferred over radiographic procedures such as barium esophagram due to direct visualization and the ability to perform biopsy. Endoscopy also can be therapeutic， as a stric-ture could be readily dilated， and a visible source of bleeding can be identified and**\n\n【21】**cauterized. Any patient 50 years or older who has hematemesis， hematochezia， or melena should undergo a colonoscopy regardless of the upper endoscopic findings， to evaluate for a lower gastrointestinal cause of bleeding including diverticulosis， vascular malformation， or malignancy.****See Case 23 (Lower GI Bleeding) and Case 40 (Irritable Bowel Syndrome).**", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The only abnormalities you note are a positive straight leg raise test, with raising the right leg eliciting more pain than the left. Her strength, sensation, and deep tendon reflexes in all extremities are normal.\n\n【3】 What is your diagnosis?\n\n【4】 What is your next step?\n\n【5】### ANSWERS TO CASE 24:\n\n【6】#### Low Back Pain\n\n【7】_Summary:_ An obese 35-year-old woman with acute worsening of chronic low back pain complains of shooting pain down her right leg. Her physical examination is normal.\n\n【8】 Most likely diagnosis: Musculoskeletal low back pain, possible sciatica without neurologic deficits.\n\n【9】 Next step: Encourage continuation of usual activity, avoiding twisting motions or heavy lifting. Use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on a scheduled basis; you can also recommend muscle relaxants, although these drugs may cause sleepiness. Massage or physical therapy might be helpful. Follow-up in 4 weeks. Long-term advice includes weight loss and back-strengthening exercises.\n\n【10】#### ANALYSIS\n\n【11】##### _Objectives_\n\n【12】1\\. Learn the history and physical examination findings that help to distinguish benign musculoskeletal low back pain from more serious causes of low back pain.\n\n【13】2\\. Understand the variety of treatment options and their effectiveness in low back pain.\n\n【14】3\\. Learn the judicious use of laboratory and imaging tests in evaluating low back pain.\n\n【15】##### _Considerations_\n\n【16】This young patient with chronic back pain has an acute exacerbation with pain radiating down her leg, which may indicate possible sciatic nerve compression. She has no other neurologic abnormalities, such as sensory deficits, motor weakness, or “red flag” symptoms of more serious etiologies of back pain, which if present would demand a more urgent evaluation. Thus, this individual has a good prognosis for recovery with conservative therapy, perhaps time being the most important factor. If she does not improve after 6 weeks, then imaging studies can be considered.\n\n【17】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【18】#### Low Back Pain\n\n【19】#### DEFINITIONS\n\n【20】CAUDA EQUINA SYNDROME: Lower back pain, saddle anesthesia, and bowel or bladder dysfunction with possible lower extremity weakness and loss of reflexes caused by compression of multiple sacral nerve roots. Cauda equina syndrome is a surgical emergency.\n\n【21】SCIATICA: Pain in the distribution of the lumbar or sacral nerve roots, with or without motor or sensory deficits.\n\n【22】SPONDYLOLISTHESIS: Anterior displacement of an upper vertebral body on the lower body, which can cause symptoms and signs of spinal stenosis. This condition can result from spondylolysis or from degenerative disk disease in the elderly.\n\n【23】SPONDYLOLYSIS: Defect in the pars interarticularis, either congenital or secondary to a stress fracture, leading to lower back pain, back muscle spasms, or no symptoms.\n\n【24】#### CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【25】Low back pain is experienced by two-thirds of all adults at some point in their lives. Approximately 2% of adults miss work each year because of low back pain. This complaint is most common in adults in their working years, usually affecting patients between 30 and 60 years of age. Although it is common in workers required to perform lifting and twisting, it is also a common complaint in those who sit or stand for prolonged periods. Low back pain is a recurrent disease that tends to be mild in younger patients, often resolving within 2 weeks, but can be more severe and prolonged as the patient ages. It is one of the most common reasons for young adults to seek medical care, second only to upper respiratory infections, and millions of healthcare dollars are expended on this problem each year. In evaluating patients with low back pain, the clinician needs to exclude potentially serious conditions, such as malignancy, infection , and dangerous neurologic processes, such as spinal cord compression or cauda equina syndrome . Individuals without these conditions are initially managed with conservative therapy. Nearly all patients recover spontaneously within 4 to 6 weeks; only 3% to 5% remain disabled for more than 3 months. If patients do not improve within 4 weeks with conservative management, they should undergo further evaluation to rule out systemic or rheumatic disease and to clarify the anatomic cause, especially patients with localized pain, nocturnal pain, or sciatica.\n\n【26】The potential causes of back pain are numerous . Pain can emanate from the bones, ligaments, muscles, or nerves. Rarely, it can be a result of referred pain from a visceral organ or other structure. Back pain with radiation down the back of the leg suggests sciatic nerve root compression , generally caused by a herniated intervertebral disk at the L4-L5 or L5-S1 level. Patients typically report aching pain in the buttock and paresthesias radiating into the posterior thigh and calf or lateral foreleg. When pain radiates below the knee, it is more likely to indicate a true radiculopathy than radiation only to the posterior thigh. A history of persistent leg numbness or weakness further increases the likelihood of neurologic involvement.\n删除4：<u>Table 24–1 • ETIOLOGIES OF LOW BACK PAIN</u>\n\n【27】Most cases of back pain are idiopathic, and this group, in general, is referred to as musculoskeletal low back pain. Imaging studies and other diagnostic tests are generally not helpful in managing these cases. Studies show that the history and physical examination can help separate the majority of patients with simple and self-limited musculoskeletal back pain from the minority with more serious underlying causes. Finding “red flag” symptoms can help the physician use diagnostic tests in a more judicious manner . Malignancy should be considered in patients with systemic symptoms and who have pain at night or pain that is not relieved by lying in a supine position. Primary cancers that commonly metastasize to the spine include lung, breast, prostate, lymphoma, and gastrointestinal (GI) tumors and melanoma . Multiple myeloma is a plasma cell neoplasm that can present with bone pain, renal failure, and anemia . When the patient has worrisome symptoms or signs, in most cases, the most effective initial evaluation is plain anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the involved area of the spine, a sedimentation rate, and a complete blood count. More expensive tests, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), should be reserved for those patients for whom surgery is being considered, because it is not required to make most diagnoses.\n\n【28】Table 24–2 “RED FLAG” SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF LOW BACK PAIN\n\n【29】New onset of pain in a patient older than 50 y or younger than 20 y\n\n【30】Fever\n\n【31】Unintentional weight loss\n\n【32】Severe nighttime pain or pain that is worse in the supine position\n\n【33】Bowel or bladder incontinence\n\n【34】History of cancer\n\n【35】Immunosuppression (chemotherapy or HIV)\n\n【36】Saddle anesthesia\n\n【37】Major motor weakness\n\n【38】It is rare that the patient can recall a precipitating event. Patients often have a history of recurrent episodes of low back pain. Psychological causes have not been consistently related to low back pain; however, there does seem to be an association with job satisfaction. During the physical examination, palpable point tenderness over the spinous processes may indicate a destructive lesion of the spine itself; in contrast, those with musculoskeletal back pain most often have tenderness in the muscular paraspinal area. Strength, sensation, and reflexes should be assessed, especially in those with complaints of radicular or radiating pain. Straight leg raise testing , in which the examiner holds the patient’s ankle and passively elevates the patient’s leg to 45°, is helpful if it elicits pain in the lower back suggesting nerve root compression. However, it is not a very sensitive or specific test . The Patrick maneuver, in which the patient externally rotates the hip, flexes the knee, and crosses the knee of the other leg with the ankle (like a number 4) while the examiner simultaneously presses down on the flexed knee and the opposite side of the pelvis, can help distinguish pain emanating from the sacroiliac joint.\n\n【39】In treating idiopathic low back pain, various modalities have been shown to be equally effective in the long run. Randomized, controlled trials have shown that encouraging the patient to continue his or her usual activity is superior to recommendations for bed rest . Patients without disability and without evidence of nerve root compression probably can maintain judicious activity rather than undergoing bed rest. Bed rest probably is appropriate only for individuals with severe pain or neurologic deficits. The patient should be instructed to position himself or herself so as to minimize pain; this usually consists of lying supine with the upper body slightly elevated and a pillow under the knees. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (on a scheduled rather than on an as-needed basis), nonaspirin analgesics, and muscle relaxants may help in the acute phase. Because most cases of disk herniation with radiculopathy resolve spontaneously within 4 to 6 weeks without surgery, these conservative measures are initial regimen recommended for these patients as well. Narcotic analgesics are also an option in cases of severe pain; however, because idiopathic low back pain is often a chronic problem, their prolonged use beyond the initial phase is discouraged. Chiropractic therapy, physical therapy, massage therapy, and acupuncture have been studied (in trials of varying quality), with results comparable to traditional approaches. Referral to a surgeon may be considered for those patients with radicular pain with or without neuropathy that does not resolve with 4 to 6 weeks of conservative management .\n\n【40】Patients with concerning clinical features, such as a history of malignancy, fever, or examination findings suggestive of spinal cord compression or cauda equina syndrome, should be referred for urgent imaging, either MRI or CT of the spine, to evaluate for conditions such as vertebral metastases, vertebral osteomyelitis, or spinal epidural abscess that require urgent treatment.\n\n【41】###", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Thirty hours after surgery, he was found to have a fever of 102°F (38.8°C), blood pressure of 90/60 mm Hg, heart rate of 140 beats/min, respirations of 24 breaths/min, and low urine output. Physical examination showed diffuse abdominal tenderness. The surgical site is clean and Gram stain did not show any organism. Urinalysis (UA) was negative and the complete blood count (CBC) showed leukocytosis. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient’s fever?\n\n【1】A. Pneumonia\n\n【2】B. Intraperitoneal leak from bowel injury\n\n【3】C. Surgical site infection\n\n【4】D. Deep tissue abscess\n\n【5】**Answer**: 38.1 B . In the presence of severe hemodynamic changes and diffuse abdominal tenderness, intraperitoneal leak is the most common cause of fever in the first 36 hours after laparotomy.\n\n【6】**Question**: 38.2 An 84-year-old nursing home resident underwent emergency open cholecystectomy under general anesthesia. She has advanced Parkinson disease, hypertension, and diabetes, and was receiving nutrition via nasogastric tube (NGT). On the second postoperative day, she was noted to be coughing and vomiting. Four days later, she had a temperature of 102°F (38.8°C), heart rate of 90 beats/min, respiratory rate of 25 breaths/min, blood pressure of 120/70 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation of 87% on room air. She had a productive cough with what the nursing staff describes as “putrid sputum.” Lung auscultation showed crackles on the right and a chest radiograph revealed a patchy infiltrate in the right lung. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\n【7】A. Obtain an expectorated sputum sample for culture.\n\n【8】B. Treat empirically with antibiotics.\n\n【9】C. Insert a nasogastric tube.\n\n【10】D. Treat with an H <sub>2 </sub> \\-receptor antagonist.\n\n【11】**Answer**: 38.2 B . This patient likely has aspiration pneumonia. She has risk factors including her age, functional status, recent general anesthesia, and advanced neurologic disease. She requires treatment with antibiotics which cover anaerobic bacteria. There is evidence that aspiration risk may be reduced by placing a nasogastric tube before surgery but long-term use actually predisposes a person to aspiration pneumonia. Giving the patient a histamine H <sub>2 </sub> \\-receptor antagonist may also decrease the risk of aspiration by decreasing gastric acid secretion. It is a preventative measure. Expectorated sputum is unreliable for anaerobic cultures because of likely contamination by oral flora.\n\n【12】**Question**: 38.3 A 42-year-old man underwent open reduction and internal fixation of a comminuted fracture of the right femur. He was doing well until the fifth postoperative day, when he complained of pleuritic chest pain and developed fever of 101°F (38.3°C), heart rate of 118 beats/min, respiration of 30 breaths/min, blood pressure of 130/85 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation of 85% on room air. His left ankle became edematous, warm, and tender. Which of the following is a risk factor for his condition?\n\n【13】A. Having an IV in his arm for more than 3 days\n\n【14】B. Failure to adequately use his incentive spirometer\n\n【15】C. Urinary bladder catheterization\n\n【16】D. Prolonged immobility\n\n【17】**Answer**: 38.3 D .

Her glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA <sub>1c </sub> ) prior to surgery was 10%. During postoperative follow-up a week after surgery, the surgical site was markedly erythematous, warm, and tender with pus. Which of the following is the next step in treatment?\n\n【19】A. Apply topical antibiotic to the surgical site.\n\n【20】B. Warm compresses alone will relieve the inflammation.\n\n【21】C. Open the surgical site and drain the infected material.\n\n【22】D.

This diabetic patient has evidence of microvascular disease， including peripheral neuropathy， and likely has autonomic dysfunction. Although this is the most likely etiology， one must be concerned about a possible cardiac issue since the patient has numerous cardiovascular risk factors； an evaluation should include an ECG. Answer A (carotid sinus hypersensitivity) is associ ated with fainting when wearing a tight collar or turning one's head.

Sam was informed that even though feeling scared or uncomfortable may be difficult, “red” behaviors (e.g. yelling, hitting, kicking, refusing to participate or follow directions) are not acceptable and that he would have to go to time-out if he displayed any of those behaviors during the session. The therapist used a stuffed animal to specifically describe to Sam the time-out procedure that had been taught to his parents. The therapist explained to Sam that he would never have to go to time-out for feeling nervous, scared, or uncomfortable as long as he displayed “brave, green” behaviors (e.g. stating that he feels upset, asking to take a few minutes to calm down or asking for help, taking a deep breath) and asked for confirmation of understanding of “green” and “red” behaviors, and associated rewards and consequences, prior to moving forward with the treatment.\n\n【5】For the second half of session 4, Sam and his parents participated together in Sam’s first ERP exercise. Techniques such as participant modeling and reinforced practice were used to help Sam accomplish each exposure task. Sam’s first listed item on his hierarchy was touching objects such as door handles and toys with the need to “even out” his touches. Sam was informed that, to help him feel less uncomfortable and anxious, he would be practicing experiencing these emotions a little at a time but not “matching” or “evening out” like he normally did, so that he would no longer feel the need to do so after a while. He was informed that he needed to earn three stickers to earn a prize and that each time he participated in an activity as requested by the therapist he would earn one sticker. The therapist then demonstrated for Sam what she would like him to do to earn the first sticker. She asked Sam to open the door to her office using only his right hand. She then opened the door using only her right hand and closed the door. Sam was very excited to earn his prize so he promptly went to the door, opened it only with his right hand, and shut the door, mimicking the therapist. The therapist then requested that Sam complete two similar, “uneven” tasks with his parents watching each task and the therapist demonstrating the task before Sam completed it. Sam was able to earn each of his three stickers and his prize for the first portion of the session. The therapist then provided a break for Sam and discussed with his parents any questions about the exposure activities. The exact protocol described herein was then repeated following the break for the last portion of the session, with Sam completing three short exposure activities (i.e. touching the couch with only one hand, picking up a toy with only one hand, playing with blocks with uneven touches for each hand) to earn three stickers and then a prize. Sam’s parents were asked to participate by serving as models during two of the three activities. Sam was able to earn both prizes (i.e. a small toy and playground time) during the session and did not require the time-out procedure. For homework, Sam and his parents were instructed to practice for at least 10 min a day completing the same exposure exercises completed in session at home using the same sticker/prize structure.\n\n【6】During session 5, the therapist chose a slightly more difficult set of activities to practice with Sam and his parents using ERP, participant modeling, and reinforced practice. The same protocol for ERP was utilized with Sam being told that he would need to complete three activities and earn three stickers for a prize. Sam was also reminded that “red” behaviors would require time-out. The therapist first asked Sam to place only his right hand on his right knee and to leave it there for 2 min. Sam was able to complete the activity and earn his sticker. During the second activity, however, when asked to tap only one foot (right foot), Sam began to perform his ritual of tapping his right and then left foot in even numbers (e.g. two taps, four taps). The therapist reminded Sam of the importance of practice and asked him to repeat the activity without the ritual. Sam began to cry and yell at the therapist that he would “not do it” and that he wanted to go home. The therapist provided one warning for Sam that he would have to go to time-out if he continued to have red behavior. When his mother stepped toward Sam to calm him, he reached out and struck her. The therapist instructed Sam’s mother to pick him up and take him to the time-out chair (already set up in the therapist’s office). Sam refused to sit in the chair and was then taken to the time-out room, per the time-out protocol. Sam was taken between the time-out chair and room several times before sitting in the time-out chair for the full allotted time. The total time of the time-out was approximately 35 min; however, Sam was eventually able to return to the ERP situation and complete the activity. Due to the lengthy time-out and the time constraints of the session, the third activity was not completed, and Sam did not earn his daily prize.\n\n【7】Sessions 6 through 8 followed a similar structure to sessions 4 and 5. During each session, the therapist set up ERP activities with increasing difficulty for Sam (e.g. using only one car door, changing goodbye and waving rituals, completing activities in uneven numbers; see Sam’s fear hierarchy). For each activity that Sam completed, he was able to earn a sticker and a number of predetermined stickers resulted in a prize. Typically, 2–3 prizes were provided per session, with prizes ranging from small toys, to games, to playground time, to preferred snacks. Sam had to go to time-out once more during sessions 6 through 8 (session 7) for refusing to complete an activity (i.e. starting a word ritual with his parents but allowing his parents not to repeat words as he requested) and throwing himself to the floor while yelling, “Repeat it! Repeat it!” Sam’s time-out lasted no more than 15 min during that session, and he was still able to complete all activities requested, including an additional activity, to earn enough stickers for a prize (no sticker was rewarded for completion of the activity during which the time-out occurred). In between each session, Sam’s parents were instructed to practice exposure activities mirroring those completed in session and to no longer avoid situations for activities that had already been practiced in session or engage in rituals that had been practiced/changed in session. At the end of session 8, Sam’s parents were informed that they would lead the remainder of the sessions with coaching from the therapist. They were instructed to begin thinking of activities taken from the mid- to upper-levels of Sam’s hierarchy to complete, beginning at the next session.\n\n【8】At the beginning of session 9, the therapist met with Sam’s mother alone (his father stayed with Sam in the waiting room) to discuss the session’s activities. Sam’s mother stated that she planned to have Sam walk down the hallway with an uneven number of steps and walk back to her with a different uneven number of steps. She described it as a game to see how many times he could go back and forth between his mother and father with uneven steps in 3 min. The therapist praised Sam’s mother for her creativity and provided a few adjustments including counting the steps out loud for accuracy, and having him do an even number once or twice to be sure the ritual does not change to uneven numbers only. Sam and his father then joined for the remainder of the session. Sam’s mother described the activity to Sam (who was excited for the game) and asked him to take his place in the hallway to begin the activity. The therapist prompted Sam’s mother to remember to set the reward and stickers in advance, coaching her to mirror the structure of the therapist-led sessions. Sam was able to complete the activity to earn his sticker. Following four stickers, he earned a reward and a break was provided. The therapist used the time in the break to provide praise to Sam’s mother for leading the exposures and to answer questions. After the break, Sam’s father was asked to lead three activities of his choice, which he completed successfully. Sessions 10 and 11 were structured similarly to session 9. Sam’s parents were asked to lead the exposures for Sam with therapist coaching. Sam engaged in anxious oppositional behavior during session 10, for which he required time-out. The time-out lasted 4–6 min and the time-out room was not required (i.e. Sam never left the time-out chair). It is also noted that activities for session 10 were exceptionally difficult for Sam (top of the hierarchy), including putting socks on only once and walking through doors only once. During session 11, Sam participated in high-level, difficult items from his hierarchy with great success and no instances of time-out needed. When queried by the therapist, Sam’s parents also reported that home behaviors had improved, with fewer instances and shorter duration of time-out, as well as minimal ritual participation or instances of matching behaviors.\n\n【9】Given Sam’s significant progress as well as his parents’ increased proficiency in parenting techniques and taking the lead for exposures, session 12 was set to be Sam’s graduation session. During session 12, the therapist reviewed Sam’s progress in session and at home, including all tasks mastered on his fear hierarchy and many of the “challenges” he conquered. The therapist also spent time reviewing Sam’s parents’ accomplishments with his parents and discussing relapse prevention strategies (e.g. continued practice at home, goals toward reduced accommodation). The possibility of booster sessions was also discussed and Sam’s parents were encouraged to call should any further questions arise. The therapist provided a graduation certificate for Sam and a final reward (i.e. playground time — Sam’s favorite).

The OCD and ADHD sections of the ADIS-IV-P were administered and Sam’s parents completed the CBCL and FAM. Sam’s parents endorsed a significant decrease in obsessive-compulsive symptoms with reduced anxiety, nearly-absent rituals, greater overall flexibility, and tantrum behaviors occurring less than once per week. His parents did, however, continue to report significant hyperactivity and impulsivity (e.g. jumping from one subject to another, interrupting, constantly “busy”) and some difficulty maintaining focus. Therefore, CSR ratings of 2 and 4 were given for OCD and ADHD-C, respectively. Further, observations of Sam’s behaviors in session were consistent with parent report of reduced overall obsessive-compulsive symptoms and ritualistic behavior. Sam no longer appeared to need to “match” every action and demonstrated greater flexibility and overall ability to participate in exposure activities. Therefore, a CGI-severity rating of 1 (“illness slight”) and a CGI-improvement rating of 6 (“very much improved”) were also given by the treating clinician. Sam also received a GAF rating of 75.\n\n【16】On the CBCL, Sam’s mother endorsed significant difficulties for the total problems scale ( T \\= 70), and externalizing scale ( T \\= 70); however, her ratings for the internalizing scale ( T \\= 55) were no longer significant. Specific items suggested that attention problems and hyperactivity remained problematic, but Sam no longer experienced significant difficulties in the areas of thought problems, anxiety, or oppositionality. Sam’s mother also endorsed a significant reduction in the amount of family accommodation present, with her ratings no longer reaching the clinical cutoff per the FAM. Overall, Sam appeared to demonstrate a significant reduction in OCD symptomology , no longer meeting criteria for a diagnosis of OCD following 12 sessions of behavioral therapeutic techniques, including participant modeling, reinforced practice, and ERP, along with parent training and integration of parent-led exposures into treatment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

It typically arises in lymph nodes.\n\n【9】**What is the typical cytogenetic change in this condition and what gene does it involve?**\n\n【10】All forms of Burkitt lymphoma involve the c-MYC gene found on chromosome 8. The characteristic translocation is t(8；14)， which places the c-MYC proto-oncogene adjacent to the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus on chromosome 14. This results in overexpression of c-MYC， a transcription factor that controls cellular metabolism， leading to increased cell growth. The tumor cells are typically CD20， CD10， and BCL-6positive.\n\n【11】**What is the appropriate treatment for this condition?**\n\n【12】Endemic Burkitt lymphoma is treated with chemotherapy， but HIV-associated and sporadic Burkitt are not necessarily as readily treatable. Both HIV-associated and sporadic cases also commonly metastasize to the central nervous system， requiring CNS radiation and intrathecal chemotherapy for control.\n\n【13】**What is tumor lysis syndrome?**\n\n【14】Tumor lysis syndrome is due to the large amount of neoplastic cell death during treatment with chemotherapy， typically seen in the most rapidly growing cancers， such as Burkitt lymphoma. Laboratory analysis shows multiple metabolic complications including hyperphosphatemia， hypocalcemia， hyperuricemia， and hyperkalemia leading to acute renal failure. Allopurinol or rasburicase， aggressive hydration， and diuresis can be used to prevent these consequences.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

GCA usually has its onset in patients age 50 or older and occurs in females more often than males. GCA involves inflammation of the medium- or large-size vessels. Her low-grade fever and gen-eralized body aches may represent polymyalgia rheumatica， which is often associ-ated with GCA. Other associated symptoms include jaw claudication and transient vision loss. Although GCA is not a common cause of headache， untreated patients can develop permanent vision loss resulting from ophthalmic artery involvement. Thus， a low index of suspicion is sufficient to begin investigation. The diagnosis could be suggested by an elevated ESR but can only be confirmed by temporal artery biopsy (ESR is a nonspecific marker of inflammation). However， a negative1 _._ biopsy does not entirely rule out the diagnosis of GCA. Based on the sampled area of the biopsy and due to the discontinuous involvement of arterial pathology， mul-tiple biopsies may be necessary to adequately assess the artery for disease. Indeed， if clinical suspicion is high， high-dose corticosteroids should be administered before the diagnosis is established to prevent irreversible complications.**\n\n【22】**APPROACHTO：**\n\n【23】**DEFINITIONS**\n\n【24】**BERRY ANEURYSM： A small， thin-walled protrusion from the intracranial arter-ies that has a \"berry\" appearance on angiographic imaging.

A study of alert and oriented patients presenting to the emergency center with a sudden-onset head-ache peaking in severity within 1 hour revealed 6% of patients had a subarachnoid**\n\n【36】**hemorrhage. The initial hemorrhage may be fatal， result in severe neurologic impairment， or produce only minor symptoms such as headache. Neurologic find-ings may not be present initially， and the patient who will benefit the most from intervention will often have mild symptoms； thus， it is important to diagnose sub-arachnoid hemorrhage early if it is suspected.**\n\n【37】**The best first diagnostic study is a noncontrast computed tomographic (CT) scan with thin imaging cuts at the brain base. If done within the first 6 hours of symptom onset， this diagnostic test will have nearly 100% sensitivity for subarachnoid hemor-rhage， which will then progressively decline over time. If hemorrhage is suspected but the CT is negative， lumbar puncture should be performed as soon as possible to assess for the presence of red cells or xanthochromia (yellowish discoloration of cerebrospinal fluid \\[CSF\\]). This finding indicates the presence of bilirubin in the CSF from the breakdown of hemoglobin released from lysed red blood cells and thus differentiates subarachnoid hemorrhage from a traumatic lumbar puncture.**\n\n【38】_Giant Cell Arteritis and Polymyalgia Rheumatica_\n\n【39】**GCA， also known as temporal arteritis， is a chronic vasculitis of large- and medium-size vessels usually involving the cranial branches of the arteries arising from the aortic arch. Suggestive signs and symptoms include new headache， abrupt onset of visual disturbances， jaw claudication， fever， anemia， or elevated ESR and/or CRP in a patient aged 50 years or older. GCA is closely related to polymyalgia rheumatica， an inflammatory condition characterized by bilateral aching and stiffness of the neck， torso， shoulders， or thighs， with a significantly elevated ESR. Both conditions probably are polygenic diseases in which various environmental and genetic factors influence susceptibility and severity. The most worrisome complication of GCA is permanent vision loss， which can occur as an early manifestation in up to 20% of patients. Temporal artery biopsy is recommended in all patients suspected of hav-ing GCA. Long segments (1-2 cm) of the artery may require excision to find the typical areas of segmental inflammation.**\n\n【40】**Corticosteroids are the drugs of choice to treat both polymyalgia rheumatica and GCA， with daily doses of 10 to 20 mg of prednisone for polymyalgia rheumatica and 40 to 60 mg for GCA. Steroids may prevent， but usually do not reverse， visual loss. Steroid dosage should be gradually tapered when discontinuing therapy；how-ever， relapse is common and should be suspected if symptoms return. It is also important to consider complications of corticosteroid therapy， including hypergly-cemia， bone loss， and neutropenia.**\n\n【41】_Migraine Headache_\n\n【42】**Migraine headache is the most common cause of clinic visits for headache because of its frequency， disabling qualities， and associated symptoms. Migraine headache is more common in women， and there may be a positive family history. Migraine head-aches present with a throbbing or pulsatile quality， are usually unilateral (although bilateral presentation does not exclude migraine)， and may have a preceding aura. Aura will typically present with temporary visual symptoms like bright shapes but can also present with auditory or somatosensory symptoms. Other associated symptoms include nausea， vomiting， or sensitivity to light or sound. Migraines can**\n\n【43】**also present with tearing or nasal congestion， which may be confused with sinus infection. Treatment of acute episodes involves the initial use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)， followed by triptans if symptoms persist. Preven-tive therapies include tricyclic antidepressants， beta-blockers， or anticonvulsants such as valproate or topiramate.**\n\n【44】**_Cluster and Tension Headaches_**\n\n【45】**Episodic cluster headache is much less common but is more easily diagnosed by its distinctive pattern. Cluster headaches are more common in men and are character-ized by periodic attacks of intense， unilateral， periorbital pain with nasal or ocular watering lasting minutes to hours but recurring daily over several weeks or months. Acute attacks can be treated with oxygen or subcutaneous sumatriptan. Verapamil is used for preventive therapy.**\n\n【46】**Tension headache is the most common type of headache. It is classically described as a bilateral\"band-like\" headache that is typically nonthrobbing and does not usu-ally have other associated symptoms like photophobia or phonophobia. Treatment includes NSAIDs or acetaminophen and identifying and preventing headache triggers.**\n\n【47】**CASE CORRELATION**\n\n【48】**●See also Case 36 (Transient Ischemic Attack)， Case 37 (Alzheimer Disease/Dementia)， and Case 43 (Meningitis， Bacterial).**", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The area has grown progressively over 2 years and has become increasingly tight, uncomfortable and pruritic. The area is hard, raised and erythematous with central scarring and atrophy 通用删除7(英):<u>( 27 )</u>. Her medical history is significant only for hypertension and osteoarthritis.\n\n【4】i. What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【5】ii. What are the potential complications of this disease?\n\n【6】iii. What are the treatment options?\n\n【7】Answer 27\n\n【8】i. Based on this patient’s clinical presentation, the most likely diagnosis is morphea, an inflammatory disease in the dermis and subcutaneous structures. The main variants include plaque-type, linear and generalized morphea.\n\n【9】The most common variant is plaque-type morphea, which is characterized by the development of erythematous to violaceous plaques that expand radially over several years with central sclerosis. The lesions are usually asymptomatic, but more advanced lesions can cause discomfort and skin tightness owing to the progressive scarring and induration of the skin. Although these lesions usually resolve spontaneously over a course of years, they can lead to permanent atrophy and changes in pigmentation. Relapsing disease is uncommon in plaque-type morphea.\n\n【10】Linear morphea is a clinical variant that often presents as a linear, inflammatory streak or an initial plaque-type lesion that extends longitudinally to form a scar band. One specific type of linear morphea is known as morphea _en coup de sabre,_ which refers to linear morphea of the forehead and scalp. Generalized morphea is a rare clinical variant that occurs when multiple plaque-type lesions arise at once and become confluent to involve almost all of the total body skin surface area.\n\n【11】ii. Morphea is a disease process that is localized to the skin and does not involve internal organs. However, in the linear morphea variant, the underlying fascia, muscle and bone can be involved, leading to impairment of mobility. High-risk areas are those overlying the joints, which can lead to joint immobility. Morphea _en coup de sabre_ can also involve underlying muscles and osseous structures and rarely progress to involve the eye, meninges, or brain. In the generalized form, the diffuse sclerosis can lead to vasoconstriction leading to symptoms such as difficulty breathing as a result of impaired thorax mobility and inflammation of the intercostal muscles.\n\n【12】iii. Although typical plaque-type morphea regresses spontaneously over several years, there are several treatment options available to expedite resolution. Phototherapy with UVA1 or bath PUVA therapy is efficacious in providing faster clinical improvement and longer periods of remission. For systemic treatments, immunosuppression with oral corticosteroids or methotrexate can be helpful during the acute inflammatory stages. There is some evidence supporting the efficacy of oral vitamin A derivatives such as etretinate or acitretin. Topical therapy plays a smaller role in the treatment of morphea. High-potency topical steroids, calcineurin inhibitors and vitamin D derivatives may help reduce local inflammation in acute lesions, but overall are ineffective by themselves in resolving the lesions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Increased anteroposterior diameter and prolonged expiration suggests the patient is suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Reduction of FEV1 , forced vital capacity (FVC), and the FEV1 :FVC ratio are the hallmark of airway obstruction. Total lung capacity (TLC) is increased due to lung hyperinflation, secondary to expiratory flow limitation.  \n\n【7】Answer A is incorrect. These changes are not consistent with either an obstructive or restrictive pattern. TLC will be increased in COPD.  \n\n【8】Answer C is incorrect. In restrictive lung conditions, there is a decrease in the lung’s ability to expand. The FVC is decreased more than the decrease in FEV1 ; therefore, the FEV1 : FVC ratio is normal or high. TLC is decreased because there is a loss of lung tissue elasticity.  \n\n【9】Answer D is incorrect. These changes are not consistent with either an obstructive or restrictive pattern.  \n\n【10】Answer E is incorrect.

The patient states that she has been having vivid nightmares and dreams for months and will often wake up screaming or falling out of bed. She was brought to the hospital because of “thrashing around” and screaming “Stop” as witnessed by her niece. Her niece also stated that her aunt had shown a decline for the past year. She was previously an outgoing, active person who lived independently. In the past 6 months, she has become more reclusive, and her son has had to take over her finances as a result of an accumulation of unpaid bills. She was recently placed on a psychotropic medication by her primary care physician a few months earlier with worsening of orientation. It was discontinued. The patient also admits to seeing “things” at night and will occasionally hear “things.” Neurologic examination is significant for mild bradykinesia, decreased right arm swing, and small stepped ambulation. There is also mild right arm rigidity without tremor. A neuropsychologic examination revealed changes in executive functioning (verbal fluency, attention, judgment) and difficulties performing previously learned tasks (dyspraxia).\n\n【3】 What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【4】 What is the next diagnostic step?\n\n【5】 What is the next step in therapy?\n\n【6】### ANSWERS TO CASE 21: Dementia (Lewy Body )\n\n【7】_Summary_ : The patient is a 64-year-old woman with progressive decline in personality, daily function, and depression. The patient’s history is also significant for sleep disorders, including dream stage disturbance and auditory and visual hallucinations. Her examination reveals impairment in the extrapyramidal system and subcortical and cortical cognitive dysfunction consistent with a parkinsonian syndrome with a dementia.\n\n【8】• Most likely diagnosis : Diffuse Lewy body dementia (DLBD)\n\n【9】• Next diagnostic step : MRI of brain; neuropsychologic evaluation\n\n【10】• Next step in therapy : Anticholinesterase medications\n\n【11】#### ANALYSIS\n\n【12】##### _Objectives_\n\n【13】1\\. Describe the typical presentation of DLBD.\n\n【14】2\\. Know the differential diagnosis of conditions with parkinsonism and dementia.\n\n【15】3\\. Understand the evaluation and management of Parkinson dementia syndromes.\n\n【16】##### _Considerations_\n\n【17】This is a woman who developed cognitive, behavioral, and motor dysfunction that is most likely caused by DLBD. Her history is significant for onset of cognitive and behavioral decline characterized by social isolation, inability to handle personal affairs, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep-related behavior disorders, and hallucinations. Dementia with LBD involves a predominant frontal lobe or executive dysfunction and motor parkinsonism , in addition to a number of core and suggestive features that include fluctuating cognition, hallucinations, sensitivity to neuroleptics, and sleep-related disorders. Based on the temporal progression of dementia and behavioral decline, then sleep-related disorders and parkinsonism, diffuse Lewy body disease is the likely diagnosis. Her examination is highly suggestive of parkinsonism characterized by a festinating (short, small steps), ipsilateral decreased arm swing, and rigidity. Formal testing confirmed dysfunction including impaired verbal fluency (word generation), concentration, judgment, and apraxia. Her history is also significant for clinical worsening with an empiric trial of a psychotropic, not otherwise specified.\n\n【18】For this case, other diagnostic considerations include Parkinson disease (PD) or its related disorders, Alzheimer disease (AD), CNS infections, or cerebrovascular disease. In contrast to DLBD, patients with Alzheimer dementia typically present with a primary cortical dementia with memory impairment as a predominant feature. Parkinsonian features are not uncommon in AD, but often will show in advanced disease when cognitive impairment is severe. In addition, AD patients can inadvertently be treated with antipsychotics for associated behavioral disturbances and develop drug-induced parkinsonism. With PD, patients will present with motor disturbances associated with degeneration of the extrapyramidal system (bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor). In PD, dementia can occur, but is predominantly subcortical (slowed thought processes, retrieval, attention, and concentration) and is usually not a predominant or early clinical feature of the disease.\n\n【19】CNS infections such as HIV encephalitis or chronic fungal meningitis can present with slowly progressive dementia and motor dysfunction. Often the dementia and motor dysfunction are more global and include multiple cortical and subcortical deficits, extrapyramidal and pyramidal dysfunction, and a more rapid clinical course. Normal pressure hydrocephalus and cerebrovascular disease (particularly ischemic disease of the deep white matter) typically present as what is called “lower body parkinsonism” with early gait and balance problems, lower body akinesia/bradykinesia, little or no tremor. Urinary abnormalities and the executive frontal lobe dysfunction are common. For both these disorders, neuroimaging often shows characteristic abnormalities.\n\n【20】### APPROACH TO: Diffuse Lewy Body Dementia\n\n【21】#### DEFINITIONS\n\n【22】APRAXIA : Inability to perform tasks or movements when asked, although the patient has normal comprehension, motor function, or has previously learned to perform the task. There are different types of apraxia including constructional apraxia (difficulty in performing tasks involved with construction, for example, drawing a five-pointed star) or ideomotor apraxia (disturbance of voluntary movement in which a person cannot translate an idea into movement).\n\n【23】EXECUTIVE FUNCTION : Mental capacity to control and plan mental skills, to sustain or flexibly direct attention, to self-inhibit inappropriate behavioral or emotional responses, to plan strategies for future behavior and initiate and execute these strategies, and to flexibly switch among problem-solving strategies. This higher order function is mediated by regions within the frontal lobes of the cerebral cortex.\n\n【24】REM-RELATED DISORDERS : A parasomnia involving dissociation of the characteristic stages of sleep. The major feature is loss of inhibition leading to a wide spectrum of behavioral release during sleep, that is, “acting out dreams” or seeing dream content upon going to sleep (hypogogic hallucinations) or waking up (hypnopompic hallucinations).\n\n【25】#### CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【26】Diffuse Lewy body dementia (DLBD) represents the third most common cause of dementia in developed countries in the Western hemisphere. It accounts for 10% to 20% of all dementias; however, the sensitivity and specificity of clinically diagnosing DLBD is poor because pathology and clinical features can overlap between DLBD and other dementias, such as Alzheimer disease (AD). In fact, 40% of AD patients have the pathologic alterations felt to be specific for DLBD, the Lewy body. Epidemiologic studies are limited but suggest that men are more affected than women, and the usual onset is in late fifties and older. Alzheimer is the most common cause of progressive dementia, and vascular dementia the second most common.\n\n【27】##### _Clinical History and Features_\n\n【28】DLBD is a progressive degenerative dementia but can overlap with other parkinsonian dementias and primary Alzheimer dementia, clinically and pathologically . However, when dementia precedes motor signs, particularly with visual hallucinations and episodes of reduced responsiveness, the diagnosis of DLBD should be considered. The following clinical features help distinguish DLBD from Alzheimer dementia: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> fluctuations in cognitive function with varying levels of alertness and attention, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> visual hallucinations, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> parkinsonian motor features that appear relatively early in DLBD.\n删除4：<u>Table 21–1 • DIAGNOSTIC FEATURES OF DEMENTIA WITH LEWY BODIES</u>\n\n【29】Cognitive impairment in DLBD is characterized by more executive dysfunction and visual–spatial impairment rather than the predominant memory loss of AD. It is not unusual for someone with DLBD to have a relative severe dementia by history, but to have relatively preserved memory with severe apraxia on examination. This combination is virtually never seen in AD. When parkinsonism precedes cognitive dysfunction by more than 2 years, the disorder is referred to as Parkinson disease dementia. Knowing this clinical presentation is useful to aid in diagnosis . Other suggestive features of DLBD are visual hallucinations, delusions, unexplained syncope, REM-sleep disorders, and sensitivity to dopamine antagonists, especially neuroleptic medications.\n删除4：<u>Table 21–2 • CLINICAL PHENOMENOLOGY OF DEMENTIA WITH LEWY BODIES</u>\n\n【30】##### _Pathology_\n\n【31】Frederick Lewy first described Lewy bodies (LBs) in 1914, which are cytoplasmic inclusions of the substantia nigra neurons in patients with idiopathic Parkinson disease. By the 1960s, pathologists described patients with dementia who had LBs of the neocortex. It was not until the mid-1980s, when sensitive immunocytochemical methods to identify LBs were developed; that dementia with LBs (DLB) was then recognized as being far more common than previously thought. However, there is considerable controversy at this point over whether DLB and PD are two different conditions or just part of a spectrum disorder with common underlying pathology. In 1990, alpha-synuclein was found as one of proteins of the Lewy body inclusion in autopsied brains of patients with DLBD, PD, and even AD (neuritic plaques). Thus, these disorders are often referred to as synucleinopathies.\n\n【32】##### _Diagnostic Studies_\n\n【33】Laboratory studies should include a thorough evaluation for treatable and reversible causes of dementia, including a chemistry panel, complete blood count (CBC), thyroid studies, vitamin B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> levels, syphilis serology, Lyme disease serology, or HIV testing, when appropriate.\n\n【34】Imaging studies are important to evaluate for other conditions that can mimic this disorder (vascular dementia, tumor, normal pressure hydrocephalus, etc). Patients with DLBD usually have less atrophy of the hippocampus than patients with AD (but more than control subjects). Whether this difference is clinically useful is under investigation, as is the diagnostic utility of functional imaging. Single-photon emission CT (SPECT) scanning or positron emission tomography (PET) scanning can show decreased occipital lobe blood flow or metabolism in DLB but not in AD. Reduced dopamine-transporter activity in the basal ganglia is seen with PET scanning or single-photon emission CT scanning.\n\n【35】##### _Other Tests_\n\n【36】In certain circumstances, neuropsychologic testing is helpful to differentiate DLB from AD and to establish a baseline for future comparison. Patients with DLB can have changes on electroencephalography earlier than patients with AD, but whether this difference is diagnostically useful is not clear. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination is not required in routine cases, but may be indicated if other alternative diagnoses are considered.\n\n【37】#### TREATMENT\n\n【38】There are no medications that have been shown to delay the degeneration of DLB . Symptomatically, the anticholinesterase medications (ie, rivastigmine, donepezil, and galanthamine) have benefit on cognitive and behavioral symptoms. A loss of neurons containing acetylcholine is associated with both DLBD and AD, but the cholinergic depletion in DLB is actually much more severe than AD and so appears to be more responsive to treatment. Cognitive and behavioral symptoms have been shown to improve with this class of medications, however, not depression. Neuroleptic agents should be used with extreme caution in these patients who have visual hallucinations or psychiatric manifestations . Patients often treated for behavioral issues with neuroleptics have been described to have disastrous responses to this class of medicines, even when using “atypical antipsychotics,” including severe drug-induced parkinsonism. For severe depression, serotonin reuptake inhibitors are indicated. Electroconvulsive therapy has been shown to be effective and safe in sensitive or severely depressed patients. In addition, parkinsonian motor signs may be treated with dopaminergic agents such as levodopa–carbidopa.\n\n【39】####", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Current rhGH treatment regimens utilize dose-titration strategies targeting serum IGF-I normalization to account for inter-individual differences in GH sensitivity that takes into consideration age, gender, BMI, and various other baseline characteristics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Because this patient has DM, initiating low doses of rhGH (0.2–0.3 mg a day) is recommended to minimize the risk of worsening glycemia. Side effects of rhGH therapy are the result of its fluid retentive effects (e.g. edema, arthralgia, myalgia, paresthesia and carpal tunnel syndrome) and are more often associated with higher doses that resolve after dose reductions or treatment cessation.\n\n【10】As this patient has TSH and ACTH deficiencies on hydrocortisone and levothyroxine replacement therapies, respectively, close monitoring of the adequacy of dosing of these medications should be undertaken while on rhGH therapy. Recombinant human GH decreases serum-free thyroxine (T <sub>4 </sub> ) and increases thyronine (T <sub>3 </sub> ) levels by increasing the extra-thyroidal conversion of T <sub>4 </sub> to T <sub>3 </sub> without altering TSH levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 27 \\]</u> and decreases serum cortisol levels by inhibiting the enzyme 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 causing a shift in cortisol metabolism favoring cortisone production 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 28 \\]</u>. Although these changes are relatively small and not clinically significant in most patients, occasionally the effects of rhGH on free T <sub>4 </sub> and cortisol may result in worsening of symptoms of hypothyroidism and hypoadrenalism. Regular monitoring of serum-free T <sub>4 </sub> levels during rhGH treatment and increments of his levothyroxine dose may be needed as necessary. This patient reported increasing fatigue that coincided with him forgetting to take his afternoon hydrocortisone dose suggesting hydrocortisone under-replacement that is further exacerbated by diminished tissue conversion of cortisone to cortisol by rhGH therapy. This patient needs to be educated on the importance of taking his afternoon dose of hydrocortisone, and increase the dose of hydrocortisone to 25 mg a day in divided doses to avoid symptoms of adrenal insufficiency.\n\n【11】During rhGH therapy , serum IGF-I, fasting glucose, hemoglobin A1c, fasting lipids, BMI, waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio need to be monitored at 6- to 12-month intervals, whereas assessment of QoL using the specific Quality of Life in Adult Growth Hormone Deficiency Assessment questionnaire and serum lipids can be assessed at 12-month intervals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Measurements of BMD at baseline should be undertaken and repeated at 2- to 3-yearly intervals to assess the need for additional bone treatment modalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Because this patient had a pituitary macroadenoma, periodic MRI scans are recommended while on rhGH therapy to monitor the size of his pituitary lesion post-operatively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】An important yet unresolved question is whether rhGH therapy should be continued throughout life. If benefits are achieved without any side effects, then continuing rhGH therapy indefinitely is reasonable. If there are neither subjective nor objective benefits of treatment after at least 18 months of treatment, discontinuing rhGH treatment can be discussed with this patient. If rhGH is discontinued, a 6-month follow-up visit with the patient is recommended because he might consider resuming rhGH replacement therapy, noting in retrospect that his QoL was better while on treatment.\n\n【13】The impact of rhGH therapy on conventional cardiovascular risk markers (e.g. dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance) has been extensively studied. Recombinant human GH replacement improves some cardiovascular risk markers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 29 – 31 \\]</u>, but long-term prospective controlled trials on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are still lacking. Standard lipid profiles improve with rhGH therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 32 \\]</u>, but data of rhGH therapy on risk of DM are mixed.

Evaluation of prospective studies indicated that shorter-term rhGH therapy negatively affected glucose homeostasis; paradoxically, low-dose rhGH replacement improved 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 35 \\]</u> or normalized insulin sensitivity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 36 \\]</u>. Overall, available data suggest that rhGH therapy does not worsen clinical glycemia, provided lower rhGH doses (≤0.3 mg/day) are used 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 35 , 37 , 38 \\]</u>. In this patient, if glycemia worsens during rhGH therapy, addition and/or adjustments of anti-diabetic medications and use of low-dose rhGH therapy (0.2–0.3 mg/day) could be considered. Alternatively, treatment initiation in this patient can be withheld to allow optimization of anti-diabetic therapy first.\n\n【14】Given the potential role of GH and IGF-I in cell proliferation, the long-term safety of rhGH replacement therapy has posed a theoretical concern of cancers and is well-studied in several recently published large epidemiological and post-marketing registry studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 39 , 40 \\]</u>. It is thus apparent that there is no clear evidence that rhGH therapy increases the risk of recurrence of intracranial tumors nor the risk of recurrence of the primary malignancy in childhood cancer survivors and incidence of malignant tumors in adults. There might be a slight excess risk of secondary neoplasms in those previously treated with irradiation therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 41 \\]</u>, but this risk decreases with increasing length of follow-up 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 42 \\]</u>. Data from large databases have provided further reassurance showing no increased risk of de novo cancers in rhGH-treated patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 43 \\]</u>. Due to this patient’s strong family history of cancer, the decision to treat with rhGH should be made with caution. Clearly, the beneficial effects of rhGH replacement need to be carefully balanced against the possible, yet unsubstantiated, cancer risk and morbidity of untreated adults with GHD. If rhGH therapy is commenced for this patient, continued long-term monitoring, including standard recommendations for cancer screening, needs to be performed, and treatment discontinued immediately if cancer is detected.\n\n【15】The use of rhGH as an anti-aging agent has attracted much publicity with claims about rhGH being an anti-aging remedy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 44 , 45 \\]</u>. No studies have assessed long-term (> 6 months) efficacy or safety of rhGH administration for this purpose. A meta-analysis evaluating varying doses and duration of rhGH therapy in healthy elderly subjects reported small changes in body composition but significant rates of adverse events 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 46 \\]</u>. Off-label distribution or marketing of rhGH in the United States to treat aging or aging-related conditions is illegal and punishable by imprisonment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 47 \\]</u>. Physicians and other health-care professionals must be aware that under no circumstances should rhGH be prescribed for anti-aging purposes.\n\n【16】Daily subcutaneous injections of rhGH frequently pose a barrier to initiating treatment or to treatment adherence that increases over time that compromises therapeutic efficacy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. Lower frequency dosing would be less burdensome to patients and may improve treatment adherence. Several LAGH preparations have been studied in recent years, and somapacitan (Novo Nordisk), demonstrating non-inferiority efficacy and safety to daily rhGH injections, was the first to be approved in the United States in August 2020 but as to when it will be commercially available remains unknown 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 48 \\]</u>. If cost is not an issue, it is likely that LAGH preparations will be a welcome addition to the management of adult GHD.\n\n【17】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【18】Diagnosis is often challenging, and the decision to test for adults with GHD should only be undertaken based on the clinical suspicion of the physician within an appropriate clinical context with reasonable probability of the disease and intention to treat. Frequently, GH stimulation test/s are required to confirm the diagnosis, but current available tests have several caveats . Because of the limitations of the ITT , the GST has been increasingly used. The recently FDA-approved oral macimorelin test appears promising because the test is easy to conduct with high reproducibility, safety, and diagnostic accuracy comparable to the ITT . Once adult GHD is confirmed, low rhGH doses should be initiated and up-titrated carefully to avoid over-treatment and side effects. Many factors influence rhGH therapy responsiveness, underlining the importance of a personalized approach to effectively manage these patients .\n\n【19】Table 19.3\n\n【20】General considerations for a personalized approach when managing adults with GHD\n\n| No.  | Considerations  |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1  | Only perform screening and diagnostic testing in patients with a suggestive history and in whom there is an intention to treat if the diagnosis is confirmed  |\n| 2  | Retest patients transitioning from pediatric to adult care, especially those with isolated idiopathic CO-GHD after at least 1 month following discontinuation of rhGH therapy, and minimize lengthy interruptions in rhGH therapy for those with confirmed GHD  |\n| 3  | Use low initial doses of rhGH in patients susceptible of side effects, e.g. elderly, obese patients, and patients with glucose intolerance  |\n| 4  | Use higher doses of rhGH in transition patients and females on oral estrogens  |\n| 5  | Avoid titrating rhGH doses to exceed IGF-I SDS > +2 for the age and sex of the patient  |\n| 6  | Monitor BMI, waist circumference, BMD, blood pressure, serum lipids, fasting glucose, hemoglobin A1c, and QoL periodically and after adjusting rhGH doses  |\n| 7  | In patients with a history of a lesion in the hypothalamic-pituitary region with or without surgery and/or radiation, periodically monitor the lesion by performing MRI scans  |\n| 8  | Assess, treat, and monitor for other pituitary hormone deficiencies  |\n| 9  | If benefits are achieved, continue rhGH therapy indefinitely, but if no apparent or objective treatment benefits are achieved after at least 12–18 months, can consider discontinuing rhGH therapy, and perform a 6-month follow-up appointment to re-assess patient’s desire to remain off therapy  |\n\n【22】Abbreviations: _BMD_ bone mineral density, _BMI_ body mass index, _CO-GHD_ childhood-onset growth hormone deficiency, _GHD_ growth hormone deficiency, _IGF-I SDS_ insulin-like growth factor-I standard deviation score, _MRI_ magnetic resonance imaging, _QoL_ quality of life, _rhGH_ recombinant human growth hormone\n\n【23】Over the past three decades, rhGH therapy in adults with GHD has been shown to improve body composition, exercise capacity, bone mineral density, and QoL. Most of the results of rhGH treatment are sustainable long term (10–15 years), and it appears to be safe regarding the incidence and mortality of malignancies and intra-cranial tumor recurrence. However, despite improving several cardiovascular risk markers, rhGH has not definitively proven to reverse the excess mortality associated with hypopituitarism. Although studies have shown the safety of rhGH use, its routine use in conception and pregnancy cannot be routinely advocated yet until further safety data involving larger patient numbers become available. Conversely, rhGH use for sports and anti-aging is strictly prohibited. Because non-adherence is common with daily rhGH injections, LAGH preparations may improve adherence and possibly therapeutic efficacy. After the FDA-approval of somapacitan in the United States, endocrinologists are encouraged to monitor future developments of LAGH preparations as it is anticipated that more will be approved in the near future.\n\n【24】Disclosure Statement\n\n【25】KCJY has received research grants to Barrow Neurological Institute for clinical research studies from Pfizer, Novo Nordisk, OPKO Biologics, Versartis, and Aeterna Zentaris and served on Advisory Boards for Pfizer, Novo Nordisk, Ipsen, and Strongbridge.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

She looks pale on arrival, with BP = 50/20 mmHg and a heart rate of 96 bpm.\n\n【2】Questions\n\n【3】1.  1.\n\n【4】    What do you think is going on? Why?\n\n【5】2.  2.\n\n【6】    Why did these findings become apparent now, and not earlier?\n\n【7】3.  3.\n\n【8】    Why do you think she is not tachycardic? Could this be anything else?\n\n【9】4.  4.\n\n【10】    She seems sleepy when you try to awaken her? What are you concerned about? What can you do?\n\n【11】Answers\n\n【12】1.  1.\n\n【13】    This patient has deficient intravascular volume. Significant blood loss is an expected part of scoliosis surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 – 18 \\]</u>. If we assume that the patient’s weight preoperatively was 50 kg, her calculated blood volume would be 3500 mL. Her EBL, therefore, is approximately one blood volume. The volume she has been transfused is approximately 800 mL autologous PRBC, 500 mL Cell Saver, and 2000 mL crystalloid. If we assume a one to one replacement of blood lost with PRBC and Cell Saver, those products have replaced approximately 1300 mL of her 3500 mL blood loss. She also was given approximately 2200–2500 mL of crystalloid as replacement for the approximately 2 liters of EBL not replenished by the blood products. Replenishment of intravascular volume lost from intraoperative bleeding with crystalloid is generally at a 3:1 ratio. In this case, then, adequate IV fluid replacement for the blood loss would be in the neighborhood of 6000 mL, not the 2000 given in the OR. The likely explanation for the pasty appearance and hypotension is inadequate preload.\n\n【14】2.  2.\n\n【15】    Once the surgery had been completed, there was much less stimulation, and the sympathetic tone that had been partially responsible (presumably) for BP maintenance has now greatly diminished.\n\n【16】3.  3.\n\n【17】    The hypotension is not accompanied by tachycardia as would be expected. There are several possible explanations for the low heart rate. The anesthetic may have included a significant dose of fentanyl, or, if induced hypotension was part of the technique, beta-blockers may have been given. Alternatively, it may be that, during the procedure, there was significant spinal cord ischemia that has led to loss of sympathetic tone as well as loss of the cardioaccelerator innervation of the heart. If there were abnormalities in the SSEP tracings during the case, this possibility should be given careful consideration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. In any case, the lack of a heart rate response to the inadequate preload is only worsening the clinical picture here and increasing the importance of rapid expansion of the intravascular volume 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】4.  4.\n\n【19】    Sleepiness can be the result of intraoperative medications , specifically opioids. Opioid effects include somnolence and depression of respiratory drive. If the ABG shows elevated PaCO <sub>2 </sub> opioid-induced depression of her respiratory drive must be considered. Whether or not to treat this with a reversal agent like naloxone depends upon the degree of hypercarbia. Naloxone administration in this setting must be undertaken carefully, starting with low doses. The starting dose of naloxone for respiratory depression in this case should be 1 mcg/kg IV with additional doses given as needed. An ABG taken at this point would likely show a metabolic acidosis. This is an urgent situation. The child may be at the limit of her ability to sustain an inadequate intravascular volume without suffering a cardiac or respiratory arrest. The ABG obtained will include a hemoglobin measurement, and that number will guide IV fluid therapy. Fluid resuscitation should begin immediately with available crystalloid. Once hemoglobin is available and colloid has become available, the specific fluid given can be tailored to the situation. Consideration should be given to measurement of central venous pressure if there is not a rapid improvement in the blood pressure once intravascular volume has been even partially replenished.\n\n【20】Case 4\n------\n\n【21】An 18-month-old underwent uneventful tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy for peripheral and central sleep apnea and received 3 mcg/kg fentanyl with a sevoflurane/oxygen/nitrous oxide anesthetic. He awakened in the OR, but now you are called to the bedside for periodic breathing, breath holding, and an O <sub>2 </sub> saturation of 86%.\n\n【22】Questions\n\n【23】1.  1.\n\n【24】    What might be going on?\n\n【25】2.  2.\n\n【26】    How does dexamethasone work to prevent postintubation edema? Is it effective if administered post hoc? What will you do?\n\n【27】3.  3.\n\n【28】    Will sedation help? Does cool mist help? In what way?\n\n【29】4.  4.\n\n【30】    Would the administration of nebulized racemic epinephrine help the child? How much would you give? How would you administer it?\n\n【31】5.  5.\n\n【32】    Should this baby be reintubated? Why? What tube size would you choose?\n\n【33】Answers\n\n【34】1.  1.\n\n【35】    This is an urgent situation. As the delivered FiO <sub>2 </sub> is increased, the child must be quickly evaluated and the cause determined. The child may have a decreased functional residual capacity (FRC) due to atelectasis or extravascular lung water that has led to the hypoxemia on the basis of V/Q mismatch. If this child has reactive pulmonary vasculature and elevated pulmonary vascular resistance as a result of long-standing obstructive sleep apnea, a brief period of hypoxemia may lead to a longer period of pulmonary artery hypertension with a resulting shunt at the atrial level across a patent foramen ovale. It is possible that long-standing elevated pulmonary artery pressure has resulted in right heart failure (cor pulmonale). It is important to treat the oximeter reading as accurate and begin therapy and evaluation. However, it is possible that the reading of 86% does not represent the true arterial saturation. The pulse oximeter calculates SpO <sub>2 </sub> using an algorithm based on the differential absorption of red and infrared light by HbO <sub>2 </sub> and Hb. HbO <sub>2 </sub> absorbs less light in the red wavelength and more in the infrared wavelength. Absorption of light of 800 nm wavelength is identical by both HbO <sub>2 </sub> and Hb. In cases of probe malposition or movement artifact, the algorithm may calculate an inaccurate SPO <sub>2 </sub> , and when this happens, the monitor reads an SPO <sub>2 </sub> of 85–86%.\n\n【36】    If the child had laryngospasm following extubation at the end of the case, another cause for the hypoxemia would be pulmonary edema. Occasionally, after laryngospasm, vigorous inspiration against a closed glottis can lead to the rapid development of negative pressure pulmonary edema. This can be diagnosed on the basis of typical findings on both physical exam and plain CXR.\n\n【37】    The ABG shows a mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis . There is moderate hypercarbia and a more severe acidosis than would be caused by the PaCO <sub>2 </sub> alone. It can be assumed that the child has not had chronic hypercarbia, and this can be confirmed by measurement of the bicarbonate. Hypoxemia is also present but the degree cannot be ascertained without knowledge of the FiO <sub>2. </sub> The hypoxemia is concerning but if the ABG were done while the child’s FiO <sub>2 </sub> was low, then intubation and distending airway pressure may not be indicated. The decision whether or not to reintubate should be made on the entire picture, the condition of the child, and the expected course he will take over the next 30–60 minutes is as important as the laboratory evaluation.\n\n【38】    The baby likely has postintubation stridor . Postoperative, postintubation stridor occurs in approximately 1% of children, particularly in children < 4 years of age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 , 22 \\]</u>. The syndrome is the result of edema of the tracheal wall below the level of the vocal cords. The mucosa in this area is not as tightly joined to the submucosa so that when edema develops there, the lumen is compromised to a greater degree than it would be if the mucosa and submucosa were tightly adherent to each other. Resistance to airflow in the trachea is inversely proportional to the radius taken to the fourth power for laminar flow and to the fifth power for turbulent flow. With subglottic edema and increased respiratory rate and effort, the gas flow will be turbulent. In this situation, the flow is now inversely proportional to the radius to the fifth power. Therefore, the smaller the tracheal lumen prior to the development of subglottic edema, the more likely it is that any edema will lead to clinical symptoms.\n\n【39】    Poiseuille equation :\n\n【40】$$$$ P=\\frac{8 Q\\mu L}{\\pi R4} $$$$\n\n【41】*   _Q_ \\= volumetric flow rate\n\n【42】*   _μ_ \\= viscosity, lb·sec/in <sup>2</sup>\n\n【43】*   _L_ \\= tube length, in\n\n【44】*   _R_ \\= tube radius, in\n\n【45】Some risk factors have been identified for the development of this problem. Tight-fitting endotracheal tubes, movement of the head and neck while intubated, intubation for 1 hour, and the presence of a URI may predispose the child to the development of postintubation croup 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 , 23 , 24 \\]</u>. Stridor usually develops soon after extubation and can worsen for several hours after it first is clinically apparent. In this case, the airway manipulations, including rigid bronchoscopy, are the causes of the stridor. In the situation where the SPO <sub>2 </sub> is not reading, it is important to administer a high FiO <sub>2 </sub> . Without a reliable SPO <sub>2 </sub> measurement, one must rely on the clinical picture in evaluating the patient.\n\n【46】1.  2.\n\n【47】    Treatment of postintubation stridor includes the administration of dexamethasone (decadron), a potent, longer-acting glucocorticoid. This medication will act to limit the degree of inflammation and the severity of the subglottic edema. Decadron administration will not decrease edema already present, however 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 \\]</u>.\n\n【48】2.  3.\n\n【49】    Sedation should be avoided. Depression of respiratory drive is dangerous in this situation. Nebulized racemic epinephrine may help by actually decreasing the degree of subglottic edema. The duration of the effect is generally 1 hour or less.\n\n【50】3.  4.\n\n【51】    Nebulized racemic epinephrine will act to decrease the subglottic edema. Once racemic epinephrine has been administered to a child with postintubation croup, the child should be admitted for observation with the expectation that subsequent doses will be needed. The usual dose of racemic epinephrine is 0.5 mL of the 2.25% solution diluted into 3–5 ml of NS and administered via a nebulizer. The mask is held near the child’s face with 100% oxygen used to nebulize the solution.\n\n【52】4.  5.\n\n【53】    In the event that reintubation is necessary, a smaller than normal endotracheal tube should be used. Intubating conditions should be as good as possible in order that the intubation does not cause additional trauma. The narrowed part of the airway, the subglottis, will not be visible to the laryngoscopist, but if the tube meets resistance once the tip is beyond the vocal cords, a smaller-diameter tube should be used.\n\n【54】Case 5\n------\n\n【55】You are called to the bedside of a 10-month-old who has just undergone a cleft palate repair. He has a temperature of 41.2 °C.\n\n【56】Questions\n\n【57】1.  1.\n\n【58】    What might have happened that his temperature got to this point?\n\n【59】2.  2.\n\n【60】    Could this represent malignant hyperthermia ? Why/why not?\n\n【61】Answers\n\n【62】1.  1.\n\n【63】    Postoperative hyperthermia usually is the result of excessive warming and is more common in pediatric patients than adult patients. In cases such as repair of cleft palate, the child is well covered by surgical drapes. If warming is undertaken during the case with devices such as forced hot air mattresses, warming blankets, humidification, and warming of inspired gases, the child’s core body temperature could easily rise to the level noted in the cases here. Hyperthermia in the PACU that is the result of excessive warming in the OR generally dissipates rather quickly once the sources of additional heat are removed. If the elevated temperature persists, other causes must be sought.\n\n【64】2.  2.\n\n【65】    It is possible that the temperature elevation is part of a response to systemic infection. Of course, any case of temperature elevation should bring the possibility of malignant hyperthermia to mind. The anesthetic record should be reviewed to learn the time course of the temperature elevation and to review the medications administered during the anesthetic. It is likely that the child would have been exposed to potent inhaled agents during the anesthetic. The presentation described here would be quite unusual for malignant hyperthermia . Most cases of malignant hyperthermia develop within the first few hours of an anesthetic, but there are reports of MH occurring well after the conclusion of a case. It is also unusual for fever to be the presenting sign of an episode of MH. Often tachycardia, hypertension, and tachypnea are noted first. If the child in this case were developing MH, mottled skin and muscle rigidity would be expected. The most consistent laboratory finding in cases of MH is a combined respiratory and metabolic acidosis.\n\n【66】    If MH is being considered in this child, laboratory evaluation including arterial and venous blood gas analysis, serum electrolytes, lactate, a coagulation profile and creatinine should be done prior to instituting any therapy. Other studies that may take longer to return but that will help to confirm the diagnosis such as CPK, myoglobin can also be sent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 26 \\]</u>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

If no satisfactory response is obtained, then the physician’s supervisor should be notified.\n\n【20】KEY POINTS\n\n【21】 Physicians who display disruptive behaviors (eg, verbal or physical abuse) not only violate the codes of medical ethics but erode team morale, undermine the delivery of quality medical care, and threaten both patient and staff safety.\n\n【22】 Strong interpersonal communication skills are essential to the practice of medicine.\n\n【23】 Interpersonal communication skills are influenced by a physician’s personality and culture as well as their training environment and past experiences. Medical providers display a wide range of communication styles, some of which may conflict, particularly in the context of busy environments or otherwise stressful situations.\n\n【24】 5Cs and SBAR are two models designed to ensure consistent, efficient, and professional communication while minimizing conflicts or misunderstandings between medical providers.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Both methylphenidate and sibutramine are stimulants that function by inhibiting neurotransmitter reuptake. Sibutramine is a drug used to treat obesity that inhibits the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine; methylphenidate treats attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder by inhibiting the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine.  \n\n【6】Answer B is incorrect . Orlistat is a diet drug that inhibits pancreatic lipase. It is also used in the treatment of obesity with the idea that reducing the activity of the lipase will reduce absorption of dietary fats. Its function is not similar to that of sibutramine.  \n\n【7】Answer C is incorrect . Selegiline is a selective monoamine oxidase inhibitor used to treat Parkinson disease. Its main function is to increase the amount of dopamine available in these patients.  \n\n【8】Answer D is incorrect . Tranylcypromine is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor used as an antidepressant.

He is using slow release morphine, diazepam, and amitriptyline. When he can get cannabis, he finds this is very effective for symptom control. He says that his back is much worse now and asks for an increase in opiate. He indicates that he might go back to buying on the street .\n> \n> Should the physician increase his morphine dose, or prescribe him a synthetic cannabis analogue?\n\n【9】Most, if not all, doctors and nurses in the UK are now educated in the basics of ethics and are familiar with the common four principles of autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice/fairness. They are easy to understand and to apply to clinical practice as a source of guidance. Further, there is a perception in the UK that a court would look favorably on a doctor who has acted using reasonable and demonstrable ethical process in decision-making, whatever the outcome (based on the UK tradition of the Bolam Test通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>1 </sup></u> and later, the Bolitho judgment,通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>2 </sup></u> in determining negligence). <sup>3</sup>\n\n【10】###### Ethical principles\n\n【11】###### Autonomy\n\n【12】Just because a patient has a dependency problem, this is no justification for denying their right to have their pain managed in an appropriate fashion and to being involved in decisions about treatment. Pain control may be difficult to achieve but clinicians have a duty of care to attempt this. The patient should have some autonomy to determine, within reason, his or her preferred approach. In cancer care we allow the patient to decide on treatment, from a range of drug and procedure options that may all be potentially toxic and harmful. Equally, we don’t agree to harmful therapeutic options. Doctors and nurses also have the right to not being abused, either by the patient, relatives, friends, or by the state authorities.\n\n【13】###### Beneficence\n\n【14】There is a widely held acceptance that pain control has benefits for both the individual and those around him/her. Therefore, beneficence is achieved by working towards this goal. However, determining the balance between analgesia and feel-good/pleasure effects in a patient with a significant dependency potential is difficult. A patient is likely to derive health benefits from having a prescribed, standardized, and uncontaminated source of their drug rather than being tempted to purchase on the street. Working with others to control abnormal behaviors associated with pain and to reduce chaotic lifestyles will be helpful, although for some patients this may become mere containment of the situation rather than progressive improvement. Containment, however, is better than deterioration.\n\n【15】###### Nonmaleficence\n\n【16】Providing a legitimate source of a drug for pain has its risks. A patient may see this as a way to support a drug dependency habit if the doctor can be convinced that the pain is the dominant problem. However, failing to help a patient with chronic pain may have a major impact on the rest of the family and local society. A similar situation occurs when such a patient is admitted to a ward with an acute pain problem. They can be disruptive when they cannot get their usual level of drug intake, or the extra medication, or alternatives needed to control the additional pain. One common reason for failure to manage this situation is that the doctors lack knowledge in prescribing appropriate amounts of medication. For example, finding patients prescribed a mere 10 mg of oral morphine for breakthrough pain, when their normal daily baseline intake is 500 mg of morphine, is a common occurrence. Similarly, wholly inadequate bolus doses of opioid are often programmed into PCA devices for post-operative pain in these patients, because doctors are terrified of causing an overdose by giving more than the standard dose used for an opioid naïve patient. Lack of adequate education in pain management for all clinicians is a serious systemic ethical failure.\n\n【17】Inevitably there are the occasional tragedies, as opioids are dangerous in the wrong hands. A patient of the author’s, who had proved very difficult to manage, went for a night out with a friend. While away, the troubled adolescent daughter broke into her mother’s apartment with some friends and decided to have a party. She searched out her mother’s slow-release morphine for a “trip,” vomited while unconscious, and died. While these occurrences should lead to a search for safeguards, they are not an adequate excuse for not providing, or attempting to provide, appropriate analgesia for pain.\n\n【18】###### Justice\n\n【19】Perhaps the most common ethical principle that is flouted is that of justice and fairness. Patients with dependency problems are often given a low priority for pain therapy due to their drug habit, lifestyle, attitudes to staff, and other personal issues. We easily lose impartiality, objectivity, compassion, interest, and patience. Interventional treatments are refused on “psychological” grounds. However, we have a “duty of care” and if we will not deliver it, then we should find others who will (perhaps comparable to the duty of a physician-conscientious objector to abortion to nevertheless find other caregivers for the patient). Overcoming the negativity can be very difficult when addressing the pain problems of the addicted patients who, for example, usually do not have interesting problems, are often not “nice” patients to treat, may be difficult to trust, and often waste clinical time and appointments, among other issues.\n\n【20】###### The principle of double effect\n\n【21】In the past, doctors have extensively debated the ethics of a principle of “double effect” of opiate use in palliative care, although the evidence that this is a problem is almost nonexistent.通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>4 </sup></u> (For further discussion of “double effect” see Chapter 15). In the UK it does not seem to be considered as a significant concern. However, the doctrine of “double effect” is broader, explaining the permissibility of an action that may have some benefit but might also cause harm as a side effect. A judgment has to be made between the potential benefits and the harms. Therefore, perhaps we should redefine the use of the term and apply it to the use of opioids (and other drugs) in relieving pain in the potentially dependent patient.\n\n【22】###### Opiate prescribing in the UK\n\n【23】As in the US, the UK has seen a substantial increase in the prescribing of opiates for non-malignant pain. There are perhaps two major causes. First, since the early 1980s, doctors have become confident in the management of the use of opiates in malignancy and this experience has been translated to non-malignant pain. Second, with the exception of gabapentinoids, there have been no significant pharmacological advances in\n\n【24】Table 25.1. Often misunderstood or misused terms in opioid dependency 删除换行 pain treatment except in modes of drug delivery. The desire for simple techniques for relieving pain has led doctors, particularly pain clinicians, to see opioids as a useful and valuable option and so there has been a drift to expand their use.\n\n【25】In the author’s own experience, in general, prescribing habits by pain specialists have had an “educational role” and are taken up by general practitioners, albeit a year or two later. However, in general, training in the management of chronic pain is still woefully inadequate.通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>5–7 </sup></u> Furthermore, few doctors, including pain clinicians, develop a comprehensive practice in the area of chronic pain in the opioid-dependent patient, because they often find the legal, ethical, and practical problems overwhelming.\n\n【26】###### Opioid dependency – a misunderstood problem\n\n【27】Despite the increasing recognition of chronic pain and opioid use, there is still much misunderstanding in the minds of doctors and nurses over the terminology associated with opioid dependency. Doctors still often describe patients as being addicted to their analgesics when in reality they may have some degree of dependency, but are not engaged in patterns of behavior associated with addiction . Conversely, people with dependency problems may develop acute or chronic pain, acute flare-ups of chronic pain, or pain associated with malignancy, AIDS or other life-limiting diseases. Furthermore, such patients may be taking their drugs for a variety of reasons (euphoria, escapism, relief of withdrawal symptoms, medicinal purposes, or a combination). The need for training in this area has been recognized and this is incorporated into the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) Curriculum.通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>8 </sup></u> The reality is that there are large numbers of clinicians that are highly skilled in interventional pain practice, but the same is not true for treating pain in patients with dependency.\n\n【28】###### Key differences between the UK and the US\n\n【29】The organization of the Health Service is a major difference between the UK and the US. All patients have a general practitioner who is the key both to ongoing prescribing and to the access to secondary care. There is a very limited role for the hospital emergency department to act as a primary health clinic and the access to a supply of opioids at this point is minimal. In hospital practice there is usually good, regular communication with the general practitioner. The normal practice would be to agree that there should only be one prescribing point for the patient. Initially, the pain clinic may manage prescribing until optimum dosing is achieved before returning this to the general practitioner. Some pain services have also developed strong links with the local addiction services to manage the addict with pain problems by running joint clinics.\n\n【30】Hence, in the UK, there is very little ability to go from doctor to doctor to obtain more and more prescription drugs. In practice, patients occasionally “lose” their drugs or use an excess, although they quickly learn that their requests for replacement are rarely accepted. The ability for the well off and well connected to access such drugs from private practitioners is limited. Close oversight by regulators identifies aberrant and/or high cost prescribing of opioids prescribed in primary care in locality. Prescribing opiates for registered addicts is managed through the addiction services, in general. Therefore, the access to opiates is reasonably well controlled and GPs take part in the long-term management of patients using opiates for pain, often sharing care with the pain clinics and palliative care services.\n\n【31】Diversion of prescribed opioids does not appear to be a great problem in the UK. In the past, problems of diversion were well recognized with short-acting opioids such as Dipipanone (Diconal), Dextromoride (Palfium) and Pethidine (Meperidine). This was resolved by either the agreed local banning of the drugs, or by agreed tight restriction in prescribing. Furthermore, it is well recognized in primary care now through education that these drugs have no use for managing chronic pain. It is notable that, in the UK, the use of diamorphine (heroin) has never been discontinued, unlike most other countries. Its use is principally within hospital practice and in palliative care. There has neither been any evidence of a significant problem with diversion nor any contribution to the widespread problems of recreational heroin use. Some addicts have been prescribed pharmaceutical grade heroin regularly to manage their addiction and there is also open debate about the possibilities of this approach to reduce their health problems. For the addict then there would be little incentive to exchange a quality product for other street drugs.\n\n【32】In contrast, the mild opioid, Dextropropoxyphene, combined with Paracetamol is widely used and well tolerated by many patients. It has been withdrawn recently because of concerns over its potential lethal effect when taken in deliberate overdose. The withdrawal of the drug led to many patients suffering increased pain when they were unable to find a suitable alternative. The regulatory authorities however, did not appear to engage in any debate on the ethics of this with pain clinicians. There are many other aspects of modern life that are useful and safe, but dangerous in the hands of the irresponsible. The drug alcohol and the automobile are two good examples.\n\n【33】###### Professional guidelines\n\n【34】The clinician trying to treat the problem patient with opioid dependency will find little evidence from clinical trials to guide pain management. What information there is has been extensively reviewed but the advice and guidance available are based on opinion and consensus.通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>9 </sup></u> ,通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>10 </sup></u> We are left in a situation where we are often faced with complex patients with complex problems and with limited resources and abilities to manage them. Trying to do the best for these patients is not determined by long-established medical and scientific principles. The American and British Pain Societies have however, produced guidelines giving practical advice.通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>11 </sup></u> ,通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>12</sup></u>\n\n【35】The British Guidelines also give examples of specific patient problems and how to deal with them. However, most patients present with a number of interconnected issues that are not easily resolvable, as in our case examples. The objective of achieving good pain control, good coping skills, and compliant, limited drug use is usually unattainable. Therefore, compromise and pragmatism are often needed to contain unsolvable problems. If this is supported by the explicit use of ethical principles, it may be possible to find the optimum way forward.\n\n【36】In the UK, Clinical Ethics Committees are still emerging and evolving. They have commonly provided an advisory service to the clinician to help with decision-making but in general, do not hand down formal judgments. Unfortunately, most public debate of ethical issues seems to revolve around exotic problems at the extremes of life rather than the everyday problems of clinical practice. Occasionally, clinicians refer complex cases to the courts for a decision, thereby obtaining the protection of the law, but in reality, handing over medical problems to nonclinicians.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Although benign mechanical causes are most common， the ED physician must consider the “cannot miss\"diagnoses： cauda equina syndrome， spinal fracture， spinal infection (epidural abscess or spondylitis)， and malignancy. A careful his-tory and physical examination are important to identify “red flags”that may herald the presence of serious disease .

However， if a serious etiology is suspected， laboratory studies and imaging may be necessary. In general， pain control is a high priority for these patients. If the patient is critically ill， stabilization of the ABCs and surgical consultation may be needed.\n\n【17】**CLINICAL APPROACH**\n\n【18】Back pain is the second most common complaint that impels people to visit their primary care physicians. Seventy to ninety percent of adults suffer from acute low back pain during their lifetime. The differential diagnosis of low back pain is exten-sive. Common causes include muscle strain， ligamentous injury， osteoarthritis， disk herniation， spondylolisthesis， and fracture. Infectious etiologies are epidural abscess， spondylitis， diskitis， and herpes zoster. Malignancies that cause low back pain may be primary or， more commonly， metastatic. Rheumatologic diseases such as ankylos-ing spondylitis and Reiter syndrome are other considerations. Back pain may also be referred from various gastrointestinal， genitourinary， gynecologic， and vascular sources (most ominously from an abdominal aortic aneurysm). Miscellaneous causes include sickle cell pain crisis and functional back pain.\n\n【19】The history and physical examination are important to distinguish benign causes from potentially life-threatening ones. Table 35-2 describes the typical findings for patients with the“cannot miss”causes of low back pain. Important historical ques-tions include location， duration， and onset of pain； aggravating and alleviating fac-tors； associated symptoms； work history； history of trauma； and past medical history(including comorbidities， medications， and family history).\n\n【20】The ED physician should note the patient's vital signs because any abnormali-ties may herald a life-threatening disease process (eg， hypotension due to sepsis or a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm). The physical examination should screen for signs of systemic disease and possible sources of referred back pain. If pos-sible， gait and range of motion of the back should be observed. Inspection of the back can identify bony abnormalities such as scoliosis and skin lesions that sug-gest infection (erythema， warmth) or trauma (swelling， ecchymosis). The back should be palpated to isolate the area of maximal tenderness. Point tenderness over the spinous processes may indicate a destructive lesion of the spine. Pain that is severe or excessive has increased suspicion of acute spinal infection or AAA. The neurologic examination should focus on identifying any focal weakness， der-matomal sensory loss， and decreased or absent deep tendon reflexes. Straight-leg raise (SLR) testing involves the examiner passively elevating the supine patient’s leg (with knee extended) 30 to 70 degrees. If the SLR elicits radicular pain in the low back radiating down the leg to below the knee， it is indicative of sciatic nerve root irritation. This test is more sensitive (80%) than specific (40%). A positive crossed SLR (elevation of the unaffected leg causes radicular pain in the affected leg) is very specific (90%) but insensitive (25%).

The history and physical examination can help separate the majority of patients with simple， self-limited musculoskeletal back pain from the minority with more serious underlying causes. If rheumatologic causes， malignancy， or infection are concerns， a complete blood count， erythro-cyte sedimentation rate， and urinalysis may be helpful. Indications for plain x-rays include age less than 18 years or older than 50 years； recent trauma； history or suspicion of malignancy； pain lasting longer than 4 to 6 weeks； history of fever， intravenous drug use， or immunocompromised； and progressive neurologic deficits. Further imaging by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging may be required if a strong suspicion of fracture， spinal infection， malignancy， or cauda equina syndrome exists.\n\n【25】**_Ireatment_**\n\n【26】If a patient with low back pain is hemodynamically unstable， cardiac monitoring and resuscitation with intravenous fluids is mandated. If infection is suspected， antibiotics should be administered. Stable patients benefit from pain management. Depending on the mc severity of the pain， intravenous narcotics such as morphine or fentanyl may be required. If the pain is less severe， oral narcotics or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be sufficient. Benzodiazepines may be use-ful adjuncts to provide some muscle relaxation and sedation.\n\n【27】Patients with simple musculoskeletal back pain can be treated with pain control(primarily acetaminophen and NSAIDs). Oral narcotics may be used for a short period of time if the pain is not adequately controlled by the aforementioned medi-cations. Application of local heat or ice may provide some pain relief. Although strict bed rest was once the recommended treatment， resumption of normal daily activities has been shown to hasten recovery and resolution of pain. Strenuous exer-cise should be avoided until the acute pain has subsided. Nearly all patients recover with conservative management within 4 to 6 weeks.\n\n【28】Admission should be considered for patients with underlying etiologies that require inpatient management， those with abnormal vital signs， those requiring intravenous narcotics for pain control， and those who cannot walk.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

She had begun a new job several months prior and had been under significant psychological stress. She noted daily episodes of sudden, transient loss of consciousness. These episodes occurred with only momentary (seconds) warning. The episodes were unwitnessed and exclusively occurred in her car while she was driving, specifically while backing her car out of a parking spot. She believed that the duration was less than 1 to 2 minutes but could not be sure. She denied being confused after the episodes, and she denied any urinary incontinence or tongue biting. She ultimately presented for evaluation with neurology after she struck another car after losing consciousness while backing out of a parking space. At that time, she denied any other neurologic symptoms. Although she was under significant stress related to her work, she had no concerns regarding cognition. She denied any headache, vision changes, weakness, numbness, or gait difficulty.\n\n【3】_At times a patient’s chief complaint may not even sound like it is a neurologic condition. Especially given the context of this patient’s significant stress, your first instinct might be to dismiss her symptoms as psychiatric, functional, or cardiac. Admittedly, this is an artificial exercise and the case is_ _included in a book on unknown neurologic disorders, so she likely has a neurologic disorder. However, try to put yourself in the mindset of encountering this patient in the clinic or the emergency room. What about her history catches your attention that her presentation could hint at a neurologic disorder_ _?_\n\n【4】Her neurologic exam was normal. Her vital signs were normal in a seated and standing position. She had no orthostatic hypotension. However, she had several episodes of sinus bradycardia while on telemetry monitoring that corresponded to turning her head to the left or right.### What is the pace?\n\n【5】The onset of her symptoms is seconds, which is consistent with a hyperacute pace.### What is the localization?\n\n【6】This case is different than the others. She has a normal neurologic exam. Since her exam is normal, is this even a neurologic problem? How do we attempt to localize the lesion? Let’s do this case slightly differently and come back to localization after we discuss the syndromic diagnosis.### What is the syndromic diagnosis?\n\n【7】So far, we have only discussed neurologic disorders as the potential etiology of various presentations. However, patients may have a “non-neurologic” disorder that causes symptoms that can be construed as being neurologic in nature. For example, an elderly woman with severe osteoarthritis may have a chief complaint of gait difficulty. In addition, patients with psychiatric illness may present with neurologic manifestations of disease.\n\n【8】In the case of hyperacute loss of consciousness, in addition to the etiologies we have previously discussed, such as stroke, seizure, or metabolic abnormality, there is one other important etiology on the differential. Syncope is the loss of consciousness secondary to decreased cerebral perfusion, and as neurologists, we might mistakenly come to the conclusion that syncope is “non-neurologic” in origin. We typically look to the history to help us distinguish between syncope and other neurologic diagnoses, such as seizure or stroke. However, often the patient cannot provide the history if there are no witnesses. When a patient presents after an episode of loss of consciousness, we are frequently left asking the age-old question: Did they fall (syncope) or were they pushed (seizure)? Our ability to answer that question is usually most dependent on the history rather than any ancillary data collected after the fact.\n\n【9】In this case, does her presentation seem most consistent with a primary neurologic diagnosis, such as seizure or stroke? Are her symptoms more consistent with an alternative explanation, such as syncope or even panic attack? What are the salient features?\n\n【10】The episodes are brief and stereotyped, and she appears to have a warning prior to losing consciousness. In addition, she is not confused for a prolonged time period after the episode. This argues against a seizure in that we might expect her to have a post-ictal period if she had been having seizures. Stroke seems less likely given the stereotyped nature of the events and the fact that she has such profound loss of consciousness but is otherwise neurologically normal and makes a full recovery. The history fits well with syncope. In addition, she has episodes of sinus bradycardia, which could lead to syncope and be an important clue in making her final diagnosis.\n\n【11】Now we can return to localization. What is the localization of syncope, and how might we explain why she has syncope only when backing her car out of a parking spot? Can her syncope be secondary to a neurologic condition?### What is the localization?\n\n【12】Syncope is not always due to a cardiac etiology. The nervous system exerts substantial control over heart rate and blood pressure. To understand syncope, we must first understand how the body regulates blood pressure.\n\n【13】Since central venous pressure is typically close to 0 mmHg, we can simplify the formula as follows:\n\n【14】For the purposes of this discussion, we will not discuss factors that lower mean arterial pressure (MAP) that are non-neurologic, such as decreased blood volume from hemorrhage. We will focus on the signals the nervous system receives regarding MAP (afferent input) and the mechanisms by which the nervous system responds to alternations in MAP (efferent output).\n删除3：<u>Figure 24.1 is a graphical representation of the following discussion. Baroreceptors in the carotid sinus (glossopharyngeal nerve) and aortic arch (vagus nerve) detect changes in arterial pressure and pulse pressure (systolic minus diastolic pressure). Of these two, the carotid sinus (located at the base of the internal carotid arteries) plays the more important role of detecting rapid, beat-to-beat changes in arterial pressure. These baroreceptors, with the carotid sinus being the dominant source of input for rapid changes in blood pressure, make up the afferent loop to the baroreflex. Of note, there are additional baroreceptors present in the atria of the heart and large pulmonary vessels that detect decreased blood volume. These receptors send their afferent signals to the endocrine system (such as hypothalamus) and lead to alterations in water and salt retention.</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 24.1 Schematic of the role of the autonomic nervous system in modulating the cardiovascular system.

Richards, _Human Physiology_ 删除10：<u>(Oxford, United Kingdom: Oxford University Press, 2013)</u>, 420.\n\n【16】Nerves carrying information from the baroreceptors in the carotid sinus and aortic arch end in the medulla in the nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS). The NTS has multiple projections to the various efferent limbs of the baroreflex. First, the NTS sends signals to the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve. Vagal nerve fibers project to various components of the cardiac electrical conducting system, and increased vagal activity leads to decreased cardiac output via mechanisms such as decreased heart rate. Second, the NTS sends simultaneous signals to the intermediolateral cells of the thoracic spinal cord, which modulate systemic vascular resistance. Increased sympathetic outflow leads to vasoconstriction and an increase in systemic vascular resistance.\n\n【17】Although the anatomy is complicated, the end effect of baroreceptor stimulation is quite simple. For example, a sudden decrease in blood pressure (such as what occurs going from sitting to standing) leads to decreased vagal activity and increased systemic vascular resistance. This causes an increase in heart rate and systemic vascular resistance to maintain a normal blood pressure. Conversely, a sudden increase in blood pressure leads to increased vagal activity, which causes decreased heart rate and decreased systemic vascular resistance.\n\n【18】We can summarize the preceding discussion as follows: Neurologic causes of syncope can involve lesions to either the afferent limb of the baroreflex (carotid sinus or aortic arch baroreceptors) or the efferent limb of the baroreflex (vagal or sympathetic outflow).\n\n【19】Now that we have discussed the localization of syncope in general, we can try to identify the localization of her specific lesion.\n\n【20】The history she provides is critical for localizing the lesion. If you need to, take a minute to review the case. She reports these episodes exclusively occurred while backing her car out of a parking spot. In addition, she had episodes of bradycardia when turning her head to the left or right. How can we explain this?\n\n【21】When she is backing her car out of a parking spot, she is turning her head to look over her shoulder. Presumably, this is causing bradycardia, just like what was seen on telemetry when she turned her head to the left or right. We can explain this using our knowledge of the baroreflex. When she turns her head she must be stimulating the baroreceptors in her carotid sinus, which is the afferent limb of the baroreflex. This leads to increased vagal activity to the heart and bradycardia as well as decreased sympathetic outflow and systemic vascular resistance. This must be the mechanism behind her syncope.### What is the etiologic diagnosis?\n\n【22】She presents with recurrent episodes of syncope. We suspect this is due to pathologic baroreflex activation of the carotid sinus, given that it only occurs when she turns her head to the left or right. Now we just need to take a close look at her carotid arteries to see if we can find an explanation as to why turning her head to one side or the other causes pathologic baroreflex activation.### Conclusion\n\n【23】A conventional angiogram  showed a left internal carotid artery dissection. In addition, she had a left vertebral artery dissection (not pictured) and a “beaded” appearance of the right internal carotid artery.\n删除3：<u>Figure 24.2 ( A ) Conventional angiograph of her left carotid artery shows tapering and occlusion ( _arrow_ ) consistent with a right internal carotid artery dissection. ( B ) Conventional angiography of her right carotid artery shows the characteristic “beading” of fibromuscular dysplasia ( _arrow_ ).</u>\n\n【24】Images courtesy of Dr. David Paydarfar.\n\n【25】The etiologic diagnosis is intermittent carotid sinus dysfunction secondary to internal carotid artery dissection. Her multiple dissections as well as the “beaded” appearance of her right internal carotid artery are consistent with a pathologic diagnosis of fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). The cause of FMD is unknown, but it is characterized as a non-artheromatous, non-inflammatory disease of the arteries that is almost exclusively seen in women. In her case, this led to arterial dissection, which presented with syncope due to damage of the afferent carotid baroreceptors.\n\n【26】For reference, other etiologies of pathologic carotid sinus syndromes include neoplasms exerting mechanical compression or arising within the carotid sinus, compression from the styloid process of the temporal bone, or other causes of intrinsic carotid disease such as atheromatous disease, vasculitis, or complications of carotid surgery.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

One of the first to use such an island flap was the German Surgeon, Ernst Blasius 通用删除7(英):<u>(1802–1875)</u>, who described this technique in the closure of skin defects in 1850 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. As we know, The design of a V-Y flap is very simple. The principle is to use skin from an area of relative excess to fill an area of deficiency. A “V”-shaped flap is incised adjacent to and advanced into the defect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. However, one of the major problems with the V-Y advancement flap when used as a cheek advancement flap is the vertical scar, which violates the relaxed skin tension lines of the cheek 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Therefore it is best reserved for lesions alongside creases such as the nasolabial fold. Defects involving the lower eyelid region on the cheek can be challenging because of the unique anatomical arrangements of the structures in this region. One of the risks of using V-Y advancement flaps are poor scars and ectropion of the lower lids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. It is important to assess this risk pre-operatively. The “pinch test” and “snap back test” are used to detect the presence of lower lid laxity. The result is abnormal if the lid can be distended more than 6 mm from the globe or does not briskly returns to its natural position 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Gravity may also exert a pull on the lower eyelid leading to delayed ectropion formation in inferiorly based island flaps on the cheek. Therefore it is often advisable to anchor the flap to the periosteum of the lower orbit 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Standard technique in such situations is to anchor the flap dermis to the periosteum of the infraorbital rim with permanent sutures. While some surgeon use absorbable sutures, I prefer to use 4.0 nylon or polypropylene permanent sutures in this situation.\n\n【15】Larger V-Y flaps can be complicated by their gravitational weight and contraction that can pull down on the lower eyelid margin despite the appropriate orientation of tension vectors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. In the author’s experience, such ectropion formation is often delayed and noticeable after several months, even a year post-surgery. There are also problems with using a pedicle flap against a skin crease line – while using a island flap, the tension across the flap suture line tends to aggravate skin tension and leads to trap-door deformity. In contrast, when using a transposition flap such as a bilobed flap, the tension across the line of closure will result in pin-cushioning of the flap.\n\n【16】In this case report, we review the oblique-sigmoid island flap and our modification of the flap to suit lower eyelid defects and cheek defects against the RSTL. Given the tension vectors and the orientation of the scar, it reduces both the risk of ectropion and also scar contraction – given the scar is not orientated vertically, and therefore gravity plays less of a part.\n\n【17】Case Study\n\n【18】This 65-year old patient presented with a large left lower eyelid skin basal cell cancer. The horizontal lie of the lesion meant that primary closure was not possible if following the relaxed skin tension lines.\n\n【19】Pre-op assessment revealed the risk of ectropion given her lax lower eyelid skin. Further given the orientation of the lesion, closure against the RSTL on her mid cheek would leave a poor cosmetic outcome. It was decided to use a modified sigmoid-oblique island flap. Figures 3.1 , 3.2 , and 3.3 shows the RSTL as well as the orientation of the excision ‘ellipse’ being against the RSTL. The illustration  shows the tension vectors of the oblique-sigmoid island flap. The clinical photographs show my modification of the oblique-sigmoid flap and the discussion below details the technique as well as offers helpful tips and techniques.\n删除3：<u>Figure 3.1\n\n【20】Sigmoid oblique flap plan\n</u>删除3：<u>Figure 3.2\n\n【21】Sigmoid oblique flap being raised\n</u>删除3：<u>Figure 3.3\n\n【22】Sigmoid oblique flap sutured\n</u>删除3：<u>Figure 3.4</u>\n\n【23】Sigmoid island flap\n\n【24】The Oblique-Sigmoid Island Flap\n-------------------------------\n\n【25】The oblique-sigmoid island flap was originally described by Ono and colleagues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The design was developed as an attempt to overcome traditional problems with cutaneous island pedicle flaps 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u> – trapdoor formation, depressed scar (due to orientation of scar against RSTL or vertical scars on the cheek) and dog-earing.\n\n【26】The Technique\n-------------\n\n【27】The tumor is excised with adequate margins. Ono originally described a circular excision of the tumor. In my experience, we can simply excise the lesion with adequate margin without paying attention to the exact shape. Ono describes creating triangular skin flaps 1–2 mm in length. This is a particularly important step in my view and it is especially important to orientate the tips of these isosceles triangles in the direction of the RSTL as per the illustration and clinical photographs. A subcutaneous island pedicle flap is created – this has a lazy-S orientation facing the defect and a spindle-shape on the other side . The flap then slides in an oblique fashion to close the defect. It is this oblique advancement that reduces the risk of ectropion formation for lower eyelid defects. In my experience, as in Ono’s original review of 32 patients, we don’t usually see trap-door formation or depressed scars, which are relatively common with island pedicle flaps on the cheek – especially if attention is paid to ‘unfolding’ the pedicle while dissection (explained further below). Further, as the post-operative scar is spindle shaped, and orientated along the RSTL, this allows for a much more natural contour defect post-operatively.\n\n【28】It is worth spending some time in discussing the mobilization of subcutaneous island pedicle flaps and the approaches espoused by various authors. Field described a technique wherein longitudinal dissection is done through the pedicle – this effectively creates a bi-pedicled flap is the safest in terms of preventing disruption to the sensation of the flap 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Dzubow advocated incising the underlying muscle on all but one side to allow the flap to swing on a muscular pedicle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Heller, on the other hand Heller, describes elevating the flap on a long horizontal pedicle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】Chan 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u> has described an elegant technique of dissecting island flaps, which in my experience helps to reduce the pin-cushioning that can occur with island flaps. This unfolding of the pedicle also creates less bulkiness post operatively. In Chan’s method, defect XY is created as shown in Fig. 3.5 . (my modification of the Chan technique) – A triangular advancement flap AX is marked out. The leading edge of the triangular flap X is undermined just deep to the sub-dermal plexus to about a third of its length B. The tail of the Flap A is then undermined towards the defect, going deeper at a 30° angle as one approaches the defect, to about half of the length of the flap. An oblique subcutaneous pedicle AC is therefore created. The flap is then advanced using AC as a long oblique pedicle, helped by the “unfolding” of the flap BX when the leading edge of the flap was undermined to create the pedicle.\n删除3：<u>Figure 3.5\n\n【30】Dissection technique of Island flaps cheek\n</u>\nFor small defects where there is adequate mobility of the subcutaneous tissue, conventional methods of lateral undermining may be sufficient to advance the flap and no undermining beneath the flap need take place – allowing the flap to ‘sit-on’ the defect. However, when larger defects are concerned (and in this case report I am discussing the use of oblique-sigmoid island flaps to close a large defect >1 cm) conventional techniques of dissecting the V-Y island flap (or indeed any island flap) prove inadequate. This dissection technique often avoids the need for undermining.\n\n【31】If the pedicle of the flap is totally free from any tethering tension, then the caudal part of the flap can be sutured on to the adjacent skin on each side for support and the cephalad part of the flap, under no tension at all, can be “stacked” on itself with an abundance of tissue to support the lid margin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【32】When compared to the V-Y island flap, the oblique-sigmoid flap has a narrower width (as it is more elliptical, rather than a triangle) and this serves to exert some horizontal tension, which in turn reduces the risk of lower eyelid ectropion.\n\n【33】One of the problems with island flaps in the loss of sensation that can occur due to the dissection and patients need to be warned about numbness. In 1975, Field described a new method of dissecting island flaps of the cheek. He originally developed it as he grew ‘disenchanted’ with the post-operative bulkiness -- his method of undermining and effectively creating dual neurovascular pedicles 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u> has been shown to reduce the risk of post-operative loss of sensation. While I have found Field’s method useful for V-Y island advancement flaps, for the oblique-sigmoid flap, due to its design characteristics, the method I described earlier – of creating an ‘unfolded’ pedicle works well.\n\n【34】In discussing the oblique-sigmoid flap, some authors have noted the reduced incidence of pin-cushioning using this technique when compared to others. When a surgeon removes a lesion, the skin edges fall back due to elastic recoil of the dermis. This creates a wound that is initially 20–30 % wider than the defect. As healing occurs over the next days and weeks, the skin around the defect contracts. The amount of contraction depends on the site of the defect. If the width of the flap has been made equal to that of the immediate defect, contracture of the wound edges will cause the flap to buckle upward or “pop up,” i.e. pin-cushion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【35】Ono originally described the defect for removal of small skin tumors of the cheek under 1 cm. In my opinion, for such small tumors undermining and primary closure utilizing the RSTL often achieves superior results when compared to the island flap. In my modification, this flap becomes very useful for larger cheek defects and lower eyelid defects – especially where the vectors of excision lie against the RSTL.\n\n【36】In conclusion, the oblique- sigmoid flap is an excellent technique to use on the cheek when an island flap is planned. It has less complications when compared to traditional V-Y advancement flaps and allows for a scar that is more aligned with the normal contours of the cheek. I reserve the V-Y island flap when the lesions are located along the nasolabial crease. For mid cheek and lower eyelid lesions the oblique-sigmoid flap, modified using the techniques I have described above, makes a good choice.\n\n【37】However, we must pay heed to Blasius, who is credited with inventing the island pedicle flap for closure of cheek defects. Blasius stressed: “Die Heilung erfolge per primam intentionem.” Namely, the best healing is by primary closure. It was his intention to convince surgeons that primary closure in plastic surgery is superior to all other methods and that is something that must not be forgotten in our eagerness to try out new techniques.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

PV， the most common of the myelodysplastic disorders， is seen with an elevated hemoglobin and/or hematocrit； it can be initially differenti-ated as relative polycythemia or absolute polycythemia. When plasma volume is decreased secondary to diuretics or GI losses such as vomiting and diarrhea， hemoglobin and hematocrit (which represent the concentration of RBCs in blood) can be artificially elevated， commonly referred to as hemoconcentration or relative polycythemia. In these cases， once a patient is appropriately fluid resus-citated， hemoglobin and hematocrit are expected to normalize on a repeat CBC. If there is no normalization of hemoglobin/hematocrit or if the clinical picture is suggestive of PV， then absolute polycythemia， characterized by an increase in RBC mass， is suspected.**\n\n【37】**Absolute polycythemia can then further be divided into two categories，primary or secondary . Primary polycythemia， caused most commonly by the JAK2 mutation， results in increased RBC mass. Secondary polycythemia is driven by elevated levels of EPO， which is secreted in response to low levels of oxygen， to stimulate RBC production by the bone marrow. Most commonly， secondary poly-cythemia stems from chronic hypoxia from a cardiac or pulmonary origin， namely， chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)， obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)， obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS)，right-to-left cardiac shunt， high altitude， or even heavy smoking. Performance-enhancing drugs such as anabolic steroids/testosterone， growth hormone， and EPO have started to become a more common cause of polycythemia. Additional causes include EPO-producing tumors， such as hepatocellular carcinoma， renal cell carcinoma， uterine leiomyoma， and adrenal sources such as pheochromocytoma.**\n\n【38】**Diagnosis. If patient has elevated hemoglobin/hematocrit on complete blood count in the context of normovolemia and normal O， saturation along with signs and symptoms of PV， then further evaluation with serum EPO level and/or JAK2V617F mutation is warranted. If the EPO is elevated， then it is secondary polycy-themia， most commonly associated with hypoxia. If the EPO is low to normal or if signs/symptoms of PV are seen， then a positive JAK2 mutation is helpful in con-firming its diagnosis. A bone marrow biopsy shows hypercellularity with trilineage growth. Diagnostic criteria are shown in Table 57-3.**\n\n| **Table 57-3·POLYCYTHEMIA VERA DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA**  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Major Criteria**  | **Minor Criterion**  |\n| **1\\.

Other times， patients present with a con-stellation of symptoms， many of which may be nonspecific. Symptoms commonly associated with PV include night sweats， weight loss， early satiety， gout， pruritis， and erythromelalgia. Pruritis， described by many as itchiness， tingling， or burning after a warm or hot shower， is often one of the chief complaints of a PV patient. Eryth-romelalgia， which consists of a burning pain， redness， and increased temperature in the hands and feet， is also a classic finding. Patients with PV are known to have an increased risk of thrombosis， whether a DVT， pulmonary embolism (PE)， stroke， or arterial thrombus. Physical examination of a PV patient may include a plethora of the retinal veins and face， hepatomegaly， splenomegaly， thrombosis， easy bleed-ing or bruising， and tophi. If hyperviscosity develops， patients may have fatigue， headache， blurry vision， stroke， and paresthesias.**\n\n【43】**_Treatment_**\n\n【44】PV is a slowly progressive disease that can develop over decades， so treatment may be indefinite. Overall， there are two main goals： 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> to reduce microvascular symp-toms， such as pruritis， erythromelgia， and bleeding； and 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> to reduce thrombotic events.\n\n【45】**Low-dose aspirin is recommended for all PV patients unless contraindications are present. Aspirin is particularly useful in reducing pruritis and erythromelal-gia. Therapeutic phlebotomy which decreases risk of thrombotic events by reduc-ing hematocrit and expanding plasma volume， is the centerpiece of PV treatment. Phlebotomy aims to keep hematocrit levels < 45% in men and <42% in women.**\n\n【46】**High-risk PV patients are those who are>60 years old and/or have a history of thrombosis. In these patients， cytoreductive treatment might be useful. Further-more， treatment may be indicated in low-risk patients with uncontrolled symptoms， increasing platelet counts (especially over 1，000，000/uL) or persistently elevated hematocrit despite phlebotomy. Hydroxyurea， a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor that disrupts DNA repair to reduce the number of RBCs made by bone marrow， is the first-line cytoreductive agent. Side effects include cytopenia， oral ulcers， and diarrhea. In patients who fail hydroxyurea， ruxolitinib (Jakafi)， a JAK inhibitor， is**\n\n【47】**becoming a mainstay in PV treatment. Other cytoreductive agents include inter-feron alfa or busulfan. Interferon alfa is often used in patients <40 years and in pregnant patients. Busulfan， an alkylating agent， is tied to many side effects， includ-ing cytopenias， pulmonary fibrosis， skin discoloration， and/or leukemia.**\n\n【48】**Prognosis. All of the MPNs (PV， MF， and ET) can spontaneously progress to acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome. Of the three， ET is the least likely to progress， while primary MF is the most likely to transform. The 10-year transformation rate is roughly 2% to 5% in ET， 5% to 8% in PV， and 8% to 20%in MF. The median survival times also follow a similar pattern， with average sur-vival being 20 years for ET， 14 years for PV， and 6 years for MF. In PV patients， risk factors that increase risk of transformation to leukemia include age > 60， history of thrombosis， and leukocytosis. In ET， increased age and anemia corre-late with risk of fibrotic transformation. Once progression to leukemia and/or blast phase has occurred， treatment includes induction chemotherapy followed by allogenic hematopoietic cell transplantation.**\n\n【49】**CASE CORRELATION●See also Case 14 (Pulmonary Embolism) and Case 58 (Sickle Cell Crisis).**", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

She reports a 6.8-kg (15-lb) unintentional weight loss and general loss of appetite. She says she drinks wine occasionally but has never smoked cigarettes. X-ray of the chest reveals a subpleural mass. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【1】> (A) Adenocarcinoma of the lung\n\n【2】> (B) Carcinoid tumor of the lung\n\n【3】> (C) Metastases to lung from a primary tumor from another tissue type\n\n【4】> (D) Small-cell carcinoma of the lung\n\n【5】> (E) Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung\n **Answer**: The correct answer is A . Critical points to consider in this question are first, that the patient is a nonsmoker; second, that the lesion is localized peripherally (subpleural mass); and third, that the patient is a woman. About 95% of all lung cancers can be classified into one of two categories: small cell lung cancers make up 13%, and non-small cell lung cancers (consisting of adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinomas, and other histologic types) make up the rest. Adenocarcinoma is the most prevalent type of lung cancer, representing 38% of all diagnosed cases. Relative to squamous cell carcinoma (the second most prevalent subtype), adenocarcinoma is more often seen in non-smokers than in smokers (62% vs 18%), and more often seen in women than in men irrespective of smoking status. Treatment interventions differ by type. Because adenocarcinomas are typically peripherally located (75%), they often are more amenable to surgical removal than other tumor types, although the success of treatment depends more on the stage of the tumor than the type. Adenocarcinoma often, but not always, presents as multiple masses.  \n\n【6】Answer B is incorrect . Carcinoid tumors are found in major bronchi and may cause carcinoid syndrome (flushing due to excessive histamine release). They are of neuroendocrine origin and have no link with smoking.  \n\n【7】Answer C is incorrect . Although metastases from other organs arise more commonly than primary lung tumors, they are most often multifocal, not a single peripheral nodule. Metastases to lung principally arise from primary tumors of the breast, colon, and kidney.  \n\n【8】Answer D is incorrect . Small cell carcinoma of the lung is an undifferentiated tumor usually present in a central location. There is a strong association with smoking and it is more often seen in men. Small cell carcinoma metastasizes early and may secrete hormones such as ADH and ACTH. Small cell lung cancer is rarely resectable and is most often treated with combination chemotherapy and radiation.  \n\n【9】Answer E is incorrect . Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung often presents as a centrally located hilar mass. This lung cancer subtype is more common in men, and it exhibits the strongest link to smoking.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

He had fever for 8 days, and antibiotic treatment was ineffective. He also had 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> transient bilateral conjunctival congestion; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> erythema and cracked lips. The cervical lymph nodes were < 1.5 cm and the CRP was normal, which disagreed with KD. Of course, we could assume that the lymphadenopathy was big enough at beginning, but regressed to less than 1.5 cm on Day 8 of illness.\n\n【27】Differential diagnosis of ocular membrane thermal was considered. Supporting evidences include fever, conjunctival hyperemia. WBC and CRP were normal. However, negative test in adenovirus, especially along with no purulent secretions in both eyes, the most important symptom to distinguish it from KD, did not support ocular membrane thermal.\n\n【28】Echo performed earlier indicated that the diameter of coronary artery was normal in the high range. However, there was a significant decrease in albumin, which may be one of the causes of CAA in the later stage. Hypoproteinemia may aggravate coronary artery injury. Although this boy had MP infection, chest CT did not find severe pneumonia or pleural effusion, and physical examination did not find edema changes on both legs. It is difficult to explain hypoalbuminemia, thus, we highly suspected he was a typical KD.\n\n【29】The patient was admitted on the Day 8 of illness, and antibiotics treatment was ineffective. On the following day, the diameter of coronary artery was at a critical value. KD was highly suspected in this case. However, parents were concerned with possible complications associated with procedures, i.e. IVIG, and insisted on diagnosis confirmation first followed by treatment. They turned down IVIG treatment. Persuaded by professionals repeatedly, his parents agreed on IVIG treatment. As stated in guideline, it is better to give IVIG at Day 5-Day 10 of illness. Based on our experience, infants would be crying and be irritated, and older babies would have headache symptom, if infusion of IVIG 2 mg/kg lasts less than 10 h. Blood colloid osmotic pressure raised rapidly, which may result in headaches due to increased circulating blood volume. He received infusion of mannitol (20%) and furosemide after 1 g/kg IVIG. He had no discomforts.\n\n【30】On the Day 11 of the illness, periungual desquamation occurred which supported the AKD diagnosis. Repeated echo showed CAA, which confirmed KD diagnosis. This also supports that early diagnosis and timely IVIG therapy are very important. MP antibody gradually turned positive, while tuberculosis antibodies were weakly positive. PPD was negative, and lung CT showed no signs of tuberculosis changes. After 6 months of follow-up, tuberculosis antibodies were negative without anti-tuberculosis treatment. It was possible a false positives that could be a result of cross immunoreaction.\n\n【31】### 13.2.5 Case Specific Clinic Features\n\n【32】1.  1.\n\n【33】    The number of CSF cells was normal. The patient should be diagnosed with aseptic meningitis, because of lethargy, high pressure in CSF, and abnormal slow wave of EEG. At the beginning of admission, both WBC and CRP were normal, which does not meet the criteria for classic KD. There was specific bilateral conjunctival congestion with no purulent secretion. Adenovirus titer was negative. NT pro-BNP was increased. Together they support KD. It has been reported that the combination treatment using IVIG and glucocorticoids is beneficial for KD patients with severe myocarditis and meningitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Diagnosis tends to be delayed in atypical cases, which can cause severe coronary artery damage. Therefore it was important to explain his conditions and prognosis to his parents as soon as possible, so he could get treatment on time.\n\n【34】2.  2.\n\n【35】    KD is characterized with systemic vessel inflammation, and complications in nervous system are often overlooked. Histopathological examination in KD nervous system finds edema, necrosis, glial cell hyperplasia, lymphocyte invasion, etc. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Children with KD have diverse neurological involvement. Aseptic meningitis is the most common complication in KD, followed by seizures, whereas temporary hemiplegia, facial paralysis, ataxia, hearing impairment, visual abnormalities, behavioral abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 – 7 \\]</u> are rare. For children with poor mental state, sleepness, abnormal EEG; lumbar puncture test with aseptic meningitis changes, doctors could give mannitol to lower intracranial pressure along with therapy for maintaining nutrition in brain and nerves. EEG would be normal in 2 weeks or occasionally last for 4 months (case 18). Most children with KD symptoms would improve after treatment, and would not have sequelae found.\n\n【36】Ce Wang", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

This patient has leukocytosis and Charcot’s triad (fever, jaundice, right upper quadrant pain), along with the ominous sign of hypotension, a clear clinical picture of cholecystitis. In addition, he has _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ sepsis and DIC. Gram-negative rod sepsis is the clear cause of this patient’s DIC, and antipseudomonal coverage with aztreonam is most appropriate. Aztreonam is a β-lactamase-resistant monobactam that interferes with cell wall biosynthesis by binding to penicillin-binding protein 3. Aztreonam is a potent antipseudomonal agent indicated for pseudomonal sepsis.  \n\n【14】Answer A is incorrect. Amoxicillin is an aminopenicillin antibiotic that interferes with cell wall synthesis. Although amoxicillin has an extended spectrum compared with penicillin (covering _Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Listeria, Proteus, Salmonella_ , and _Enterococci)_ , it does not provide antipseudomonal coverage.  \n\n【15】Answer C is incorrect. Use of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is reserved for patients with coagulopathy and signs of active, life-threatening bleeding. Although provision of FFP will temporarily reverse some of this patient’s laboratory signs of DIC (elevated International Normalized Ratio, decreased fibrinogen), treatment of the underlying cause (ie, _Pseudomonas_ sepsis) is most important.  \n\n【16】Answer D is incorrect. Vancomycin is an antibiotic used for serious multidrug-resistant, gram-positive infections. Major uses are for methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ and moderate to severe _Clostridium difficile_ infections. Its mechanism of action is to inhibit cell wall mucopeptide formation by binding the D-ala-D-ala portion of cell wall precursors.  \n\n【17】Answer E is incorrect. Coagulopathy caused by warfarin overdose is reversed by pharmacologic administration of vitamin K. This patient’s coagulopathy is caused by _Pseudomonas_ sepsis, so vitamin K therapy plays no role here.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The rash consists of nonclustering， nonblanching， raised spots > 2 mm in size spread over his buttocks and posterior surfaces of his lower extremities. The boy also complains of knee and ankle stiffness and acute abdominal pain. His vital signs are stable， and urinalysis is unremarkable.

In children， the combination of rash (as described above)， arthralgias， abdominal pain， and renal disease is pathognomonic for HSP. However， only 63% of patients with HSP actually present with abdominal pain and only 40% with renal disease. An additional 33% of patients also have evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Less common symptoms include testicular torsion， intussusception， pancreatitis， cholecystitis， and protein-losing enteropathy. Approximately 1% of children with HSP progress to end-stage renal disease， and approximately 10% of HSP cases are seen in adults.\n\n【10】**What are the dermatologic findings for this condition?**\n\n【11】Both purpura and petechiae may be seen in HSP. Purpura is characterized by nonblanching， flat lesions measuring > 2 mm in diameter. Petechiae are non-blanching， flat lesions measuring < 2 mm in diameter. Both are signs of bleeding occurring in the skin.\n\n【12】**What is the pathophysiology of this condition?**\n\n【13】HSP is a small-vessel vasculitis. Although the precipitating factor is unknown， anecdotal evidence suggests upper respiratory infection for children. With HSP， IgA deposition in blood vessels causes leaking， which leads to purpura and petechiae. This is pathophysiologically similar to IgA nephropathy.\n\n【14】Which conditions should be considered in the differential diagnosis of this patient's rash? The main concerns， in addition to HSP， are clotting disorders and sepsis； as a result， coagulation studies should be performed. A similar rash can be caused by rickettsial infections， although this patient is afebrile. It is important to distinguish HSP from hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS)， as the two conditions present similarly and can both cause extensive renal disease. However， HUS is not likely in this patient， as there are no signs of hemolytic anemia such as schistocytes on blood smear. In adults， HSP must be distinguished from systemic diseases such as hypersensitivity vasculitis and systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\n【15】**What are the appropriate treatments for this condition?**\n\n【16】Treatment is based on the severity of symptoms， as the disease is typically self-limiting. An asymptomatic patient requires no treatment. However， severe symptoms， including signs of renal involvement， may require renal biopsy and steroids. Regardless of the severity of symptoms， patients with HSP require urinalysis every 3 months for 1 year， as HSP has a high rate of recurrence. Recurrence or flares typically occur within 4 months of the initial diagnosis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Appealing to the patient's narcissism by being admiring most often de-escalates the patient as well as improves the therapeutic alliance in these cases. However， it is important to be aware that this may further inflate the narcissist's ego. Answer A (“I know this will be boring for you， but it’s just one of the things that you will have to put up with in the hospital.\") will likely cause a patient with a narcissistic personality to become angry that they are being\"belittled.Answer B (“I know you must be scared to be in the hospital， but you will be safe here.\") might also cause a narcissistic patient to perceive they are being \"talked down to. Answer D (“I understand that you think you deserve only the best， but I have been assigned to you.) might appear sarcas-tic and cause the patient to become defensive. Answer E (“Please don't make this difficult； I have to interview you as part of my job.\") would work with a reasonable person but would likely fall flat with this patient who has a need to feel special.\n\n【24】55.2 A. Patients with narcissistic personality disorder do not handle aging well because beauty， strength， and youth are often highly valued. Any blow to their fragile (but covert) self-esteem can raise their feelings of envy and anger and subsequently lead to depression. All the other life occurrences (answer B， graduation； answer C， job change； answer D，marriage； and answer E， moving to a new city) represent changes that may be stressful to people， but they do not affect those with personality disorders any differently than the general population (other than the fact that patients with personality disorders in general do not handle any kind of stressors well).\n\n【25】55.3 A. The reason is likely anger. Patients with narcissistic personality disorder rarely seek treatment and tend to have little insight into their grandiosity. When these individuals do present for treatment， it is usually due to under-lying anger or depression resulting from being belittled or not receiving the admiration to which they feel entitled.\n\n【26】55.4 B. The patient defends against his feelings of hurt and anger toward the ther-apist by using devaluation. Devaluation along with idealization and denial(answer A) are considered primitive (lower-functioning) defense mechanisms used by patients with personality disorders such as narcissistic and border-line. Because the therapist spent time in another patient's care， the narcis-sist is feeling underappreciated and is therefore envious of others. This often leads to anger. Isolation of affect (answer C) is where patients screen out painful feelings but still recall the event. Rationalization (answer D) is using logical or reason to explain away an inappropriate thought or behavior.\n\n【27】**CLINICALPEARLS**\n\n【28】Patients with narcissistic personality disorder show a pervasive sense of grandiosity， need for admiration， and entitlement in their thoughts and behavior. They are very seldom capable of true empathy with others and often manipulate them for personal gain.\n\n【29】Clinicians should try to maintain an admiring stance with these patients if possible. Tact is important as well， as these individuals handle criticism poorly.\n\n【30】Defense mechanisms in patients with narcissistic personality disorder include denial，devaluation， and idealization.\n\n【31】Pharmacotherapy is not very helpful for treating the disorder but may be helpful for comorbid conditions.\n\n【32】In bipolar patients， symptoms are episodic； there are also mood changes and functional impairments that are not seen in narcissistic personality disordered patients.\n\n【33】Patients with histrionic personality disorder have a need for attention， but it does not specifically need to be of the admiring kind， which is the case with narcissistic personality disordered patients.\n\n【34】**", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The description of the patient here is highly suggestive of fascial dehis-cence， but infection of the wound is also possible. Opening the skin incision to inspect the subcutaneous space and fascia is the most helpful choice listed here. Simple observation is not appropriate because if there is fascial disrup-tion， evisceration may occur， and early diagnosis can prevent that from occur-ring. At 12 days following her abdominal operation， a fascial dehiscence can be managed nonoperatively， therefore returning to the operating room may not be necessary.\n\n【44】30.33 A. The incidence of incisional hernia may reach 20% in infected wounds. Up to 50% of complex incisional hernia repairs can fail and result in recur-rences. Primary repairs of incisional hernias are not usually performed due to increased risk of recurrences. The development of incisional hernias are due to a number of patient-related factors (ie， patient disease or conditions) and technical factors. Incisional hernias occur less commonly in young， healthy individuals in comparison to older individuals with comorbidities.\n\n【45】_30.4_ ID. This patient presents with fluid drainage from his laparotomy incision. The concerns at this point are for fascial dehiscence or enterocutaneous fis-tula. Inspection of the fluid can be helpful to differentiate these two possi-bilities. Enterocutaneous fistula drainage has the gross appearance of enteric contents； in contrast， dehiscence is associated with the drainage of serous or serosanguinous fluid.\n\n【46】30.5A. Incisional hernias can be repaired either by open or laparoscopic approaches. The laparoscopic approach is associated with lower wound infection rate and shorter length of hospitalization； however， no signifi-cant difference in recurrence rates is reported between the two different approaches. Fascial dehiscence can be associated with fever and W BC eleva-tion when wound infection is an associated problem. Fever and leukocytosis are not always present. Patient outcomes associated with inguinal hernia repairs are significantly better than those associated with incisional hernia repairs.\n\n【47】30.6 B. Avoidance of excessive fluid administration can improve the fascial clo-sure rates for patients following damage-control laparotomies. Enteral-atmospheric fistula is a known complication associated with open abdomens. Host comorbidities have not been identified for patients at risk for having open abdomens.\n\n【48】30.7ID. The patient described here is a 43-year-old man with diabetes and a prior failed ventral hernia repair that was associated with wound infec-tion and prosthetic mesh infection. This patient falls into grade 4 with very high risk for wound complications. Based on this grading， the most appropriate choice listed is repair by component separation with biologic material reinforcement.

He notes that the hematuria becomes more prominent when he is also suffering from a respiratory infection. Which of the following is most likely to be found if the boy is diagnosed with IgA nephropathy (Berger disease)?\n\n【1】> (A) Increased antistreptolysin O titer\n\n【2】> (B) Lumpy-bumpy electron-dense deposits\n\n【3】> (C) Mesangial deposits\n\n【4】> (D) Proteinuria exceeding 3.5 gm/24 h\n\n【5】> (E) Subepithelial deposits\n\n【6】 **Answer**: The correct answer is C . IgA nephropathy (Berger disease) occurs within several days of an infection, as opposed to poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, which presents weeks afterward. Classically, patients present with a nephritic picture due to IgA deposition in the mesangium. Berger disease is the most common global nephropathy and is generally a mild disease. IgA nephropathy usually presents in children with recurrent hematuria that is of minimal clinical significance. Nonlinear mesangial deposits of IgA are evident on immunofluorescence. Treatment is with ACE inhibitors and corticosteroids. Patients with IgA nephropathy have a risk of disease recurrence.  \n\n【7】Answer A is incorrect . Increased antistreptolysin O (ASO) titers are associated with acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis rather than IgA nephropathy. The classic findings include RBCs and casts in the urine (causing the tea-colored appearance), elevated ASO titers, decreased complement levels, and “lumpybumpy” electron-dense deposits in the glomerulus.  \n\n【8】Answer B is incorrect . Acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is an autoimmune disease most frequently seen in children. It normally presents a few weeks after a streptococcal infection with a nephritic picture of peripheral and periorbital edema, dark urine, and proteinuria. These symptoms are caused by circulating antistreptococcal antibody-antigen complexes that deposit in the glomerular basement membrane, leading to complement activation and glomerular damage. The classic findings are RBCs and casts in the urine (which cause the characteristic tea-colored urine), a positive ASO titer, decreased levels of complement, and “lumpy-bumpy” electron-dense deposits in the subepithelium of the glomerulus. Recovery is spontaneous and treatment is supportive.  \n\n【9】Answer D is incorrect . IgA nephropathy usually presents with a nephritic picture, which does not involve the massive proteinuria that is seen in nephrotic syndromes.  \n\n【10】Answer E is incorrect . IgA deposition in Berger disease is primarily in the mesangium and not the subepithelium.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The patient will also need to have placement of secured intravenous access and should be transferred to an intensive care unit for mon-itoring and early upper endoscopy.\n\n【10】**Prognosis of acute variceal bleeding： This is determined by the significance of the bleeding and hemodynamic compromise that the bleeding produces. In addition， the status of the patient s liver also determines the prognosis.**\n\n【11】**ANALYSIS**\n\n【12】Objectives\n\n【13】1\\. Learn the initial management and resuscitation for patients presenting with acute variceal hemorrhage.\n\n【14】2\\. Learn the options for the definitive management of patients with gastroesoph-ageal variceal hemorrhage.\n\n【15】**Considerations**\n\n【16】This is a 46-year-old man with a known history of alcoholic cirrhosis who pres-ents with altered mental status and acute upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The patient has dried blood around his mouth and lethargy at presentation； thus，the initial concern should be directed at the patient’s airway. Most practitioners would proceed with early orotracheal intubation in this situation to prevent aspiration events. Once the airway is secured， our next priority is the assessment of hemo-dynamic status and initiation of resuscitation. Early on during the evaluation pro-cess， it is also helpful to obtain laboratory studies (complete blood count， chemistry panel including liver function tests and coagulation studies) to determine the sever-ity of the patient s liver dysfunction.\n\n【17】**The resuscitation of patients with hemorrhagic shock does not necessarily require that we restore normal vital signs and normal hemoglobin values， as recent studies suggest that restoration of normal vital signs may contribute to increased bleeding， and the resuscitation of GI hemorrhage patients to a hemoglobin target of 7 g/ dL has been shown to be associated with better outcomes than resuscitation**\n\n【18】to a target hemoglobin of 9 g/dL. Another recent trend that has evolved from trauma resuscitation practice suggests that crystalloid products should be adminis-tered sparingly during the initial resuscitation， as excessive crystalloid administra- _02_ tion can produce coagulopathy， hypothermia， and worsening bleeding. If available， we should administer blood products such as packed red blood cells， fresh frozen plasma， and platelets at a ratio of 1：1：1. When considering the causes of upper GI hemorrhage in the general population，70% of the patients have nonvariceal bleed-ing sources and 30% of the patients have variceal bleeding sources. However， in cirrhotic patients， 90%of the time bleeding is related to variceal sources. The initia-tion of pharmacologic therapy is helpful to reduce portal pressure and decrease var-iceal bleeding， and the choices of pharmacologic therapy include octreotide (bolus+ infusion)，somatostatin (infusion)， terlipressin (not available in the United States given in boluses)， or vasopressin (infusion). Prior to endoscopic verification of vari-ceal bleeding sources， it is reasonable to begin high-dose proton-pump inhibitor(PPI) treatment (omeprazole 80 mg intravenous bolus followed by 8 mg/h drip for 72 hours) which would be helpful if the bleeding source was nonvariceal in ori-gin. Because of the high rates of infectious complications encountered in patients with variceal hemorrhage， the most recent clinical guidelines recommend broad-spectrum antibiotics prophylaxis in all patients with suspected variceal hemorrhage. Based on these recommendations， we need to initiate a third-generation cephalo-sporin intravenously or oral quinolones.\n\n【19】If the patient is stabilized with our initial efforts， the next step would be to obtain an upper GI endoscopy to help identify and address the bleeding varix with variceal banding. The recommendation is to proceed with the initial endoscopy within 24 hours of hospital admission. Ifthe patient continues to bleed and remains unstable prior to endoscopy becoming available， our options include placement of a Sengstaken-Blakemore tube or another type of balloon tamponade device to temporarily control the bleeding. The balloon devices are helpful for temporary control but can only remain in place for approximately 24 hours； patients have high rebleeding rates following tube removal. At most institutions， balloon tamponade is only used to temporize the bleeding before the implementation of definitive care such as transjugular intrahepatic portal-systemic shunt (TIPS)， endoscopic ther-apy， or self-expanding intraesophageal stent placement .\n\n| **Table 20-1·CHILD-TURCOTTE-PUGH SCORE**  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Variable**  | **1 Point**  | **2 Points**  | **3 Points**  |\n| **Bilirubin level** **Albumin level** **INR** **Encephalopathy** **Ascites**  | **<2mg/dL** **\\>3.5 g/dL** **<1.7** **None** **None**  | **2-3 mg/dL** **2.8-3.5 g/dL** **1.7-2.2** **Controlled** **Controlled**  | **\\>3mg/dL** **<2.8g/dL2.2** **Uncontrolled** **Uncontrolled**  |\n\n【21】**Cass A： 5 to 6 points**\n\n【22】**Class B： 7to 9 points**\n\n【23】**Class C： 10 to 15 points**\n\n【24】**APPROACHTO：**\n\n【25】**Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding： Variceal Bleeding**\n\n【26】**DEFINITION**\n\n【27】PRIMARY PROPHYLAXIS OF VARICEAL HEMORRHAGE： This describes strategies for prevention of variceal hemorrhage in a cirrhotic patient with known gastroesophageal varices that have not previously bled. Pharmacologic prevention with noncardioselective beta-blocker (propranolol 40 mg bid initially and titrate the medication to reach a target heart rate of 50 to 55 beats/ minute) has been shown to prevent variceal bleeding. Alternatively， prophylactic variceal banding has also been demonstrated to help prevent variceal bleeding.\n\n【28】CARVEDILOL： This is a noncardio-selective beta-blocker that is often used for primary prophylaxis for variceal hemorrhage. In addition to its beta-blockage activities， this agent is a vasodilator because of its alpha-1 receptor blocking prop-erties. Hemodynamic studies suggest that this agent reduces portal pressure more effectively than propranolol.\n\n【29】**SURVEILLANCE ENDSOCOPY： There is good evidence to support initial upper endoscopy for all patients at the time of their initial diagnoses of cirrhosis； for patients with no varices seen during the initial endoscopy， surveillance endoscopy is recommended every 2 to 3 years. Patients with grade-I varices identified are recom-mended to have annual surveillance endoscopy. If the endoscopy reveals grade-II or grade-III varices or varices with red signs， the recommendation is to initiate primary prophylactic therapy with either propranolol or endoscopic banding if the patient is unable to tolerate the medication.**\n\n【30】**RED WALE SIGN： This refers to an endoscopic finding consisting of linear， red streaks that are noted on an esophageal varix； this finding is suggestive of a recent or impending bleeding. The finding represents a thinned out portion of the varix wall.**\n\n【31】**TRANSJUGULAR INTRAHEPATIC PORTOSYSTEMIC SHUNT： This is an**\n\n【32】endovascular approach that creates a portosystemic shunt within the liver paren-chyma. This approach is attractive because it does not require open surgery， and does not result in increased technical difficulties for patients who may undergo liver transplantation. The drawback of the procedure is that it can produce or worsen encephalopathy in some patients. Because the shunt is placed within the liver parenchyma， an additional limitation is restenosis and occlusion of the shunt can occur.\n\n【33】**CLINICAL APPROACH**\n\n【34】Acute GI bleeding is a common cause of hospital admissions， with bleeding in roughly 80% of the patients coming from the upper GI tract (proximal to the liga-ment ofTreitz). When all upper GI bleeding cases are considered， variceal bleeding sources are the cause of bleeding in less than 30% of these patients. Cirrhosis is a 删除换行 common problem worldwide. During the course of disease， approximately 90% of patients with cirrhosis will develop esophageal varices， and variceal hemorrhage is associated with mortality rates of 7% to 15%. The known risk factors associated with variceal bleeding include variceal diameter (>5-mm)， presence of a red wale sign， and impaired liver functions.\n\n【35】The presentation of variceal bleeding is often dramatic， with hematemesis as the most common presenting symptom. When suspected， the patient should have immediate stabilization of the airway and placed under close monitoring. Clinical and laboratory evaluations to determine the patient 's liver reserve should be under-taken . Hemodynamically unstable patients should receive fluids， blood products， and vasoactive agents for blood pressure support. The transfusion target for patients with variceal hemorrhage should be with a restrictive strategy to target a hemoglobin level of7 g/ dL， because higher levels ofhemoglobin have been demonstrated to increase portal pressures and worsen the rate of bleeding. Medical therapy has been demonstrated to help reduce bleeding， and the choices of phar-macologic therapies include somatostatin，octreotide，terlipressin， and vasopressin. Both octreotide and somatostatin have better safety profiles than terlipressin and vasopressin. High-dose PPI has not been demonstrated to provide any benefits to patients with variceal hemorrhage， and this should not be utilized except in cases 删除换行 where a nonvariceal bleeding source is suspected.\n\n【36】In 80% to 90% of the times， variceal bleeding episodes can be successfully con-trolled with endoscopic treatments. Endoscopic band ligation technique was first introduced in 1988， and it is currently the preferred endoscopic treatment for patients with bleeding varices. Endoscopic band ligation is preferred treatment over endoscopic sclerotherapy because bleeding in most cases can be controlled with a single banding session as opposed to multiple treatment sessions that are needed for the control of bleeding with sclerotherapy.\n\n【37】When available， TIPS is also very effective in controlling variceal bleeding even in patients with bleeding that is refractory to endoscopic treatments.The drawback\n\n| **Table 20-2·CLASSIFICATION OF LIVERLESIONS**  |\n| --- |\n| **Benign** **Cyst** **Hemangioma** **Focal nodular hyperplasia** **Adenoma** **Biliary hamartoma** **Abscess** **Malig nant** **Hepatocellular carcinoma** **Cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer)Gallbladder cancer** **Metastatic colorectal cancer** **Metastatic neuroendocrine cancer (carcinoid)** **Other metastatic cancers**  |\n\n【39】**Reproduced， with permission， from Brunicardi FC， Andersen DK， Billiar TR， et al.

Vitamin K catalyzes γ-carboxylation of glutamic acid residues on various proteins concerned with blood clotting. It is a fat-soluble vitamin.  \n\n【9】Answer C is incorrect. Night blindness is a consequence of vitamin A (retinol) deficiency. Vitamin A is a constituent of visual pigments and is a fat-soluble vitamin.  \n\n【10】Answer D is incorrect.

Although she falls 20% below the minimum body weight expected for her height, she doesn’t think she is skinny enough. After breaking up with her boyfriend a year ago, she dropped out of cheer-leading and has been struggling with school, although she used to be an honors student. She admits to crying spells, feeling guilty, and thoughts of suicide. Which of the following medications is contraindicated in this patient?\n\n【1】> (A) Bupropion\n\n【2】> (B) Buspirone\n\n【3】> (C) Haloperidol\n\n【4】> (D) Phenelzine\n\n【5】> (E) Sertraline\n\n【6】 **Answer**: The correct answer is A. Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by excessive dieting, excessive exercising, and body image disturbances. It is most common in adolescents and young adults. Physiologic consequences of the condition include severe weight loss, amenorrhea, lanugo (downy body hair on the trunk), melanosis coli (a blackened area on the colon as a result of laxative abuse), an increased risk of osteoporosis, mild anemia, leukopenia, and electrolyte disturbances. This patient’s amenorrhea and very low body weight indicate that she may be suffering from anorexia. She also has symptoms of depression: sadness, anhedonia, feelings of guilt, and suicidal ideation. Although she may benefit from therapy and an antidepressant medication, her electrolyte disturbances put her at risk for seizures, and contraindicate the use of bupropion, which is an atypical antidepressant. Bupropion functions as a norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor, and unlike other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, it does not carry sexual adverse effects.  \n\n【7】Answer B is incorrect. Buspirone is a serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine1A \\-receptor partial agonist used to treat depression and generalized anxiety disorder. This drug does not cause addiction or sedation, and does not interact with alcohol. Seizure is not a contraindication against its use.  \n\n【8】Answer C is incorrect. Haloperidol is a high-potency, typical anti-psychotic drug. It is a dopamine receptor antagonist used for the treatment of schizophrenia. It is not indicated for the treatment of depression. It is associated with a relatively high incidence of extra pyramidal symptoms, such as dystonia and ultimately tardive dyskinesia. However, seizure is not a contraindication against its use.  \n\n【9】Answer D is incorrect. Phenelzine is a mono-amine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor. Seizure is not a contraindication to its use. Tyramine crisis, a potentially lethal condition, may occur when patients taking MAO inhibitors ingest tyramine-rich foods (eg, certain cheeses and wine). However, it is not contraindicated in patients who have seizures.  \n\n【10】Answer E is incorrect. Sertraline is selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. It is not contra-indicated in patients with seizures.

Each case was successfully treated acutely; however, your patient is interested in trying to prevent future episodes. He is not on regular medications and has a normal physical examination today. Blood work reveals an elevated serum uric acid level and otherwise normal renal function and electrolytes. A 24-hour urine collection for uric acid reveals that he is underexcreting uric acid. Suspecting that this is the cause of his recurrent gout, you place him on probenecid.\n\n【2】 What is the mechanism of action of probenecid?\n\n【3】 Which drugs could have their excretion inhibited by probenecid?\n\n【4】ANSWERS TO CASE 8:\n\n【5】Nondiuretic Inhibitors of Tubular Transport\n\n【6】_Summary:_ A 50-year-old man with recurrent gout is prescribed probenecid.\n\n【7】 Mechanism of action of probenecid: Inhibits secretion of organic acids and decreases reabsorption of uric acid, causing a net increase in secretion.\n\n【8】 Other drugs whose secretion could be inhibited: Penicillin, indomethacin, and methotrexate.\n\n【9】#### CLINICAL CORRELATION\n\n【10】Gout is a disease in which uric acid crystals deposit in joints, causing an extremely painful acute inflammatory arthritis. Persons with recurrent gout often have chronically elevated levels of uric acid in their blood. This hyperuricemia is frequently caused by either overproduction of uric acid or underexcretion of uric acid by the kidneys. Probenecid (and other uricosuric drugs) promotes the excretion of uric acid. It works by inhibiting the secretion of organic acids from the plasma into the tubular lumen and blocking the reuptake of uric acid. The net result of this is an increase in the excretion of uric acid. The benefit of this is the prevention of recurrent gout attacks in chronic underexcreters of uric acid. In those individuals who overproduce uric acid, allopurinol or febuxostat is used. These drugs inhibit xanthine oxidase, a key enzyme in the production of uric acid. For patients with severe gout refractory to the above drugs, IV infusion of pegloticase can quickly reduce serum urate and reduce deposits in joints.\n\n【11】APPROACH TO:\n\n【12】Pharmacology of Uricosuric Agents\n\n【13】#### OBJECTIVES\n\n【14】1\\. Understand the mechanism of action of uricosuric agents.\n\n【15】2\\. Know the therapeutic uses, adverse effects, and contraindications to uricosurics.\n\n【16】3\\. Know the mechanism of action and use of allopurinol.\n\n【17】#### DEFINITIONS\n\n【18】Uricosuric agents: Increase the mass of uric acid that is excreted in the urine.\n\n【19】Renal secretion: Moves solutes such as urate from the plasma into the urine.\n\n【20】Renal reabsorption: Moves solutes from the urine back into the plasma.\n\n【21】#### DISCUSSION\n\n【22】##### _Class_\n\n【23】Urate is both secreted and reabsorbed by several independent molecular transporters located in the proximal tubule. Urate is nearly completely secreted into the lumen of the nephron against an electrochemical gradient by the action of organic acid transporter-1 (OAT-1) and organic acid transporter-3 (OAT-3). These cotransporters exchange α-ketoglutarate and urate (or other organic anions) and move urate from the plasma into the tubular cell. The protein UAT is an electrically neutral channel that permits uric acid to leave tubular cells and enter either the tubular lumen or the plasma. URAT1, located on the apical membrane of tubular cells, is thought to be responsible for most of the reabsorption of urate from the filtrate. URAT1 is a transporter that is capable of exchanging a variety of anions with urate in an electrically neutral manner. Interaction of uricosuric agents such as probenecid with URAT1 diminishes the reabsorption of urate and increases urate excretion. All of these transporters or channels are relatively nonselective with respect to the organic acid transported. OAT-1 and OAT-3 are capable of secreting most organic acids including probenecid, penicillin, aspirin, furosemide, and hydrochlorothiazide.\n\n【24】In patients with gout, probenecid can be used prophylactically; uricosuric drugs will not diminish the severity of an acute attack. An acute gouty attack may be precipitated by the initiation of probenecid treatment as uric acid is mobilized out of joints. Adequate hydration should be ensured, because probenecid predisposes patients to the formation of uric acid kidney stones.\n\n【25】Probenecid is also useful for decreasing the excretion of penicillin, because penicillin is eliminated primarily by renal secretion mediated by OAT-1 and OAT-3. Probenecid competes for this secretion and thereby reduces the rate of elimination and increases both the biological half-life of penicillin and the plasma concentration of the antibiotic more than twofold. This adjunct use of probenecid is particularly useful in single-dose regimens for the treatment of gonococcal infections with long-acting penicillins such as penicillin G.\n\n【26】Secretion of organic acids is quite nonspecific, and most acidic drugs are secreted by the same transporters OAT-1 and OAT-3. This implies that nearly any combination of acidic drugs will compete for elimination at the level of the transporters, and the effects on elimination of each individual drug must be considered. For example, the half-life of diuretics such as furosemide will be increased by probenecid, and this may require dosage adjustment. Aspirin, another acidic drug, will compete with probenecid for secretion. This reduces the action of probenecid to increase uric acid excretion and thus increases plasma urate. Therefore, aspirin is contraindicated in patients with gout who are taking probenecid.\n\n【27】The most common adverse effect of probenecid is gastrointestinal (GI) upset, and approximately 2 percent of patients experience a hypersensitivity reaction usually manifest as a skin rash. The incidence of hypersensitivity is lower with sulfinpyrazone, but the incidence of GI upset is higher.\n\n【28】The alternate therapeutic approach to the treatment of gout is to reduce the production of uric acid with an inhibitor of the enzyme xanthine oxidase. This enzyme produces uric acid in a two-step reaction from the purine hypoxanthine. Allopurinol and febuxostat are drugs used to inhibit xanthine oxidase. Allopurinol is metabolized to alloxanthine by xanthine oxidase, and this metabolite is a long-lasting inhibitor of the enzyme. Febuxostat is a more specific inhibitor of xanthine oxidase than allopurinol.\n\n【29】Uric acid accumulates in humans because we lack the enzyme uricase, which converts urate to the water-soluble allantoin. Recombinant uricase is available as pegloticase, which is administered by infusion. Pegloticase is used in severe refractory gout.\n\n【30】##### _Structure_\n\n【31】Probenecid is a lipid-soluble benzoic acid derivative with a pKa of 3.4. Another agent in this class is s ulfinpyrazone, a pyrazolone derivative similar to the anti-inflammatory agent phenylbutazone. It has a pKa of 2.8 but is no longer marketed in the United States.\n\n【32】##### _Mechanism of Action_\n\n【33】Both probenecid and sulfinpyrazone are secreted into the lumen of the nephron via OAT-1 and OAT-3 where the drugs can diminish the ability of URAT1 to reabsorb urate.\n\n【34】##### _Administration_\n\n【35】Both drugs are active orally, and both are nearly completely absorbed.\n\n【36】##### _Pharmacokinetics_\n\n【37】The half-life of probenecid is 5–8 hours; sulfinpyrazone is approximately 3 hours, but its uricosuric actions can last as long as 10 hours. Increased excretion of uric acid occurs promptly after oral administration. Both agents are eliminated in the urine.\n\n【38】####", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

It is characterized by numerous small, erythematous, teardrop-like papules and plaques with fine scale. “Guttate” refers to the teardrop appearance of the lesions and may appear as an initial presentation or exacerbation of chronic plaque psoriasis. Guttate psoriasis classically involves the extremities and trunk, and pruritus is a common symptom. Variations in reported prevalence of guttate psoriasis is closely correlated with epidemics of invasive streptococci infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Other less commonly associated risk factors include viral or fungal infections and medications such as TNF inhibitors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】Although a combination of genetic and environmental variables contribute to the disease course, the pathogenesis of guttate psoriasis is still not fully understood. There is an observed association with guttate psoriasis and a positive HLA-Cw∗0602, and it is believed that the streptococcal M-protein binds to the HLA and stimulates a T-cell response in patients with psoriasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In a case-control study of 143 patients with guttate psoriasis, those who were positive for HLA-Cw∗0602 were more likely to have a positive streptococcal throat culture than patients who were negative for the HLA-Cw∗0602 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】Diagnosis of guttate psoriasis is based on clinical examination with skin biopsy if there are any uncertainties. Histology of guttate psoriasis typically displays epidermal hyperplasia with parakeratosis, acanthosis, and a decreased granular layer. Findings are consistent with and resemble plaque psoriasis. The differential diagnosis include pityriasis rosea, tinea corporis, secondary syphilis, and pemphigus foliaceus. Fortunately, guttate psoriasis has a good prognosis, and the most common course is spontaneous remission over weeks to months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【32】Treatment\n---------\n\n【33】Due to the good prognosis and possibility of spontaneous remission, patients with guttate psoriasis may abstain from treatment. However, many patients choose to undergo treatment due to aesthetic concerns, and first line therapies include topical agents and phototherapy. The choice of treatment should be tailored to the individual patient, as there are limited studies focused on guttate psoriasis management.\n\n【34】Ultraviolet (UV) phototherapy has been indicated as first-line therapy and may accelerate the clearance of lesions in guttate psoriasis. The treatment is relatively safe and can treat large surface areas using broadband UV-B, narrowband UV-B, or psoralen plus UV-A phototherapy. Studies have shown that narrowband UV-B therapy is more effective in patients with plaque-type psoriasis and is, therefore, generally used in the treatment of guttate lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In a randomized trial, psoralen plus UV-A phototherapy was significantly more effective than narrowband UV-B, but strict photoprotection after treatment made this choice of therapy less favorable among patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. In general, phototherapy is an appealing choice of management compared to other forms of therapy due to its ease of use and effectiveness over large surface areas.\n\n【35】Although multiple topical agents including corticosteroids and vitamin D analogs have been evaluated for chronic plaque psoriasis, none of them have been specifically studied for treatment of guttate psoriasis. Guttate psoriasis can often be widespread, making application of the ointment or cream over a large area impractical. Therefore, it is recommended that topical treatments be used in conjunction with phototherapy in patients with numerous lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Corticosteroid therapy also confers the risk of skin atrophy with prolonged usage, further limiting its treatment for large surface areas.\n\n【36】Systemic treatment and antibiotics have also been utilized in the treatment of guttate psoriasis. Typically, systemic treatments with medications including cyclosporine, acitretin, methotrexate, or biologics are used for guttate psoriasis refractory to previously mentioned first line therapies. Although these treatments have shown efficacy in plaque psoriasis, there are few high-quality studies specifically studying their use in guttate psoriasis. Cyclosporine , however, has been recommended as second-line because its intermittent use falls in line with the short lived cases of guttate psoriasis and can therefore be an appropriate treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【37】While biologic medications have been increasingly utilized for the treatment of plaque psoriasis, their role in guttate psoriasis has not been well established as studies are limited to case reports. One report has described ustekinumab induced remission of recalcitrant guttate psoriasis, but further studies are necessary 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. The often transient nature of guttate psoriasis is not conducive for biologic use. Intermittent use of biologics may cause patients to develop neutralizing antibodies, reducing efficacy of future use if required 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【38】Antibiotic therapy has also been proposed as a potential management option because of the well-known association of guttate psoriasis with streptococcal infection. Antibiotics along with tonsillectomy can reduce known risk factors of recurrent streptococcus infections, but is ineffective in treating psoriasis and there is currently insufficient data to support an established practice guideline 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>.\n\n【39】The patient from the clinical scenario was started on a combination of clobetasol ointment and desonide cream for affected areas. She was also started on NB-UVB phototherapy three times a week and counseled on risks of skin damage along with DNA damage leading to possible skin cancer. Patient was to follow up in 2 months to assess outcomes of treatment.\n\n【40】Key Points\n----------\n\n【41】*   Guttate psoriasis is a variant of psoriasis with acute onset characterized by numerous small, erythematous, teardrop-shaped papules and plaques with fine scale.\n\n【42】*   The majority of guttate psoriasis begins with an inciting factor, most commonly streptococcal pharyngitis. Other causes include viral infections, fungal infections, and medication use.\n\n【43】*   Narrowband UV-B phototherapy is considered first line treatment for guttate psoriasis due to its effectiveness over large areas of involvement and due to the transient nature of the disease.\n\n【44】###", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

In severe cases, marked fissuring can lead to a “crazy pavement” appearance (eczema craquele) 删除10：<u>(Judge et al. 2010 ; Norman 2003 ; Proksch et al. 2005 ; Rapini et al. 2007 )</u>. Pruritus is often present and may be ­localized or generalized. The condition is aggravated during the winter months by low humidity, cold and windy weather, dry heat, and excessive bathing.\n\n【23】Although xerosis may be triggered by drugs or physical health problems, it is usually not associated with a systemic disease. Nonetheless, a history of preexisting diseases, conditions, therapies, and medications may contribute to making the elderly more susceptible to xerosis. Such a history may include prior irradiation, advanced renal disease, zinc or essential fatty acid deficiencies, thyroid disease, diuretic therapy, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and malignancies 删除10：<u>(Norman 2003 )</u>. Generally, a biopsy is not needed to make this clinical diagnosis.\n\n【24】Differential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【25】1.\n\n【26】Nummular dermatitis shows discrete, red, annular, scaly, dry patches on the arms and legs.\n\n【27】2.\n\n【28】Ichthyosis vulgaris is an autosomal dominant disorder, often associated with atopic dermatitis, hyperlinear palms, and keratosis pilaris (keratotic, 1–2-mm red-brown follicular papules on the upper outer arms and anterior thighs).\n\n【29】3.\n\n【30】Stasis dermatitis is an itchy, red rash of the lower extremities that is usually associated with venous insufficiency. There can be a brown hue from hemosiderin deposition under the skin.\n\n【31】Treatment\n---------\n\n【32】1.\n\n【33】Artificial humidification with a home humidifier\n\n【34】2.\n\n【35】Less frequent bathing, using warm rather than hot water, and focusing on visibly soiled skin and intertriginous areas.\n\n【36】3.\n\n【37】The use of a mild soap or cleansing cream (e.g. Dove soap, Cetaphil, Cerave) rather than harsh, antibacterial, or bar soaps.\n\n【38】4.\n\n【39】The patient should wear protective clothing in cold weather.\n\n【40】5.\n\n【41】Occlusive moisturizers (e.g. petrolatum) coat the surface of the skin, reducing the evaporative loss of moisture from the surface 删除10：<u>(Schafer-Korting et al. 1989 ; Van Scott et al. 1974 ; Wehr et al. 1986 )</u>.\n\n【42】The use of bath oils for bathing can be extremely hazardous for the elderly because of the increased possibility of slipping in the tub. Creams and moisturizers should be applied after getting out of the bathtub or shower. At that time, the body should be patted with a towel and the moisturizing preparation applied within a few minutes. Under these conditions, the skin is fully hydrated and the moisturizing preparation is more effective in preventing epidermal water loss.\n\n【43】Humectant moisturizers containing urea and lactic acid may not be tolerated because of irritation but are very effective in improving keratinocyte moisture retention and integrity. Topical corticosteroids can be selectively used if there are inflamed areas of skin (i.e. pink or red, not just dry and scaly). For many over-the-counter, all-purpose moisturizers, an inverse correlation between efficacy and cost has been demonstrated.\n\n【44】Prognosis\n---------\n\n【45】This condition tends to be chronic, but can be effectively treated with the above measures.\n\n【46】Key Points\n----------\n\n【47】*   Xerotic dermatitis is a common and chronic condition in the elderly that is defined as dry, itchy skin.\n\n【48】*   Consistent use of appropriate dry skin care regimens that include moisturizers and gentle cleansers is the cornerstone of management.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Certain bacteria are more likely to  删除换行 result in abscesses, such as staphylococci. The immune system reaction to the bacteria is  删除换行 protective and tries to prevent the infection from spreading. This results in a collection  删除换行 of bacteria, inflammatory cells, and debris. This presents as an area of fluctuance and  删除换行 pain, usually with surrounding cellulitis and overlying skin erythema and heat. There  删除换行 may also be associated systemic signs such as fever, raised inflammatory markers and  删除换行 bacteraemia. The most common causes of skin and soft tissue infection are S. aureus and \n\n【25】S. pyogenes. \n\n【26】Both S. aureus and S. pyogenes cause invasive disease and significant morbidity and mortality. \n\n【27】Invasive disease may take the form of severe spreading skin and soft tissue infection (includ删除8：<u>￾</u>ing necrotising fasciitis), disseminated infection and toxic shock syndrome. \n\n【28】Imaging of the groin should be performed to exclude deep-seated infection that may be  删除换行 present, such as a pelvic or thigh abscess or osteomyelitis. Imaging of the surrounding tissue  删除换行 is needed to exclude necrotising fasciitis if the pain is severe or cellulitis continues to spread  删除换行 despite adequate treatment. \n\n【29】S. aureus is associated with pus- and abscess-forming infection of skin and soft tissues, espe删除8：<u>￾</u>cially if medical devices such as cannulae or catheters are present. It is also the cause of sig删除8：<u>￾</u>nificant infections of bone and joints, heart and other organs to which it disseminates. A more  删除换行 serious form of infection, such as necrotising pneumonia, necrotising fasciitis, and severe  删除换行 sepsis, occurs in strains possessing the genes for Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) toxin. \n\n【30】Aside from the presence of medical devices, invasive disease does not require risk factors and  删除换行 occurs in young, otherwise healthy individuals. \n\n【31】S. pyogenes (group A streptococcus [GAS]) is most commonly associated with ‘strep throat’  删除换行 and skin and soft tissue infection such as impetigo, erysipelas and cellulitis. Less common  删除换行 complications include necrotising fasciitis, scarlet fever, rheumatic fever and post-streptococ删除8：<u>￾</u>cal glomerulonephritis. Invasive disease occurs most commonly in people with risk factors,  删除换行 such as extreme age, recent childbirth, IVDU, alcoholism, diabetes, cancer and immune  删除换行 suppression. \n\n【32】Abscesses are best treated by incision and drainage to remove the source of infection. \n\n【33】Penicillin or flucloxacillin is appropriate treatment for GAS, but MRSA will not be ade删除8：<u>￾</u>quately treated. If GAS infection is severe, the antibiotic clindamycin should be added. \n\n【34】Aside from killing the bacterium directly, it has an added effect of reducing toxin produc删除8：<u>￾</u>tion, therefore reducing much of the toxin-mediated tissue damage associated with severe  删除换行 disease. \n\n【35】MRSA is an S. aureus strain that is resistant to the ß-lactam group of antibiotics, which  删除换行 include penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems. It is often resistant to other groups of  删除换行 antibiotics such as the aminoglycosides, macrolides, and quinolones, making it more difficult  删除换行 to treat. It causes the same infections as methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA). Treatment  删除换行 for MRSA has a limited range of antibiotics, including the glycopeptides (e.g. vancomycin),  删除换行 linezolid, daptomycin, tetracyclines, fusidic acid and rifampicin, often used in combination  删除换行 to reduce the risk of further resistance developing. The patient’s antibiotic treatment should  删除换行 thus be changed to include one of these, some of which will also treat the GAS. An example  删除换行 of a treatment regimen would be vancomycin plus clindamycin. Case 99: A Groin Swelling 321 \n\n【36】MRSA colonisation and infection are also treated with a decolonisation regimen to attempt  删除换行 to reduce the burden of MRSA present and to reduce the risk of developing further infec删除8：<u>￾</u>tion. This regimen includes an antiseptic body wash and nasal application of an antibiotic  删除换行 or antiseptic. \n\n【37】Both MRSA and GAS can spread between patients and from patients to staff, causing out删除8：<u>￾</u>breaks. To prevent this, this patient should be admitted into a single room for isolation. \n\n【38】Precautions to reduce the risk of spread include the use of personal protective equipment \n\n【39】(PPE) for any health care worker having contact with her or her immediate environment. \n\n【40】The PPE includes the use of gloves and aprons and face protection if aerosols are to be gen删除8：<u>￾</u>erated, such as for wound dressings and suctioning. Hand washing with soap and water or  删除换行 decontaminating hands with an alcohol-based hand rub is recommended before and after  删除换行 contact with her or her immediate environment. \n\n【41】Among the many virulence factors of cell surface antigens, capsule, adhesins, and toxins, are  删除换行 the group known as streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins (SPE), previously called erythrogenic  删除换行 toxins. These SPE (A, B, and C) act as superantigens, in that they are able to directly and  删除换行 non-specifically stimulate T cells of the immune system, resulting in massive cytokine pro删除8：<u>￾</u>duction, leading to fever, muscle lysis, severe sepsis, and shock. In S. aureus the same process  删除换行 occurs in response to the exotoxin toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1). \n\n【42】KEY POINTS \n\n【43】• Abscesses are localised collections of pus (neutrophils) developing in response to  删除换行 bacterial infection. \n\n【44】• The most common causes of skin and soft tissue infection are S. aureus and S. \n\n【45】pyogenes.

This patient presents with deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Erythematous, warm, and tender unilateral calf swelling is classic for DVT. Risk factors for DVT and subsequent pulmonary thromboem-bolism include Virchow’s triad, which consists of stasis (eg, immobility, obesity, congestive heart failure), endothelial injury (eg, trauma, surgery, previous DVT), and hypercoagulable state (eg, pregnancy, oral contraceptive use, coagulation disorders, malignancies, smoking).

They are very knowledgeable and request more information about the specific enzyme that is defective in this disease. You explain that Tay-Sachs results from the lack of an enzyme activity necessary for which of the following?\n\n【1】A. Removal of N-acetylgalactosamine from ganglioside G <sub>M2</sub>\n\n【2】B. Addition of N-acetylgalactosamine to ganglioside G <sub>M2</sub>\n\n【3】C. Removal of the disaccharide galactose-N-acetylgalactosamine from ganglioside G <sub>M2</sub>\n\n【4】D. Addition of the disaccharide galactose-N-acetylgalactosamine to ganglioside G <sub>M2</sub>\n\n【5】E. Removal of a galactose residue from ganglioside G <sub>M2</sub>\n\n【6】**Answer**: 28.1 A . Tay-Sachs disease is the result of the lack of the enzyme β-N-acetylhexosaminidase. This enzyme hydrolyzes a terminal N _\\-_ acetylgalactosamine from the ganglioside G <sub>M2 </sub> . This ganglioside is found in high concentrations in the nervous system and is normally degraded in the lysosome by the sequential removal of terminal sugars. The lack of β-N-acetylhexosaminidase results in the accumulation of the partially degraded ganglioside in the lysosome leading to significant swelling of the lysosome. The abnormally high level of lipid in the lysosome of the neuron affects its function resulting in the disease.\n\n【7】**Question**: 28.2 Tay-Sachs disease involves the metabolism of gangliosides. Gangliosides are composed of a ceramide backbone with at least which one of the following?\n\n【8】A. Phosphorylated sugar residue\n\n【9】B. Glucose residue\n\n【10】C. Galactose residue\n\n【11】D. Sialic acid residue\n\n【12】E. Fructose residue\n\n【13】**Answer**: 28.2 D . Gangliosides are carbohydrate-rich lipids in which an oligosaccharide chain is attached to ceramide. The oligosaccharide chain must contain at least one acidic sugar such as N-acetylneuraminate or N-glycosylneuraminate. These sugars are commonly referred to as sialic acid residues. Gangliosides are synthesized by the stepwise addition of sugar residues to ceramide.\n\n【14】**Question**: 28.3 The genetic disease which results from a mutation in the gene coding for the enzyme hexosaminidase (β-N-acetylhexosaminidase) is called what?\n\n【15】A. Huntington disease\n\n【16】B. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome\n\n【17】C. Tay-Sachs disease\n\n【18】D. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\n\n【19】E. Neurofibromatosis\n**Answer**: 28.3 C . Tay-Sachs disease is the result of the lack of the enzyme β-N-acetylhexosaminidase. Affected infants show weakness and retarded motor skills before 1 year of age. Other abnormalities follow, and death usually occurs before 3 years of age.\n\n【20】BIOCHEMISTRY PEARLS\n\n【21】 Sphingolipids are a class of lipids found in biologic membranes in which the backbone of the lipid molecule is sphingosine, an 18-carbon amino alcohol.\n\n【22】 Sphingolipids are constantly being turned over in the lysosomes of cells by specific hydrolytic enzymes that remove the sugars in a stepwise fashion. Defects in these enzymes can result in accumulation of undegraded sphingolipids.\n\n【23】 This disease results from a deficiency in the enzyme hexosaminidase A (β-N-acetylhexosaminidase). The deficiency in hexosaminidase A leads to the accumulation of ganglioside G <sub>M2 </sub> in the nerve cells of the brain.\n\n【24】 Other lysosomal storage disorders include G <sub>M1 </sub> gangliosidoses, G <sub>M2 </sub> gangliosidoses, Gaucher disease, Niemann-Pick disease, Fabry disease, fucosidosis, Schindler disease, metachromatic leukodystrophy, Krabbe disease, multiple sulfatase deficiency, Farber disease, and Wolman disease.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

D： Palpate femoral pulses**\n\n【26】**Q2. C： Large ventricular septal defect**\n\n【27】**Q3. B： Cardiologist to manage medically**\n\n【28】**To answer this question we need to revisit our basic physical examination skills. A cardiovascular examination is not complete by just describing the heart murmur. Clues to the underlying heart defect will be identified form the general physical examination which may identify signs of heart failure or dysmorphic features which may increase your suspicion of the underlying defect 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>. It is of paramount importance to palpate the femoral pulses and look for brachio-femoral or radio-femoral delay to identify the presence of a co-existing coarctation of the aorta. In this case the dysmorphic features are suggestive of a baby with Down syndrome. Children with Down syndrome have a high incidence of congenital heart defects (40%). The most common defect is an atrioventricular septal defect (20%)， with ventricular septal defects (<10%)， and atrial septal defects (10%) also being relatively common 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u>. In this case the clinical features of normal heart sounds with a grade 3/6 pansystolic cardiac murmur best heard over the lower left sternal border， and widely conducted are highly suggestive of a ventricular septal defect. It is worth noting that an atrioventricular septal defect， with valve regurgitation can also present with a similar murmur . Confirmation of the diagnosis requires further investigations including a chest x-ray， ECG and echocardiogram.**\n\n【29】**Tom's normal oxyaen saturation of 95% also helps to confirm that this is a left to right shunt lesion. The history given by the parents is helpful in that the symptoms were noticed at the 6-week check-up， as is often the case with ventricular septal defects (the pulmonary vascular resistance is high in the newborn period and this limits the volume of the left to right shunt during the first few weeks of life).**\n\n【30】**The general physical examination confirms poor weight gain， tachypnoea and clear lung fields which suggest heart failure. Heart failure is a feature of a large rather than a small ventricular septal defect. Because the baby is in heart failure the initial management would include stabilisation and initiation of diuretics under guidance of the cardiologist. Further investigations would include blood chemistry and karyotype. It is likely that Tom will need an early surgical repair of the heart defect， but in the absence of a coarctation or other complex congenital cardiac malformations， surgical repair can be scheduled in the subsequent 3-4 months.**\n\n【31】**Heart Murmurs： The majority of heart murmurs heard in children are benign or innocent cardiac murmurs. These are usually short systolic murmurs grade 2/6， loudest over the lower left sternal border and the child is otherwise well. Causes of pathological murmurs are described in .**\n\n【32】**Additional Information： The majority of heart defects are multifactorial in origin with an overall prevalence of 8-10/1000 live births. However there are specific chromosomal associations as well as genetic syndromes which have a predisposition to certain types of congenital heart defects 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u>. Recognised associations include supravalvular aortic stenosis with William's syndrome， dysplastic pulmonary valve with Noonan syndrome， Truncus arteriosus and Tetralogy of Fallot with 22 q deletion and atrial septal defects with Holt-Oram syndrome. Maternal alcohol abuse as well as medications like**\n\n【33】**phenytoin during pregnancy can also lead to heart defects in the baby. Gestational diabetes during pregnancy is associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in the neonatal eriod， which usually resolves spontaneously.**\n\n【34】**The congenital heart diseases may present with cyanosis， heart failure or a combination of both.

Rarely fungi and viruses can also cause endocarditis. While evaluating children with congenital heart defects one needs to look for pointers to endocarditis like prolonged fever， splinter haemorrhages， Osler nodes， clubbing， splenomegaly and microscopic haematuria. Prompt investigations including repeated blood cultures should be obtained prior to commencing antibiotics. Maintaining good dental hygiene by regular brushing twice a day， prompt attention to dental caries， and avoiding tattoos and piercings will reduce the risk of endocarditis. All carers and older children with congenital heart defects should be counselled on these measures and also informed of the symptoms of endocarditis， especially prolonged fever (to facilitate early diagnosis).

Useful laboratory tests in those suspected of substance abuse include breath or blood alcohol tests， urine toxicol-ogy， liver enzyme tests， electrolytes， renal function， CBC，PT/INR and PTT， and vitamin deficiency screening.****Detoxification is an important first step in substance-abuse treatment with three goals： initiating abstinence， reducing withdrawal symptoms and severe complica-tions， and retaining the patient in treatment. Ongoing treatment is needed thereaf-ter to maintain abstinence. The aims are to restore normal cognitive and emotional function，to diminish cravings， and to prevent relapse. The medication also helps to make patients more receptive to the behavioral treatment and to avoid drug seeking and related criminal behavior. See Table 41-3 for substance withdrawal symptoms， medications used to treat withdrawal symptoms， long-term treatment， and relapse prevention.****Behavioral treatment is an important adjunct to addiction treatment. It helps to provide positive reinforcement to remain abstinent， to modify lifestyles related to drug abuse， and to help develop coping mechanisms to handle stressful situations. Common behavioral therapy models include cognitive behavioral therapy and the12-step model， which is used by organizations such as Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous.**", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

What is the most likely diagnosis?  |\n| --- |\n| Coarctation of the aorta occurs two to five times more often in males than in females. In this condition， which part of the aorta is typically affected?In the majority of cases， the lesion is in the descending aorta， distal to the origin of the left subclavianartery and in the periductal region. Disease course depends on the degree of obstruction after ductalclosure， the presence of collateral circulation， and any associated cardiac anomalies. Less severe formsare characterized by an isolated aortic narrowing and the presence of adequate collateral flow. Theseforms progress gradually and become symptomatic between the second and third decades of life.Severe， symptomatic disease in early infancy (< 10 days of age) occurs if the coarctation is associated withadditional cardiac anomalies and/or inadequate collateral flow to compensate for ductal closure.

Many patients develop hypertension of the upper extremities with weak， delayed femoral pulses. If thecoarctation is proximal to the point of division of the left subclavian artery， the systolic pressure in the rightarm may be greater than that in both the lower extremities and the left arm. Left ventricular hypertrophy is a common finding on ECG. X-ray of the chest often shows an indented aorta and/or notching of the inferior surface of the ribs， usuallyaround 7 years of age. This notching is the result of increased blood flow through the intrathoracic andintercostal vessels， which serve as collateral circulation.  |\n\n【3】X-ray of the chest often shows an indented aorta and/or notching of the inferior surface of the ribs， usually around 7 years of age.

{"seq_id": "d83f404b-ddb7-418e-94e0-580af5353c54", "title": null, "text": "【0】VENOUS OEDEMA\n\n【1】A hernia, irrespective of its site may be either —\n\n【2】(i) Reducible or (ii) Irreducible, (iii) Obstructed or  删除换行 incarcerated, (iv) Strangulated or (v) Inflamed.\n\n【3】When a hernia reduces itself as  删除换行 the patient lies down or can be reduced by the patient or  删除换行 by the surgeon, it is called a reducible hernia. One of the 删除换行 2 most characteristic features of the hernia is its  删除换行 reducibility. The second characteristic feature is impulse  删除换行 on coughing. When the hernia is an enterocele i.e. the  删除换行 content is small intestine, it gurgles on reduction and  删除换行 the first portion is difficult to reduce. Once reduction is  删除换行 commenced it is easily reduced particularly the last  删除换行 portion. In case of omentocele the first portion is easy to  删除换行 reduce but it is difficult to reduce the last portion. An  删除换行 uncomplicated hernia is usually a reducible hernia.\n\n【4】When the contents of the hernia  删除换行 cannot be returned back to the abdomen it is called an  删除换行 irreducible hernia. There are various causes of  删除换行 irreducibility :—\n\n【5】(i) Adhesion of its contents to each other;\n\n【6】(ii) Adhesion of its contents with the sac;\n\n【7】(iii) Adhesion of one part of the sac to the other 删除换行 part;\n\n【8】(iv) Sliding hernia;\n\n【9】(v) Narrowing of the neck of the sac due to fibrosis  删除换行 following continued use of the truss;\n\n【10】(vi) Presence of omentum in the sac often causes  删除换行 irreducibility;\n\n【11】(vii) When the content is the large intestine which  删除换行 becomes obstructed (incarcerated);\n\n【12】(viii) When there is massive hernia inside the scrotum \n\n【13】{scrotal abdomen) it often becomes irreducible.\n\n【14】Femoral and umbilical herniae are often irreducible. \n\n【15】Irreducible hernia is dangerous and may lead to  删除换行 strangulation.\n\n【16】It is 删除换行 irreducibility plus intestinal obstruction. An obstructed  删除换行 hernia means that the hernia is associated with intestinal  删除换行 obstruction due to occlusion of the lumen of the bowel. \n\n【17】The term ‘incarcerated hernia’ is often used as an  删除换行 alternative to obstructed hernia, but to be more precise  删除换行 it indicates that a portion of colon is the content of the  删除换行 sac and is blocked with faeces. It can be ascertained by  删除换行 indenting with the finger like putty.HERNIA 195\n\n【18】The features of obstructed hernia are —\n\n【19】(i) Expansile coughing impulse is not present;\n\n【20】(ii) The hernia is irreducible;\n\n【21】(iii) Patient does not complain of pairr,\n\n【22】(iv) The hernia is lax and not tender,\n\n【23】(v) Features of intestinal obstruction.\n\n【24】One must be very careful to make this diagnosis as  删除换行 against strangulated hernia. It also possesses two of its  删除换行 features i.e. irreducibility and intestinal obstruction. Of  删除换行 course the 3rd and the most important feature of a  删除换行 strangulated hernia is missing in this hernia i.e. \n\n【25】interference with the blood supply of the intestine. So it  删除换行 is a dangerous venture to diagnose obstructed hernia  删除换行 when strangulation may be the real state of affair and  删除换行 thus valuable time will be wasted until it becomes too  删除换行 late to save the patient’s life.\n\n【26】Strangulated hernia (irreducibility + obstruction + \n\n【27】arrest of blood supply to the contents). A hernia is  删除换行 said to be strangulated when the blood supply of its  删除换行 contents is seriously impaired. Ultimately the content  删除换行 becomes gangrenous. This condition develops when the  删除换行 neck of the sac is very much constricted. When the  删除换行 intestine is the content, intestinal obstruction obviously  删除换行 takes place, but intestinal obstruction may not be present  删除换行 in case of omentocele, Richter’s hernia and Littre’s hernia. \n\n【28】Although inguinal hernia is 4 times more common than  删除换行 femoral hernia, yet a femoral hernia is more likely to be  删除换行 strangulated as the femoral ring is quite tough in  删除换行 comparison to the superficial inguinal ring.\n\n【29】PATHOLOGY.— When the neck of the sac is very  删除换行 much constricted, intestinal obstruction first ensues and  删除换行 the intestine within the sac starts dilating. In case of  删除换行 enterocele the venous return is first impeded. The  删除换行 intestine becomes congested and bright red. Serous fluid  删除换行 is seen oozing out into the sac. As venous stasis increases,  删除换行 the arterial supply is also impaired. Ecchymoses appear  删除换行 in the serosa. Blood comes out into the lumen of the  删除换行 intestine as also into the fluid of the sac, so the fluid in  删除换行 the sac becomes blood stained. The serous layer loses its  删除换行 shining character and gradually becomes dull and covered  删除换行 with fibrinous exudate.\n\n【30】Gradually the intestine loses its tone and it feels flabby. \n\n【31】The vitality of the intestine diminishes and this favours  删除换行 migration of bacteria through the intestinal wall and the  删除换行 fluid within the sac becomes full of bacteria and toxins.\n\n【32】The mesentery within the sac becomes congested and  删除换行 haemorrhagic. Thrombosis of its vessels occurs.\n\n【33】Gangrene first appears at the place of constriction and  删除换行 at the antimesenteric border of the intestine. In the places  删除换行 of gangrene the colour changes from purple to black and  删除换行 ultimately to green. Gangrene may start as early as 5 to 6  删除换行 hours after the onset of first symptom of strangulation.\n\n【34】Internal strangulation is more dangerous since spreading  删除换行 peritonitis sets in from the sac.\n\n【35】CLINICAL FEATURES.— Patient first complains of  删除换行 pain and vomiting. Pain is particularly located at the  删除换行 hernial site. In case of internal strangulation it is located  删除换行 at the umbilicus. Soon pain spreads all over the abdomen  删除换行 and vomiting becomes forcible and frequent. If the  删除换行 strangulation is not relieved the paroxysm of pain  删除换行 continues. Such pain will only cease with the onset of  删除换行 gangrene and paralytic ileus. So in case of strangulated  删除换行 hernia spontaneous cessation of pain is an ominous  删除换行 symptom.\n\n【36】On examination patient is seriously ill. The hernia is  删除换行 tense and tender. Obviously the hernia is irreducible and  删除换行 there is no impulse on coughing. There are also features of  删除换行 acute intestinal obstruction in case of enterocele.\n\n【37】STRANGULATED OMENTOCELE.— The initial  删除换行 symptoms are more or less similar to those of strangulated  删除换行 enterocele. Vomiting is not so prominent feature, similarly  删除换行 the abdominal pain. The pain is localised to the hernia  删除换行 but recurrent attacks of generalised abdominal pain are  删除换行 absent. Similarly there will be no features of intestinal  删除换行 obstruction.\n\n【38】Omentum can withstand meagre blood supply for  删除换行 quite a long time, so onset of gangrene is usually delayed. \n\n【39】It first occurs in the most distal part of the omentum. \n\n【40】Once the gangrene sets in the mass gets infected and it  删除换行 becomes an inflamed hernia alongwith strangulation. In  删除换行 case of inguinal hernia such infection may even cause  删除换行 scrotal abscess.\n\n【41】STRANGULATED RICHTER'S HERNIA.—'When a  删除换行 portion of the circumference of the intestine becomes the  删除换行 content of the sac it is called Richter’s hernia. Strangula删除8：<u>￾</u>tion of such a hernia often complicates a femoral hernia  删除换行 and rarely obturator hernia.\n\n【42】Clinical features mimic gastroenteritis and diagnosis  删除换行 becomes difficult. Vomiting if present is not that frequent. \n\n【43】Unless Vi of the circumference of the bowel is involved  删除换行 intestinal obstruction may not be present. Intestinal colic  删除换行 may occur but the bowels are opened normally and there  删除换行 may be even diarrhoea. Absolute constipation may develop  删除换行 when paralytic ileus supervenes and this often is very  删除换行 much delayed.\n\n【44】For the above reasons diagnosis becomes delayed and  删除换行 operation is performed late. So during operation the  删除换行 knuckle of bowel in the sac is often gangrenous and peri删除8：<u>￾</u>tonitis has set in.\n\n【45】Maydl’s hernia (HERNIA-EN-W) or Retrograde 删除换行 strangulation.— In this condition 2 loops of bowel remain  删除换行 in the sac and the connecting loop remains within the  删除换行 abdomen and often becomes strangulated. The loops of  删除换行 intestine look like ‘W’. The loop within the abdomen196 A TEXTBOOK ON SURGICAL SHORT CASES 删除换行 becomes first strangulated and can only be suspected  删除换行 when tenderness is elicited above the inguinal ligament  删除换行 and with the presence of intestinal obstruction. The fallacy  删除换行 of this condition is that even on opening the sac the coils  删除换行 of intestine look normal. Only on traction of these loops  删除换行 one can find the strangulated loop inside the abdomen. \n\n【46】Since the strangulated loop is inside the abdomen  删除换行 generalised peritonitis may set in early .\n\n【47】When a hernia becomes inflamed  删除换行 it is called an inflamed hernia. Inflammation can occur  删除换行 from outside e.g. from an abrasion or an ill-fitting truss or  删除换行 can occur from inside e.g. when its content is an inflamed  删除换行 appendix or Meckel’s diverticulum or a salpinx. The  删除换行 diagnosis is made by the presence of constitutional  删除换行 disturbances associated with local signs of inflammation\n\n【48】— overlying skin becomes red and oedematous. The  删除换行 hernia becomes painful, swollen and tender. The only  删除换行 differentiating feature from a strangulated hernia is that  删除换行 this hernia is not tense and is not associated with intestinal 删除换行 obstruction.\n\n【49】T R EAT MEN T.—\nAn inguinal hernia is the protrusion of part of the  删除换行 contents of the abdomen through the inguinal region of  删除换行 the abdominal wall. This inguinal region is a weak part  删除换行 of the abdominal wall by the presence of the inguinal  删除换行 canal, the deep inguinal ring and the superficial inguinal  删除换行 ring.\n\n【50】The inguinal canal is a  删除换行 triangular slit almost horizontal in direction which lies  删除换行 just above the inner half of the inguinal ligament. It  删除换行 commences at the deep inguinal ring and ends at the  删除换行 superficial inguinal ring. In infant the superficial and deep  删除换行 inguinal rings are almost superimposed and the obliquity  删除换行 of this canal is slight. In adult the inguinal canal is about \n\n【51】3.75 cm (IV2 inch) long and is directed downwards and  删除换行 medially from the deep to the superficial inguinal ring. \n\n【52】This canal has been developed due to descent of testis in  删除换行 the embryonic life.\n\n【53】It is an opening in the fascia  删除换行 transversalis 1.25 cm (V2 inch) above the mid-inguinal  删除换行 point i.e. midpoint between the symphysis pubis and  删除换行 the anterior superior iliac spine. It is of an oval shape,  删除换行 the long axis being vertical. It varies in size in different  删除换行 individuals and is much larger in the male than in the  删除换行 female. At its margins the fascia transversalis is condensed. \n\n【54】Medially it is related to the inferior epigastric vessels. It  删除换行 transmits the supermatic cord -in the male and the round  删除换行 ligament of the uterus in the female.\n\n【55】It is an interval in  删除换行 the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle. It is 删除换行 situated just above and lateral to the crest of the pubis. \n\n【56】The aperture is somewhat triangular with its long axis  删除换行 oblique corresponding to the course of the fibres of the  删除换行 aponeurosis. It is smaller in the female. Its base is formed  删除换行 by the crest of the pubis and its sides by the margins of  删除换行 the opening of the aponeurosis which are called the crura 删除换行 of the ring. The lateral crus of the ring is stronger. There  删除换行 are some fibres which course at right angles to the fibres  删除换行 of the aponeurosis. Some of these fibres may arch over  删除换行 the superficial inguinal ring and are called the intercrural 删除换行 fibres. The superficial inguinal ring gives passage to the  删除换行 supermatic cord and ilio-inguinal nerve in the male and  删除换行 to the round ligament of the uterus and the ilio-inguinal  删除换行 nerve in case of females.\n\n【57】Boundaries of the inguinal canal.—\n\n【58】Anteriorly — throughout its whole length there are  删除换行 skin, the superficial fascia and the aponeurosis of the  删除换行 external oblique and in its lateral l/3rd there are the fleshy  删除换行 fibres of the origin of the internal oblique.\n\n【59】Posteriorly — the transversalis fascia along the whole  删除换行 length of the canal separates it from the extraperitoneal  删除换行 connective tissue and the peritoneum. In the medial half  删除换行 there are the conjoined tendon (combination of internal  删除换行 oblique and transversus muscles) and reflected part of  删除换行 the inguinal ligament.\n\n【60】Above — there are arched fibres of the internal oblique  删除换行 and transversus abdominis before they fuse to form the  删除换行 conjoined tendon.\n\n【61】Below or floor — is formed by the grooved upper surface  删除换行 of the inguinal ligament and its union with the fascia  删除换行 transversalis.

This condition differs from gonadotrophin-independent premature  删除换行 sexual maturation, which is caused by the abnormal secretion of sex steroids independent  删除换行 of the hypothalamo-pituitary axis. Premature sexual maturation is defined in the United \n\n【23】Kingdom as puberty commencing before the age of 8 years in females and 9 years in males. \n\n【24】In the United States, these definitions are below 7 years in Caucasian girls and below 6 years  删除换行 in Afro-Caribbean girls. There may be a family history.\n\n【25】The first sign of puberty in girls is breast development, and in boys, it is testicular enlarge删除8：<u>￾</u>ment with a testicular volume of 4 mL or more denoting the start of puberty.\n\n【26】Tracey’s puberty started at 5 years and 6 months. Sweating, body odour, acne and a height  删除换行 spurt (height velocity increases from approximately 5 cm/year prepubertally to as much as  删除换行 12 cm/year) are all part of puberty. The high height centile relative to the mid-parental centile  删除换行 and the advanced bone age all support early puberty. The LHRH test can help to diagnose  删除换行 gonadotrophin-dependent premature sexual maturation. A luteinizing hormone (LH) value \n\n【27】>7 units/L with a predominant LH response is diagnostic. The ultrasound is also in keep删除8：<u>￾</u>ing with puberty. In the majority of girls (>90 per cent), the cause is idiopathic. The earlier  删除换行 the onset of puberty, the greater will be the likelihood of there being a cause. Investigation  删除换行 should be considered in all girls below 8 years of age. The presence of neurological features  删除换行 should also prompt investigations, including a cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). \n\n【28】In a minority of girls, a hypothalamic hamartoma can lead to early puberty. Rarely, malig删除8：<u>￾</u>nant brain tumours can cause premature sexual maturation. Acquired neurological injuries,  删除换行 such as encephalitis, hydrocephalus and radiation, can also lead to early puberty.\n\n【29】In contrast, in boys, early puberty is usually secondary to a cranial lesion and MRI scanning  删除换行 is mandatory.\n\n【30】Treatment is with monthly injections of a LHRH analogue. This should halt puberty and  删除换行 may lead to some regression. Although currently tall, Tracey is at risk of premature fusion  删除换行 of her epiphysis with a short adult height. Psychosocial considerations are also an important  删除换行 indication for treatment. Coping with the emotional changes of puberty and possible early  删除换行 menarche can be difficult in young girls. In girls with mild, slowly progressive early puberty,  删除换行 no treatment may be necessary. In boys, treatment is also with a LHRH analogue. Any under删除8：<u>￾</u>lying lesion should also be treated.

The teacher has noticed the child frequently makes long-winded speeches about boats in class and is often rocking back and forth in his seat. On further history taking, the child’s mother states that he is very independent with few friends, and has always been interested in boats, preferring them over all other toys. You observe that his speech is monotone and restricted in volume and rate and he never makes eye contact with you or his mother. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this child?\n\n【1】A. An Asperger-specific screening tool appropriate for the child’s age is the next important step.\n\n【2】B. The most important issue for today’s visit is to administer vaccinations the child is missing.\n\n【3】C. This child should be started on oral amphetamine-like compounds, which will likely lead to much improved behavior.\n\n【4】D. This parent should be reassured, as this child’s behavior and development is most likely a variant of normal.\n\n【5】E. It is probable that one of the vaccinations is responsible for this child’s clinical findings.\n\n【6】**Answer**: 54.1 A . While at first glance the concerns of this child’s teacher and mother may sound typical for ADHD, your clinical suspicion should be that the child has Asperger syndrome, based on a history of monotone, restricted speech limited to only one topic of interest, lack of eye contact, lack of peer relationships appropriate to developmental age, and the repetitive, nonfunctional, atypical behavior of rocking and twirling. Appropriate steps at this time include a complete history and physical examination accompanied by an Asperger-specific screening tool and immediate referral to a developmental pediatrician for a complete evaluation. You should reassure the child’s mother that immunizations are not implicated in the cause of developmental disorders and administer any vaccines needed. You should not delay your diagnostic workup for a developmental disorder for any reason. Although immunizations are important, for this child’s situation, evaluation of the developmental problems is of higher priority.\n\n【7】**Question**: 54.2 Which of the following statements is accurate?\n\n【8】A. A previously healthy, normally developing 3-year-old child begins to lose bladder control and will no longer speak in sentences, but you should not be too concerned because this began after the birth of her younger sibling and she just wants more attention from her parents.\n\n【9】B. No use of single words by 12 months of age in a child is reason for immediate referral to speech therapy.\n\n【10】C. Children with ASDs will rarely grow up to be independent adults.\n\n【11】D. You counsel the parents of a 6-year-old son with autism that their second child is at increased risk for having an ASD.\n\n【12】**Answer**: 54.2 D . Family studies estimate a recurrence risk of as much as 5% to 6% when there is an older sibling with an ASD. Red flag symptoms indicating the need for an immediate evaluation for an ASD include loss of language or social skills at any age and no use of single words by 16 months of age. Although most children with an ASD will retain their diagnosis and exhibit residual signs of their disorder into adulthood, children with ASDs who begin treatment at a younger age have significantly better outcomes, and one of the goals of treatment is to foster independence.\n\n【13】**Question**: 54.3 Which of the following observations during a clinical examination is concerning for the presence of an ASD?\n\n【14】A. You walk into the examination room and find a 36-month-old child pretending to have tea with her imaginary friend.\n\n【15】B. A 12-month-old child walks over to the sink, and points toward the faucet, but only utters, “Uh,” and does not say water.\n\n【16】C. A 2-year-old child is holding tightly to a tattered old blanket, which his mother says he will not leave the house without.\n\n【17】D. You tap an 18-month-old child on the shoulder, say, “Look!” and point to a toy in the corner of the room, but the child ignores you and continues to spin the wheels on his toy car.\n**Answer**: 54.3 D . The child in answer choice (D) demonstrates a deficit in joint attention, one of the most distinguishing characteristics of very young children with ASDs. It is the lack of pretend play skills, rather than their presence choice (A), that is concerning for an ASD. As demonstrated in answer choice (B) at about 12 to 14 months of age, a typically developing child will begin to request a desired object that is out of reach by pointing, and, depending on the child’s speech skills, may utter simple sounds or actual words. Similar to answer choice (C), most children will form attachments during their early development with a stuffed animal, special pillow, or blanket. However, children with ASDs may prefer hard items such as ballpoint pens, keys, or flashlights.\n\n【18】CLINICAL PEARL\n\n【19】 Common features shared by all the ASDs include severe deficits in social skills and limited, repetitive, and stereotyped behavior patterns. However, only AD and PDD-NOS are characterized by significant language delays.\n\n【20】 Red flag symptoms indicating the need for immediate evaluation for an ASD include: no babbling or pointing by 12 months, no single words by 16 months, no 2-word phrases by 24 months, and loss of language or social skills at any age.\n\n【21】 When a child demonstrates two or more risk factors or a positive screening result occurs, take immediate action.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Additionally， the patient has previously undiagnosed hypothyroidism.\n\n【6】·Most likely diagnosis： Left slipped capital femoral epiphysis.\n\n【7】· Historical risk factors： Obesity， male， African American， adolescence， with concomitant endocrinopathy (hypothyroidism).\n\n【8】· Next appropriate step： Percutaneous screw fixation.\n\n【9】**ANALYSIS**\n\n【10】_Objectives_\n\n【11】1\\. Recognize the presentation of SCFE.\n\n【12】2\\. Understand the workup for SCFE and patient population.\n\n【13】3\\. Be familiar with the treatment for SCFE and its potential long-term complications.\n\n【14】**_Considerations_**\n\n【15】This is an overweight， African American male adolescent with a history of pain in his left knee. Up to 46% of patients with SCFE will present initially with complaints of distal thigh or knee pain. It is essential to recognize that hip pathology can often be referred to the distal thigh or knee. Complaints of knee pain should warrant complete and thorough physical exam， and typically radiographic evaluation， of the ipsilateral hip. Patients with SCFE typically present with an externally rotated， subtly foreshortened lower extremity， with a markedly decrease range of painful internal rotation.\n\n【16】Hip x-rays should include， at a minimum， an AP view of the pelvis as well as lateral views of each femoral head and neck， typically achieved through a frog-leg lateral view. Although this patient's SCFE is clearly visible on both AP and lateral films， early SCFE lesions are often subtle and are generally apparent on lateral views before they are obvious on the AP.\n\n【17】Patients with newly diagnosed SCFE lesions should be immediately made non-weightbearing on the effected extremity. Complete workup for SCFE secondary to underlying medical conditions should be performed， including initial labora-tory testing for TSH， a complete metabolic panel， and a complete blood count. Patients undergoing potential operative fixation should always receive blood type and screening and coagulation (prothrombin time/partial thromboplastin time) studies.\n\n【18】**APPROACH TO：Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis (SCFE)**\n\n【19】**DEFINITIONS**\n\n【20】OSTEONECROSIS： The cellular death of bone， typically resulting from a pro-longed disruption of blood supply.\n\n【21】STABLE SCFE： Defined simply by the patient's ability to ambulate， even with crutch assistance. Less than 10% of patients with a stable SCFE develop osteonecrosis.\n\n【22】UNSTABLE SCFE： Defined as SCFE in patients who are unable to ambulate. These patients have a high incidence of osteonecrosis， upward of 50%.\n\n【23】SCFE (often pronounced“skiffy\") is a disorder of adolescence in which a fracture or， technically， a disruption-occurs through the growth plate of the femoral head. The epiphysis， or region of developing bone above the growth plate (physis)， is therefore mobile and tends to“slip”from the neck of the femur under the repetitive loading of body weight. The“slipping”process is actually a misnomer， however， as it is not technically the epiphysis that slips from the femur， but rather the femur that displaces from the anatomically stable epiphysis.\n\n【24】_Epidemiology_\n\n【25】SCFE typically affects children between 10 and 17 years of age， occurring at an average of 13.4 years for boys and 12.2 years for girls. Its prevalence in the United States is 10 in 100，000 people annually. SCFE has a slight male-to-female predomi-nance of 3：2 and occurs at increased incidences of 2.2 in patients of African ances-try， 4.5 in those of Pacific Islander ancestry， and 0.1 for North African and Indian subcontinental ancestry， versus 1.0 for white controls. Racial differences are closely related to average adolescent body weights.\n\n【26】_Pathogenesis_\n\n【27】As stated， SCFE is a failure of the physis， with separation of the epiphysis from the proximal femoral metaphysis. Biomechanical factors such as obesity， femoral retro-version (increased posterior angulation of the femoral neck)， and increased physeal obliquity (an increasingly angulated growth plate that is vulnerable to shearing forces when body weight is loaded) all contribute to physeal weakening. In younger chil-dren， the physis is protected by a perichondral ring that resists shearing forces. This protective ring weakens in adolescence， however， and increases the risk of SCFE. SCFE occurs during puberty， when rapid cellular expansion is occurring at the physeal zone of hypertrophy. Failure is thought to occur at this slightly weakened zone of rapid， immature expansion. Finally， hormonal and endocrine changes are associated with SCFE， but the mechanisms by which they contribute to the disease process are not fully understood. There are data to show that hypothyroidism， growth hormone supplementation， and hypogonadism increase one's risk of SCFE.\n\n【28】_Radiology_\n\n【29】The direction of a typical“slip”causes the femur to fall into varus， extension， and external rotation. Typically， the epiphysis tends to move posteriorly first， a trans-lation that is most apparent on frog-leg lateral views. With the femurs externally rotated， abducted， and flexed， an unobstructed lateral view of the femoral neck shows early posterior displacement of the epiphysis. For this reason， frog-leg lateral images are considered most sensitive for the diagnosis.\n\n【30】Several radiographic measurements can be made to diagnose and grade SCFE. The Klein line， or a line drawn parallel to the superior femoral neck， should inter-sect the epiphysis in normal individuals. In patients with advanced slips， however， the Klein line contacts the edge of， or is superior to， the migrating epiphysis. The metaphyseal blanch sign of Steel is a blurring of the proximal femoral metaphysis that may be visualized on an AP pelvis film. This is caused by overlapping of the normal metaphysis with the posteriorly displaced epiphysis.\n\n【31】Although several classification schemes exist， the most practical and prognosti-cally relevant classification divides the disease into stable and unstable SCFE. SCFE stability is defined simply by whether or not the patient is able to tolerate weightbearing on the affected extremity. Stability includes those who are able to partially weight bear with crutches. Patients with unstable SCFE are so uncom-fortable with movement of the hip that they refuse to ambulate. Up to 50% of patients with unstable SCFE have an incidence of osteonecrosis of the femoral head.\n\n【32】Intervention should occur as soon as the diagnosis is made. For patients with mild or moderate stable disease， in situ fixation is the method of choice. Attempts to forcefully reduce the deformity are not recommended； however， sometimes the slip will spontaneously reduce or improve when the patient is positioned for surgery. Regardless， the goal or treatment is to stabilize the slipped epiphysis， as remodeling often occurs and patients cntS Can tolerate a certain degree of residual external rota- tion. Single-screw percutaneous fixation is the most common mode of treatment， although double-screw fixation techniques are sometimes performed. For single-screw fixation， the goal is to place the screw through the middle of the epiphy-sis and perpendicular to the growth plate. Patients with stable slips are typically allowed to bear weight after fixation. Bilateral fixation may be indicated in patients with underlying endocrinopathies， even if the contralateral hip is asymptomatic and without radiographic evidence of the disease. Although controversial， some authors also advocate for the prophylactic pinning of the contralateral hip in children less than 10 years of age with unilateral SCFE or in those with open triradiate cartilage. The impetus behind prophylactic fixation of the unaffected hip stems from the elevated rates at which young children and patients with endo-crinopathies develop bilateral disease.\n\n【33】In patients with unstable SCFE， there is significant controversy over whether reduction manipulations should be employed versus in situ SUs 1fixation， whether cap-sulotomy or arthrocentesis should be performed versus no joint decompression， and whether single- versus multiple-screw fixation techniques should be used. Most sur-geons advocate relatively urgent treatment in these patients， as greater than 24 hours between acute injury and fixation may be associated with increased risk of osteo-necrosis. A common treatment regimen for unstable SCFE involves single-screw fixation after joint aspiration to relieve intracapsular pressure and promote vascular perfusion. These patients are generally made nonweightbearing with crutches for6 to 8 weeks postoperatively.\n\n【34】_Complications_\n\n【35】Osteonecrosis is a severe， debilitating complication， for which risk is increased with unstable SCFE， delayed surgical fixation of acute unstable SCFE， attempted reduc-tion manipulations， and improper placement of pins， specifically in the posterior-superior femoral neck， leading to disruption of vasculature. Osteonecrosis is initially managed with nonweightbearing， nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs， and gentle range-of-motion exercises. When severe， however， reconstructive intervention may be necessary. Slip progression after initial fixation is another potential complica-tion that， fortunately， occurs in only 1% to 2% of patients after single-screw fixa-tion. Although double-screw fixation may theoretically reduce this complication， elevated potential risks of osteonecrosis with multiple-screw fixation favors single-screw techniques for most surgeons.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The therapist had much greater difficulty eliciting change talk for some of these behaviors. For example, though Jason recognized that his hand washing was excessive and problematic, he reported that picking crumbs, hair, and lint off of his carpet was “the right thing to do.” These symptoms were congruent with Jason’s underlying desire for orderliness and would be considered “ego-syntonic.” Through treatment, Jason was able to gradually reduce these behaviors, but they were not entirely eliminated. This case highlights the importance of investigating OCPD traits as complicating factors in E/RP treatment, especially in terms of treatment motivation 删除10：<u>(Pinto et al. 2008 )</u>.\n\n【3】Conclusions and Practice Points\n-------------------------------\n\n【4】Psychotherapy involving E/RP has the potential to substantially improve the lives of individuals with OCD, though problems with motivation can result in a failure to maximally benefit from this treatment. Limited motivation can manifest as reluctance, not only to starting E/RP but also to progressing through increasingly anxiety-provoking exposures. Among several techniques that show promise to enhance motivation for E/RP, MI offers practitioners one approach to enhance motivation and facilitate treatment.\n\n【5】Consistent with the view that reluctance for change and treatment stems from underlying ambivalence, MI suggests that therapists avoid confrontation and argumentation during treatment, instead suggesting that they defuse discord by supporting patient autonomy and expressing understanding and acceptance of the patient’s conflicting feelings about treatment and change. A central component of MI is the notion that people learn what they think in part by hearing themselves speak. MI encourages patients to talk about the importance of change by highlighting the discrepancy between current behaviors and the patient’s important life goals and values. MI practitioners also attempt to elicit talk of confidence in the ability to change by highlighting and fostering patient self-efficacy.\n\n【6】In the case of Jason, problems with limited motivation became evident through nonadherence to homework and reluctance to take on some exposures. MI-congruent strategies, particularly reflective listening, articulating values, highlighting discrepancy, and decisional balance discussions proved helpful at enhancing Jason’s willingness to fully participate in treatment, while also bolstering his sense of self-efficacy. Once Jason committed to change, treatment progressed rapidly and his symptoms were significantly reduced.\n\n【7】The case history presented here illustrates how limited motivation can be targeted in adults with OCD, highlighting MI, one of several strategies that have been used to enhance motivation. Other strategies include cognitive techniques and readiness therapy, in addition to modifications that can be made within the E/RP protocol itself. Optimal treatment should be tailored to each individual’s presenting concerns and could include a combination of these motivational enhancement techniques for patients with limited motivation for treatment.\n\n【8】Importantly, though some empirical research has been done on the topic of motivation for treatment in OCD, substantial questions remain. In particular, no studies have directly compared different motivational-enhancement techniques, or systematically evaluated how best to integrate such efforts with E/RP (i.e. as a stand-alone treatment before E/RP entry or interwoven within standard E/RP). Future research is also necessary to determine which interventions are most effective at improving patient adherence to E/RP treatment and whether this improved patient adherence then causally leads to improved treatment outcome. Finally, the case reviewed here was relatively straightforward. In other instances, E/RP treatment can be complicated by factors such as poor insight and other forms of comorbidity (e.g. severe depression). It is not clear if MI is effective in these cases, again highlighting the need for greater research on motivational enhancement in conjunction with OCD treatment.\n\n【9】Key Practice Points\n-------------------\n\n【10】*   Limited motivation may interfere with the ability of some OCD patients to adhere to E/RP treatment, limiting their ability to fully benefit from this treatment.\n\n【11】*   MI aims to increase motivation for change and willingness to fully participate in treatment.\n\n【12】*   An MI approach aims to resolve ambivalence in favor of patients’ intrinsic motivation for change.\n\n【13】*   Specific MI strategies including eliciting change talk, defusing discord, and highlighting discrepancy between the patient’s current behaviors and important goals and values.\n\n【14】*   Strategies derived from an MI approach can be used alongside E/RP procedures and may help enhance adherence to this treatment for some individuals.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), previously called congestive heart failure due to its prominent clinical feature of fluid volume overload, or congestion, is defined as “a clinical diagnosis of heart failure with an ejection fraction <40%” and is often associated with left ventricular enlargement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. A proposed universal definition of HFrEF qualifies the diagnosis as a clinical syndrome that includes symptomatic HF with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40% and presence of either elevated natriuretic peptides (i.e. brain natriuretic peptide \\[BNP\\]) or objective evidence of pulmonary or systemic congestion, i.e. via right heart catheterization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) represents approximately half of patients diagnosed with HF. HFpEF is currently defined as an LVEF ≥50% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Treatment for HFpEF is available and addressed in a subsequent chapter. Heart failure with mildly reduced or midrange ejection fraction (HFmrEF) is defined as LVEF 41–49% with evidence of spontaneous or provoked increase in left ventricular filling pressures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Patients with HFmrEF may benefit from similar therapies used in the treatment of HFrEF. Patients with HFrEF may have improvement in LVEF following implementation of goal-directed medical therapies (GDMT); however, these patients often continue to have changes in cardiac structure and function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Guideline-directed medical therapy should be continued in this subset of patients with HFrEF despite improvements in ejection fraction.\n\n【15】In this chapter, the epidemiology, etiology, diagnostic testing, GDMT, and device options for management of HFrEF will be presented.\n\n【16】6.2 Epidemiology\n----------------\n\n【17】A predominant cause of HFrEF is coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction (MI) although numerous other causes can result in left ventricular dilation and enlargement. Heart failure incidence and prevalence increases with advancing age and, based on the most recent data, approximately six million people ≥ age 20 have HF. Prevalence is expected to increase 46% by the year 2030 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Older adult women (≥ age 80) and black men and women demonstrate the highest prevalence of heart failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Of heart failure hospitalizations, 50% are related to HFrEF. Heart failure is a chronic and progressive syndrome and 15–20% of patients diagnosed with HFrEF will develop worsening heart failure within 18 months of diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Additionally, hospitalization due to HF exacerbation increases mortality risk by approximately 10% for each hospitalization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】6.3 Etiology\n------------\n\n【19】Heart failure can occur because of diseases of the pericardium, myocardium, endocardium, heart valves, coronary arteries, and/or certain metabolic or infectious disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Etiology is often categorized into two classifications of cardiomyopathy (CMP): ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) and nonischemic cardiomyopathy (NCIM) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The term dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is frequently used synonymously with NICM; however, the term DCM does not encompass all causes of NICM. Older studies examining outcomes of patients with HFrEF due to ICM versus DCM were mixed and the relationship between the etiology of HFrEF and outcome was unclear 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Patients with ICM or NICM can develop HFrEF. A data analysis of the Prospective Comparison of Angiotensin-receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) with Angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and Morbidity in Heart Failure (PARADIGM-HF) trial demonstrated no differences in cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization between ICM and NICM groups when controlled for New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, and demographic, risk, and comorbid factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】Cardiomyopathy can be classified according to anatomic or functional features . Coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction (MI) cause myocardial remodeling and myocyte hypertrophy and destruction, resulting in ICM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Dilated cardiomyopathy occurs as a consequence of myriad disorders affecting the heart where the end result of the disease process is damage to the myocardium manifested as ventricular dilation and reduced myocardial contractility in the absence of hypertension or valvular disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 10 \\]</u>. Other types of NICM occur as the result of processes that cause myocyte damage, infiltration, or fibrosis of myocardial tissues causing myocardial stiffening and restriction, or a thickening and hypertrophy of the myocardium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】Table 6.1\n\n【22】Classification of cardiomyopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 9 – 13 \\]</u>\n\n| Classification by disease type/phenotype  | Etiology  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM)  | Coronary artery disease  |\n| Ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM)  | Myocardial infarction  |\n| Nonischemic(NICM)/dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)  | Idiopathic  |\n| Nonischemic(NICM)/dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)  | Familial/genetic  |\n| Nonischemic(NICM)/dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)  | Hypertension  |\n| Nonischemic(NICM)/dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)  | Toxins:  |\n| Nonischemic(NICM)/dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)  | • Alcohol  |\n| Nonischemic(NICM)/dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)  | • Cocaine  |\n| Nonischemic(NICM)/dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)  | • Chemotherapy, i.e. anthracyclines  |\n| Nonischemic(NICM)/dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)  | • Ephedra, methylphenidate  |\n| Nonischemic(NICM)/dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)  | • Anabolic steroids  |\n| Nonischemic(NICM)/dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)  | • Thoracic radiation  |\n| Nonischemic(NICM)/dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)  | Nutritional:  |\n| Nonischemic(NICM)/dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)  | • Anorexia nervosa  |\n| Nonischemic(NICM)/dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)  | • Thiamine deficiency  |\n| Nonischemic(NICM)/dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)  | • Obesity  |\n| Nonischemic(NICM)/dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)  | Dystrophinopathies:  |\n| Nonischemic(NICM)/dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)  | • Duchenne muscular dystrophy  |\n| Nonischemic(NICM)/dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)  | • Becker’s muscular dystrophy  |\n| Nonischemic(NICM)/dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)  | Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy  |\n| Nonischemic(NICM)/dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)  | LV noncompaction (LVNC)  |\n| Nonischemic(NICM)/dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)  | Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC)  |\n| Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)  | Idiopathic  |\n| Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)  | Familial/genetic  |\n| Restrictive/infiltrative cardiomyopathy  | Amyloidosis  |\n| Restrictive/infiltrative cardiomyopathy  | Sarcoidosis  |\n| Restrictive/infiltrative cardiomyopathy  | Connective tissue disease:  |\n| Restrictive/infiltrative cardiomyopathy  | • Lupus erythematosus  |\n| Restrictive/infiltrative cardiomyopathy  | • Scleroderma  |\n| Restrictive/infiltrative cardiomyopathy  | • Hemochromatosis  |\n| Valvular cardiomyopathy  | Mitral, tricuspid, pulmonary, or aortic valve disease  |\n| Valvular cardiomyopathy  | Rheumatic heart disease  |\n| Peripartum cardiomyopathy  | Pregnancy or postpartum associated heart failure  |\n| Inflammation or infection  | Viral myocarditis:  |\n| Inflammation or infection  | • Coxsackie  |\n| Inflammation or infection  | • Parvovirus  |\n| Inflammation or infection  | • Adenovirus  |\n| Inflammation or infection  | • Echovirus  |\n| Inflammation or infection  | • Influenza  |\n| Inflammation or infection  | • HIV  |\n| Inflammation or infection  | • SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19)  |\n| Inflammation or infection  | Protozoal infection:  |\n| Inflammation or infection  | • Chagas disease  |\n| Inflammation or infection  | Spirochete infection  |\n| Inflammation or infection  | • Syphilis  |\n| Inflammation or infection  | Giant cell myocarditis  |\n| Metabolic/endocrine disorders  | Diabetes mellitus  |\n| Metabolic/endocrine disorders  | Hyperthyroidism  |\n| Metabolic/endocrine disorders  | Hypothyroidism  |\n| Stress-induced cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo)  | Physical or emotional stress (catecholamine surge)  |\n\n【24】_LV_ left ventricle, _HIV_ human immunodeficiency virus\n\n【25】6.4 Prevention\n--------------\n\n【26】A multitude of risk factors and disease processes increase the possibility a person will develop heart failure.

Asymptomatic adults aged 40–75 should be screened; screening adults > age 20 every 4–6 years should be considered. Eight primary preventive measures have been shown to avert ASCVD events leading to HF progression and include weight reduction if overweight or obese (BMI ≥ 25.9 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> ), increased physical activity, blood pressure, cholesterol and glycemic control, smoking cessation, adherence to a healthy diet, and renal function monitoring, as well as implementation of guideline-based pharmacologic interventions for management of comorbidities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 , 16 \\]</u>. Family history of premature ASCVD (age < 55 males, age < 65 females); metabolic syndrome; chronic kidney disease; chronic inflammatory conditions, e.g. lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, HIV/AIDS; history of premature menopause (< age 40); history of preeclampsia; high-risk race or ethnicity (South Asian ancestry); hypertriglyceridemia; extracardiac vascular disorders, e.g. erectile dysfunction, claudication, or peripheral arterial vascular disease (PAD) are factors that revise a patient’s 10-year ASCVD risk estimation and should be included in patient assessment.

She also reports an unusual odor to her urine and some areas of hypopigmentation on her skin and hair. On examination, the girl is noted to have some muscle hypotonia and microcephaly. The urine collected is found to have a “mousy” odor.\n\n【3】 What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【4】 What is the biochemical basis of the hypopigmented skin and hair?\n\n【5】### ANSWERS TO CASE 38:\n\n【6】#### Phenylketonuria\n\n【7】_Summary:_ A 1-year-old girl born outside the United States with developmental delays, hypotonia, hypopigmentation, and foul smelling urine.\n\n【8】• Likely Diagnosis: Phenylketonuria (PKU)\n\n【9】• Biochemical basis of hypopigmentation: Phenylalanine is competitive inhibitor of tyrosinase (key enzyme in melanin synthesis)\n\n【10】### CLINICAL CORRELATION\n\n【11】Elevated phenylalanine can be caused by a variety of different enzyme deficiencies resulting in impaired conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine. The most common deficiency is in phenylalanine hydroxylase (autosomal recessive) resulting in the classic picture of PKU. Two other enzyme deficiencies leading to PKU include dihydropteridine reductase and 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase, an enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of tetrahydrobiopterin. With PKU, the baby appears normal at birth but then fails to reach normal developmental milestones. If unrecognized, the child will develop profound mental retardation and impairment of cerebral function. A mousy odor of the skin, hair, and urine can often be detected clinically. Areas of hypopigmentation develop secondary to the disruption of melanin synthesis. In the United States, all children are screened for PKU in hopes to prevent the serious life-long complications. Treatment consists of dietary modifications with limitation of phenylalanine intake and supplementation of tyrosine. The diagnosis of PKU and initiation of diet modification must be implemented prior to 3 weeks of age to prevent mental retardation and the other classic signs of PKU.\n\n【12】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【13】#### Phenylketonuria\n\n【14】### OBJECTIVES\n\n【15】1\\. Describe the biochemical conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine.\n\n【16】2\\. Describe the biochemical events that occur when conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine is inhibited.\n\n【17】### DEFINITIONS\n\n【18】HYPOPIGMENTATION: Lack of color in skin or hair due to the absence or low quantity of the skin and hair pigment melanin, a product of tyrosine (and phenylalanine) metabolism.\n\n【19】TETRAHYDROBIOPTERIN: A 4-electron-reduced form of the reducing agent biopterin required to supply electrons to phenylalanine hydroxylase for conversion of phenylalanine to its hydroxylated product, the amino acid tyrosine.\n\n【20】PHENYLKETONURIA: The presence of elevated amounts of phenylketones—primarily phenylpyruvate—in urine; a primary indication of disturbance of phenylalanine metabolism resulting from elevated transamination of phenylalanine due to reduction in phenylalanine hydroxylation to tyrosine.\n\n【21】### DISCUSSION\n\n【22】Phenylketonuria is a disease readily diagnosable in childhood, and it is important for an optimal clinical outcome for it to be diagnosed as early as possible. Laboratory tests can be performed in the neonatal period and now genetic testing can identify the trait before birth.\n\n【23】Phenylketonuria obtains from an elevated level of phenylpyruvate in the urine of the patient. As shown in Figure 38-1 , phenylpyruvate is the cognate α-ketoacid of the amino acid phenylalanine. It is formed by transaminating phenylalanine and α-ketoglutarate to yield glutamate and phenylpyruvate. This reaction is freely reversible; therefore, it is driven by elevated concentrations of reactants or products. For large scale conversion of phenylalanine to phenylpyruvate an increase in the concentration of phenylalanine must occur to drive the transamination reaction toward the formation of phenylpyruvate. Such an elevated phenylalanine level will be reflected in the blood as hyperphenylalaninemia, which is defined as a plasma phenylalanine level above 120 μmol/L. The most likely cause is a disturbance in the phenylalanine hydroxylase reaction.

As shown in Figure 38-2 , the phenylalanine hydroxylation reaction is the pathway whereby dietary phenylalanine can be converted into tyrosine relieving some of the dietary requirement for tyrosine. It is catalyzed by phenylalanine hydroxylase, a monooxygenase requiring molecular oxygen and a specific 2-electron donor tetrahydrobiopterin. One atom of molecular oxygen appears in the product tyrosine as a hydroxyl group in the para position, the remaining oxygen atom appearing in the product water.\n删除3：<u>Figure 38-2. Normal conversion of phenylalanine into the amino acid tyrosine catalyzed by phenylalanine hydroxylase.</u>\n\n【25】The provision of reducing equivalents to phenylalanine hydroxylase is dependent on reduction of dihydrobiopterin by NADH catalyzed by the enzyme dihydropteridine reductase . This reduction is dependent on the availability of biopterin and therefore on the biopterin synthetic pathway. Thus, any genetic or protein folding defect in either dihydropteridine reductase or the biopterin biosynthetic enzymes would compromise the efficacy of phenylalanine hydroxylation to tyrosine resulting in hyperphenylalaninemia and also phenylketonuria resulting from increase transamination of phenylalanine to phenylpyruvate.\n\n【26】The principal enzyme in this pathway is phenylalanine hydroxylase. The gene for phenylalanine hydroxylase is located on chromosome 12 at band region q 23.2 and comprises 100 kb of genomic DNA. Several hundred alleles causing disease states have been recognized for this gene, more than 60% of which are classified as missense alleles. European and Chinese populations show 1 order of magnitude higher incidence than persons of African descent. This population specific expression of disease causing alleles may explain the wide range of incidence reported for this disease entity (5-350 cases/million live births).\n\n【27】##### _Fates of Tyrosine_\n\n【28】Tyrosine can be degraded by oxidative processes to acetoacetate and fumarate which enter the energy generating pathways of the citric acid cycle to produce CO <sub>2 </sub> and ATP as indicated in Figure 38-2 . Tyrosine can be further metabolized to produce various neurotransmitters such as dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. Hydroxylation of tyrosine by tyrosine hydroxylase produces dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA). This enzyme, like phenylalanine hydroxylase, requires molecular oxygen and tetrahydrobiopterin. As is the case for phenylalanine hydroxylase, the tyrosine hydroxylase reaction is sensitive to perturbations in dihydropteridine reductase or the biopterin synthesis pathway, any one of which could lead to interruption of tyrosine hydroxylation, an increase in tyrosine levels, and an increase in transamination of tyrosine to form its cognate α-keto acid, para-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, which also would appear in urine as a contributor to phenylketonuria.\n\n【29】Tyrosine is also the precursor to melanin formation in melanocytes, the first step of which is catalyzed by tyrosinase as shown in Figure 38-3 . This reaction is a 2-step reaction in which DOPA is an intermediate in the formation of dopaquinone. Ring closure of the alanine portion of dopaquinone forms a pyrrole ring and subsequent reactions give rise to the melanins, the primary dark pigment associated with skin color being eumelanin. The absence of tyrosinase gives rise to classic albinism. Phenylalanine is a competitive inhibitor with tyrosine for tyrosinase. Thus in a situation wherein phenylalanine hydroxylase activity is deficient, not only does the α-keto cognate transamination product phenylpyruvate increase but so does the level of phenylalanine. Thus, excess phenylalanine inhibits tyrosinase and melanin formation resulting in hypopigmentation of skin and hair in affected persons.\n删除3：<u>Figure 38-3.

Her feet are also very  删除换行 painful and stiff when she first gets up in the morning. In fact, her symptoms are much worse  删除换行 when she wakes up and the stiffness takes at least an hour to pass. She has also been feeling  删除换行 unwell, tired and slightly feverish and just not her usual energetic self. She is perimenopausal  删除换行 and her periods, although less frequent, have been very heavy so she wonders if the symp删除8：<u>￾</u>toms might be menopausal in origin or whether she might be anaemic. She works as a dog  删除换行 walker and has been very busy recently, so she wonders whether this might also be a factor,  删除换行 and it being winter, has been out in all weathers so has this got anything to do with it? She  删除换行 has been remarkably healthy up until now with no serious illnesses or operations. She is on  删除换行 no medication, apart from the occasional ibuprofen. On further questioning, she has not had  删除换行 any rashes, eye problems, mouth ulcers, dry mouth, dry skin or hair, bowel disturbance or  删除换行 sensitivity to heat or cold. Her weight is stable. She appears bright and denies any depressive  删除换行 symptoms. She does not smoke and drinks about 10 units of alcohol/week. Her father died in  删除换行 a motor vehicle accident in his 40s and her mother, alive at 80 years, has hypothyroidism but  删除换行 is otherwise quite well. She does not know of any psoriasis in the family.\n\n【3】Examination\n\n【4】The patient looks well. The GP examines her hands, palms down with fingers straight, and her  删除换行 wrists. There does not appear to be any marked swelling or deformity, although the patient  删除换行 says that her rings no longer come off because the finger joints are a bit swollen and the hands  删除换行 certainly are tender when the GP palpates them, especially when the metacarpal joints are  删除换行 squeezed. The movements of fingers and wrists are full. The GP looks carefully for a rash and  删除换行 cannot find one; there are no nail changes. The rest of the musculoskeletal examination is  删除换行 normal as is the cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal and neurological examination. Her  删除换行 body mass index (BMI) is 24, as usual.\n\n【5】Investigations\n\n【6】Urinalysis is normal apart from a trace of protein. The GP orders a full blood count (FBC),  删除换行 ferritin levels, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), renal func删除8：<u>￾</u>tion and autoantibodies, including rheumatoid factor. The results come back with a slightly  删除换行 low haemoglobin level of 11.4 g/dL, ferritin level on the lower side of normal, normal red cells  删除换行 and a mildly elevated ESR of 13mm/hour.

Gout usually affects one joint ini删除8：<u>￾</u>tially and there are no symptoms of a viral arthritis, one of the spondarthritides or psoriatic  删除换行 arthropathy.\n\n【11】With only mildly abnormal blood tests, the GP is inclined to prescribe some iron, repeat the  删除换行 blood tests in 6 weeks and see what happens, putting the symptoms down to perimenopausal  删除换行 symptoms. However, she has been to a general practice update on musculoskeletal medicine  删除换行 where it was said that early diagnosis and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is essential to  删除换行 prevent progressive joint destruction and consequent impaired quality of life. This has got  删除换行 the GP worried. The patient certainly has the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis with morn删除8：<u>￾</u>ing stiffness of over 1 hour, joint pain involving more than three joints, hand arthritis and  删除换行 symmetrical arthritis. Also, the patient is not one to complain or come to the GP unless really  删除换行 necessary.

These antibodies can be present in rheumatoid arthritis where rheumatoid  删除换行 factor is absent.\n\n【12】The GP organizes for anti-CCP to be tested and it comes back positive. The GP arranges for  删除换行 an urgent referral to the rheumatologist who confirms a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis  删除换行 and starts the patient on the disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) methotrex删除8：<u>￾</u>ate in association with folic acid. Regular monitoring of FBC, liver function and urea and  删除换行 electrolytes is organized in tandem with the patient’s general practice.

Conditions that may interfere with the olfactory epithelium (transport loss) include allergic， viral， and bacterial rhinitis； nasal polyps or tumors； nasal septal deviation； and nasal surgery. Disorders of the receptors can be produced by medications， infections， tumors， toxic chemical exposures， and a history of radiation exposure. The list of central olfactory disorders is more extensive and includes conditions caused by alcoholism， Alzheimer disease， medications， diabetes， hypothyroidism， Kallmann syndrome， malnutrition， trauma， Parkinson disease， vitamin deficiencies， and Huntington chorea. This patient presents with Kallmann syndrome. Kallmann syndrome (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism) is a disorder of both olfactory axonal and gonadotropin-releas-ing hormone (GnRH) neuronal migration from the olfactory placode in the nose. This is why the patient is sexually infantile and has anosmia.

They are unusual neurons because they are replaced continually throughout life， turning over every 4 to 8 weeks. In addition to the olfactory receptor neurons， the olfactory epithelium contains basal cells (stem cells to replace the receptor neurons) and glial-like support cells. Each olfactory receptor neuron projects a thick den-drite tipped with cilia that end in the mucus layer. The mucus contains odor-ant-binding proteins that concentrate odorants， as well as enzymes and antibodies. The antibodies provide important protection because olfactory receptor neurons present a direct path into the brain that could be used by viruses and bacteria present in aspirated air.**\n\n【23】**Each olfactory receptor neuron produces only one of a large family of about1000 odorant receptor proteins that are localized to the cilia and display a high specificity to particular odorant structures. Different odors stimulate differ-ent combinations of olfactory receptor neurons， and the average human can recognize about 10，000 separate odors (with intensive training that number may go up to about 300，000). Eighty percent of recognizable odors are unpleasant， representing potentially toxic or dangerous substances.**\n\n【24】**Binding of an odorant to an odorant receptor causes excitation by the same sequence of mechanisms in all olfactory receptor neurons. The odorant recep-tors are members of the enormous superfamily of G protein-coupled recep-tors， and binding of a specific odorant to a receptor activates the G protein Golr which in turn activates adenylyl cyclase. The resulting cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) opens cAMP-gated cation channels， permitting the influx of Nat and Ca+ (and the efflux of K+) and depolarizing the cell. The Ca+ (and additional Ca+ that can enter through depolarization-activated Ca\"channels) then activates Ca+-activated Cl- channels. Because olfactory receptor neurons have unusually high intracellular Cl- concentrations， opening these channels causes an efflux of Cl and further depolarization， initiating action potentials. The action potentials are conducted relatively slowly along very thin unmyelinated olfactory receptor neuron axons a short distance**\n\n【25】**into the overlying olfactory bulb by the olfactory nerve (cranial nerve I). Synapses from a very large number of olfactory receptor neuron axons are made onto a much smaller number of relay neurons (mitral cells and tufted cells) and inhibitory interneurons (periglomerular cells) within glomeruli in the olfactory bulb. Information about different odorants is mapped on differ-ent glomeruli. The relay cells project directly to the olfactory cortex， which then projects through the thalamus to the orbitofrontal cortex， where odor per-ception and discrimination occur， and to the amygdala and hypothalamus， where emotional effects are produced.**\n\n【26】**The olfactory epithelium is also innervated by the trigeminal nerve(cranial nerve V)， which contains axons of nociceptive chemoreceptors that have free nerve endings that detect noxious chemicals in the air， such as ammonia and chlorine (as well as components of peppermint and menthol). Activation of these epithelial nociceptors elicits defensive reflexes such as sneezing， lacrimation， and respiratory inhibition. Humans also have a small region of olfactory mucous membrane in the anterior nasal septum that may be homologous to the vomeronasal organ in other mammals. Receptors in this organ transduce olfactory stimuli by mechanisms different from those utilized by other olfactory receptor neurons and project by different pathways to the amygdala and hippocampus. In rodents， and possibly in humans， this acces-sory olfactory system detects pheromones that can influence sexual function.**\n\n【27】**Taste receptor cells are modified epithelial cells that are clustered in taste buds on the tongue and， to a lesser extent， the palate， pharynx， epiglot-tis， and part of the upper esophagus. Each taste bud contains 50 to 100 recep-tor cells as well as basal cells for the generation of new receptor cells (which live only about 10 days). Humans distinguish five tastes： salt， sour， sweet， bitter， and umami， although human perception of taste usually involves con-tributions from olfaction and even texture and temperature. Unlike the olfac-tory and visual systems， which each utilize a single basic transduction mechanism， transduction in taste receptor cells involves diverse mechanisms. In salt taste receptors， transduction occurs when a rise in Nat concentration in the saliva results in sufficient influx of Nat through voltage-insensitive epithelial Na\\* channels (ENaCs)， which are always open， to depolarize the cell. As in most taste cells， this leads to the opening of depolarization-activated Ca²+ channels followed by Ca+-dependent exocytosis of transmitter onto den-drites of primary afferent neurons. Sour taste transduction involves a similar mechanism， with H+ ions permeating ENaCs to depolarize the cell. In addi-tion， H+ions can bind to and block K+channels， which also depolarize the cell. Sweet taste transduction occurs when sugars bind to specific G protein-cou-pled surface receptors that stimulate the synthesis of cAMP， ultimately closing K+ channels.**\n\n【28】**Other G protein-coupled receptors bound by sugars stimulate the 1，4，5-trisphosphate (IP，) pathway， which releases Ca+ from intracellular stores， directly enhancing Ca+-dependent exocytosis of transmitter. Bitter taste transduction involves binding of bitter compounds to receptors linked to a G**\n\n【29】**protein， gustducin， which stimulates phosphodiesterase and decreases cAMP and cyclic guanine monophosphate (cGMP) levels. In these cells cAMP and cGMP lead to hyperpolarization， and so their degradation produces depolar-ization. In addition， other G protein-coupled receptors stimulate the IP， path-way in bitter taste receptors， causing release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and enhanced transmitter release， as in some of the sweet taste receptors. Finally， as in sour taste receptors， some bitter compounds can block K+ chan-nels directly， depolarizing the cell. Umami taste receptors are stimulated by certain amino acids， including L-glutamate， which binds to a metabotropic glu-tamate receptor that activates phosphodiesterase to decrease cAMP and cGMP levels， as in some bitter taste receptor cells.**\n\n【30】**Primary afferent neurons activated by transmitter released from taste recep-tor cells project to the gustatory division of the solitary nucleus in the medulla through the facial (cranial nerve VII)， glossopharyngeal (cranial nerve IX)， and vagus (cranial nerve X) nerves. Information then is relayed through the thala-mus to the primary gustatory cortex in the insular and orbitofronal regions.

The most likely diagnosis is benign rolandic epilepsy (BRE). The most common focal epilepsy of childhood, BRE, has no known etiology, and is localization-related epilepsy. It is highly heritable, although the mode of inheritance remains unclear. BRE typically has its onset between 3 and 13 years of age. Generally, the seizures stop before patients turn 20 years of age, and about two-thirds of patients will have only one or very few seizures. The typical seizure presentation with BRE begins with sensorimotor manifestations on one side of the face and mouth. Unilateral oral paresthesias as well as facial clonic and/or tonic activity are common. Speech arrest, which can be seen regardless of whether the seizure involves the dominant or nondominant hemisphere, and hypersalivation are also frequently reported. Most of the seizure activity is at night, occurring soon after falling asleep or on awakening. The EEG is particularly helpful in making the diagnosis of BRE. Please refer to EEG . Although the patient in this case has returned to baseline, the age of the patient, the presentation, and a family history of similar episodes in his father is highly suggestive of BRE .\n删除3：<u>Figure 49–1 . Crossover of absence seizures with 3-Hz per second spike and wave discharges ( A ) to benign rolandic epilepsy in the same child at age 8 ( B ). Note the numerous spikes over left central and right centroparietal regions in B , typical of benign rolandic epilepsy.</u>\n\n【19】### APPROACH TO: Benign Rolandic Seizures\n\n【20】Regarding an initial classification, seizures are considered generalized if they involve both cerebral hemispheres at onset. Partial seizures , also referred to as focal or as localization-related, begin in one part of one hemisphere. Partial seizures can be further categorized into those that do not impair consciousness—simple partial seizures—and those that do impair consciousness—complex partial seizures. It is not uncommon for partial seizures to spread and involve a greater cortical region as the seizure progresses. If this abnormal activity spreads to the contralateral hemisphere then the seizure is said to be secondarily generalized. This would appear to be what happened in the case under consideration because the child initially had focal manifestations (speech arrest and right hemifacial clonus) followed by generalized motor activity (a generalized tonic–clonic seizure).\n\n【21】A partial seizure is by definition a manifestation of a focal physiologic abnormality in the cortex. Oftentimes this will be associated with an anatomic abnormality seen with an MRI scan. Examples of common causes of such a lesion would be trauma, stroke, infection, tumor, or a congenital malformation of cortical development. If an anatomical substrate is seen in association with the region of seizure onset (the seizure focus), then the disorder is classified as _symptomatic_ . Alternatively, a seizure focus can exist without any obvious finding on neuroimaging. In this case, the disorder would be considered _cryptogenic_ (indicating that the cause _remains hidden_ ). The third category of epilepsies is _idiopathic_ , which refers to conditions in which there is a known or presumed genetic etiology. The most common focal epilepsy of childhood, BRE, is an example of idiopathic localization-related epilepsy, which is highly heritable, although the mode of that inheritance remains unclear.\n\n【22】The behavioral manifestations, or _semiology_ , of focal seizures reflect the normal function of the region of the brain from which they arise. For example, an occipital lobe focus can produce visual manifestations whereas a focus in the primary motor cortex can generate contralateral tonic and/or clonic activity. In this patient, his speech arrest and right hemifacial clonus suggests a seizure focus near the facial aspect of the left motor strip as well as the nearby regions responsible for expressive language. This would be consistent with a _perirolandic_ location involving the lateral aspect of the left hemisphere near the central sulcus (formerly referred to as the _rolandic fissure_ ). Information about seizure presentation is combined with the findings of MRI and electroencephalography in an attempt to localize the focal abnormality.\n\n【23】BRE, also referred to as _benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes_ , is an age-dependent epilepsy syndrome with an onset of between 3 and 13 years. Essentially all patients will cease having their habitual seizures by 20 years of age, which is one reason that the condition is labeled _benign_ . Another reason for this is that approximately two-thirds of patients will have only one or very few seizures, which is important when considering whether or not to begin anticonvulsant therapy. The typical seizure of BRE begins with sensorimotor manifestations on one side of the face and mouth. Unilateral oral paresthesias as well as facial clonic and/or tonic activity are common. Speech arrest, which can be seen regardless of whether the seizure involves the dominant or nondominant hemisphere, and hypersalivation are also frequently reported. Some variability in seizure symptomatology between seizures can be seen for any given patient with some having two distinct seizure types. Approximately 75% of seizures are nocturnal, occurring soon after falling asleep or on awakening. The remainder of patients has nocturnal and daytime seizures or, more rarely, only events during waking hours.\n\n【24】Obtaining an EEG is particularly helpful in making the diagnosis of BRE because several characteristic features can be seen interictally. If a period of sleep is captured during the recording session, then approximately 30% of patients with BRE will have sharp waves seen arising from the centrotemporal region. Although beyond the scope of this review, there are other features, such as a _frontal dipole_ and a _prepotential_ , which aid in identifying these sharp waves as consistent with BRE. If both the history and the EEG are consistent with BRE, no further diagnostic workup needs to be undertaken. If the history is consistent, but the EEG is unrevealing then it can be worth obtaining another EEG to see if diagnostic abnormal activity can be captured. Certainly if there are focal features on neurologic examination, concerning aspects to the history (such as developmental regression), or abnormalities on EEG that are inconsistent with BRE, then neuroimaging with an MRI should be strongly considered. Interestingly, not all patients with EEG abnormalities consistent with BRE actually have seizures. In fact, only 10% of patients with centrotemporal sharp waves of the BRE type ever experience one or more clinical seizures.\n\n【25】Once the diagnosis is made, consideration must turn to treatment. Most patients experience only one or very few seizures, and all patients eventually outgrow BRE. Also, although this is a matter of some debate, there is no evidence that the typical and infrequent seizures of BRE are harmful to the developing nervous system. Given these factors, as well as the side effects of anticonvulsants, many neurologists recommend withholding treatment until a patient has experienced three or more seizures. Clearly this is a decision that must be tailored to the individual patient in careful consultation with the child and the child’s parents. If treatment is initiated, then most of the anticonvulsants have shown some efficacy in BRE and usually at relatively low dosages. The diagnosis of BRE must be reconsidered in patients who do not respond to treatment, whose seizures persist into adulthood, or in those patients who have very frequent or otherwise atypical seizures.\n\n【26】####", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Severe oedema 删除换行 of venous origin is invariably related to the deep vein disease.\n\n【2】The clinical outcome of the deep vein disease varies with  删除换行 the segment of the venous tree involved. Grossly swollen  删除换行 limb is usually associated with upper segment or  删除换行 iliofemoral vein pathology. The initial lesion is thrombus  删除换行 formation. Acute obstruction produced by rapidly  删除换行 developing thrombosis, particularly in the iliofemoral  删除换行 segment, will produce severe swelling. As the venous  删除换行 collateral circulation develops this swelling gradually  删除换行 subsides. Recanalisation of the thrombosed segment later  删除换行 on takes place and during this time the limb remains  删除换行 comfortable. When the latter process is complete, the  删除换行 previously thrombosed segment will regain patency but  删除换行 the valves are permanently destroyed. This leads to venous  删除换行 hypertension and oedema formation.\n\n【3】Deep vein thrombosis affecting lower segment or calf  删除换行 veins may not produce a big swelling. The principal lesion  删除换行 here is the incompetence of valves in the perforating  删除换行 veins. Minor oedema occur in these cases in the lower  删除换行 third of the leg and foot. But of greater significance are  删除换行 the changes produced in the local tissues exposed to the \n\n【4】'high pressure leak' due to the calf muscle pump. Skin  删除换行 atrophy and subcutaneous fibrosis may develop which will  删除换行 gradually lead to chronic ulceration and this is the most  删除换行 constant feature of postphlebitic syndrome. The medial  删除换行 group of perforating veins are usually constant and it is  删除换行 the skin above the medial malleolus that suffers most in  删除换行 perforating vein disease.\n\n【5】Clinical features.—\n\n【6】Severe oedema of venous origin is invariably related  删除换行 to deep vein disease. The history and clinical picture  删除换行 vary according to the segment of the venous tree involved.\n\n【7】Iliofemoral thrombosis.— This starts with an acute  删除换行 onset with rapid development of painful swelling from  删除换行 groin to foot. This condition is classically seen (i) in 删除换行 puerperium (phlegmasia alba dolens), (ii) in the  删除换行 postoperative patient, (iii) in bedfast medical patient, (iv) \n\n【8】in patients with contraceptive pills or (iv) with latent  删除换行 carcinoma.\n\n【9】If the entire iliofemoral segment is involved, the limb  删除换行 is quickly swollen and cyanotic. There may be fever and  删除换行 tachycardia. Localised tenderness may be present in the  删除换行 groin over the femoral vein.\n\n【10】'Phlegmasia cerulea dolens' is the most severe form of  删除换行 iliofemoral thrombosis and is the result of almost total  删除换行 outflow obstruction. Gross swelling develops rapidly and  删除换行 the limbs become dusky cyanotic in colour with patches  删除换行 of cutaneous gangrene. Arterial pulses are impalpable due  删除换行 to oedema.\n\n【11】With lesser degrees of iliofemoral thrombosis a  删除换行 satisfactory venous collateral circulation gradually develops  删除换行 and the swelling comes down within a few weeks,  删除换行 although the limb may become uncomfortable with  删除换行 exercise.\n\n【12】Recanalisation of the occluded segment may become  删除换行 complete after a considerable interval and by then the  删除换行 valvular competence is permanently destroyed. At this stage  删除换行 swelling again worsens and the symptoms of venous  删除换行 hypertension become evident.\n\n【13】Iliac vein compression.— Oedema may be produced  删除换行 by anatomical compression of the left common iliac vein  删除换行 by the right common iliac artery. Some authors have  删除换行 also described bands and webs within the lumen of the  删除换行 left common iliac vein. Phlebography will diagnose either  删除换行 compression or intraluminal abnormalities.\n\n【14】Lower segment thrombosis.— Deep vein thrombosis in  删除换行 the calf veins is a very common complication of the  删除换行 postoperative period. But in this condition swellng is  删除换行 usually minimal. Pulmonary embolisation may result in  删除换行 this thrombosis. But destruction of the valves in the  删除换行 perforating veins is the main feature of postphlebitic  删除换行 syndrome which may develop at a considerable time  删除换行 interval from the initial thrombotic incident. Due to  删除换行 incompetent perforating veins in the lower third of the  删除换行 leg, the subcutaneous tissue and skin in this area become  删除换行 exposed to 'high pressure leak' from the calf muscle pump. \n\n【15】The result is venous ulceration which is the real problem  删除换行 and not the swelling.\n\n【16】Special Investigations.—\n\n【17】Before radiology of the venous system is taken, the  删除换行 patient must be put to bed with high elevation of the  删除换行 limb. A diuretic such as frusemide, should be given. In  删除换行 this way the degree of swelling is reduced considerably  删除换行 within a few days. If the aetiology of the swelling cannot  删除换行 be found out, it is better to do the phlebograhy first,  删除换行 followed by lymphangiography.SWOLLEN LEG 189\n\n【18】Phlebography.— Injection of radio-opaque dye into an  删除换行 ankle vein with the subcutaneous tourniquet in the lower  删除换行 third of the leg will satisfactorily outline the deep veins  删除换行 in the calf, popliteal vein and the femoral vein as far as  删除换行 the inguinal ligament. The iliac veins, however, are not  删除换行 satisfactorily visualised by this technique and it is better  删除换行 to perform either direct puncture of the femoral vein in  删除换行 the groin or to use an intra-osseous route via the iliac  删除换行 crest or the greater trochanter. If iliac vein thrombosis  删除换行 exists, cross-over collateral channels can be seen running  删除换行 across the pelvis, whereas the common iliac segment of  删除换行 the affected side will not fill. In lower segment disease  删除换行 with incompetent perforating veins it is often possible to  删除换行 see refilling of the superficial vein proximal to the  删除换行 obstructing tourniquet via the incompetent perforators.\n\n【19】SELF INFLICTED ULCERS.—\n\n【20】Management of the venous oedema differs according  删除换行 to the segment involved.\n\n【21】Iliofemoral thrombosis.— This condition more often  删除换行 presents acutely with rapidly developing swelling of the  删除换行 entire limb.\n\n【22】If the patient is seen within a few days of onset,  删除换行 the treatment is operation of thrombectomy. Successful  删除换行 thrombectomy not only relieves oedema but will restore  删除换行 longterm patency and avoid chronic swelling and  删除换行 discomfort. The success of thrombectomy depends on the  删除换行 duration of the thrombotic process at the time of  删除换行 operation. Thrombectomy within 48 hours of onset gives  删除换行 the best result. With each succeeding 24 hours period,  删除换行 the prospects of success diminish considerably. When the  删除换行 diagnosis is easy with considerable swollen leg and  删除换行 tenderness over the femoral vein in the groin or even  删除换行 tenderness over the iliac veins in the lower abdomen,  删除换行 investigation is unnecessary and operation should be  删除换行 straightaway carried out. With less dramatic clinical  删除换行 picture, phlebography is a useful investigation and will  删除换行 reveal the site and extent of the thrombotic process.\n\n【23】Technique of operation.—It is important to have 2  删除换行 litres of blood ready for transfusion in hand before the  删除换行 operation is started. General anaesthesia is preferred. The  删除换行 common femoral vein and its tributaries are exposed in  删除换行 the groin. A longitudinal venotomy is performed. The  删除换行 thrombus is extracted with the aid of suction catheters  删除换行 and the Fogarty balloon catheter. Complete extraction of  删除换行 clot from the distal leg can be helped by distal to  删除换行 proximal bandaging with Esmarch bandage. Proximal  删除换行 thrombosis is removed by the balloon catheter. If there is  删除换行 doubt as to complete removal of proximal thrombus, a  删除换行 venogram may be performed on the operation table. \n\n【24】When no further clot remains and free flow is obtained  删除换行 from the proximal to distal segments, the venotomy 删除换行 incision is closed. Concomitant plication of the inferior  删除换行 venacava may be necessary if dislodgement of thrombosis  删除换行 with pulmonary embolisation is feared.\n\n【25】A small polythene catheter is guided through a  删除换行 tributary of the long saphenous vein into the common  删除换行 femoral vein. This catheter is utilised to maintain a  删除换行 continuous drip of heparinised saline which should be  删除换行 maintained for the first postoperative week. Phlebography  删除换行 or venogram is performed through this catheter on 1, 2  删除换行 and 4 days postoperatively. If a residual thrombus is  删除换行 revealed, a fibrinolytic agent such as urokinase should be  删除换行 used through the catheter with the repeated venographic  删除换行 control.\n\n【26】The limb should be kept elevated in the postoperative  删除换行 period. In those patients who present late for  删除换行 thrombectomy, a long term anticoagulation should be  删除换行 carried out. Once the initial oedema has subsided the  删除换行 patient may become ambulant Wearing a firm supportive  删除换行 bandage.\n\n【27】Chronic iliofemoral venous obstruction.— Treatment  删除换行 of choice is conservative management with external support  删除换行 to the limb in the form of elastic bandage or elastic  删除换行 stockings. The patient should sleep with the footend of  删除换行 the bed elevated. Diuretics may be prescribed to reduce  删除换行 the swelling.\n\n【28】Only surgery which can help the patient is a cross删除8：<u>￾</u>over operation using the opposite long saphenous vein.\n\n【29】Lower segment disease.— The main problem is  删除换行 venous ulceration and the treatment of this condition  删除换行 has been described under the. heading of 'venous ulcer' \n\n【30】in the chapter of 'Varicose Veins'.\n\n【31】DIABETIC ULCER.—\nPathology On an aetiological basis, lymphoedema  删除换行 may be divided into 2 groups :\n\n【32】(a) Primary lymphoedema in which there is a  删除换行 developmental error of the regional lymphatic system.\n\n【33】(b) Secondary lymphoedema in which there is  删除换行 acquired pathology of the defective local lymphatic system.\n\n【34】PRIMARY LYMPHOEDEMA.—This can be divided  删除换行 into three clinical subgroups according to the age of onset  删除换行 of the swelling.\n\n【35】(i) In lymphoedema congenita, the oedema is  删除换行 present in birth. This was first described by Milroy in  删除换行 1892. This variety is comparatively rare and occurs in  删除换行 about 10% of all cases of primary lymphoedema.\n\n【36】(ii) Lymphoedema praecox starts in adolescents and  删除换行 this constitutes 75% of patients with primary  删除换行 lymphoedema.\n\n【37】(iii) Lymphoedema tarda constitutes 15% of patients190 A TEXTBOOK ON SURGICAL SHORT CASES 删除换行 with primary lymphoedema and in these cases the swelling  删除换行 is delayed until after the age of 35 years.\n\n【38】In primary lymphoedema there is some developmental  删除换行 fault in the lymphatic system and a family history is found  删除换行 in about 1/5th cases. In about 1/2 the patients the  删除换行 malformation is predominantly unilateral.\n\n【39】Lymphangiography has demonstrated 3 basic types of  删除换行 malformation in this disease —\n\n【40】(a) Aplasia of the subcutaneous lymph trunks in  删除换行 the limbs is found in 13% of patients. Formed lymphatic  删除换行 vessels are absent, but there are haphazardly arranged  删除换行 lymph spaces with no attempt to form lymphatic channels. \n\n【41】This is a severe malformation and is often associated with  删除换行 the congenital variety.\n\n【42】(b) In 75% of cases the subcutaneous lymphatic  删除换行 trunks in the leg are hypoplastic. They may be too small  删除换行 in size and number. The commonest defect in this group  删除换行 is presence of a solitary lymph vessel, which ascends the  删除换行 limb without normal bifurcation and branching. This  删除换行 may be termed solitary hypoplasia, which may extend  删除换行 upto the knee or even upto the groin. In a small number  删除换行 of patients hypoplasia may affect the lymph nodes in the  删除换行 groin while the lymph trunks remain normal.\n\n【43】(c) The third malformation is the varicose or 删除换行 dilated lymph trunks seen in 12% of patients with primary  删除换行 lymphoedema. In this condition the subcutaneous tissues  删除换行 are filled with dilated and tortuous lymphatics which are  删除换行 incompetent and allow retrograde reflux of lymph. This  删除换行 is often associated with diffuse arteriovenous fistulae. The  删除换行 varicose state may extend proximally to involve the pelvic  删除换行 and even para-aortic lymph trunks. This allows retrograde  删除换行 flow of intestinal chyle into the groin and thigh. Chyle删除8：<u>￾</u>filled vesicles may appear in the skin of the leg and  删除换行 troublesome leak of milky lymph may develop.\n\n【44】The prognosis of primary lymphoedema depends on  删除换行 the type and extent of the malformation. While lymphatic  删除换行 function is severely prejudiced in aplasia and the varicose  删除换行 types, hypoplastic variety is less troublesome.\n\n【45】SECONDARY LYMPHOEDEMA.— This condition  删除换行 may follow involvement of the lymph channels or lymph  删除换行 nodes by neoplastic or inflammatory process, by surgical  删除换行 excision or by radiotherapy. In some areas parasitic  删除换行 infestation with filariasis is destructive within the lymph  删除换行 nodes and' may produce secondary lymphoedema. In the  删除换行 majority of cases of secondary lymphoedema the disease  删除换行 process is a local affair in contrast to the primary  删除换行 lymphoedema where the malformation is widespread over  删除换行 an entire limb.\n\n【46】Clinical features.—\n\n【47】Primary lymphoedema is mostly seen in adolescent  删除换行 girls. The swelling begins insidiously with no apparent 删除换行 cause. The patient first notices a little puffiness around  删除换行 the ankle which disappears after a night's rest only to  删除换行 return at a late stage of the next day. Gradually the  删除换行 oedema progresses slowly. Severe swelling is unusual until  删除换行 several years have elapsed. The most important feature is  删除换行 that the swelling is painless (in contrast to venous disease). \n\n【48】The main complaint of the patient is cosmetic appearance.\n\n【49】Secondary lymphoedema develops much more rapidly. \n\n【50】Usually there is clear indication of the local pathology \n\n【51】(as mentioned earlier in the classification). This swelling  删除换行 is usually accompanied by discomfort in the swollen  删除换行 tissues. Recurrent cellulitis is not uncommon. The  删除换行 infection is usually streptococcal. High pyrexia and rigors  删除换行 are usually accompanied with.\n\n【52】Clinically, it may not be so easy to differentiate  删除换行 venous from lymphatic oedema. But skin changes,  删除换行 pigmentation, atrophy and tendency to ulceration favour  删除换行 the diagnosis of post-phlebitic swelling of venous origin. \n\n【53】In a lymphoedema the skin remains usually healthy except  删除换行 slight thickening, hyperkeratosis and recurrent cellulitis. \n\n【54】Pain is an important symptom of swelling of venous  删除换行 aetiology, which is rarely seen in lymphoedema.\n\n【55】Special Investigations.—\n\n【56】Lymphangiography.— In this technique the lymphatics  删除换行 of the lower limb are delineated with radio-opaque dye.\n\n【57】Surgically, a lymphatic trunk of the dorsum of the  删除换行 foot is exposed. Iodised oil contrast medium (neohydriol  删除换行 ultrafluid lipiodol) should be injected directly into the  删除换行 exposed lymphatic trunk on the dorsum of the foot. By  删除换行 this contrast medium the lymph nodes as well as lymph  删除换行 trunks can be well visualised radiographically. The contrast  删除换行 medium is warmed and injected into the exposed lymph  删除换行 trunk. For a lower limb, approximately 6 ml of solution  删除换行 is injected over a period of 1 hour. Too rapid injection  删除换行 may produce respiratory distress and pulmonary oil  删除换行 embolus.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

During the intraoperative period she developed hypotension that was unresponsive to fluid resuscitation and required initiation of dopamine to maintain arterial systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 80 mmHg. The need for inotropic support and concern for continuing hypotension was the rationale for PICU admission.History of Present Illness\n--------------------------\n\n【4】This is a previously healthy 12‐year‐old female who began complaining of abdominal pain and fevers 4 days prior to admission. At that time she was seen by her primary care provider and referred to the local emergency department (ED). Abdominal ultrasound was negative at that time and she was discharged home with a diagnosis of viral gastroenteritis. She presented to the ED last evening with worsening pain at McBurney’s point and positive Rovsing’s sign. Because of concerns for appendicitis she was admitted to surgical team and taken to the operating room for a laparoscopic appendectomy and had an easy mask induction with oxygen and sevoflurane. She was given rocuronium, fentanyl, and ondansetron and was intubated with a 7.0 cuffed endotracheal tube. End‐tidal carbon dioxide (CO <sub>2 </sub> ) recording was obtained and maintained throughout the procedure and bilateral breath sounds were auscultated. Once asleep she had two peripheral intravenous catheters placed in her left and right hand as well as a left radial 20‐gauge arterial line placed. Anesthesia was maintained throughout the case with sevoflurane, and with intermittent doses of fentanyl and rocuronium. Antibiotics that were started on admission in the ED were continued during the case. The appendix ruptured during the surgery and an open appendectomy with washout was completed. She required two fluid boluses of 20 mL/kg for a total of 1800 mL of normal saline due to hypotension. An infusion of dopamine was initiated for continued SBP of 68–78 mmHg. Dopamine was titrated to 10 μg/kg per min to maintain SBP above 80 mmHg and mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg. All other vital signs remained within accepted parameters. Despite hypotension, the remainder of the procedure went well. At the conclusion of the case, the patient was given glycopyrrolate and neostigmine, anesthesia was reversed, and the child was extubated without difficulty. The patient received a total of 1800 mL of crystalloid fluid, and there was urine output of 160 mL, with overall minimal blood loss with the surgical procedure. Because of the need for inotropic support and continued hypotension, the patient was transferred to the PICU for continued care.Past Medical History/Past Surgical History\n------------------------------------------\n\n【5】This patient was born at term by spontaneous vaginal delivery and was discharged home with her mother.

What is the best way to maximize blood pressure and what is the goal MAP?\n\n【18】Continuation of case : After discussion with the surgical team, the patient received another 20 mL/kg fluid bolus on arrival at the PICU for continued hypotension and was started on an epinephrine infusion at 0.03 μg/kg per min, titrated up to a goal of maintaining MAP above 70–75 mmHg. The patient’s oxygen and respiratory effort remained stable and she is continuously monitored.\n\n【19】The PICU elected to obtain mixed venous oxygen saturation level via the subclavian line with a repeat CBC, lactate level, and BMP, with results showing _S_ v O <sub>2 </sub> 72%, CBC and BMP stable, and lactate 1.4 mmol/L. The surgical team was reluctant to initiate norepinephrine due to concerns for perfusion to the surgical site, so epinephrine was titrated to 0.09 μg/kg per min with SBP maintained at 88–90 mmHg. _S_ v O <sub>2 </sub> remained at 70–75% and urine output was 0.8–1.1 mL/kg per hour.\n\n【20】1.  What evidence guides the decision to use epinephrine or norepinephrine?\n2.  Would you obtain any other diagnostic studies?Rationale and Evidence‐based Practice Explanation\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】### Based on the data given, what are the differential diagnoses for this child?\n\n【22】Differential diagnoses for this child include persistent shock due to significant fluid loss, fluid shifts or ascites, cardiac dysfunction, cardiac tamponade or tension pneumothorax, or catecholamine resistance. Given this child’s physical examination, cardiac dysfunction can be excluded. According to the “early goal‐directed therapy for treatment of shock” protocol, the patient has received appropriate treatment with fluid boluses and initiation of inotropic support. However, given the other measures of perfusion are reassuring, evaluation for adrenal insufficiency should be considered at this point. Adrenal insufficiency in this patient is most likely due to a proinflammatory response related to septic shock which has caused decreased cortisol production and synthesis. This dysfunction of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis can occur during a critical illness and results in an inadequate response to stress.\n\n【23】### What additional diagnostic studies and/or consults should be obtained?\n\n【24】Prior to treating for adrenal insufficiency, assessment of adrenocortical function should be completed. Obtaining a morning cortisol level (at 8 a.m.) would be ideal; however, in situations such as seen with surgery there may be an alteration in cortisol levels due to the stress of the procedure alone. An adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test also evaluates adrenal gland function and is more reasonable in this circumstance. Measurements of serum cortisol levels are obtained at baseline and then 60 minutes after an infusion of synthetic ACTH. Recommended dosing is 250 μg for children over 2 years of age, given over 1 minute. Serum cortisol levels are then evaluated in comparison to baseline levels, with a normal response being a minimum of >18 μg/dL and at least 7–10 μg/dL greater than the baseline.\n\n【25】Treatment of catecholamine‐resistant shock requires stress dose hydrocortisone 50–100 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> (maximum 100 mg/dose) followed by 50 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> per 24 hours (maximum 100 mg/dose) divided every 4–6 hours until the patient is hemodynamically stable and able to be weaned from vasoactive medications.\n\n【26】### What is the best way to maximize blood pressure and what is the goal MAP?\n\n【27】In addition to capillary refill of 2 seconds or less and normalization of blood pressure, goals for this patient include urine output above 1 mL/kg per hour, normal mental status, normalization of serum lactate (beyond the operative period), maintaining normal perfusion pressure (MAP – CVP for age), and _S_ v O <sub>2 </sub> greater than 70%. Administration of hydrocortisone will improve the hypotension and the vasoactive infusions can be weaned in order of initiation, with epinephrine discontinued first. Goals should continue to be normalization of perfusion, cardiac output as well as oxygenation and ventilation.\n\n【28】### What evidence guides the decision to use epinephrine or norepinephrine?\n\n【29】Epinephrine is used in the presence of cold shock, which in this case was determined by hypotension as the primary symptom with the knowledge that a ruptured appendix can contribute to peritonitis, or an abdominal infection, causing sepsis. Norepinephrine is primarily used for management of “warm shock,” during which time blood pressure may be normal or low in children.\n\n【30】### Would you obtain any other diagnostic studies?\n\n【31】Given the fact that this patient developed adrenal insufficiency after a ruptured appendix versus longer‐term critical illness and is at risk for further hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal dysfunction, an endocrinology consult would be helpful for evaluation. Continued monitoring of electrolytes while the patient is NPO and frequent intake and output are part of PICU care. Avoidance of hypocalcemia as well as hypoglycemia/hyperglycemia is important for preventing secondary complications of critical illness. The patient progressed to spend another day in the PICU for weaning of inotropic support, was stabilized, and was transferred to the pediatric general unit on day 3 of hospitalization.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Atelectasis is suspected because of shifting of the mediastinum toward the left suggesting volume loss. There is complete obliteration of the lateral hemithorax and the left lung base. The right lung is clear. Gas‐distended bowel loops are noted in the left upper abdomen.\n\n【9】### What are the most common pathogens causing pneumonia in infants and children?\n\n【10】See Table 1.3 .\n\n【11】### What are the recommended antimicrobial therapies for bacterial pneumonia?\n\n【12】Treatment of suspected bacterial pneumonia is based on presumed pathogen, age, and clinical appearance of the patient. For a mildly ill child who does not require hospitalization, amoxicillin is recommended. For school‐age children or clinical features concerning for atypical pneumonia ( _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_ or _Chlamydophila pneumoniae_ ), azithromycin is recommended. For those who require hospitalization, the antibiotic of choice is cefotaxime or ceftriaxone. If clinical features suggest _Staphylococcus aureus_ (pneumatoceles, empyema or bronchopulmonary fistula) initial antibiotic therapy should include clindamycin or vancomycin.\n\n【13】If viral pneumonia is suspected, it is reasonable to withhold antibiotic therapy especially in patients who are clinically stable and present with clinical evidence suggesting a viral infection. Optimal total duration of antibiotic therapy should not be less than 10–14 days, unless azithromycin is used (duration of 5 days total).\n\n【14】Continuation of case : The child is admitted to the PICU and continues to have oxygen desaturations despite an increase to 70% oxygen using HFNC at 12 L/min. She becomes lethargic with increased work of breathing. The patient is intubated and a chest tube is placed in the left pleural space. About 400 mL of frank pus is drained from the chest tube.\n\n【15】1.  What are the most common causes of pleural effusion?\n2.  What are the characteristics of an exudative effusion?\n3.  What is the management of pleural empyema?\n\n【16】### What are the most common causes of pleural effusion?\n\n【17】See Table 1.4 .\n\n【18】### What are the characteristics of an exudative effusion (empyema)?\n\n【19】See Table 1.5 .\n\n【20】Table 1.3 Pathogens causing pneumonia in infants and children.\n\n| Cause | Age and epidemiology | Common complications |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Bacterial | Bacterial | Bacterial |\n| Group B streptococci | Neonates | Shock, respiratory failure, apnea |\n| _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ | 3 weeks to 4 years, asplenia, immunosuppressed | Consolidation, pneumatoceles, empyema, shock |\n| _Staphylococcus aureus_ | Infants | Pneumatoceles, empyema |\n| _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_ | \\>5 years; summer to fall | Atypical pneumonia |\n| Group A streptococci | \\>5 years | Empyema, pneumatoceles |\n| _Chlamydophila pneumoniae_ | Adolescents | Atypical pneumonia |\n| _Chlamydia trachomatis_ | Neonates | Associated with conjunctivitis |\n| Mixed anaerobes | Underlying pulmonary disease | Aspiration and necrotizing pneumonia, pneumatoceles |\n| Gram‐negative enterics ( _Pseudomonas_ ) | Neonates | Hospital‐acquired pneumonia, necrotizing pneumonia, shock |\n|  |  |  |\n| Viral: infants and children <5 years | Viral: infants and children <5 years | Viral: infants and children <5 years |\n| Respiratory syncytial virus | Winter | Bronchiolitis, apnea |\n| Parainfluenza types 1–3 | Fall | Croup, wheezing, pneumonitis, tracheitis |\n| Influenza A, B | Winter | High fever, bacterial superinfection, apnea, seizures, Guillain–Barré syndrome, Reye syndrome |\n| Human metapneumovirus | Winter | Similar to respiratory syncytial virus |\n|  |  |  |\n| Others | Others | Others |\n| Foreign body, food or gastric acid aspiration, hypersensitivity to inhaled material (hydrocarbon or lipoid substances), drug‐ or radiation‐induced pneumonitis | Foreign body, food or gastric acid aspiration, hypersensitivity to inhaled material (hydrocarbon or lipoid substances), drug‐ or radiation‐induced pneumonitis | Foreign body, food or gastric acid aspiration, hypersensitivity to inhaled material (hydrocarbon or lipoid substances), drug‐ or radiation‐induced pneumonitis |\n\n【22】Table 1.4 Causes of pleural effusion.\n\n| Category | Causes |\n| --- | --- |\n| Infection (exudates) | Bacterial, viral, fungal, mycobacterial |\n| Cardiovascular | Congestive heart failure, constrictive pericarditis, superior vena cava obstruction, postcardiac surgery |\n| Pulmonary | Pulmonary infarction, atelectasis, pulmonary embolism, drug‐induced pleuritic reaction |\n| Intra‐abdominal | Abdominal surgery, pancreatitis, hepatitis, peritonitis, subdiaphragmatic or intrahepatic abscess, cirrhosis with ascites |\n| Renal | Uremia, urinary tract obstruction, nephrotic syndrome, peritoneal dialysis |\n| Neoplastic | Lymphoma, leukemia, carcinoma |\n| Collagen vascular disease | Rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren syndrome, Wegener granulomatosis, myxedema, sarcoidosis |\n| Iatrogenic/miscellaneous | Extravascular central venous catheter placement (i.e. misplaced catheter), radiation therapy, hemothorax, chylothorax, hypoalbuminemia, esophageal rupture |\n\n【24】### What is the management of empyema?\n\n【25】Treatment of empyema is based on stage of disease (exudative, fibrinopurulent, and organizing) which can be assessed using imaging studies such as ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT). In stage 1 (exudative), fibrinous exudates, which are clear and sterile, form on the surface of the pleura. In stage 2 (fibrinopurulent), the exudates become thick and purulent. Septations are formed creating infected pleura that are loculated. In stage 3 (organizing), granulation tissues are created from proliferation of the fibroblast‐creating areas of abscess cavities surrounding the lung. Treatment involves antibiotic therapy and drainage with tube thoracostomy. In order to debride or lyse adhesions and drain loculated areas of pus, additional approaches could be utilized including intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy (streptokinase, urokinase, or tissue plasminogen activator) and surgical options (selected video‐assisted thoracoscopy and decortication).\n\n【26】Table 1.5 Characteristics of an exudative effusion (empyema).\n\n| Characteristic | Transudate | Empyema |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Appearance | Clear | Cloudy |\n| Cell count (per mm 3 ) | <1000 | Usually >50 000 |\n| Cell type | Lymphocytes, monocytes | Neutrophils |\n| Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) | <200 U/L | \\>1000 U/L |\n| Pleural fluid LDH/serum LDH | <0.6 | \\>0.6 |\n| Protein <3 g | Rare | Frequent |\n| Pleural fluid protein/serum protein | <0.5 | \\>0.5 |\n| Glucose | Normal (>60 mg/dL) | Low (<40 mg/dL) |\n| pH | Normal (7.40–7.60) | <7.30 |\n| Gram stain | Negative | Sometimes positive |&&&&\n1  \nComplication of Pneumonia\n=============================\n\n【28】_Ji‐Yeon Kim_\n\n【29】_Children’s Hospital of Michigan, Detroit, MI, USA_\n\n【30】A 2‐year‐old previously healthy female is admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with tachypnea, grunting, and nasal flaring. She is hypoxic despite receiving supplemental oxygen with a high‐flow nasal cannula (HFNC) at 12 L/min and _F_ iO <sub>2 </sub> 0.7.History of Present Illness\n--------------------------\n\n【31】This is a 2‐year‐old female with no significant past medical history who presented with 2 days of fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. Her mother reports that for the past 2 weeks the patient has had intermittent low‐grade fever with cough. Difficulty breathing started 2 days ago with fever of 40°C (104°F). She has been eating and drinking less and having decreased wet diapers. She has been in close contact with her older brother who has also had symptoms of cough, rhinorrhea, and congestion. Her parents decided to bring her to the emergency department (ED) when her fever did not defervesce with acetaminophen and she continued to have difficulty breathing.Past Medical History\n--------------------\n\n【32】The patient was born at 39 weeks gestational age.

As mentioned earlier a pulsatile swelling or an  删除换行 aneurysmal dilatation is particularly visible if the lesion  删除换行 is superficial.\n\n【2】2. One can find the dilated collateral circulation  删除换行 with increased temperature of the skin.\n\n【3】3. Port-wine discolouration of the skin may also be  删除换行 seen due to increased collateral circulation.\n\n【4】4. Distended superficial veins may also be visible. \n\n【5】The veins are often varicosed.\n\n【6】5. Increased length of the limb is often noticed in  删除换行 congenital fistula. This may be noticed in acquired type if  删除换行 the fistula has developed before completion of bonyANEURYSM 143 删除换行 growth, but this will be less evident.\n\n【7】6. On palpation a thrill may be detected. Pressure  删除换行 on the artery proximal to the fistula causes the swelling  删除换行 to diminish in size. The thrill and the bruit cease to exist.\n\n【8】7. Below the fistula the limb is ill-developed, it  删除换行 feels cooler.\n\n【9】8. Below the fistula muscle wasting may be  删除换行 noticed.\n\n【10】9. Below the fistula one may find ischaemic changes  删除换行 of the extremity with presence of even indolent leg ulcer.\n\n【11】This is due to inadequate arterial blood supply below  删除换行 the fistula due to diversion of blood into the veins.\n\n【12】10. Auscultation reveals continuous bruit.\n\n【13】PRESSURE EFFECTS.—\n\n【14】The signs are similar that have been described above  删除换行 under the heading of ‘systemic effects'. Here one sign de删除8：<u>￾</u>serves mentioning i.e. Branham’s sign. If a finger is pressed  删除换行 on the artery proximal to the fistula, there will be slow删除8：<u>￾</u>ing of pulse rate and rise in the diastolic pressure.\n\n【15】Special Investigations.—\n\n【16】1. Arteriography confirms the diagnosis. This also  删除换行 indicates the position of the fistula and its size.\n\n【17】2. Ultrasound.— The lesion and the enlarged veins can  删除换行 be aptly demonostrated by ultrasonography.\n\n【18】Treatment.—\n\n【19】CONGENITAL LESIONS are not progressive, so  删除换行 excision is only advised for severe deformity and recurrent  删除换行 haemorrhage. Some of these lesions are too extensive for  删除换行 appropriate surgical excision, so palliative surgical  删除换行 procedures are used to control disabling ulceration and  删除换行 infection or life-threatening haemorrhage. Alternative  删除换行 techniques of non-surgical closure include selective intra删除8：<u>￾</u>arterial embolisation of autologous clot, wire, coil, plastic  删除换行 materials or transcatheter coagulation. Each of these  删除换行 techniques is successful in closing even large fistulas,  删除换行 which would have been difficult or even impossible to  删除换行 manage surgically. Other type of therapy is injection of  删除换行 sclerosing solutions.\n\n【20】The ACQUIRED LESIONS are usually progressive and  删除换行 operations are always required.\n\n【21】1. Reconstructive operation is the operation of choice. \n\n【22】The vessels are separated. The intervening sac is excised. \n\n【23】The defects in the vessels walls are repaired. In difficult  删除换行 cases it may be necessary to reconstruct the artery at the  删除换行 expense of the vein. Such reconstruction is performed with  删除换行 the involved vein (which has been sacrificed) or with \n\n【24】Dacron graft. The vein is simply ligated above and below  删除换行 and the intervening part may be utilised for grafting of  删除换行 the artery.\n\n【25】2. Quadruple ligation.— When reconstruction  删除换行 operation is not possible, ligation of the involved artery  删除换行 and vein both above and below the lesion may be  删除换行 performed (with four ligatures — 2 for artery and 2 for  删除换行 the vein).\n\n【26】3. Selective intra-arterial embolisation is also a useful  删除换行 technique for treating these lesions. Autologous clot, wire,  删除换行 coil, plastic materials, or transcatheter coagulation may  删除换行 be used for this technique. Each procedure has been  删除换行 claimed as successful in closing some of the large fistulas  删除换行 what would have been difficult, if not impossible, to  删除换行 manage surgically.\n\n【27】4. In majority of patients it is possible to close the  删除换行 fistula without any distal ischaemia and subsequent am删除8：<u>￾</u>putations are not required.CHAPTER\n\n【28】STRUCTURES.—\nVENOUS ULCER 11\n\n【29】Definition.— When a vein becomes dilated, elongated  删除换行 and tortuous, the vein is said to be ‘varicose,'.\n\n【30】Sites.— The common sites of varicosity are :\n\n【31】1. Superficial venous system of the lower limbs — \n\n【32】affecting either the Long Saphenous or the Short Saphenous  删除换行 vein or the both.\n\n【33】2. Oesophageal varix (affecting veins of the gastro删除8：<u>￾</u>oesophageal junction).\n\n【34】3. Varicosity of the haeinorrhoidal veins (piles).\n\n【35】4. Varicosity of the spermatic veins (varicocele).\n\n【36】In this chapter I shall only discuss varicosity of the superficial 删除换行 venous system of the lower limbs.\n\n【37】TREATMENT.—\n\n【38】Venous drainage of the lower limbs can be conveniently  删除换行 described under 3 heads — A. Deep Veins, B. Superficial  删除换行 veins and C. Perforating or communicating veins, which  删除换行 connect the superficial with the deep veins.\n\n【39】A. DEEP VEINS.—\n\n【40】The deep veins of the lower limb accompany the arteries  删除换行 and their branches. These veins possess numerous valves. \n\n【41】The main veins are — the posterior tibial vein and its  删除换行 tributaries, the peroneal vein, the anterior tibial vein, the  删除换行 popliteal vein and the femoral vein.\n\n【42】The characteristic features of the deep veins are :\n\n【43】1. There are numerous valves in these veins. These valves  删除换行 direct the flow of the blood upwards and prevent  删除换行 regurgitation of flow downwards.\n\n【44】2. Within the soleus muscle, which is the most powerful  删除换行 muscle of the calf there are venous plexuses or sinuses. These  删除换行 are devoid of valves. These veins empty segmentary into the  删除换行 posterior tibial and the peroneal veins. These posterior tibial  删除换行 veins and the peroneal veins also receive perforating or  删除换行 communicating veins from the superficial veins and both  删除换行 these perforating veins and the soleus venous plexuses or  删除换行 sinuses may enter the same sites of these veins.\n\n【45】The importance of this surgical anatomy lies in the fact  删除换行 that :\n\n【46】(a) Deep vein thrombosis is a very common postoperative  删除换行 surgical problem which may lead to pulmonary embolism  删除换行 and death of the patient. Such deep vein thrombosis occurs  删除换行 when the calf muscles are in complete rest during the 删除换行 postoperative periods and the blood flow through the venous  删除换行 sinuses is very slow. Thus clots are formed within the blood  删除换行 and this is the starting point of deep vein thrombosis.\n\n【47】(b) Inflammation of the soleal sinuses may spread to the  删除换行 posterior tibial vein causing deep vein inflammation. Hence  删除换行 inflammation spreads to the perforating veins which damages  删除换行 the valves of the perforators and may start varicosity of the  删除换行 superficial veins as the valves in the perforators prevent flow  删除换行 of blood from deep to the superficial veins.\n\n【48】B. SUPERFICIAL VEINS.—\n\n【49】These veins lie in the subcutaneous fat between the skin  删除换行 and the deep fascia. These superficial veins of the lower limb  删除换行 are the long and short saphenous veins and their tributaries.\n\n【50】Long (great) saphenous vein.—\n\n【51】It is the longest vein in the body. It begins in the medial  删除换行 marginal vein of the foot and ends in the femoral vein about 3  删除换行 cm below the inguinal ligament. It ascends in front of the  删除换行 tibial malleolus, runs upwards crossing the lower part of the  删除换行 medial surface of the tibia obliquely to gain its medial border. \n\n【52】Then it ascends a finger's breadth behind the medial border  删除换行 of the tibia upto the knee. Here it runs upwards on the  删除换行 posterior part of the medial condyle of the tibia and the femur  删除换行 and along the medial side of the thigh to the saphenous  删除换行 opening. Saphenous opening lies about 3.5 cm below and  删除换行 lateral to the pubic tubercle. It passes through the cribriform  删除换行 fascia of the saphenous opening and ends in the femoral vein.\n\n【53】In the thigh, it is accompanied by a few branches of the  删除换行 medial femoral cutaneous nerve. At the knee it is accompanied  删除换行 by the saphenous branch of the descending genicular artery. \n\n【54】In the leg and the foot it is accompanied by the saphenous  删除换行 nerve which is placed in front of the vein.\n\n【55】There are about 10 to 20 valves in this long saphenous  删除换行 vein which are more numerous in the leg than in the thigh. \n\n【56】Of these, two valves are almost constant — one lies just  删除换行 before the vein pierces the cribriform fascia and another at  删除换行 its junction with the femoral vein (this valve is concerned  删除换行 with saphenofemoral sufficiency).\n\n【57】ARTERIOVENOUS ANEURYSM\n\n【58】1.

In the leg :\n\n【61】(i) It communicates freely with the small saphenous vein.VARICOSE VEIN AND VENOUS ULCER 145\n\n【62】(ii) Just below the knee it receives three large tributaries\n\n【63】— (a) one from the front of the leg, (b) one from the region  删除换行 of the tibial malleolus (which communicates with the  删除换行 perforating veins) and (c) one from the calf which  删除换行 communicates with the small or short saphenous vein.\n\n【64】3. In the thigh :\n\n【65】(i) A large accessory saphenous vein — which  删除换行 communicates below with the small saphenous vein. This  删除换行 receives numerous tributaries from the medial and posterior  删除换行 parts of the thigh.\n\n【66】(ii) A fairly constant large vein, sometimes called the  删除换行 anterior femoral cutaneous vein — commences from a network  删除换行 of veins on the lower part of the front of the thigh and crosses  删除换行 the apex of the femoral triangle to enter the long saphenous  删除换行 vein in the upper part of the thigh.\n\n【67】4. Near the saphenous opening \\\n\n【68】Just before the long saphenous vein pierces the saphenous  删除换行 opening it is joined by four veins —\n\n【69】(i) The superficial epigastric,\n\n【70】(ii) The superficial circumflex iliac,\n\n【71】(iii) Superficial external pudendal and\n\n【72】(iv) The deep external pudendal vein, which joins the  删除换行 great saphenous vein at the saphenous opening.\n\n【73】LOCAL SIGNS.—\n\n【74】(a) As there is communication jetween the long and the  删除换行 short saphenous veins varicosity may spread from one system  删除换行 to the other.\n\n【75】(b) At the time of operation for varicose vein, when a  删除换行 ligature is advised to the saphenofemoral junction, the veins  删除换行 draining into the long saphenous vein near the saphenous  删除换行 opening must be ligated and cut otherwise these small veins  删除换行 will attempt varicosity due to incompetent saphenofemoral  删除换行 junction.\n\n【76】(c) In case of varicosity of the long saphenous vein, the 删除换行 small veins from the sole of the foot and the ankle which  删除换行 drain into this venous system through the medial marginal  删除换行 vein becomes dilated and this gives rise to swelling of the  删除换行 ankle, which is known as ‘ankle flare’.\n\n【77】Short (small) saphenous vein.—\n\n【78】This vein begins behind the lateral malleolus as a  删除换行 continuation of the lateral marginal vein of the foot. It first  删除换行 ascends along the lateral border of the tendo Achilles and then  删除换行 along the midline of the back of the leg. It perforates the deep  删除换行 fascia and passes between the two heads of the Gastrocnemius  删除换行 in the lower part of the popliteal fossa and ends in the popliteal  删除换行 vein 3 to 7.5 cm above the level of the knee joint.\n\n【79】In the leg it is in close relation with the sural nerve.\n\n【80】This vein possesses 7 to 13 valves, one of which is always  删除换行 found near its termination in the popliteal vein. \n\n【81】SYSTEMIC SIGNS.—\n\n【82】It sends several tributaries upwards and medially to join  删除换行 the long saphenous vein. The most important communicating  删除换行 branch arises from the small saphenous vein before it pierces  删除换行 the deep fascia and passes upwards and medially to join the  删除换行 accessory saphenous vein. This communication may  删除换行 occasionally form the main continuation of the short  删除换行 saphenous vein.\n\n【83】C. PERFORATING OR COMMUNICATING VEINS.—\n\n【84】These veins communicate between the superficial and  删除换行 deep veins. These always pierce the deep fascia. There are  删除换行 valves within these veins which under normal conditions  删除换行 allow blood to flow from the superficial to the deep veins. \n\n【85】Only when these valves become incompetent blood may flow  删除换行 in the opposite direction and thus leads to varicosity of the  删除换行 superficial veins.\n\n【86】When the calf muscles contract the blood is pumped  删除换行 upwards in the deep veins and blood flow into the superficial  删除换行 veins is prevented by the valves in the perforating veins.\n\n【87】10146 A TEXTBOOK ON SURGICAL SHORT CASES\n\n【88】During relaxation of the calf muscles blood is aspirated from  删除换行 the superficial into the deep veins. If the valves in the  删除换行 perforating vein become incompetent these veins become  删除换行 ‘high pressure leaks’ during muscular contraction and this  删除换行 transmission of the high pressure in the deep veins to the  删除换行 superficial veins results in dilatation and degeneration of the  删除换行 superficial veins producing varicose veins. Perforating veins  删除换行 are of two types :\n\n【89】(a) INDIRECT PERFORATORS.— There are  删除换行 numerous small vessels which start from the superficial venous  删除换行 system, pierce the deep fascia and communicate with a vessel  删除换行 in an underlying muscle. The latter vessel in turn is connected  删除换行 with the deep vein. These indirect perforators are mostly  删除换行 seen in the upper part of the leg.\n\n【90】(b) DIRECT PERFORATORS.— These veins directly  删除换行 connect the saphenous veins or their tributaries to the deep  删除换行 veins. A few of these direct veins are constant in number and  删除换行 site. These are :—\n\n【91】(i) In the thigh.— Between the long saphenous and the  删除换行 femoral vein in the adductor canal.\n\n【92】(ii) In the leg.— The perforators in the leg are divided  删除换行 into three groups :—\n\n【93】(a) Medial perforating veins.— There are three  删除换行 constant medial leg perforators situated in line with the  删除换行 posterior border of the tibia 2 inches (5 cm), 4 inches (10  删除换行 cm) and 6 inches (15 cm) above the medial malleolus. The  删除换行 upper two enter the posterior tibial vein where an unvalved  删除换行 soleal venous sinus also enters it. The importance of this is  删除换行 that the soleal venous sinuses are devoid of valves. Moreover  删除换行 the clot arising in the soleal veins may extend into the  删除换行 posterior tibial vein and then into the perforating veins thus  删除换行 destroying the valves of the perforators. The lowest perforator  删除换行 has a short course connecting long saphenous with the  删除换行 posterior tibial vein.\n\n【94】. (b) Central perforating veins.— One or two veins  删除换行 connect the short saphenous system to the veins in the  删除换行 gastrocnemius and soleus muscles. Whereas one enters the  删除换行 muscle on the medial side close to its junction with the  删除换行 tendo Achilles, the other is situated further up in the calf.\n\n【95】(c) Lateral perforating veins.— There are inconstant  删除换行 perforators of the posterior border of the fibula. These pass  删除换行 at the levels of 2 inches (5 cm), 5 inches (12 cm) and 7  删除换行 inches (17 cm) above the lateral malleolus. These are  删除换行 connected with the peroneal veins.\n删除3：<u>Fig. 11.2 .— Demonstrates the lower part of the long saphenous </u>\n\n【96】vein with its main tributaries and perforators.

AN presents more frequently in women but has a poorer prognosis when diagnosed in men. The clinical presentation of patients affected with AN consists of nodular red-violaceous lesions in the frontoparietal scalp with or without scaling. Although AN most commonly occurs after the diagnosis of the primary tumor, diagnosis of AN may be challenging especially if its onset occurs prior to the primary tumor diagnosis. The histological findings of AN consist of the metastatic carcinoma cells infiltrating into the dermis and subcutaneous tissue, fibrosis of the dermis and subcutaneous tissue, the loss of pilosebaceous units, and the pleomorphic cellular morphology that is typical of adenocarcinoma. The proposed mechanism of AN involves the release of cytokines from metastatic carcinoma cells leading to fibrosis and destruction of pilosebaceous units. The identification of skin metastases plays a role in staging and treatment of the disease, making it vital to identify them early. Treatment of AN is primarily focused on systemic treatment for the primary tumor. Although case reports of regrowth are present, patients should be counseled on the scarring nature of the hair loss as well as the generally poorer prognosis associated with AN.\n\n【13】Keywords\n\n【14】Alopecia neoplastica Cutaneous metastasis Metastatic carcinoma D2–40 Chemotherapy\n\n【15】A 70-year-old male presented with a nodule on the right temporal scalp. It was present for about 4 months. He had no significant health problems but was a smoker since age 17. He denied weight loss, fever, or chills. He reported mild fatigue, but he attributed it to working as a truck driver and having long hours lately.\n\n【16】On physical examination, a 1.5 cm subcutaneous fixed nodule was observed on the right temporal scalp. The hair was absent in that area. The remaining scalp exam was within normal limits. The eyebrows, eyelashes, and fingernails were normal on exam. A biopsy was performed and revealed a poorly differentiated carcinoma with variably sized dark blue nuclei within scant cytoplasm, molding, and crush artifact. Staining with synaptophysin and TTF-1 was positive and CD45 was negative.\n\n【17】Based on the clinical case description, what is the cause of his alopecia?\n\n【18】1.  1.\n\n【19】    Renal cell carcinoma metastases\n\n【20】2.  2.\n\n【21】    Small cell carcinoma of the lung metastases\n\n【22】3.  3.\n\n【23】    Melanoma metastases\n\n【24】4.  4.\n\n【25】    Lymphoma\n\n【26】Diagnosis\n---------\n\n【27】Small cell carcinoma of the lung.\n\n【28】Discussion\n----------\n\n【29】The prevalence of skin metastases (SM) ranges from 0.7% to 9% in patients with internal tumors, and the estimated rate of SM is approximately 5.3% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Alopecia neoplastica (AN) is a rare form of cutaneous metastasis that accounts for 4% of all cases of cutaneous metastases and involves the spread of an underlying cancer to the scalp, with an overall incidence ranging from 0.7% to 0.9% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Women are more frequently affected by AN than men, but men with AN have a worse prognosis. Metastases most commonly originate from primary visceral tumors, most of which are of breast tissue origin. Other sources of primary tumors for AN include gastrointestinal, cervical, and trophoblast tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 – 5 \\]</u>. Rarely, desmoplastic melanoma, a subtype of melanoma characterized by atypical spindle-shaped melanocytes and abundant collagen deposition, can present as primary AN 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>. Although AN most commonly occurs after the diagnosis of the primary tumor, diagnosis of AN may be challenging especially if its onset occurs prior to the primary tumor diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. In approximately 17% of AN cases, skin metastases may occur before or at the same time as the detection of the primary cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. While skin metastases can help identify new primary tumors, they can also play an important role in the surveillance of cancers thought to be in remission. The identification of skin metastases plays a role in staging and treatment of the disease, making it vital to identify them early.\n\n【30】The clinical presentation of AN most frequently consists of a localized asymptomatic nodular scarring alopecia with red-violaceous or flesh-colored nodular lesions on the frontal or parietal region of the scalp. The erythematous appearance of AN lesions is explained by the fact that the scalp has a relatively high blood supply 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. It is common for AN to present as single or multiple nontender nodules, and the affected area of the scalp is distinctly erythematous with or without scaling, sometimes covering a subcutaneous nodule or presenting with multiple overlying telangiectasias 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Severe itching has also been reported in some cases of AN, leading to the false diagnosis of eczema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Furthermore, the diagnosis of AN can be justified by the persistence of hair loss in well-defined areas of the scalp after the secondary effects of chemotherapy have subsided 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】Histologically, AN is characterized as an adenocarcinoma due to the relatively high density of glands in the scalp 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Histological examination also reveals metastatic carcinoma cells in a dense collagenous stroma infiltrating into the dermis and subcutaneous tissue, along with loss of pilosebaceous units 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The dermis is fibrotic, and metastatic cells are present in the reticular dermis or subcutaneous tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. The cells can also be found in a single-file configuration between layers of fibrotic collagen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 \\]</u>. Histologic characteristics of AN are consistent with findings commonly associated with cancerous tissue, such as nuclear atypia, pleomorphic and hyperchromatic spindle-shaped cells, and molecular profiles consistent with the primary tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 6 \\]</u>. Additional staining may be needed to determine the primary tumor pathology. For instance, AN from primary gastric adenocarcinomas may stain positively for MSH-2, and AN from primary breast cancer may stain positively for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and CK7 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【32】The mechanism of AN is not well known; however, it is likely that the fibrosis from the release of cytokines by metastatic carcinoma cells may cause the loss of hair follicles 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Additionally, tumor invasion and destruction of hair sheaths may be involved in the formation of areas of alopecia since hair can be regrown after the completion of effective cancer treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Furthermore, cutaneous metastases to the scalp from primary breast cancer are mediated through lymphatic vessels, irrespective of the clinical features of the primary tumor, according to a 2011 study of the lymphatic-specific marker D2–40 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【33】Treatment\n---------\n\n【34】Treatment of AN most often involves systemic treatment of the primary tumor by chemotherapy. Surgical excision alone or in combination with radiotherapy or chemotherapy is used less commonly, and chemotherapy remains the most frequently reported method of treatment for AN 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Following successful treatment of the primary tumor, it is possible to restore the hair follicles in non-scarring areas of alopecia that were formed due to chemotherapy-induced hair loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【35】As the alopecia is caused by a cutaneous metastasis of a visceral malignancy, treatment is focused on the primary tumor pathology. With systemic treatment, the hope is that scalp metastases will regress, thus making hair regrowth possible. It is important to counsel patients on the scarring nature of the metastasis, and that systemic treatment of the cancer may result in further alopecia that is non-scarring in nature. Cosmetic remedies such as wigs may be an option based on patients’ personal preferences. As this presentation of hair loss is generally a distant metastasis, staging will be advanced, suggesting a poorer prognosis, and patients should be counseled on this as well.\n\n【36】Although AN generally results in a scarring form of hair loss due to fibrosis, there have been case reports where regrowth was reported with systemic treatment. For instance, a case report of a patient with breast cancer and scalp metastasis illustrated that systemic treatment provided the possibility of hair regrowth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Although there was progressive drug-induced alopecia due to tamoxifen treatment, the patient’s scalp metastasis regressed at the end of the treatment course. Additionally, 2 years post-treatment, hair regrowth was evident. The regrowth was most likely possible due to non-fibrotic causes of the initial hair loss such as tumor invasion of the hair sheath 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Therefore, treatment of the underlying malignancy would result in regrowth in areas of alopecia.\n\n【37】Key Points\n----------\n\n【38】*   Alopecia neoplastica often presents as erythematous nodular lesions and telangiectasias on the frontoparietal scalp and is associated with visceral tumors, most commonly originating in gastrointestinal or breast tissue.\n\n【39】*   Systemic treatment targeted at the primary tumor is the mainstay of treatment for alopecia neoplastica.\n\n【40】*   Despite the rarity of alopecia neoplastica, patients who present with new atypical areas of scalp alopecia should be thoroughly evaluated to ensure the hair loss is not due to cutaneous metastasis of a visceral malignancy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Children <7 years cannot perform PEFR  删除换行 reliably and technique in sick children is often poor\n\n【25】Acute management goals are to correct hypoxia, reverse airway obstruction and prevent  删除换行 progression. Reassurance and calm are crucial because he will be frightened. Give high-flow  删除换行 oxygen via mask and monitor saturations. Start a regular inhaled beta-agonist (e.g. salbutamol) \n\n【26】via a nebulizer. Beta-agonists can be given continuously. If so, cardiac monitoring is needed  删除换行 as side effects include irritability, tremor, tachycardia and hypokalaemia. Inhaled ipratropium  删除换行 bromide can be added. Give oral prednisolone or intravenous (IV) hydrocortisone. Frequent  删除换行 clinical review is paramount. Blood gases (capillary or venous) and a chest X-ray may be  删除换行 required. If there is no improvement or Bradley’s condition deteriorates, additional treatment  删除换行 is needed. These include IV salbutamol, IV magnesium sulphate (a smooth muscle relaxant) \n\n【27】and IV aminophylline, although the effectiveness of the latter two is still controversial. His  删除换行 precipitating ‘cold’ is almost certainly viral and antibiotics are unlikely to be beneficial.\n\n【28】Before discharge, a thorough review of Bradley’s asthma is needed:\n\n【29】• How often does he miss his regular drugs?\n\n【30】• Is there parental supervision?\n\n【31】• What device does he use?

This  删除换行 should improve adherence.\n\n【35】• Ask about smoking – Bradley and his family. Adults should be encouraged to stop  删除换行 smoking or to smoke outside.\n\n【36】• Educate about allergen avoidance, for example, daily vacuuming to reduce house  删除换行 dust mites. Consider measuring total immunoglobulin E (IgE) and specific allergen \n\n【37】IgE ( formerly called a RAST) if the history suggests allergies.\n\n【38】• All asthmatics should have a written home management plan.\n\n【39】• Provide an asthma symptom diary and arrange hospital follow-up until control  删除换行 improves.

The most likely unifying cause of these symp删除8：<u>￾</u>toms and signs is ankylosing spondylitis (AS).

The inflammation leads to symptoms of pain and stiffness,  删除换行 while fibrosis and ossification at these sites generates signs of increasing spinal restric删除8：<u>￾</u>tion. One such clinical measure of spinal restriction is Schober’s index: two marks on  删除换行 the lumbar spine 15 cm apart (5 cm below and 10 cm above the posterior superior iliac  删除换行 spines) should increase to >20 cm apart on forward flexion; lateral spinal flexion and  删除换行 cervical neck movements should also be assessed regularly. In late-stage disease, patients  删除换行 may develop a ‘question-mark’ posture with loss of lumbar lordosis, exaggerated thoracic  删除换行 kyphosis and hyperextension at the neck. Complete spinal fusion (ankylosis) may occur  删除换行 and is surprisingly painless, unless microfractures develop due to spinal rigidity and  删除换行 concomitant osteoporosis.\n\n【27】Although AS is dominated by axial disease, large-joint peripheral arthropathy (hip and  删除换行 knee), enthesopathy and tendinopathy may also develop. Extra-articular features include  删除换行 anterior uveitis, which occurs in up to 40 per cent of patients (with no relation to spinal  删除换行 disease activity), apical pulmonary fibrosis and aortic regurgitation.\n\n【28】Treatment for AS focuses on physiotherapy and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs \n\n【29】(NSAIDs). In view of the risk of chest wall fusion following costochondritis or costover删除8：<u>￾</u>tebritis and possible restrictive lung disease, this patient must also be advised to give up  删除换行 smoking.

In younger and  删除换行 milder cases of cystic fibrosis, the predominant organisms in the sputum are Haemophilus  删除换行 influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus. Later, as more lung damage occurs, Pseudomonas  删除换行 aeruginosa is a common pathogen. Once present in the lungs in cystic fibrosis, it is difficult or  删除换行 impossible to remove it completely.\n\n【15】Cystic fibrosis should always be considered when there is a story of repeated chest infec删除8：<u>￾</u>tions in a young person. Although it presents most often below the age of 20 years, diagnosis  删除换行 may be delayed until the 20s, 30s, 40s or later in milder cases. Associated problems occur in  删除换行 the pancreas (malabsorption, diabetes), sinuses and liver. It has become evident that some  删除换行 patients are affected more mildly, especially those with the less-common genetic variants. \n\n【16】These milder cases may only be affected by the chest problems of cystic fibrosis and have little  删除换行 or no malabsorption from the pancreatic insufficiency.\n\n【17】! Differential diagnosis\n\n【18】The differential diagnosis in this young man would be other causes of diffuse bron删除8：<u>￾</u>chiectasis, such as agammaglobulinaemia or immotile cilia. Respiratory function  删除换行 should be measured to see the degree of functional impairment. Bronchiectasis in  删除换行 the upper lobes may occur in tuberculosis or in allergic bronchopulmonary aspergil删除8：<u>￾</u>losis associated with asthma.\n\n【19】The common diagnostic test for cystic fibrosis is to measure the electrolytes in the sweat,  删除换行 where there is an abnormally high concentration of sodium and chloride. At the age of 19  删除换行 years, the sweat test may be less reliable. It is more specific if repeated after the administration  删除换行 of fludrocortisone. An alternative would be to have the potential difference across the nasal  删除换行 epithelium measured at a centre with a special interest in cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis has  删除换行 an autosomal recessive inheritance with the commonest genetic abnormality DF508 found  删除换行 in 85 per cent of cases. The gene is responsible for the protein controlling chloride transport  删除换行 across the cell membrane. The commoner genetic abnormalities can be identified, and the  删除换行 current battery of genetic tests identifies well over 95 per cent of cases. However, the absence  删除换行 of DF508 and other common abnormalities would not rule out cystic fibrosis related to the  删除换行 less-common genetic variants.\n\n【20】In later stages, lung transplantation can be considered. Since the identification of the genetic  删除换行 abnormality, trials of gene-replacement therapy have begun.\n\n【21】Management should be at a centre with experience in the management of adult cystic fibrosis. \n\n【22】Treatment at such centres for children, adolescents and adults is associated with improved  删除换行 outcomes.Case 3: Chronic Cough\n\n【23】删除5：<u>11</u>\nKEY POINTS\n\n【24】•\t Milder forms of cystic fibrosis may present in adolescence and adulthood.\n\n【25】•\t Milder forms are often related to less-common genetic abnormalities.\n\n【26】•\t A high-resolution CT scan is the best way to detect bronchiectasis and to define its  删除换行 extent.\n\n【27】•\t Management should be at an experienced cystic fibrosis centre.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

E： Viral skin swab**\n\n【23】**Q2. B： Oral aciclovir**\n\n【24】**Q3. D： Ophthalmologist**\n\n【25】**Eczema herpeticum is caused by an infection of the skin by the herpes simplex virus (HSV) which can be severe and potentially life-threatening. Infection with HSV 1 is more common than HSV 2. Children of all ages and ethnic groups can be affected and the highest incidence is in those aged 2-3 years. In most cases the patient is known to have a history of eczema 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>. It usually presents as a deterioration of eczema accompanied by pain， lethargy and systemic upset. The rash of eczema herpeticum is vesicular often with crusting and punched out lesions that can coalesce. Any cutaneous site can be affected but most commonly there is involvement of the limbs. To confirm the diagnosis a viral swab should be taken and is the most important investigation when Bala first presents. Sensitivity is highest in the first 24-48 hours after an active vesicular lesion has appeared. Serum viral PCR is more sensitive and has good specificity but is not usually necessary due to cost implications 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u>. A bacterial swab should also be performed as co-infection with staphylococcus aureus can complicate eczema herpeticum.**\n\n【26】**Bala should be referred for an urgent dermatological opinion and treatment started immediately. The most important treatment is aciclovir. If the child is systemically unwell they should be admitted for intravenous aciclovir and fluid replacement. However， if the patient is systemically well aciclovir should be given orally. It is important to start aciclovir sooner rather than later and should be done so whilst awaiting virological confirmation. The recommended course duration for both intravenous and oral aciclovir is usually 5 days although sometimes longer courses are needed， and patients who are immunosuppressed require higher doses. Other supportive measures such as fluids and pain relief should also be instigated if necessary.**\n\n【27】**Clinicians are advised to be cautious with the use of topical steroids in eczema herpeticum as their use can potentially worsen the condition. Initial treatment should focus on anti-viral +/- antibacterial therapy. Periorbital involvement requires urgent referral to an ophthalmologist to look for corneal ulceration.**\n\n【28】**In children， atopic dermatitis or eczema is most commonly the earliest sign of atopy. This may be followed by allergic rhinitis， asthma and food allergy in the 'atopic march'. The discovery of “loss-of-function” mutations in genes encoding the protein filaggrin has led to a much greater understanding about the pathophysiology surrounding eczema 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u>. Filaggrin is an important epidermal protein expressed in the outer layers of the epidermis and plays a vital role in skin barrier function 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u>. Filaggrin gene mutations ultimately result in a deficiency of filaggrin and this is known to play a critical role in the development of atopic dermatitis 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u>. The clinical diagnosis of atopic dermatitis is based on a history of ill-defined itchy， dry， erythematous patches. These commonly affect flexural areas， although non-flexural areas are often affected especially in the young and there is commonly a family history of atopy.**\n\n【29】**Emollients**\n\n【30】**All children with atopic dermatitis should be offered the choice of un-perfumed emollients to use on a daily basis for moisturising， washing and bathing. They act by providing an effective barrier layer over the skin， decreasing moisture loss and protecting against irritants. There is a wide range available and choice should**\n\n【31】**be suited to the child's needs and preferences with a combination being offered. Emollients should be prescribed in large quantities (250-500g weekly) and should be available at home， nursery and school.**\n\n【32】**Topical steroids**\n\n【33】**Topical steroids play an important part of treatment in eczema. They should be applied to areas of active eczema at the appropriate strength required to induce remission 通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u>. A general rule is to use a topical steroid that settles eczema twice a day for 5-7 days and then reduce the frequency of application or potency. Areas of crusted or infected eczema may respond better to a steroid/antibiotic or a steroid/antiseptic combination. Local side effects， such as telangiectasia on cheeks and striae can be minimized if the appropriate steroid strength is used 通用删除7(英):<u>(7)</u>.**\n\n【34】**As a general rule：**\n\n【35】**Use a mild potency steroid for mild atopic eczema i.e. hydrocortisone**\n\n【36】**Use a moderate potency steroid for moderate atopic eczema i.e. Clobetasone butyrate 0.05%**\n\n【37】**_LUs_ e a potent steroid for severe atopic eczema i.e. betamethasone 0.1%**\n\n【38】**Other treatments**\n\n【39】**Topical calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus and pimecrolimus) are recommended as second or third-line agents in moderate to severe eczema and are licensed in patients aged 2 years and older. They do not cause skin thinning although those with a specialist interest in dermatology mostly prescribe them. Some patients may require regular application of dry or wet bandages to occlude topical treatments and help improve acute flare-ups. If available， this can be organised through a specialist department.**\n\n【40】**Psychosocial aspects**\n\n【41】**Moderate-severe eczema has a significant impact on quality of life of patients and their families.

{"seq_id": "b4d9d75c-b532-41a4-87c5-d5c862c97bac", "title": null, "text": "【0】**Question**: A group of scientists decides to conduct a study addressing the long-term effects of maternal alcohol consumption on their infants after conception. Two hundred women, including those who suffer from alcoholism and those who do not, are recruited into the study when they present for their first primary care visit. A medical history is taken on alcohol use, prenatal care, nutritional status, and smoking behaviors; these are measured monthly during the pregnancy. The researchers follow the women’s pregnancies until term, after which they devote their attention to the health and behaviors of the offspring. Which of the following is the most appropriate statistic the researchers will be able to calculate as a result of their study?\n\n【1】> (A) Attributable risk of offspring abnormalities in mothers who smoke\n\n【2】> (B) Odds ratio of offspring abnormalities in mothers who consume alcohol during pregnancy\n\n【3】> (C) Prevalence of alcohol consumption during pregnancy\n\n【4】> (D) Proportion of all offspring abnormalities that are due to alcohol consumption during pregnancy\n\n【5】> (E) Relative risk of offspring abnormalities in mothers who consume alcohol during pregnancy\n\n【6】 **Answer**: The correct answer is E. The study described here is a cohort study, because it includes a group with and a group without a given risk factor (fetal exposure to alcohol) and then looks at whether the risk factor changes the chances of offspring getting the disease (abnormalities). The study is prospective, because the group members are looked at before the disease (abnormality) develops in the offspring. Relative risk can be calculated from the results of a cohort study by comparing the rate of disease in the group with the risk factor to the rate of disease in the group without the risk factor.  \n\n【7】Answer A is incorrect. Attributable risk can be calculated from the results of a cohort study and describes the proportion of disease that is due to the risk factor under study. Although smoking behavior of the women is being recorded, the study is not designed to look at the impact of this risk factor on fetal abnormality; the rate of smoking in the two groups of women is unknown, and thus we do not know whether there are sufficient numbers of women in the “exposed” and “unexposed” groups when it comes to tobacco.  \n\n【8】Answer B is incorrect. An odds ratio is similar to relative risk, but it is calculated from the results of a case-control study, not from a cohort study. Because birth abnormality is a relatively rare outcome, the odds ratio from a case-control study would likely closely approximate the actual relative risk.  \n\n【9】Answer C is incorrect. Prevalence is a measure of how many cases of a given disease exist in a population that is at risk for that disease. This is not the best answer in this case, because there are no data to judge whether this group of 200 women represents the true prevalence of alcoholism during pregnancy in the community.  \n\n【10】Answer D is incorrect. The statistic described in this answer is the population attributable risk (PAR), which helps us understand, in a given population, how much less common a disease (fetal abnormality) would be if a given risk factor (alcohol consumption during pregnancy) were completely eliminated. To calculate PAR, the attributable risk is multiplied by the prevalence of the risk factor in the population, which would not be known in this study.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Nearly all older males have some degree of BPH with symptoms that vary in sever-ity and frequency. In general， the BPH Symptoms Score outlined in Table 57-1 can be used to determine whether the symptoms are mild， moderate， or severe.\n\n【16】The BPH score is based on patient responses from the following questions：\n\n【17】1\\. How often do you have the sensation of not completely emptying you bladder after you finished urinating?\n\n【18】2\\.

These include prostate cancer， urethral stricture， bladder and or ureteral stones， bladder tumors， prostatitis， cystitis， and neurogenic bladder. This patient s initial assessment should include a detailed review of systems， detailed history of current symptoms，physical examination to rule out neurologic abnormalities， and laboratory evaluation includ-ing CBC， chemistry panel， urinalysis， and a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test. The digital rectal examination is an important component of the workup because it gives us information regarding the size， contour， and consistency of the prostate.\n\n【27】**Treatment**\n\n【28】Men with BPH and LUTS who are not bothered by their symptoms do not need specific treatments. Instead these men can be managed by a watchful waiting approach. Included in the watchful waiting strategy are serial monitoring of symp-toms and serum creatinine， and education regarding life style modifications which include： 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> reducing fluid intake at specific times to reduce urinary frequency at inconvenient times，通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> using relaxed and double-voiding technique，通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> eliminating or limiting caffeine， alcohol， and/ or other foods that have diuretic and/ or irritat-ing effects on the bladder， 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> urethral milking may help reduce or prevent post-void dribble， 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> bladder retraining by encouraging men to delay urination when having the urge may help gradually increase their bladder capacity， 通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u> treatment of constipation， 通用删除7(英):<u>(7)</u> adjusting medications to replace or eliminate diuretics and other medications that may produce bladder symptoms. After addressing other potential causes of LUTS， and if the patient’s symptoms are bothersome， either an a-1-antagonist or a 5-a-reductase inhibitor can be started concurrently with the instructions for life style modifications to help address the symptoms related to his BPH.\n\n【29】**APPROACHTO：**\n\n【30】**Male Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms and BPH**\n\n【31】**DEFINITIONS**\n\n【32】MICTURITION：The physiologic act of voiding. This involves contraction of the detrusor (bladder muscle) followed by relaxation of the bladder neck and other urinary sphincters to allow for unrestricted and complete emptying of the bladder in a single setting.\n\n【33】**LOWER URINARY TRACT SYMPTOMS (LUTS)： These symptoms include complaints regarding bladder storage， voiding， and postmicturition symptoms. LUTS can be produced or aggravated by BPH， over-reactive bladder detrusor muscle， and polyuria. It is best to identify the actual cause(s) of LUTS before initiating treatment.**\n\n【34】DIGITAL RECTAL EXAMINATION： The prostate is palpated with gloved examination finger inserted into the rectum. The normal prostate has the“feel”of the thenar eminence of the thumb .\n\n【35】URODYNAMICS TESTING： This is a testing procedure that is performed in men and women to help determine how well the bladder stores and empties urine on demand. This testing generally involves the placement of a manometry catheter into the bladder and sometimes a second manometer in the rectum. The bladder is then slowly filled with warm water and patient is asked about sensation and asked to indicate when there is an urge to urinate. Urinary flow measurements are then\n删除3：<u>**Figure 57-1. Adig ital rectal examination is performed to detect nodularity in the prostate gland.**</u>\n\n【36】taken as the patient is asked to empty his/ her bladder. Results of this study may be helpful to further identify the cause(s) of LUTS in a man.\n\n【37】PROSTATE-SPECIFIC-ANTIGEN (PSA)： A serum protein that is produced by the prostate. PSA elevation most often reflects pathology and processes specific to the prostate. PSA elevation can occur as the result of increased patient age，prostate cancer， prostatitis， and benign prostatic hyperplasia.\n\n【38】**CLINICAL APPROACH**\n\n【39】Patients with LUTS may present with bladder storage， voiding， and/or post-micturition symptoms. Specifically， the complaints may include urinary urgency， urinary frequency， nocturia， feelings related to incomplete bladder emptying， dif-ficulty/ pain with urination， bladder infections， or decreased urinary stream. The history and physical examination is helpful to sort out the symptoms and possible causes. The digital rectal examination helps characterize prostate size， consistency， and identify abnormal nodularities or tenderness. Abnormal findings during digi-tal rectal examination may be further evaluated by transrectal ultrasonography. Patients with moderate or severe LUTS may benefit from lifestyle management and medication(s)， or surgical treatment.Medications for LUTS often can produce side-effects， therefore patients need to be appropriately counseled and followed.\n\n【40】**Medications for LUTS**\n\n【41】Alpha-blockers： Prostate contraction causes narrowing of the bladder neck and decreasing urine flow； prostate contraction is nearly exclusively mediated by alphala-receptor stimulation. a-Blockers cause prostate relaxation and increase in bladder neck and prostatic urethra diameter increase and increase in urine flow. This type of medication generally will produce symptoms improvement within days after treatment initiation. Medications in this class include alfuzosin， doxa-zosin， tamsulosin， terazosin， and silodosin. Most common side-effects associated with a-blockers are weakness， abnormal ejaculation， and orthostatic hypotension.\n\n【42】5-a-Reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs)： These agents block the conversion of testos-terone to dihydrotestosterone in the prostatic stroma resulting in the reduction in prostate size. Patients’clinical responses to this class of medications generally are delayed by several months. Major side-effects are reduction in libido， erectile dys-function，and abnormal ejaculation.\n\n【43】**Muscarinic-receptor antagonists： Muscarinic receptors are highly expressed in bladder smooth muscle cells， prostate， and bladder urothelial cells. Muscarinic-receptor blockade reduces bladder contraction and bladder sensory threshold(reduces urinary urgency). These drugs are mainly used for the treatment of over-active bladder in men and women. Side-effects include dry mouth， constipation， micturition difficulties， and dizziness.**\n\n【44】**Vasopressin analogue (desmopressin)： This drug controls urine production by binding to the V2 receptor in the renal collecting ducts. The medication causes water reabsorption and decreases in water excretion. This medication is helpful for the management of patients with bothersome nocturia. The medication for these patients would be taken once at bedtime.**\n\n【45】Combination therapy： a-1-Blockers and 5-a-reductase inhibitors are often com-bined to treat patients with LUTS from BPH. Combination therapy may be indi-cated for patients with moderate to severe LUTS associated with high prostate volume， higher PSA， and advanced age， as these are risk factors for disease progres-sion and future need for surgical treatment.\n\n【46】**SURGICAL TREATMENTOF BPH-RELATED LUTS**\n\n【47】Transurethral resection of prostate (TURP)： This procedure involves resection ofthe transition zone of the prostate.TURP is indicated for patients with severe bladder outlet obstruction secondary to a large prostate. Alternatively， transurethral inci-sion of the bladder (TUIP) is an option for some patients. The size of the prostate is often the basis determining selection of TURP versus TUIP. Long-term com-plications associated with these procedures include urinary incontinence， bladder neck strictures， retrograde ejaculation， and erectile dysfunction.\n\n【48】Transurethral needle ablation (TUNA)： This treatment involves the delivery of low-level radiofrequency energy through a needle inserted into the prostate. The pro-cedure produces controlled destruction of the prostate and relief of bladder outlet obstruction.

She also complained of  删除换行 swelling around the eyes and over the feet, loss of appetite and occasional vomiting. \n\n【4】The lady was a known case of diabetes mellitus since 25 years and systemic  删除换行 hypertension for the last 12 years. She sustained an anterior wall myocardial  删除换行 infarction four years back, for which she was thrombolysed. At that time, coronary  删除换行 angiography showed triple-vessel disease, but she declined a revascularization  删除换行 procedure. Her serum creatinine value was found to be high and therefore, she  删除换行 was switched over from oral antidiabetic drugs to insulin therapy. The patient also  删除换行 underwent laser photocoagulation for proliferative retinopathy, one year back. She  删除换行 was presently undergoing maintenance hemodialysis, thrice a week. \n\n【5】On examination, the patient was drowsy, disoriented and obviously dyspneic. \n\n【6】The complexion was pale and sallow with dry skin that bore marks of pruritus. \n\n【7】There was periorbital puffiness and pitting edema over the ankles and lower legs. \n\n【8】The neck veins were engorged but there was no cyanosis or icterus. The pulse rate  删除换行 was 92 beats/min. with a BP of 160/94 mm Hg. The precordium was unremarkable  删除换行 and the apex beat was displaced to the left. The S1\n\n【9】 was normal with a loud A2\n\n【10】 and  删除换行 a S3\n\n【11】 sound in early diastole. An ejection murmur was audible along the left sternal  删除换行 border. No pericardial friction rub was audible. There were bilateral basilar rales over  删除换行 the lung fields. An ECG was obtained  following which she was immediately  删除换行 given an injection. Her laboratory reports were Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL% Urine sugar \n\n【12】+1 albumin +2, Glucose 144 mg/dl, Urea 124 mg/dl, Creatinine 5.2 mg/dl, Sodium  删除换行 129 mEq/L, Potassium 6.8 mEq/L and Calcium 7.4 mg%. \n\n【13】 Figure 37.1: ECG showing tall T waves with flat P waves170 Section 11 Typical ECG Abnormalities\n\n【14】Table 37.1: ECG features of progressive hyperkalemia\n\n【15】A.

When  删除换行 the serum level exceeds 6.8 mEq/L, tall T waves and short Q-T interval are seen. \n\n【20】When it exceeds 8.4 mEq/L, additionally the P wave gets flattened and the P-R  删除换行 interval gets prolonged. At a serum level which is in excess of 9.1 mEq/L, the QRS  删除换行 complex also becomes wide and ventricular arrhythmias occur .\n删除3：<u>Figure 37.2: ECG features of progressively increasing hyperkalemia</u>\n\n【21】ECG INTERPRETATION \n\n【22】The ECG showed normal sinus rhythm. The P wave was flattened and the P-R  删除换行 interval was prolonged. There were no significant Q waves and the S-T segment  删除换行 was isoelectric. The T wave was upright, tall and peaked. The Q-T interval was  删除换行 short. These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of hyperkalemia. A \n\n【23】T-wave that exceeds a voltage of 5 mm in the standard leads and 10 mm in the  删除换行 precordial leads is considered tall. Besides hyperkalemia, causes of tall T wave  删除换行 are myocardial ischemia and the hyperacute phase of myocardial infarction. The \n\n【24】T wave of hyperkalemia is tall, peaked symmetrical and has a narrow base, the so  删除换行 called ‘tented’ T wave. The Q-T interval is short. On the other hand, the T wave of  删除换行 coronary insufficiency is tall but broad-based and the Q-T interval is prolonged. \n\n【25】The normal Q-T interval is 0.39 + 0.04 sec. and ranges from 0.35 to \n\n【26】0.43 sec. A Q-T interval measuring less than 0.35 sec is considered short. Besides  删除换行 hyperkalemia, causes of short Q-T interval are hypercalcemia and digitalis toxicity. \n\n【27】Hyperkalemia shortens the Q-T interval and is associated with tall T waves, wide \n\n【28】QRS complexes and diminished P waves. Hypercalcemia also shortens the Q-T  删除换行 interval but there are no changes in the morphology of the QRS deflection. The  删除换行 proximal limb of the T-wave has an abrupt upslope to its peak.

Variation in the blood levels of potassium and calcium  删除换行 are chiefly responsible for these ECG changes. Abnormal levels of calcium and  删除换行 magnesium produce similar changes. Hypercalcemia shortens the Q-T interval  删除换行 while hypocalcemia prolongs it. \n\n【49】There are several causes of hyperkalemia which have been enlisted in \n\n【50】Table 37.2. True gain of potassium is often due to hemolysis, rhabdomyolysis,  删除换行 burns or tumour lysis. Redistribution of potassium occurs in metabolic acidosis \n\n【51】(extracellular shift), with beta-blocker therapy and in severe insulin deficiency. \n\n【52】Hyperkalemia is a feature of hypoaldosteronism due to Addison’s disease or  删除换行 acute on chronic renal failure. Drugs known to cause hyperkalemia include  删除换行 potassium-sparing diuretics, non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),  删除换行 and the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Genetic causes of  删除换行 hyperkalemia are Type 4 renal tubular acidosis (RTA-4) and hyperkalemic  删除换行 periodic paralysis. \n\n【53】The clinical picture of hyperkalemia depends upon the cause. The most  删除换行 common scenario is of acute on chronic renal failure with fluid overload,  删除换行 hypertension and metabolic acidosis, which are characteristic features of uremia. \n\n【54】Sometimes, hyperkalemia is a part of diabetic ketoacidosis. At other times, burns  删除换行 and crush-injuries with rhabdomyolysis are associated with hyperkalemia. \n\n【55】Severe hyperkalemia can cause serious ventricular arrhythmias. 172 Section 11 Typical ECG Abnormalities\n\n【56】Table 37.3: Management of hyperkalemia \n\n【57】•  Calcium gluconate injection\n\n【58】•  Glucose-insulin infusion\n\n【59】•  Nebulized salbutamol\n\n【60】•  Oral polystyrene resin\n\n【61】•  Hemodialysis\n\n【62】MANAGEMENT ISSUES \n\n【63】Since hyperkalemia can cause serious ventricular arrhythmias, the first priority  删除换行 is to protect the heart. Calcium gluconate has membrane stabilizing properties  删除换行 and is administered intravenously as 10 ml of 10% injection over 10 minutes. The  删除换行 next step is to drive potassium into the cells using 100 ml of 25% glucose with  删除换行 10 units of insulin given by an infusion. Nebulized salbutamol increases the  删除换行 urinary excretion of potassium by increasing the Na-K-ATPase pump activity. \n\n【64】Excess potassium in the body can be depleted by potassium-binding resin like  删除换行 polystyrene sulphonate administered orally. Finally, if severe hyperkalemia is  删除换行 associated with metabolic acidosis and fluid overload, hemodialysis is the answer \n\n【65】.

The greater vestibular glands, also known as \n\n【11】Bartholin’s glands, are situated at the base of the vestibular bulbs. They open out onto either  删除换行 side of the lower vagina at 5 and 7 o’clock positions and are important to provide lubrication  删除换行 during sexual intercourse. If a blockage occurs in either of the ducts, a tense cyst forms that  删除换行 commonly becomes infected due to their location forming an abscess. Bartholin’s abscesses  删除换行 are polymicrobial and often contain E. coli, Bacteriodes, Peptostreptococci and N. gonorrhoea. \n\n【12】Bartholin’s duct cysts are relatively common, mainly affecting women within their reproduc删除8：<u>￾</u>tive years, and are seen in 2% of women presenting to gynaecological services.\n\n【13】Clinical features include a unilateral swelling near the posterior aspect of the vulva. This will  删除换行 be very painful especially on movement or sitting and will be erythematous and tense. It is  删除换行 important to establish if it is fluctuant and therefore whether it can be drained. The patient  删除换行 may also have a low-grade fever.\n\n【14】Other causes of vulval swellings include Bartholin’s gland malignancy, vulval haematoma,  删除换行 mucous cyst of the vestibule, vulval fibroma, lipoma, sebaceous cyst and perianal abscess.\n\n【15】This is a clinical diagnosis and should be made based on history and examination. If the  删除换行 swelling is discharging fluid, a swab should be taken and sent to the laboratory for micros删除8：<u>￾</u>copy, culture and sensitivity. If the patient is pyrexial, blood tests including a full blood count, \n\n【16】C-reactive protein and blood cultures may also be taken.\n\n【17】The abscess must be drained surgically and the pus sent for culture, as well as giving anal删除8：<u>￾</u>gesia and a course of oral antibiotics. The most common method of drainage in the United \n\n【18】Kingdom is via marsupialisation of the cyst/abscess. This involves making an incision and  删除换行 clearing the loculations within the cyst. Part of the cyst wall is then excised, and the edges  删除换行 are sutured to the skin to allow continued drainage, and subsequent healing from the base. \n\n【19】The cavity may then be packed with ribbon gauze, which is removed within a few hours. \n\n【20】Patients are usually followed up 6 weeks post-operatively. Alternatively, a Word catheter can  删除换行 be inserted into the abscess for 3–4 weeks, allowing continual drainage and epithelialisation  删除换行 of the tract thereby forming a long-term outflow route for the gland.\n\n【21】It is important to note that the area is highly vascular and there can be significant blood loss. \n\n【22】Therefore, surgical intervention is usually reserved for a recurrent, large or multilocular cyst/\n\n【23】abscess. Small asymptomatic cysts (measuring less than 2 cm) do not require surgical drain删除8：<u>￾</u>age and can be treated conservatively with warm baths, compressors, analgesia and a course  删除换行 of antibiotics.\n\n【24】If the patient is systemically well, she does not need admission. Depending on the severity of  删除换行 the patient’s symptoms, it is possible to send patients away with a course of antibiotics and  删除换行 arrange for her to be brought back for an elective surgical procedure.

Become familiar with the management of common causes of lower extremity swelling.**\n\n【15】4\\. Define different types of lower extremity swelling and levels of lower extremity edema.\n\n【16】**Considerations**\n\n【17】**In older people， chronic venous insufficiency is the most common cause of bilat-eral lower extremity swelling， affecting up to 2% of the general population， with**\n\n【18】**increasing prevalence with age and obesity. Although venous insufficiency can often be diagnosed clinically without extensive testing， for persons older than 45 years there is an increased risk of pulmonary hypertension (most commonly secondary to obstructive sleep apnea) and congestive heart failure as the etiology of the lower extremity swelling. There are many medications also associated with fluid retention and should always be considered in the differential as a potential cause of or con-tributor to lower extremity swelling.**\n\n【19】**APPROACHTO：**\n\n【20】**Lower Extremity Edema**\n\n【21】**DEFINITIONS**\n\n【22】**VENOUS EDEMA： An excess of low viscosity， protein-poor interstitial fluid resulting in pitting in the affected area of the body.**\n\n【23】LYMPHEDEMA： An excess of protein-rich interstitial fluid within the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Primary forms are rare and often genetically related. Second-ary lymphedema is more common and often related to previous malignancies，sur-gery， radiation， and infections.\n\n【24】LIPIDEMA： A form of fat maldistribution that can appear to be leg swelling with foot sparing， and is not a true form of edema.\n\n【25】**MYXEDEMA： A dermal edema secondary to an increased deposition of connective tissue components (mucopolysaccharides) seen in various forms of thyroid disease.**\n\n【26】**CLINICAL APPROACH**\n\n【27】**Edema is defined as a visible and palpable swelling comprised of interstitial fluid. The most common cause of leg edema in North American patients older than50 years is venous insufficiency， as it affects up to 30% of the population. CHF affects around 1%of adults.The mostly likely cause of leg edema in women younger than 50 years is idiopathic edema， and may be confused with obesity. Most patients should be assumed to have one of these causes unless a history and physical indi-cate an underlying secondary cause. The two exceptions to this rule are in cases of pulmonary hypertension and undiagnosed CHF. These conditions may present with lower extremity edema prior to formal diagnosis.**\n\n【28】**History**\n\n【29】**The key elements of the history in evaluating the patient with lower extremity edema include the duration of edema (acute \\[≤72 hours\\]， vs chronic)， presence of pain， current medications， overnight improvement when sleeping (indicating dependent edema)， signs or symptoms of OSA (eg， snoring， daytime somnolence)， and history of chronic medical conditions including heart， liver， and kidney disease，**\n\n【30】**or past history of pelvic or abdominal malignancies or radiation therapy. Family history of clotting disorders， varicosities， and lymphedema are also important to document.**\n\n【31】**Physical Examination**\n\n【32】**The key elements of the physical examination in the patient with lower extrem-ity edema include signs of OSA including a body mass index (BMI) greater than30 kg/ m² and a thick neck circumference greater than 17 in (42 cm). Unilateral leg swelling is commonly seen with venous insufficiency， lymphedema， and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Bilateral leg swelling is commonly seen with bilateral venous insufficiency， medication side effects， and idiopathic or systemic causes. General-ized edema is seen in advanced systemic diseases including CHF， renal failure，and liver failure. Tenderness of the swelling can be seen with DVTs and lipedema. Pit-ting is commonly encountered with venous edema， DVT， CHF， and early lymph-edema； myxedema and chronic lymphedema do not cause pitting. Varicose veins are common in patients with chronic lymphedema， and a Kaposi-Stemmer sign(inability to pinch a fold of skin on dorsum of foot at base of second toe) is seen.**\n\n【33】**Common skin changes in lower extremity edema include hemosiderin depo-sition (brown pigmented spots)， dry dermatitis， and skin ulceration (in cases of venous insufficiency)， warm， tender， moist skin (as in complex regional pain syn-drome)， brawny induration， and warty texture with papillomatosis (lymphedema). Signs of underlying systemic disease include jaundice， ascites， and spider heman-gioma (in liver disease and cirrhosis) and jugular venous distention，hepatojugular reflex， and rales on pulmonary examination (in congestive heart failure).**\n\n【34】**Diagnostic Studies**\n\n【35】**The majority of patients older than 50 years who present with leg swelling have venous insufficiency. Pulmonary hypertension (due to OSA or other causes) should always be in the differential of likely venous insufficiency. If the etiology is unclear， a complete blood count (CBC)， comprehensive metabolic profile， urinalysis， and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) can potentially rule out common systemic diseases associated with leg swelling. Proteinuria and serum albumin less than 2 g/ dL are diagnostic for nephrotic syndrome. If the patient is found to have nephrotic syndrome， a fasting serum lipid profile should also be obtained.**\n\n【36】**If the clinical history and examination indicate a cardiac etiology， obtaining an electrocardiogram， echocardiogram， BNP， and chest radiograph should be obtained. A normal BNP can rule out CHF with a sensitivity of 90%.**\n\n【37】**In young women with idiopathic lower extremity edema who desire testing con-firmation， or if the etiology is unclear， a morning to evening weight gain of greater than 0.7 kg may confirm the diagnosis. A water load test can be performed by drinking 20 cc/kg (max 1500 cc) in the morning and collecting all urine 1 hour prior to consumption until 4 hours after， then repeating. In the first trial， the patient must stand for the 4-hour time frame. In the second trial， the patient must remain recumbent. In cases of idiopathic edema， less than 55% of water consumed will be voided in the standing position and greater than 65% will be voided in recumbent position. Idiopathic edema is often associated with obesity and with depression.**\n\n【38】Patients may complain of hand and face swelling in addition to leg swelling. On his-tory， many patients may be taking diuretics to self-treat， or may be present asking for\"water pills\"to decrease the edema.\n\n【39】**If a DVT is suspected (as in cases of acute edema)， a d-dimer level should be obtained. Due to its high sensitivity yet low specificity， a normal d-dimer level essentially rules out a DVT， yet a positive d-dimer is not diagnostic of DVT. Ifthe d-dimer is positive， then a venous Doppler ultrasonography of the lower extremi-ties should be obtained. In patients with intermediate-to-high pretest probability of DVT， negative ultrasonography alone is insufficient to exclude the diagnosis of DVT. Further assessment is recommended， including repeating ultrasonography in 1 week if the d-dimer is elevated. An echocardiogram should be considered in patients greater than 45 years to rule out pulmonary hypertension or in any patient in whom OSA is suspected， and a polysomnogram should be obtained to evaluate this condition. Ifliver disease is suspected， then liver function tests and coagulation studies should be obtained. If a malignancy is suspected， then an abdominal and pelvic examination and computed tomography (CT) scan should be considered. Tumors commonly associated with lower extremity edema include prostate cancer， ovarian cancer， and lymphoma.**\n\n【40】Idiopathic Edema\n\n【41】**Lifestyle modifications necessary to manage idiopathic edema include intermit-tent recumbency or leg elevation， avoidance of heat， low-sodium diet， decreased fluid intake， and weight loss. Patients with this disorder often have a secondary hyperaldosteronism due to this condition. Therefore， spironolactone dosed in the early evening has proven benefit in volume reduction. If not successful， a thiazide diuretic can be added as well. Loop diuretics should be avoided due to a higher risk of electrolyte abnormalities (eg， hypokalemia) and renal insufficiency. Compres-sion stockings are less successful with this condition. Diuretic abuse is common among patients with idiopathic edema， and can lead to a mild hypovolemia that can stimulate renin-angiotensin-aldosterone secretion， which can lead to rebound edema when the diuretic is stopped. Diuretic-induced rebound edema can be mini-mized by weaning off the diuretic over a 3- to 4-week period. Patients need to be reassured that the initial worsening of edema is common with the withdrawal of diuretics but should normalize.**\n\n【42】**Venous Insufficiency**\n\n【43】**For patients with venous insufficiency， nonpharmacologic therapies include com-pression leg stockings and leg elevation. Often higher compressions of 30 to 40 mm Hg at the ankle are required to adequately control the swelling. If arterial insuffi-ciency is a consideration， then venous and arterial Doppler ultrasonography should be performed prior to application of the stockings. Higher compression stockings can be difficult for some patients to put on， so patients should be instructed to put them on upon awakening before the leg swelling progresses. Advising the patient to roll the stockings off at the end of the day so that they can be rolled back on in the morning is also helpful. Stocking applicators can also be prescribed.**\n\n【44】**Horse chestnut seed extract inhibits elastin and hyaluronidase which in a300-mg twice-daily dosing has been shown to modestly decrease symptoms asso-ciated with venous insufficiency. Loop diuretics in low doses can be used short term for patients who are severely affected. Surgical inter ventions are available for patients with severe disease who are unresponsive to less-invasive measures.**\n\n【45】**Lymphedema**\n\n【46】**Patients with lymphedema should be educated regarding the chronic nature of the condition. Reasonable expectations for treatment must be set and understood， as this condition is often difficult to manage. Treatments include exercise， elevation， intermit-tent pneumatic compression devices， manual lymph drainage massage， and surgical procedures. Diuretics are typically not helpful， but may be commonly used for comor-bid conditions that contribute to volume overload including CHF and liver failure. Patients with chronic lymphedema are at a great risk of development of cellulitis. For patients with recurrent cellulitis， prophylactic antibiotics should be considered.**\n\n【47】Deep Vein Thrombosis\n\n【48】**Acute DVT requires prompt treatment with commencement of anticoagulation. Treatment options include low-molecular-weight heparin (eg， enoxaparin)， warfarin， and direct Xa inhibitors (eg，rivaroxaban). The therapeutic goal for war-farin therapy should be a target international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0 to3.0. The duration of anticoagulation therapy varies based on cause and recurrence rate of the DVT. In initial cases of uncomplicated DVT， 3 months of anticoagu-lation is warranted. In cases of recurrent DVT and/ or concomitant pulmonary embolism， then long-term anticoagulation is the standard of care. If anticoagula-tion therapy is contraindicated， then inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement may be indicated to prevent life-threatening pulmonary embolism.**\n\n【49】**CASE CORRELATION**\n\n【50】通用删除3(英):<u>**See also Case 27 (Congestive Heart Failure).**</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

His gait has gradually deteriorated because of unsteadiness. On examination the patient appears older than his stated age. His hair is nearly completely gray. There is slight limitation of head movement to either side, but no pain with neck extension. His tongue is red and depilated. His gait is broad based, and he is unable to walk a straight line. He is able to stand with his feet together with his eyes open, but he nearly falls when his eyes are closed. He has normal arm coordination but is ataxic on the heel–knee–shin maneuver. Deep tendon reflexes (DTRs) are 3+ in the arms, 3+ at the knees, and absent at the ankles. Both plantar responses are extensor. The patient has a jaw jerk and a positive snout reflex. There is a stocking decrease in sensation and a marked decrease in vibration and joint position sense in the toes and ankles. Cranial nerves are normal, and there are mild problems with memory and calculation. T2-weighted MRI of the brain demonstrates extensive areas of high-intensity signal in the periventricular white matter. MRI of the spine shows a hyperintense signal along the posterior column of the spinal cord.\n\n【3】 What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【4】 What is the next diagnostic step?\n\n【5】 What is the next step in therapy?\n\n【6】### ANSWERS TO CASE 22: Subacute Combined Degeneration of the Spinal Cord\n\n【7】_Summary_ : This is a 48-year-old patient who complains of a progressive gait disorder characterized by sensory ataxia caused by impaired position sense and spasticity. His examination is significant for both peripheral and central nervous system involvement, primarily affecting the white matter fibers of the posterior columns of the spinal columns and pyramidal tracts and large myelinated peripheral nerve affecting coordination and muscle tone.\n\n【8】• Most likely diagnosis : Vitamin B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> deficiency\n\n【9】• Next diagnostic step : Vitamin B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> level and if positive, subsequent testing to determine the source of B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> malabsorption\n\n【10】• Next step in therapy : Intramuscular vitamin B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> supplementation\n\n【11】#### ANALYSIS\n\n【12】##### _Objectives_\n\n【13】1\\. Understand the range of pathologic and clinical manifestations of vitamin B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> deficiency.\n\n【14】2\\. Know the differential diagnosis of vitamin B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> deficiency.\n\n【15】3\\. Understand the types of tests to confirm the diagnosis and etiology of vitamin B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> deficiency.\n\n【16】4\\. Be aware of the proper mode of repletion of vitamin B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> .\n\n【17】##### _Considerations_\n\n【18】The pertinent features of this case include the unsteadiness of gait, and numbness and stiffness. The physical examination helps localize the pathology. There is a stocking pattern decrease in sensation, specifically vibration and joint position sense, which strongly suggests a neuropathy involving large myelinated fibers. Involvement of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord, at or above the lumbar level is also a possibility. The pathologically increased reflexes in the arms along with the presence of primitive reflexes are “upper motor neuron signs” and suggest involvement of the corticospinal tract above the level of the cervical spinal cord. In this case, one would expect increased reflexes in the legs also, unless there is also a coexistent neuropathy. The ataxic heel–knee–shin maneuver also points to aberrant input to the cerebellum, which comes through large fibers. The mild problems on mental status examination indicate a cortical disorder. All of these findings suggest involvement at multiple levels of the nervous system. The imaging study confirms involvement of myelinated regions in the spinal cord, specifically the dorsal columns and in the brain. Assuming all these signs/symptoms are manifestations of a single entity, a systemic disease should be considered, such as HIV-1-associated vacuolar myelopathy, Lyme disease, multiple sclerosis, neurosyphilis, or vitamin B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> deficiency. Peripheral nerve disorders (neuropathic) would not be expected to give upper motor neuron signs. Another clue on physical diagnosis is the abnormal tongue and prematurely graying hair.\n\n【19】#### DEFINITIONS\n\n【20】BABINSKI SIGN/PRIMITIVE REFLEXES : Elicited reflex response present in newborns, which disappears with neurological development in association with progressive myelination of the nervous system. These “infantile” reflexes include the palmo-mental (contraction of ipsilateral chin mentalis muscle with stimulation of palm), snout (protrusion of lips with touching or tapping of lips), jaw jerk, and grasp reflex (closure of hand/fingers with placement of object in hand). The Babinski reflex is characterized by extensor response to the toe possibly in association with abduction of toes with stimulation of the sole or lateral side of the foot. It is present in infants and neonates and in association with disruption of the corticospinal tract of the brain and spinal cord.\n\n【21】NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES : An electrodiagnostic study of peripheral nerve function (nerve signal velocity and amplitude) often in conjunction with electromyography, which is used to assess muscle function or dysfunction.\n\n【22】### APPROACH TO: Subacute Combined Degeneration of the Spinal Cord\n\n【23】Spinal cord diseases are common, and many are treatable if discovered early. The spinal cord is a tubular structure originating from the medulla of the brain and extending through the bony spine to end at the level of the upper lumbar vertebrae. Ascending sensory and descending motor white matter tracts are located peripherally; posterior columns govern joint position, vibration and pressure, lateral spinothalamic tracts pain and temperature, and ventral corticospinal tracts carry motor signals.\n\n【24】#### VITAMIN B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> DEFICIENCY\n\n【25】Vitamin B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> deficiency usually presents as paresthesias in the hands and feet and loss of vibratory sense. There is a diffuse effect on the spinal cord, primarily the posterior lateral columns, explaining the early loss of vibratory sense. Late in the course, optic atrophy and mental changes as well as ataxia can occur. Macrocytic anemia is common.\n\n【26】Cyanocobalamin is a compound that is metabolized to a vitamin in the B complex commonly known as vitamin B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> . Vitamin B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> is the most chemically complex of all the vitamins. The structure of B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> is based on a corrin ring, which is similar to the porphyrin ring found in heme, chlorophyll, and cytochrome. The central metal ion is cobalt (Co). Once metabolized, cobalamin is a coenzyme in many biochemical reactions, including DNA synthesis, methionine synthesis from homocysteine, and conversion of propionyl into succinyl coenzyme A from methylmalonate. Dietary cobalamin (Cbl), obtained through animal foods, enters the stomach bound to animal proteins. Absorption requires many factors including stomach acid, R-protein, and intrinsic factor from gastric parietal cells, and the distal 80 cm of the ileum for transport. Interference in any of these points can lead to malabsorption of vitamin B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> . In addition, there are a number of inborn errors of metabolism that can both interfere with the absorption and action of vitamin B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> . The most common cause of vitamin B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> deficiency is malabsorption because of pernicious anemia, a condition where antibodies are generated to the parietal cells of the stomach, and the necessary binding proteins. There are many other causes, however, that should be considered.\n\n【27】Pathologically, in subacute combined degeneration (SCD), there is edema and destruction of myelin. Thus, the clinical presentation of SCD is caused by dorsal column, lateral corticospinal tract, and sometimes lateral spinothalamic tract dysfunction. The initial symptoms are usually paresthesia in the hands and feet. This condition can progress to sensory loss, gait ataxia, and distal weakness, particularly in the legs. If the disease goes untreated, an ataxic paraplegia can evolve. Specific findings on examination are loss of vibratory and joint position sense, weakness, spasticity, hyperreflexia, and extensor plantar responses. The syndrome of sensory loss as well as spastic paresis associated with pathologic lesions in the dorsal columns and lateral corticospinal tracts is referred to as _subacute combined degeneration_ . There are also effects on other body systems, most conspicuously hematologic with the macrocytic anemia.\n\n【28】#### DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\n\n【29】The manifestations of vitamin B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> deficiency are noted in Table 22–1 . The differential diagnosis for progressive spastic paraplegia includes degenerative causes, demyelinating, infectious, inflammatory, neoplastic, nutritional, and vascular disorders (HIV-1-associated vacuolar myelopathy, Lyme disease, multiple sclerosis neurosyphilis, toxic neuropathy, Friedreich ataxia, and vitamin E deficiency). The differential diagnosis of SCD is broad, but vitamin B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> deficiency should be considered in any patient with progressive sensory symptoms or weakness.\n删除4：<u>Table 22–1 • CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS OF VITAMIN B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> DEFICIENCY</u>\n\n【30】#### LABORATORY CONFIRMATION\n\n【31】Testing for vitamin B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> deficiency includes a direct assay of the vitamin as well as looking at the indirect effect of abnormal reactions resulting in altered metabolite levels. The definitions of Cbl (vitamin B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> ) deficiency are as follows: Serum Cbl level <150 pmol/L on two separate occasions OR serum Cbl level < 150 pmol/L AND total serum homocysteine level >13 µmol/L OR methylmalonic acid (MMA) > 0.4 µmol/L (in the absence of renal failure and folate and vitamin B <sub class=\"calibre12\">6 </sub> deficiencies). The hemato-logic manifestations of vitamin B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> deficiency can be mimicked by folate deficiency, but this does not mimic the neurologic manifestations. High MMA levels and normal B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> levels indicate a functional deficiency likely due to abnormal cofactors needed for B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> action. In addition, the multiple organ systems and subsystems affected are highly variable from patient to patient.\n\n【32】Confirmatory effects of the anatomic and physiologic consequences of B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> deficiency involve nerve conduction studies and MRI. Few reported cases of MR imaging of SCD exist. Findings in these cases include modest expansion of the cervical and thoracic spinal cord and increased signal intensity on T2-weighted images, primarily in the dorsal columns and lateral pyramidal tracts.\n\n【33】#### TREATMENT\n\n【34】Treatment of vitamin B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> deficiency involves administering the vitamin in a fashion to bypass the pathologic steps in the transport process. This usually involves intramuscular administration of the vitamin, first to build up stores and then on a monthly basis. Specifically, 1000 µg/d for 1 week, then 1000 µg/wk for 1 month. Then 1000 µg/mo until the cause of deficiency is corrected, or for life in the case of pernicious anemia. This is effective for all forms of the deficiency. There are also methods of oral administration that are sometimes effective. Treatment can reverse or stop most if not all of the sequelae of vitamin B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> deficiency.\n\n【35】####", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

This patient presents with subacute combined degeneration, a neurologic condition associated with vitamin B12 deficiency that leads to abnormal myelin. Vitamin B12 deficiency causes macrocytic, megaloblastic anemia (mean corpuscular volume >100 £L) with hypersegmented neutrophils on blood smear. This patient likely has an isolated vitamin B12 deficiency secondary to surgical resection of the terminal ileum. When vitamin B12 is ingested, it combines with intrinsic factor secreted by the parietal cells in the stomach. This complex is then absorbed in the terminal ileum. It is likely that she avoided this deficiency for some time due to the large pool of vitamin B12 stored in the liver. Folate deficiency also presents with a macrocytic, megaloblastic anemia with hypersegmented neutrophils. However, it is not associated with neurologic problems. In this patient, folate levels would be expected to be normal, inasmuch as loss of the terminal ileum does not affect the intestinal absorption of folate, and this patient has been eating a normal diet, which should provide adequate folate levels.  \n\n【7】Answer A is incorrect . These laboratory values are consistent with a microcytic anemia (ie, iron deficiency, thalassemia, or lead poisoning). Microcytic anemias are not associated with subacute combined degeneration. They can present with fatigue and pallor, and are most often due to some form of blood loss.  \n\n【8】Answer B is incorrect . These laboratory values could be from a healthy patient or from someone with a normocytic anemia such as anemia of chronic disease, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, or anemia following an acute hemorrhage.  \n\n【9】Answer C is incorrect . These laboratory values are consistent with folate deficiency. Folate deficiency is not associated with the neurologic symptoms observed in this patient, and this patient appears to be receiving adequate amounts of folate in her diet. Folate deficiency is most often seen with chronic alcohol use and malnutrition.  \n\n【10】Answer D is incorrect . These laboratory values are consistent with a macrocytic, nonmegaloblastic anemia, which can result secondarily to liver disease, hypothyroidism, or drugs that impair DNA synthesis.

A higher score is associated with poorer preexisting neurological function， and a higher surgical risk. In addition， myocardial stress is a common occurrence after a subarachnoid bleed. Patients with preexisting heart disease need cardiac evaluation， if time permits. Remarkable ECG changes， particularly with the ST segments， occur in most patients following an intracranial bleed. These changes are associated with life-threatening arrhythmias， and a poor outcome.

The sudden， massive blood loss hinders the surgeon’s ability to visualize and control the bleeding. While the overall goal is to maintain a normal blood pressure to ensure optimal collateral circulation， the rapid induction of hypotension， even to a pressure of 40 to 50 mm Hg for a short period， improves surgical visualization and can be lifesaving. A brief， manual compression of the ipsilateral carotid artery may also be helpful for this purpose. Blood transfusions may be needed to replace acute surgical blood loss.\n\n【12】\\> Implications of cerebral vasospasm： This is a major complication fol-lowing aneurysm rupture. It usually occurs 5 to 9 days post hemorrhage. Hypotension should be avoided at this stage， since in the face of vasospasm， hypotension can be associated with reduced cerebral perfu-sion and a resultant neurologic deficit.

Know the management of intraoperative aneurysm rupture and of cerebral vasospasm.\n\n【19】**Considerations**\n\n【20】The preoperative evaluation of this 50-year-old patient should include an examination of the airway， the patient’s mental status， and presence of any focal neurologic deficit. This patient has history of systemic hypertension， so a thorough cardiac evaluation is essential. A stress echocardiogram with radionuclide imaging provides a guide to whether the patient's myocardial blood supply is adequate to tolerate induced hypotension which is often required for aneurysm clipping. Assessment should include laboratory tests including complete blood count， coagulation profile， chemistry panel， and an electrocardiogram. The patient should be cross-matched for at least two units of packed red cells.\n\n【21】Anesthetic plan and technique： This patient has presented for elective clipping of an intracranial aneurysm which has not yet bled. Her symptoms are headache and nuchal rigidity， with no focal neurological or cranial nerve involvement. She falls under grade 1 in Hess and Hunt scale， and has a good prognosis from surgical clipping.\n\n【22】Preoperative preparation includes placement of two large-bore intravenous cannulae and an arterial line for blood pressure monitoring. The arterial transducer is positioned at the level of her external auditory canal to precisely report the arterial pressure in the head (as opposed to placing the transducers at the height of the heart， to measures pressures at heart level). This patient does not require a central venous line for this procedure.\n\n【23】A vasodilator or vasodilators are prepared and ready for administration prior to induction， and can profoundly affect blood pressure. Nicardipine， sodium nitroprusside (nitroprusside)， and nitroglycerin are most commonly used. These drugs should also be prepared for administration as a bolus prior to starting the infusion.\n\n【24】The induction of anesthesia is carefully begun using sodium thiopental or propofol. Intubating doses of a nondepolarizer are used for muscle relaxation. Lidocaine， administered intravenously or locally to the trachea， as well as an 删除换行 opiate and/or esmolol attenuate any sudden elevations in bloodpressure from laryngoscopy， intubation， or the application of surgical pins to the skull.\n\n【25】Anesthesia is maintained with a combination of oxygen and air， and an inhalational anesthetic. Muscle paralysis is monitored closely with a twitch monitor to prevent a patient’s coughing or “bucking”while in head pins. A normal Paco， is maintained until the dura is opened， to prevent any sudden reductions in intracranial pressure. Vasodilators are administered as necessary to control any elevations in blood pressure that occur.\n\n【26】Mild hypotension， such as a mean arterial pressure around 60 mm of Hg， is usually desirable to shrink the size of the aneurysm and reduce its translumi-nal pressures. This， in turn， improves surgical visualization and the ease with which the aneurysm can be manipulated. Mild hypotension is accomplished by increasing the level of the anesthetic and using a nicardipine infusion.\n\n【27】During emergence from anesthesia， surges in blood pressure， elevations in intracranial pressure， and coughing must be avoided. Remifentanil， an opiate， and lidocaine may suppress the cough reflex during emergence. A vasodilator infusion and/or esmolol provide strict blood pressure control and avoidance of tachycardia.\n\n【28】**APPROACH TO**\n\n【29】**Anesthesia for Intracranial Aneurysm**\n\n【30】**DEFINITIONS**\n\n【31】MEAN ARTERIAL PRESSURE = Diastolic pressure + 1/3 pulse pressure PULSE PRESSURE = Systolic pressure - Diastolic pressure\n\n【32】HUNT AND HESS CLASSIFICATION OF ANEURYSM： A grading scale of1 to 5 which correlates patient symptoms on presentation with outcome .\n\n【33】TRANSMURAL ANEURISMAL PRESSURE：The pressure differential between the interior of the aneurismal sac and the intracranial pressure.\n\n【34】TRIPLE THERAPY FOR VASOSPASM： Forced hypertension， hemodilution， and hypervolemia to overcome vasospasm and preserve cerebral perfusion.\n\n【35】**CLINICAL APPROACH**\n\n【36】The incidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage is approximately 7 per 100，000， accounting for almost 10% of all cerebrovascular accidents. Sixteen percent of patients die within minutes of a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Of the patients who survive to be admitted to the hospital， 25% will die following admission.\n\n| Table 30-1 HUNT AND HESS CLASSIFICATION  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Grade 1  | Asymptomatic or minimal headache with slight nuchal rigidity  |\n| Grade 2  | Moderate to severe headache，nuchal rigidity， no neurologic deficit otherthan cranial nerve palsy  |\n| Grade 3  | Drowsiness，confusion， or mild focal deficit  |\n| Grade 4  | Stupor， moderate to severe hemiparesis， possibly early decerebraterigidity， and vegetative disturbances  |\n| Grade 5  | Deep coma， decerebrate rigidity， moribund appearance  |\n\n【38】Left untreated， 50% of aneurysms will re-rupture within 6 months. The inci-dence of aneurismal rupture during the induction of anesthesia is between0.5% and 6%， and carries a mortality of 75%. Only about 50% of patients recover fully. The anesthetic management of unruptured _1_ intracranial aneurysm is presented in Table 30-2\n\n【39】The surgery for an intracranial aneurysm may be scheduled as an elective procedure， or as an emergency， following a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The goals of the anesthetic for intracranialaneurismal surgery are： to carefully control：systemic bloodFpressure to minimize the risk of intraoperative aneurysm rupture， to provide optimal operating conditions， and to control intracranial pressure. The risk of re-bleeding is highest between day 1 and day 4. Thus strict blood pressure control is imperative to prevent a re-bleed， especially during this period.\n\n【40】Before the dura is opened， any reductions in ICP can actually increase the aneurysm's transmural pressures， thus increasing the risk of rupture. For this reason， the Paco， is maintained at a normal level. Once the dura is opened，\n\n【41】**Table 30-2 ANESTHETIC MANAGEMENT FOR AN UNRUPTURED INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSM**\n\n【42】·Assignment of Hunt and Hess grading of neurological status.\n\n【43】·Evaluation of comorbidities (emphasis on whether patient can tolerate deliberate hypotension，volume loading).\n\n【44】·Two large-bore i.v.access；central line/PA catheter if necessary.\n\n【45】**·Arterial line.**\n\n【46】· Strict control of blood pressure， possibly including deliberate hypotension .\n\n【47】·Risk of hypertension is highest during laryngoscopy and intubation， placement of surgical pins，craniotomy and manipulation of dura， and during emergence.\n\n【48】·Patient should be monitored in an intensive care setting in the postoperative period.\n\n【49】mild hyperventilation may be useful to improve operating conditions. Manipulation of the dura is quite painful， and can suddenly increase blood pressure， particularly in the face of light anesthesia. Anticipation of this event can minimize any changes.\n\n【50】The risk of vasospasm is highest between days 5 and 9. The treatment for vasospasm is forced hypertension， hemodilution， and hypervolemia， also known as triple therapy， and used to relieve vasospasm and preserve cerebral perfusion. Infusions of phenylephrine or norepinephrine are typically used to elevate blood pressure. Nimodipine， a calcium channel blocker which causes cerebral vasodilatation， is also be added to this regimen.\n\n【51】After hemorrhage， any blood remaining in the cisterns can contribute to the development of obstructive hydrocephalus. This may require the place-ment of a temporary ventricular drain or a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt.\n\n【52】**Deliberate Hypotension**\n\n【53】Deliberate or induced hypotension is useful in minimizing blood loss espe-cially in orthopedic and neurological procedures. In patients with no systemic disease (including hypertension)， a MAP of 50 mm of Hg can be tolerated without adverse effects. For the elderly and patients with coexisting systemic disease even in the absence of obvious end-organ damage， it is probably more appropriate to maintain MAP at 60 mm Hg or above. In patients with end-organ involvement such myocardial ischemia， impaired kidney function or those with diabetes， deliberate hypotension is relatively contraindicated. If absolutely required for the aneurysm surgery， it should be utilized cautiously and only for intermittent short periods.\n\n【54】The medications used for deliberate hypotension for intracranial aneurysm surgery， particularly when near the aneurysm， include：\n\n【55】Nicardipine， a calcium channel blocker which can be used as an infusion or as a bolus. Nicardipine dilates arteries and veins， and is not typically associ-ated with as potent reflex tachycardia than some of the other infusions.\n\n【56】Nitroglycerine， a potent venodilator， reduces blood pressure by reducing venous return. It has a rapid onset and rapid offset. But as with any venodila-tor， nitroglycerine increases intracranial pressure. It also causes reflex tachy-cardia which can be treated with beta blockers. Nitroglycerine causes cerebral venodilation and increases in ICP. It is best used after the dura is opened and should be avoided in patients with poor intracranial compliance.\n\n【57】Sodium nitroprusside is an arterial and venodilator， which also increases intracranial pressure. Nitroprusside breaks down and releases nitric oxide which activates guanylate cyclase. This increases the concentration of cyclic guanosine monophosphate which causes smooth muscle relaxation. It has a rapid onset and rapid offset. It reduces blood pressure by reducing afterload. A major side effect is cyanide toxicity. The treatment of cyanide toxicity includes 删除换行 cessation of the SNP infusion and specific antidotes such as inhalation of amyl nitrate， sodium nitrate 5 mg/kg i.v.， or sodium thiosulfate 150 mg/kg.\n\n【58】If nitroprusside is chosen as the vasodilator， it’s worth noting that the sudden cessation of nitroprusside infusion can cause rebound hypertension， so nitro-prusside needs to be weaned off gradually. Nitroprusside has five cyanide mol-ecules and cyanide toxicity can occur if doses exceed > 7 mg/min. The signs of toxicity include increasing tolerance and metabolic acidosis.\n\n【59】Hydralazine， a direct acting vasodilator， acts independently of the adrenergic or cholinergic receptors. The peak effect is in 15 to 20 minutes and the half-life is up to 4 hours. Hydralazine causes reflex tachycardia.\n\n【60】Labetalol， a mixed alpha- and beta-receptor antagonist. The ratio of beta to alpha receptor blockade is 3：1 with oral administration and 7：1 with intra-venous administration. Labetalol decreases the peripheral vascular resistance and reduces mean arterialrpressure. It does not cause reflex tachycardia and has no effect on intracranial pressure.\n\n【61】Esmolol， a selective beta-1-adrenergic-receptor antagonist. Esmolol is rapidly metabolized by red cell esterases. It has a rapid onset， peak effect in 5 minutes， and a short duration of action. The half-life is 9 minutes. It is invaluable in the perioperative period due to its rapid onset and offset. It can be used even in patients with reactive airway disease.\n\n【62】The complications of deliberate hypotension include： myocardial ischemia， cerebral ischemia， oliguria and/or renal failure， metabolic acidosis， rebound hypertension， visual impairment (especially in the prone position and in dia-betics). Deliberate hypotension is contraindicated in patients with preexisting coronary/cerebral or renal vascular insufficiencies， hypovolemia， and anemia.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

He presents to his physician after noting blood in his urine. Physical examination is significant for scleral icterus, and urinalysis shows hemoglobinuria. A peripheral blood smear shows spherocytes, bite cells, and Heinz bodies. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【1】> (A) Alkaptonuria\n\n【2】> (B) Cystinuria\n\n【3】> (C) Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency\n\n【4】> (D) Hereditary fructose intolerance\n\n【5】> (E) Hereditary spherocytosis\n\n【6】> (F) Lactase deficiency\n\n【7】 **Answer**: The correct answer is C. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is characterized by acute episodes of hemolytic anemia following administration of certain medications, infection, or ingestion of fava beans. G6PD is the first and rate-limiting enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway, which produces two reducing equivalents that keep glutathione in its reduced state. Reduced glutathione is necessary to detoxify peroxides and free radicals that can accumulate within RBCs and cause damage to various cellular structures. Heinz bodies are small round inclusions seen within RBCs that comprise hemoglobin and other protein precipitates. G6PD deficiency is most common in people who are black, people of Mediterranean descent, and people from tropical Africa and Asia.  \n\n【8】Answer A is incorrect. Alkaptonuria is a rare genetic disorder in which patients present with urine that darkens on exposure to air. These patients cannot breakdown the amino acid tyrosine, which results in the accumulation of a by-product called homogentisic acid. Homogentisic acid builds up in the skin and connective tissues and is excreted in the urine, causing the dark color. Patients typically have a good prognosis, although many suffer from arthritis as well as heart disease and kidney/prostate stones.  \n\n【9】Answer B is incorrect. Cystinuria is caused by a defect in an amino acid transporter in the renal tubules. This is an inherited defect that affects the absorption of four amino acids: cystine, ornithine, lysine, and arginine. Cystine kidney stones can form as a result of excess cystine in the urine. This disorder is not associated with the jaundice or hematologic abnormalities seen in this patient.  \n\n【10】Answer D is incorrect. Hereditary fructose intolerance is an autosomal-recessive inherited disease due to a deficiency of aldolase B, which causes an accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate. The decrease in available phosphate leads to inhibition of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. Patients present with jaundice, cirrhosis, hypoglycemia, and scleral icterus. Hepatosplenomegaly is often seen on physical examination. It is usually diagnosed in early childhood, when children are weaned from formula to regular table food.  \n\n【11】Answer E is incorrect. Hereditary spherocyto-sis is caused by a variety of molecular defects in genes that code for spectrin, ankyrin, protein 4.1, and other RBC membrane proteins. The structural defect makes the RBCs more fragile and they take on a spherical shape, hence the name “spherocytes.” Spherocytes are recognized as abnormal and destroyed in the spleen, resulting in severe anemia and splenomegaly. Splenectomy curbs the anemia; however, the RBCs will continue to be spherical in shape.  \n\n【12】Answer F is incorrect. Lactase deficiency can be due to either an inherited intolerance or an age-dependent acquired intolerance of the sugar lactose. Acquired lactase deficiency (decreased expression with increased age) is more common in Africans and Asians.

The stiffness is most prominent on awakening  删除换行 and lasts approximately an hour before getting better through the day. She denies any other  删除换行 musculoskeletal problems or any other joints being affected. Her only medical history is mild  删除换行 asthma. Her family history is positive for type 1 diabetes in her brother.\n\n【3】Examination\n\n【4】Physical examination reveals a well-looking, slim woman. Her metacarpophalangeal joints  删除换行 are slightly swollen bilaterally and mildly tender, and there is some pain on palpation over a  删除换行 few of the interphalangeal joints in both hands.

Based on the history and examination findings, suggest a differential diagnosis. \n\n【7】Which diagnosis is most likely and why?\n\n【8】2. What further investigations are required, and which tests are most predictive for the  删除换行 likely diagnosis?\n\n【9】3. Summarize the pathophysiology of the underlying diagnosis. What extra-articular  删除换行 complications may arise with this condition?删除7：<u>100 Cases in Clinical Pathology</u>\n删除5：<u>44</u>\nANSWER 14\n\n【10】The clinical picture in this case is very suggestive of an inflammatory arthropathy with the  删除换行 findings of joint swelling, morning stiffness and evidence of synovitis. The key differential  删除换行 diagnoses therefore include:\n\n【11】• Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)\n\n【12】• Seronegative spondyloarthropathies (e.g. psoriatic arthritis, arthritis associated  删除换行 with inflammatory bowel disease)\n\n【13】• Post-viral or post-infectious arthropathy\n\n【14】• Connective tissue diseases (such as lupus and scleroderma)\n\n【15】• Crystal arthropathy (gout and pseudogout)\n\n【16】• Degenerative joint disease (osteoarthritis)\n\n【17】The most likely diagnosis is rheumatoid arthritis, which is the commonest inflammatory  删除换行 arthropathy and typically affects adults between the ages of 30 and 50. This is because the  删除换行 history of bilateral joint problems, mainly in the small joints of the hand, as well as morning  删除换行 stiffness lasting greater than one hour, is very suggestive of an inflammatory, rather than  删除换行 a degenerative process (in the latter, symptoms tend to get worse throughout the day and  删除换行 stiffness generally lasts less than an hour). Similarly, the absence of any background medical  删除换行 history or other symptoms makes seronegative arthritis, postviral arthritis and connective  删除换行 tissue disease unlikely.\n\n【18】The diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, according to the American College of Rheumatology,  删除换行 requires four of the following to be present (the first four for at least 6 weeks)删除5：<u>:</u>\n• Morning stiffness lasting >1 hour\n\n【19】• Symmetric arthritis\n\n【20】• Arthritis of three or more joint areas\n\n【21】• Hand joint involvement\n\n【22】• Rheumatoid nodules\n\n【23】• Rheumatoid factor seropositivity\n\n【24】• Typical radiographic features (e.g. erosions, juxta-articular osteopenia)\n\n【25】This patient meets three criteria from history and examination alone, and referral to a rheu删除8：<u>￾</u>matology specialist would be warranted. Further investigations would include basic blood  删除换行 tests (full blood count – possible anaemia of chronic disease, renal and hepatic function – \n\n【26】which may guide medication choice) and tests of inflammatory activity. The latter include \n\n【27】CRP and ESR along with more specific tests for RA, namely rheumatoid factor (RF) and  删除换行 anti-CCP antibodies. Anti-CCP has a similar sensitivity (65–85%) but much higher specific删除8：<u>￾</u>ity (>95% vs. 80%) for RA in patients with suspected rheumatic disease than RF, and anti删除8：<u>￾</u>CCP positivity is also associated with a more severe clinical course. Radiographs of the hand  删除换行 would also be useful to look for evidence of joint damage.\n\n【28】The pathophysiology of RA is incompletely understood and the cause remains unknown. It is  删除换行 an autoimmune disease triggered by the exposure of a genetically susceptible individual to an  删除换行 as-yet unidentified antigen. Interplay of genetic (e.g. human leukocyte antigen [HLA]-DR4  删除换行 allele) and environmental (e.g. smoking, infection) factors lead to altered post-transcriptional  删除换行 regulation of proteins and citrullination of self-proteins. Loss of tolerance to these new epi删除8：<u>￾</u>topes leads to the formation of autoantibodies (e.g. anti-CCP) and the stimulation of B- and \n\n【29】CD4 T-cell responses, which act against unknown target antigens in joints and mediate joint  删除换行 injury via production of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1. These stimulate Case 14: Stiff and painful hands\n\n【30】删除5：<u>45</u>\nproliferation of synovial cells and the production of matrix metalloproteinases, which assist  删除换行 in destruction of articular cartilage, and the inflammatory-rich hyperplastic synovium  删除换行 adheres and grows over the articular surfaces forming pannus.\n\n【31】RA is also associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, resulting from endo删除8：<u>￾</u>thelial activation by inflammatory cytokines. This generalized inflammatory response may  删除换行 also account for the other systemic manifests of RA, involving the lungs (fibrosis), bones \n\n【32】(osteoporosis) and brain (reduced cognition), as well as a higher risk of lymphoma.\n\n【33】KEY POINTS\n\n【34】• Morning stiffness is a common rheumatologic symptom, and the key to distin删除8：<u>￾</u>guishing whether it is inflammatory or degenerative in origin is seeing whether it  删除换行 gets better or worse through the day.\n\n【35】• Rheumatoid arthritis typically affects the small joints of the hands bilaterally, and  删除换行 is associated with positivity for anti-CCP antibodies.\n\n【36】• It is believed to arise from the immune system reacting against as-yet unidenti删除8：<u>￾</u>fied antigens, provoking the formation of an inflammatory pannus over articular  删除换行 surfaces.Case 15: Abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting\n\n【37】删除5：<u>47</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The most common initial sensory impairment in patients with diabetes is a loss of vibrational sensation. This finding is most clearly demonstrated on physical examination by placing a vibrating tuning fork on the big toe. The sensory receptors responsible for transducing the sensation of vibration, pressure, and tension are the large, encapsulated pacinian corpuscles, which are located in the deeper layers of the skin, ligaments, and joint capsules. They can be distinguished histologically by their onion-like appearance on cross section. This patient is presenting with one of the complications of diabetes, neuropathy, and because pacinian corpuscles are responsible for transducing vibratory stimuli, it is these receptors that are involved in this patient’s presentation.  \n\n【7】Answer A is incorrect . Krause end bulbs are sensory receptors found in the oropharynx and conjunctiva of the eye.  \n\n【8】Answer B is incorrect . Meissner corpuscles, which are responsible for conveying the sensation of light touch, are small and encapsulated sensory receptors found just beneath the dermis of hairless skin, most prominently in the fingertips, soles of the feet, and lips. Meissner corpuscles are involved in the reception of light discriminatory touch, not vibratory sensation, as is being tested in this case.  \n\n【9】Answer C is incorrect . Merkel nerve endings are non-encapsulated and found in all skin types (both hairy and hairless) and, along with Meissner corpuscles, are believed to be responsible for discriminatory touch.  \n\n【10】Answer E is incorrect .

However, the examination findings and investigations reduce  删除换行 the number of possibilities significantly. The investigations reveal a normocytic anaemia  删除换行 with an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), possibly suggesting haemolytic anaemia,  删除换行 with a borderline thrombocytopenia and positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) test, against  删除换行 the background of normal thyroid, renal and liver function. ANA positivity is not specific  删除换行 for any particular autoimmune disease but does raise this possibility. In this case, ANA posi删除8：<u>￾</u>tivity points towards a differential of autoimmune or connective tissue disorders, including  删除换行 systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis, mixed connective  删除换行 tissue disease, Sjögren’s syndrome and inflammatory myopathies such as dermatomyositis  删除换行 and polymyositis. \n\n【28】This patient meets the 2019 European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology/American \n\n【29】College of Rheumatology (EULAR/ACR) classification criteria for the diagnosis of SLE, as  删除换行 she has a positive ANA along with 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> arthritis, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> neurologic symptoms and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> haemolytic  删除换行 anaemia. While SLE can be putatively diagnosed with these conditions, further investiga删除8：<u>￾</u>tions would be useful in confirming this. In particular, specific autoantibodies for SLE (e.g.  删除换行 anti-dsDNA and anti-SmAg) would be helpful in making the diagnosis. Given the history of  删除换行 a miscarriage, antiphospholipid antibodies could be tested to exclude lupus anticoagulant  删除换行 syndrome. \n\n【30】The pathogenesis of SLE is not well understood, with genetic, environmental, hormonal and  删除换行 immunoregulatory factors all playing a part in the ultimate breakdown of self-tolerance,  删除换行 which leads to organ injury. One theory is that a defect in clearance of apoptotic or necrotic  删除换行 cells leads to the sensitisation of T and B cells to intracellular antigens, triggering the autoim删除8：<u>￾</u>mune process. For example, deficiencies of early complement components (C1q, C4), which  删除换行 are important for these clearance processes, produce an SLE-like syndrome.

This patient’s clinical description is consistent with AIDS, and his symptoms are consistent with AIDS complex dementia (ADC). Symptoms of ADC include slowed cognition, depressed mood, ataxia, seizures, and urinary and bowel incontinence later in the course of the disease. Symptoms result from HIV-induced demyelination of neurons in the central nervous system. The patient’s recent weight loss supports the diagnosis of HIV infection, and purplish skin lesions are consistent with Kaposi sarcoma, a cancer that predominantly affects patients with AIDS.  \n\n【7】Answer B is incorrect . High fever, rigidity of the neck, and encapsulated yeasts in CSF are characteristic of meningitis caused by _Cryptococcus neoformans_ . Although patients with AIDS are at higher risk for developing cryptococcal meningitis, the patient’s current presentation does not suggest this etiology.  \n\n【8】Answer C is incorrect . Involuntary, dance-like movements of the extremities is descriptive of the chorea of Huntington disease, an autosomal dominant disorder that involves dementia, psychosis, and gross motor dysfunction, progressing to death. CT scan or autopsy often reveals gross cortical atrophy.  \n\n【9】Answer D is incorrect . Paralysis and atrophy of the extremities is characteristic of infection with poliovirus.  \n\n【10】Answer E is incorrect .

This should be treated immediately with high doses of corticosteroids， orbital irradiation and plasma exchange as an adjunct. If there is no improvement within 72-96 h， orbital nerve decompression by surgical removal of the floor and medial wall of the orbit is necessary.\n\n【63】Moderate ophthalmopathy. This improves substantially in 2-3 years in most patients. In the interim the patient is treated symptomatically：\n\n【64】· Pain and grittiness is treated with methylcellulose eye drops by day and a lubricating eye ointment at night\n\n【65】●Exposure keratitis may be relieved by lateral tarsorraphy， surgery of the lower eyelid\n\n【66】Diplopia may be relieved by prisms (the Fresnel prism is stuck on to the lens of spectacle) or surgery of the extraocular muscles\n\n【67】Static or worsening ophthalmopathy is an indication for steroids， orbital decompression or orbital irradiation\n\n【68】· Patients should be advised to stop smoking.\n\n【69】Mild ophthalmopathy. This can be rectified by cosmetic eyelid surgery. It is important to remember that patients can be distressed by their appear-ance. During the early acute phase， patients will have considerable symptomatic relief from the following measures：\n\n【70】Elevating the head at night\n\n【71】**Diuretics to reduce oedema**\n\n【72】Tinted glasses for protection from the sun， wind and foreign bodies.\n\n【73】Note： Rituximab has been used successfully in a small number of patients with moderate-to-severe steroid-resistant Graves'ophthalmopathy.\n\n【74】**What is the role of radioiodine in thyroid eye disease?**\n\n【75】●Since radioiodine treatment carries a substantial risk of exacerbating pre-existing thyroid eye disease， it should be avoided as far as possible in patients with active or severe ophthalmopathy， in whom medical therapy with a thionamide drug such as carbimazole is preferable. Radioiodine may be used in patientswith mild eye disease but adjuvant oral corticosteriods should be prescribed(N Engl J Med1998；338：73-8).\n\n【76】· Patients without clinical evidence of thyroid disease have a small risk of developing ophthalmopathy and a very low risk of developing severe eye disease. It is prudent to warn all patients of this complication， but the risks do not justify denying most patients the benefits of definitive treatment with radioiodine when indicated. In addition， the risks do not justify the routine use of corticosteroids in patients without ophthal-mopathy (BMJ 1999；319：68-9).\n\n【77】●Smoking， raised serum Ts and uncorrected hypothyroidism are also factors that can exacerbate thyroid eye disease. Therefore， to reduce the risk of thyroid eye disease， patients should be encouraged to stop smoking， be rendered euthyroid with a thionamide before radioiodine， and be monitored closely to detect and treat early hypothyroidism or persistent hyperthyroidism.\n\n【78】**Mention the less important eponyms related to thyroid eye disease**\n\n【79】● Infrequent blinking： Stellwag's sign\n\n【80】●Tremor of closed eyelids： Rosenbach's sign\n\n【81】· Difficulty in everting upper eyelid： Gifford’s sign\n\n【82】● Absence of wrinkling of forehead on sudden upward gaze： Joffroy's sign\n\n【83】Impaired convergence of the eyes： Mobius’ sign\n\n【84】Weakness of at least one of the extraocular muscles： Ballet’s sign\n\n【85】· Paralysis of extraocular muscles： Jendrassik’s sign\n\n【86】● Poor fixation on lateral gaze： Suker’s sign\n\n【87】· Dilatation of pupil with weak epinephrine solution： Loewi’s sign\n\n【88】Jerky pupillary contraction to consensual light： Cowen's sign\n\n【89】Increased pigmentation of the margins of eyelids： Jellinek's sign\n\n【90】Upper lid resistance on downward traction： Grove's sign\n\n【91】Abnormal fullness of the eyelid： Enroth's sign\n\n【92】·Unequal pupillary dilatation： Knie's sign\n\n【93】·When the eyeball is turned downwards， there is arrest of the descent of the lid， spasm and continued descent： Boston’s sign\n\n【94】·When the clinician places his or her hand on a level with the patient’s eyes and then lifts it higher， the patient's upper lids spring up more quickly than the eyeball： Kocher’s sign.\n\n【95】J Dalrymple 通用删除7(英):<u>(1804-1852)</u>， an English ophthalmologist.\n\n【96】Exophthalmos associated with goitre and non-organic heart disease was first described by the English physician Caleb Hillard Parry 通用删除7(英):<u>(1775-1822)</u> in a paper published posthumously in 1825.

The discoloration began on her chest and slowly progressed to her arms and upper back. She has tried over the counter fade creams without success. There is minimal pruritus. She notes some improvement when she goes on vacation at the beach. She has no other associated systemic symptoms.\n\n【11】Physical Examination\n--------------------\n\n【12】The chest, anterior neck, upper back, and antecubital fossa have numerous 0.5–3 cm slate gray to bluish brown oval, annular coalescing patches. The lesions are nontender, and there is no associated scale .\n删除3：<u>Figure 15.1\n\n【13】Erythema dyschromicum perstans. Ash-like, slate gray to blue, oval macules and patches are noted on the chest ( a ) and antecubital fossa </u>( b )\n\n【14】Differential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【15】The differential diagnosis of this disorder is broad. The most frequent cause of confusion and controversy is with lichen planus pigmentosus, which is characterized by hyperpigmented dark-brown macules with no active border and a noncharacteristic distribution that predominates in sun exposed areas and flexor folds. Its course is characterized by exacerbations and remissions and occasionally accompanied by pruritus. Lichenoid drug eruptions often involve trunk and limbs symmetrically and are photodistributed. Atrophic lichen planus can occur anywhere, but favors the flexor wrists, trunk, medial thighs, shins, dorsal hands, and lower back. Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation is characterized by brown discoloration. Idiopathic eruptive macular pigmentation is characterized by asymptomatic, hyperpigmented pigmented macules involving the neck, trunk, and proximal extremities. Pityriasis rosea typically begins with a solitary patch, and then progresses to a generalized exanthem of bilateral and symmetric macules with a collarette of scale oriented within the long axes along cleavage lines. Patients with hemochromatosis present with diffuse hyperpigmentation, but usually have cirrhosis and diabetes mellitus. Macular urticarial pigmentosum presents with widespread yellow tan to red brown macules and usually involves the trunk more than the extremities. Treponemal eruptions, such as secondary syphilis, may also resemble erythema dyschromicum perstans. Therefore, serological testing for treponemes is appropriate when encountering this type of outbreak 删除10：<u>(Bahadir et al. 2004 )</u>.\n\n【16】Histopathology\n--------------\n\n【17】A punch biopsy was performed on the border of an active macule on the antecubital fossa. Hyperkeratosis, a thinned epidermis, focal vacuolar changes in the basal layer of the epidermis, superficial perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltration, and pigment incontinence were present 删除10：<u>(Elder 2009 )</u>.\n\n【18】Laboratory Studies\n------------------\n\n【19】A complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel were normal. A human immunodeficiency virus test and rapid plasma reagin test were negative.\n\n【20】Diagnosis\n---------\n\n【21】Erythema dyschromicum perstans (EDP)\n\n【22】Case Treatment\n--------------\n\n【23】The diagnosis of the disorder was discussed with the patient, along with its difficulty in treatment. Treatment options were discussed including hydroquinone, clofazimine, dapsone, and phototherapy. The patient declined clofazimine and dapsone due to the side effects of the medications. She was started on hydroquinone 4 % cream twice daily to affected areas. She also underwent narrowband UVB phototherapy three times a week. A broad spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 was recommended for use daily. At 2 month follow-up, she noted mild improvement.\n\n【24】Discussion\n----------\n\n【25】Erythema dyschromicum perstans (EDP) or “ashy dermatosis” was first described in 1957 by Ramirez in Salvadorans as an “asymptomatic, ash-colored, macular hyperpigmentation that is slowly progressive and leaves a permanent discoloration” 删除10：<u>(Ramirez 1957 )</u>. EDP is characterized by ash-like, slate gray, oval macules and patches with erythematous borders that range in diameter from 0.5 cm to very large confluent patches. Individual lesions can be oval, irregular, or polycyclic in shape and continue to grow slowly. Lesions initially appear on the trunk and spread centrifugally to the extremities . The scalp, palms, soles, and mucous membranes are rarely affected. As the lesions extend, the erythematous border eventually disappears within several months, so it may no longer be evident when the patient is examined. EDP has traditionally been characterized by its poor response to medication and its tendency to persist indefinitely in adult patients 删除10：<u>(Chun et al. 2009 )</u>.\n删除3：<u>Figure 15.2\n\n【26】Erythema dyschromicum perstans. Ash-like, hyperpigmented patches are noted on the chest\n</u>\nErythema dyschromicum perstans usually occurs in the second or third decade of life and is most common in individuals from Central and South America, although cases have been described from different parts of the world. It is somewhat more common in women. EDP usually appears in adults, but some isolated cases and a small series of eight cases have been reported in prepubertal children 删除10：<u>(Silverberg et al. 2003 )</u>.\n\n【27】The cause of EDP is unclear. Many consider EDP to be a variant of lichen planus actinus 删除10：<u>(Naidorf and Cohen 1982 )</u>. Infections, such as whipworm, HIV 删除10：<u>(Nelson et al. 1992 )</u>, exposure to environmental toxins, such as pesticides, ammonium nitrate, cobalt, radiocontrast media, and fungicides, and medications, such as oral antibiotics and benzodiazepines, have all been implicated in the etiology of EDP 删除10：<u>(Silverberg et al. 2003 )</u>. Systemic conditions such as thyroid disease and chronic hepatitis 删除10：<u>(Kontochristopoulos et al. 2001 )</u> have also been implicated.\n\n【28】Although many factors may be involved in the pathogenesis of EDP, an important genetic susceptibility appears to be conferred by genes located within the major histocompatibility complex region. HLA-DR association with the genetic susceptibility to develop EDP in Mexican Mestizo patients was analyzed in 23 patients with EDP. The most frequent allele was HLA-DR4 subtype \\*0407 (65 %), compared with 23 % in controls 删除10：<u>(Correa et al. 2007 )</u>.\n\n【29】Treatment\n---------\n\n【30】There is no definitive treatment for erythema dyschromicum perstans. A number of treatment modalities have been attempted, including antibiotics, topical corticosteroids, keratinolytic agents, isoniazid, chloroquine, and griseofulvin; however, all have had poor responses 删除10：<u>(Bahadir et al. 2004 )</u>. Although EDP is unlikely to resolve in adults, most prepubertal children have a course of spontaneous slow resolution within 2–3 years. Therefore, in children, the use of sun protection to avoid lesional prominence while awaiting spontaneous resolution is recommended 删除10：<u>(Silverberg et al. 2003 )</u>.\n\n【31】Recently, clofazimine has been used with some success in adults, apparently because of its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating effects. It is not clear, however, if clofazimine produces improvement by reducing the inflammatory infiltrate and postinflammatory hyperpigmentation or simply by masking the lesions with its characteristic yellow discoloration of the skin 删除10：<u>(Silverberg et al. 2003 )</u>. In one series of eight patients, seven had a good or excellent response to clofazimine administered either 100 mg every other day to patients weighing less than 40 kg or 100 mg every day to patients weighing more than 40 kg. This medication was continued for 3 months, then reduced to 200 mg/week and 400 mg/week, respectively. The one remaining patient had only a marginal response 删除10：<u>(Piquero-Martin et al. 1989 )</u>. This medication seems to have a valuable effect on the inflammatory phase of erythema dyschromicum perstans. Side effects of clofazimine include a temporary orange discoloration of the skin and the eye (i.e. cornea, conjunctivae); it also may produce ichthyosis. Its most serious adverse effect is crystal deposition in the intestines, producing a potentially fatal enteropathy. This rare complication is associated with months of high-dose (>100 mg/day) therapy. Nausea and diarrhea are more common. Splenic infarction and eosinophilic enteritis are also rare adverse effects 删除10：<u>(Piquero-Martin et al. 1989 )</u>.\n\n【32】A successful response to dapsone in one patient from Turkey has also been reported. Besides its antimicrobial potency, dapsone is effective in polymorphonuclear-rich dermatoses, as well as lymphocyte-rich dermatoses. It also has been shown to suppress neutrophil migration and the respiratory burst by interfering with T-cell immunity. Dapsone possibly plays a role in the regulation of immune responses involved in the pathogenesis of EDP. Nevertheless, more reports and studies are necessary 删除10：<u>(Bahadir et al. 2004 )</u>.\n\n【33】The use of narrow-band UVB phototherapy has been successful in a few patients with EDP 删除10：<u>(Tlougan et al. 2010 )</u>. By suppressing immune function and reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines, the photo-immunologic effects of UVB phototherapy assist in EDP treatment by exerting potent anti-inflammatory effects. UVB phototherapy also provides camouflages the dermal pigmentation by stimulating pigment production. Additionally, UVB phototherapy induces thickening of the stratum corneum and apoptosis of T lymphocytes, which causes a decrease in the lichenoid inflammatory infiltrate that often is observed in active areas of EDP. Narrowband UVB phototherapy has also been used recently in the treatment of other lichenoid pigmentary disorders with success. Thus, UV light may be a viable treatment option for patients with EDP 删除10：<u>(Tlougan et al. 2010 )</u>.\n\n【34】Key Points\n\n【35】*   Erythema dyschromicum perstans usually occurs in the second or third decade of life and is most common in individuals from Central and South America, although cases have been described from different parts of the world.\n\n【36】*   Erythema dyschromicum perstans has traditionally been characterized by its poor response to medication and its tendency to persist indefinitely in adult patients.\n\n【37】*   Erythema dyschromicum perstans is very difficult to treat; however, clofazimine and dapsone have shown success in a small group of patients.\n\n【38】*   The use of narrow-band UVB phototherapy has also been successful in a few patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The onset of labor more than 3 weeks before the estimated date of confine-ment (EDC) is considered preterm labor. If labor has not started spontaneously by2 weeks after the EDC， the pregnancy is considered postterm.****latent phase and an active phase. During the latent phase of labor， the contractions become stronger， longer lasting， and more coordinated. The active phase of labor， which usually starts at 3 to 4 cm of cervical dilation， is when the rate of cervical dilation is at its maximum. Contractions are usually strong and regular. In active labor in a woman without an epidural，the minimum expected rates of cervical dila-tion are 1.2 cm per hour for a nulliparous woman and 1.5 cm per hour for a parous woman. The second stage of labor is from complete cervical dilation (10 cm) through the delivery of the fetus. The combination of the force of the uterine contractions and the pushing efforts of the mother results in the delivery of the baby. A normal second stage lasts less than 2 hours in a nulliparous patient and less than 1 hour in a parous patient. The presence ofepidural anesthesia can prolong these times by up to 1 hour. The third stage of labor begins after the delivery of the baby and ends with the delivery of the placenta and membranes. The third stage is typically short and is considered prolonged if it lasts longer than 30 minutes.****The diagnosis of active labor is an indication for admission to the birthing unit for labor management and monitoring. The presence of ruptured membranes is also an indication for admission. The rupture of membranes can be confirmed by a careful vaginal examination performed with a sterile speculum and gloves. The visualization of fluid leaking from the cervical os， either spontaneously or with the patient performing a Valsalva maneuver， and the presence of amniotic fluid pool-ing in the posterior vaginal fornix are confirmatory. The detection of fluid in the vagina with a pH more than 6.5 is consistent with amniotic fluid， as normal vaginal secretions typically have a pH less than 5.5. Using a sterile applicator to sample vaginal fluid and applying it to Nitrazine paper can make this determination. The presence of semen， blood， or bacterial vaginosis can cause elevated pH in vaginal secretions and a false-positive Nitrazine test. The visualization of ferning of vaginal fluid under microscopic magnification of an air-dried sample also suggests the pres-ence of amniotic fluid.****requires that the membranes are ruptured. With either of these two techniques， a continuous graphic recording of the fetal heart rate is recorded. Alternatively， inter-mittent auscultation using a stethoscope or handheld Doppler can be performed. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that in intermittent auscultation of low-risk pregnancies， the fetal heart should be monitored after a contraction at least every 30 minutes during the first stage of labor and every 15 minutes in the second stage. In at-risk pregnancies， the monitor-ing frequency is increased to at least every 15 minutes during the first stage and to every 5 minutes in the second stage.**\n\n【14】**Important considerations in interpreting fetal heart rate data are the baseline heart rate， variability， and periodic heart rate changes. The baseline heart rate is the approximate average heart rate during a 10-minute tracing. A baseline heart rate of110 to 160 beats/ min is considered normal， less than 110 beats/ min is considered to be bradycardia， and greater than 160 beats/ min is considered to be tachycar-dia. Fetal bradycardia may occur with maternal hypothermia， certain medications given to the mother， congenital heart block， or may be a sign of significant fetal distress. Bradycardia may also be a normal variant. The most common cause of fetal tachycardia is maternal fever. Other common causes include medications and fetal arrhythmias.**\n\n【15】**Variability is regulated by the balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic con-trol of the sinoatrial node. Short-term variability is the change in fetal heart rate from one beat to the next and can only be accurately determined when an internal scalp electrode is placed.Normal short-term variability is 6 to 25 beats/ min. Long-term variability is the waviness of the baseline heart rate over 1 minute， with normal oscillations occurring at a rate of 3 to 5 cycles per minute. As variability is largely a manifestation of the autonomic nervous system， anything that affects nervous system functioning can affect it. Common causes of decreased variability are fetal sleep cycles， central ner vous system (CNS) depressant drugs (such as narcotic anal-gesics) given to the mother， congenital neurologic abnormalities， and prematurity. Fetal acidemia secondary to hypoxemia can impair CN S function and reduce vari-ability. The presence of normal variability makes fetal acidemia unlikely.**\n\n【16】**Periodic heart rate changes are the accelerations and decelerations from the base-line heart rate that occur， often related to uterine contractions. An acceleration is an increase in the fetal heart rate of 15 beats/min or more for 15 seconds or lon-ger and is a reassuring finding. The presence of accelerations， whether occurring spontaneously or in response to contractions， fetal movement， or stimulation of the fetus (either scalp stimulation during a cervical examination or vibroacoustic stimulation using an artificial larynx) virtually ensures that the fetal arterial pH is greater than 7.2.****Current fetal monitoring equipment also allows for contraction monitoring along with the fetal heart rate assessment. An external tocodynamometer is most commonly used. It allows for evaluation of the presence and timing of contractions but does not measure the strength of the contractions. To assess the strength of contractions， an internal intrauterine pressure catheter (IUPC) can be placed. Like the fetal scalp electrode， this requires the presence of ruptured membranes. An IUPC can be useful when the first stage of labor is not progressing at an expected rate， as the frequency and power of contractions can be directly measured. Con-tractions that are inadequate in frequency or power may be augmented with an oxytocic agent. Intravenous oxytocin is the drug of choice， as it is effective， inex-pensive， and most practitioners are familiar with its usage. Oxytocin has a short half-life， which allows it to be given by continuous infusion and allows for the rapid cessation of its activity when it is discontinued. Labor augmentation with oxytocin can cause uterine hyperstimulation， defined as the presence of six or more contrac-tions in a 10-minute period that causes nonreassuring fetal heart rate abnormali-ties (such as late decelerations). This would be managed by reduction in dose or discontinuation of the oxytocin， repositioning of the patient， and providing oxygen via face mask to the mother.**\n\n【17】**Fetal heart tracings (FH T) can be categorized into three categories： I， II， and III， the determination of which further guides management. It is simplest to learn the definitions of categories I and III as category II tends to be everything in between. A category I FHT is considered normal and includes each of the five characteris-tics： a baseline heart rate of 110 to 160 beats/ min， moderate baseline FHR variabil-ity， no late or variable decelerations， and both accelerations and early decelerations maybe absent or present. A category III FH T is considered abnormal and includes either absent baseline FHR variability plus any one of the following three： repeated late decelerations， variable decelerations or bradycardia， or a sinusoidal pattern. A category II FHT is considered indeterminable. This category includes a variety of findings， none of which can be categorized into I or III.****Of deliveries in the United States， 20% or more are accomplished via cesarean delivery. The most common indications are a history of prior cesarean delivery， arrest of labor or descent， fetal distress necessitating immediate delivery， and breech presentation. Operative vaginal delivery can be performed using either forceps or vacuum assistance. These can only be used when the cervix is completely dilated， membranes are ruptured， the presenting part is the vertex of the scalp， and there is no disproportion between the size of the fetal head and maternal pelvis. If any of these conditions are not met and delivery must be accomplished urgently， a cesar-ean delivery is indicated.****GBS testing is routinely done between 35 and 37 weeks' gestational age. Testing is done by swabbing the vagina， perineum， and anus with a sterile culture applicator.****Positive GBS screen collected at 35+ weeks’gestational age**Preterm labor (prior to 37 weeks)\n\n【18】**Amniotic membrane rupture more than 18 hours**\n\n【19】**Intrapartum fever (temperature>100.4°F)****distress， angioedema， or anaphylaxis， susceptibility of the isolate to erythromycin or clindamycin should be tested.

This patient has complicated diverticulitis， with recurrent disease (as defined by two or more complicated episodes)； she is a low surgical risk and thus should be evaluated for resection. Barium enema (answer C) is contra-indicated due to risk of perforation， and dietary recommendations regarding nuts and seeds (answer D) are unsupported by data. Colonoscopy (answer B) should be postponed until at least 6 weeks after the acute case of diverticulitis to avoid perforation.**\n\n【29】**22.2 C. This patient has right lower abdominal tenderness and fever， which is most likely due to acute appendicitis. The most common cause of an acute abdo-men at any age is appendicitis. Ischemic bowel (answer D) usually presents with severe abdominal pain out of proportion to abdominal examination findings and often with a history of atherosclerotic vascular disease. Sepsis due to a urinary tract infection (answer E) is a common cause of septic shock and hypotension， but it usually does not cause abdominal findings； flank ten-derness or merely generalized sepsis is more common.**\n\n【30】**22.3 C. CT imaging is the modality of choice in evaluating diverticulitis. Barium enema (answer A) and endoscopy tend to increase intraluminal pressure and can worsen diverticulitis or lead to colonic rupture. Colonoscopy and flexible sigmoidoscopy (answer B) are also contraindicated in the acute setting and should be delayed until 6 weeks after to rule out a neoplasm. Observation(answer E) is not appropriate in this patient before a complete evaluation is performed.**\n\n【31】**22.4 B. This patient has ischemic colitis， which is suggested by his acute presen-tation of bloody stools， diffuse abdominal pain， absent bowel sounds， and hypotension. This patient has several risk factors for ischemic colitis， such as coronary artery disease and history of aortic aneurysm repair (weaken-ing of vessel wall). Although arteriovenous malformation (answer C) and angiodysplasia are common causes of lower GI bleeds， they do not usually present with severe abdominal pain and shock， and the patient usually has a history of renal disease. Colorectal cancer (answer D) is a chronic condition that may present with lower GI bleed， anemia， changes in bowel habits，and weight loss，**\n\n【32】**22.5 D. This elderly patient is quite ill. Although her current blood pressure is normal， her temperature of 103.8 °F， tachycardia， and leukocytosis portend serious illness. The patient should be admitted to the hospital for inpatient management. The physical findings point toward an abdominal process. Regardless of the etiology， this patient should be treated within 1 hour(optimally after blood and urine cultures). Treatment includes intravenous antibiotics that are broad spectrum and target gram-negative rods as well as anaerobic bacteria，intravenous fluids， and serum lactate level. A CT scan of the abdomen is important to assess the etiology of the abdominal pain and decide appropriate therapy based on the findings. Answers A and B**\n\n【33】**CLINICAL PEARLS**\n\n【34】Acute diverticulitis usually presents with left lower quadrant pain， fever， leukocytosis， and constipation and often with signs of peritoneal inflammation.\n\n【35】Inpatient management of diverticulitis is indicated in patients with com-plications such as peritonitis， abscess， and strictures or in patients who are at high risk of morbidity and mortality.\n\n【36】Some patients can be managed on an outpatient basis and should be reevaluated in 2 to 3 days to monitor resolution of symptoms.\n\n【37】Uncomplicated diverticulitis can be treated medically with antibiotics and bowel rest.\n\n【38】Diverticulitis can be complicated by perforation with peritonitis； peri-colic abscess； fistula formation， often to the bladder； and strictures with colonic obstruction.

There, computed tomography (CT) of his head revealed a large (> 100 cm <sup>3 </sup> ) intracerebral hemorrhage, extending into the lateral ventricles and associated with hydrocephalus. An external ventricular drain (EVD) was placed, and he was found to have elevated intracerebral pressure (ICP). Over the first 48 hours, the patient’s ICP was difficult to control. After 6 days the patient remained in a coma and dependent on a ventilator, but with some brainstem reflexes (eg, gag reflex, blink reflex) intact. All of the caregivers involved, including the patient’s wife, who is his legally designated health care proxy, recognized that there was no meaningful chance for a good neurologic outcome. A decision is made by all involved to stop the patient’s ventilator, intravenous fluids, and medications, understanding that he would die shortly thereafter. The patient’s wife then asks about organ donation, observing that the patient had long expressed an interest in organ donation and was registered with the Department of Motor Vehicles as an organ donor.\n\n【3】 Is it ethically and morally permissible to discontinue this patient’s life support, knowing that he will die as a result? If so, how should such a decision be made?\n\n【4】 Would the analysis be different if the patient did not need a ventilator but only was receiving tube feedings?\n\n【5】 Would the analysis be different if the patient was in a coma and lacked all brainstem reflexes, including the drive to breathe?\n\n【6】 Can this patient be an organ donor?\n\n【7】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【8】#### Discontinuing Life Support\n\n【9】### DEFINITIONS\n\n【10】ADVANCE DIRECTIVES : Instructions that a formerly competent patient left regarding his or her medical care in the event he or she was to become incompetent. Examples include living wills, designating a health care proxy, or even conversations with family, friends, or health care professionals.\n\n【11】BEST INTEREST STANDARD : This is used to supplement advance directives or substituted judgment in decision-making for an incompetent patient. Under this standard, decision-makers try to estimate what is in the patient’s best interests, all things considered.\n\n【12】SUBSTITUTED JUDGMENT : This is when a health care proxy attempts to make the decision that the patient would have made, based on knowledge of his or her values, preferences, and approach to decision-making. Only surrogates who knew the patient prior to losing his or her capacity can exercise substituted judgment.\n\n【13】### CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【14】When making important decisions for an incompetent patient, clinicians must understand the various standards for making decisions and their ethical priority. When decisions are difficult or contentious, clinicians should consult widely, most importantly with ethics consultants, to help with decisions and to provide an independent check of their thinking. When a decision to withhold or withdraw LST is being considered, then clinicians must also understand ethical and moral norms regarding LST. In the discussion below, standards for decision-making and moral norms about LST are discussed in detail.\n\n【15】### DISCUSSION\n\n【16】##### _Is it ethically and morally permissible to discontinue this patient’s life support knowing that he will die as a result?_\n\n【17】Yes. Properly selected or designated health care proxies can withhold or withdraw LSTs on behalf of an incapacitated patient. This conclusion is widely accepted in the practice of medicine, biomedical ethics, and in the law, and can be defended fairly straightforwardly by recognizing following two principles:\n\n【18】1\\. Competent informed patients have the right to refuse any medical interventions, life-sustaining or not, even if it would result in their death coming sooner than it otherwise would.\n\n【19】2\\. Incompetent patients do not lose this right (but it must be exercised by others on their behalf).\n\n【20】These two principles are generally quite uncontroversial. The first is recognition of the competent patient’s right to self-determination (also expressed as respect for the patient’s autonomy). The second reflects recognition that patients without decision-making capacity should have access to all the options that competent patients would have, including the right to refuse LST. This reflects a deep respect for the rights of disabled or incompetent patients.\n\n【21】The tricky part is exercising the right to refuse LST on behalf of an incapacitated patient. There are some decision-making standards that should be applied in such situations. The following standards are arranged in a rough order of priority, from highest to lowest. When a higher-priority standard is unavailable, decision-makers must rely on a lower-priority standard.\n\n【22】1\\. The patient’s previously expressed wishes (advance directives) : This could be in the form of a specific document that details what should be done in certain medical situations (eg, a living will), or it could simply be knowledge of pertinent prior conversations with physicians, family, or friends.\n\n【23】2\\. The substituted judgment standard : Substituted judgment occurs when family or friends who knew the patient attempt to make the decision that the patient would have made, based on their knowledge of his or her values, preferences, and approach to decision-making. Only persons who knew the patient before he or she lost decision-making capacity are in a position to exercise substituted judgment. Physicians cannot exercise substituted judgment on behalf of a patient they did not know previously. There is a rough order of priority when it comes to deciding who is in the best position to exercise substituted judgment. The order can vary somewhat from state to state, and not every state specifies an order in statutes. But in case law or in statutes, most states respect something like the following priorities, listed from highest to lowest:\n\n【24】a. Anyone that the patient previously designated as a decision-maker. This is usually done officially by way of assigning someone durable power of attorney for health care, or in some states executing a health care proxy that assigns a decision-making agent. When the patient did not previously designate someone, the remaining persons in this list are generally involved.\n\n【25】b. Spouse\n\n【26】c. Adult children\n\n【27】d. Parents\n\n【28】e. Siblings\n\n【29】f. Extended family members\n\n【30】g. Acquaintances\n\n【31】3\\. Best interests standard : Under this standard, decision-makers who do not know the patient’s prior values or priorities try to make a decision about what would be best for this patient, all things considered. This standard is applied for patients who have never had capacity (children or the cognitively disabled), or when no one is available who knows the patient well enough to exercise substituted judgement on his or her behalf.\n\n【32】In the case described above, we are unaware of any advance directives that apply to this situation. The patient did designate his wife as his health care proxy, which reassures us that he made the conscious decision that his wife would be the best individual to exercise substituted judgment on his behalf. This patient’s wife has to exercise substituted judgment on her husband’s behalf.\n\n【33】Physicians and other medical professionals can help her by describing her role (eg, “Your job is to help us make the decision that your husband would have made”) and by helping her to explore her husband’s preferences and values through discussion and questioning. For example, clinicians might say things like, “Help us understand your husband as a person. What did he value most in life? How did he feel about medical care? About disability? About being dependent on others?” Such a conversation achieves several important goals. First, it helps clinicians better understand their patient as an individual. It also signals to family and friends that clinicians care about the patient as an individual, which can be very helpful in establishing trust that clinicians have the patient’s interests firmly in mind. It helps focus the surrogate on the right questions—for example, “Would my husband want to be kept alive with LST, given the prognosis?”—rather than focusing on minutiae—for example, “How difficult or painful is the procedure for placing a gastrostomy tube?”—that only distract from the important questions.\n\n【34】After such a conversation, it is perfectly permissible for clinicians to make a specific recommendation if it seems clear what the patient would have wanted. For example, if the conversation revealed that the patient was someone who highly valued his personal bodily integrity, his independence, and intellectual and interpersonal pursuits, it might be clear that he would not want to continue LST. If so, it would be reasonable for a clinician to say something like, “Based on our discussions, it sounds to me like your husband would not want to continue LST. I think what we should do is change the focus of our care to simply make him comfortable, and we should stop the things we’re doing that are only prolonging his life, like the ventilator. Does this sound to you like a decision he would have made?”\n\n【35】Contrast this with an impersonal approach, employed all too commonly, in which clinicians simply describe the medical situation and the prognosis, and then ask the surrogate, “What do you want us to do?” This approach has one (somewhat dubious) advantage, which is that it allows clinicians to feel like they are “off the hook” in terms of moral responsibility for withdrawing or withholding LST, and it doesn’t require a sometimes emotionally challenging conversation about the patient as an individual. It has major disadvantages, however. It can signal to surrogates that the clinician is indifferent to the outcome (“We’ll do whatever you tell us to do”). It fails to remind the surrogate that her job is to make the decision that the patient would have made, rather than the decision that she prefers. Perhaps most importantly, it places all of the decision-making burden on surrogates, which can make it psychologically impossible for some to authorize the withdrawal of LST, even when it may be clear to all that the patient would have wanted it.\n\n【36】##### _Would the analysis be different if the patient did not need a ventilator but only tube feedings?_\n\n【37】Imagine that the patient was breathing adequately on his own but remained unconscious or minimally conscious, such that he could not be fed safely and adequately by mouth. In this situation, the only LST required by the patient is tube feedings (initially through a nasogastric tube, or later through a gastrostomy). Are surrogates permitted to withhold tube feedings on behalf of an incapacitated patient? Tube feedings (including water for hydration) are sometimes called artificial hydration and nutrition (AHN), or medically administered hydration and nutrition (MHN).\n\n【38】Again, the answer is yes. It is now well established in Western law, ethics, and the medical profession that AHN is no different than any other life-prolonging medical therapy. Competent patients have the right to refuse AHN even if would mean that they will die, just as they have a right to refuse ventilator support or any other medical intervention. Because respect for the incompetent patient requires that he or she has the same right, exercised through a surrogate, the wife in this case has the right to refuse AHN on her husband’s behalf.\n\n【39】##### _Would the analysis be different if the patient was in a coma and lacked all brainstem reflexes, including the drive to breathe?_\n\n【40】Patients who have experienced an irreversible whole-brain injury that eliminates consciousness and all the brainstem reflexes, including the drive to breathe, can and should be pronounced dead on the basis of brain death criteria. In all the states of the United States and in most developed Western nations, death can be diagnosed in two ways. The first is using cardiorespiratory criteria. Perhaps obviously, a patient who has irreversibly lost the ability to circulate blood and/or exchange gases through respiration is dead. The second is by way of brain death criteria. There are formal procedures for pronouncing death by brain criteria. The brain injury must be irreversible. There must be no reversible conditions that could mimic brain death (eg, drugs, hypothermia, neuromuscular conditions producing paralysis). The patient must be comatose—having no signs of interaction with the external or internal environment. All brainstem reflexes must be absent. Finally, the drive to breathe, mediated by the lower brainstem, must be absent, as determined through an apnea test. Once these criteria are satisfied, then the patient is pronounced brain dead.\n\n【41】If the patient in this case were brain dead, then this would no longer be a case involving end-of-life decision-making, because no decisions remain, apart from the timing of discontinuing the ventilator and other medical interventions. Physicians are under no legal or moral obligation to continue LST for patients pronounced dead, because no therapy can sustain life in these circumstances. It should be noted that in two US states (New Jersey and New York), limited exceptions exist for families who do not accept the concept of brain death on religious grounds.\n\n【42】Naturally, after pronouncing death by brain death criteria, obligations to the family do not cease. Physicians are obliged to explain brain death carefully and sensitively. It is permissible to continue LST for a brief period even after brain death has been declared to allow families to understand the situation and say their last goodbyes. Pronouncing death by brain death criteria has implications for organ donation as well. This is discussed further in the following section.\n\n【43】##### _Can this patient be an organ donor?_\n\n【44】If the patient in the case were brain dead, then he could potentially donate all of his vital organs, including his heart and lungs. This is possible because brain-dead donors can serve as so-called beating heart donors. They may have their vital organs (eg, whole liver, pancreas, both kidneys, and portions of the gastrointestinal tract) removed even while circulation and respiration continue. This does not violate the dead donor rule (DDR), which states that patients must not be killed by the process of organ donation, because persons pronounced brain dead are already dead before the process of organ retrieval begins.\n\n【45】The patient in the original case is not brain dead. Although he is comatose, he still has some brainstem reflexes. Therefore, it would violate the DDR to retrieve his vital organs while his heart is still beating. However, he might be a candidate for DCD. In other words, after his LST has been discontinued, and after he is pronounced dead on the basis of cardiorespiratory criteria, it might be possible to procure some of his vital organs. In our case, DCD would play out roughly as follows:\n\n【46】1\\. The patient’s wife and clinicians agree that the patient would want to withdraw LST.\n\n【47】2\\. Representatives of the organ donation system (not the clinical team) would discuss the possibility of DCD.\n\n【48】3\\. If a decision is made to pursue DCD, then the ventilator is discontinued while the patient is monitored for evidence of death by cardiorespiratory criteria.\n\n【49】4\\. If death (absence of circulation and respiration) occurs within approximately 60 minutes, organ procurement can begin.\n\n【50】DCD necessarily involves a period of hypoperfusion of the organs, which has two important consequences. First, DCD can only be performed for donors who are on ventilator support, because death by cardiorespiratory criteria must happen within 60 minutes (some institutions have a slightly longer limit, up to 90 minutes). Patients on tube feedings alone cannot donate using DCD protocols, because they will usually take days to die after tube feedings are discontinued, which would render their organs unsuitable for donation. The second consequence of the period of hypoperfusion is that the heart and lungs cannot generally be donated, and the organs that are donated have a slightly lower chance of graft survival in the recipient.\n\n【51】For some patients who die too slowly for DCD, tissue donation may still be possible. Tissues that can be donated may include bone, heart valves, veins, skin, ligaments, and tendons.\n\n【52】###", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

She claims that she sometimes goes two-three months without a period. On further questioning, she also complains of vaginal dryness and occasional hot flashes. Blood tests reveal an estrogen level of 22 pg/mL (normal: 60-400 pg/mL), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level of 100 mlU/L (normal: 1-26 mlU/L), and luteinizing hormone level of 50 mlU/mL (normal: 1-12 mlU/L), without surge. Which of the following is most likely the primary cause of this patient’s symptoms?\n\n【1】> (A) Decreased estrogen levels\n\n【2】> (B) Decreased feedback on the anterior pituitary\n\n【3】> (C) Increased FSH levels\n\n【4】> (D) Increased progesterone levels\n\n【5】> (E) Increased testosterone levels\n\n【6】 **Answer**: The correct answer is A . Menopause is the cessation of estrogen production because of a loss of ovarian sensitivity to gonadotropin stimulation caused by ovarian dysfunction and a decreased number of available ovarian follicles. In the United States, the average age at onset of menopause is 51 years, with a normal range between 45-55 years. Remember, menopause causes HAVOC : H ot flashes, A trophy of the V agina, Osteoporosis, and Coronary artery disease (CAD). Estrogen is necessary for the maintenance and development of the vagina and bone deposition, so a decrease leads to vaginal atrophy and osteoporosis. There is no direct link between estrogen and heart disease, but the incidence of CAD following menopause is two to three times higher than in premenopausal women, suggesting some protective effect of endogenous estrogen. Hot flashes are related to changes in the ability of the hypothalamus to recognize body temperature. Because estrogen replacement therapy alleviates these symptoms, there may be a role for estrogen in body temperature regulation. The estrogen level in this patient is low (<100 pg/ml), and levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) are elevated. FSH and LH levels are elevated in menopause because of decreased feedback inhibition from estrogen, but these levels are not the primary cause of menopause.  \n\n【7】Answer B is incorrect . Decreased negative feedback on the pituitary occurs secondary to decreased levels of estrogen. A primary decrease in negative feedback would lead to increased levels of FSH and LH and therefore increased levels of estrogen. However, this patient shows symptoms of decreased estrogen.  \n\n【8】Answer C is incorrect . Although increased FSH levels are found in menopause, this is secondary to decreased estrogen levels, which decrease negative feedback on the anterior pituitary. The increased FSH level itself is not known to be the cause of menopausal symptoms. The symptoms are due to low levels of estrogen.  \n\n【9】Answer D is incorrect . High levels of progesterone may result in fatigue, depression, and vaginal dryness. However, this woman’s symptoms are more characteristic of menopause, which is due to low levels of estrogen.  \n\n【10】Answer E is incorrect . Increased testosterone levels in a woman are classically seen in congenital adrenal hyperplasia or polycystic ovarian syndrome and lead to masculine features such as hirsutism. Testosterone levels are typically low in menopause.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Otherwise, she has been  删除换行 very healthy, eats well and is slim and active. She attends line dancing every week and enjoys  删除换行 being with her friends and helping out in the local library. She used to smoke up to 10 ciga删除8：<u>￾</u>rettes a day but gave up 12 years ago after a friend died from lung cancer. She does not wear  删除换行 glasses and has never had visual problems before. Annual health checks carried out by the  删除换行 practice nurse (the most recent 1 month previously) have not revealed any problems such as  删除换行 hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia or diabetes. There is no family history of eye problems  删除换行 such as glaucoma. The last eye test she had was about 2 years previously and she would have  删除换行 visited her optometrist but her neighbour has just been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis  删除换行 that started with visual loss so she thought to come first to her GP. On questioning her fur删除8：<u>￾</u>ther, the GP elicits that both eyes appear to be affected and that the visual loss has indeed  删除换行 been gradual; she has no eye pain, photophobia or redness; no headaches in general, tempo删除8：<u>￾</u>ral headache, new fatigue, fever or muscle pain; she has not noticed photophobia or haloes  删除换行 around lights; and she has not noticed flashing lights or new floaters. There is slight glare  删除换行 when looking at lights.\n\n【3】On examining her, the GP finds that her vision using a half-size Snellen chart at 3 m reveals  删除换行 6/9 vision in both eyes. Her vision is not improved by using a pinhole. Her eyes look normal  删除换行 and there is no redness. Using an ophthalmoscope, the GP can see an equal and bright red  删除换行 reflex from each pupil at 1 m and there are direct and consensual pupil responses. Using  删除换行 the ophthalmoscope close up, both lenses appear dark with no whiteness in the pupil. The \n\n【4】GP cannot see any abnormalities on fundal examination. There are no visual field defects  删除换行 revealed by using the confrontation method. The patient can see in each quadrant. The  删除换行 patient appears well on a general examination.\n\n【5】Questions\n\n【6】• What would the differential diagnosis be of gradual loss of vision in this patient?\n\n【7】• What should the GP do next?\n\n【8】• What advice and services are there available for this patient?删除5：<u>202</u>\n删除7：<u>100 Cases in General Practice, Second Edition</u>\nANSWER 98\n\n【9】Visual loss is gradual so conditions such as retinal detachment, vitreous haemorrhage, retinal  删除换行 artery or vein occlusion or optic neuritis are very unlikely. History and examination do not  删除换行 suggest these nor do they suggest the other more common causes of acute visual loss: acute  删除换行 angle-closure glaucoma, temporal arteritis and iritis. The most common causes of gradual  删除换行 visual loss are refractive errors (such as myopia and hypermetropia), cataracts, age-related  删除换行 macular degeneration (AMD), chronic open-angle glaucoma or compression of optic nerves. \n\n【10】With no improvement of vision using a pinhole, refractive error is unlikely. Examination did  删除换行 not reveal cataracts. History and examination do not suggest glaucoma or compression of  删除换行 optic nerves. Macular degeneration is a possibility. The patient’s age, race and past history of  删除换行 smoking are risk factors in this situation. Think through how the history and examination  删除换行 findings relate to each of these differential diagnoses.\n\n【11】Because the GP is suspecting AMD and is therefore concerned that the patient may have  删除换行 neovascular/wet AMD (although the history is of gradual and minor visual loss and therefore  删除换行 it is more likely to be atrophic/dry AMD) the patient is referred urgently to the local ophthal删除8：<u>￾</u>mology service for assessment. Two weeks later, the GP receives a letter from the clinic to say  删除换行 that they have found early dry AMD in both eyes with a number of soft medium-sized drusen  删除换行 evident under both retinas. There is mild refractive error but nothing requiring glasses and  删除换行 no sign of cataracts, glaucoma or optic nerve compression or anything to suggest a more seri删除8：<u>￾</u>ous cause of her visual loss.\n\n【12】The clinic has talked to the patient about the condition and the prognosis: she may not  删除换行 develop late AMD. With AMD in both eyes, about 14% of sufferers will develop late AMD  删除换行 in at least one eye after 10 years. They also explain that there are steps that she can take to  删除换行 further reduce her risk of late AMD. They advise her not to restart smoking, to continue to  删除换行 exercise regularly and to eat a diet rich in leafy green vegetables and fresh fruit to improve  删除换行 concentrations of macular pigment in the fundi. It is also recommended to keep her weight  删除换行 normal and have annual health checks to make sure that she is not developing hypertension  删除换行 or diabetes that might further compromise her vision. The patient has been told that with her  删除换行 mild symptoms, it is safe for her to drive. She is not affected badly enough to be registered as  删除换行 sight-impaired. They further offer annual eye checks at the clinic to determine if her AMD is  删除换行 advancing. Many hospitals offer low vision clinics which aim to help people with poor eye删除8：<u>￾</u>sight make the most of their vision and provide a bridge between the hospital, social services  删除换行 and charities that support visually impaired people.

Such a localized problem  删除换行 suggests an exogenous aetiology 通用删除1(英):<u>(the photograph that is Fig. 7.1 provides a clue)</u>. The  删除换行 most likely diagnosis is allergic contact dermatitis (ACD), although it can be very diffi删除8：<u>￾</u>cult to differentiate clinically between ACD and irritant contact dermatitis. Occasionally,  删除换行 psoriasis may present with a single plaque, particularly at a site of trauma (Koebner’s  删除换行 effect); however, it is rarely as pruritic as this eruption. Atopic dermatitis is usually  删除换行 a more generalized and diffuse eruption; however discoid or nummular eczema is  删除换行 characterized by fairly well defined, coin-shaped, intensely pruritic inflamed areas of  删除换行 lichenified skin. An inflammatory tinea corporis particularly associated with a zoophilic  删除换行 organism might also be considered. The presentation of contact dermatitis can be varied,  删除换行 including dyspigmentation, pustular lesions, urticaria, atrophy, phototoxic reactions and  删除换行 eczema.\n\n【11】It would be appropriate to obtain a skin scraping for mycology investigations. Patch  删除换行 testing  is the diagnostic test to detect sensitization to contact allergens. \n\n【12】(Although patch testing is not required for diagnosis; nickel allergy is one of the  删除换行 few types of allergic contact dermatitis where the history of exposure along with  删除换行 the signs and symptoms are quite distinctive.) In fact many patients do not present  删除换行 to medical practitioners as they may well work out the association themselves. If a  删除换行 patch test series confirms the presence of nickel allergy, its relevance to the current  删除换行 eruption should be confirmed. A dimethylglyoxime (DMG) test is a simple, inexpen删除8：<u>￾</u>sive way to determine whether the object in question contains nickel by a pink colour  删除换行 change. Chromate, palladium and cobalt are commonly found together with nickel and  删除换行 concomitant allergy may coexist.\n\n【13】Nickel is a leading cause of allergic contact dermatitis and is responsible for more cases  删除换行 than all other metals combined. Certain occupations with high exposure to nickel, such  删除换行 as cashiers, hairdressers, metal workers, domestic cleaners, food handlers, bar work删除8：<u>￾</u>ers, and painters, are also at risk for acquiring nickel dermatitis. Patients with atopic  删除换行 eczema are also at increased risk. Sweating may increase the severity of the dermati删除8：<u>￾</u>tis. Sodium chloride in the sweat causes corrosion of the metal and increases nickel  删除换行 exposure. \n\n【14】The management of this case includes removal of the offending nickel-containing belt  删除换行 buckle or trouser rivet and application of topical corticosteroid creams until the erup删除8：<u>￾</u>tion has resolved.

He was diagnosed about 1 year ago. He gives a history of smoking cigarettes (one pack a day for30 years) but has no other medical problems. His general appearance is that of a thin male who appears to be in mild distress. His cardiac examination is nor-mal， but he is noted to have an expanded anterior-posterior diameter of the chest with expiratory wheezes and breathing through pursed lips. A chest x-ray reveals hyperinflated lung fields bilaterally and no infiltrates. The patient’s physician recommends spirometry to differentiate emphysema， which is an obstructive pulmonary disorder， from restrictive lung diseases.**\n\n【1】**What effect does emphysema have on the functional residual capacity and FEV?**\n\n【2】**What effect does a restrictive lung disease process have on the functional residual capacity and FEV?**\n\n【3】**What are some nonrespiratory functions of the lung?**\n\n【4】**ANSWERS TO CASE 17： FUNCTION OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM**\n\n【5】Summary： A 55-year-old man with a long smoking history has emphysema and increasing shortness of breath.\n\n【6】**Emphysema： Increases the functional residual capacity， decreases FEV.**\n\n【7】Restrictive lung disease： Decreases the functional residual capacity and decreases FEV.\n\n【8】**Nonrespiratory functions of the lung： Airway and immune defense mechanisms and biosynthetic functions.**\n\n【9】**CLINICAL CORRELATION**\n\n【10】**Emphysema is a pulmonary disease that results in destruction of the elastic tis-sue in the lungs. o，-Antitrypsin， which normally is produced by the liver and certain inflammatory cells， acts within the lung to inhibit neutrophil elastase and other serine proteases. Serine proteases destroy lung tissue when they are not inhibited. Smoking is a contributing factor to emphysema because it inhibits the action of o. -antitrypsin， resulting in destruction of the elastic tissue in the lungs. A patient also may have a genetic deficiency for 删除17：<u>个</u>，-antitrypsin. Destruction of the elastic tissue of the lung results in increased lung compliance and a tendency for the airways to collapse during expiration， thus CCtrapping air in the lungs. The decreased lung compliance allows for greater recoil of the chest wall， which results in an increase in functional residual volume. This is visualized during the physical examination as an increased anterior-posterior diameter (barrel-shaped chest) and on chest x-ray as hyperinflated lungs.**\n\n【11】**APPROACHTO RESPIRATORY PHYSIOLOGY**\n\n【12】**Objectives**\n\n【13】1Understand compliance of the chest wall.删除5：<u>2</u>\n**Discuss dynamic compression of the airways and its importance in limiting airflow during expiration.**\n\n【14】**3\\. Understand the nonrespiratory functions of the lung.**\n\n【15】**Definitions**\n\n【16】**Dynamic compression： Narrowing of the airways because of increases in intrathoracic pressure.**\n\n【17】**Mucociliary transport： The trapping of inhaled particles in the mucus secreted by the airways and the subsequent transport of those particles orally by the directed beating of airways ciliated epithelial cells.**\n\n【18】**DISCUSSION**\n\n【19】**Compliance of the lung was discussed in Case 16 in relation to a premature infant with a deficit in pulmonary surfactant. In that patient there was a decrease in lung compliance as a result of abnormally high surface tension at the alveolar-capillary interface. The infant presented with atelectasis， retrac-tion of the chest， and labored breathing. The increased elastic recoil of the lung(decreased compliance) was pulling the chest wall inward and made inspira-tion difficult. In emphysema， the compliance of the lung is increased because of loss of lung elasticity and destruction of alveoli and small air-ways. Emphysema has minimal to no effects on the compliance (elastic recoil) of the chest wall. Therefore， the increased lung compliance (decreased lung elastic recoil) allows the elastic recoil of the chest wall to expand the chest more than normal and induce hyperinflation of the lungs， with a result-ant increase in functional residual capacity.**\n\n【20】As discussed in Case 16， expiration is accomplished mostly by elastic recoil of the lungs. Although airflow during expiration can be increased through activity of the muscles of expiration， their effect is limited by what is called dynamic compression of the airways. Contraction of the muscles of expiration will increase intrathoracic pressure to values above atmospheric， and this increase will compress alveoli to aid in expelling air. However， because many divisions of the airways are within the thorax， the airways are being compressed by that same increase in intrathoracic pressure. As the air-ways are compressed， resistance to airflow increases dramatically. The increased resistance limits airflow such that a large part of a forced vital capac-ity (FVC) is effort independent. In emphysema， the decrease in elastic recoil and the destruction of alveoli and airways， which decreases interdependence， magnifies the effect of dynamic compression such that air is trapped resulting in a hyperinflated lungs.\n\n【21】**The elastic and bony structures that constitute the chest wall are arranged so that at functional residual capacity， the chest wall has a tendency to spring outward. Not until lung volumes of approximately 75% of vital capacity are reached is the chest wall at an equilibrium position. This elastic recoil of the chest wall at any lung volume depends on the compliance of the chest wall. Chest wall compliance can be altered in states such as scoliosis and ankylos-ing spondylitis， in which the spine， ribs， and vertebral joints are altered so that compliance is decreased. This can result in a reduction in all lung volumes， including functional residual capacity. Although they do not affect chest wall compliance， neuromuscular diseases can affect respiration； functional resid-ual capacity often will be normal， but residual volume will be increased， and other volumes， capacities， and forced volumes will be reduced.**\n\n【22】**In addition to gas exchange， the pulmonary system is involved in a number of other functions， many of which are related to defense. The air people breathe is far from pure， and there are both mechanical and chemical defenses to protect the lungs and prevent invasion of the body through the**\n\n【23】**lungs. Before its arrival in the alveoli， the bulk of inspired air， especially par-ticles larger than 1 mm， come into contact with the walls of the conducting air-ways. Those walls are lined with cells that secrete mucus and possess cilia that beat with a motion that moves particles toward the oropharynx， where they can be swallowed. Smaller particles that can reach terminal airways and alveoli are removed by macrophages. There also is an abundant immune system com-posed of lymphocytes and dendritic cells. Many of the phagocytic and immune cells produce reactive oxygen molecules， which can be detrimental to lung tissue， especially in the face of the relatively high oxygen levels exist-ing within the alveoli. To deal with these molecules， lung surfactant contains high levels of the antioxidant glutathione.**\n\n【24】The lung also is very metabolically active. Many biogenic amines are inac-tivated in the lung， including serotonin， bradykinin， and several arachidonic acid metabolites. In contrast， the relatively inactive angiotensin I is converted to the very active angiotensin II as it passes through the lungs.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Squalene\n\n【2】B. HMG-CoA\n\n【3】C. Lanosterol\n\n【4】D. Isopentenyl pyrophosphate\n\n【5】E. Cholesterol\n\n【6】**Answer**: 34.1 E . The major regulatory enzyme of cholesterol metabolism, HMG-CoA reductase, is regulated by 3 distinct mechanisms. The first is phosphorylation by a cAMP dependent protein kinase. Phosphorylation of HMG-CoA reductase inactivates the enzyme. The other 2 mechanisms involve the levels of cholesterol. The degradation of the enzyme is controlled by cholesterol levels. The half-life of HMG-CoA reductase is regulated by cholesterol levels with high concentrations of cholesterol leading to a shorter half-life. The final regulatory mechanism involves control of the expression of the HMG-CoA reductase gene. High levels of cholesterol lead to a decrease in the mRNA levels coding for HMG-CoA reductase.\n\n【7】**Question**: 34.2 You decide to treat a patient who has very high levels of serum cholesterol with the statin drug atorvastatin.

The first step in the biosynthesis of cholesterol is the condensation of 2 molecules of acetyl-CoA to form acetoacetyl-CoA. The addition of a third acetyl CoA molecule gives rise to HMG-CoA. HMG-CoA reductase is converted to mevalonate. HMG-CoA reductase is the target of the statin drugs and the substrate used by this enzyme is HMG-CoA.\n\n【14】**Question**: 34.3 Which of the following vitamins can be used in high doses to treat hypercholesterolemia?\n\n【15】A.

Niacin acts to decrease VLDL and LDL plasma levels. Its mechanism of action is not clearly understood but probably involves inhibition of VLDL secretion, which, in turn, decreases the production of LDL. Niacin inhibits the release of free fatty acids from adipose tissue, which leads to a decrease of free fatty acids entering the liver and decreased VLDL synthesis in the liver. This decreases the availability of VLDL for conversion to LDL (containing cholesterol esters). Niacin also increases HDL (the “good cholesterol”) by an unknown mechanism.\n\n【20】BIOCHEMISTRY PEARLS\n\n【21】 HMG-CoA reductase catalyzes the synthesis of mevalonate from HMG-CoA in an irreversible rate-limiting reaction.\n\n【22】 The enzyme 21-hydroxylase is required for the synthesis of mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids.\n\n【23】 The statins act as competitive inhibitors of the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

In addition to normal senescence of nail production within the nail matrix, exogenous factors play a major role in pathophysiology. Repetitive hand washing or chemical irritants (e.g. nail cosmetics) degrade nail integrity. The result is nail splitting along the free edge. It is important to rule out other nutritional deficiencies that can also lead to brittle nail disease. Examples might include iron (classically presents as ­koilonychia or spoon nails), biotin, or cysteine deficiency 删除10：<u>(Hochman et al. 1993 ; Scher & Daniel 1997 )</u>.\n\n【26】The mainstay of treatment is avoiding frequent hand washing with harsh detergents and avoiding manicures or nail cosmetics.

Sometimes infected nails can crumble, but they do not ­typically split only on the distal nail plate (onychoschizia) as in this case.\n\n【30】2.\n\n【31】Pterygium refers to abnormal adhesion of the nail plate to the surrounding nail apparatus. It can occur with fusion of the nail bed to the underside of the nail plate (ventral) or fusion of the proximal nail fold to the nail plate (dorsal). Lichen planus can cause dorsal pterygium or excessive nail roughness (trachyonychia) but not solely onychoschizia 删除10：<u>(Bolognia et al. 2008 )</u>.\n\n【32】3.\n\n【33】Psoriatic nail changes consist of pitting, oil spots, onychausis (nail thinning and excessive scale under nail plate) or onycholysis (separation of the nail plate off the nail bed).

Often, though not always, there is either family history of other cutaneous signs of psoriatic skin involvement.\n\n【34】4.\n\n【35】Median nail dystrophy is an idiopathic condition that leads to a longitudinal depression of the midline of the nail plate with radiating “fir tree” like horizontal depressions.

The breathless删除8：<u>￾</u>ness is intermittent. When the breathlessness comes on she feels unable to take air into her  删除换行 lungs, and is often unable to speak and finds that multiple doses of salbutamol provide little  删除换行 relief. She presents to the accident and emergency department with an acute exacerbation of  删除换行 her breathlessness.\n\n【4】Examination\n\n【5】She is unable to speak in more than a whisper.

Much the commonest cause of  删除换行 these symptoms would be asthma but there are a number of features which make this less  删除换行 likely in this patient.\n\n【18】Loss of voice is a prominent symptom. The history suggests little response to beta agonist  删除换行 treatment, and the lung function tests after recovery from the episode do not show airflow  删除换行 obstruction or a significant response to bronchodilators. The airway narrowing in asthma  删除换行 may be intermittent showing no obstruction between attacks, in which case it may be nec删除8：<u>￾</u>essary to look for increased bronchial responsiveness to a challenge such as exercise or  删除换行 inhaled methacholine.\n\n【19】During the acute episode in association with severe symptoms the oxygen saturation is,  删除换行 surprisingly, normal. Inability to speak in complete sentences is a characteristic of severe  删除换行 asthma but the loss of voice here suggests that there may be a problem at vocal cord level and  删除换行 this would fit with the marked inspiratory and expiratory wheezing and the feeling of being  删除换行 unable to take air into her lungs although asthmatics may complain of similar problems.\n\n【20】These features suggest that the diagnosis of vocal cord dysfunction is more likely than asthma  删除换行 in this woman. In this condition there is paradoxical motion of the vocal cords so that they  删除换行 adduct on inspiration to produce inspiratory airflow obstruction at the level of the larynx. \n\n【21】Episodes of breathlessness tend to be intermittent, unresponsive to conventional asthma  删除换行 treatment and associated with stridor.\n\n【22】The most important diagnostic tests are direct viewing of the cords by an ear nose and throat  删除换行 surgeon and a flow volume loop. Inspection of the cords will show paradoxical motion and  删除换行 adduction of the anterior cords with a posterior ‘glottis chink’ allowing limited airflow. A  删除换行 flow volume loop will show a relatively normal expiratory phase but loss of flow or low flow  删除换行 in the latter part of the inspiratory loop as the vocal cords adduct and produce obstruction \n\n【23】.

What kind of IV fluid would you use? What about muscle relaxants? Does the muscle relaxant effect of volatile agents potentiate the weakness of familial periodic paralysis?\n\n【11】5.  5.\n\n【12】    You are asked to sedate a patient with spinal muscular atrophy for a spinal tap . What is SMA? How is SMA treated?\n\n【13】6.  6.\n\n【14】    You are called to intubate an 18-year-old in the ICU. He has been in the ICU for a week following a flu shot, which resulted in progressive weakness—beginning with walking and now progressive respiratory failure. What is your diagnosis? NG tube feedings were stopped 1 hour ago. Should he be intubated awake? Would you perform?\n\n【15】Answers\n\n【16】1.  1.\n\n【17】    My preliminary diagnosis is pesticide toxicity as the child was likely present when spraying of the field took place. The pesticides are acetylcholinesterase enzymes that have two components. An acetylcholine molecule, bound at both ends to both sites of the enzyme, is cleaved in two to form acetic acid and choline. In organophosphate poisoning, an organophosphate binds to just one end of the acetylcholinesterase enzyme (the esteratic site), blocking its activity and causing an over-abundance of acetylcholine. I would offer cardiorespiratory support and symptomatic treatment.\n\n【18】    If organophosphate toxicity is suspected, decontamination is initiated. The patient’s clothing is removed and the intact skin cleansed gently with soap and water and ethyl alcohol (for intact skin), eyes are irrigated with saline, and clothing is disposed of as hazardous waste. Medical personnel decontaminating the patient should self-protect against accidental exposure to the pesticide dust by wearing protective gear (waterproof gowns, gloves such as neoprene, and eye wear protection). Yes, pralidoxime is a specific antidote to organophosphates. Pralidoxime is able to attach to the other half (the unblocked, anionic site) of the acetylcholinesterase enzyme. It then binds to the organophosphate, and changes its conformation, and loses its binding to the acetylcholinesterase enzyme. The conjoined poison/antidote then unbinds from the site and thus regenerates the enzyme, which is now able to function again. It is effective when administered within 48 hours of exposure. Diazepam is used to control CNS excitation and seizures. CNS outcomes are improved if seizures and excitation are controlled. If a plan is made to administer pralidoxime, the patient should receive atropine by repeated administration of 50 mcg/kg q 10–30 minutes to maintain a heart rate above 100 beats/minute.\n\n【19】2.  2.\n\n【20】    A major concern in adolescents with DMD is difficulty swallowing which may predispose them to aspiration during induction. Some patients may develop an enlarged and stiff tongue as a result of tongue muscle degeneration and replacement with fibro-fatty tissue. Awake tracheal intubation is not a preferable strategy for several reasons: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> most children at this age are anxious and will not be cooperative; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> stress-induced tachycardia and hypertension could be detrimental in DMD adolescents since cardiomyopathy is common and tachycardia may lead to decreased cardiac output or ischemia; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> gagging and coughing induced by awake intubation are likely to cause respiratory decompensation. No, a mask anesthetic is not indicated because a mask airway may be very difficult to maintain for the duration of surgery. Laryngeal mask airway should be used to secure ventilation and I would attempt tracheal intubation via the LMA with a fiberoptic scope. Patients with DMD are at risk for acute rhabdomyolysis in response to succinylcholine and (occasionally) with exposure to vapor inhalation anesthetics. It is wise to absolutely avoid any exposure to succinylcholine and vapor agents. Adequate depth of anesthesia should be maintained throughout the procedure to avoid myocardial decompensation and cardiac arrhythmias. No, laryngeal mask airway with spontaneous breathing is not a reasonable plan because the patient will likely not be able to maintain adequate tidal exchange due to severe restrictive chest wall disorder. This is particularly true with the use of IV anesthetics.\n\n【21】3.  3.\n\n【22】    CCD is a myopathy, inherited as an autosomal dominant disease. It is a congenital myopathy, often with a mild presentation early in life with variable severity. It arises from defects in the calcium channel that results in the release of calcium into the myoplasm, leading to muscle damage and weakness. Many patients with CCD may also carry the defective gene of the malignant hyperthermia syndrome (ryanodine allele on chromosome 19q13.1) on the same locus as the CCD gene. CCD is associated with congenital muscle weakness that causes scoliosis and spontaneous hip dislocation. Spinal anesthesia may aggravate an existing muscle weakness and hip dislocation. Yes, like multiple sclerosis, patients with adult onset CCD may experience transient worsening with intense activity. However in general, unlike other myopathies, exercise improves muscle strength. Normally, these children have normal intelligence.\n\n【23】4.  4.\n\n【24】    Familial periodic paralysis is an autosomal dominant inheritable disorder. Preoperative evaluation includes a family history of the disorder and symptoms the infant may have that would indicate symptomatic familial periodic paralysis. Usually the onset of the disorder is in the second decade of life. Symptoms include periodic swallowing, breathing, and limb weakness. ECG can be helpful during the acute episodes of the disorder and may change because of hypokalemia, prolonged PR interval >0.32 s, ST segment depression, T wave inversion, and a prominent U wave. Serum electrolytes are helpful during the acute episode and may show a low serum potassium. There are cases of normokalemic periodic paralysis . Normal serum potassium does not exclude the disorder because it is a self-limited disorder. Probably, glucose administrated should be limited because glycemic stimulation produces an insulin surge, with intracellular shifting of glucose and potassium, resulting in hypokalemia. I will use a nonglucose-containing solution such as normal saline or lactated Ringer’s solution for maintenance fluid therapy. It is advisable to avoid muscle relaxants unless necessary for the optimizing surgical exposure. Yes, volatile agents can potentiate skeletal muscle weakness.\n\n【25】5.  5.\n\n【26】    The disease is caused by degeneration of the anterior horn cells. The infantile form manifests within the first 3 months of life and is usually a severe form of the disease. Severe muscle weakness is associated with difficulty swallowing, secretion handling, and breathing. These infants are at risk for aspiration and may require postoperative ventilatory support. The Kugelberg-Welander disease is a milder form of the disease and progresses slower than the infantile form. Yes, this syndrome is associated with hypoplasia or agenesis of the cranial nerve nuclei in the brainstem. The cranial nerves are primarily motor nerves, and hence this syndrome is analogous to SMA syndrome because it involves lower motor neuron degeneration. Both conditions affect motor neurons. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis specifically affects the motor cortex, spinal motor neurons, or both. Unlike SMA, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis affects both the upper and lower motor neurons. It may manifest as spastic weakness as opposed to flaccid weakness in SMA syndrome . These patients have weak and atrophic muscles of respiration and may require ventilatory support postoperatively. They are at risk for aspiration pneumonitis and postoperative pneumonia due to inability to cough effectively from weakened bulbar reflexes. They are intolerant to sedative, hypnotics, and opioids due to reduced respiratory muscle reserve. Genetic counseling of the family is important to determine whether the disorder is a result of mutation or genetic deletion of survival motor neuron (SMN), which occurs in approximately 90–94% of SMA patients. Counseling is also necessary for prenatal screening with subsequent pregnancy; the screening test has 98% reliability. This information makes this SMN gene test very useful for the diagnosis of SMA. Anesthetic agent choices are made bearing in mind that patients with generalized muscle wasting are unable to protect airways and have limited respiratory system reserve. Therefore, these patients have increased sensitivity to nondepolarizing muscle relaxants and are unable to compensate for hypoventilation and decreased central respiratory drive following administration of CNS depressants such opioids for postoperative pain control. In the past several years, a promising treatment regimen involved the use of the drug nusinersen. This antisense oligonucleotide acts as a splicing modifier and changes the relative concentration of nonfunctional proteins that cause the disease. The drug must be delivered intrathecally. This can be challenging given the severe scoliosis that often characterizes these patients as they age.\n\n【27】6.  6.\n\n【28】    Possible etiologies include post-viral syndromes and metabolic or autoimmune disorders. Following a flu shot, the most likely etiology for this adolescent is Guillain-Barré syndrome. No, the patient should be anesthetized with ketamine or propofol if hemodynamically stable. If hemodynamically unstable, intubation can be achieved with IV midazolam and a low dose of etomidate. Yes, rapid sequence induction can be performed without the use of a muscle relaxant because the bulbar muscles are either paralyzed or weak enough from the disease to allow adequate rapid intubation condition. Succinylcholine should be avoided because in the acute phase of Guillain-Barré disease, there is an active demyelination process that likely predisposes to serious hyperkalemia.\n\n【29】Suggested Reading\n\n【30】1.

This pain initially began as a dull ache in the upper abdomen but then later localized in the right upper abdomen. Associated with the pain， the patient had nausea without vomiting. While in the emergency department， hersymptoms have improved somewhat after receiving a dose of parenteral analgesia. She describes having had similar pain episodes over the past several months， but the current episode is the worst. Her history is significant for type 2 diabetes controlled with diet only. Her temperature is37.8℃(100°℉)， with the remaining vital signs being normal. Her abdomen is non-distended， with some focal tenderness in the right upper quadrant. Her WBC count is 13，000/mm’， her serum glucose is 212 mg/dL， and the remainder ofher laboratory studies including chemistries， liver function tests， urinalysis， and amy-lase are within normal limits. The ultrasound of the right upper quadrant (RUQ) demonstrates multiple stones in the gallbladder， a thickened gallbladder wall， a small amount of fluid around the gallbladder， and a common bile duct (CBD) diameter of4.5 mm (normal<5mm).**\n\n【2】**What is the most likely diagnosis?**\n\n【3】**What is the best therapy for this patient?**\n\n【4】**What are the complications associated with this disease process?**\n\n【5】**ANSWERS TO CASE 32：**\n\n【6】**Gallstone Disease**\n\n【7】Summary： A 51-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes presents with 1-day history ofupper abdominal pain that began after a meal. Her history， physical examination， laboratory findings， ultrasound findings are suggestive of gallstone disease.\n\n【8】**Most likely diagnosis： Acute cholecystitis.**\n\n【9】Best therapy： Admission， IV fluids， IV antibiotics， followed rather quickly by laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). Surgery is the preferred treatment for a patient with normal life expectancy and no prohibitive risk for general anes-thesia and abdominal surgery.\n\n【10】Complications： Gallstone disease can include complications associated with the gallbladder (acute and/ or chronic cholecystitis)； complications related to the passage of stones from the gallbladder into the biliary duct (choledocholi-thiasis， cholangitis， and biliary pancreatitis)； or stone passage into the GI tract(gallstone ileus).\n\n【11】**ANALYSIS**\n\n【12】Objectives\n\n【13】1\\. Learn the causes of gallstone disease and learn to differentiate and treat biliary colic， acute cholecystitis， and chronic cholecystitis.\n\n【14】**2\\. Learn the diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for patients presenting with gallstone diseases.**\n\n【15】3\\. Learn the complications that can develop from gallstone disease.\n\n【16】**Consideration**\n\n【17】This patient's history of recurrent upper abdominal pain occurring following meals suggests that she may have been experiencing recurrent bouts of biliary colic over the past year. Currently， she indicates that the pain has been persistent for 1day， and more severe than prior episodes. Given her 24-hour duration of pain， low-grade fever， focal tenderness over the gallbladder， laboratory finding of leukocyto-sis， and sonographic findings of thickened gallbladder wall with peri-cholecystic fluid， her current clinical picture is most consistent with acute cholecystitis. With this diagnosis， the patient needs to be admitted to the hospital for monitoring， intravenous fluids， antibiotic treatment， and cholecystectomy during this hospital-ization. A factor that should prompt us to proceed with cholecystectomy as early as feasible is her history of type II diabetes mellitus. Diabetic patients are highly susceptible to develop stress-induced hyperglycemia， and with hyperglycemia， her leukocyte functions are compromised， thus increasing her risk of infectious com-plications from acute cholecystitis.\n\n【18】BILIARY COLIC： This describes the waxing and waning， poorly localized post-prandial upper abdominal pain that patients may have when their gallbladders are stimulated to contract but are unable to empty either because there is a gallstone obstruction at the gallbladder neck or cystic duct. Rarely， biliary colic can also be produced by cholecystokinin (CCK) stimulation of a dysfunctional gallbladder， such as in the case of biliary dyskinesia.\n\n【19】ACUTE CHOLECYSTITIS： In most patients， this infectious process occurs as the result of persistent obstruction of the cystic duct by a gallstone. When the obstructive process does not resolve spontaneously， bacterial infection can occur via the lymphatic channels. The most common organisms involved in acute cholecysti-tis are Escherichia coli， Klebsiella， Proteus， and Steptococcus faecalis. Patients present with persistent RUQ pain， with or without fever， focal gallbladder tenderness，mild leukocytosis or normal W BC count， and normal LFTs or nonspecific abnormalities in the LFTs. Treatment is NPO， intravenous antibiotics， and cholecystectomy dur-ing the hospitalization.\n\n【20】ACALCULOUS CHOLECYSTITIS： This condition involves gallbladder inflam-mation and infection secondary to biliary stasis. This type of cholecystitis is responsible for <5% of all patients with acute cholecystitis. Most often， affected individuals are hospitalized patients undergoing other medical treatments. Patients who are susceptible to this condition often have low perfusion states and are not taking an oral diet (classically， ICU patients receiving mechanical ventilation who are NPO and receiving vasoactive agents for blood pressure support). The NPO status contributes to GB distension， and with decrease perfusion， ischemic injury of the GB occurs along with bacterial infection.\n\n【21】CHRONIC CHOLECYSTITIS： This is produced by recurrent bouts of biliary colic and acute cholecystitis， which causes fibrosis and chronic inflammation of the GB. Most patients complain of long-standing history of postprandial RUQ pain with pain becoming more tolerable as the process continues over time. This change in pain pattern probably correlates with increasing fibrotic changes and decreasing inflammatory changes in the GB over the course of disease. Ultra-sound findings may reveal gallstones， thickened GB wall， and possibly a small， contracted GB.\n\n【22】CHOLANGITIS： This is a very serious infection within the bile ducts. It most commonly occurs in the setting of stones within the CBD causing either partial or completed obstruction of the CBD. Classically， Charcots Triad (fever， RUQ pain， and jaundice) is seen in about 70% of the patients. This condition can be serious and associated with sepsis， septic shock， and distant-organ dysfunction. Systemic manifestations of this illness occur because ascending infections in the biliary 删除换行 tree can cause activation of the Kupffer cells (hepatic macrophages) and produce systemic proinflammatory responses and multiple-organ-dysfunction syndrome. Patients suspected of having cholangitis should be hospitalized. Early treatments for these patients include close monitoring， resuscitation， early broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy， and biliary decompression. Reynolds pentad refers to the clinical picture produced by severe cholangitis (fever， abdominal pain， jaundice， shock， and altered mental status)， and patients presenting with this picture need aggressive supportive care， antibiotics， and urgent biliary decompression.\n\n【23】RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASONOGRAPHY： This imaging modality possesses 98% to 99% sensitivity in identifying gallstones in the GB. The examina-tion also helps identify the diameter ofthe CBD， which has a high negative-predictive value for common bile duct stones (CBDS) when the CBD is small (<5 mm).\n\n【24】BILIARYSCINTIGRAPHY： This is a nuclear medicine study involving intravenous injection of nuclear tracer that is taken up by the liver and excreted into the biliary system. Becase the patient with acute cholecystitis generally has obstruction of the cystic duct， this study can be used to determine if a patient has acute cholecystitis. Therefore the tracer will visualize the liver and extrahepatic biliary tree with subse-quent visualization of the duodenum， but the gallbladder is never visualized.\n\n【25】**MAGNETIC RESONANCE CHOLANGIOPANCREATOGRAPHY (MRCP)：**\n\n【26】This is an MRI study using a set of sequences that allows for imaging of the biliary ducts and pancreatic ducts. With this technique， stones and masses within these ducts will cause signal void and thus can be demonstrated. The sensitivity and spec-ificity of MRCP is nearly identical to that of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopan-creatography (ERCP)， but this technique cannot be utilized for intervention when CBDS are seen.\n\n【27】LAPAROSCOPIC CHOLECYSTECTOMY(LC)： This is a laparoscopic approach to the removal of the gallbladder. LCs are performed under general anesthesia in most cases. Commonly， three or four ports are placed with the introduction of a camera and instruments. Postoperatively， the majority of patients either go home the same day or the next day. Most patients are able to return to work or normal daily activities within a few days. During LC， cholangiography can be performed by inserting a catheter through the cystic duct and injecting contrast to visualize stones or abnormalities in the biliary tree.\n\n【28】**ENDOSCOPICRETROGRADE CHOLANGIOPANCREATOGRAPHY(ERCP)：**\n\n【29】Using the side-viewing flexible endoscope， the ampulla of Vater can be visualized and canalized， thus allowing for contrast injection and visualization of the CBD and pancreatic duct. Through the working channel of the scope， baskets， balloons， and snares can be inserted to help with the extraction of stones and biopsy oftissue.\n\n【30】COMMON BILE DUCT EXPLORATION (CBDE)： This is a direct exploration of the CBD by either open surgery or the laparoscopic approach. The goal in most cases is to remove CBDS in the bile ducts. CBDE is not commonly done unless less invasive means to remove the CBDS (such as by ERCP) are unsuccessful or unavailable.\n\n【31】Pathophysiology\n\n【32】At least 16 million Americans have gallstones， and 800，000 new cases occur each year. Gallstone types are categorized as cholesterol stones， black pigment stones， and brown pigment stones. Cholesterol stones make up majority of the gallstones(80%) in Western populations. Cholesterol stone development is predisposed by an imbalance of cholesterol to bile acid ratio in the bile. When this biochemical imbalance exists in the bile， the bile is lithogenic and the patient is susceptible to cholesterol stone formation in the gallbladder. Stone formation requires an acti-vation process that is contributed to by defects within the gall bladder mucosa； therefore， cholesterol stones only form in the gallbladder when there is underlying GB dysfunction. For patients with cholesterol stone disease， if the GB is removed with all the stones， the patient should become free from further stone recurrences.\n\n【33】There are many people with gallstones who remain asymptomatic but for rea-sons that are unknown， approximately 15% to 20% of patients with gallstones will develop symptoms (biliary colic). Once a patient develops symptoms， he/ she is then at risk for subsequent complications related to the gallstones(eg， cholecystitis， biliary pancreatitis， choledocholithiasis， and cholangitis).\n\n【34】**Patient Evaluation and Treatment**\n\n【35】The evaluation for every patient suspected of gallstone disease should include a history， physical examination，a complete blood count， liver function studies， serum amylase，and a RUQ ultrasound. If the patient with gallstones does not have symp-toms or complications that can be attributed to the stones， no treatment is nec-essary. For patients with symptoms， it is important to differentiate whether the patient has simply biliary colic or GB complications (ie， cholecystitis， choledo-cholithiasis， biliary pancreatitis， or cholangitis). Frequently， those with gallstone complications need hospitalization， antibiotics， and possibly additional diagnos-tic studies， and/ or interventions such as ERCP with endoscopic sphincterotomy. As outlined in Table 32-1， there are subtle differences in the history and physical examinations， laboratory findings， and ultrasound findings that may suggest that a patient may have a CBDS. The frequency of finding CBDS concurrently in a patient under evaluation for cholecystectomy is reported to range from 8% to 20%， and the probability of concurrent CBDS varies greater depending on the patient s clinical presentations. Dilatation of the CBD (>5mm) with elevation in LFTs (eg， bilirubin， alkaline phosphatase， AST， and ALT) should raise the concern for com-mon bile duct stones. When the suspicion is high， the patients should undergo an ERCP to evaluate the CBD prior to or after the completion of cholecystectomy. For patients in whom there is a moderate suspicion (30%-50% probability) for CBDS (such as a patient with cholecystitis or biliary pancreatitis with CBD >5mm and LFT elevations)， an MRCP can be performed to rule out CBDS； if CBDS are visualized then an ERCP can be performed for duct clearance. It is important to consider that because stones can pass from the GB to the CBD at any time. When-ever a patient with cholelithiasis develops new symptoms or a change in the clinical picture， laboratory and ultrasound reassessment are needed to make sure that there\n\n| **Table 32-1·GALLSTONE DISEASE PRESENTATIONS**  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Disease**  | **Symptoms**  | **Physical Examination**  | **Ultrasonography**  | **Laboratory Studies**  |\n| **Biliary colic**  | **Postprandial pain，usually<6 h in duration**  | **Afebrile， mild tenderness overgallbladder**  | **Gallstones in gallbladder but no wallthickening，no CBD dilation**  | **Normal WBC count，normal LFTvalues，normal serum amylase level**  |\n| **Acute cholecystitis**  | **Persistent epigastric orRUQ pain lasting >8h**  | **May be febrile or afebrile；usually localized gallbladdertenderness**  | **Gallstones in gallbladder；may havepericholecystic fluid； may or may nothave CBD dilation**  | **Normal or elevated WBC count；may have normal or mildly** **elevated LFT values**  |\n| **Chronic cholecystitis**  | **Persistent recurrent RUQpain**  | **Afebrile； may have localizedtenderness over a palpablegallbladder**  | **Stones in gallbladder， thickenedgallbladder wall； in advanced casescontracted gallbladder**  | **Normal WBC count； may have mildelevation in LFTvalues**  |\n| **Choledocholithiasis**  | **Postprandial abdominalpain that improves withfasting**  | **May or may not be clinicallyjaundiced； nonspecific RUQabdominaltenderness**  | **Gallstones in gallbladder；CBD usuallydilated**  | **Elevation in LFT values； the patternofelevation is dependent on thechronicity and partial vs complete** **obstruction**  |\n| **Biliary pancreatit is**  | **Persistent epigastric andback pain**  | **Epigastric tenderness to deeppalpation is present**  | **Gallstones in gallbladder； CBD dilationmay occur because ofpancreatitis** **(does not always indicate CBD stones)**  | **Leukocytosis，serum amylase levelfrequently>1000 U/L，LFT valuesmay be transiently elevated， butpersistence may indicate CBDstones**  |\n\n【37】**Abbreviations： CBD， common bile duct； IFT， liver function test； RUQ， right upper quadrant； WBC， white blood cell.**\n\n【38】are no CBD S present. Complications of undiagnosed and untreated CBDS include cholangitis， pancreatitis， and biliary cirrhosis.\n\n【39】Whether a routine intraoperative cholangiogram should be done during every LC has been a controversial topic among surgeons. The proponents for routine cholangiography believe that this procedure helps to clarify the biliary tract anat-omy， and minimizes inadvertent operative injuries. Opponents to routine intraop-erative cholangiography believe that because the rate of injuries is so low during elective cases (0.2%-0.5%) that cholangiography during every LC contributes to extended operating times and wasted resources.\n\n【40】Biliary Pancreatitis\n\n【41】Priorities for patients who present with acute biliary pancreatitis include the deter-mination of pancreatitis severity， and the provision of monitoring and supportive care. The majority of patients with biliary pancreatitis have a short disease course and recover within hours to days. Biliary pancreatitis patients with sonographic CBD measurements <5 mm and rapid clinical resolution have only a 1-2%risk of CBDS therefore no additional diagnostic studies to look for CBDS are necessary. When patients present with biliary pancreatitis， they should have cholecystectomy performed during the same hospitalization， because delayed LC for these patients is associated with recurrent pancreatitis， greater morbidity， and increased treat-ment costs. Clinical evidence suggests that patients presenting with mild cases of biliary pancreatitis (<3 Ranson’s criteria) can safely undergo LC within 48 hours of admission. Furthermore， for patients with biliary pancreatitis， it is safe to pro-ceed with LC once their pain and symptoms resolve， and it is unnecessary to wait for normalization of the serum amylase and lipase. The optimal timing for LC in patients presenting with severe pancreatitis with complications remains unclear， and those patients should be managed on a case by case basis.\n\n【42】**CASE CORRELATION**", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Laboratory samples were taken during his examination and revealed very low blood glucose levels and elevated serum ketone levels.\n\n【2】17.1 Which of the following is the most probable cause of the elevated ketone and low glucose readings?\n\n【3】A.

Neuronal and glial metabolism is reduced\n\n【13】17.3 The patient is treated by IV thiamine and glucose solutions. Although the patient appears to be improving, ketone test strip analysis indicates an increase in urinary ketones. This is best explained by which of the following?\n\n【14】A. Conversion of β-hydroxybutyrate to acetoacetate\n\n【15】B. Decreased activity of the TCA cycle\n\n【16】C. Increased catabolism of ketogenic amino acids\n\n【17】D. Inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase\n\n【18】E. Conversion of lactate to pyruvate\n\n【19】**Answer**: \n17.1 B. Increased pyruvate carboxylase would favor increased gluconeogenesis. Increased protein mobilization would also favor an increase in glucose synthesis. Increasing the flux of acetyl CoA through the TCA cycle would decrease the production of ketone bodies. A lack of adequate nutrition due to nausea and vomiting as a result of excessively consuming alcohol would lead to low blood glucose. Gluconeogenesis is slowed due a high NADH/NAD <sup>+ </sup> , but fatty acids continue to be oxidized to elevate ketone body production.\n\n【20】17.2 E. None of the first 4 alternatives affects brain function. Neurons and glia require glucose as the sole source for energy production. With low blood glucose as a result of repressed gluconeogenesis, neurons and glia lack the energy that is required for function.\n\n【21】17.3 A. The increase in ketone bodies detected by ketone test strips is most likely due to conversion of β-hydroxybutyrate to acetoacetate as the NADH/NAD <sup>+ </sup> returns to normal levels. Treatment with IV glucose solutions will resolve the low concentration of blood glucose, which will decrease the need for β-oxidation of fatty acids and the production acetyl CoA, ketone bodies, and NADH. As the NADH/NAD <sup>+ </sup> decreases, the equilibrium between acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate shifts toward acetoacetate.\n\n【22】**Question**: 17.4 Alcohol metabolism is accomplished in various cellular compartments including the cytosol, mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum. Which reaction is least likely to inhibit the synthesis of glucose?\n\n【23】A. Ethanol → Acetaldehyde by cytosolic alcohol dehydrogenase\n\n【24】B. Ethanol → Acetaldehyde by the microsomal ethanol oxidizing system\n\n【25】C. Acetaldehyde → Acetic acid by mitochondrial acetaldehyde dehydrogenase\n\n【26】D. β-Hydroxybutyrate → Acetoacetate\n**Answer**: 17.4 B. The conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase, acetaldehyde to acetic acid, and β-hydroxybutyrate to acetoacetate all produce NADH + H <sup>+ </sup> as products. Increased NADH/NAD+ inhibits those reactions that require NAD+ as an electron acceptor. Several reactions in gluconeogenesis require NAD+; therefore, these reactions would be inhibited by low NAD+. The MEOS does not produce NADH; rather, it requires NADPH as a source of reducing equivalents. Thus, oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde by the MEOS would not inhibit gluconeogenesis.\n\n【27】BIOCHEMISTRY PEARLS\n\n【28】 Poor nutrition and decreased carbohydrate consumption leads to an increase in glucagon secretion and decreased insulin secretion.\n\n【29】 The increased \\[NADH\\]/\\[NAD <sup>+ </sup> \\] from alcohol metabolism impairs gluconeogenesis by inhibiting the conversion of lactate to pyruvate and glycerol to DHAP.\n\n【30】 Compared with DKA, glucose levels in AKA are low.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

It arises from the epithelium located between the sebaceous gland and the arrector pili muscle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Pilar cyst is lined by stratified squamous epithelium without a granular cell layer and is filled with keratin. It is most commonly observed in young women. Family history may be present since the disease follows autosomal dominant inheritance in some cases. Clinically, pilar cyst presents as a flesh-colored, smooth, movable, firm, and well-circumscribed nodule. In case of long duration, hair loss on the skin surface immediately above the cyst may be presented. Most commonly, they are multiple lesions, but sometimes, single lesion might be presented. Pilar cyst usually occurs in areas with dense hair follicle especially the scalp, but they may also be found on the face, head, and neck. It is usually asymptomatic. Calcification or eruption lead to inflammatory process and cause pain in the affected area. Diagnosis of pilar cysts is mainly based on the clinical picture. Radiological studies sometimes are needed to exclude other differentials and determine the extent of the lesion. A histopathological examination is characterized by the presence of epithelial lined cyst filled with brightly eosinophilic keratinaceous debris. In case of focal rupture of the cyst, giant cell reaction may be presented. The treatment is a radical surgical excision of the lesion including the wall of the cysts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】Pilar cyst should be differentiated from furuncle, lipoma and skin metastasis.\n\n【26】Furuncle is a common bacterial infection of the hair follicle with purulent extension into the adjacent subcutaneous tissue leading to abscess formation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The most common infectious agent is _Staphylococcus aureus_ , but other bacteria may also be causative. Furuncle presents as a red, swollen, and tender nodule. Fever and enlarged lymph nodes are rarely observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Furuncle may occur on any hair-bearing area. However, it most frequently appears on the extremities.

The infant was fussy the past few days, would not take a bottle, and this morning was difficult to wake. The infant is under custody of the grandmother who is unsure of her perinatal course.History of Present Illness\n--------------------------\n\n【5】This 9‐day‐old infant became ill‐appearing within the last 24 hours, was initially irritable and poorly consoled, progressing to poor oral intake, and inciting concern for the caregiver. Temperature was not taken at home. There is no report of cough, runny nose, difficulty breathing, wheezing or other respiratory symptoms. Grandmother feels the infant looks pale. The infant is having soft bowel movements and no excess spitting.Past Medical History\n--------------------\n\n【6】Previous hospital records reveal that this infant was born at 36.4 weeks’ gestation. At birth, she was appropriate for gestational age, in the 40th percentile for weight and length, with birthweight of 2.86 kg. She was delivered via uncomplicated vaginal delivery but admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit because of the mother’s known substance abuse and concern for neonatal abstinence syndrome. She has had first hepatitis B vaccine, vitamin K injection, and first metabolic screening completed.Family History\n--------------\n\n【7】This infant was discharged home to the maternal grandmother; mother incarcerated; father’s history is unknown and he is not involved with the mother or infant.Current Status\n--------------\n\n【8】On arrival to the ED, the infant is extremely lethargic, with pediatric Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 6 . Her initial vital signs include temperature 35.1°C (95.2°F), heart rate 68 bpm, respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute which are very shallow, blood pressure 65/32 mmHg, and oxygen saturation with use of non‐rebreather mask 88%. The infant is intubated and mechanically ventilated due to mental status and poor respiratory effort. Complete blood count (CBC), basic metabolic panel (BMP), C‐reactive protein (CRP), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies including cell count, Gram stain, and blood, urine and CSF cultures are obtained, with herpes simplex virus (HSV) PCR. Results for CBC, BMP and CSF analysis are shown in Tables 90.2 – 90.4 . CRP level is 234 mg/dL and initial lactate level 7.5 mmol/L.\n\n【9】Head computed tomography (CT) is obtained prior to lumbar puncture to assess the presence of increased intracranial pressure.

After cultures were obtained, she had ampicillin and cefotaxime administered in the ED and was given a 10 mL/kg fluid bolus.Rationale and Evidence‐based Practice Explanation\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】### Based on the data, what are the differential diagnoses and the most likely diagnosis for this child?\n\n【22】Differential diagnoses for this child include non‐accidental trauma, inborn errors of metabolism, and infectious etiology including but not limited to sepsis, bacteremia and meningitis. The most likely diagnosis for this child is neonatal sepsis due to the child’s history and presenting symptoms of hypothermia, hypoglycemia, irritability progressing to lethargy, decreased oral intake, and initial laboratory findings. Meningitis is unlikely with normal CSF results, but cultures are still pending. This child also has an unclear perinatal history and the maternal health status at the time of birth is unknown, so maternal infection may be a possibility and typical neonatal organisms include group B _Streptococcus_ , _Escherichia coli_ , _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ , and _Listeria monocytogenes_ . In viral pathogenesis, herpes simplex virus (HSV)‐1 and HSV‐2 can cause neonatal meningitis, although HSV‐2 accounts for 70% of cases.\n\n【23】Late‐onset neonatal sepsis or bacteremia occurs in infants greater than 72 hours old and can still reflect bacterial organisms present in early‐onset neonatal infection. Organisms can be transferred through an ascending pathway from mother to infant or through ruptured membranes. Neonatal sepsis is associated with high risk of morbidity and mortality. The risk of sepsis increases in a neonate whose mother had fever, lack of prenatal care, premature labor, premature rupture of membranes, group B _Streptococcus_ colonization, urinary tract infection, and others.\n\n【24】Sepsis is invasion by microbial pathogens, characterized by a proinflammatory response that can lead to severe sepsis and septic shock. In neonates, cytokines are regulators of sepsis. Interleukin (IL)‐6 is a cytokine which is evident in the neonatal population, and shows early response to infection, preceding the increase in CRP. IL‐6 acts as a signal in the activation of T cells, and induces the secretion of antibodies by B cells and the differentiation of T cells. It stimulates the release of other cytokines, increasing several hours before the increase in CRP. These regulators have high sensitivity and are capable of effective defense against pathogens; however, cytokines can dysregulate the immune response and ultimately promote tissue damage. There is a fine line here, between repair and improvement and further demise within the infectious cascade.\n\n【25】### Given the most likely diagnosis, what is the initial pharmacologic therapy?\n\n【26】Neonates admitted from the community are at lower risk for infection caused by multidrug‐resistant pathogens than infants who have been hospitalized since birth. The combination of ampicillin plus gentamicin or ampicillin plus a third‐generation cephalosporin (e.g. cefotaxime) are regimens for empiric treatment of sepsis without an apparent focus of infection, as in this setting. It is also recommended to treat for HSV with acyclovir when the patient is a neonate or young infant and recent maternal screens are not available, or there is fever present. This patient will also require fluid resuscitation and electrolyte supplementation. Placement of a central venous line to administer inotropic/vasopressor infusion and fluid boluses may be necessary and an arterial line may be needed to monitor blood pressure and obtain blood gases.\n\n【27】### What medications to treat HSV would be indicated?\n\n【28】Empiric therapy with acyclovir is definitely recommended for children with CSF abnormalities and who have encephalitis or focal findings on examination, imaging, or electroencephalography. However, a body of research strongly suggests that an infant who is treated for sepsis should also receive acyclovir until the CSF PCR for HSV returns negative. Clinical features suggestive of HSV infection include mucocutaneous vesicles, seizures, lethargy, respiratory distress, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, blood oozing from intravascular catheter sites, hypothermia, sepsis‐like illness, hepatomegaly, ascites, or elevated transaminases.\n\n【29】### What additional diagnostic studies would be warranted at this time?\n\n【30】Obtaining coagulation studies is important to assist in determining if the infant may be experiencing disseminated intravascular coagulation, which is a concern for any patient who is septic. If the infant remains stable and is able to wean and tolerate extubation without any alterations in hemodynamic status, routine monitoring of electrolytes would continue until feedings are on board. It is also important to monitor lactate and CRP levels to ensure that they are decreasing. Evidence regarding mortality in neonates with sepsis indicates that high CRP and lactate levels are associated with higher risks of death, especially if levels do not decrease. Following cultures and identification of organisms will document definitive treatment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

This is not  删除换行 a combined microcytic and macrocytic anaemia, as her folate and B12 levels are normal. \n\n【37】The blood film shows polychromasia . This is a result of excessive reticulocytes,  删除换行 which are the cells that precede mature red cells in the maturation stages.

This is a common problem in busy departments where doctors  删除换行 are expected to make decisions quickly. The diagnosis in this patient is haemolysis, and giv删除8：<u>￾</u>ing a blood transfusion to such patients would not correct the pathology. It is likely that the  删除换行 two units of transfusion that were given overnight were simply consumed by the haemolytic  删除换行 process; hence the patient’s haemoglobin levels remained the same. \n删除3：<u>Figure 72.1 Blood film showing polychromasia, thrombocytosis and some nucleated red </u>\n\n【40】cells. Case 72: Anaemia Resistant to a Blood Transfusion 209 \n\n【41】Haemolysis can be immune or non-immune mediated. The non-immune destruction of red  删除换行 cells can be mechanical, physical, chemical or associated with infections. Immune-mediated  删除换行 haemolysis is caused by antibodies produced against a person’s own red cells (autoimmune) or  删除换行 towards antigens introduced to the person’s body. These antigens can be introduced by drugs  删除换行 or via a blood transfusion (donor red cells). \n\n【42】The autoimmune haemolysis can be caused by antibodies active in warm temperature (warm删除8：<u>￾</u>acting antibodies) or at cold temperatures (cold-acting antibodies). Warm autoimmune hae删除8：<u>￾</u>molytic anaemia is the most common form of immune haemolytic anaemia. The diagnosis  删除换行 is confirmed using the Coombs’ test, also called the direct antiglobulin test (DAT). This test  删除换行 detects the antibodies bound to the surface of the red cells, and these antibodies can then be  删除换行 analysed. Haemolysis usually takes place at the spleen, hence the spleen enlargement. As the  删除换行 red cells coated with antibodies pass through the spleen, they are taken up and destroyed by  删除换行 macrophages. These cells have Fc receptors for the antibodies coating the red cells. \n\n【43】To confirm haemolysis, the following tests are needed: \n\n【44】• Blood film \n\n【45】• Bilirubin \n\n【46】• DAT \n\n【47】• LDH \n\n【48】• Haptoglobin \n\n【49】• Reticulocyte count \n\n【50】The first step in the management is to stabilise the patient. Given that she had a low blood  删除换行 pressure and tachycardia, fluid resuscitation has to be started as soon as possible. Once diag删除8：<u>￾</u>nosis is confirmed using the above tests, the definitive treatment for autoimmune haemolytic  删除换行 anaemia needs to be given in the form of immunosuppression (usually starting with high删除8：<u>￾</u>dose steroids, which are tapered once the patient is responding). \n\n【51】For patients who do not respond to steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) should be  删除换行 used. IVIg is thought to work by saturating the Fc receptors of the spleen macrophages, thus  删除换行 preventing the uptake and destruction of red cells. \n\n【52】It is worth noting that warm autoimmune haemolysis can be associated with other autoim删除8：<u>￾</u>mune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or lymphoproliferative condi删除8：<u>￾</u>tions such as lymphoma. Thus a careful assessment of the patient is needed to exclude other  删除换行 diagnoses. \n\n【53】KEY POINTS \n\n【54】• Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia can be precipitated by infections. \n\n【55】• Careful review of the anaemia screen helps to guide treatment and prevents  删除换行 unnecessary blood transfusion. \n\n【56】• The haemolysis screen involves blood film, bilirubin, DAT, LDH, haptoglobin and  删除换行 a reticulocyte count. \n\n【57】• Knowledge of the haemolysis screen avoids delays in the diagnosis.  \n\n【58】 ", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Up to 90% of acute diarrhea is infectious in etiology. He does not have any history compatible with chronic diarrhea, causes of which include Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, gluten intolerance, irritable bowel syndrome, and parasites. He had been in Mexico recently, which predisposes him to different pathogens: _E coli, Campylobacter, Shigella, Salmonella_ , and _Giardia_ . He does not have bloody stools. The presence of blood in the stool would suggest an invasive bacterial infection , such as hemorrhagic or enteroinvasive _E coli_ species, _Yersinia_ species, _Shigella_ , and _Entamoeba histolytica_ .\n\n【19】Examination of the stool for leukocytes is a simple, inexpensive test that helps to differentiate between the types of infectious diarrhea. If leukocytes are present in the stool, the suspicion is higher for _Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia_ , enterohemorrhagic and enteroinvasive _E coli, Clostridium difficile, Campylobacter_ , and _E histolytica_ . In general, ova and parasite evaluation is unhelpful, unless the history strongly points toward a parasitic source or the diarrhea is prolonged.\n\n【20】The majority of the diarrheas are viral, self-limited, and do not need further evaluation. In this particular patient, because of his recent travel to Mexico, traveler’s diarrhea should be strongly considered and treated with the appropriate antibiotic.\n\n【21】### APPROACH TO:  \nAcute Diarrhea\n\n【22】### DEFINITIONS\n\n【23】ACUTE DIARRHEA: Diarrhea present for less than 2-week duration\n\n【24】CHRONIC DIARRHEA: Diarrhea present for longer than 4-week duration\n\n【25】DIARRHEA: Passage of abnormally liquid or poorly formed stool in increased frequency (three or more times a day)\n\n【26】SUBACUTE DIARRHEA: Diarrhea present for 2- to 4-week duration\n\n【27】### CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【28】#### _Etiologies_\n\n【29】Approximately 90% of acute diarrhea is caused by infectious etiologies, with the remainder caused by medications, ischemia, and toxins. Infectious etiologies often depend on the patient population. Travelers to Mexico will frequently contract enterotoxigenic _E coli_ as a causative agent. Traveler’s diarrhea is a common entity and can be induced by a variety of bacteria, viruses, and parasites . Campers are often affected by _Giardia_ .\n删除4：<u>Table 10–1 • COMMON ETIOLOGIES OF TRAVELER’S DIARRHEA</u>\n\n【30】Consumption of foods is also frequently a culprit. _Salmonella_ or _Shigella_ can be found in undercooked chicken , enterohemorrhagic _E coli_ from undercooked hamburger, and _Staphylococcus aureus_ or _Salmonella_ from mayonnaise . Raw seafood may harbor _Vibrio, Salmonella_ , or hepatitis A. Sometimes the timing of the diarrhea following food ingestion is helpful. For example, illness within 6 hours of eating a salad containing mayonnaise suggests _S aureus_ , within 8 to 12 hours suggests _Clostridium perfringens_ , and within 12 to 14 hours suggests _E coli_ .\n\n【31】Daycare settings are particularly common for _Shigella, Giardia_ , and rotavirus to be transmitted. Patients in nursing homes, or who were recently in the hospital, may develop _C difficile_ colitis from antibiotic use.\n\n【32】#### _Clinical Presentation_\n\n【33】Most patients with acute diarrhea have self-limited processes and do not require much workup . Exceptions to this rule include profuse diarrhea, dehydration, fever exceeding 100.4°F (38.0°C), bloody diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, duration of the diarrhea for more than 48 hours, and children, elderly patients, and immunocompromised patients. Traveler’s diarrhea is characterized by greater than three loose stools in a 24-hour period accompanied by abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, fever, or tenesmus. Most cases occur within the first 2 weeks of travel.\n\n【34】Past and recent medical history should include exposures to medications and foods, travel history, and coworkers, classmates, or family members with similar symptoms. A history of a viral illness may provide a clue to the etiology. The initial evaluation should determine if the patient can tolerate oral intake. The patient who is both vomiting and having diarrhea is more prone to dehydration and more likely to need hospital admission for IV hydration.\n\n【35】The physical examination should focus on the vital signs, clinical impression of the volume status, and abdominal examination. Volume status is determined by observing whether the mucous membranes are moist or dry, the skin has good turgor, and the capillary refill is normal or delayed. The principal laboratory test is the stool for microscopic and microbiologic examination; usually it is sent for culture, but these results generally require several days to obtain and are not useful in the acute setting. Ova and parasite evaluation is generally unhelpful, except in selected circumstances of very high suspicion. Stool for _C difficile_ toxin may yield the etiology in patients who develop symptoms after antibiotic use. Although classically associated with clindamycin, any antibiotic can cause pseudomembranous colitis . A complete blood count, electrolytes, and renal function tests are sometimes indicated.\n\n【36】#### _Treatment_\n\n【37】Most cases of diarrhea resolve spontaneously in a few days without treatment . Replacement of fluids and electrolytes is the first step in treating the consequences of acute diarrhea. For mildly dehydrated individuals who can tolerate oral fluids, solutions such as the World Health Organization oral rehydration solution or commercially available drinks such as Pedialyte or Gatorade, often are all that is needed. Those with more serious volume deficits, elderly patients, and infants generally require hospitalization and intravenous hydration. If a parasitic infection is the cause of the diarrhea, prescription antibiotics may ease the symptoms. Antibiotics sometimes, but not always, help ease symptoms of bacterial diarrhea. However, antibiotics will not help viral diarrhea, which is the most common kind of infectious diarrhea. Over-the-counter antimotility or antisecretory medications may help to slow down the frequency of the stools, but they do not speed the recovery. Certain infections may be made worse by over-the-counter medications because they prevent your body from getting rid of the organism that is causing the diarrhea. Probiotics, supplements that contain live organisms such as _Lactobacillus_ sp or _Saccharomyces Boulardii_ , may reduce the incidence of antibiotic-related diarrhea and the duration/severity of all-cause infectious diarrhea (Level A recommendation).\n\n【38】#### _Prevention_\n\n【39】Hand washing is a simple and effective way to prevent the spread of viral diarrhea . Adults, children, and clinic and hospital personnel should be encouraged to wash their hands. Because viral diarrhea spreads easily, children with diarrhea should not attend school or child care until their illness has resolved.\n\n【40】To prevent diarrhea caused by contaminated food, use dairy products that have been pasteurized. Serve food immediately or refrigerate it after it has been cooked. Do not leave food out at room temperature because it promotes the growth of bacteria.\n\n【41】Travelers to locations, such as developing countries, where there is poor sanitation and frequent contamination of food and water, need to be cautious to reduce their risk of developing diarrhea. They should be advised to eat hot and well-cooked foods, and to drink bottled water, soda, wine, or beer served in its original container. Avoid drinks served over ice. Beverages from boiled water, such as coffee and tea, are usually safe. Recommend the use of bottled water even for teeth brushing. Also recommend avoiding raw fruits and vegetables unless they are peeled by the consumer immediately before being eaten. Patients should avoid tap water and ice cubes. In all, these recommendations may reduce but not completely eliminate one’s risk of developing traveler’s diarrhea.\n\n【42】#### _Traveler’s Prophylaxis and Treatment_\n\n【43】The best method for preventing traveler’s diarrhea (TD) is to avoid contaminated food and water . Antibiotic prophylaxis is not indicated unless the patient is at increased risk for complications from diarrhea or dehydration, such as underlying inflammatory bowel disease, renal disease, or an immunocompromised state. Fluoroquinolones are typically used for prophylaxis.\n\n【44】When antibiotics are indicated, therapy with a quinolone antibiotic should be started as soon as possible after the diarrhea begins. Most commonly, ciprofloxacin (500 mg twice daily) is given for 1 or 3 days . Quinolones cannot be used in children or pregnant women. Quinolones will resolve the diarrheal symptoms in the majority of patients within 1 day. Azithromycin , given as a single 1000-mg dose in adults or 10 mg/kg daily for 3 days in children, is another effective drug for the treatment of TD. Azithromycin also can be used in pregnant women with traveler’s diarrhea. Rifaximin given as 200 mg three times a day for 3 days can be used in TD caused by noninvasive strains of _E coli_ . However, Rifaximin is not effective against infections associated with fever or blood in the stool.\n\n【45】Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and ampicillin were popular drugs used in the past to treat TD, but increased resistance limits their use at this time. Bismuth subsalicylate is not recommended because, to be effective, it needs to be taken in large amounts (2 fl oz four times daily for up to 3 weeks) that can cause salicylate toxicity especially in persons taking anticoagulants or other salicylates. Bismuth subsalicy-late should also be avoided in persons allergic to aspirin, pregnant women, or those taking methotrexate, probenecid, or doxycycline for malaria prophylaxis. The evidence is insufficient regarding the efficacy of probiotics as prophylaxis for TD.\n\n【46】###", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Elsewhere on the trunk and limbs there are healing crusted lesions  删除换行 and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. He is now apyrexial and has normal blood  删除换行 pressure and pulse rate. \n\n【7】INVESTIGATIONS\n\n【8】Full blood count, renal and liver function tests were normal.\n\n【9】Skin swabs were taken for microbiology and virology cultures.\n\n【10】Questions\n\n【11】• Why do blisters form?\n\n【12】• What is the differential diagnosis?\n\n【13】• Who else may be affected?\n删除3：<u>Figure 69.1156</u>\n\n【14】ANSWER 69\n\n【15】Blisters (vesicles and bullae) are usually a sign of an acute cutaneous reaction. Blisters  删除换行 comprise clear, serous fluid, which may become cloudy due to the accumulation of neu删除8：<u>￾</u>trophils (pus), or blood-stained due to vascular damage. Blisters can form due to damage  删除换行 to the adhesion structures in between cells; this damage can result from friction/pressure,  删除换行 heat, infections, autoimmune-mediated complexes, phototoxic reactions, adverse drug  删除换行 reactions, and congenital deficiencies or malfunction of adhesion structures within the  删除换行 skin. Blisters can also form due to cutaneous oedema.\n\n【16】This child has bullous impetigo, which results from a cutaneous infection with exotoxin删除8：<u>￾</u>producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus (confirmed by skin swabs). Exotoxins cause  删除换行 loss of cell–cell adhesion in the epidermis, resulting in superficial blisters which break  删除换行 down, leaving denuded areas and classic golden crusting. Impetigo is very common,  删除换行 especially in children, and is highly contagious with spread by direct inoculation. The  删除换行 initial infection may occur through a small break in the skin – this child had resolving  删除换行 chickenpox lesions which left his skin vulnerable to secondary bacterial infection. Other  删除换行 family members are commonly subsequently infected by contact with the index case. \n\n【17】Classically, impetigo develops rapidly on localized areas of skin. Blisters, pustules,  删除换行 erosions and golden crusted exudate complete the clinical picture. Patients are usually  删除换行 otherwise well. Skin swabs may isolate S. aureus or occasionally Streptococcus (group A). \n\n【18】Localized cutaneous impetigo can be managed with topical antiseptics such as dilute  删除换行 chlorhexidine to wash the skin and topical antibiotics such as fusidic acid, polymyxin  删除换行 or mupirocin. Oral antibiotics such as flucloxacillin or erythromycin may be required if  删除换行 involvement is more widespread.\n\n【19】 KEY POINTS\n\n【20】• Blisters indicate an acute cutaneous reaction. \n\n【21】• Impetigo is common and highly contagious. \n\n【22】• Patients with localized disease may be managed with topical antibiotics.删除5：<u>157</u>\nQuestions\n\n【23】• What is the diagnosis?\n\n【24】• What is the likely underlying cause?\n\n【25】• What treatment would you initiate?", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Is what happens“in the mind\" really imaginary? And if it is imaginary， does that mean that this is not a psychic reality that can change thoughts， behaviours，and emotions?\n\n【2】What I will now be considering is how to address these problems in a medical and scientific way. For a psychosomatician psychoanalyst， there is a psychic reality and， as I have shown in the previous cases， we are dealing with some extremely complex problems.\n\n【3】I will now present to you the case of a patient I will call Damien，who consulted doctors for over six years for problems that were described as\"hypochondriac\".\n\n【4】**_Damien's problems_**\n\n【5】_Damien read my book When the Body Displaces the Mind 删除10：<u>(Stora， 2007)</u>_ shortly after it was originally published in French and wanted to meet me to assess his situation. He arranged an appointment with me at La Pitie-Salpetriere and I talked to Damien and treated him for over four years in my consulting room.\n\n【6】Damien is a fifty-two-year-old man of average height who works as a business consultant； he seems extremely dynamic. I sense that he has an impressive vital tonus. He has what he calls “psychosomatic\"problems， and this is why he has come to consult me. As with every somatic patient， I begin by addressing all the symptoms from which he is suffering. I insist on hearing his complaint and his account. He begins by telling about some somatic incidents that have invariably resulted in his being hospitalised. At first there were vestibular prob-lems， vertigo and loss of balance， but no neurological problem was detected. He first went into hospital a long time ago and he no longer remembers the date. The second hospitalisation dates from eight years ago， following a relative's death， but he does not explain the family connection to me. I prefer to let him talk without interrupting his speech because it is not possible to move from a factual account of somatic symptoms to a psychic functioning， which would break the thread of his account. I make a quick assessment of the symptoms：symptoms of metabolic problems (considering biological and echo-Doppler carotid tests)， neurological disturbances， and finally gastro-intestinal problems. I prefer to begin by referring Damien to all my colleagues in our hospital's medical departments. It is important to understand the nature of the symptoms and to eliminate or confirm， as necessary， the medical hypotheses one by one.\n\n【7】At the time of writing， I still remember as if it were yesterday that my colleague in the gastroenterology department very quickly called me to tell me his diagnosis： colorectal cancer. This is a patient who con-sulted doctors for over six years and whose somatic illness was stated to be hypochondriac. This is often due to the patient’s attitude mislead-ing the doctor， who very quickly thinks of an \"imaginary psychologi-cal dimension\" without wondering about the symptom itself. Some doctors order tests and when these are negative they feel this confirms their first impression， and pursue no further investigations. In fact， the compartmentalisation of medicine into specialisms is not conducive to a general approach to the patient .\n\n【8】I understand their attitude very well and I know that hypochondria can also reveal a somatic illness or a psychic problem， or both， in the long term. The somatic excitations perceived by the central nervous system cause a signal anxiety that leads the patient to consult a doctor， because he thinks he is suffering from an illness that only a doctor can recognise， which for some patients leads to a major medical nomadism 删除换行 with severe disappointments； the patient is seeking the impossible-he wants to put a name to his problems， to reassure himself.\n\n【9】According to the clinical hypothesis I have developed over many years in the endocrinology department， I ask the patient some questions to find out what has happened in the last seven to ten years， which is the time it takes for a tumour to grow following a trauma or events that are difficult to endure. Of course it is also possible， according to psy-chosomatic hypotheses， to wonder about the probability of a progres-sive disorganisation， an essential depression and/or a psychic fragility following some traumas. These are questions that a psychosomatician always bears in mind when he is with patients suffering from severe illnesses； it is obvious that these different hypotheses are to be chal-lenged or confirmed in the course of the developing psychotherapeutic conversations and complementary medical investigations.\n\n【10】I continue my interview by appealing to his memories of events over the last ten or fifteen years. Damien remembers that， in the past ten years， he has complained about tiredness but not attached any impor-tance to this problem. In the week after our interview， having been informed of the cancer diagnosis， he was at home where he had already slept more than ten hours and when he woke up he went back to sleep for another hour-and-a-half. He wonders with me what such a symp-tom can mean， and I put forward the idea that following the announce-ment of his cancer he had an emotional reaction， causing him to retreat into himself to protect himself from the emotional shock. The tiredness felt over the last few years is probably to be attributed to an excessive consumption of vital energy diverted by the growth of the tumour. It is understandable that the surgeon wants to operate very quickly； shortly after his operation， I visit him in his hospital room to re-establish con-tact and support him in his ordeal. I then meet the surgeon to receive an account of the course of the operation. I think it is important to visit our patients at their bedside so that they know we are not abandoning them， we are at their side to experience their illness， and， above all， that we are there to help them to carry on with their life.\n\n【11】He did not want to inform any family members except for one of his brothers， his brother-in-law， and his wife. He does not want to tell his daughter， because she is looking for work， or his son， because he will soon have to take an exam； he does not want to upset them. He goes back to his metabolic symptoms； he will soon take an echo-Doppler and have some biological tests， then he will go to the neurology department 删除换行 to understand the reason for his vertigo. Damien thus continues the medical visits that I have recommended to him.\n\n【12】The course of a therapy with somatic patients always follows the same sequence： until the psychosomatic unity is repaired， the patient focuses all the sessions on his symptoms and the repair of his body删除17：<u>一</u> _with the doctors' help we must restore the narcissistic completeness of the_ psychosomatic unity. This can take several months or years， and the psy-chosomatician psychotherapist must be patient. Once the repair of the body has been carried out， the therapeutic interviews can be continued in the psychic domain in the place where the regression of the matura-tion process has stopped， at the point of fixation-regression.\n\n【13】In the neurological examination， my colleague agreed with my hypothesis of vertigo caused by a problem in the circulation of blood towards the brain； there is therefore probably a danger of cerebrovascu-lar accidents， which his wife also suspects because she told him about this some time ago. Damien is worried and tells me that since the last session， in which he had tilted his head backwards and sideways to show me that he was no longer suffering from vertigo， there have been some minor vertigo spells. He is afraid that， as usual， he will repress everything and that the anxiety will manifest itself somatically. Dam-ien has some psychoanalytic knowledge and reading that he later uses as a defence system rather than as an aid to understanding his symp-toms. He keeps returning to his fear of vertigo spells that might thwart his new project. His project provides an important elucidation of his symptomatology and his psychosomatic fixations. He wishes， he says， to interest museums and financial sponsors in a plan for some archaeo-logical excavations in sites not currently being mined； this is an exciting project.\n\n【14】I am afraid that the vertigo might manifest itself in the middle of the jungle or the desert； in my opinion he could recruit some colleagues to send in his place and only spend short periods there himself. He has also consulted an ear， nose， and throat specialist who told him that， with a simple manipulation， it would be possible to improve or suppress the vertigo symptoms， caused by otoliths in the inner ear. He is surprised at the anxiety generated by these vertigo spells， whereas he shows great serenity in his struggle against the cancer. The vertigo affects his head and most of his body； he describes himself as someone who tries “to anticipate and control everything.\" He feels that this anxiety is deep and destabilising for his personality. He is afraid that he has lost his 删除换行 capacity to find quick solutions and the spontaneity of his thinking， because he has always planned everything. His plans might take him away from France for several years， and he wonders how he would be able to undertake a therapy， and at what cost for what benefit? He feels that he cannot control all the risks inherent in such a project.\n\n【15】As he mentions risk， I decide to refer to the risk connected with the cancer and to his remission in the coming years； it will be necessary to wait for several years before a remission can be ascertained. As he has a stoma following his operation， he must observe strict conditions of hygiene. What I say， from my concern to protect his health， frustrates him immensely and he promises me that he will see his oncologist to obtain a medical opinion， in addition to his surgeon's opinion. My warn-ing has suddenly encountered the patient's narcissistic defence， as well as the defence of the drive for mastery (Bemiichtigungstrieb)， because he is thwarted in carrying out his plans. Through its omnipotent quality， the narcissism fuels and reinforces the anal drive； in everything he says， Damien manifests a strong striving for mastery and control that presup-poses powerful anal fixations. He talks about his very strict father， who was highly critical， especially towards his wife. He also mentions that， when he was eight years old， his mother threatened to seek a divorce.\n\n【16】In the transference relationship， after my intervention， I assumed the place of the father， to whom he immediately referred since he describes him as a very severe character. I thwarted him with my warnings and he regards me as someone who is preventing him from finishing what he is trying to achieve-just like his father. A severe superego appears here， as well as a fear of emotional abandonment that he experienced as a child.\n\n【17】Damien went to see an oncologist， who completely reassured him about the medical risk of undertaking an extended journey in tropical or desert regions. However， while the doctor did not rule out the possi-bility that psychic difficulties might play a role， he could not explain the importance of the psychic factor in the somatic risk. Damien therefore decided to withdraw from the riskiest parts of his project； namely，long journeys in regions that pose health risks. Damien still speaks in a very detailed and highly structured way， revealing his obsessional character traits.\n\n【18】He addresses what he considers as the major symptom： his anxiety attacks. Ten days after our previous session， he woke up in the mid-dle of the night with stomach ache， diarrhoea， and a full stoma pocket.\n\n【19】He sleeps alone， because his wife has moved to the country for medical reasons； as he says no more about this for the moment， I prefer to keep quiet and wait， because I sense that this is a very delicate problem. The anxiety wells up， accompanied by tetany all along his legs， then it over-whelms him completely. He is overcome by anxiety and he just has time to swallow a Xanax， which calms him down after fifteen minutes. He makes the connection with the two vertigo attacks， when he was also seized by acute anxiety， diarrhoea， and a need to vomit； all these events occurred at night or very early in the morning. It is therefore evident that the psychic apparatus is being overwhelmed by somatic excitations and the unelaborated endogenous excitations， since he does not report any dream that would have allowed the excitations to be either allevi-ated or， in the best case， eliminated-he has somatic manifestations of distress.\n\n【20】We meet again， in the new term in September of the same year， and a new trainee student attends our interviews. I draw her attention， just as I have done gradually above， to Damien's narcissistic strivings and the particular cathexis of the active side of the anal drives； I wonder about his defence against passivity when confronted with an authority by which he feels threatened. The underlying hypothesis suggests a strat-egy of gradually， as soon as it proves possible， exploring the patient’s negative Oedipus complex.\n\n【21】The symptoms continue， and as soon as the quantum of daily exci-tations rises， he experiences vertigo and sometimes has to lie on the floor for more than twenty-four hours at a time； this stops him from thinking.\n\n【22】His recent MRI scan revealed nothing about the vertigo or any neu-rological problems (we can refer here to hypochondriac symptoms)； he adds that he has arranged to see the cardiologist the following week. The psychosomatic psychotherapy continues， but it has not yet brought an end to the anxiety that leads the patient to continue consulting doc-tors. This medical nomadism is fuelled by the rapid displacement of excitations， for no reason； this is a mute， unmentalised worry.\n\n【23】Damien then relates the most recent events in his life. His wife， who has left to take care of her mother， telephones him to complain about the difficulties of taking care of an old person who is in decline； she adds that she cannot possibly arrive late at school (she is a school-teacher in a small class). Damien reassures her， and does not feel too stressed by this call. The next day， his wife calls him again to ask him to come 删除换行 urgently， because she is going back to hospital because of a glaucoma. Damien then seeks every possible solution to avoid having to join her and to be able to attend his work meetings； he asks some neighbours to take care of his wife's mother and his brother-in-law to look after both his mother and his sister. It is not immediately understandable why he does not go to his wife's bedside， given that he realises the gravity of this incident. Why does he keep a distance? What is he protecting himself trom：\n\n【24】He states that， for now， he is managing the situation， and then in the evening things change radically. His twenty-seven-year-old daughter， who is currently sharing his flat while waiting to move somewhere else， comes to join him and they discuss the situation together； he describes her as a strong young woman who， like him， has her feet on the ground. They discuss things together， and during the conversation his daugh-ter’s eyes water a little. He is visibly troubled by the emotion shown by his daughter and does not respond； he continues as if nothing had happened and jokes with her in their usual way. Shortly afterwards， he feels some flashes of heat that force him to go and lie down in order to wipe the sweat from his forehead and have his daughter bring him something to eat； he thought he was having a hypoglycaemia attack.\n\n【25】Damien had been hot； the emotional suppression connected with the lack of empathy for the crisis that his wife was undergoing had found a somatic outlet： his body had experienced the impact of his emotion. However， it cannot be said that Damien is alexithymic； he suppresses his emotions and he closes the door to the emotional manifestations of his unconscious.\n\n【26】His psychiatrist had recently changed his medication， and he is now taking Prozac. I draw his attention to the disinhibiting effect of Prozac， but he does not seem to understand， and he also explains that it is not a problem for him， nor for his wife， as sex is not that important. During the session， on several occasions， he makes some verbal slips and confuses“mother\" and \"wife\". At the end of the session， I draw his attention to the fact that every time a problem arises in his life， he turns to his body to find an answer， whereas perhaps we should understand together the psychic repercussions of these events. He seems almost convinced， but wonders what these repercussions may be； I encourage him to continue our conversations because he trusts me. The voluntary nature of the hospital consultations can have either detrimental or beneficial effects for patients.\n\n【27】_Psychic recovery during psychotherapy_\n\n【28】Following the last session， Damien tells me that he is leaving for the provinces to join his wife. For the first time since our interviews began he talks about his hypertension， and I emphasise that this somatic symptom is accompanied by strong endogenous psychic tensions.\n\n【29】Having returned to Paris， he states very factually， as if a doubt were hovering， that he has chosen his wife， and that despite some ups and down in their relations， he has stayed with her. He does not want to elaborate any further on the state of his marriage； overwhelmed by internal tensions， he turns to another subject.\n\n【30】He prefers to talk about a book that he has recently read； the story brings back some childhood nightmares in which “a beast surprised him and attacked him from behind\"； he sees himself as a child in his bed， placed against one of his bedroom walls. The anxiety reappears in the session and he associates it with his childhood night terrors. In his parents' old house， he slept in a first-floor bedroom with two entrances， one being a door into the main part of the building， and the other a staircase that led down into the common areas， in particular a kitchen and junk room—a place of adventure and games that was frightening after dark. He said he had been scared by the thought that a man might be able to enter the bedroom and kill him. He would then stop breath-ing in order not to be noticed.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

He is complaining of left upper quadrant pain. Onphysical examination he appears restless and agitated， and he is noted to be tachycardic and tachypneic.**  |\n| --- |\n| **What organ is most likely injured in this case?** **The spleen. It is an important organ in immune function and hematopoiesis. The primary function of thespleen is clearance of abnormal RBCs， microorganisms， and particulate matter from the bloodstream.Additionally， it is involved in hematopoiesis (extramedullary hematopoiesis) and synthesis of lgG， properdin，** **and tuftsin.**  |\n\n| Where is the injured organ located? The spleen is located under the rib cage in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen， below the diaphragm.Therefore， during palpation， descent of an enlarged spleen is felt on inspiration.  |\n| --- |\n| Where is the most common site of referred pain in this injury? Left shoulder and trapezius ridge tenderness (C3-C5 dermatomes，same as the roots of the phrenic nerve)may also be present as a result of subdiaphragmatic phrenic nerve irritation. Referred pain is due tosubdiaphragmatic pooling of blood.  |\n| Why is a blunt injury to this organ so concerning? The spleen is a highly vascular organ that filters up to 15% of the total blood volume per minute. Thespleen can hold an average of 40-50 mL of RBCs in reserve and can pool significantly more blood.  |\n| What is the major concern for a patient postsplenectomy?The major concern is sepsis from encapsulated bacterial organisms. Streptococcus pneumoniae， Neisseriameningitidis， and Haemophilus influenzae vaccinations are essential since encapsulated organisms areusually cleared by the spleen. Vaccinations are usually given several weeks before splenectomy， if possible，or 2 weeks after in an emergent case. Antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures and empiric treatmentfor fever are also vital given the immunocompromised state of the asplenic patient.  |\n\n【3】The major concern is sepsis from encapsulated bacterial organisms.
