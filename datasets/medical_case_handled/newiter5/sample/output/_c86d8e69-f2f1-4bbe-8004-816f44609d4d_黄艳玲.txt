A 6‐week‐old infant is admitted to the emergency department (ED) with excessive crying, fatigue and staring episodes.

--------------------------

【4】Infant woke up “screaming” the prior evening and was fussy, crying, grunting, and “staring off into space” prompting ED visit. Caregivers deny fever, emesis and diarrhea. Over the past 2 weeks, the infant has been too tired to finish its feedings, and the infant’s hands and feet have become cool when crying.

【7】On arrival to the ED, the infant is noted to be grunting, and is bradypneic, lethargic and responding to pain by opening eyes only. The infant is mottled and gray with very weak femoral pulses. Her liver is palpable 2 cm below the right costal margin.

【8】Vital signs on arrival are temperature 35°C (95°F), heart rate 150 bpm, blood pressure 35/25 mmHg, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, weight 4.8 kg, and oxygen saturation 100% on room air.

【9】Diagnostic studies and interventions are indicated emergently. This critically ill infant is provided with high‐flow oxygen immediately and a basic metabolic panel, complete blood count, arterial blood gases, and lactate level are obtained when intravenous access is gained. A chest radiograph is also obtained 删除33：<u></u>. The results for basic metabolic panel, complete blood count, and arterial blood gas analysis are shown in Tables 97.1 – 97.3 .

【12】### Based on the data given, what are the differential diagnoses and the most likely diagnosis for this infant?

【13】The differential diagnoses would include cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, structural heart disease, sepsis, inborn error of metabolism, and liver failure. The most likely diagnosis for this infant is cardiomyopathy due to the child’s history, presenting symptoms, and initial imaging.

【21】Cardiomyopathy is defined as an abnormality of the ventricular myocardium that cannot be explained by congenital heart disease or abnormal loading conditions. Presentation can be highly variable, ranging from an incidental finding to cardiogenic shock. Cardiogenic shock is a medical emergency requiring prompt recognition, therapy, and hospitalization. Management of cardiomyopathy with cardiogenic shock involves medical therapies to treat the acutely decompensated heart failure, including potential mechanical support and/or heart transplantation. Subsequent therapy aims to reverse the chronic effects of ventricular remodeling.

【22】There are two main morphologic types of pediatric cardiomyopathy: hypertrophic and dilated. Other less common types include restrictive, non‐compaction, mixed, arrhythmia‐induced, pacemaker induced, and post‐exposure to drugs or toxins, including chemotherapy. Morbidity and mortality are high: only about 20% of children with dilated cardiomyopathy regain normal function within 2 years, and 40% undergo transplantation or die. Infants with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have a 2‐year mortality rate of 30%. Cardiomyopathy may present at any age; in infants, the presentation is often similar to this case. Infants typically compensate for heart failure for some time before their condition requires emergent treatment.

【23】### What additional diagnostic study is needed to confirm your suspected diagnoses?

【24】Cultures and viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were obtained and empiric antibiotics are started. An echocardiogram is necessary based on the history, presentation, and chest radiograph findings. Pediatric cardiology performed a bedside echocardiogram that demonstrated a structurally normal heart with decreased biventricular function, ventricular hypertrophy, and moderate regurgitation across multiple valves. The ejection fraction was assessed to be severely decreased at 14%.

【25】### What is the best way to support cardiac function and increase cardiac output in this infant?

【26】In addition to increasing cardiac output, the immediate stabilization strategy also includes decreasing the workload of the heart. This will include intubation and mechanical ventilation, oxygen, and inotropic support aimed at increasing cardiac output, improving diastolic filling, and decreasing ventricular workload (i.e. afterload reduction). This infant was started on milrinone and epinephrine infusions. Milrinone is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that results in increased inotropy (improved contractility and stroke volume), lusitropy (improved diastolic relaxation and decreased diastolic pressure to allow for improved filling) and vasodilation (afterload reduction). Low‐dose epinephrine is inotropic, as well as a modest vasodilator.

【27】### How would you determine if the therapy was effective?

【28】Frequent invasive and non‐invasive hemodynamic monitoring is indicated. Normalizing heart rate, increased blood pressure and pulse pressure, and improvement in metabolic acidosis would be key markers of efficacy.

【29】### What other therapies would be recommended at this time?

【30】Beta‐blockade (if hemodynamically tolerated) may reduce outflow tract obstruction and allow the heart more time to fill and empty. Diuretics may be used if there is clinical volume overload. If medical therapy is insufficient, mechanical support may be needed. Options could include veno‐arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or a ventricular assist device, which is a pneumatically driven device that can be used in infants (e.g. Berlin heart).

【31】### Which additional diagnostic studies and consults are needed?

【32】A 12‐lead electrocardiogram (EKG) is indicated and multiple abnormalities may be present, including biventricular hypertrophy, arrhythmias, and first‐degree atrioventricular block. Infants with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy should be evaluated for inborn errors of metabolism or the infantile form of Pompe disease. In the case of Pompe disease, the 12‐lead EKG will show very large QRS voltages as well as a very short PR interval. This infant should have a genetics consultation. Additionally, this infant presented with severe liver dysfunction due to acute heart failure and cardiogenic shock; an abdominal ultrasound with Doppler flow would be recommended to ensure there was no thrombus from the low‐flow state resulting in liver dysfunction.
