【15】13.44 A 65-year-old woman who takes a tricyclic antidepressant and metoclo-pramide has serosanguinous discharge from her right nipple. She has no pal-pable breast abnormalities， normal bilateral mammograms， and a right breast ultrasound that does not demonstrate any abnormalities. Her right breast ductogram reveals a cutoff at 3 cm from the nipple. Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient?
A.Observe and instruct her not to manipulate the nipple or breast
增加换行2:B.Change her medications

【16】C. Check her prolactin level

【17】D. Duct excisional biopsy

【19】13.5Which of the following statements is TRUE regarding nipple discharge in women!
A.It is a common presenting symptom for ductal carcinoma of the breast
增加换行2:B.Nipple discharge， breast pain， and breast mass are the three most com-mon complaints related to the breast

【20】C. Dopamine stimulates prolactin and causes nipple discharge

【21】D. Hyperthyroidism causes nipple discharge

【22】E.The concern for breast cancer is raised when the nipple discharge occurs from multiple ducts

【23】13.6 For which of the following patients is a diagnostic duct excision indicated?

【24】A. A 23-year-old woman with right nipple discharge following manipula-tion. She has a family history of breast cancer. Her ultrasound and breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are normal

【25】B.A 48-year-old woman with spontaneous right nipple discharge. Her mammogram and breast ultrasound studies are normal. The right breast ductoscopy revealed no evidence of duct abnormalities

【26】C. A 43-year-old woman with hypothyroidism and nipple discharge with stimulation only. Her serum prolactin level is elevated. Her family history is significant for breast cancer diagnosis in her 52-year-old elder sister

【27】D. A 38-year-old woman with left nipple discharge with normal mammogram and ultrasound demonstrating fibrocystic changes

【28】E.A 33-year-old woman with left nipple bloody discharge with a small filling defect seen on ductography

【29】13.1 C. This is a woman of child-bearing age who presents with some nonspe-cific symptoms including fatigue and apparent physiologic nipple discharge. These symptoms can be consistent with pregnancy； a pregnancy test is indi-cated as the initial evaluation. Other possibilities include hypothyroidism， but that can be evaluated once pregnancy is ruled out.

【30】13.2ID. Papillomatosis is a benign condition associated with papillary prolifera-tion of the ductal epithelium， which can fill up the ducts and cause disten-sion of the ducts. Papillomatosis without atypia is not associated with the increase in cancer risk； however， papillomatosis with atypia carries a 4- to5-fold increase in breast cancer risk. None of the other choices given here are associated with significant increase in breast cancer risks.

【31】13.3E. Prolactin level in the range of 100 ng/mL or greater is abnormally elevated and can be caused by a pituitary adenoma， and this finding should be fol-lowed up by an MRI of the brain. Other findings that are described do not require specific work-ups.

【32】13.4 D.The finding of an abrupt cutoff on ductography in this 65-year-old woman with pathologic nipple discharge needs to be further evaluated by diagnostic duct excision.

【33】13.5B. Nipple discharge， breast pain， and breast mass are the three most com-mon breast-related complaints leading to medical consultations. Nipple dis-charge is an unusual symptom related to breast cancers， and only 5% to 12%of women with nipple discharge are found to have breast cancers.

【34】13.6E. Diagnostic duct excision is indicated for the 33-year-old woman with bloody nipple discharge and a filling defect seen on ductography.

【35】CLINICALPEARLS

【36】The causes of nipple discharge can be grouped as pathologic or physi-ologic. This grouping helps in direct evaluation and treatment. Patients who require surgical evaluation have spontaneous，unilateral， and recur-rent nipple discharges.
Nipple discharge is a disturbing complaint for the patient； notably，only4%to 6% ofthe women with nipple discharge that is not associated with a breast mass have breast cancer. The cancer risk is increased among postmenopausal women， when discharge is associated with abnormal findings on breast imaging， or when a mass is associated with nipple discharge.
 The most common cause ofunilateral serosanguineous nipple discharge in the absence ofa breast mass is an intraductal papilloma.
Pathologic nipple discharge evaluation needs to include evaluation to rule out breast cancers.
 Antihypertensive medications， phenothiazines， antidepressants， and antipsychotic medications can all cause nipple discharges. (Medications that block the secretion ofdopamine can cause galactorrhea.)王磊
