【47】AIPMNBPancreatic pseudocyst

【48】C. Mucinous cystic neoplasm

【49】D. Serous cystic neoplasm

【50】E. Pancreatic duplication

【51】ANSWERS

【52】33.1 C. Adenocarcinoma of pancreatic ductal origin is the most common of the peri-ampullary cancers. Cholangiocarcinomas arising from the distal com-mon bile duct is the second most common， and adenocarcinoma of the Ampulla of Vater is the third most common. Duodenal carcinoma is the least common peri-ampullary cancer.

【53】33.2 A. Roughly two-thirds of pancreatic adenocarcinomas are located in the head or uncinate process of the pancreas； 15% are located in the body； 10% are located in the pancreatic tail， and the remaining lesions are diffuse in location. Pancreatic cancers located in the head and unicinate process are the most likely to be curable because of earlier symptom onset.

【54】33.3E. For this patient with obstructive jaundice and severe itching secondary to widely metastatic pancreatic cancer originating from the pancreatic head， endoscopic stent placement can help relieve his jaundice and improve his quality of life. With metastatic disease， there is no indication for surgical resection.

【55】33.4A. This patient has obstructive jaundice and a localized mass of unknown nature in the head of the pancreas and is a candidate for pancreaticoduo-denectomy. The procedure can be both diagnostic and therapeutic for this gentleman providing that he is healthy enough to withstand the surgical pro-cedure. The patient with Childs Class C cirrhosis is a poor surgical candi-date for this operation. Treatment of an isolated duodenal adenoma is local resection. Treatment of a large symptomatic pseudocyst in the head of the pancreas is internal drainage.

【56】33.5A. The majority of patients with pancreatic cancers present with unresect-able disease either because of local advancement or the presence of distant metastases. The prognosis of patients with distant metastasis is extremely poor； therefore， there is no indication to perform liver resections for patients with metastases to the liver. Obstructive jaundice is associated with eleva-tions in total bilirubin with predominant elevations in direct bilirubin values.

【57】33.6 B. Greater than 50% of patients with pancreatic cancers present with locally advanced disease or distant metastases. Complete resections of pancreatic cancers are associated with approximately 15%5-year survival.

【58】33.7B. Whipple procedures with complete resections (R0) can provide patients with the opportunity for cure； however， it is only associated with 10% to 15%5-year survival. The postoperative mortality associated with Whipple resec-tions has improved significantly over the past 20 years owing to improve-ments in operative and supportive care； however， the long-term survival has not change dramatically.

【59】33.8B. Thirty to fifty percent of main-duct IPMNs harbor adenocarcinomas； therefore， pancreatic resection is indicated with this diagnosis. The goal of surgical resection for IPMN is to prevent cancer occurrence. On the other hand， IPMNs arising from minor ducts have a low probability of becoming malignant and do not require surgical removal.

【60】33.9ID. A cystic mass in a patient without a prior history of pancreatitis and with fluid analysis revealing low amylase， low CEA， negative mucin stain，and scant cells most likely represents a serous cystic neoplasm. This is a benign finding with low malignant potential.

【61】CLINICALPEARLS

【62】删除38：<u>)</u>The classic presentation of malignant extrahepatic biliary obstruction is painless jaundice and a palpable nontender gallbladder.The majority of patients with pancreatic cancers have locally-advanced diseases or metastases at the time ofdiagnosis.

【63】In general， pancreaticoduodenectomy should be reserved for patients with resectable malignancies near the Ampulla of Vater. 》 Patients with pancreatic cancers directly invading the superior mesen-teric artery are not considered candidates for surg ical resection because of poor disease prognosis even after resection. High amylase values， low CEA， and negative mucin stain during fluid analysis ofa cystic pancreatic lesion rules out malignancy or lesions with 删除换行1 malignant transformation potentials.
 Endoscopic ultrasound is the most reliable diagnostic modality to evalu-ate the relationship between a pancreatic adenocarcinoma in the head or uncinate process and the superior mesenteric vessels.黄艳玲
