【0】Case 10
A 21-year-old nulliparous woman complains of lower abdominal“heaviness.”She takes an oral contraceptive and is in a monogamous relationship. On examination， she has a normal-sized， nontender uterus， and a 9-cm right adnexal mass is palpated. Her pregnancy test is negative. On sonography， the mass appears cystic and solid.

【1】What is the most likely diagnosis?

【2】What are some of the histologic findings expected in this mass?

【3】ANSWERS TO CASE 10： OVARIAN TERATOMA

【4】Summary： A 21-year-old nulliparous woman has a 9-cm right adnexal mass that on sonography appears cystic and solid.

【5】Most likely diagnosis： Benign cystic teratoma of the ovary

【6】Expected histologic findings in this mass： Any tissue may be found， but the most common are sebum， skin， hair， teeth， thyroid， and neurologic tissues

【7】CLINICAL CORRELATION

【8】This young woman has an ovarian mass that on ultrasound has cystic and solid components， a classic presentation of a benign cystic teratoma (dermoid cyst) of the ovary. Although benign cystic teratomas are often asymptomatic，larger dermoids (as in this case) can present with pelvic pain， pressure， fullness， or dyspareunia. The patient's pregnancy test was reported as negative； however， in rare cases， degenerating ectopic pregnancies can be missed with urine human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) assays because of the low sensitivity of urine pregnancy tests in the presence of very low (<25 mIU/mL) serum hCG levels. The fact that the patient is engaged in a monogamous relationship should decrease the risks of her contracting gonorrhea or Chlamydia， hence decreasing the possibility of pelvic inflammatory disease and tuboovarian abscess (TOA). The patient also gives a history of oral contraceptive (OC)use， which also serves to decrease the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease and/or TOA. Oral contraceptives also greatly decrease the likelihood of the mass being a physiologic ovarian mass (follicular cyst， hemorrhagic corpus luteum cyst， etc.). The ultrasound shows a complex (both cystic and solid) ovarian mass， which also is not consistent with an abscess or a physiologic ovarian or paraovarian cyst.

【9】Although some disagreement exists over the timing and indications for sur-gery in complex masses under 6 cm or simple cysts of any size， a 9-cm com-plex ovarian mass almost always needs to be explored surgically. This is due primarily to the small but not insignificant risk of malignancy. Upon confir-mation of benign intraoperative findings， efforts should be directed at sal-vaging all normal tissue from the affected ovary and removing only that tissue which has undergone neoplastic degeneration.

【11】Objectives

【12】Describe the classifications of ovarian neoplasms.

【13】Describe the serum marker used to evaluate ovarian neoplasms.

【14】Describe the differential for a pelvic mass.

【15】Definitions

【16】Tuboovarian abscess： An abscess formed within the adnexal space con-sisting of ovary， fallopian tube， and matted bowel caused by untreated or inadequately treated pelvic inflammatory disease.

【17】Endometrioma： A large (6- to 8-cm) loculated collection of endometrial tissue that can develop in the pelvis in females with endometriosis. As this tissue degenerates， it turns brownish in color and is known as a“chocolate cyst.”

【18】Struma ovarii： A benign teratoma in which functional thyroid tissue is the predominant histologic finding. Approximately 2 to 3 percent of ter-atomas are classified as struma ovarii. Thyrotoxicosis is clinically appar-ent in 5 percent of these cases.

【19】Ovarian torsion： A condition in which the ovary twists on its attachment to the infundibulopelvic ligament， thus interrupting ovarian blood sup-ply. This usually is seen in conjunction with pathologic enlargement of the ovary and can be dynamic (intermittent) in nature or complete； the latter results in infarction and necrosis of the affected ovary.

【20】DISCUSSION

【21】Although they may present in any decade of life， benign cystic teratomas are the most common ovarian neoplasm found in females under age 35 (excluding physiologic follicular and corpus luteum cysts) and are also the most common ovarian neoplasm found in pregnancy. Approximately 10 to 15 percent of all cases involve both ovaries. Table 10-1 lists the differential diagnoses of a pelvic mass， and Table 10-2 lists the categories of ovarian neoplasms.

【22】Benign cystic teratomas arise from a single germ cell in the ovary and have a normal female karyotype (46，XX). Because of the pluripotent nature of germ cells， teratomas can differentiate into tissues derived from all three embry-ologic cell lines (endoderm， ectoderm， and mesoderm). Thus， a “mature”ter-atoma often contains skin， fat， sebaceous glands， sweat glands， hair， smooth and striated muscle， cartilage， bone， teeth， neural tissue， and gas-trointestinal tissue 删除33：<u></u>. Functional thyroid tissue is found in approximately 12 percent of benign cystic teratomas， and rarely this tissue will proliferate into the predominant cellular element in the teratoma. This unique teratoma hence is referred to as struma ovarii and will secrete enough functional thyroid hormone to cause acute thyrotoxicosis in approximately 5 percent of cases.

【23】Benign cystic teratomas are usually asymptomatic and are found most com-monly during routine gynecologic screening or incidentally during unassoci-ated surgical or radiographic procedures. Larger teratomas give rise to acute adnexal torsion in approximately 11 percent of cases. The increased risk of torsion with teratomas compared with other causes of ovarian enlargement is thought to be due to fat content， allowing the teratoma to “float” in the

【26】abdominal cavity instead of lodging against other structures. Other significant complications include secondary infection and acute hemorrhage with the potential for septic and/or hypovolemic shock. Rupture or perforation is seen in less than 5 percent of cases and occurs more frequently in association with pregnancy. When acute rupture occurs， spillage of the contents of the teratoma into the abdominal cavity often precipitates a surgical emergency， whereas more chronic leakage of contents can produce a severe chemical peritonitis that also requires surgical intervention. Malignant degeneration occurs in less than 2 percent of all recognized teratomas.

【27】Other germ cell tumors include dysgerminomas， endodermal sinus tumors， and choriocarcinomas. These neoplasms usually occur in females under age30 years. Dysgerminomas are rapidly growing and very radiosensitive and chemosensitive. Endodermal sinus tumors often secrete a-fetoprotein， whereas choriocarcinomas secrete human chorionic gonadotropin.

【30】Epithelial tumors of the ovary most commonly affect females over age30 years， particularly postmenopausal women. Malignant serous cystadeno-carcinomas are the most common， usually presenting with ascites. Treatment includes surgical excision followed by combination chemotherapy. Mucinous tumors may become very large， sometimes exceeding 30 lb in weight； their rupture can lead to chronic bouts of bowel obstruction (pseudomyxoma peritonei).

【31】Stromal tumors of the ovary are often functional， secreting estrogen(granulosa-theca cell tumors) or androgens (Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors). These neoplasms can present as precocious puberty， postmenopausal bleeding， or hirsutism. They are usually solid tumors that are slow growing and rarely metastasize early. Surgery is the best treatment for these tumors.
