【4】### 9.1.5 Discussion

【5】She had met all KD criteria at both first and second time when presented at hospitals 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 1 \]</u>. Differential diagnosis of sepsis and viral conjunctivitis should be considered.

【6】### 9.1.6 Case Special Clinical Features

【7】1.  1.
    This girl was taken to hospital at first illness, on Day 2–3 she developed rashes all over body and cervical lymphadenectasis, and investigation revealed WBC and CRP increased significantly. A resident on duty considered she had KD and requested tests on the NT pro-BNP and ESR. But she was in PICU, where residents shift frequently and are very busy in PICU of China. The next resident on duty neglected the note and missed her red conjunctiva, and transferred the patient to respiratory ward as severe pneumonia patient. If he reviewed her chest CT scan results with care, he would have found her pneumonia was not so severe, but her ALT was up to 437 U/L and she had hands/feet edema (on Day 5 of illness her albumen was normal). Thanks to the resident of respiratory ward who found her symptoms met criteria of KD and requested consultation with. Luckily she was treated on time.
2.  2.
    Aspirin has been the first choice to treat KD. This girl developed rashes after taking aspirin when she had recurrent KD. Considering she had taken aspirin before and did not have itch, we continued to give her aspirin and monitored the dynamic changes in rashes at the same time. Eventually, rashes regressed. We concluded that she was not allergic to aspirin 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 2 \]</u>.
3.  3.
    It has been reported that about 1–2% KD patients will have recurrent KD within 2 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 1 \]</u>. During the treatment for her first KD, aspirin was stopped earlier, and there was no record showing when she stopped taking aspirin during recurrent KD. Coronary dilation was not found until on Day11 of recurred KD.
4.  4.
    KD vasculitis can present all over the body, which can cause inflammation in intestinal arteries, leading to edema in intestinal wall. As a result of this edema, indigitation is developed and will need warm saline clysis to be relieved (case 25). However, if it is not identified on time, the complication can lead to intestinal obstruction, and then the necrosis segment need to be surgically removed. This girl had incomplete indigitation, and the inflammation regressed after IVIG and oral aspirin treatment, and then edema in intestine settled subsequently.
5.  5.
    The most common complication in KD is digestive system symptoms. When this patient had recurrence of KD, she had black stool and dark brown urine. Investigation revealed higher T Bil and major in D Bil, positive urobilirubin, which supported she had cholestatic hepatitis (case 17).
6.  6.
    In KD, inflammatory mediators may cause necrosis of adrenal medulla 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 3 \]</u>. It is not clear how calcification is developed in acute stage and there is no literature reporting this. The calcification was found by chance in chest CT performed in her first KD diagnosis. It was regressed two years later when she had recurrent KD. The mechanism is not clear and further researches need to be done.
