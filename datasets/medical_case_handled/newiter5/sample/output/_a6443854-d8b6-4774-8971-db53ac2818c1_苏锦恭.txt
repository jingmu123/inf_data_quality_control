【0】CASE 77: MULTIPLE HYPERKERATOTIC PAPULES AND NODULES

【1】ON THE FINGERS

【2】History

【3】A 51-year-old patient under the care of the haematologists is referred to the dermatology clinic with a 6-year history of multiple papules and nodules on her fingers. The  删除换行1 lesions have slowly been increasing in size and number over the last two years and are  删除换行1 mainly asymptomatic. The lesions were treated with liquid nitrogen by her GP but they  删除换行1 were unresponsive. She had been diagnosed two years previously with stage B chronic  删除换行1 lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). She has received several courses of chlorambucil, fludarabine and cyclophosphamide to which she partially responded and is being considered for  删除换行1 alemtuzumab (Campath – antiCD52) biological therapy in the future.
Examination

【4】She has multiple hyperkeratotic flesh-coloured papules and nodules, mainly over the  删除换行1 dorsi of her fingers and hands 删除33：<u></u> The lesions are warty in nature and firm on  删除换行1 palpation. The surrounding skin is normal.

【5】At the time of review in the dermatology clinic, blood counts were normal.

【8】Questions

【9】• Why does she have multiple lesions on  删除换行1 her hands?

【10】• What treatment options are possible  删除换行1 for her skin lesions?
ANSWER 77

【11】This woman has been suffering from multiple viral warts on her hands for many years.
The warts result from an infection with human papilloma virus (HPV) in the cutaneous keratinocytes. HPV is specific to humans and is passed by direct skin contact and  删除换行1 through fomites. HPV infects the basal keratinocytes; when these infected cells leave  删除换行1 the basal layer they become highly differentiated, triggering viral genome replication.
Consequently, when the keratinocytes reach the epithelial surface, viral particles are  删除换行1 released with the sloughed-off cells into the environment where they can survive for  删除换行1 many months.
HPV infections are common in the general population but are more frequently found  删除换行1 in patients who are immunosuppressed, when warts are often multiple. CLL causes  删除换行1 down-regulation of immune surveillance and an increased susceptibility to all manner  删除换行1 of infections. In addition, chemotherapy depletes patients’ white cell populations rendering them more vulnerable to infections. These patients are unable to clear the HPV and  删除换行1 subsequently develop multiple recalcitrant warts.
Although cutaneous warts are not harmful in themselves they can cause a considerable  删除换行1 amount of distress to patients both psychologically and socially. Patients frequently feel  删除换行1 embarrassed by their warts and can often feel stigmatized by others.
Most treatments for HPV are locally destructive (cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen, salicylic acid, electrodessication, CO2 laser) and then the host’s immune cells ‘mop-up’ the  删除换行1 residual virus released; however, when the host’s immune system is suboptimal, locally  删除换行1 destructive treatments are frequently ineffective.
Although not licensed to treat cutaneous warts, treatment options include immunotherapy with imiquimod 5% cream (daily with Elastoplast occlusion) or diphencyprone (DPC) 删除换行1 fortnightly. DPC is a highly sensitizing chemical – patients are rendered allergic to it by  删除换行1 painting a small amount on their forearm skin, then increasing percentages are applied  删除换行1 directly to the warts to recruit immune cells into the local tissue. Cure rates of 60 per cent  删除换行1 are reported in immunosuppressed patients after 6 months of treatment. This patient was  删除换行1 treated with DPC immunotherapy to good effect. Topical bleomycin has also been used  删除换行1 with some success to treat recalcitrant warts in this group of patients.

【12】 KEY POINTS

【13】• If a patient presents with multiple HPV warts, then consider immune deficiency.

【14】• Warts will eventually resolve spontaneously in the majority of patients.
• Management of warts includes local destructive modalities and immunotherapy to the skin.苏锦恭
