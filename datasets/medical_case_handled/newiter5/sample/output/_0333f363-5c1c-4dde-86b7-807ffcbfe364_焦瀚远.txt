【0】CASE 39: A STIFF GREAT TOE

【1】History

【2】A 45-year-old woman has been experiencing a painful right great toe for 4 years. There is  删除换行1 no recall of trauma or infection, or history of gout in the great toe, but it is swollen and  删除换行1 stiff. The pain is localized to the first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint, and is aggravated  删除换行1 by activity. The woman is otherwise medically fit and well.

【3】Examination
The first MTP joint shows no signs of erythema. There is a firm dorsal swelling over the  删除换行5 MTP joint that is tender to palpation. There is no active or passive dorsiflexion in the  删除换行1 first MTP joint. There are no signs of neurovascular deficit. Radiographs of the affected  删除换行1 toe are shown in Figs 39.1 and 39.2.

【9】ANSWER 39

【10】The diagnosis is hallux rigidus because of the stiffness and presence of dorsal osteophytes  删除换行1 seen on the radiographs. This condition encompasses mild to severe degenerative arthritis  删除换行1 of the first MTP joint of the foot. The patient complains of pain from impingement of the  删除换行1 dorsal osteophytes, especially during walking on rough ground and slopes. The patient  删除换行1 may also complain of diffuse, lateral forefoot pain resulting from increased weightbearing on the lateral foot to offload the hallux. Dorsiflexion is restricted, but the foot  删除换行1 may demonstrate compensatory hyperextension of the interphalangeal joint.

【11】Hallux rigidus is the second most common condition affecting the great toe, the first  删除换行1 being hallux valgus. The condition is more common in females than males. This condition is seen in two distinct populations: those who present in adolescence and those who  删除换行1 present in adulthood. In the adolescent type, localized chondral lesions in the articular  删除换行1 surface of the metatarsal head are present. In the adult type, there is more generalized  删除换行1 arthritis.

【12】Radiological features include squaring off of the first MTP joint and loss of joint space,  删除换行1 osteophytes as seen in the radiographs, cyst formation and sclerosis. The articular degenerative changes are associated with dehydration of the cartilage, which in turn is more  删除换行1 susceptible to injury resulting from shear and compressive forces. The subchondral bone  删除换行1 shares these stresses, which subsequently lead to increased subchondral bone density, formation of periarticular osteophytes and, in severe cases, cystic changes. The osteophytes  删除换行1 limit first MTP joint motion. In severe cases, the articular cartilage is completely denuded.
Initially the management is conservative. Medication options include analgesic and  删除换行1 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Mechanical methods limiting the first  删除换行5 MTP joint motion are helpful. The use of in-shoe orthotics with medial stiffness, stiffsoled shoes with a rocker bottom, shoes with a wide toe box, low-heeled shoes, and  删除换行1 shoe modifications, such as a steel shank placed along the entire medial side, may be  删除换行1 beneficial. Activity modifications include avoiding extremes of dorsiflexion of the great  删除换行1 toe, such as those caused by kneeling or squatting with the toes in an extended position.
Manipulation combined with steroid injection into the joint can be useful in the early  删除换行1 stages of the disease.

【13】Conservative management can often be used to successfully treat patients with varying  删除换行1 degrees of severity of hallux rigidus. However, in refractory cases the choice of operation depends on the degree of involvement, limitations of the range of movement, and  删除换行1 the person’s activity level. Surgical options comprising joint-sparing procedures that  删除换行1 remove the dorsal osteophyte (chielectomy) are indicated in early disease. Other surgical  删除换行1 procedures are bone-cutting (proximal phalanx and/or metatarsal osteotomy) and joint  删除换行1 replacement, which can improve joint movement and relieve pain but is not without  删除换行1 complications. Joint fusion (arthrodesis), particularly in advanced cases, provides reliable  删除换行1 results in individuals involved in strenuous activities.

【14】KEY POINTS

【15】• Hallux rigidus is associated with mild to severe degenerative arthritis of the first MTP 

【16】joint of the foot.

【17】• Pain comes from impingement of the dorsal osteophytes.

【18】• Hallux rigidus may present in adolescence or in adulthood.删除个例：<u>Orthopaedics</u>焦瀚远
