【0】CASE 34

【1】A33-year-old woman presents with a complaint ofheadaches. She has had head-aches since she was a teenager， but they have become more debilitating recently The episodes occur once or twice each month and last for up to 2 days. The pain begins in the right temple or at the back ofthe right eye and spreads to the entire scalp over a few hours. She describes the pain as a sharp， throbbing sensation that gradually worsens and is associated with severe nausea. Several factors aggravate the pain， including loud noises and movement. She has taken several over-the-counter medications for the pain， but the only thing that works is going to sleep in a quiet， darkened room. A thorough history reveals that her mother suffers from migraine headaches. Her vital signs， general physical examination， and a thor-ough neurologic examination are all within normal limits.

【2】What is the most likely diagnosis?

【3】What imaging study is most appropriate at this time?

【4】What are the most appropriate therapeutic options?

【5】 34：Summary： A 33-year-old woman presents with headaches that are throbbing and over her right eye. Her headaches have occurred since she was a teenager and have progressively worsened. She has not found relief from over-the-counter preparations.1\. Know the differential diagnosis of chronic headache.

【6】2\. Learn the “red flag”'symptoms and signs that should prompt rapid， specific diagnostic and treatment interventions.

【7】3\. Know how to manage common headache syndromes.The patient described in the case has symptoms that are very characteristic of classic migraines without aura. Her headaches are unilateral， throbbing in nature， and have been progressively worsening. Migraine headaches are the most common headaches of vascular origin and the second most common cause of headaches overall. Migraines are a member of a group of primary headache syndromes dif-ferentiated by their associated features. Migraines typically cause recurrent epi-sodes of headache， nausea， and vomiting. They can also be associated with other neurologic symptoms such as photophobia， light-headedness，paresthesias， vertigo， and visual disturbances. In the patient described in this case， the history and lack of physical findings can reasonably lead to the diagnosis of migraine headaches without aura (“common migraine")， the most frequently occurring form. Other classifications of migraines include migraine with aura (“classic migraine")， oph-thalmoplegic migraine， retinal migraine， and childhood periodic syndromes that may be precursors to or associated with migraines. During the evaluation of this patient， the focus should be on determining the etiology of the headache， assessing for any red flags  that may indicate worse pathologic causes， identify-ing triggers， and therapy for the condition.

【8】According to the International Headache Society， symptoms diagnostic of migraine headache  include moderate to severe headache with a pulsating quality； unilateral location； nausea and/or vomiting； photophobia；

phonophobia； worsening with activity； multiple attacks lasting for 4 hours to3 days； and absence of history or physical examination findings that would make it likely that the headache is the result of another cause. Common triggers of migraine headaches include menses， fatigue， hunger， and stress.

删除21：<u>Adapted from the International Headache Society Classif cation 删除10：<u>(Headache Classif cation Committee of the International Headache Society，2004)</u>.CLUSTER HEADACHE： Unilateral headaches that may have a high male pre-dominance， can be located in the orbital， supraorbital， or temporal region. It is gen-erally described as a deep， excruciating pain lasting from 15 minutes to 3 hours. These headaches are usually episodic； however， a small subset may have chronic headaches.</u>
CHRONIC DAILYHEADACHE： Experiencing headache on 15 days or more per month. Chronic daily headache (CDH) is not a single entity； it can encompass a number of headache syndromes， including chronic tension headaches， migraines， infection， inflammation，trauma， and medication overuse.Status： A severe headache that has lasted more than 72 hours.A patient with symptoms and signs consistent with migraine and who does not have any “red flag”findings 删除25：<u></u> does not require any further testing prior to instituting treatment. Neuroimaging should be performed if there is an unexplained neurologic abnormality on examination or if the headache syndrome is not typical of either migraines or some other primary headache disorder. The presence of rapidly increasing headache frequency or a history of either lack of coor-dination， focal neurologic symptom， or headache awakening the patient from sleep raises the likelihood of finding an abnormality on an imaging test. Magnetic reso-nance imaging (MRI) may be more sensitive than computed tomography (CT) scanning for the identification of abnormalities， but it may not be more sensitive at identifying significant abnormalities. CT scanning would be initial imaging for“thunderclap"headaches where intracranial bleeds are considered. Other testing(eg， blood tests， electroencephalogram \[EEG\]) should only be performed for diag-nostic purposes ifthere is a suspicion based on the history or physical examination.The goal of therapy in migraine prophylaxis is a reduction in the severity and frequency of headache by 50% or more. Options for pharmacologic treatment and prophylaxis of migraines are listed in Tables 34-3 and 34-4， respectively.Tension headache is the most prevalent form of primary headache disorder， typically presenting with pericranial muscle tenderness and a description of a bilateral band-like distribution of the pain. Headaches can last from 30 minutes to 7 days and there is no aggravation by walking stairs or similar routine physi-cal activity. There is no associated nausea or vomiting. Both photophobia and phonophobia are absent， or one， but not the other， is present. They can be either episodic (<180 d/y) or chronic (>180 d/y).

Initial medical therapy of episodic tension-type headache includes aspirin， acet-aminophen， and NSAIDs. Combination analgesics containing caffeine are second-line options. Measures to minimize risk of medication-overuse headaches include limiting use of drugs to treat acute headache to 2 to 3 d/wk， avoiding opioids and sedative hypnotics， and monitoring medication intake
