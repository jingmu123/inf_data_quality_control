【0】### Treatment Planning

【1】This section provides a sample of ways that therapists teach clients about the concepts of faulty cognitive maps and maladaptive schemas; help them evaluate beliefs by examining empirical evidence, effect on mood, degree of rationality, or impact on achieving goals; and promote positive cognitive change.

【2】#### Explanations and Teaching

【3】A commonly used method provides an ABC model for teaching clients the role of cognitions in determining their emotional reactions. The therapist begins by explaining that we usually operate on the assumption that events or people make us feel a certain way: “I got depressed because he didn’t call.” “She makes me mad when she asks where I’m going.” “He told me I had to work on the weekend, so I snapped.” This cause-effect assumption can be drawn with the letters A and C:

【4】Then the therapist can explain why this is not so: The same event can cause different feelings. There is something that intervenes between A and C, and that is what you think (B):

【5】Once this ABC model is understood, clients become collaborators in searching for the thoughts that cause their feelings. They learn that (a) it is their own thinking that is creating pain and frustration, and (b) they have control over their thinking and therefore can choose to think differently.

【6】#### Therapeutic Conversations

【7】Cognitive maps will be changed in the course of any type of therapeutic conversation. Sometimes the conversation is a philosophical discussion of the client’s view of the world and an evaluation of its tenets in terms of truth, morality, expediency, and other values. Narrative therapists encourage clients to tell stories about their lives and use techniques such as externalizing or reauthoring conversations to encourage the client to create an alternative view.

【8】An example of three different reactions to the same event will illustrate the power of thinking. For instance, here is how three people reacted to a rejection letter from a graduate school:

【9】1.  Person 1 became severely depressed; she interpreted the letter as catastrophic proof of her worthlessness. She decided she was not smart enough for graduate school and found a job that she never liked.
2.  Person 2 felt relief and elation; the rejection letter meant that he was free to pursue what he loves instead of pleasing his parents. He enrolled in art school.
3.  Person 3 became more motivated and determined; she interpreted the rejection as an unfortunate but impersonal event and understood it as a reasonable outcome, given the high number of applicants for few positions. She decided to improve her GRE scores and apply again, this time to more schools.

【10】Therapists can tell stories of their own lives and struggles, talking about their own schemas and how they were changed through experiences and choices. After listening to the client’s stories, the therapist can offer a hunch about a possible schema: You seem to have the expectation that this problem can be solved without your having to expend any effort. The wording and tone of voice show that the therapist is tentative, awaiting the client’s agreement or disagreement. Therapists need to be sensitive to the client’s feelings and careful not to shame clients by implying that they were stupid to have such faulty beliefs. By connecting schemas to prior life experiences, you can help people understand that their schemas make sense, they just have to be updated.

【11】#### Persuasion and Direct Influence

【12】Therapists also teach clients about the cognitive concept of “rights” and about how beliefs about the rights of the self and others contribute to either unassertiveness or aggressiveness instead of an appropriate level of assertiveness. Lange and Jakubowski 通用删除7(英):<u>(1978)</u> illustrate how socialization messages that are more commonly given to girls than boys can limit their sense of personal rights:

【13】   I have no right to place my needs above those of other people.
   I have no right to do anything that would imply that I am better than other people.
   I have no right to feel angry or to express my anger.
   I have no right to make requests of other people.
   I have no right to do anything that might hurt someone else’s feelings.

【14】Here are some examples of rights that empower people to speak up and express their thoughts and feelings, ask for what they want, and say no to what they do not want:

【15】   I have the right to assert my needs because they are as important as those of other people.
   I have a right to show my abilities, enjoy my accomplishments, and take pride in myself.
   I have a right to my angry feelings, and I have a right to express them appropriately at the time they occur so they won’t build up and explode.
   If my rights are violated, I have the right to make demands for change.
   I have the right to express my thoughts and feelings, even if occasionally someone’s feelings get hurt, as long as I am not deliberately trying to inflict hurt.

【16】#### Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy

【17】Training in CBT will give tools for working with faulty cognitive maps and will build competence in cognitive formulations. The approach of CBT is to use an agenda, a didactic approach, and structured activities. However, an exclusive reliance on CBT will limit your treatment options. Reinecke and Freeman 通用删除7(英):<u>(2003)</u> make the point that:

【18】Any intervention or technique that alters a patient’s perceptions or beliefs might be viewed as cognitive. The number of techniques that are potentially available is virtually infinite. The effective cognitive therapist is able to provide patients with experiences in a creative, flexible manner that will refute their maladaptive beliefs. 

【19】#### Create a Collaborative Relationship

【20】In Aaron Beck’s language, you are engaging in “collaborative empiricism,” teaching the client to function as a “personal scientist” by testing beliefs against empirical reality. Instead of taking the attitude that you have to change the client, assume that an adult of normal intelligence will want to make changes when he discovers that his own patterns of thinking are creating and maintaining problems.

【21】#### Downward Arrow Technique

【22】By repeating the same questions (And that means? And then? And next?), a series of responses leads the client from the original thought to deeper schemas and core beliefs. By drawing a downward arrow on paper as you write each successive response, you are showing that the movement is toward a deeper, fundamental level. For example, when the client identifies a negative thought that leads to anxiety about performance, good questions to ask are If that thought were true, why would it be upsetting ? Or What would that mean to you ? A client will move from I might make a mistake to My colleagues will think I’m stupid to They will know that I don’t deserve this job to That would mean I’m worthless.

【23】When the questions do not produce a “deeper” response, then the core belief has been identified and the therapist can move on to challenging that belief. Once this technique has been demonstrated in a session with the therapist, the client is able to use it as a homework assignment.

【24】#### Cost-Benefit Analysis

【25】Instead of addressing whether a core belief is rational or true, the cost-benefit analysis engages the client in an examination of whether it is useful to continue to maintain that belief. The belief is written down, and then under it are drawn two columns, one for advantages or reasons for maintaining and the other for disadvantages or reasons for changing. Then, when the two lists are finished, the client divides 100 points between the two columns to indicate the relative weight given to each argument.

【26】Clum 通用删除7(英):<u>(1990)</u> provides an example of the downward arrow technique with a person who has a fear of driving on the interstate highway.

【27】#### Identifying the Underlying Belief

【28】1.  Therapist: What will happen?
2.  Client: I will have a panic attack.
3.  Therapist: What will happen next?
4.  Client: I will have to pull off the road.
5.  Therapist: And next?
6.  Client: I will be there forever.

【29】#### Challenging the Belief

【30】1.  Therapist: How likely is it that you will be there forever?
2.  Client: Of course I wouldn’t be there forever. Either my panic attack would subside and I’d drive off, or someone would come to help me. Panic attacks always end, so I’ll be able to drive away. And the police always stop to help cars stopped alongside the road.

【31】Burns 通用删除7(英):<u>(2005)</u> provided an example of a cost-benefit analysis for the belief “I need everyone’s approval to be worthwhile.”

【32】#### Advantages

【33】I’ll work hard to get people to approve of me; I’ll respect other people and pay careful attention to what they say and how they feel; I’ll sell lots of life insurance and make lots of money; I’ll be a people person and have lots and lots of friends. I’ll feel great when people do approve of me.

【34】#### Disadvantages

【35】Other people will control my self-esteem; I’ll get upset when people criticize me; I may try too hard and turn people off; I may not know what I believe in or stand for; my emotions will go up and down like a roller coaster depending on whether people like me.

【36】In the example, the client gave 30 points to the advantages and 70 to the disadvantages.

【37】#### Focus on Changing Behaviors

【38】Behavior change can precede schema change. To change poor self-esteem, the person needs data that he or she is behaving in a way worthy of esteem; people create self-efficacy beliefs by experiencing mastery at challenging tasks. The Skill Deficits (BL3) hypothesis can be integrated: As people become more competent and effective, they will develop positive beliefs about themselves, as well as achieve positive appraisals from others, which also contribute to confidence and optimism.

【39】If the cognitive map creates fear by labeling many situations as “threatening and dangerous,” it can be beneficial to help the person engage in risky behaviors, doing what is difficult, in spite of fear. Then when the client masters those situations, the cognitive map will change and the situations will no longer be labeled dangerous. For instance, Albert Ellis gave this assignment to a client who had catastrophic beliefs about the consequences of appearing silly in public: Take the New York subway and as you approach each station, shout out the name of the stop.苏锦恭
