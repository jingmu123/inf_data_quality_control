【0】CASE 60: MUSCLE PAIN

【1】History

【2】The general practitioner is visited by his patient, a 65-year-old woman, who had been diagnosed as having adhesive capsulitis of the right shoulder some months previously 删除25：<u></u>. The GP had referred her for physiotherapy to stretch the muscles and restore function  删除换行1 and mobility, and she had taken simple paracetamol for pain relief. This had helped and the  删除换行1 pain was less troublesome and the range of movements had increased, although the patient  删除换行1 was aware that it could take some time for her to recover substantially. Also of importance  删除换行1 was that she had received some bereavement counselling from Cruse Bereavement Care and  删除换行1 she had found this very helpful 删除25：<u></u>. She has been visiting the GP regularly and feeling much more hopeful about things. She was even managing to get out and about more; she  删除换行1 has been food shopping, going to bingo once a week and having her friends around for coffee.
Apart from her shoulder problem, her health has been good and physical examination and  删除换行1 blood tests (full blood count, renal, liver, thyroid and lipid profiles and HbA1c) have all been  删除换行1 normal. She is on no other medication apart from the paracetamol.

【3】She tells the GP that, over the past 2–3 weeks, she has been suffering from general pain and  删除换行1 stiffness, particularly in her thighs and both shoulders. Her GP is tempted to put this down  删除换行1 to her sadness and isolation as well as lack of exercise owing to her sore shoulder and fear of  删除换行1 going outside since she was mugged 删除25：<u></u>. However, the GP asks the patient to explain  删除换行1 her symptoms in more detail. She reports that these symptoms started quite suddenly and  删除换行1 that, in the morning when she wakes up, she has really bad and painful generalized stiffness, making it hard to move and that this stiffness lasts for at least an hour before easing. It  删除换行1 makes it particularly hard for her to walk up and down stairs and raise her good arm to get  删除换行1 dressed. After sitting for any length of time, the stiffness also becomes a real problem. She  删除换行1 is not feeling very well, has lost some weight and sometimes even feels that she is running a  删除换行1 bit of a fever. She has not had any recent respiratory tract or other infection and has not been  删除换行1 suffering from headaches. At times, the symptoms wake her at night and prevent her from  删除换行1 turning over in bed.

【6】• What other questions and examination should the GP focus on?

【7】• What investigations might help?

【8】ANSWER 60

【9】The most probable diagnosis in this patient’s case is polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR). Other  删除换行1 possibilities are rheumatoid arthritis or other connective tissue disease, multiple myeloma  删除换行1 and depression.The GP should enquire about and carry out a full examination of the musculoskeletal system, particularly palpating the muscles for signs of tenderness, palpating the temporal  删除换行1 muscles to look for temporal arteritis and examining the peripheral joints for any synovitis. Investigations will include a full blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR),  删除换行5 C-reactive protein (CRP, usually raised with PMR) and liver function test (may be raised  删除换行1 alkaline phosphatase with PMR). In this case, the GP is fairly certain the diagnosis is PMR  删除换行5 as the woman is in the right age group, has muscle tenderness in the upper arms, prolonged  删除换行1 morning stiffness, an acute illness and weight loss. If the GP is not certain, additional tests  删除换行1 can include protein electrophoresis to exclude a myeloma, and rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibody to look for rheumatoid arthritis or other connective tissue disease. The  删除换行1 patient’s erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) comes back at 50 mm/hour and her CRP at  删除换行1 10 mg/L. The GP starts her on 15 mg prednisolone a day, which brings rapid relief of symptoms within a few days. In view of her age, and the risk of osteoporosis with the use of oral  删除换行1 steroids for over three months the patient is also given a bisphosphonate to be given as long  删除换行1 as the steroids are used. Over the next 18 months, she continues on a tapering dose of steroids  删除换行1 and her blood tests revert to normal.

【10】• Multiple pathologies can occur.

【11】• Do not blame everything on depression.

【12】• A trial of medication is sometimes a very useful diagnostic tool.

【13】• Watch out for iatrogenic disease such as osteoporosis.
