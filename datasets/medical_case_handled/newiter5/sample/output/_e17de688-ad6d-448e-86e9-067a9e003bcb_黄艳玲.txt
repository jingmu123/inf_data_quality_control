【0】Question: A 25-year-old woman comes to her physician complaining of pain with intercourse and dysmenorrhea that worsens one-two days before her period starts. Ultrasonography reveals unilateral adnexal masses, and laparoscopy shows reddish-brown cysts on the ovaries. This patient is at increased risk for developing which of the following conditions?

【1】> (A) Carcinoma

【2】> (B) Infertility

【3】> (C) Intracranial hemorrhage

【4】> (D) Masculinization

【5】> (E) Obesity

【6】 Answer: The correct answer is B. A blood-filled cyst (a so-called chocolate cyst) is characteristic of endometriosis, a condition that results in non-neoplastic endometrial glands/stroma being abnormally located outside the endometrial cavity. The ovary and the pelvic peritoneum are the most common sites. The cysts are formed during cyclic bleeding from the tissue, mimicking menstruation. Severe menstrualrelated pain (dysmenorrhea), pain during sexual intercourse (dyspareunia), and infertility are possible complications of endometriosis.  
Answer A is incorrect. Common cancers in the reproductive tract include endometrial carcinoma, which can arise from endometrial hyperplasia caused by excess estrogen stimulation, and cervical carcinoma, associated with human papillomavirus infection. Endometriosis does not progress to cancer.  
Answer C is incorrect. Autosomal dominant (adult) polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is characterized by bilaterally enlarged kidneys with multiple cysts. Cysts can also involve the liver, pancreas, heart, and brain. This disease manifests as renal abnormalities that progresses to end stage renal disease. In patients with ADPKD there is usually a family history, bilateral involvement, and constant pain that does not wax and wane in conjunction with menstrual cycles. Another manifestation of ADPKD is the emergence of intracranial berry aneurysms that can rupture and produce intracranial hemorrhage. Endometriosis is not associated with ADPKD.  
Answer D is incorrect. Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS or Stein-Leventhal syndrome) has many causes. The main characteristics of PCOS are irregular or anovulation and hyperandrogenism. Features seen in PCOS include ovarian cysts, amenorrhea, infertility, obesity, and hirsutism caused by excess LH and androgens. In some women this is associated with insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, which increases androgen production in the ovarian theca cells and, secondarily, LH production. The insulin resistance also leads to hyperglycemia and suppresses hepatic steroid hormone binding globulin (SHBG) synthesis. The decrease in SHBG along with the increase in androgen production leads to a vicious cycle of amenorrhea and infertility. Endometriosis is not associated with masculinization and PCOS.  
Answer E is incorrect. Endometriosis is not associated with obesity.黄艳玲
