【0】Which of the following single best direct mechanisms for amenorrhea (A-H) best matches the clinical situations described (30.1-30.6)?

【1】A1.Gonadotropin receptor insensitivity

【2】B. Pituitary dysfunction

【3】C. Ovarian failure

【4】D. Ovarian cortical atrophy syndrome

【5】E. Peritoneal interference with ovulation

【6】F. H ypothalamic dysfunction

【7】G. Estrogen excess

【8】H. Immune downregulation of ovary

【9】30.1A 51-year-old woman with oligomenorrhea and hot flushes.

【10】30.22 A 22-year-old nonpregnant woman with hyperprolactinemia due to psycho-tropic medication use.

【11】30.3A 25-year-old woman slightly obese， slightly hirsute， and with a long history of irregular menses.

【12】30.4An 18-year-old adolescent female with infantile breast development who has not started her menses. She has some webbing of the neck region.

【13】30.5 F A 19-year-old nonpregnant woman marathon runner with amenorrhea.

【14】30.6 A 33-year-old woman who has not started her menses since a vaginal delivery1 year previously complicated by postpartum hemorrhage. She was unable to breast-feed her baby.

【15】30.7A 25-year-old woman has a history of 1 year of amenorrhea due to hyper-prolactinemia. She has bilateral galactorrhea due to a prolactin-secreting adenoma. Which of the following tests is also likely to reveal an abnormal finding?
A.DEXA scan of the spine
增加换行2:B.Endometrial biopsy

【16】C. Mammography of the breasts

【17】D. Thyroid-stimulating hormone level

【18】30.1 C. Ovarian failure due to follicular atresia is the reason for oligo-ovulation in the perimenopausal years. During perimenopause (or climacteric)， follicular atresia occurs from hypoestrogenemia， as do the vasomotor changes that lead to hot flushes. There is nothing dysfunctional occurring in this scenario， as it is a common occurrence in a perimenopausal patient.

【19】30.2IF. Both hypothyroidism and hyperprolactinemia may cause hypothalamic dysfunction， which inhibits gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) pul-sations， which in turn inhibit pituitary FSH and LH release. The lack of gonadotropins，FSH and LH， leads to hypoestrogenic amenorrhea. A com-mon cause ofhyperprolactinemia in a girl of this age is a prolactinoma. This is not a pituitary problem， nor a receptor insensitivity issue. There is no pathol-ogy related to the ovaries； however， this patient will most likely be amenor-rheic due to the lack of stimulation to the ovaries by the gonadotropins.

【20】30.33(G. This patient most likely has polycystic ovarian syndrome(PCOS). Women with PCOS often are obese and hirsute， have anovulation and insulin resis-tance， but an estrogen excess. Because of this， they are often prescribed pro-gesterone alone or combination oral contraceptive pills to induce vaginal bleeding and to prevent endometrial hyperplasia.

【21】30.4 C. Ovarian failure is the most likely etiology in this woman with probable Turner syndrome (45，X). It would be reflected by elevated gonadotropin lev-els and streaked ovaries. She most likely has decreased estrogen levels as well， which predisposes her to complications such as osteoporosis later in life. This patient's symptoms result from a chromosomal abnormality and not a hypo-thalamic or pituitary dysfunction.

【22】30.5 F. Excessive exercise may lead to hypothalamic dysfunction， but many times simple weight gain will lead to its restoration of function. This patient has amenorrhea， and therefore is in a hypoestrogenic state. This puts this patient at an increased risk of bone fractures. The “female athlete triad”of eating disorder， amenorrhea， and osteoporosis is associated with hypothalamic dys-function and hypoestrogenemia. Many times these individuals are placed on oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) in order to maintain normal hypothalamic function. There is no pathology related to the ovaries or pituitary in this scenario.

【23】30.6 B. Sheehan syndrome is when the anterior pituitary suffers from hem-orrhagic necrosis associated with postpartum hemorrhage. She is unable to breast-feed due to her inability to release prolactin from the anterior pituitary. This patients symptoms are unrelated to the ovaries and hypo-thalamus. This patient would be in a hypoestrogenic state due to the lack of gonadotropin stimulation. Treatment for this would be supplemental hormonal replacement.

【24】30.77A. Amenorrhea due to hyperprolactinemia causes a hypoestrogenic state due to decreased GnRH release， and decreased FSH and LH secretion. O var-ian estrogen levels are decreased， leading to decreased bone mineral den-sity. Hence， the DEXA scan is most likely to be abnormal. The endometrial biopsy is likely to be normal， or perhaps show atrophic changes due to the hypoestrogenic state， and certainly not likely to show hyperplasia or cancer. The mammogram would not be affected. The thyroid gland is not affected by hyperprolactinemia； rather， hypothyroidism can lead to hyperprolactinemia， not vice versa.

【25】CLINICALPEARLS
Hot flushes and irregular menses after the age of 45 years are most likely due to the climacteric state (or perimenopause). These symptoms usu-ally respond to estrogen recommended to be given as a combination of estrogen and progestin (HRT).

【26】Significant vasomotor symptoms are the current indication for hormone-replacement therapy in the menopausal woman， and the lowest dose should be used for the shortest duration feasible.
The most common location of an osteoporosis-associated fracture is the thoracic spine as a compression fracture.
 Weight-bearing exercise， calcium and vitamin D supplementation， and estrogen-replacement therapy are the important cornerstones in the prevention of osteoporosis.
Progestin should be added to estrogen-replacement therapy when a woman has her uterus， to prevent endometrial cancer.

【27】删除38：<u>)</u>Continuous estrogen-progestin therapy may be associated with a small but significant risk of cardiovascular disease and breast cancer.The sequence of biochemical markers in the life of the ovary is as follows：AMH falls first， inhibin Bnext， and then finally estradiol.

【28】Pregnancy should be ruled out in any patient who presents with amenorrhea.黄艳玲
