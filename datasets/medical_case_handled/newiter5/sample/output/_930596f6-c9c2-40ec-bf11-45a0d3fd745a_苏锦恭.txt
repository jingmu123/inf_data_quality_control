【0】CASE 67: sudden calf pain

【1】History

【2】A 31-year-old man attends the emergency department complaining of pain affecting his left  删除换行1 calf. He was playing squash when he suddenly felt as though he had been hit on the back of the  删除换行1 ankle. A loud snapping sound accompanied the pain.

【3】Examination

【4】Examination of the left foot and ankle reveals no obvious deformity. There is tenderness over  删除换行1 the calf and posterior aspect of the ankle. There is a full passive range of movement of the  删除换行1 foot,  ankle and knee joints. There are normal foot pulses, and neurological examination is  删除换行1 unremarkable.

【5】Questions

【6】• What clinical test is being demonstrated on a normal leg in Figure 67.1?

【7】• What is the likely diagnosis in this patient?

【8】• What investigation can be performed if the diagnosis is in question?

【10】ANSWER 67

【11】The clinical test that is being demonstrated is the ‘Simmonds test’. It describes the absence of  删除换行1 ankle plantar flexion when the calf is compressed. This picture demonstrates normal plantar  删除换行1 flexion with calf compression on the right leg.

【12】Failure of plantar flexion indicates that the patient has ruptured his Achilles tendon. The history  删除换行1 of sudden pain affecting the calf during sporting activity is typical. Other examination findings  删除换行1 may include a palpable gap in the Achilles tendon and an inability to actively plantar flex the  删除换行1 ankle (i.e. the patient is unable to stand on ‘tip-toes’). The latter feature may be misleading, as  删除换行1 the deep flexors of the foot can compensate for this movement.

【13】An ultrasound scan can confirm a gap in the Achilles tendon when the diagnosis is in doubt.
Serial ultrasound scans can also be used to assess healing of the tendon. There is debate as to the  删除换行1 best way to treat this injury. Non-surgical management involves immobilizing the leg in a plaster  删除换行1 of Paris cast, with the foot initially in full plantar flexion. While this avoids the risks of surgery,  删除换行1 it delays functional rehabilitation and results in a greater risk of the tendon re-rupturing. The  删除换行1 tendon can be repaired surgically, which is thought to result in a stronger tendon repair. This  删除换行1 may be more appropriate for patients who require a greater level of sporting activity.

【14】KEY POINTS

【15】•	Ultrasound can be used to detect damage to the Achilles tendon.

【16】•	Simmonds test is diagnostic of an Achilles tendon rupture.删除个例：<u>Orthopaedic</u>苏锦恭
