【1】What Happens When the Endosymbionts “Bug Out”? 通用删除6(英):<u>\[2\]</u>
====================================================

【2】Introduction
------------

【3】Endosymbionts are organisms that form a symbiotic relationship with another cell or organism. Some endosymbionts can be found either inside cells (intracellular), while others attach to the surface of cells (extracellular). Symbiotic relationships are ones in which both parties benefit. In the example of corals, the host animal is a multicellular cnidarian, and the endosymbiont is a unicellular alga called a dinoflagellate. The host animal serves as a protected environment, providing the alga with a constant supply of nutrients in the form of nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur. In turn, the alga provides the host with glucose. Another important example of a beneficial relationship between a host and an endosymbiont is found in the roots of bean and pea plants. Bacteria called rhizobia colonize the root cells of plants forming nodules. Rhizobia bacteria convert atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia that the plant can use to build biological molecules. The conversion of nitrogen gas into ammonium, requires large amounts of ATP. Plants supply the bacteria with carbohydrates to help drive the reaction.

【4】▪ Explain how an alga endosymbiont could provide a host organism with glucose.

【5】▪ Describe how a symbiotic relationship might alter an organism’s phenotype.

【6】▪ What biological molecules require nitrogen?

【7】▪ Connect the activity of nitrogen-fixing rhizobia bacteria to the global nitrogen cycle.

【8】▪ The endosymbiotic theory explains the origin of mitochondria and chloroplasts. Speculate on the interactions between a host protoeukaryote and a protomitochondria or protochloroplast endosymbiont.苏锦恭
