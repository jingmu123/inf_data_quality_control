【29】ANSWERS

【30】14.11删除38：<u>(</u> C. This is a 66-year-old man with significant cardiopulmonary comorbidities andtypicalGERD-like symptoms that are partially relieved with an H2-blocker. Given this history of partial response， switching to a PPI is the best option at this time. Choice A is not a good answer because Nissen fundoplication may be risky for a patient with significant cardiopulmonary comorbidities； in addi-tion， operative treatment may not be needed as he has not yet received the best medical treatment. Esophageal physiology studies are appropriate to determine if GERD is the cause of his symptoms if he fails to respond to PPI treatment. Dietary recommendation should be provided for all patients but is not the best answer at this time. Reassurance is not an appropriate answer because the patients symptoms are not yet adequately addressed.
14.2 B. This is a 51-year-old woman with cardiac risk factors and symptoms suggestive of GERD. The patient has been taking a PPI without symp-toms relief. Given her history of cardiac comorbidity (hypertension and hyperlipidemia)， evaluations for her atypical chest pain are indicated. She would likely benefit from cardiac stress test and other cardiac evaluations to rule out coronary artery disease. This patient has a hiatal hernia which occurs commonly and may not have any relevance to her GERD symptoms； therefore， specific work-up of this is not indicated at this time. CT of the abdomen and pelvis can be helpful to identify mass lesions or other structural abnormalities responsible for her symptoms， but without additional symp-toms such as obstructive symptoms or constitutional symptoms， this imaging study is not indicated at this time. Esophageal pH monitoring is a test that could likely help us determine if the cause of her symptoms is GERD-related， but tests to rule out cardiac disease should be done first. Patients with acha-lasia can present with GERD-like symptoms； however， cardiac causes need to be ruled out first.

【31】14.3A. This 50-year-old man has a history of GERD and Barrett's esophagus without evidence of dysplasia. Patients with Barrett's esophagus should have treatment to optimally address their GERD； therefore， he should switched to a PPI which is a better pharmacologic choice than H2 antagonist treat-ment. Esophagectomy is an option for the management of patients with Barrett's esophagus containing severe dysplasia. Nissen fundoplication has not been proven to control Barretts esophagus progression better than PPI treatment.Misoprostol is helpful for gastric mucosal protection， especially in patients taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs， but this agent plays no role in preventing Barrett 's progression.

【32】14.4删除38：<u>(</u> C. Antisecretory treatment and Nissen fundoplications are effective in reduc-ing progression of Barrett’s in GERD patients； however， antireflux surgery is not proven to be more effective than PPI treatment. Unwillingness to continue with PPI treatment， incomplete response to PPI treatment， and inability to tolerate or pay for PPI treatments are all reasonable indications to consider antireflux surgery options.
14.5 A. Nissen fundoplication is contraindicated in a patient with gastroparesis， bloating， and GERD. Since the reflux of gastric contents in this situation is likely secondary to overdistension of the stomach produced by poor gas-tric motility， a fundoplication might reduce reflux symptoms but will cause worsening of bloating and distension. A displaced fundoplication causing symptoms is an indication for re-operation. A fundoplication procedure is an appropriate treatment option for a patient with Barrett’s changes with-out dysplasia or a patient with GERD and incomplete relief with medical treatment. Although not all patients with GERD are able to discontinue antisecretory therapy following fundoplication procedures， the procedure is not contraindicated for a patient who wishes to discontinue pharmacologic treatment.

【33】14.66 B. A 47-year-old man with dysphagia to solids and liquids and GERD-like symptoms could have achalasia. Patients with achalasia often have undigested and fermented food remaining in their esophagus secondary to esophageal dysmotility and poor esophageal emptying. Fermented food with bacterial overgrowth in the esophagus can cause esophagitis and GERD-like symp-toms. The patient with breakthrough of GERD-like symptoms following initial response to low-dose PPI treatment does not raise a suspicion for alternative causes of the symptoms； therefore， manometric study would not likely contribute to the care. The patient with incomplete healing of his duo-denal ulcer after a course of H. pylori treatment needs biopsy to see if the infection has been eradicated.

【34】CLINICALPEARLS
 A24-hour pHmonitoring study is the most objective indicator of GERD.

【35】Apatient's response to PPI is one ofthe best clinical indicators of GERD.

【36】Adenocarcinoma of the esophagus is a complication of long-standing GERD.

【37】Gastroparesis or delayed gastric emptying can cause GERD-like symp-toms， but these symptoms are usually accompanied by bloating and abdominal distension.

【38】The long-term efficacy of PPI and antireflux operations in reducing esophageal cancer develop in GERD patients appears to be equivalent.

【39】Achalasia can produce GERD-like symptoms because undigested and fermented food in the esophagus can produce esophag itis.
 Endoscopic or operative antireflux procedures are indicated in patients with documented GERD whose symptoms are incompletely controlled with PPI， or in patients who do not wish to continue or are unable to tol-erate long-term PPItreatment.
