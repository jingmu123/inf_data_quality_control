【0】Question: 13.1 As compared to stroke in patients younger than age 55, which of the following risk factors is more common in an individual older than age 55 years?

【1】A. Atrial fibrillation

【2】B. Patent foramen ovale

【3】C. Carotid dissection

【4】D. Moyamoya disease

【5】Answer: 13.1 A . Atrial fibrillation is more common in older adults. The other etiologies (carotid dissection, moyamoya, patent foramen ovale) should be considered in a young patient presenting with a stroke.

【6】Question: 13.2 A 45-year-old woman is brought into the emergency room with symptoms of a stroke. She has a history of two miscarriages and unexplained leg cramping. Which of the following is most likely to be present in this patient’s condition?

【7】A. Arteriovenous malformation

【8】B. Antiphospholipid antibodies

【9】C. Moyamoya disease

【10】D. Carotid dissection

【11】Answer: 13.2 B . Antiphospholipid syndrome is a known cause of arterial hypercoagulability. In a patient such as this who manifests other symptoms of the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, anticoagulation is appropriate. On the other hand, in a patient with an isolated lab value showing antiphospholipid antibodies and stroke, but no other symptoms, antiplatelet therapy has been proven to be as equally efficacious as anticoagulation.

【12】Question: 13.3 An 18-year-old man is seen by his pediatrician for right-sided arm weakness. The pediatrician is suspicious of a patent foramen ovale. Which of the following is the best examination to confirm this finding?

【13】A. Electrocardiogram (ECG)

【14】B. Auscultation of the heart

【15】C. Echocardiogram

【16】D. Arterial blood gas
Answer: 13.3 C . Transesophageal echocardiography is the best method to detect a patent foramen ovale.

【17】CLINICAL PEARLS

【18】 Horner syndrome in a patient with headache and recent head or neck injury suggests carotid or vertebral dissection.

【19】 An etiology often discovered in a young patient with cryptogenic stroke is a patent foramen ovale.

【20】 The young patient is more likely to have an “unusual” cause of stroke, although up to 16% of no etiology is found.

【21】 Three percent of cerebral infarcts occur in patients younger than 40 years of age.
