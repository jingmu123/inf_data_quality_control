【0】Question: ABO testing on a sample of B-positive blood and two unknown sample types (donor and recipient) is performed. Positive antibody-antigen interaction results in RBC agglutination. Five experiments are conducted for each sample, as shown in the image. Which of the following pairs represents the blood types for donor and recipient?

> (A) A-positive donor and O-negative recipient

【1】> (B) AB-negative donor and A-positive recipient

【2】> (C) AB-positive donor and B-negative recipient

【3】> (D) B-negative donor and AB-positive recipient

【4】> (E) O-negative donor and A-positive recipient

【5】> (F) O-positive donor and B-negative recipient

【6】 Answer: The correct answer is E . Because the donor’s RBCs do not agglutinate with anti-A or anti-B antibodies, the donor blood type must be O. The fact that donor sera agglutinates both A cells and B cells confirms this, because type O serum contains both anti-A and anti-B antibodies. By similar reasoning, the recipient must be blood type A. Anti-D agglutination implies that RBCs in a sample have the Rh antigen. Thus the donor is Rh negative, and the recipient is Rh positive. Hence the correct pair is an O-negative donor and A-positive recipient. Donor and recipient blood should always be cross-matched, because pre-formed antibodies in the recipient can lyse donor RBCs and vice versa. This immunologic response can culminate in an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction with sequelae of shock, pyrexia, and both chest and flank pain.  
Answer A is incorrect . Anti-A antibodies do not agglutinate donor RBCs. Thus the donor cannot be type A.  
Answer B is incorrect . Anti-A and anti-B antibodies do not agglutinate donor RBCs. Thus the donor cannot be type AB.  
Answer C is incorrect . Anti-A and anti-B antibodies do not agglutinate donor RBCs. Thus the donor cannot be blood type AB. No agglutination implies that the antigen is not present on the sample RBCs (hence this donor is type O). Both A and B RBCs are agglutinated in the donor serum, as expected, because anti-A and anti-B antibodies are generated in patients with blood type O.  
Answer D is incorrect . Anti-B antibodies do not agglutinate donor RBCs. Thus the donor cannot be type B .  
Answer F is incorrect . Donor RBCs do not agglutinate with either anti-A or anti-B antibody. Thus the donor blood type must be O. Because anti-D agglutination is negative, the donor must be Rh negative. The donor blood type is therefore O negative, not O positive.苏锦恭
