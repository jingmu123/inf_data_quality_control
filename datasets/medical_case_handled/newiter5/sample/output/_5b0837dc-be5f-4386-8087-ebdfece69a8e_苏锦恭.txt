【0】Question: A 56-year-old man who is a health care worker presents to his physician with vague abdominal discomfort. A physical examination reveals a tender liver, palpable to 6 cm below the costal margin and scleral icterus. His laboratory studies are significant for an aspartate aminotransferase activity of 200 U/L and an alanine aminotransferase activity of 450 U/L. CT of the abdomen shows a dominant solid nodule in the liver. The tumor marker most likely to be increased in this patient is also likely to be elevated in which of the following malignancies?

【1】> (A) Choriocarcinoma

【2】> (B) Colorectal carcinoma

【3】> (C) Melanoma

【4】> (D) Neuroblastoma

【5】> (E) Prostatic carcinoma

【6】> (F) Yolk sac carcinoma

【7】 Answer: The correct answer is F . This vignette suggests a hepatoma (hepatocellular carcinoma), which is associated with an elevated α-fetoprotein level. Hepatomas are highly associated with chronic HBV and HCV infections. Other risk factors include Wilson disease, hemochromatosis, alcoholic cirrhosis, α1 \-antitrypsin deficiency, and exposure to toxins and carcinogens such as aflatoxin. α-Fetoprotein is a marker for hepatomas, but levels can also be elevated in patients with germ cell tumors, such as yolk sac tumors. Yolk sac tumors (also known as endodermal sinus tumors) arise from the germ cells that eventually become the adult gonads. Yolk sac tumors are the most common malignant testicular and ovarian tumors in children. Remember, tumor markers should not be used to make the primary diagnosis, but for confirmation and to monitor the response to therapy.  
Answer A is incorrect . The marker for choriocarcinoma is β-hCG. This marker is also elevated with hydatidiform moles and gestational trophoblastic tumors. Hepatomas are not known to elevate β-hCG levels.  
Answer B is incorrect . The marker for colorectal carcinoma is carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). This marker is nonspecific and is also produced by pancreatic, gastric, and breast carcinomas. Most tumors of endoderm origin can release CEA excluding hepatomas. However, secondary tumors in the liver from malignant colon cancer may also present with increased CEA levels.  
Answer C is incorrect . The marker for melanoma is S-100. This marker also is elevated with neuroendocrine tumors such as astrocytomas and even carcinoid tumors. Hepatomas are not known to elevate S-100 levels.  
Answer D is incorrect . The marker for neuroblastoma is bombesin. This marker also is elevated with lung and gastric cancers. Hepatomas are not known to elevate bombesin levels.  
Answer E is incorrect . The marker for prostatic carcinoma is prostate-specific antigen. Hepatomas are not known to elevate prostatespecific antigen levels.苏锦恭
