【0】CASE 10: INTRAVENOUS FLUID RESUSCITATION

【1】History

【2】A 48-year-old male was the driver in a head-on collision between two cars travelling at 45 miles  删除换行1 per hour. He has an open tibial fracture and a distended and bruised abdomen. During the primary survey in the Emergency Department, it is noted that he is hypotensive and tachycardic.

【3】A decision is made to initiate fluid resuscitation.

【4】Questions

【5】1. What is the content of 0.9% saline and Hartmann’s solution?

【6】2. How is water distributed in the body?

【7】3. How is 1 L of crystalloid fluid distributed in the body? How is 1 L of 5% dextrose  删除换行1 solution distributed in the body? How is 1 L of blood distributed in the body?

【8】DISCUSSION

【9】Intravenous fluids can be divided into crystalloids and colloids. Crystalloids are made up of  删除换行1 water-soluble molecules (e.g. saline solution, Hartmann’s solution). Colloid fluids contain  删除换行1 insoluble molecules (e.g. Gelofusin, which contains gelatin).

【10】Saline solution (0.9% sodium chloride) contains both sodium (154 mmol/L) and chloride  删除换行1 (154 mmol/L). Hartmann’s solution contains the following: sodium 131 mmol/L, chloride 111  删除换行1 mmol/L, potassium 5 mmol/L, calcium 2 mmol/L and bicarbonate 29 mmol/L (which is supplied in the form of lactate, which is then metabolised to bicarbonate).

【11】Sixty percent percent of the human body mass is composed of water, of which two-thirds lies  删除换行1 in the intracellular compartment and one-third lies in the extracellular compartment. The  删除换行1 extracellular compartment is further subdivided into interstitial fluid (75%) and intravascular fluid (25%). Thus, a 70 kg human will have 42 L of total body water (60% of mass), of which  删除换行1 28 L (two-thirds) is intracellular and 14 L (one-third) is extracellular. Of the extracellular  删除换行1 water, 10.5 L (75%) is interstitial and 3.5 L (25%) is intravascular fluid.

【12】To calculate what volume of 1 L of crystalloid such as saline 0.9% or Hartmann’s solution enters the intravascular space, the above principles apply. The sodium content of both  删除换行1 of these fluids is similar to plasma, which means the entire 1 L of fluid will be distributed amongst the extracellular compartment. Thus, 750 mL (75%) will be interstitial, and  删除换行1 250 mL (25%) will be intravascular. Five percent of dextrose or glucose solutions are distributed relative to total body water, so that 666.6 mL is intracellular and 333.3 mL is extracellular. Of the extracellular fluid, 250 mL is interstitial and 83.3 mL is intravascular. Of note,  删除换行1 when administering a blood transfusion, all of the content is distributed in the intravascular  删除换行1 space, making it ideal for hypotensive resuscitation.
The disadvantage of using colloids such as Gelofusin is that they contain insoluble proteins that can cause bleeding disorders, interfere with blood cross-matching and may lead  删除换行1 to anaphylaxis. Although colloids provide more initial intravascular expansion, it is now  删除换行1 accepted that there is no significant difference in reducing mortality when using crystalloids  删除换行1 or colloids for fluid resuscitation. This was demonstrated in the Saline versus Albumin Fluid  删除换行5 Evaluation (SAFE) Study 通用删除7(英):<u>(2004)</u>, which showed that albumin (colloid) and saline (crystalloid) 删除换行1 should be considered clinically equivalent treatments for intravascular volume resuscitation  删除换行1 in a heterogeneous population of patients in the Intensive Care Unit. Further studies on fluid  删除换行1 resuscitation of patients with traumatic brain injury have shown that colloids are associated  删除换行1 with a higher mortality than crystalloids.

【13】Key Points

【14】• When resuscitating a hypotensive patient, using 1 L of crystalloid will equate to 250  删除换行1 mL of intravascular fluid; using 1 L of dextrose 5% will equate to less than 100 mL 

【15】of intravascular fluid; and using 1 L of blood will equate to 1 L of intravascular fluid.

【16】• Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) guidelines and the SAFE study recommend  删除换行1 crystalloid instead of colloid fluid resuscitation. Crystalloids are cheaper and do  删除换行1 not exhibit the same disadvantages (blood clotting disorders and anaphylaxis) as  删除换行1 colloids.苏锦恭
