【16】Questions

【17】• How would you manage this patient’s initial withdrawal?

【18】• What other management should be considered?
ANSWER 22

【19】Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid and its prodrug, g-butyrolactone (GBL), are now among the  删除换行1 most commonly used recreational drugs in UK clubs. They are central nervous system  删除换行1 depressants and can have both euphoric and sedative effects. They are highly addictive  删除换行1 when used in high quantities. GHB/GBL users who use large quantities of the drug may  删除换行1 require very frequent doses and rapidly start to withdraw within a few hours without 

【20】GHB/GBL.
Withdrawal from GHB/GBL can be life-threatening. It is often managed in a level 2  删除换行1 setting and can last for around 10–14 days. As with alcohol withdrawal, patients often  删除换行1 require benzodiazepines, but sometimes in very high doses, so they must be monitored  删除换行1 closely for respiratory depression. Buscopan, an antispasmodic, is also very effective in  删除换行1 managing GHB/GBL withdrawal symptoms. As people using high volumes of GHB/GBL  删除换行5 can rapidly deteriorate, advice from the local toxicology team should be sought wherever  删除换行1 possible and the high-dependency team should be made aware of the patient.

【21】Long-term support should be offered wherever possible to help patients remain free of  删除换行1 drugs and alcohol. There are numerous addiction support groups available in the community and information about these should be given before the patient is discharged. Many  删除换行1 hospitals have substance misuse teams that can support patients both in hospital and  删除换行1 back in the community and provide information about accessing rehabilitation facilities.

【22】KEY POINTS

【23】• GHB and GBL are now among the leading recreational drugs used in the UK.

【24】• Withdrawal from GHB/GBL can be life-threatening and begins after only a few hours  删除换行1 of stopping the drug in people who use large quantities.

【25】• Advice should be sought from the hospital high-dependency team and, if available, a  删除换行1 toxicology team.王磊
