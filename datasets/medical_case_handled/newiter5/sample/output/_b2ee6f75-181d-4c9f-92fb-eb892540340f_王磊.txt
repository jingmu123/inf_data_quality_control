【7】All skin lesions that are concerning for malignant melanoma should be biopsied. Tissue biopsy helps confirm the diagnosis as well as determine the tumor thick-ness. Accurate tumor depth assessment is vital for patients with malignant melano-mas because this information provides prognostic information and serves as a guide for treatment. During the initial biopsy， it is important to take a full-thickness skin biopsy， which provides important microstaging information. It is unnecessary and undesirable to take a wide margin during the initial biopsy， because the size of the margin for definitive treatment is dictated by tumor thickness. Once the biopsy demonstrates melanoma and the depth of penetration is determined， the patient will need a second procedure to excise the surgical bed with an appropriate skin margin. Patients with intermediate depth melanomas (1.0-4.0 mm) should also undergo lymphoscintigraphy and SLNB to assess for regional spread of disease， because selected patients with disease involvement in the regional lymph nodes benefit from therapeutic lymph node dissection.BRESLOW MEASUREMENT： Measures the primary tumor in millimeters. This measurement is taken from the top of the epidermal granular layer to the base. In cases of ulcerated tumors， the measurement is taken from the base of the ulcer to the bottom of the tumor. Stage I is <0.75 mm； stage II is 0.75 to 1.5 mm； stage III is 1.51 to 2.25 mm； stage IV is 2.25 to 3.0 mm； stage V is>3.0 mm.

In 2014， the incidence of mela-noma in the United States is estimated at 76，000， with 9700 projected deaths from the disease. Currently， melanoma accounts for 4% of all newly diagnosed cancers in the United States and responsible for 1% of all cancer deaths. Melanoma is the fifth most common cancer in men and the seventh most common cancer in women in the United States. Risk factors for melanoma include family history， sun exposure， dysplastic nevus， a history of blistering sunburns， prior history of melanoma， and fair complexion. Patients with these risk factors should have thorough skin exam-inations on a regular basis by a trained healthcare professional. Suspicious skin lesions may be recognized based on ABCDE (Asymmetry， Borders， Color， large Diameter， and Enlargement or Elevation) characteristics .

【9】The four types of melanoma are 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> superficial spreading， 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> nodular sclerosing， 删除换行1 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> lentigo maligna， and 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> acral lentiginous. By far， the most common form is the superficial spreading， which accounts for 70% of all melanoma cases. This type of lesion has a slight female predominance and typically has a prolonged radial growth phase (1-10 years) and a late vertical growth phase. In comparison to the other forms of melanomas， the superficial spreading type has a more favorable prognosis with the exception of the lentigomaligna type. Nodular sclerosing is the second most

The lentigo maligna variant occurs in approximately 4% to 10% of patients and has a prolonged radial growth phase (5-15 years) with a better prognosis. Acral lentiginous type represents35%to 60%of the melanoma cases seen in African Americans， Asians， and Hispanics. These lesions occur primarily on the palms and soles of the hands and feet and in nail beds.

【11】Melanoma incidence is directly related to sun exposure. To minimize sun damage，patients are advised to avoid sun exposure between the hours of 10 AM to 4 PM， seek shade， and apply sunscreen liberally. Additional protective mea-sures include the application of titanium dioxide or zinc oxide for ultraviolet A(UVA) protection.

【12】Once a suspicious lesion is recognized， the next steps are to perform a thorough search for other skin lesions and then perform a biopsy. Biopsy goals are to deter-mine the histological diagnosis， and in the case of melanoma， identify the depth or thickness of the tumor (microstaging). Excisional biopsy can be performed for small lesions. For lesions that are larger or are in a cosmetically sensitive area， a full-thickness punch biopsy of the thickest portion of the lesion should be performed. When performing extremity biopsies， the skin incisions should be oriented in the longitudinal directions. Once the thickness of the primary tumor has been deter-mined by biopsy， a wide-local excision should be performed with margin size based on the tumor depth 删除25：<u></u>.

【13】The regional lymph node basin is the most common first area of melanoma spread， and the sentinel lymph node(s) is/ are the first node(s) where metastatic dis-ease occurs. The probability of nodal involvement increases with increasing thick-ness of the primary tumor. Surgical lymphadenectomy is the primary therapy for patients with nodal involvement. Prior to the introduction of the SLNB technique in the late 1980s， patients with intermediate thickness (1-4 mm) melanomas often underwent prophylactic lymph node dissections， which often contributed to lymph-edema in the affected area/ extremity. Following the introduction of SLNB in the late 1980s， patients with intermediate thickness melanoma first undergo SLNB to identify lymph node metastasis， and therapeutic lymph node dissections is only per-formed if SLN Bs reveale positive node(s) .

【15】\More extensive local excision for melanomas >4 mm in depth is not always associated with improved survival because ofthe increased rates ofregional and distant metastases associated with these thick tumors.

【17】The Multicenter Sentinel Lymphadenectomy Trial I (MSLT-I) published in2006 reported the findings of a randomized controlled trial of patients with pri-mary melanomas >1 mm in depth and no clinical nodal disease. The patients were randomized to clinical observation versus SLNB. When SLNB was positive or when clinical nodal recurrences occurred， the patients underwent therapeutic lymph node dissections. Overall， there was no difference in patient survival between the two treatment arms； however， when patients with positive SLNB were compared to patients randomized to initial observation and subsequently developed clini-cal nodal disease， those patients randomized to initial SLNB were found to have improved overall survival. The observations from this trial verified the accuracy of the SLNB technique for patients with melanoma and suggested that early identifi-cation and treatment of microscopic nodal disease offered an advantage over initial observation alone. Subset analysis of the MSLT-I trial suggests that patients with intermediate thickness melanomas (defined as 1.2-3.5 mm) benefited the most from early therapeutic lymph node dissections. The MSLT-II trial is currently ongoing， and is designed to assess the actual benefits of therapeutic lymph node dissection 删除换行1 in patient with primary melanoma >1.2 mm and positive SLNBs. Patients fitting these inclusion criteria are being randomized to immediate complete lymph node dissection versus ultrasound surveillance of the lymph node basin. Results of the MSLT-II should provide additional evidence to determine the subsets of patients with microscopic lymph node involvement who would benefit from therapeutic lymph node dissections.

【18】Unfortunately， patients with thick melanomas and melanomas with regional lymph node involvements are at high risk for systemic disease recurrence. For those patients with confirmed lymph node metastasis， the initial evaluation with CT scans or PET scans can be helpful in identifying occult distant metastasis. Adju-vant therapy with interferon-2A (Intron-A) is a therapeutic option for patients with stage III melanoma， but is associated significant side-effects on the patients’physical and emotional well-being. There are several options currently offered for patients presenting with melanoma with distant metastasis. These include surgical excision for isolated distant disease， dacarbazine， interleukin-2 (IL-2)， and biologic response modifier such as ipilimumab (an anticytotoxic T-cell antigen 4 monoclo-nal antibody) and vemurafenib (BRAF inhibitor). The selection of optimal treat-ment options for patients with advanced diseases is not well-defined and needs to be individualized.Follow-up of patients after surgical resection of melanomas is important because recurrences commonly occur， especially for patients with thick melanomas or nodal disease involvement. Patients with melanomas have an increased risk of developing a second melanoma， basal cell carcinomas， and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin. The overall risk of developing a second melanoma is in the range of 5% to10% over the patient s lifetime. Therefore， all melanoma patients require life-long dermatologic surveillance. Recommended laboratory surveillance during routine follow-up include， CBC， liver functions test， and LDH which may indicate meta-static recurrences .
