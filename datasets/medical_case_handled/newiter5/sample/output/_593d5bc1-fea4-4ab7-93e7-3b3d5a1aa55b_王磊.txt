【1】CASE REPORT

【2】A 60-year-old male, bidi smoker (pack year 18) was admitted to our department with  删除换行1 complaints of left-sided chest pain for 2-month duration; dry cough, and breathlessness  删除换行1 for 1 month duration; and about 6 kg weight loss over 4 weeks. The pain was moderate in  删除换行1 intensity, constant, and localized primarily to the upper part of the chest wall both anteriorly  删除换行1 and posteriorly. The pain increased to some extent on movement. Since the last 2 years,  删除换行1 he was diabetic and was on oral hypoglycemic drugs. Physical examination revealed mild  删除换行1 pallor. His chest radiograph revealed opacity in the left lung with a widened mediastinum  删除换行1 and obliteration of the left costophrenic angle and erosion of the left second and third  删除换行1 rib 删除33：<u></u>. A computed tomographic scan of the thorax (CT thorax) revealed mass in the  删除换行4 anterior segment of the left upper lobe with irregular margins measuring 4 × 5 × 3 cm in  删除换行1 size and a pleural effusion on the left side. The lesion was infiltrating the pleura. There was  删除换行1 also present a large mass with irregular margins in the prevascular region of the anterior  删除换行1 mediastinum infiltrating the mediastinal pleura. Multiple mediastinal lymph nodes were  删除换行1 present and fewer of them conglomerated suggestive of extracapsular spread of the disease.

There was an osteolytic lesion in the body of D10 vertebra 删除33：<u></u>. Biopsy of the lung mass  删除换行1 revealed atypical plasma cells arranged in sheets along with pulmonary parenchymal cells  删除换行1 suggestive of malignant myeloma. Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of the osteolytic  删除换行1 lesion of the body of D10 vertebra revealed plasma cell infiltration. The patient had also  删除换行1 complained of backache and hence we carried out an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 删除换行1 of the spine which revealed a diffuse and patchy altered signal intensity with the collapse  删除换行1 of sixth cervical and first lumbar vertebra, with the picture suggestive of diffuse marrow  删除换行1 infiltration indicative of multiple myeloma (MM) 删除33：<u></u>. His skull X-ray revealed  删除换行1 multiple lytic lesions. Serum protein electrophoresis was done which revealed raised  删除换行1 total proteins (11 g/dL) (normal 6.5–8.5 g/dL) with normal albumin, α1, α2, ad β globulin  删除换行1 but markedly raised g globulin (5 g/dL) (normal 0.75–1.8 g/dL), and the electrophoresis  删除换行1 showed an M-spike. Serum immunoglobulin determination revealed markedly raised IgG

【4】(normal 1,010–1,730 ng/mL). Urinary examination for Bence Jones proteins was negative.
Bone marrow biopsy revealed a hypocellular marrow with >25% plasma cells. Thus, diagnosis  删除换行1 of MM with extramedullary dissemination into the lung was made on the basis of plasma  删除换行1 cell infiltration of the bone marrow, the lytic bone lesions, the presence of monoclonal  删除换行1 immunoglobulins in the serum, and the myeloma plasma cells in the lung mass. The patient  删除换行1 was planned to be referred to the oncology department for chemotherapy but was not willing  删除换行1 to undergo any form of definitive treatment; he ultimately expired.

DISCUSSION

【6】Multiple myeloma may manifest as a diffuse bony disease (myelomatosis), as a solitary  删除换行1 plasmacytoma of bone, or as extramedullary (extraosseous) plasmacytoma. Myeloma  删除换行1 cells found at the extramedullary site may thus either be due to extramedullary  删除换行1 plasmacytoma or due to extramedullary dissemination of MM. Extramedullary  删除换行1 plasmacytoma is a variant of MM. It usually involves submucosal lymphoid tissues  删除换行1 of nasopharynx or paranasal sinuses without bone marrow involvement. It is highly  删除换行1 responsive to local irradiation and has excellent prognosis. Extramedullary dissemination  删除换行1 of MM occurs in advanced disease but is a rare phenomenon. The sites of extramedullary  删除换行1 dissemination reported in the literature are spleen, liver, lymph nodes, kidneys, thyroid  删除换行1 gland, adrenal gland, ovary, testes, lung, pleura, pericardium, intestinal tract, and skin.
Lung involvement is extremely rare. In fact, it is so rare that in one large case series of  删除换行1 869 cases, there was no mention of lung involvement. Shin et al. had described two cases  删除换行1 of extramedullary plasmacytoma involving the lung parenchyma. The first case had  删除换行1 a mass lesion in the right infrahilar region while the second case had reticulonodular  删除换行1 opacities in the lower zones of both lungs. The first case did not have generalized  删除换行1 myelomatosis but he developed it 5 years after treatment, namely, local radiotherapy,  删除换行1 while the second case had generalized myelomatosis. Because it is a disorder of the aged  删除换行1 population, with its severe clinical course and heterogeneous symptoms, the diagnosis  删除换行1 is difficult. This disorder presents primarily in the elderly with organ dysfunctions and  删除换行1 symptoms such as bone pains, renal dysfunction, anemia, susceptibility to infections,  删除换行1 hypercalcemia, hyperviscosity, and neurological manifestations. The most frequent  删除换行1 thoracic involvement by MM is pulmonary infiltrate secondary to an infectious process.
In our patient, after encountering atypical plasma cells in lung parenchyma, we first  删除换行1 investigated in order to find out whether he was having extramedullary plasmacytoma  删除换行1 or MM with extramedullary dissemination since the treatment and prognosis of  删除换行1 these two conditions are vastly different. For the diagnosis of MM, at least two of the  删除换行1 following three criteria should be present: Marrow plasmacytosis, lytic bone lesions,  删除换行1 and M component, i.e. monoclonal immunoglobulin in blood and/or urine. In our 100 Cases in Pulmonary Medicine Pulmonary and Nodal Multiple Myeloma with a Pleural Effusion.

【7】patient, all the three were present. In a recent study to investigate the causes, and the  删除换行1 frequency and the effects of prognosis of the pulmonary involvement, it was found that  删除换行1 the cases with pulmonary involvement were associated with progressive diseases, which  删除换行1 included mainly renal failure and pathological bone fractures. Despite advances in the  删除换行1 management of MM in the past few decades, it remains an incurable disease. The disease  删除换行1 follows a relapsing course in majority of patients, regardless of the treatment regimen  删除换行1 or initial response to treatment. Traditionally, newly diagnosed myeloma patients have  删除换行1 been classified as either transplant or nontransplant candidates. This classification  删除换行1 is based on a number of factors including age, performance status, comorbid medical  删除换行1 conditions, and patient performance. Transplant candidates were typically treated  删除换行1 with nonalkylating agents to prevent marrow damage. Nontransplant candidates often  删除换行1 received alkylating agent-based therapy (most oncologists prefer cyclophosphamide or  删除换行1 melphalan as an alkylating agent with prednisolone). However, cyclophosphamide is  删除换行1 preferred more because it is less toxic to the bone marrow. These agents are administered  删除换行1 over 4 days every 4 weeks till the disease reaches a plateau phase which is defined as  删除换行1 the phase when patient’s hemoglobin, paraprotein, and beta-2 microglobulin levels have  删除换行1 become stable, and the patient is asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic over a period  删除换行1 of at least 3 months. Lately, a high-dose alkylating agent with hematopoietic support has  删除换行1 been used. It has improved the remission rate from <10–50%. However, such therapy is  删除换行1 suitable for younger patients only. Recently, the management of patients with MM has  删除换行1 been transformed by introduction of three novel agents: Thalidomide, lenalidomide, and  删除换行1 bortezomib. We have reported the above case in order to demonstrate variability in the  删除换行1 presentation of MM.王磊
