【0】CASE 15

【1】A 58-year-old man comes to your office because of shortness of breath. He has experienced mild dyspnea on exertion for a few years， but more recently he has noted worsening shortness of breath with minimal exercise and the onset of dyspnea at rest. He has difficulty reclining； as a result， he spends the night sitting up in a chair trying to sleep. He reports a cough with production of yellowish-brown sputum every morning throughout the year. He denies chest pain， fever， chills， or lower extremity edema. He has smoked about two packs of cigarettes per day since age 15. He does not drink alcohol. A few months ago， the patient went to an urgent care clinic for evaluation of his symptoms， and he received a prescription for some inhalers， the names of which he does not remember. He was also told to find a primary care provider for further evaluation. On physical examination， his blood pressure is 135/85 mm Hg， heart rate is 96 beats per minute (bpm)， respiratory rate is 28 breaths/min， and temperature is 97.6 °F.He is sitting in a chair， leaning forward， with his arms braced on his knees. He appears uncomfortable， with labored respirations and cyanotic lips. He is using accessory muscles of respiration， and chest examination reveals wheezes and rhonchi bilaterally， but no crackles are noted. The anteroposterior (AP) diameter of the chest wall appears increased，and he has inward movement of the lower rib cage with inspiration. Cardiovascular examination reveals distant heart sounds but with a regular rate and rhythm， and his jugular venous pressure (JVP) is normal. His extremities show no cyanosis，edema， or clubbing.

He is now in respiratory distress with labored respirations， cyanosis， and wheezing. The urgent issue is his current respiratory status. Rapid clinical assessment is critical in case this patient is headed toward respiratory failure， perhaps necessitating endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. An ABG will quickly provide information regarding the adequacy of oxygenation status (Pao，) and ventilation (Paco，). A chest x-ray will determine the underlying status of the lung parenchyma and whether a trigger for the current situation can be identified.CHRONIC BRONCHITIS： COPD component that is diagnosed clinically and is characterized by excessive secretion of bronchial mucus and productive cough for3 months or more in at least 2 consecutive years in the absence of any other disease that might account for this symptom.

CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD)： Chronic air-flow obstruction caused by chronic bronchitis or emphysema.COPD is a prevent-able and treatable disease characterized by persistent airflow limitation that is usually progressive and associated with enhanced chronic inflammatory response in the lungs to noxious particles and gases. Diagnosis in the right clinical setting is usually supported by FEV /FVC ratio less than 0.7. Severity of COPD on spirom-etry is based on the level of FEV，/FVC ratio compared to the predicted value. The severity of airflow limitation can be classified based on postbronchodilator FEV.FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN 1 SECOND (FEV)： Volume of air expired in the first second during maximal expiratory effort. FEV is reduced in both obstructive lung disease (increased airway resistance) and restrictive lung dis-ease (low VC)

| GOLD 2  | Moderate  | 50%-79%  |

【9】Abbreviations：FEV。 forced expiratory volume in 1 second； GOLD， Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease.The most common etiology for COPD is inhalation injury， specifically cigarette smoking. Another important cause is alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency， which is hered-itary； pulmonary disease may become evident by age 40 and may occur without cough or smoking history. Therapy by replacement of alpha-1 antitrypsin enzyme is available. Characteristically， patients with COPD present with progressively worsening dyspnea (first on exertion， then with activity， then at rest). Patients may vary in appearance from a"blue bloater” (chronic bronchitis， overweight， edema-tous， cyanotic) to a"pink puffer" (emphysema， thin， ruddy cheeks).

【10】Arterial blood gases often are normal in the early phase of the disease； however， in more advanced disease， there is evidence of hypoxemia and hypercapnia， often with a chronic compensated respiratory acidosis as a consequence of CO， reten-tion. Such chronic stable patients may have a Pao， near 50 mm Hg and a Paco， near 50 mm Hg， but a near-normal pH (the“50-50" club). During an acute exac-erbation， more severe hypoxemia or hypercapnia， or respiratory acidosis noted on ABG， may be an indication of impending respiratory failure and need for ventila-tory support. Given an appropriate clinical context， general indications for measur-ing ABGs include low oxygen saturation on pulse oximetry (< 92%)， depressed level of consciousness， acute exacerbation， or assessment of hypercapnia in at-risk patients 30 to 60 minutes after supplemental oxygen is initiated.

Spirometry is the most basic， inexpensive， widely valuable PFT to diagnose pulmonary diseases 删除33：<u></u>. Spirometric tracings of forced expiration删除33：<u></u> and flow-volume loops 删除33：<u></u> help to identify the type of lung disease (obstructive vs restrictive)， as well as potential reversibility of airflow obstruction. Restrictive lung diseases tend to have lower lung volumes (decreased TLC and VC)， whereas obstructive diseases have larger lung volumes (TLC normal or increased) with decreased expiratory flow rates (reduced FEV < 80% expected， and FEV，/FVC< 0.7). Specific parameters help to classify the type and degree of lung dysfunction . Reduced FEV /FVC with minimal response to bronchodilators is the hallmark of COPD.Figure 15-1.

【13】intubation and mechanical ventilation in the treatment of cooperative patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD and severe hypercapnia. Signs of acute respi-ratory failure include tachypnea (respiratory rate > 40 breaths/min)， inability to speak because of dyspnea， accessory muscle use with fatigue despite maximal ther-apy， confusion， restlessness， agitation， lethargy， a rising Paco， level， and extreme hypoxemia. Acute respiratory failure is generally treated with endotracheal intu-bation and mechanical ventilatory support to correct the gas exchange disorders. Complications of mechanical ventilation include difficulty in extubation， ventilator-associated pneumonia， and pneumothorax.

【14】Other therapies such as inhaled bronchodilators (beta-agonists and/or anticho-linergics) or inhaled glucocorticoids are used for symptomatic relief and to reduce the frequency of exacerbations. Therapeutic recommendations are based on the disease stage， per the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease(GOLD) guidelines .

【16】Abbreviations： FEV。 forced expiratory volume in 1 second； FVC， forced vital capacity.Long-term complications of COPD from hypoxemia can cause pulmonary hyper-tension， secondary erythrocytosis， exercise limitation， and impaired mental func-tioning. For patients with COPD who are stable， only smoking cessation， supplemental oxygen therapy for patients with chronic hypoxemia， and lung volume reduction surgery in selected patients have been shown to alter the natural history of the disease and provide a reduction in mortality. Patients with resting hypoxemia(Pao， <55 mm Hg or arterial oxygen saturation \[Sao，arterial oxygen saturation\]<88%) generally benefit from home oxygen therapy， which must be utilized at least18 h/d.● See also Case 14 (Pulmonary Embolism)， Case 16 (Chronic Cough/Asthma)， Case 17 (Pleural Effusion， Parapneumonic)， and Case 19(Community-Acquired Pneumonia).王磊
