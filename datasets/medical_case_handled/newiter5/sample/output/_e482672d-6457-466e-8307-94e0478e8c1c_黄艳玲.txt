【0】Case 3.1 A 45-year-old patient referred for“persistent shingles”

【1】Erythematous macular rash， may desquamate； and

【2】Soft tissue necrosis (e.g. necrotizing fasciitis， myositis， or gangrene)

【3】The case fatality rate for GAS TSS is higher than that for staphylococcal TSS.

【4】The epidemiology andpathogenesis of GAS TSS have been summarized below通用删除6(英):<u>\[2，4\]</u>.

【5】· Severe invasive GAS infections are defined as bacteremia， pneumonia， necro-tizing fasciitis， gangrenous myositis， or any other infection associated with the isolation of GAS from a normally sterile body site.

【6】· GAS TSS is defined as any GAS infection associated with the acute onset of shock and organ failure.

【7】· GAS TSS is mediated by toxins that activate the immune system， resulting in the release of large quantities of inflammatory cytokines that cause capillary leak and tissue damage， leading to shock and multiorgan failure.

【8】Table 11.2a Clinical characteristics of toxic shock-like syndrome caused by group A streptococcus 通用删除6(英):<u>\[2，4\]</u>.

| Characteristic  | Comment  |
| --- | --- |
| Age group affected  | All ages； predominantly adults  |
| Sex most often affected  | No predilection  |
| Portal of entry  | Variable， generally skin or soft tissue (also vagina and respiratory tract)  |
| Clinical features  | Fever； hypotension； altered mental status， coma； signs of soft tissue  |
|  | infection that usually progresses to necrotizing fasciitis or myositis；  |
|  | active varicella with secondary infection； multiorgan dysfunction， often  |
|  | with acute respiratory distress syndrome  |
| Bacteremia  | Often present (about 60%)  |
| Causative organism  | Group A streptococcus  |
| M serotvpe  | Variable； 1， 3， 12， and 28 most common  |
| Type of pyrogenic exotoxin  | A. B， C， SSA， MF  |
| Case fatality rate  | 30-60%  |

【10】·The prevalence of GAS infections increased in the 1980s and has remained at approximately 3.5 cases per 100，000 people. Up to one-third of these cases develop GAS TSS.

【11】·Persons of all ages may be afflicted with GAS TSS and most are not immuno-suppressed.

【12】· Shock at the time of admission or within 4-8 hours is present in virtually all patients with GAS TSS.

【13】Stevens has emphasized the importance of clindamycin as a key component of TSS treatment， especially as penicillins are most active in the logarithmic phase of growth of the organism， and have no toxin-binding capability 通用删除6(英):<u>\[5\]</u>. Other advan-tages over penicillin include longer postantibiotic effect of clindamycin， as well as not being affected by inoculum size (a problem for penicillins).

【14】Recommendations for treatment of streptococcal TSS 通用删除6(英):<u>\[5\]</u>

【15】· Optimal management of a patient with GAS TSS includes management of the complications of sepsis， aggressive surgical debridement if a site of infection is identified， and antibiotics for the underlying infection.

【16】· Prompt and aggressive exploration and debridement of suspected deep-seated GAS infections.

【17】· For patients who present with the clinical manifestations of GAS TSS prior to the identification of GAS by culture： empiric therapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics which should include clindamycin.

【18】· Once the diagnosis of GAS TSS is established， recommend therapy with clin-damycin (900 mg IV every 8 hours) in addition to penicillin G (4 million units IV every 4 hours).

【19】· The duration of antibiotic therapy for GAS TSS should be individualized.

【20】·Stevens suggests therapy with intravenous immune globulin (1 g/kg day 1， followed by 0.5 g/kg on days 2 and 3) in patients with GAS TSS 通用删除6(英):<u>\[5\]</u>.

【21】Lessons learned from this case

【22】· Prompt intervention with surgery was essential in saving the life of this patient.

【23】· Even with his youth (only 18 years)， recovery from this illness back to his base-line would still take many months. At 3 months， his left ventricular ejection fraction was still only 40-45%.

【24】· He clearly had too many consultants because there was no clarity about a uni-fying diagnosis， at least initially.

【25】·He ended up with many more tests and procedures than were needed for opti-mal care of his illness (just because he was seen by so many consultants).

【26】· Again， a good and detailed history and physical exam are essential to an accu-rate， prompt， and complete diagnosis. Timing of intervention may be essential for a favorable outcome.

【27】· Azithromycin (a macrolide antibiotic) is not a reliable antimicrobial agent for streptococcal pharyngitis (it did not work in this patient)； the GAS was resistant to the agent.

【28】· Overall， the patient had appropriate antimicrobial therapy. He was just too ill to recover quickly.

【29】The infectious diseases consult， although able to provide a unifying diagnosis， was rather too late in the course to make a meaningful impact on the critical stage of his illness. In these sick patients， the earlier the consult is placed， the better.

【30】We are reminded here again that GAS TSS is a very serious disease， with mul-tiorgan dysfunction and a high mortality.黄艳玲
