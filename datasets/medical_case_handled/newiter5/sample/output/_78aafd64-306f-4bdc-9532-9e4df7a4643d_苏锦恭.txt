【0】Case 15
A 64-year-old man is brought into the emergency department (ED) by his family after fainting at home. He was standing， dusting a bookshelf， when he fell back-ward onto the couch. He was noted to be pale and clammy during the incident， and recovered spontaneously in approximately 30 seconds. He does remember the moments just prior to and after the incident. He felt lightheaded and had palpitations just prior to falling， but does not describe any shortness of breath， chest pain， headache， nausea， diplopia， or loss of bowel or bladder control. His history includes a myocardial infarction 2 years prior. The patient has been taking his regular medicines as directed， which include aspirin， a B-blocker， and a cho-lesterol-lowering agent. His primary medical doctor has not recently started any new medicines or changed his doses. On presentation to the ED， the patient’s vitals are blood pressure 143/93 mm Hg， heart rate of 75 beats per minute， respi-ratory rate of 18 breaths per minute， temperature of 37.1℃ (98.8°F)， and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. His examination is significant for a cardiac gal-lop. No carotid bruits， neurological abnormalities， rectal bleeding， or orthostatic changes are noted. A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrates a normal sinus rhythm at 75 beats per minute with no significant changes from a prior study6 months earlier； the ECG reveals Q waves in leads Il， IIl， and aVF. The patient now states he feels fine and would like to go home.

【4】Summary： This is a 64-year-old man with a medical history that includes a myocardial infarction who presents with an episode of syncope. The patient has an ECG with inferior Q waves， but no acute changes at the time of presentation.1\. Recognize worrisome historical and physical features of syncope.

【5】2\. Understand the emergency physician's (EP’s) role in evaluation of patients with syncope， and the role of selective diagnostic testing.

【6】3\. Learn to recognize which patients need to be admitted to the hospital.Syncope is an extremely common presenting symptom to the ED， accounting for approximately 5% of all ED visits in this country. Between 1% and 6% of hospital-ized patients are admitted for an evaluation of syncope. The list of potential eti-ologies of syncope is extensive； causes include cardiac， reflex-mediated， orthostatic(eg， postural hypotension caused by volume depletion， sepsis-related peripheral vasodilation， or medications)， psychiatric， hormonal， neurologic， and idiopathic. Unnecessary or inappropriate ancillary testing can consume thousands of dollars per patient and increase ED length of stay. With a carefully taken history and physical examination， clinicians can better risk stratify patients and determine who needs to be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and who can be safely discharged for outpatient workup.Orthostasis (ie， a drop in systolic blood pressure of 20 mm Hg or more result-ing from a rapid change in body position from a supine to more upright posture) is another common cause of syncope. Diaphoresis， lightheadedness， and graying of vision may suggest orthostatic syncope， and recurrence of these symptoms on stand-ing is more significant than the actual numeric change in blood pressure. However， orthostasis may be present in up to 40% of patients older than the age of 70 who are asymptomatic.Orthostatic hypotension can be related to volume depletion， sepsis-related peripheral vascular dilation， medications， and autonomic instability， which can develop in a number of chronic illnesses such as diabetes， Parkinson disease， multiple sclerosis， and other neuromuscular disorders. Volume depletion secondary to sudden blood loss needs to be considered in all patients with syncope. Patients of all ages can develop a sudden gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and the initial blood flow can be occult because it is confined to the lower GI tract. Elderly patients can lose massive amounts of blood from a leaking or ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm， with abdominal or flank pain as common associated complaints， but syncope alone can also be the presenting complaint. In the female patient of childbearing age， normal intrauterine or ruptured ectopic pregnancy may present with syncope. The former may cause orthostasis as a result of the normal cardiovascular changes asso-ciated with pregnancy， and the latter as the only manifestation of life-threatening hemorrhage.Much to the frustration of patients and providers， the underlying cause of the syn-copal presentation is not elucidated in approximately half of patients who present to the ED with syncope. Unfortunately， patients in this category represent a mixed population in which it is estimated that anywhere between 45% and 80% may have had a cardiac cause. Most of the young and otherwise healthy patients will be dis-charged home without a clearly defined cause for their loss of consciousness. Many of the elderly patients will be admitted for additional testing and observation. Of all the diagnostic tools available to physicians in the evaluation of syncope， a good thorough history， a physical examination， and ECG are the only level A recommen-dations from the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP). The infor-mation gathered from the history and physical examination alone will identify the potential cause of syncope in 45% of cases.While diagnosis and treatment are the goals in the evaluation of syncope， the decision tree for EM physicians is more focused than that of the specialist or outpa-tient physician 删除33：<u></u>. Unstable patients presenting after a syncopal episode， including those with persistent hypotension， life-threatening dysrhythmias， active blood loss， acute coronary syndromes， hemodynamically significant pulmonary emboli， and cardiac tamponade must be managed emergently. The“ABC”(airway， breathing， circulation) approach to the unstable patient applies in this scenario as in all presentations with unstable vital signs. History and physical examination inSeveral studies have tried to aid the EM physician in identifying high-risk patients by using clinical decision rules . The San Francisco Syncope Rule， the OESIL (Osservatorio Epidemiologico sulla Sincope nel Lazio)， and the ROSE (Risk Stratification of Syncope in the Emergency Department) are decision rules that attempt to provide clinicians with patient characteristics associated with an increased likelihood for an adverse outcome The San Francisco Syncope rule uses five criteria： history of CHF， abnormal ECG， hematocrit <30， shortness of breath， and/or systolic BP of <90 mm Hg at triage， to predict who requires hospitalization. The OESIL score is based upon abnormal ECG， history of cardiac disease， age >65， and syncope without prodrome. The ROSE predictors are： BNP >300， positive fecal

| Table 15-1· SYNCOPE RULES  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | Symptoms  | ECG  | Laboratory  | PMH  | Vital Signs  | Age  |
| SFSR  | SOB  | Abnormal ECG  | HCT<30  | CHF  | SBP<90  |  |
| OESIL  | No prodrome  | Abnormal ECG  |  | Cardiac disease  |  | \>65  |
| ROSE  |  | Abnormal ECG  | Hb<9 Fecal occult bloodBNP>300  |  | O， sat <94%  |  |occult blood， hemoglobin <9.0， oxygen saturation <94%， and Q waves present on ECG. The Rose rule is the first to incorporate a biochemical marker， BNP， into the criteria and claims a sensitivity and negative predictive value of 87.2% and 98.5%， respectively. An abnormal ECG is the only common thread in all three rule sets删除33：<u></u>， although “abnormal" may be defined in a variety of ways. If the bio-chemical marker BNP in the ROSE criteria is considered a surrogate for a history of CHF， this reinforces that known cardiac disease is a factor associated with high-risk patients. Regardless of which rule set one considers， it should be recognized that decision tools and algorithms should never be used as a substitute for a full evalua-tion and individualized clinical judgment of all aspects of the patient's presentation. Many of these decision rules are still undergoing evaluation in an effort to gain vali-dation. In fact， a recent analysis comparing the efficacy of risk stratification using the San Francisco and OESIL rule sets versus clinical judgment on short-term prognosis found that both rule sets had relatively low sensitivities. Having to use both rule sets would be needed to identify all patients who subsequently died， and the best results were obtained if a clinician used a combination of clinical knowledge with a rule set.Figure 15-2.
