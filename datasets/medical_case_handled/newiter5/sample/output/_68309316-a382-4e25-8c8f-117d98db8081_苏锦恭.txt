【4】### 10.1.4 Discussion

【5】The boy met all the criteria of Kawasaki disease, high fever more than 5 days combined with 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> bilateral conjunctivitis; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> red and cracked lips and strawberry tongue; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> rashes; 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> cervical lymphadenectasis; 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> swelling of extremities and followed by typical peeling skin; additional laboratory parameters: WBC ≥ 15 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, CRP ≥ 30 mg/L, NT pro-BNP extremely high.

【6】On Day 3 of illness, considering the typical symptoms, the boy was given infusion of IVIG 1 mg/kg/day, for 2 days, but his fever was not improved. After transferred to our ward, high dosage IVIG infusion was given twice (totally IVIG 6 g/kg), followed by oral methylprednisolone (5 mg/kg/day). Then his symptoms were gradually settled down.

【7】### 10.1.5 The Special Features of the Patient

【8】1.  1.
    The peak temperature in KD patients is usually >39 °C, even >40 °C. With timely and adequate medications (aspirin and IVIG), fever is usually improved within 36 h. Without appropriate medical treatment, the fever may last 3–4 weeks, 11 days on average. Approximately 10–20% of patients with KD are refractory to IVIG therapy, and these “non-responders” are at higher risk of developing coronary artery abnormalities. This is generally thought to be the result of failure to halt the inflammatory process and is commonly referred to as refractory or resistant KD. The differential activation of monocytes from T cells involves endothelial activation and systemic vascular inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 1 \]</u>. The effects of IVIG treatment could arise from FcγRIIB-mediated immune-regulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 2 \]</u> and regulatory T cell functions 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 3 \]</u>. The standard treatment protocol for IVIG-resistant KD has not yet been established. Corticosteroids are the second most commonly used medication used to treat KD patients who have recurrent or persistent fevers after IVIG treatment. Additional second-line drugs for IVIG-resistant KD including methylprednisolone (high-dose pulse methylprednisolone 20–30 mg/kg intravenously for 3 days 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 4 \]</u>), infliximab, cyclosporine, and methotrexate have been reported.
2.  2.
    The best timing to give IVIG infusion is Day 5–9 after fever onset. Application of IVIG earlier than that may be one of the reasons causing IVIG non-response, possibly that IVIG disturbs the varying balance and recovery of inflammatory factors/mediators at different stages of the disease course. Timing of IVIG administration is important, as a very early treatment of KD within 4 days presents an additional risk factor for IVIG non-responsiveness 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 5 \]</u>.
3.  3.
    A multicenter study indicates that IVIG non-responders are prone to develop CAA (18.6%), though initial sufficient IVIG therapy decreases the risk of IVIG nonresponse. Recent studies have focused on determining the predictive factors for initial IVIG-resistance 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 6 \]</u> and adjunctive anti-cytokine therapies to reduce the risk of cardiac sequelae 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 7 \]</u>. Clinical trials and meta-analyses demonstrated that treatment with addition of corticosteroids to IVIG is beneficial for the prevention of coronary artery aneurysms in severe cases with the highest risk of IVIG-resistance 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 8 \]</u>. Disease susceptibility genes could affect the incidence of KD as well as the response to IVIG 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 9 \]</u>. According to the critical assessment of risk scoring systems (Egami score, Kobayashi score, and Sano score) for Kawasaki syndrome, high CRP level is globally considered a risk factor for non-responsiveness to IVIG and the subsequent risk of CAA in all systems, probably as a result of stronger systemic inflammation driving endothelial abnormalities and final development of cardiovascular complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 10 \]</u>. In addition, most scores have considered thrombocytopenia and patient’s age less than 6–12 months as individual risk factors for the occurrence of CAA. Damage to coronary arteries is still a substantial risk for a non-negligible percentage of children with KD, mostly in the cases showing resistance to IVIG 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 9 \]</u>: the identification of this cohort of children at the time of first clinical assessment may help in discerning those who would benefit from a combined primary treatment with IVIG and corticosteroids.
4.  4.
    At the acute stage of KD, 50% patients present WBC >15 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L. As a result of increase of premature and mature neutrophil, leukopenia was rare. The convalescent stage was characterized by thrombocytosis (even more than 1000 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L), which gradually peaked on the third week after illness, then dropped to normal during the fourth week. Thrombocytopenia at the acute stage should be concerned for it may be a sign of DIC, also a risk factor of aneurysm.
5.  5.
    ESR and CRP are parameters to assess acute stage of KD. They were dropped to normal 6–10 weeks after onset of illness. For IVIG infusion can increase ESR, ESR alone can’t be used to assess activation of inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 5 \]</u>. In this case, after the first and second IVIG infusions, WBC and CRP were elevated persistently, indicating a persistent activation of immune-reaction. The slowly decreased tendency of WBC may partially attribute to methylprednisolone.
6.  6.
    Hypoalbuminemia is common in severe or refractory KD patients, as the result of capillary and vessel leakage and frequent blood drawn. Albumin is vital in the course of vascular repair. In our ward, albumin dosage was 1 g/kg/day, for 2 days once ALB<30 mg/L.
