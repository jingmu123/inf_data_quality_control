【3】SALIENT FEATURES

【4】Examination

【5】●around the mouth and the base of the nose contract.

【6】●Palmomental reflex： occurs when a disagreeable stimulus is drawn from the thenar eminence at the wrist to the base of the thumb 删除10：<u>(Arch 删除换行3 Neurol 1988；45：425-7)</u>； there is ipsilateral contraction of the orbicula-ris oris and mentalis muscles， the corner of the mouth elevates slightly and the skin over the chin wrinkles.

【7】Sucking reflex： elicited by tapping or lightly touching the lips with a tongue blade or the examiner's finger； sucking movements of the lips occur when they are stroked or touched.

【8】Note： The above three reflexes are normal in infants， may be present in normal individuals and are said to be present in a larger number of patients with neurological disease. They are most often seen in those with diffuse cerebral conditions that affect the frontal lobes and pyramidal tracts. The occurrence of more than one reflex is more suggestive of disease han normality.

【9】Grasp reflex： obtained when the examiner's hand is gently inserted into the palm of the patient's hand (when the patient is distracted， usually by engaging him in conversation). With a positive response， the patient grasps the examiner’s hand and continues to grasp it as it is moved. The presence of the grasp reflex indicates disease of the supplementary motor area of the frontal cortex.

【10】Jaw jerk .

【11】DIAGNOSIS

【12】This patient has expressive dysphasia (lesion) caused by a stroke (aetiol-ogy) and is unable to express himself (functional status).

【13】QUESTIONS

【14】What do you understand by the term dysphasia?

【15】Dysphasia is a disorder of the content of speech， which usually follows a lesion of the dominant cortex. The type of dysphasia indicates the site of the lesion in the cortex：

【16】● Expressive， nominal or motor dysphasia： site is the posterior inferior part of the dominant frontal lobe of the cortex (i.e. Broca's area)

【17】Sensory or receptive dysphasia： site is the superior temporal lobe or Wernicke's area.

【18】Note： Sites associated with speech function are variably located along the cortex and can go well beyond the classic anatomical boundaries of Broca's area. These sites typically involve an area contiguous with the face-motor cortex； however， they can be located several centimeters from the sylvian fissure 删除10：<u>(N Engl J Med 2008；358：18)</u>.

【19】What do you understand by the term dysarthria?

【20】Dysarthria is an inability to articulate properly caused by local lesions in the mouth or disorders of speech muscles or their connections. There is no disorder of the content of speech. The causes of dysarthria are：

【21】stutter 删除换行1 paralysis of cranial nerves： Bell’s palsy， ninth， tenth and eleventh nerves 删除换行1 cerebellar disease： staccato， scanning speech

【22】Parkinson's speech： slow， quiet， slurred， monotonous 删除换行1 pseudobulbar palsy： monotonous， high-pitched 'hot potato'speech 删除换行1 progressive bulbar palsy： nasal.

【23】ADVANCED-LEVEL QUESTIONS

【24】What are the components of speech?

【25】●1Phonation： abnormality is called dysphonia

【26】●Articulation： abnormality is called dysarthria

【27】●1Language： abnormality is called dysphasia.

【28】What are the other dominant hemisphere functions?

【29】·Right-left orientation

【30】●Finger identification

【31】● Calculation.

【32】function to allow examination of the object. The lesion is in the parietal lobe.

【33】Prosopagnosia： the inability to recognize a familiar face. The lesion is in the parieto-occipital lobe.

【34】●Visual agnosia： the inability to recognize objects despite the fact that the main visual pathways to the occipital cortex are preserved. The lesion is in the parieto-occipital lobe.

【35】Anosognosia： the lack of awareness or realization that the limbs are paralysed， weak or have impaired sensation. The lesion is usually in the non-dominant parietal lobe.

【36】What do you understand by the term apraxia?

【37】Apraxia is the inability to perform purposeful volitional movements in the absence of motor weakness， sensory deficits or severe incoordination.

【38】Usually the defect is in the dominant parietal lobe， with disruption of con-nections to the motor cortex and to the opposite hemisphere.

【39】What are the different types of apraxia?

【40】● Dressing apraxias： patient is unable to put on his clothes correctly.

【41】● Gait apraxia： difficulty in walking， although patients may show intact leg movements when examined in bed.

【42】● Ideomotor apraxia： patients are unable to perform movements on command， although they may do this automatically， e.g. lick their Llps.

【43】●Ideational apraxias： difficulty in carrying out a complex series of move-ments， e.g. to take a match from a box to light a cigarette.

【44】● Constructional apraxia： patient has difficulty in arranging patterns on blocks or copying designs.

【45】What do you know about dyslexia?

【46】Reading difficulties， including dyslexia， occur as a part of a continuum that also includes normal reading ability. It is not an all-or-none phen-omenon but， like hypertension， occurs in degrees. It has been defined as a disorder that is manifested by difficulty in learning to read despite conventional instruction， adequate intelligence and sociocultural opportunity.
