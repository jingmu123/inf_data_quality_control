【0】50.1. Compared with kidney donors， which of the following is most accurate for kidney transplant recipients ?

【1】A. Do not require preoperative dialysis

【2】B. Have more comorbid medical conditions

【3】C. Have normal renal function

【4】D. Require less intraoperative monitoring

【5】50.2. Which of the following is most accurate regarding patients undergoing dialysis?

【6】A. Patients undergoing dialysis typically have stable circulating blood volumes due to the dialysis.

【7】B.Patients undergoing dialysis need to have their serum potassium measured just prior to the procedure.

【8】C. Because of the dialysis， their intravenous access is usually easy.

【9】D. Patients undergoing dialysis must be sufficiently stable to be trans-ported to a dialysis unit.

【10】ANSWERS

【11】50.1. B. Kidney transplant recipients typically have more comorbid med-ical conditions such as diabetes or hypertension. Their renal func-tion is impaired and they require more intraoperative monitoring. Renal failure patients undergo dialysis， whereas donors do not.

【12】50.2. B. Dialysis in the patient with renal failure is associated with signifi-cant fluxes in serum potassium concentrations. If the patient is near his or her routinely scheduled dialysis time， the serum potassium can exceed 6.0 and even 7.0 g/dL. Similar fluctuations also occur in blood volume， even from relative hypovolemia to hypervolemia. However， in patients immediately postdialysis， hypovolemia should be antici-pated. Patients on dialysis often have an arteriovenous fistula(s) in their upper extremity. Because only one arm can be used for blood sampling， their intravenous access is usually difficult. Being sufficiently stable to be transported to a dialysis unit is not a prerequisite for dial-ysis. Peritoneal dialysis is easily conducted in the ICU setting.

【13】Clinical Pearls

【14】\>Donors require no special monitoring. Key points include anxiolysis， adequate hydration，and analgesia.

【15】Recipients typically have numerous comorbidities and may benefit from invasive monitoring.

【16】Recipients are immunosuppressed and may require diuretics and/or mannitol to facilitate urine production.

【17】While both surgeries are typically performed under general endotracheal anesthesia， the level of anesthetic complexity is very different between the two.黄艳玲
