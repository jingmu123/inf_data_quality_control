【0】CASE 28

【1】A 38-year-old G3P3 divorced executive presents to your clinic for contraceptive advice. She has been in a monogamous relationship with her boyfriend for sev-eral months. She denies any drug allergies. She occasionally drinks alcohol and smokes half a pack of cigarettes a day. She mentions that she used to take birth control pills without any problems. All three of her children were born via vaginal delivery without complication. She and her partner are free of sexually transmit-ted diseases (STDs) based on their recent checkups. She reports that she is tired of using over-the-counter contraceptives because they are inconvenient. She said that her life is very busy because of work. She fears any form of surgery and has not excluded having another child. Her laboratory workup is normal. Her physical examination is normal. She is looking for the “best contraceptive method"for her situation.

【2】What contraceptive options are available to this woman?

【3】Which contraceptives are contraindicated for her?

【4】Combination pills are the most commonly used contraceptive method. The combination pill suppresses ovulation through inhibition of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis， alters the cervical mucus， retards sperm entry， and discour-ages ovum implantation by creating an unfavorable endometrium. Combination oral contraceptives offer significant protection against ovarian cancer， endometrial cancer， iron-deficiency anemia from menstrual blood loss， pelvic inflammatory dis-ease (PID)， and fibrocystic breast disease. Women who take combination pills have a lower risk of functional ovarian cy CUS sts. The POP reduces cervical mucus and causes it to thicken. The mucus thickening prevents the sperm from reaching the egg and keeps the uterine lining from thickening， which prevents the fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus. The POP is ideal for breast-feeding mothers because it does not interfere with milk production as combination OCPs do. When taken as directed， the failure rate for the POP is 1% to 3%； the failure rate of the combina-tion pill is 1% to 2%. Typical use of OCPs has a failure rate of 8% to 10%.

【5】Women over the age of 35 who smoke cigarettes and women with certain medi-cal conditions should not take the combined OCP. Table 28-2 lists the absolute

| CONTRACEPTION  |  |
| Absolute Contraindications  | Relative Contraindications  |
| Previous thromboembolic event  | Severe vascular headache (classic migraine，cluster)  |
| Cerebral vascular disease  | Severe hypertension (if younger than 35-40 years and ingood medical control， can elect OCP)  |
| Coronary occlusion  | Diabetes mellitus (prevention of pregnancy outweighs therisk of complicating vascular disease in a diabetic who isyounger than 35-40 years)  |
| Impaired liver function  | Gallbladder disease (may exacerbate emergence of symp-toms when gallstones are present)  |
| Known or suspected breast cancer  | Obstructive jaundice in pregnancy  |
| Smokers (>15 cigarettes/day)olderthan 35 years  | Epilepsy (antiepileptic drugs may decrease effectiveness ofOCPs)  |
| Congenital hyperlipidemia  | Morbid obesity  |When starting an O CP， ideally a patient should take the first pill on the first day of the start of menses. Women may also choose to start on the Sunday after the start of their menses for convenience. A quick-start method has also been pro-posed， in which patients start taking the pills as soon as they obtain the prescrip-tion (if pregnancy is unlikely)， which improves compliance. Both Sunday-start and quick-start methods require an additional backup method to be used for the first week. Postpartum， non-breast-feeding women should start the OCP during the fourth week after delivery. Breast-feeding women should start the minipill dur-ing the sixth week after delivery. OCPs can be started the day after an induced or spontaneous abortion. If a pill is missed， it should be taken as soon as possible and the next dose should be taken as usual. If two or more pills are missed， the patient should be directed to the package insert for instructions and additional backup contraception should be used for at least 7 days following resumption.A transdermal contraceptive patch (Ortho Evra and others) is a combined hormone patch containing norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol. The treatment regimen for each cycle is three consecutive 7-day patches followed by one patch-free week， so that withdrawal bleeding can occur. It can be started in a similar fashion to com-bined OCPs： on the first day of the menstrual cycle， the first Sunday after the men-strual cycle， or the day the prescription is filled. If the Sunday-start or quick-start methods are used， a backup method of contraception is needed for 7 days. The patch may be placed on the buttocks， lower abdomen， upper outer arm， and upper torso， 删除换行1 except for the breasts. If a patch becomes detached， it should be replaced as soon as possible. If the patch is detached for more than 24 hours， it should be replaced and a backup method of contraception used for the next 7 days. The patchs efficacy and side effects are comparable to that of combined OCPs， although there may be an increased risk of vascular thrombosis with use of the patch. Women who weigh more than 90 kg may be at increased risk of pregnancy with patch use.NuvaRing is a flexible， transparent ring about 5 cm in diameter that delivers etono-gestrel and ethinyl estradiol. A woman inserts the NuvaRing herself， wears it for 3 weeks， then removes and discards the device. After one ring-free week， during which withdrawal bleeding occurs， a new ring is inserted. It does not need to be fit-ted by a health professional， and does not need to be removed during intercourse. If a patient or her partner experience problems with the ring during intercourse， it may be removed， but should be replaced within 3 hours. If it is out for more than3 hours， ovulation may occur. The manufacturer recommends using backup birth control for the first 7 days after placement if not switching from another hormonal contraceptive.Rarely， NuvaRing can slip out of the vagina， and it is recommended to check the position of the ring before and after intercourse.NuvaRing may not be appropriate for women with conditions that increase likelihood of ring expulsion， such as vaginal stenosis， cervical prolapse， cystocele， or rectocele. The efficacy and most side effects of NuvaRing are similar to those of combined OCPs， although vaginitis， discomfort， and foreign body sensation are also commonly reported.Medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo-Provera， Depo-subQ Provera 104) is an injectable form of a progestin. Medroxyprogesterone acetate has a failure rate of only 0.3% with perfect use， or 3% with typical use. Each injection provides contra-ceptive protection for 13 weeks， but can last for up to 4 months. It is injected every3 months (90 days) into the gluteus or deltoid muscle. The first dose should be given within 5 days of the onset of menses， so that no backup contraception is needed. Its side effects include irregular menses， weight gain， and injection site reactions. Irregular bleeding and spotting is more significant during the first few months and then is followed by periods of amenorrhea. About half of women develop amenor-rhea after a year of medroxyprogesterone acetate use. There may be a prolonged period of time prior to return of fertility after discontinuing Depo-Provera， up to18 months in a small proportion of women.Contraceptive implants， Implanon and Nexplanon， are inserted subdermally in an in-office minor surgical procedure， and may be removed with another minor proce-dure. Placement should be timed during the menstrual cycle or during the hormone-free week ifusing a combined hormonal contraceptive method.The implant contains etonogestrel， the active metabolite of desogestrel， and is effective for 3 years. At the end of 3 years， when the device is removed， a new device may be placed in the same site. The failure rate is less than 1% for women who weigh less than 70 kg.IUDs are small， plastic， flexible devices that are inserted into the uterus through the cervix by a trained physician. Three IUDs are presently marketed in the United States： ParaGard T380A， which is a T-shaped plastic device partially covered by copper that is effective for 10 years， Mirena， which is also a T-shaped plastic device， but contains levonorgestrel (a progestin) released over a 5-year period， and Skyla， which is essentially a smaller version of Mirena that releases slightly less levonorg-estrel and lasts for 3 years. All are very effective； the copper-T IUD has a 0.6%to0.8% failure rate， the Mirena has a failure rate of 0.2%， and Sklya has a failure rate of 0.9%. An IUD alters the uterine and tubal fluids， particularly in the case of cop-per-bearing IUDs， inhibiting the transport of sperm through the cervical mucus and uterus. Progesterone-containing IUDs also thin the uterine lining. Timing of placement should occur during the menstrual cycle and more specifically during the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle for levonorgestrel-containing IUDs.

【7】Manufacturer contraindications for IUD include current or suspected preg-nancy； current or recent acute PID or mucopurulent cervicitis； postpartum endo-metritis or infected abortion in the past 3 months； anatomically distorted uterine cavity， known or suspected uterine or cervical malignancy； unexplained uterine bleeding； and IUD already in place. Copper IUD is also contraindicated in Wilson disease. Levonorgestrel IUDs are also contraindicated in acute liver disease or liver tumor (benign or malignant)； breast cancer； and prior ectopic pregnancy. A history of STDs is not a contraindication to IUD placement， but if a woman has a known STD， it is recommended to delay insertion for 3 months following resolution of the infection. Levonorgestrel IUDs may actually reduce the risk of PID by thick-ening cervical mucus and thinning the endometrium， but caution should be used in patients who are at high risk for PID， and women with multiple sex partners should be counseled to use condoms in conjunction with IUD to reduce risk of contracting an infection.

【8】Side effects include irregular bleeding patterns during the first few months of use， headache， nausea， hair loss， acne， depression， decreased libido， ovarian cysts， and mastalgia. Many patients will become amenorrheic or oligomenorrheic with a levonorgestrel IUD in place， so it can be used to treat patients with menorrhagia. The copper IUD may actually cause heavy， irregular bleeding. Women may also experience some short-term side effects such as cramping and dizziness at the time of insertion； bleeding， cramps， and backache may continue for a few days after the insertion. Complications include expulsion， perforation of the uterus， and ectopic pregnancy. Approximately， 5% of women expel their IUD within the first year.The patient should check that the strings are palpable once a month， and if she cannot find the strings， she should see a health-care provider. The absolute rate of ectopic pregnancy is reduced with the IUD because of its high contraceptive efficacy. How-ever， when accidental pregnancy does occur， there is increased likelihood ofectopic pregnancy. Adolescence and nulliparity are not contraindications.Tubal ligation seals a womans fallopian tubes so that an egg cannot travel to the uterus. Hysteroscopic tubal obstruction through the placement of steriliza-tion devices in the fallopian tubes is also available. Two types are Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved： the micro-insert device (Essure) and the polymer matrix system (Adiana). Vasectomy involves closing off a man’s vas deferens so that sperm will not be carried to the penis. Vasectomy is a minor surgical procedure， most often performed in a doctors office under local anesthesia. Hysteroscopic tubal obstruction may be performed with local anesthesia or oral analgesics alone. Tubal ligation is an operating room procedure performed under general anesthesia. Major complications， which are rare in female sterilization， include infection， hem-orrhage， and problems associated with the use of general anesthesia. The failure rate is less than 1%. Although there has been some success in reopening the fal-lopian tubes and the vas deferens， the success rate is low， and sterilization should be considered irreversible.All female patients of reproductive age should be made aware of postcoital contra-ception some of which are available over the counter for adolescent girls of 17 years and older. This knowledge does not increase the likelihood of high-risk behavior. The Yuzpe method consists of taking high-dose combined OCPs for emergency con-traception， and can decrease the risk of pregnancy by about 75%. This method can be used up to 5 days after unprotected intercourse but is most effective when used within 72 hours. Consider prescribing an antiemetic to be used 1 hour before each dose， as nausea and vomiting are common side effects. Progestin-only emergency contraception is available without a prescription. One or two oral doses of levo-norgestrel (Plan B) 0.75 mg， with 12 hours between doses， is more effective than the Yuzpe method， better-tolerated， and can be used up to 5 days after unprotected intercourse. Preven， a convenient emergency contraception kit， includes two doses of medication and a pregnancy test. A single dose of mifepristone(RU-486)，apro-gesterone antagonist， is the most effective emergency contraceptive and has few side effects. A selective progesterone-receptor modulator， known as ulipristal ace-tate (Ella)， is taken in a single dose up to 5 days after unprotected intercourse， and does require a prescription. Placing a copper-containing IUD within 5 days after unprotected sex is the most effective form of emergency contraception， and also provides another 10 years of birth control， but should be avoided in those at risk for STDs， ectopic pregnancy， or if long-term contraception is not desired.王磊
