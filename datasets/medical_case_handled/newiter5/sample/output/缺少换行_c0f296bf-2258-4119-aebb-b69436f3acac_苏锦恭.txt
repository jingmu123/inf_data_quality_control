【0】40.1 A 55-year-old accountant complains of facial and tongue swelling. He recently started using a new bath soap. His medical problems include osteoarthritis and hypertension， for which he takes acetaminophen and lisinopril， respec-tively. Which of the following is the most likely etiology?

【1】1A. LisinoprilB3.SSoap hypersensitivity

【2】C. Hypothyroidism

【3】D. Acetaminophen

【4】E.FFood-related allergy

【5】40.2 An 18-year-old man with epilepsy controlled with medication develops fever， lymphadenopathy， a generalized maculopapular rash， elevated transaminases， and arthralgias. He reports having been bitten by ticks while working in the yard outside. Which of the following is the most likely etiology?

【14】40.4 A 57-year-old woman with congestive heart failure has a positive cardiac stress test. Cardiac catheterization is required to evaluate for coronary bypass grafting. She states that she has an allergy to iodine. Which of the following is the best next step?

【15】1A. Desensitization with increasing doses of oral iodineB

【16】Infusion of diphenhydramine during the procedure

【17】C. Cancel the procedure and proceed to surgery

【18】D. Diphenhydramine and corticosteroids the night before the procedure

【19】40.1 A. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are often associated with angioedema. Angioedema secondary to ACE inhibitors can occur at any subsequent point during use， not solely after the initial doses. Reactions to exogenous agents such as soap (answer B) typically result from a type IV HSR and usually present as a skin rash. Causes of anaphylactic reactions include drugs (answer D) and food (answer E). A true anaphylactic reaction is life threatening； it may present with angioedema with or without urticaria， but it also presents with other life threatening processes， such as hypotension. Drug allergies may present as an anaphylactic reaction or a drug rash； most drug rashes are maculopapular and occur several days after starting treatment with an offending drug and resolve with discontinuation of the drug. Hypo-thyroidism (answer C) is an autoimmune disease process most commonly caused by autoantibodies against thyroid peroxidase， thyroglobulin， and/or TSH receptors.

【20】40.2 B. This is a common presentation of hypersensitivity syndrome associated with aromatic anticonvulsants (phenytoin， carbamazepine， phenobarbital). Poison ivy (answer A) is not associated with fever and lymphadenopathy. Lyme disease (answer D) is associated with erythema migrans， an erythema-tous annular rash with a central clearing (target lesion) developing within days of infection. HIV (answer C) is a less likely answer considering that a history of risk factors is not being presented.

【21】40.3 D. This patient has developed airway obstruction due to an anaphylactic reaction. He requires intubation and mechanical ventilation to maintain oxygenation. The first step in treating anaphylaxis is assessing the ABCs. Intubation， if required， should not be delayed. Second， epinephrine (answer B) should be administered to help control symptoms and blood pressure. Additional treatment measures include placing the patient in a recumbent position， elevating the legs， administration of oxygen as needed (answer C)， NS volume replacement and/or use of vasopressors as required， and adminis-tration of diphenhydramine 50 mg orally or intravenously every 4 hours as needed (answer A). Electrical cardioversion (answer E) is not indicated in the treatment of anaphylaxis.

【22】40.4 D. Pretreatment with diphenhydramine， H， blockers， and corticosteroids beginning 12 hours before the procedure greatly decreases the reaction to contrast dye. For patients presenting with clinical indication for rapid imag-ing， premedication should be given at least 5 hours prior to contrast admin-istration (answer B). Therefore， there is no need to cancel the procedure and proceed with surgery (answer C). Desensitization (answer A) is not an appropriate treatment course since radiocontrast allergy is not a true allergic reaction.

【23】CLINICAL PEARLS

【24】Anaphylaxis is characterized by respiratory distress caused by broncho-spasm， cutaneous manifestations such as urticaria or angioedema， and gastrointestinal hypermotility. Patients may die as a consequence of air-way compromise or vascular collapse caused by widespread vasodilation.

【25】Treatment of anaphylaxis is immediate epinephrine， antihistamines， air-way protection， and blood pressure support as necessary. Corticosteroids may help prevent late recurrence of symptoms.

【26】Epinephrine is the immediate drug of choice in treating anaphylaxis.

【27】Serum sickness is an immune complex-mediated disease that may include fever， cutaneous eruptions， lymphadenopathy，arthritis， and glo-merulonephritis. It usually is self-limited， but treatment may be necessary for renal complications.

【28】Erythema multiforme minor is characterized by urticarial or bullous eruptions， often with target lesions， usually following HSV infections. Ery-thema multiforme major (SJS) usually is caused by drugs and includes cutaneous and mucosal involvement.
