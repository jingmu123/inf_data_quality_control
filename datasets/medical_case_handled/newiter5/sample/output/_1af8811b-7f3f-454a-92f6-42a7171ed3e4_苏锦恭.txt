【1】### CASE 46

【2】A 13-year-old right-hand dominant girl has increasingly frequent headaches over the past year. She has “always” had headaches, but they became more bothersome approximately 3 years ago in association with onset of menses, and decreased sleep. Her typical headache begins with a sense of slowed thinking and malaise followed soon after by a throbbing pain over the left side of her head, the right side of her head or, at times, over her forehead. The pain increases to its maximum severity of 8 to 9 out of 10 over the course of approximately 1 hour and will last for “many hours” if untreated. The patient reports that even light touch over the affected part of her head causes pain, and she is sensitive to bright lights and loud sounds. She typically feels nauseous and will occasionally have emesis. Acetaminophen and ibuprofen seem to help, but the best pain relief comes with sleeping in a dark room. After the pain resolves, she feels cognitively slow and “out of sorts” for up to a full day. Over the past year, however, the incidence of such attacks has increased to once every 2 to 3 weeks leading to frequent missed days in school and a drop in school performance. They seem to be associated with menses or poor sleep. Her physical examination and neurologic examination are completely normal. She consistently has had motion sickness “for as long as she can remember.” Neurodevelopmentally she met all milestones. The patient’s mother had “bad headaches” as a teenager and young adult and she has a maternal aunt, who was diagnosed with migraines at approximately 20 years of age. No other neurologic diseases are noted in the family.

【6】### ANSWERS TO CASE 46: Pediatric Headache (Migraine Without Aura)

【7】Summary : This 13-year-old right-handed healthy girl presents with a history of recurrent hemicranial headaches that are throbbing with moderate to moderately severe pain in a crescendo–decrescendo pattern associated with nausea and occasional emesis. She also reports photophobia and phonophobia. The headaches will last for many hours untreated, are improved somewhat with low doses of acetaminophen, and resolved if the patient can get to sleep. There is a brief prodrome of malaise and a more prolonged postdrome of cognitive dulling. The only noted triggers are sleep deprivation, and she has noted an association with her menstrual cycle. Her neurologic examination is completely normal, and her family history is significant for two people with probable migraines.

【8】• Most likely diagnosis: Migraine without aura ( common migraine ).

【9】• Next diagnostic step: No diagnostic workup necessary at this point.

【10】• Next step in therapy: Trial of appropriately dosed nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) followed by a trial of triptans if necessary. Consider prophylactic therapy given headache frequency.

【11】#### ANALYSIS

【12】##### Objectives

【13】1\. Understand the difference between primary and secondary headaches.

【14】2\. Know the clinical criteria for pediatric migraine headaches.

【15】3\. Understand the role of neuroimaging in evaluating headaches.

【16】4\. Know the different options available for acute abortive therapy for pediatric migraines.

【17】5\. Recognize when daily prophylactic therapy is warranted in migraine treatment and what possible options exist.

【18】##### Considerations

【19】This otherwise healthy and neurodevelopmentally normal 13-year-old girl is brought in for evaluation of frequent headaches. Because she is currently headache-free with a normal neurologic examination, attention can be turned to classifying her headache disorder, which will aid in dictating any necessary workup and intervention. A primary headache is one in which the head pain itself is the principal clinical entity, and there is no other underlying causative disorder. Tension-type headaches and migraine headaches would be common examples of such conditions. Secondary headaches, conversely, are headaches caused by another underlying disorder such as intracranial hemorrhage, central nervous system infection, temporomandibular joint pain, or substance abuse. In general, secondary headaches are defined by the underlying principal problem and require a more extensive and prompt evaluation. Primary headaches, however, are generally defined by their clinical symptoms and can require no workup if clinical criteria are met. The history in this scenario is classic for migraine with the unilateral aspect, throbbing, aura, family history, and triggers.

【20】### APPROACH TO: Pediatric Headache

【21】Head pain in children and adults can be divided into primary and secondary headaches. It can also be useful to consider the pattern of the patient’s headaches: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> acute recurrent —episodic head pain with pain-free intervals in between; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> chronic progressive —gradually worsening head pain with no pain-free intervals; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> chronic daily headache—a persistent headache that neither worsens nor remits; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> a mixed headache —a chronic daily headache with episodic exacerbations. Chronic progressive headaches raise the possibility of increasing intracranial pressure and require further evaluation with neuroimaging. Chronic daily headaches can be a secondary headache caused by cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, or can arise from a primary headache disorder. This condition as well as mixed headaches can require referral to a headache specialist.

【22】In 2004, the International Headache Society defined the criteria for pediatric migraine:

【23】A. Headache attack lasting 1 to 72 hours

【24】B. Headache has at least two of the following four features:

【25】通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Either bilateral or unilateral (frontal/temporal) location

【26】通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> Pulsating quality

【27】通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> Moderate-to-severe intensity

【28】通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> Aggravated by routine physical activities

【29】C. At least one of the following accompanies headache:

【30】通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Nausea and/or vomiting 删除换行1 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> Photophobia and phonophobia (can be inferred from their behavior)

【31】D. Five or more attacks fulfilling the above criteria

【32】The mean age of onset for pediatric migraine is approximately 7 years of age for boys and 11 years of age for girls. With regard to prevalence, 8% to 23% of children meet criteria for migraines in the second decade of life making such primary headaches a very common problem. Although migraines can be seen in children as young as 3 years of age, the prevalence is less than 3%. This is likely an underestimate, however, given the difficulty of making the diagnosis in very young children. Migraines commonly “run in families” and have a significant genetic component although only relatively rare migraine syndromes have been directly linked to a single gene mutation. Many cases of familial hemiplegic migraine, for example, have been linked to a mutation in the CACNA1A gene that encodes a voltage-gated P/Q-type calcium channel. One interesting association with migraine is that many patients report having motion sickness (ie, “car sickness”) as children. Although this clinical finding is useful if present, its absence in no way diminishes the possibility of migraine.

【33】As in adults, migraines in children often begin with a prodromal premonitory phase with neurologic or constitutional symptoms lasting for hours or days before the headache. These “warning signs” can slowly increase over time or remain constant. Some patients develop an aura prior to the onset of pain that consists of a stereotyped focal symptom usually preceding the headache by no more than an hour. Visual auras are the most common type and can involve a variety of visual aberrations such as scotomata, flashes, or geometric forms. Motor, sensory, and cognitive auras can also be seen. The pattern of the pain is typically crescendo in onset and decrescendo in offset and is certainly not maximal from the beginning. As the pain continues, the patient often develops cutaneous allodynia, which means that normally non-noxious stimulation is perceived as painful during the headache. Associated elements such as nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, vertigo, and nasal congestion are common. Following the headache, most patients experience a post-dromal phase with symptoms such as difficulty concentrating, particular food cravings, and fatigue. Triggers commonly associated with migraine headaches include strong smells, particularly if noxious, exercise, sleep deprivation, missing meals, and mild head trauma. Many patients associate certain foods with the onset of their migraines, but this can at times be difficult to distinguish between food cravings occurring during the prodromal phase. Women with migraines are more likely to experience headaches around the time of menses.

【34】#### EVALUATION

【35】A careful history and physical examination are the most important aspects of the evaluation. When the history is unequivocally consistent with migraine and the neurologic examination is completely normal, no further workup is needed. In particular, neuroimaging is unnecessary, and the yield is low. However, an abnormal neurologic examination, or worrisome feature on history necessitates an MRI scan. Although most parents fear the presence of a brain tumor, more than 98% of patients with intracranial masses have abnormalities on their neurologic examination. It is important that the neurologic examination include an assessment of head circumference, visualization of the optic discs, assessment of nuchal rigidity, and palpation of the sinuses in order to carefully screen for underlying causes. Electroencephalography (EEG) is not routinely indicated in the evaluation of headaches. Patients with epilepsy often have postictal headaches, but it would be quite unusual for the headache to be the primary presenting complaint. Lumbar puncture (LP) is essential if head pain is thought to be caused by a CNS infection and is part of the evaluation of subarachnoid hemorrhage (if a CT scan is unrevealing). LP however has no routine role in the evaluation of primary headache disorders.

【36】#### TREATMENT AND MANAGEMENT

【37】Treatment of migraine focuses on two concepts: acute pain relief (abortive therapy) and headache prevention (prophylactic therapy) . There are an ever-increasing number of available medications that can be used for abortive therapy with few controlled trials to help guide decision making. Perhaps the best studied medications are ibuprofen and acetaminophen and both have been shown to be safe and effective in children. Many patients will already have tried such medications prior to coming to see their doctor, but they often have been underdosed or given late in the progression of the headache, which renders them as much less effective. In such patients, it is worth a trial of adequately dosed ibuprofen (10 mg/kg) or acetaminophen (15 mg/kg) given as soon as possible after the onset of the pain. If these medications prove ineffective, then a trial of 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor agonists (the triptans ) is indicated. These agents are available in a variety of formulations and also differ from one another in terms of half-life. At present, the best pediatric data supports the use of sumatriptan nasal spray as an abortive agent in children . Oral formulations and subcutaneous injections have not been subjected to adequate trials in children at this point.

【38】For patients with frequent migraines (eg, two or more a month) or particularly long-lasting or disabling migraines, daily prophylactic medications can be considered with the treatment goal being to decrease headache frequency. Compliance with a daily medication is a requirement. Sometimes, avoidance of triggers can significantly diminish headache frequency obviating the need for prophylactic medications. Simple lifestyle modification, such as keeping to a regular schedule of eating and sleeping and avoiding triggers, can significantly decrease the headache burden. Should medication be necessary, several classes of pharmacologic agents are used as prophylactic treatments: beta-blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, antihista-mines, calcium channel blockers, and anticonvulsants. As is the case with abortive therapies, much better data exists for the use of prophylactic medications in adults. Cyproheptadine has long been used in younger children for this purpose, but supportive data is based on retrospective nonblinded trials. Similarly, amitriptyline is somewhat sedating although generally well tolerated, but its efficacy has only been shown in retrospective studies. The use of anticonvulsants, particularly topiramate, for migraine prophylaxis is increasing in both adult and pediatric patients. Although good quality studies have supported its use in adults, there have yet to be adequate clinical trials in children.
