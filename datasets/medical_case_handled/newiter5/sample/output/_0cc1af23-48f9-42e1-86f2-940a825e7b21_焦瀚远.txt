增加换行1: History of Present Illness
--------------------------

【4】The boy was outside playing with his friends this afternoon when he was stung by a bee. The patient’s mother reports that he was crying, screaming, and tearful when she noticed that his lips were swollen. The patient began to have difficulty breathing, so she called emergency medical services (EMS). On arrival to the scene, the patient had marked facial and lip edema and was in significant respiratory distress, so EMS administered intramuscular epinephrine to the patient and transported him to the ED.Past Medical and Surgical History
---------------------------------

【5】The patient was born full term via vaginal delivery to a healthy mother without complications. The patient has completed all vaccinations to date, including an influenza vaccine earlier this year. He has no known medical problems. The patient has never had surgery, nor has been admitted to the hospital. He does not take any medications and has no known allergies to medications or foods.Family and Social History
-------------------------

【6】The patient’s parents are married. His mother is 34 years old, healthy, does not report any medical problems, and works as a lawyer. His father is 36 years old, reports a history of hypertension, no other medical problems, and works as a registered nurse. The patient has one sister who is 12 years old, healthy, and does not have any medical problems. The patient is in the 4th grade and he does well in school.

--------------

【7】On arrival to the ED, the patient has facial angioedema, scattered hives, mild respiratory distress, and appears scared. His respiratory rate is 38 breaths per minute with moderate subcostal retractions. He is wheezing and his oxygen saturations are 92% on 100% oxygen via a non‐rebreather mask. His blood pressure is 78/42 mmHg.

-------------------------------------------------

【10】### Based on the currently available data, what are the differential diagnoses and the most likely diagnosis for this child?

【11】Differential diagnoses for this child would include anaphylaxis, acute asthma exacerbation, severe croup, urticaria, foreign body aspiration, isolated angioedema, food poisoning, vasovagal episode, idiopathic capillary leak syndrome, and other causes of shock. Anaphylaxis is the most likely diagnosis due to the presentation of facial angioedema, urticaria, and respiratory compromise following an insect sting. Anaphylaxis is commonly misdiagnosed and underdiagnosed when cutaneous signs are not present, so it is important to recognize the other signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis, including, but not limited to, dizziness, hypotension, cough, stridor, dyspnea, vomiting, diarrhea, and wheezing.

【12】### What is the best way to treat this patient’s current signs and symptoms on arrival at the ED?

【13】Epinephrine continues to be the mainstay of treatment for anaphylaxis, with the greatest benefit on administration prior to ED presentation. For pediatric patients, epinephrine should be administered intramuscularly at a dose of 0.01 mg/kg of 1:1000 concentration in the vastus lateralis muscle, with a maximum dose of 0.3 mg but up to 0.5 mg in prepubertal and teenage children. All other medications, including antihistamines, inhaled beta‐agonists and glucocorticoids, are adjuvant medications that should be administered only in addition to, but not to replace, epinephrine.

【14】### How would you determine if the treatment was effective?

【15】Close monitoring for improvement of presenting signs and symptoms are paramount in determining the effectiveness of treatment. In addition, close and continuous monitoring of vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturations, during treatment and until signs and symptoms are resolved are important in determining if other signs of anaphylaxis and shock are present.

【16】### What other treatments would you recommend at this time?

【17】Additional systemic symptoms should be treated with second‐line agents following epinephrine administration, as appropriate, with particular consideration of biphasic anaphylactic reactions. Histamine H <sub>1 </sub> and H <sub>2 </sub> receptor antagonists, such as diphenhydramine and ranitidine, may be administered for cutaneous and gastrointestinal symptoms, and inhaled beta‐agonists, such as albuterol, may be administered to treat reactive airway. Intravenous fluid replacement and oxygen therapies should be provided for patients with hypoxia and hypotension.

【18】### What is the patient’s disposition?

【19】For those patients with concern for protracted or biphasic reactions, they should be monitored in the ED for approximately 3–4 hours after administration of epinephrine to assess for recurrence of symptoms. If symptoms recur, then medications should be re‐dosed for a 24‐hour period and hospitalization is warranted.

【20】Consideration should be made about a referral to an allergy and immunology specialist for treatment with venom immunotherapy for insect sting‐induced anaphylaxis. This treatment can reduce the risk of subsequent anaphylaxis to less than 5% if a full course of therapy is completed.焦瀚远
