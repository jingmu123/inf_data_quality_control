【0】CASE 58: A GIRL WITH A LIMP

【1】History

【2】Janis is a 12-year-old girl who presents to the paediatric rapid referral clinic with a 4-month history of an intermittent pain in her left hip with an associated limp. The pain is worse on running  删除换行1 and she has stopped participating in her physical education classes at school. She occasionally  删除换行1 takes ibuprofen that provides some pain relief. There is no history of trauma. She is generally well.
She had a tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy at 5 years of age. Her mother has hypothyroidism.

【3】Examination

【4】She is apyrexial. She has an obvious limp. The left hip is flexed and there is a restriction of internal rotation, abduction and flexion. There are no signs in the left knee or foot and there are no  删除换行1 other joint abnormalities. The back is normal. There are no abdominal signs and no neurological  删除换行1 signs in the lower limbs. Janis’s weight, at 55.4 kg, is between the 91st and 98th centiles and her  删除换行1 height, at 1.34 m, is just below the second centile. Janis’s lateral hip X-ray is shown in Figure 58.1.

【20】ANSWER 58

【21】A limp is a common problem in childhood. It is important to be aware that it can be due to  删除换行1 an abnormality anywhere from the back to the foot.

【22】Causes of a limp in a child are best considered according to age as follows:

【23】• 0–3 Years

【24】• Trauma, e.g. fracture (may be accidental or non-accidental)

【25】• Infections, e.g. septic arthritis, osteomyelitis or discitis

【26】• Malignancy

【27】• Developmental dysplasia of the hip

【28】• Neuromuscular disease, e.g. cerebral palsy

【29】• 4–10 Years

【30】• Trauma

【31】• Transient synovitis (irritable hip)

【32】• Infection – septic arthritis, osteomyelitis or discitis

【33】• Perthe’s disease

【34】• Juvenile idiopathic arthritis

【35】• Malignancy, e.g. leukaemia

【36】• Neuromuscular disease, e.g. cerebral palsy

【37】• 10–18 Years

【38】• Trauma

【39】• Infection, e.g. septic arthritis, osteomyelitis or discitis

【40】• Slipped upper femoral epiphysis

【41】• Juvenile idiopathic arthritis

【42】• Malignancy, e.g. osteogenic sarcoma

【43】The diagnosis is a slipped upper femoral epiphysis (SUFE). SUFE is commoner in boys and in  删除换行1 obese individuals. Pain can be felt in the groin, hip or thigh or there may be referred pain in  删除换行1 the knee. Classically, the affected hip is flexed and the leg is externally rotated. A small slip  删除换行1 may be missed on the anteroposterior view, therefore a lateral or frog leg view of the hip is  删除换行1 also necessary. The lateral X-ray shows displacement of the proximal femoral epiphysis relative to the femoral neck. Approximately 25 per cent of patients will also have a contralateral  删除换行1 slip and the other hip must therefore be carefully assessed.

【44】A minority of patients with SUFE have an underlying endocrinopathy or metabolic abnormality (hypothyroidism, hypogonadism, growth hormone abnormalities, panhypopituitarism or renal osteodystrophy) and if this is suspected, then the appropriate investigations  删除换行1 should be performed. Janis is short and overweight and has a family history of thyroid disease. A more detailed examination demonstrated that she had a small goitre. Thyroid function tests revealed a free T4 of 9.2 pmol/L 通用删除7(英):<u>(12–22)</u>, a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) of  删除换行1 64 mU/L (0.5–6.0) and thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies of 1342 IU/mL 通用删除7(英):<u>(0–34)</u>. These  删除换行1 results are compatible with a diagnosis of Hashimoto’s (autoimmune) thyroiditis, and she  删除换行1 should be started on thyroxine. Obese individuals should have investigations looking at the  删除换行1 causes (such as hypothyroidism) and consequences (such as type 2 diabetes) of obesity.

【45】Janis should be admitted and told not to weight-bear. She should be referred urgently to the  删除换行1 orthopaedic surgeons. Although it would seem that the SUFE has been present for 4 months,  删除换行1 one can get an acute or chronic slip of the epiphysis that can lead to avascular necrosis of the  删除换行1 femoral head. Surgery is therefore urgent and consists of pinning the femoral head to the  删除换行1 femoral neck.

【46】Key Points

【47】• In SUFE, a lateral or frog leg view, as well as an anteroposterior view, of the hip is  删除换行1 necessary to avoid missing minor slips.

【48】• Urgent treatment is necessary in SUFE to try to avoid the complication of avascular  删除换行1 necrosis of the femoral head.王磊
