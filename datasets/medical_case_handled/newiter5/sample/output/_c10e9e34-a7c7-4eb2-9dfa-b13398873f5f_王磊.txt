【21】Questions

【22】•	 What is the likely diagnosis?

【23】•	 What is the appropriate management?

【24】ANSWER 84

【25】The most likely diagnosis is a variceal bleed due to underlying chronic liver disease secondary to alcohol. He has signs of chronic liver disease and his liver function tests are  删除换行1 consistent with this. Other causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with liver  删除换行1 disease include peptic ulcer disease, Mallory–Weiss tear, portal hypertensive gastropathy  删除换行1 and gastric antral vascular ectasia. Thrombocytopenia is common in cirrhosis due to a  删除换行1 combination of reduced thrombopoietin levels, splenic sequestration of platelets and bone  删除换行1 marrow suppression.

【26】The estimation of blood loss is often difficult from a patient’s story. Haematemesis is a frightening symptom and the amount may be overestimated. The haemoglobin level in this case is  删除换行1 low and there is significant postural hypotension. His pulse is not fast as he is taking a beta  删除换行1 blocker. He has signs of chronic liver disease. This is likely to be a very serious bleed. Only  删除换行1 50% of patients with varcieal haemorrhage stop bleeding spontaneously, and there is a very  删除换行1 high risk of bleeding in the next 6 weeks.

【27】The patient needs to be resuscitated with transfusion via a large-bore peripheral intravenous  删除换行1 line or a central line. FFP and platelets are needed to correct coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia, respectively. Intravenous antibiotics reduce infectious complications in hospitalised  删除换行1 cirrhotic patients.

【28】Endoscopy is required to identify the bleeding point. Bleeding oesophageal varices should  删除换行1 be treated with oesophageal band ligation or sclerotherapy. Balloon tamponade is effective at  删除换行1 achieving short-term haemostasis, and may be used until more definitive treatment is available. Terlipressin or octreotide reduce bleeding. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic  删除换行1 shunts or surgery are reserved for patients who continue to bleed despite the above measures.

【29】After he has been stabilised he needs to be asked questions about his alcohol intake. He  删除换行1 should be advised to abstain from alcohol. CAGE criteria consist of four questions and are  删除换行1 commonly used as a screen for alcoholism:

【30】•	 Have you felt the need to Cut down drinking?

【31】•	 Have you ever felt Annoyed by criticism of drinking?

【32】•	 Have you had Guilty feelings about drinking?

【33】•	 Did you ever take a morning Eye opener?

【34】Key Points

【35】•	 Acute variceal bleeds are less likely to stop spontaneously than other upper  删除换行1 gastrointestinal haemorrhages.

【36】•	 The CAGE questionnaire is useful as a screening tool for alcoholism.

【37】•	 In some surveys alcohol is linked directly to around 25% of acute medical admissions.王磊
