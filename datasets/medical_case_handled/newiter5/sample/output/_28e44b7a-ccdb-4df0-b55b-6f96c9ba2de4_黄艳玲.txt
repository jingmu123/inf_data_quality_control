【1】### CASE 26

【2】A 28-year-old man presents to the emergency center with a 48-hour complaint of headache and nausea. The headache is primarily in the frontal and occipital regions and associated with mild nausea. He has taken various over-the-counter analgesics without any improvement in the headache. The intensity of the headache has gradually increased since it began prompting evaluation as he was no longer able to tolerate it. His only other symptom besides nausea is tightness in the shoulders and neck. He is not known to have any medical illnesses, and there is no history of head trauma. On examination, he has a temperature of 32.8°C (100.8°F); blood pressure, 110/68 mmHg; and pulse, of 100 beats/min. He is awake and alert and fully oriented. His Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) is normal; however, he feels he is taking too much time to answer the questions. His general examination is notable for the finding of a Kernig sign without evidence of any skin rash. A Brudzinski sign is not present. Cranial nerves are normal except for bilateral horizontal nystagmus. His motor, sensory, and cerebellar examinations are normal. The deep tendon reflexes are hyperreflexic throughout without evidence of a Babinski sign. A CT scan of the head is performed without contrast, which is read as normal. Importantly his headache is worse now than what it was when he presented to the emergency room.

【9】• Best diagnostic step : Lumbar puncture

【10】• Next step in therapy : Start IV antibiotics and IV acyclovir

【11】#### ANALYSIS

【12】##### Objectives

【13】1\. Know the clinical presentation of meningitis.

【14】2\. Learn to develop a diagnostic strategy for the diagnosis of meningitis and understand the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings in bacterial and viral meningitis.

【15】3\. Know the treatment strategy for meningitis in the emergency room.

【16】##### Considerations

【17】The presentation of a crescendo headache associated with nausea, fever, and slowness in responding to questions should alert the clinician of meningitis or encephalitis. The presence of neck tightness and a Kernig sign is consistent with meningitis. The lumbar puncture CSF study is the best way to determine the etiology of meningitis in order to distinguish between a bacterial versus viral etiology. Although CSF studies are critical to identifying the cause of the meningitis, an imaging study with either a brain CT or MRI scan is preferably done prior to the spinal tap. Although the MRI brain scan offers better resolution than a CT head scan, it may not always be readily available. The study of choice between the latter is based on what can be done the quickest. The importance of the imaging studies is to help exclude increased intracranial pressure caused by impaired CSF drainage or a space-occupying lesion. Focal neurologic findings or the presence of papilledema mandate on an imaging study . Once it is determined that the risk of herniation is low, a lumbar puncture is performed. Lumbar puncture analysis should include opening and closing pressure, and CSF studies for glucose, protein, cell count with differential, Gram stain, culture, latex particle agglutination, herpes simplex virus (HSV) polymerase chain reaction (PCR), enteroviral (EV) reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR, Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL), and extra CSF retained for additional studies. Other tests to consider include chemistry 20, complete blood count (CBC) with differential and platelets, international normalized ratio (INR)/prothrombin time (PT)/partial thromboplastin time (PTT), HIV, blood cultures. However, if there is a delay in obtaining an imaging study, blood cultures should be taken from the patient, and empiric IV antibiotics should be started immediately. The initial choice of antibiotics is customarily a third-generation cephalosporin such as ceftriaxone or cefotaxime plus vancomycin, IV dexamethasone, IV acyclovir. These should be given after blood and CSF are collected, or even when there is a delay in obtaining a lumbar puncture.

【18】### APPROACH TO: Suspected Meningitis

【19】#### DEFINITIONS

【20】MENINGITIS : Inflammation of the membranes of the brain and spinal cord (meninges) caused by many different organisms.

【21】KERNIG SIGN : The inability to completely extend the leg when the hip is flexed in the supine position. This is caused by severe stiffness in the hamstring muscles from inflammation of the lumbosacral roots.

【22】BRUDZINSKI SIGN : Flexion of the neck causes involuntary flexion of the thighs and the legs.

【23】LATEX PARTICLE AGGLUTINATION : A test where an antibody or antigen coats the surface of latex particles (sensitized latex). When a sample containing the specific antigen or antibody is mixed with the milky appearing sensitized latex, visible agglutination is noted. It is used to detect Haemophilus influenzae type b, Streptococcus pneumoniae , and Neisseria meningitidis A, B, and C soluble antigens.

【24】HSV PCR : Polymerase chain reaction is a molecular technique that allows a small amount of DNA to be replicated and amplified. In this case, HSV DNA is detected. HSV PCR for CSF has an estimated sensitivity of 95% and specificity of almost 100%.

【25】EV RT-PCR : Enteroviral reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction is a technique in which cDNA is made from RNA via reverse transcription. The cDNA is then replicated and amplified through standard PCR protocols. In this particular case, various viruses belonging to the enterovirus family can be detected.

【26】NYSTAGMUS : A rapid involuntary oscillatory movement of the eyes.

【27】#### CLINICAL APPROACH

【28】##### Etiology

【29】The most common causes of viral meningitis in the United States are viruses from the enterovirus family. Approximately 75,000 cases of enterovirus meningitis occur in the United States each year. Coxsackie A9, B3–5, and echovirus 4, 6, 7, 8, 11, 18, and 30 are the most common strains. The infection is spread by fecal–oral route; although, spread through the respiratory route is noted rarely. Outbreaks can be associated with pharyngitis or gastroenteritis and occur in the late summer and early fall. There can be a viral exanthem present. Other viral causes of meningitis include HSV, arboviruses (St. Louis encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, Western equine encephalitis virus, Eastern equine encephalitis, and La Crosse virus), Arenaviruses, and retroviruses. The arboviruses are viruses that are transmitted to humans via arthropods, most commonly mosquitoes or ticks.

【30】In contrast, bacterial meningitis is typically more severe and carries a higher morbidity and mortality rate when compared to viral meningitis. The incidence of bacterial meningitis is approximately 3 to 5 per 100,000 people per year in the United States. Annually, 2000 deaths have been reported in the United States from bacterial meningitis. The relative frequency of bacterial species as a cause of meningitis varies with age. During the neonatal period, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes , and group B streptococci account for most of the causes of neonatal meningitis. Following the neonatal period, H influenza, S pneumoniae , and N meningitidis account for 80% of cases. In 1987, widespread vaccination against H influenza type B led to a marked reduction in this pathogen causing meningitis in children. Streptococcal pneumonia and Neisseria meningitis are now the principal causes of meningitis after the neonatal period.

【31】##### Clinical Presentation and Evaluation

【32】Typical symptoms of meningitis include the classic triad of headache, fever, and neck stiffness . Other symptoms include photophobia (eye pain or sensitivity to light), nausea, vomiting, myalgia confusion, declining levels of consciousness (from lethargy to coma), seizures, and focal neurologic deficits such as cranial nerve palsies, hemiparesis, or dysphasia, because of ischemic strokes caused by secondary thrombosis or inflammation of cerebral vessels.

【33】In evaluating patients with meningitis, it is critical to differentiate between a bacterial and viral or other type of meningitis. Certain findings on clinical examination can point toward a bacterial infection rather than a viral infection. For example, the presence of a very high fever or widespread macular papular rash or the presence of purpura or ecchymosis suggests a bacterial infection such as Neisseria meningitis. CSF studies, however, are more definitive and will allow the differentiation between viral and bacterial meningitis. CSF studies in viral meningitis may reveal an elevated opening pressure, normal glucose, elevated CSF cell counts from 200 to >1000 white blood cells/µL with no more than 50% polymorphonuclear cells. However, within the first 24 hours of infection, up to 90% of white blood cells can be polymorphonuclear cells. Viral CSF cultures have a relatively low sensitivity and poor ability to grow. Furthermore, the clinical utility of this is limited by the amount of time requiring the enterovirus to grow (days to weeks). The EV RT-PCR on CSF has 100% specificity and 95% sensitivity. Results are often available within 4 hours.

【34】CSF studies in bacterial meningitis reveal an elevated opening pressure (greater than 200 mm of H <sub class="calibre12">2 </sub> O), elevated protein 100 mg/dL to 500 mg/dL (normal 15 mg/dL to 45 mg/dL), reduced glucose (less than 40% serum glucose), and pleocytosis (100 to 10,000 white blood cells/µL; normal <5) with 60% or greater polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Sixty percent of bacterial meningitis cases will have a positive Gram stain result with approximately 75% having a positive CSF culture. Blood cultures will pick up the causative organism of bacterial meningitis in 50% of cases emphasizing the fact that bacteremia is present early on and explains why bacterial meningitis is a true medical emergency. Antibiotics administered up to 2 hours before a lumbar puncture do not decrease the sensitivity of CSF culture done in conjunction with latex particle agglutination and blood cultures. Antibiotics administered for longer than 2 hours before a lumbar puncture may decrease the findings of a positive Gram stain or positive culture in the CSF by 5% to 40%.

【35】In most cases of viral meningitis, the neuroimaging studies are normal, however, a key exception is HSV meningitis in which there can be evidence of hemorrhage in the temporal lobe region Neuroimaging studies in bacterial meningitis are often normal but can also reveal complications such as infarction, venous sinus thrombosis, communicating or noncommunicating hydrocephalus, and increased intracranial pressure.

【36】##### Treatment

【37】The key in reducing morbidity and mortality in patients with meningitis is rapid recognition so that treatment can be implemented. This means identifying the causative agent as soon as possible. Many of the indicated diagnostic tests take several hours before results are available making it impossible to wait for the results before treatment is instituted. As a result, treatment with antibiotics and/or retrovirals is started while waiting for test results 删除33：<u></u>. Penicillin G or ampicillin and a third-generation cephalosporin are typical first-line agents for the treatment of bacterial meningitis. However, the drug resistance has started to become a frequent problem, and as a result, treatment recommendations are changing based on local resistance patterns. Ampicillin covers most pneumococcus, meningococcus, and Listeria. Ceftriaxone or cefotaxime, third-generation cephalosporins, cover gram-negative organisms as well as ampicillin-resistant H influenza . Vancomycin is added to third-generation cephalosporins to cover Staphylococcus aureus when patients have undergone recent neurosurgical procedures or head trauma or if the sensitivity for S pneumoniae is unknown. Aminoglycosides are added to treat gram-positive bacilli and gram-negative bacilli.

【39】Adjuvant therapy with intravenous corticosteroids for bacterial meningitis is clearly indicated in children to reduce complications such as deafness, mental retardation, or epilepsy. In adults, the use of intravenous corticosteroids is not as clear. There is some evidence to suggest that penetration of vancomycin into CSF is reduced by the administration of corticosteroids. Additionally, corticosteroids can mask clinical signs for antibody response. However, recent studies have shown the benefit in preventing systemic complications as well as neurologic deficits in adult patients with S pneumoniae meningitis when corticosteroids are given.

【40】As of yet, there is no effective treatment for viral meningitis except if HSV is suspected. The treatment for HSV meningitis is intravenous acyclovir. HSV meningitis infrequently presents in patients at the time of their first episode of genital herpes. Approximately, 11% of men and 36% of women with genital herpes will exhibit symptoms consistent with HSV meningitis. Immunocompromised patients may be at more risk for HSV meningitis as well. In adults, the prognosis for recovery is excellent, although some patients will have residual headache. Sensorineural hearing loss can occur especially in children. Infants and neonates can have more serious long-term sequelae such as cognitive deficits or learning disabilities. In contrast, herpes encephalitis is the most common cause of sporadic viral encephalitis, with the predilection for the temporal lobes. The clinical presentation can range from aseptic meningitis and fever to severe rapidly progressive forms with significant mortality of the latter.
