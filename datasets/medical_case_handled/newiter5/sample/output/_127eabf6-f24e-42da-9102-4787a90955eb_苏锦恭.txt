【0】CASE 47: I’M IMPOTENT

【1】History

【2】A 30-year-old man comes to see you in the general practitioner surgery. He is embarrassed  删除换行1 and explains that he was married last year and is having problems with his sex life. In particular he mentions that since he was married he has had problems maintaining an erection  删除换行1 when he is with his wife. He says that when he has been able to get an erection he often has  删除换行1 a premature ejaculation. His wife has not been able to achieve orgasm. She has been very  删除换行1 understanding and says that she does not mind, but he is concerned that there is something  删除换行1 very wrong with him. He says that their relationship is good and he is very much in love with  删除换行1 his wife. He has not told her that he is seeking advice. On further questioning he indicates  删除换行1 that before he married he was a virgin, but that he did masturbate regularly and had sustained erections. He still occasionally masturbates in private and can sustain an erection for  删除换行1 at least 5 minutes. His erections are normal and not painful. Brief systemic enquiry is normal. He has no polydipsia, polyuria, frequency, other urological symptoms or cardiovascular  删除换行1 symptoms. He is an amateur football player who plays regularly and has not had any difficulties recently with fitness. He drinks socially at weekends only and is a non-smoker. He can  删除换行1 still enjoy himself with his friends and his wife and denies any low mood. His work as owner  删除换行1 of a small plumbing firm is going well.

【3】Physical examination

【4】He is clearly anxious and embarrassed. When you put him at his ease by explaining that the  删除换行1 consultation is confidential and that this is a common problem with one in ten men experiencing it at some time, he becomes more relaxed. There is no evidence of any serious mental  删除换行1 illness.

【5】He has a pulse of 88 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 125/75 mm Hg. His heart  删除换行1 sounds are normal. He is fit and appears healthy. His body mass index is 22. There are no  删除换行1 penile, testicular or scrotal abnormalities, and he has normal muscle and hair distribution.
The pulses in his legs and feet are normal. Neurological examination is also normal including  删除换行1 reflexes, fundi, visual fields and motor power. Urine stick test is normal with no sugar.

【6】Questions

【7】• What possible differential diagnoses go through your mind?

【8】• Should you refer him on to a specialist urologist?

【9】• What advice can you give him?

【10】ANSWER 47

【11】Erectile dysfunction can be caused by cardiovascular problems (e.g. vascular disease in diabetes) reducing blood flow to the area, but the fact that this man can sustain an erection at  删除换行1 other times, and the normal cardiovascular examination, make this unlikely. There is no evidence that he has low testosterone. Visual field defects are absent and there is no evidence of  删除换行1 raised intracranial pressure or brain pathology. Smoking and alcohol consumption can affect  删除换行1 sexual function. This is not obviously present but it will be worth asking more questions about  删除换行1 potential illicit drug use or use of any other medications (neuroleptics and antihypertensives  删除换行1 would be the usual culprits). Nervous system disorders that affect sexual function tend to be  删除换行1 those affecting older people such as Parkinson’s disease, cerebrovascular accident or multiple  删除换行1 sclerosis, although trauma to the spine may also affect function. All of these are ruled out here  删除换行1 by history and examination. Some local cancers or local disease (e.g. Peyronie disease) can be  删除换行1 ruled out by normal appearance and the absence of pain or other symptoms. Aggressive cancer  删除换行1 treatment or treatments for some systemic diseases can also affect erectile function.

【12】There is no evidence of any physical illness. A referral to a urologist is likely to make him  删除换行1 more anxious and is unnecessary at this point. The most likely diagnosis is that this man’s  删除换行1 problems are psychological. He is able to sustain a normal erection when he is not with his  删除换行1 wife and he clearly has a high level of performance anxiety. This has been reinforced by experiences of premature ejaculation. Research shows that problems such as this can be greatly  删除换行1 reduced by reduction in anxiety about performance.

【13】In the first instance a lot of reassurance will help, as well as some literature to help him understand how the body works sexually and about different sexual needs within relationships.
It will also help to explain the importance of the mind, expectations and circumstances in  删除换行1 sexual relationships, and various self-help books may help him here. If these strategies do not  删除换行1 work then he should return to you for other alternatives. It could be helpful to talk with him  删除换行1 and his spouse together since it is difficult to fully understand the problems of one person in  删除换行1 the relationship when sexuality is often expressed in a dynamic between two people. Discuss  删除换行1 this option with him but respect his wishes. The attitudes and expectations of his wife may  删除换行1 be relevant, and the solution may need to involve them both. It may be that a local couple’s  删除换行1 therapy or psychosexual clinic would help them. In this case, for example, it may be helpful  删除换行1 to take the performance of sexuality out of the equation and ask them to explore each other’s  删除换行1 bodies through massage and caressing with an instruction not to have intercourse. It may be  删除换行1 that mutual masturbation (if acceptable to them culturally) will allow him to see that he can  删除换行1 maintain erection and reduce subsequent performance anxiety. Exploring sexuality together  删除换行1 will also allow them as a couple to better understand each other’s needs and preferences.

【14】Many people’s problems disappear with time and reassurance. A request to visit you again  删除换行1 should the problem persist would allow you to review the situation and make a referral to a psychosexual clinic for support, if the problem does not resolve with reassurance and information.

【15】Key Points

【16】• Many people are anxious about sexual performance, especially in a new  删除换行1 relationship.

【17】• Simple advice and reassurance may be effective, with follow-up should the  删除换行1 situation not improve with time.

【18】• A psychosexual clinic can sometimes be helpful if problems persist.
