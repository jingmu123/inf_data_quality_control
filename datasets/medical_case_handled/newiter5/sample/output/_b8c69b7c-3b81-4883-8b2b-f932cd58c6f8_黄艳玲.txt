【0】CASE 16

【1】A 57-year-old woman with a history of eczema presents to her primary care physician with a new rash near the nipple of her right breast. She tells her doctor that the rash first appeared 2 months ago，and that she had been treating it with the topical corticosteroid prescribed for her eczema. At first the rash improved somewhat， but over the past few weeks it has gotten worse and has expanded in size. Physical examination reveals a raw， scaly lesion around the nipple that is beginning to ulcerate. There is also a palpable mass in the affected breast， a few centimeters deep to the skin lesion.

【2】What is the most likely diagnosis?

【3】Paget disease of the breast， an eczematous skin lesion in the area of the nipple， is associated with underlying invasive or in situ breast carcinoma 删除33：<u></u>. In approximately 50% of cases， Paget disease is associated with a palpable breast mass. Paget disease is often mistaken for a benign skin lesion such as eczema. FIGURE 13-8.

New York： McGraw-Hill，2005： 495.\] What is the pathophysiology of this condition? The skin lesion likely develops from underlying mammary adenocarcinoma cells that migrate through the ducts to the epidermis. However， an alternative theory suggests that epidermal keratinocytes transform into malignant cells independent of the underlying carcinoma. What are the most likely findings on histology? Histology often shows large cells with a halo of clear cytoplasm surrounding a prominent nucleolus. Additionally， the cytoplasm stains positive for mucin. What are the most common sites of metastasis for breast carcinoma?·Bone is the most common site for metastatic disease.·Other common organ sites include liver and lung.· Less common sites include bone marrow， brain， ovaries， spinal cord， and eye. What is the lymphatic drainage of the breast? pectoral (majority of drainage)， apical， subscapular， lateral， and central node groups. The nipple drains to</u>
Approximately 75% of lymphatic drainage of the breast is to the axillary lymph nodes， which include the the pectoral group. The remaining lymph drains to the infraclavicular， supraclavicular， and parasternal (also known as the internal thoracic) nodes. To assess for lymph node metastasis in breast cancer， a sentinel lymph node biopsy is performed. To do this， a dye is injected into the tumor， and the first lymph node that the tumor drains into is dyed first. This lymph node is then biopsied to assess for lymphatic invasion.

【4】Molecular analysis of a biopsy reveals that the cells express c-erbB-2 in high levels. What is the significance of this， and how does it affect treatment?

【5】The human epithelial growth factor receptor(HER)-2/neu (also known as c-erbB-2) protein is a transmembrane growth factor receptor kinase. Overexpression of this molecule (present in 18%-20% of breast cancers) has been associated with a poorer prognosis. The drug trastuzumab is a humanized recombinant monoclonal antibody directed against thisprotein. The binding of trastuzumab to the extracellular portion of the molecule stimulates a cytotoxic immune response， leading to death of the cancer cells.黄艳玲
