【1】Pemphigus foliaceus
-------------------

【2】QUESTION 12

【3】A 71-year-old woman presents to a dermatology clinic with a scaly, crusted rash on the chest and back. She states that they began to develop as blisters initially, but would burst within a day and leave behind a scaly rash that is mildly painful and pruritic. She denies any recent illness or changes to her personal care products. On examination, there are scattered erythematous and hyperpigmented macules and papules with overlying scale and secondary excoriations on the upper chest and back 通用删除7(英):<u>( 12 )</u>. There is no involvement of the oral or genital mucosa.

【4】i. What is the most likely diagnosis? What molecule is most likely to be targeted in the pathology of this disease?

【5】ii. What are the characteristic features on histology and immunofluorescence studies? What substrate should be used for indirect immunofluorescence studies?

【6】iii. What is the first-line treatment of choice?

【7】Answer 12

【8】i. The patient’s history and the clinical presentation are most consistent with pemphigus foliaceus, a form of pemphigus. In most populations, pemphigus vulgaris is more common than pemphigus foliaceus, except among the populations of Finland, Tunisia and Brazil. Unlike pemphigus vulgaris, pemphigus foliaceus rarely involves the oral mucosa. It is caused by the development of IgG autoantibodies against desmoglein-1 (DSG1), a protein found in desmosomes in the keratinocytes of the skin.

【9】Clinically, patients develop scattered scaly, crusted erosions often distributed on the scalp, face and upper trunk. The primary lesions are vesicles and bullae but are typically so superficial and fragile that the resultant crust and scale are the main findings on examination.

【10】ii. On histopathologic examination, blisters in pemphigus foliaceus demonstrate acantholysis in the upper epidermis, often similar in appearance to that seen in staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome or bullous impetigo. On direct immunofluorescence studies, IgG deposition can be seen on the keratinocyte cell surfaces. Indirect immunofluorescence performed on a guinea pig esophagus can be used to detect anti-DSG1 autoantibodies.

【11】iii. In localized disease, pemphigus foliaceus can be managed with potent topical corticosteroids. For more widespread and active disease, systemic medications such as those used for pemphigus vulgaris are used, including prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil and other immunosuppressants.苏锦恭
