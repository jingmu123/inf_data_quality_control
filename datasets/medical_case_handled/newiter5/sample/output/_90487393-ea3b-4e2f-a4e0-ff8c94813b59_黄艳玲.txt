【9】Case Presentation
-----------------

【10】A 30-year old African American female presented with a 2-year history of intermittent bumps on her face. She had previously tried numerous over the counter treatments, including topical benzoyl peroxide foams and salicylic acid cleansers. She also used shea butter on her face to help even out her skin tone. Her menstrual cycles were normal.

【11】Physical Examination
--------------------

【12】On examination, multiple erythematous papules and pustules and enlarged pores were noted on the cheeks, nose, jawline, and chin. Hyperpigmented macules were also noted on the cheeks and the jawline. A 1 cm erythematous cyst was noted on the right nasal sidewall 删除33：<u></u>. Hyperpigmented macules and papules were noted on the chest and upper back.

【15】Differential Diagnosis
----------------------

【16】Comedonal acne should be distinguished from acneiform eruptions from follicular occlusion, like pomade and occupational acne. Sebaceous hyperplasia, characterized by yellowish, indurated papules on the forehead and cheeks, is common in adults. Inflammatory acne can be confused with folliculitis (staphylococcal, gram negative, or eosinophilic). Lesions from folliculitis are typically monomorphic papules, and comedones are not present. Papulopustular rosacea favors the forehead, malar region, and the chin. Patients also have telangiectasias and report a history of flushing. Although rosacea typically occurs at a later age, both acne and rosacea can occur in a single individual. Perioral dermatitis is characterized by monomorphic papules and pustules, usually resulting from prolonged use of corticosteroids. Neurotic excoriations on the face, chest, and back can also be confused with acne 删除10：<u>(Zaenglein and Thiboutot 2008 )</u>.

【17】Histopathology
--------------

【18】Acne is a clinical diagnosis, and biopsy is typically not indicated. However, biopsy of an acneiform lesion shows a microcomedo with infundibular dilatation and narrowing of the follicular opening. As the follicular epithelium distends, cystic contents rupture into the dermis. The acute inflammatory reaction is characterized by neutrophils creating pustules, foreign body granulation tissue, and subsequent end stage scarring 删除10：<u>(Zaenglein and Thiboutot 2008 )</u>.

【21】Case Treatment
--------------

【22】A gentle cleanser was recommended for both morning and evening. A combination benzoyl peroxide/clindamycin gel was recommended for the morning, and a tretinoin 0.1 % cream was recommended for the evening. The patient was also started on doxycycline 100 mg twice daily. A moisturizer with a broad spectrum sunscreen (SPF 30) was recommended for the morning. This same moisturizer was recommended for the evening to prevent irritation from tretinoin. She was advised to discontinue her use of shea butter, as it is typically comedogenic. She was seen back in clinic in 3 months to attempt to taper the doxycycline.

【23】Discussion
----------

【24】Acne is one of the most common skin disorders in people with skin of color. Practice surveys at the Skin of Color Center in New York City 删除10：<u>(Alexis et al. 2007 )</u>, Howard University in Washington, D.C. 删除10：<u>(Halder et al. 1983 )</u>, and in south-east London 删除10：<u>(Child et al. 1999 )</u> reported that acne vulgaris was the most common diagnosis in patients with skin of color, accounting for 28 % of dermatoses.

【25】The pathogenesis of acne is due to four well known factors: excessive sebum production; abnormal follicular keratinization and plugging; proliferation of Propionobacter acnes ; Hormone changes also contribute to acne pathogenesis. 删除10：<u>(Callender 2004 ; Leyden 1995 )</u>. Although this classic pathophysiology is shared amongst all skin types, subsequent evolution of the acne lesion and the degree of inflammation at clinical presentation may vary among individuals according to their skin types. In particular, nodulocystic acne appears to be more common in Caucasians and Hispanics than in African Americans 删除10：<u>(Callender 2004 ; Taylor et al. 2002 )</u>. Pore size may also explain differences in acne presentation, as enlarged pore size is highly correlated with sebum output and may contribute to acne pathogenesis. Epidemiologic studies demonstrate that gland pores are larger in patients with skin of color 删除10：<u>(Yin and McMichael 2014 )</u>.

【26】Clinically, acne vulgaris is characterized by open and closed comedones, papules, pustules, nodules, and cysts 删除33：<u></u>. Lesions are usually present on the forehead, cheeks, jawline, chin, chest, and upper back. In patients with skin of color, postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH), characterized by hyperpigmented macules, may be present after the lesions heal 删除33：<u></u>.

【29】Although acne treatment for patients with skin of color are similar to those for patients with lighter skin, specific considerations exist, especially due to the risk of PIH. Clinically, PIH presents as hyperpigmented macules or patches which correspond to the area of injury. Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation can develop in response to the acne itself or to any overly aggressive acne treatment that disturbs the skin. Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation is thought to be a default pathophysiologic response of darker skin to cutaneous injury in which the inflammation triggers an increase in epidermal or dermal melanogenesis from labile melanocytes 删除10：<u>(Callender 2004 ; Taylor et al. 2002 )</u>. For many patients, the lingering PIH is more psychologically disturbing than the acne itself.

【30】Permanent and disfiguring keloid formation is also more common following acne in skin of color. The biologic basis for a tendency for scarring in patients with skin of color may involve differences in fibroblast size and activity, immune related cellular actions, and growth factors—all of which seem to combine to promote production of excess collagen and inhibit degradation of the extracellular matrix 删除10：<u>(Callender 2004 ; Taylor et al. 2002 )</u>.

【31】Hair care practices among patients with skin of color may also cause a unique form of acne known as pomade acne. The daily use of pomades on the hair and scalp to overcome an inherent tendency for hair dryness and fragility often leads to a characteristic distribution of comedonal acne on the forehead and anterior hair line 删除10：<u>(Callender 2004 )</u>. Additionally, corticosteroid containing skin bleaching agents that are used by some individuals with darker skin to improve hyperpigmentation may induce steroid acne, which may further worsen PIH 删除10：<u>(Shah and Alexis 2010 )</u>.

【32】Treatment
---------

【33】The treatment of acne in patients with skin of color can present unique challenges, both pathophysiologically (i.e. risk of PIH and keloid scarring) and culturally (i.e. use of skin and hair care products). The overall goal of acne management is to select treatment that addresses as many of its pathogenic factors as possible while minimizing potential PIH 删除10：<u>(Alexis et al. 2007 )</u>. Because acne treatment can cause cutaneous irritation that initiates or exacerbates PIH in darker-skinned patients, the patient’s skin should be carefully assessed to determine the risk of irritant contact dermatitis.

【34】Topical retinoids are the top choice for first line therapy, as not only do they target hyperkeratinization and comedogenesis, but they also possess direct anti-inflammatory and antifibroblastic actions, and may block the key pathophysiologic pathways leading to PIH and keloids 删除10：<u>(Callender 2004 ; Alexis 2011 )</u>. Special care should be taken in selecting the most appropriate retinoid vehicle. For skin of color, cream based formulations of retinoids are often initiated because there is a decreased likelihood of irritation and resultant PIH. Retinoid formulations may also be started on an alternate-day dosing regimen to decrease irritation. Another useful strategy is to start with the lowest concentration and titrate up as tolerated to minimize retinoid dermatitis and the risk of PIH 删除10：<u>(Alexis 2011 )</u>.

【35】Topical antibiotics like clindamycin and erythromycin are effective in reducing P. acnes and help reduce inflammation. Adding an antimicrobial agent to a topical retinoid regimen can result in a more rapid and complete resolution of acne lesions and PIH. In addition, the use of a fixed combination agent (topical antibiotic plus benzoyl peroxide) is recommended to assist in preventing new acne lesions and reduces the risk of antibiotic resistance 删除10：<u>(Alexis 2014 )</u>. Reducing potential irritation and dryness, which may adversely affect darker skin, can be achieved by using benzoyl peroxide in low concentrations and in a cream or water-based gel.

【36】Azelaic acid has been used to treat both inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions. Because azelaic acid is considered to have a low potential for irritation, it may be suitable for patients with dark sensitive skin or with a history of PIH. Furthermore, because it inhibits melanin synthesis, it is also somewhat effective in treating PIH 删除10：<u>(Webster 2000 )</u>.

【37】Hydroquinone is the gold standard for treating PIH associated with acne. Hydroquinone inhibits conversion of tyrosine to melanin and alters several normal activities of the melanosomes. It is important to monitor extended hydroquinone use to avoid risk of exogenous ochronosis, which is characterized by asymptomatic blue-black or slate-gray speckled macules typically affecting the malar eminences, temples, and inferior cheeks. Although uncommon in the United States 删除10：<u>(Lawrence et al. 1988 )</u>, hydroquinone induced exogenous ochronosis of the face can be difficult to treat. The more common adverse effects of hydroquinone include irritant and allergic contact dermatitis and temporary hypopigmentation of surrounding normal skin. Therefore, it is important to use only on dark areas, not for full facial treatment 删除10：<u>(Callender 2004 )</u>.

【38】Broad spectrum antibiotics like doxycycline, minocycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and cephalosporins are often added to topical medications for moderate to severe inflammatory acne. There is a preference for doxycycline over minocycline given the risk of bluish pigmentation deposition in acne scars with minocycline. Isotretinoin, a systemic retinoid, is the treatment for nodulocystic acne. Isotretinoin must be used with caution in child bearing women given its risk of teratogenicity. Androgens also play a central role in over stimulation of sebaceous glands in patients with acne. To counteract the androgenic hormones, a variety of hormonal therapies have been used, including oral contraceptives and androgen receptor blockers (i.e. spironolactone) 删除10：<u>(Callender 2004 )</u>. In skin of color, a lower threshold for systemic agents may be advisable to reduce inflammation at an earlier stage, thus reducing the risk of PIH and scarring.

【39】Adjunct therapies reserved for cases of advanced acne, include intralesional corticosteroids (especially for keloids), manual comedonal extraction, and chemical peels. Salicylic acid peels are generally safe and effective in skin of color. They are comedolytic, accelerate the clearance of epidermal melanin, and increase the penetration of topical agents 删除10：<u>(Grimes 1999 )</u>. Although chemical peels can be used safely in skin of color, they should be applied conservatively, with careful consideration of any irritation that may result in PIH.

【40】In addition to combination therapy, certain practical measures should be taken to identify and reduce exacerbating factors. First, a careful patient history should be obtained to review what patients have used to treat acne on their own. Many patients with PIH use products such as cocoa butter to attempt to even their skin tone; however, these products can be comedogenic and exacerbate acne. A careful history of hair care product use is also important, since certain hair emollients can exacerbate acne 删除10：<u>(Callender et al. 2014 )</u>. In addition, patients should be counseled to avoid harsh exfoliants, which may contribute to PIH by causing irritation. A careful history may reveal that some patients have tried online “fade creams” that paradoxically contain corticosteroids, which in turn increase acne and subsequent PIH. Finally, many skin of color patients believe that their skin is resistant to effects of ultraviolet radiation. Therefore, the daily use of a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 should be recommended to help prevent exacerbation of PIH. A noncomedogenic vehicle should be selected 删除10：<u>(Callender et al. 2014 )</u>.

【41】Key Points

【42】   Management of acne in patients with skin of color can be particularly challenging, given their potential for cosmetically disturbing complications, including postinflammatory hyperpigmentation and keloids.
   The overall goal of acne management is to select a treatment that addresses as many pathogenic factors as possible while minimizing potential postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.
   Acne treatments designed to dry the skin, such as benzoyl peroxide, should be carefully chosen. These medications may irritate the skin and prolong post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.
   Hair care practices using oil based products may cause pomade acne.
   Comedogenic moisturizers or steroid based fade creams can worsen acne in skin of color.黄艳玲
