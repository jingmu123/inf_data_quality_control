【0】Question: 7.1 What is the single most important ethical principle to consider in deciding clinical issues?

【1】A. Autonomy.

【2】B. Justice.

【3】C. Nonmaleficence and beneficence considered together.

【4】D. There is no single most important ethical principle. The 4 principles are weighed against one another as they apply to the particulars of a clinical situation.

【5】Answer: 7.1 D. It is tempting, especially in an individualistic culture, to choose the principle of respect for autonomy as the “single most important principle.” However, it is not true that respect for autonomy trumps the other principles. The 4 principles are intended to provide a frame or template of the primary values, which must be considered in determining morally defensible action in health care. Their application to the particular case under consideration provides an opportunity to weigh their relative importance against one another, all things considered.

【6】Question: 7.2 What is the primary reason health care institutions have developed ethics committees?

【7】A. The US federal government requires ethics committees as a way to insure consumer input.

【8】B. In a morally diverse culture such as ours, ethics committees have promoted discourse on ethical issues in clinical care, ensuring discussion about ethical issues in health care from all the stakeholders involved.

【9】C. Licensing regulations for hospitals require ethics committees.

【10】D. Ethics committees grew out of the focus on patient’s rights and are an attempt to equalize the imbalance of power that clinicians hold over patients.

【11】Answer: 7.2 B. Health care ethics committees were borne out of the need for a forum for discourse between the various stakeholders in medical decisions, when technology development created situations in which determining the “right” thing to do or the “good” choice was not clear. Encouraged by legal requirements and accrediting bodies, they were developed to meet the need for moral deliberation in a diverse society with regard to the applications and opportunities of newly developing technology in health care delivery.

【12】Question: 7.3 The purpose of ethics consultation in clinical care is to do which of the following?

【13】A. Provide a “court of last resort” in controversies and conflicts that arise in care of patients.

【14】B. Create forum for venting the frustrations and difficulties of complex acute patient care.

【15】C. Promote an ethical resolution of the problem presented in a particular case by establishing respectful communication among all the parties involved.

【16】D. Clarifying the legal limits and rights to all the parties involved in a case conflict.
Answer: 7.3 C. Health care ethics consultation aims to create the space and conditions for respectful dialogue among all the moral stakeholders involved in the care of a patient, including the voice of the patient and family members. In modern health care, it is no longer defendable that the good of the patient is determined solely by the attending physician. Although differences in power and authority continue to challenge our claim of “patient- and family-centered care” and well-functioning and egalitarian “health care delivery teams,” our aim is to attempt to preserve the voice and perspective of the patient (autonomy), the intent and obligations of clinicians (beneficence and nonmaleficence), and, to do this fairly (justice), our human imperfections require the space and encouragement as well as a format for managing our conflicts and uncertainties as we work together for the well-being of the patient.

【17】KEY POINTS

【18】 In a morally diverse society such as ours, a forum is needed to facilitate discourse in situations of moral uncertainty or conflict. The forum that has developed in health care institutions is the ethics committee.

【19】 There has been an explosion of ethical questions in health care due to the development of technology coupled with strong respect in society for self-determination and individual rights.

【20】 Four ethical principles in health care—autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice—reflect the important fundamental values in health care. No single principle can be identified as “superior” or more important than the others in all cases.

【21】 The principle of autonomy relies on the capacity to communicate and reason about choices. When a patient lacks decisional capacity, his or her autonomy is preserved through surrogate decision-makers speaking for the patient.

【22】 Ethics consultation is a function of health care ethics committees. Its aim is to provide a forum for ethical questions in a particular patient’s care to be raised, all viewpoints to be heard, options considered, and a consensus reached in determining next steps.焦瀚远
