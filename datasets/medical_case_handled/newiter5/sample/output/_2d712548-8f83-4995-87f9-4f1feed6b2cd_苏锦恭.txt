【1】### CASE 22

【2】A 48-year-old man complains of “numbness and stiffness” in his arms for the past 4 months. His gait has gradually deteriorated because of unsteadiness. On examination the patient appears older than his stated age. His hair is nearly completely gray. There is slight limitation of head movement to either side, but no pain with neck extension. His tongue is red and depilated. His gait is broad based, and he is unable to walk a straight line. He is able to stand with his feet together with his eyes open, but he nearly falls when his eyes are closed. He has normal arm coordination but is ataxic on the heel–knee–shin maneuver. Deep tendon reflexes (DTRs) are 3+ in the arms, 3+ at the knees, and absent at the ankles. Both plantar responses are extensor. The patient has a jaw jerk and a positive snout reflex. There is a stocking decrease in sensation and a marked decrease in vibration and joint position sense in the toes and ankles. Cranial nerves are normal, and there are mild problems with memory and calculation. T2-weighted MRI of the brain demonstrates extensive areas of high-intensity signal in the periventricular white matter. MRI of the spine shows a hyperintense signal along the posterior column of the spinal cord.

【6】### ANSWERS TO CASE 22: Subacute Combined Degeneration of the Spinal Cord

【7】Summary : This is a 48-year-old patient who complains of a progressive gait disorder characterized by sensory ataxia caused by impaired position sense and spasticity. His examination is significant for both peripheral and central nervous system involvement, primarily affecting the white matter fibers of the posterior columns of the spinal columns and pyramidal tracts and large myelinated peripheral nerve affecting coordination and muscle tone.

【8】• Most likely diagnosis : Vitamin B <sub class="calibre12">12 </sub> deficiency

【9】• Next diagnostic step : Vitamin B <sub class="calibre12">12 </sub> level and if positive, subsequent testing to determine the source of B <sub class="calibre12">12 </sub> malabsorption

【10】• Next step in therapy : Intramuscular vitamin B <sub class="calibre12">12 </sub> supplementation

【11】#### ANALYSIS

【12】##### Objectives

【13】1\. Understand the range of pathologic and clinical manifestations of vitamin B <sub class="calibre12">12 </sub> deficiency.

【14】2\. Know the differential diagnosis of vitamin B <sub class="calibre12">12 </sub> deficiency.

【15】3\. Understand the types of tests to confirm the diagnosis and etiology of vitamin B <sub class="calibre12">12 </sub> deficiency.

【16】4\. Be aware of the proper mode of repletion of vitamin B <sub class="calibre12">12 </sub> .

【17】##### Considerations

【18】The pertinent features of this case include the unsteadiness of gait, and numbness and stiffness. The physical examination helps localize the pathology. There is a stocking pattern decrease in sensation, specifically vibration and joint position sense, which strongly suggests a neuropathy involving large myelinated fibers. Involvement of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord, at or above the lumbar level is also a possibility. The pathologically increased reflexes in the arms along with the presence of primitive reflexes are “upper motor neuron signs” and suggest involvement of the corticospinal tract above the level of the cervical spinal cord. In this case, one would expect increased reflexes in the legs also, unless there is also a coexistent neuropathy. The ataxic heel–knee–shin maneuver also points to aberrant input to the cerebellum, which comes through large fibers. The mild problems on mental status examination indicate a cortical disorder. All of these findings suggest involvement at multiple levels of the nervous system. The imaging study confirms involvement of myelinated regions in the spinal cord, specifically the dorsal columns and in the brain. Assuming all these signs/symptoms are manifestations of a single entity, a systemic disease should be considered, such as HIV-1-associated vacuolar myelopathy, Lyme disease, multiple sclerosis, neurosyphilis, or vitamin B <sub class="calibre12">12 </sub> deficiency. Peripheral nerve disorders (neuropathic) would not be expected to give upper motor neuron signs. Another clue on physical diagnosis is the abnormal tongue and prematurely graying hair.

【19】#### DEFINITIONS

【20】BABINSKI SIGN/PRIMITIVE REFLEXES : Elicited reflex response present in newborns, which disappears with neurological development in association with progressive myelination of the nervous system. These “infantile” reflexes include the palmo-mental (contraction of ipsilateral chin mentalis muscle with stimulation of palm), snout (protrusion of lips with touching or tapping of lips), jaw jerk, and grasp reflex (closure of hand/fingers with placement of object in hand). The Babinski reflex is characterized by extensor response to the toe possibly in association with abduction of toes with stimulation of the sole or lateral side of the foot. It is present in infants and neonates and in association with disruption of the corticospinal tract of the brain and spinal cord.

【21】NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES : An electrodiagnostic study of peripheral nerve function (nerve signal velocity and amplitude) often in conjunction with electromyography, which is used to assess muscle function or dysfunction.

【22】### APPROACH TO: Subacute Combined Degeneration of the Spinal Cord

【23】Spinal cord diseases are common, and many are treatable if discovered early. The spinal cord is a tubular structure originating from the medulla of the brain and extending through the bony spine to end at the level of the upper lumbar vertebrae. Ascending sensory and descending motor white matter tracts are located peripherally; posterior columns govern joint position, vibration and pressure, lateral spinothalamic tracts pain and temperature, and ventral corticospinal tracts carry motor signals.

【24】#### VITAMIN B <sub class="calibre12">12 </sub> DEFICIENCY

【25】Vitamin B <sub class="calibre12">12 </sub> deficiency usually presents as paresthesias in the hands and feet and loss of vibratory sense. There is a diffuse effect on the spinal cord, primarily the posterior lateral columns, explaining the early loss of vibratory sense. Late in the course, optic atrophy and mental changes as well as ataxia can occur. Macrocytic anemia is common.

【26】Cyanocobalamin is a compound that is metabolized to a vitamin in the B complex commonly known as vitamin B <sub class="calibre12">12 </sub> . Vitamin B <sub class="calibre12">12 </sub> is the most chemically complex of all the vitamins. The structure of B <sub class="calibre12">12 </sub> is based on a corrin ring, which is similar to the porphyrin ring found in heme, chlorophyll, and cytochrome. The central metal ion is cobalt (Co). Once metabolized, cobalamin is a coenzyme in many biochemical reactions, including DNA synthesis, methionine synthesis from homocysteine, and conversion of propionyl into succinyl coenzyme A from methylmalonate. Dietary cobalamin (Cbl), obtained through animal foods, enters the stomach bound to animal proteins. Absorption requires many factors including stomach acid, R-protein, and intrinsic factor from gastric parietal cells, and the distal 80 cm of the ileum for transport. Interference in any of these points can lead to malabsorption of vitamin B <sub class="calibre12">12 </sub> . In addition, there are a number of inborn errors of metabolism that can both interfere with the absorption and action of vitamin B <sub class="calibre12">12 </sub> . The most common cause of vitamin B <sub class="calibre12">12 </sub> deficiency is malabsorption because of pernicious anemia, a condition where antibodies are generated to the parietal cells of the stomach, and the necessary binding proteins. There are many other causes, however, that should be considered.

【27】Pathologically, in subacute combined degeneration (SCD), there is edema and destruction of myelin. Thus, the clinical presentation of SCD is caused by dorsal column, lateral corticospinal tract, and sometimes lateral spinothalamic tract dysfunction. The initial symptoms are usually paresthesia in the hands and feet. This condition can progress to sensory loss, gait ataxia, and distal weakness, particularly in the legs. If the disease goes untreated, an ataxic paraplegia can evolve. Specific findings on examination are loss of vibratory and joint position sense, weakness, spasticity, hyperreflexia, and extensor plantar responses. The syndrome of sensory loss as well as spastic paresis associated with pathologic lesions in the dorsal columns and lateral corticospinal tracts is referred to as subacute combined degeneration . There are also effects on other body systems, most conspicuously hematologic with the macrocytic anemia.

【28】#### DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

【29】The manifestations of vitamin B <sub class="calibre12">12 </sub> deficiency are noted in Table 22–1 . The differential diagnosis for progressive spastic paraplegia includes degenerative causes, demyelinating, infectious, inflammatory, neoplastic, nutritional, and vascular disorders (HIV-1-associated vacuolar myelopathy, Lyme disease, multiple sclerosis neurosyphilis, toxic neuropathy, Friedreich ataxia, and vitamin E deficiency). The differential diagnosis of SCD is broad, but vitamin B <sub class="calibre12">12 </sub> deficiency should be considered in any patient with progressive sensory symptoms or weakness.

【30】#### LABORATORY CONFIRMATION

【31】Testing for vitamin B <sub class="calibre12">12 </sub> deficiency includes a direct assay of the vitamin as well as looking at the indirect effect of abnormal reactions resulting in altered metabolite levels. The definitions of Cbl (vitamin B <sub class="calibre12">12 </sub> ) deficiency are as follows: Serum Cbl level <150 pmol/L on two separate occasions OR serum Cbl level < 150 pmol/L AND total serum homocysteine level >13 µmol/L OR methylmalonic acid (MMA) > 0.4 µmol/L (in the absence of renal failure and folate and vitamin B <sub class="calibre12">6 </sub> deficiencies). The hemato-logic manifestations of vitamin B <sub class="calibre12">12 </sub> deficiency can be mimicked by folate deficiency, but this does not mimic the neurologic manifestations. High MMA levels and normal B <sub class="calibre12">12 </sub> levels indicate a functional deficiency likely due to abnormal cofactors needed for B <sub class="calibre12">12 </sub> action. In addition, the multiple organ systems and subsystems affected are highly variable from patient to patient.

【32】Confirmatory effects of the anatomic and physiologic consequences of B <sub class="calibre12">12 </sub> deficiency involve nerve conduction studies and MRI. Few reported cases of MR imaging of SCD exist. Findings in these cases include modest expansion of the cervical and thoracic spinal cord and increased signal intensity on T2-weighted images, primarily in the dorsal columns and lateral pyramidal tracts.

【33】#### TREATMENT

【34】Treatment of vitamin B <sub class="calibre12">12 </sub> deficiency involves administering the vitamin in a fashion to bypass the pathologic steps in the transport process. This usually involves intramuscular administration of the vitamin, first to build up stores and then on a monthly basis. Specifically, 1000 µg/d for 1 week, then 1000 µg/wk for 1 month. Then 1000 µg/mo until the cause of deficiency is corrected, or for life in the case of pernicious anemia. This is effective for all forms of the deficiency. There are also methods of oral administration that are sometimes effective. Treatment can reverse or stop most if not all of the sequelae of vitamin B <sub class="calibre12">12 </sub> deficiency.
