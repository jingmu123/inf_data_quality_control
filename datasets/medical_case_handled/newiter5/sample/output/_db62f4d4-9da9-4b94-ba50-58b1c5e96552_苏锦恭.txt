【1】skin and soft tissue infections related to trauma (lacerations， cuts， and puncture wounds). These infections reflected increases in the number of usual infections typically present in our environment， and not exotic diseases.

【2】The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has noted that widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases after hurricanes are not common in the United States 通用删除6(英):<u>\[1\]</u>. Rare and deadly exotic diseases， such as cholera or typhoid， do not suddenly break out after hurricanes and floods in areas where such diseases do not naturally occur \[I\]. This prediction was borne out by the actual infectious diseases reported from the Gulf Coast after Hurricane Katrina 通用删除6(英):<u>\[2\]</u>.

【3】Communicable disease outbreaks of diarrhea and respiratory illness can occur when water and sewage systems are not working and personal hygiene is hard to maintain as a result of a disaster. In the report noted in Table 12.1c， dermato-logic conditions and diarrheal diseases were commonly reported， including insect bites but not respiratory diseases. Because cholera and typhoid are not commonly found in the Gulf States area， it was very unlikely that they would occur after Hurricane Katrina. There was in fact no outbreak of these illnesses. Twenty-four cases of Vibrio illnesses were reported to the CDC， with six deaths 通用删除6(英):<u>\[2\]</u>. A break-down of the cases of Vibrio illnesses seen in Louisiana and Mississippi between8/29 and 9/11/05 is illustrated in the MMWR publication of September 23， 2005， and in Fig. 12.5a 通用删除6(英):<u>\[3\]</u>.

【4】Clinical and laboratory characteristics of Vibrio cellulitis and sepsis

【5】Wound infection with Vibrio is typically evidenced by a rapid-onset cellulitis (1-2days)， following skin break or injury， leading to necrotizing fasciitis. Extreme pain at the involved limb and systemic illness， including shock， can occur. The skin may show peculiar blisters (often hemorrhagic) in association with the cel-lulitis， as was noted in patients 5 (case #12.2) and 6 (case #12.1) reported here删除25：<u></u>. Blood cultures are also rapidly positive (1-2 days) in seriously ill patients， while other site cultures are also positive， usually within 1-2 days. Rapid death is typical with overwhelming sepsis in those with severe underlying diseases (severe liver disease or other immunosuppression) 删除25：<u></u>.

【6】Serious infections with Vibrio organisms lead to prolonged hospitalization in those who survive， especially with V. vulnificus (patients 5 and 6 spent 22 and41 days， respectively， in the hospital). Multiple surgical debridement， appropriate antibiotics， skin grafting， and， on occasion， HBO therapy may be required (as in patients 1，5， and 6). Those with severe underlying disease arriving in septic shock(e.g. as in patients 3 and 4) have a rapid demise.

【7】Successful treatment requires a combination of antibiotics， surgery， and sep-sis/shock management that should be initiated early in the illness.

【8】Table 12.1c Number of cases of selected diseases and conditions reported in evacuees and rescue workers during the 3 weeks immediately after Hurricane Katrina made landfall- multiple states， August-September 2005.

【16】Vibrio infections peak in the warm summer months， as was the case when Hurricane Katrina occurred on 8/29/05.

【17】Isolated Vibrio organisms seen in human disease in our hospital over the past18 years have usually been found to be very sensitive to multiple antimicro-bial agents. The third-generation cephalosporins， quinolones， tetracyclines， and other classes are effective clinically and in in vitro susceptibility tests. On occa-sion， ampicillin may be resistant. Patients die usually not because of antimicrobial resistance but for other reasons (overwhelming sepsis or immunosuppression). The most virulent Vibrio， V. vulnificus， has been found to be equally sensitive to the usually available antimicrobial agents.

【18】Most Vibrio species have the following characteristics： they are gram negative， facultatively anaerobic， straight， curved， or comma-shaped rods that are catalase and oxidase positive 通用删除6(英):<u>\[4\]</u>. The typical Vibrio organism shows a rapid growth (1-2days) on blood agar plate， or special media， thiosulfate-citrate-bile salts-sucrose(TCBS)， and is motile. Other related water-borne gram-negative organisms(Aeromonas， Plesiomonas， and Enterobacteriaceae) may be differentiated by their degree of sodium (salt) requirement for growth or stimulation， sensitivity to the vibriostatic compound (O/129)， substrate fermentation， and growth on TCBS通用删除6(英):<u>\[4\]</u>.

【19】Addendum

【20】A few cases of unusual or unexplained pruritic dermopathy， along with neu-ropsychiatric complaints， were also seen post Hurricane Katrina. The CDC set up a task force in 2006 to investigate the increased number of inquiries received regarding this unexplained cutaneous condition (crawling， biting， stinging， and other vague complaints). In addition to skin manifestations， some sufferers also reported fatigue， mental confusion， short-term memory loss， joint pain， and changes in vision. These symptoms were clinically not true soft tissue infections.

【21】The results of the comprehensive CDC study of unexplained apparent der-mopathy have been published 通用删除6(英):<u>\[5，6\]</u>. These studies demonstrated no evidence for an infectious cause of this syndrome， and no evidence of an environmental link. Although the cause of this syndrome is unknown， a common viewpoint of medical professionals， including most dermatologists， is that the symptoms are most compatible with "delusional parasitosis."Another name associated with this disorder is "Morgellons."

【22】Additional comments on disaster conditions (hurricane， unsanitarylrefugee camp)

【23】· The most common infectious diseases are those already present in the envi-ronment before the event.

【24】· Such diseases may be magnified under those conditions (skin abscesses， scabies or mite infestations， diarrhea， and respiratory diseases).

【25】· Exotic diseases are unusual， unless specifically introduced into the environ-ment or camp 删除10：<u>(as happened in Haiti with cholera， following the earthquake of January， 2010)</u> 通用删除6(英):<u>\[7\]</u>.

【26】Unsanitary conditions， overcrowding， and lack of a clean or adequate water supply facilitate transmission of many communicable or contagious diseases.苏锦恭
