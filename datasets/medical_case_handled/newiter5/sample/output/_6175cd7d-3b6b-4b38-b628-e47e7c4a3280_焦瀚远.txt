【0】CASE 12: EXCESSIVE HAIR GROWTH AND 

【1】INFERTILITY 

【2】A 22-year-old woman presents to her GP because she is embarrassed by ‘excessive hair growth’  删除换行1 on her upper lip, lower abdomen and thighs. She has waxed her legs and body and shaved  删除换行1 her upper lip weekly throughout her teenage years. On direct questioning, she reports that  删除换行1 her periods have been irregular since menarche and that she is having difficulty conceiving  删除换行1 despite regular unprotected sexual intercourse with her partner for the past year. Her family  删除换行1 history is significant for diabetes and hypertension in her mother and maternal grandfather.
Examination 

【3】Physical examination reveals a mildly obese woman (body mass index [BMI] 31) with moderate facial acne and confirms hirsutism (Ferriman-Gallwey score 15). Examination of the  删除换行1 genitalia is unremarkable, with a patent outflow tract and no clitoromegaly. Bimanual examination reveals a mobile anteverted uterus.
INVESTIGATIONS 

【4】• FBC, renal profile: Normal 

【5】• Urine β-hCG: Negative 

【6】QUESTIONS 

【7】1. Suggest a differential diagnosis for the cause of this woman’s hirsutism.
2. Based on the clinical picture, what is the most likely diagnosis and why? What do  删除换行1 you know about the aetiology of this condition?
3. What further investigations would be useful to confirm the likely diagnosis?
4. What are the management options in treating this woman’s symptoms and overall condition?
5. Are there longer-term health problems that need to be considered in this  删除换行1 patient?

ANSWERS

【8】Medically, hirsutism refers to excessive terminal hair growth in a male pattern in women. Up  删除换行1 to 5% of women of reproductive age are hirsute, according to the Ferriman-Gallwey scale 

【9】(which scores hair growth in the most androgen-dependent parts of the body, with a score >7  删除换行1 defined as hirsute). As sexual hair growth is entirely androgen-dependent, androgen levels  删除换行1 and the sensitivity of hair follicles to androgens are the primary factors leading to hirsutism.
However, women with milder hirsutism may not show elevated androgen levels and have  删除换行1 what is known as idiopathic hirsutism, which accounts for around 50% of cases. The remainder of cases are associated with hyperandrogenism, the causes of which are 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> polycystic  删除换行1 ovarian syndrome (PCOS), 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> adrenogenital syndromes (e.g. non-classic congenital adrenal  删除换行1 hyperplasia), 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> androgen-secreting tumours, 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> other causes of hormone overproduction  删除换行1 such as Cushing’s syndrome and 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> drug-induced.
In this woman, the main presenting complaints of hirsutism and difficulty conceiving, with  删除换行1 probable anovulation, are consistent with a diagnosis of PCOS. PCOS affects up to 10%  删除换行1 of women of reproductive age and is the underlying factor in around 15–20% of infertility  删除换行1 cases. A diagnosis of PCOS, according to the 2003 Rotterdam PCOS Consensus Group,  删除换行1 can be made with two of the following three findings: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> clinical or biochemical evidence of  删除换行1 androgen excess, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> oligovulation or anovulation and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> polycystic ovaries on ultrasound.
The clinical findings in this case are sufficient to meet the first two of these, allowing a putative diagnosis of PCOS to be made.
While the exact pathophysiology of PCOS is unclear, one theory suggests that increased  删除换行1 gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) pulsing leads to increased luteinising hormone 

【10】(LH) pulsing, stimulating increased production of androgens by theca cells in the ovary.
There is also evidence that women with PCOS have elevated levels of insulin, which is known  删除换行1 to act synergistically with LH to enhance androgen production by theca cells. Further, insulin inhibits synthesis of sex hormone–binding globulin (SHBG) by the liver, thereby increasing the proportion of free testosterone in the blood. These effects of insulin account for the  删除换行1 hyperandrogenaemia in PCOS, which disrupts the normal follicular development process,  删除换行1 leading to anovulation.
Before a diagnosis of PCOS can confidently be made, other conditions that produce hyperandrogenism and irregular menstrual cycles need to be excluded. Further investigations that  删除换行1 may be performed to look for other causes include: 

【11】•	 Thyroid function (hypothyroidism)
•	 Serum prolactin (hyperprolactinaemia)
•	 24-hour urinary cortisol (Cushing’s syndrome)
•	 Morning 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels (elevated in non-classic congenital adrenal  删除换行1 hyperplasia)
•	 Oral glucose tolerance test and growth hormone suppression (acromegaly)
•	 Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and oestradiol (high and low/normal, respectively, in premature ovarian failure)
Biochemical investigations may show increased testosterone levels, reduced SHBG, increased 

【12】LH and a high LH:FSH ratio. An ovarian ultrasound should be performed to visualise the  删除换行1 ovaries.
Management of PCOS is essentially symptomatic. Hirsutism and acne are managed by agents  删除换行1 designed to inhibit hyperandrogenism, such as the combined oral contraceptive pill, antiandrogens (such as cyproterone acetate or spironolactone), and eflornithine hydrochloride, Case 12: Excessive Hair Growth and Infertility 33  删除换行1 as well as laser or electrolysis for hair removal. The presence of chronic anovulation carries  删除换行1 a higher risk of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma, and therefore requires treatment  删除换行1 (typically with the contraceptive pill or cyclical progestogens). Ovulation may be induced  删除换行1 with the use of clomiphene (an oestrogen receptor antagonist at the hypothalamus).PCOS also carries a significant risk for the development of metabolic and cardiovascular disease, including obesity, impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes and accelerated atherosclerosis. The likely pathophysiology behind these is insulin resistance, since women with PCOS  删除换行5 are usually hyperinsulinaemic. These longer-term complications require similar management to type 2 diabetes, with weight reduction and certain antidiabetic agents (metformin  删除换行1 and the thiazolidinediones) forming the mainstay of treatment.
KEY POINTS 

【13】• Hirsutism refers to the excessive growth of hair in a male pattern in women.
• It may arise from elevated androgen levels or be idiopathic.
• PCOS is a clinical diagnosis that often presents with hirsutism and oligomenorrhea  删除换行1 or amenorrhoea.
• The mechanism of hyperandrogenism in PCOS is unclear but may relate to  删除换行1 increased GnRH and LH pulsing.焦瀚远
