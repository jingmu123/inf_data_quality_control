【0】8.11 A 63-year-old man with a known history of lung cancer complains of progres-sive weakness. You perform a thorough history and physical examination of the patient and order additional ancillary studies. Based upon your findings， you diagnose him with Eaton-Lambert syndrome， an autoimmune disease which causes destruction of the presynaptic voltage-gated Ca+ channels. Which of the following events involved in normal neurotransmission would most likely be disrupted by the destruction of these channels?

【1】A. Propagation of an action potential to the presynaptic terminal

【2】B. Release of neurotransmitter in response to nerve terminal depolarization

【3】C.Response of the postsynaptic cell to neurotransmitter

【4】D.Removal of neurotransmitter from the synaptic cleft

【5】8.2 A 27-year-old man is brought into the emergency room with complaints of severe nausea and vomiting as well as diplopia and weakness. His friend reports he cans his own vegetables and had eaten some the previous evening. Your initial suspicion is that this man has botulism， and you immediately administer botulinum antitoxin. Which of the following processes involved in neurotrans mission is inhibited by botulinum toxin?

【6】A1.1Anterograde axonal transport which delivers neurotransmitter precursors to the synaptic terminal

【7】B. Synthesis of neurotransmitter in the presynaptic terminal

【8】C.IPackaging of neurotransmitter into synaptic vesicles

【9】D.Fusion of the synaptic vesicles with the neuronal membrane， resulting in neurotransmitter release

【10】8.3Which of following best describes the kiss-and-run model of synaptic vesicle recovery!

【11】A.Synaptic vesicles completely fuse with the presynaptic membrane， releas-ing their contents into the synaptic cleft. The vesicle components are then recovered by clathrin-mediated endocytosis.

【12】B. Synaptic vesicles completely fuse with the presynaptic membrane， releas- ing their contents into the synaptic cleft. The vesicle components are then recovered by endocytosis without clathrin-coated pits.

【13】Synaptic vesicles approach the presynaptic membrane but do not com-pletely fuse with it. They open pores with the membrane， releasing their contents into the synaptic cleft， and then separate from the membrane intact.

【14】D删除38：<u>)</u>.Synaptic vesicles fuse with the presynaptic membrane， releasing their con-tents into the synaptic cleft. The vesicle components are not recovered， but rather new components are synthesized in the soma and transported to the presynaptic terminal.
ANSWERS

【15】8.1 B. BecauseEaton-Lambert syndrome is a disorder that stems from destruction of the presynaptic calcium channels， it follows that those steps in neurotransmis-sion that directly involve calcium channels， specifically release of neurotrans-mitter in response to nerve terminal depolarization， would be disrupted. Recall that opening of voltage-gated calcium channels results in calcium influx， which results in fusion of secretory vesicles with the presynaptic membrane and release of neurotransmitter into the cleft. Action potentials depend on sodium and potassium channels， so destruction of calcium channels will not prevent them. In Eaton-Lambert syndrome， there is a deficient response of the postsyn aptic cell， but this is not caused by a disruption in response to neurotransmitter. Rather， it is because there is insufficient neurotransmitter released. The ability of the postsynaptic cell to respond remains intact； there is simply nothing to respond to. Removal of neurotransmitter from the synaptic cleft is unaffected by the loss of calcium channels.

【16】8.2 D. Botulinum toxin binds to and inactivates the acetylcholine synaptic vesicle docking complex， which normally facilitates the fusion of the synaptic vesi-cles with the neuronal membrane， allowing neurotransmitter release. This prevents fusion of the vesicle with the presynaptic membrane and release into the synaptic cleft. The other steps listed in the question are not inhibited by botulinum toxin. Packaging of norepinephrine into vesicles is inhibited by the drug reserpine.

【17】8.3 C. Answer C accurately describes the kiss-and-run pathway. Answers A and B describe the classical pathway for vesicle recycling and the bulk endocy-tosis pathways， respectively. Answer D is not a described method for vesicle recycling.

【18】NEUROSCIENCE PEARLS

【19】 Botulinum toxin is an exotoxin secreted by Clostridium botulinum， and has a protease effect， cleaving integral membrane proteins of the acetylcholine-containing presynaptic vesicles.

【20】The decreased levels of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction produce the weakness that is the hallmark of botulism poisoning.

【21】Ca²+ (the influx of which is triggered by membrane depolarization) is nec-essary for the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the neuronal membrane and the release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft.

【22】The amount of neurotransmitter released is directly proportional to the influx of Ca+ ions.

【23】Synaptic vesicles in the cytosol are anchored in place to cytoskeletal filaments by proteins called synapsins.

【24】TThe three known pathways by which synaptic membranes are retrieved are the classical pathway， the kiss-and-run pathway， and the bulk endo-cytosis pathway.

【25】The classical pathway describes retrieval by endocytosis of the synaptic membrane by means of clathrin-coated pits.

【26】TThe kiss-and-run pathway states that instead of the vesicle completely fusing with the presynaptic membrane， the vesicle’s fusion pore opens to release the neurotransmitter and then closes so the vesicle can be recycled.

【27】The bulk endocytosis pathway describes retrieval of excess membrane without the use of clathrin-coated pits.焦瀚远
