【11】Case Presentation
-----------------

【12】This is a 33-year-old woman with a history of acromegaly treated with transsphenoidal surgery and radiation therapy and receiving medical therapy to control growth hormone excess who wishes to conceive. At age 30, she developed right visual loss and was found to have bilateral visual field defects and a pituitary macroadenoma 删除33：<u></u>. She had also noted an increase in hand and foot size, difficulty biting down because of malocclusion of her jaw, headaches, sweating, and snoring. She had heavy menstrual cycles that were irregular and treated with birth control pills for several years.

【13】Magnetic resonance imaging of three pituitary glands of a person with pituitary tumorspituitary macroadenoma. The first image is a preoperative image, the second image is 6 weeks post-operation, and the third image is 2 years post-operation. The pituitary gland is evident in the first image being shaded slightly brighter than the rest of the brain.

( a ) Preoperative baseline imaging: MRI shows large pituitary macroadenoma with extension to the left cavernous sinus, mass effect on the adjacent optic nerve/chiasm/tracts, anterior mesial left temporal lobe, and inferior left frontal lobe. Foci of the T2 hypointensity and susceptibility effect within the lesion consistent with blood products. ( b ) Six weeks postoperative imaging: Evolving post-surgical findings of interval transsphenoidal surgery for partial resection of sellar mass with residual hypoenhancing lesion in left sellar encasing the left cavernous internal carotid artery. ( c ) Two years post-radiation imaging: Interval decrease in size of enhancing soft tissue in the left aspect of the sella extending into the left cavernous sinus and floor of the left middle cranial fossa. The mass continues to encase the left cavernous internal carotid artery</u>

【16】On exam she had facial changes consistent with acromegaly including broadening of her nose, widening of her forehead, thickening of her lips, coarsening of her facial features, spaces between her teeth, macroglossia, thickening of her fingers, and doughy hands. She had multiple skin tags on her face and her back. Laboratory studies indicated an insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) level of 900 ng/ml (normal, 53–351), random growth hormone (GH) level of 56 ng/ml (normal <7), and prolactin level of 57 ng/ml (normal, 0.1–23.3). Her other hormonal function testing before surgery showed a normal free T4, normal TSH, and a normal cosyntropin stimulation test. Hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis could not be assessed reliably given that she was on birth control pills.

【17】She underwent transsphenoidal surgery. Pathology revealed a sparsely granulated somatotroph adenoma, with an elevated KI-67 proliferation index of 4%. Six weeks postoperatively, her MRI showed partial resection of the large macroadenoma with residual lesion in the left cavernous sinus 删除33：<u></u>. Three months postoperatively, mild central hypothyroidism developed, and IGF-1 level improved but remained elevated . The IGF-1 level failed to normalize on a maximal dose of first-generation somatostatin analog (lanreotide 120 mg per month). Pegvisomant was added. On the combination of lanreotide 120 mg per month and pegvisomant 30 mg per day, she achieved biochemical control with normalization of the IGF-1 level at 237 ng/ml 通用删除7(英):<u>(53–331)</u> while taking on oral contraceptive, as she was advised to avoid pregnancy while receiving medical therapies for acromegaly. However, she wanted to conceive as soon as it would be safe to do so. Given the high KI-67, suggestive of possible aggressive tumor behavior and the significant residual tumor, radiation therapy was administered.

【21】Anterior pituitary hormone tests remained normal 6 and 12 months after radiation. However, 2 years post radiation, and off birth control pills for more than 8 weeks, she had no menstrual periods and developed severe fatigue. She was found to have hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, mild hyperprolactinemia, and adrenal insufficiency . She was treated with oral hydrocortisone 10 mg in the morning and 5 mg in the afternoon daily with improvement of symptoms. Pituitary imaging revealed ongoing resolution of tumor 删除33：<u></u>. Medical therapy (pegvisomant and the long-acting lanreotide) for acromegaly was discontinued in preparation for ovulation induction. In this setting, headaches recurred, and IGF-1 rose into the 500 ng/mL range. She was switched to cabergoline 2 mg per week with the goal of decreasing both the IGF-1 and prolactin levels. In addition, subcutaneous octreotide, short-acting, was administered at a low dose to control her headaches and stopped 3 days before ovulation induction. IGF-1 was minimally elevated, just slightly above the normal range, before ovulation induction with human menopausal gonadotropins (HMG) was begun. A low dose and slow regimen of HMG was started. Two cycles were aborted due to multiple follicles. On the third cycle, a singleton pregnancy was achieved with low-dose HMG for ovulation induction, along with intrauterine insemination following hCG trigger of oocyte release.

【22】Cabergoline was stopped at conception. Thyroid replacement was increased by two pills per week, 28.6% in anticipation of increased needs of pregnancy. The free T4 level was planned for 1 month. Current dose of hydrocortisone was maintained, with suggested close monitoring of blood pressure and clinical follow-up planned. Monitoring for gestational diabetes and maternal fetal consult was suggested. Visual field testing every trimester was advised. Stress dose steroids were advised during active labor and at delivery.

【23】Pathophysiology of Infertility in Patients with Pituitary Tumors
----------------------------------------------------------------

【24】### Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Gonadal (HPG) Axis

【25】Pulsatile-luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion are required for ovulatory function 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 1 \]</u>. Hypothalamic amenorrhea due to functional causes disrupts the secretion of GnRH resulting in low LH and FSH and may be associated with endogenous hypercortisolemia and low serum T4 and T3 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 2 \]</u>. Pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) may restore ovulatory function and fertility in the setting of congenital isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism due to GnRH deficiency and in hypothalamic amenorrhea due to functional disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 1 , 2 \]</u>. In the setting of pituitary lesions, pituitary surgery and/or pituitary radiation, the absence of, disruption of, or decrease in LH and FSH cause anovulation, which may be reversed with exogenous administration of gonadotropins 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 3 \]</u>. Women with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism have been found to have higher anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels than women with male factor or tubal causes of infertility 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 4 \]</u> or compared to normal controls 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 5 \]</u>. A hypothesis is that higher AMH may be due to multiple antral follicles too small in size to be detectable by ultrasound 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 5 \]</u>.

【26】### Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Growth Hormone (HPGH) Axis

【27】The ovary has GH and IGF-1 receptors. IGF-1 may augment LH and FSH signaling in granulosa cells. However, a direct GH involvement in follicular maturation is shown in GH receptor/growth hormone-binding protein (GHBP) mice knockouts which have a lower rate of ovulation, are threefold less responsive to gonadotropin treatment than the wild type, and cannot be rescued with IGF-1, suggesting that the GH effects on follicular growth are independent of IGF-1 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 6 \]</u>. GHI is thought to have a beneficial effect on oocyte quality and possibly on endometrial receptivity when given during ovarian stimulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 7 \]</u> with improvement in pregnancy rate and a trend toward a higher but not statistically significant improvement in live birth rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 8 \]</u>. However, studies of GH replacement in women with hypopituitarism are limited. On the other hand, GH excess has detrimental effects on fertility. Polycystic ovarian syndrome morphology has been reported as a consequence of exogenous GH therapy in women with hypopituitarism and those with isolated GH deficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 9 \]</u>. Endogenous GH excess due to growth hormone-secreting tumors can also be associated with polycystic ovarian syndrome morphology and infertility 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 10 \]</u>. Acromegaly, as in the clinical case described here, may cause infertility by four different mechanisms: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> high prolactin, either due to co-secretion with growth hormone or stalk effect, which inhibits GnRH, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> gonadotropin deficiency due to tumor mass, 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> gonadotropin deficiency due to surgery or radiation, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> GH and IGF-1 itself causing a polycystic ovarian syndrome-like state 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 10 \]</u>.

【28】### Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis

【29】There are many interactions between the HPA and the HPG axis which are relevant when considering fertility in a patient with central adrenal insufficiency. Excessive amounts of endogenous or exogenous glucocorticoids (GC) inhibit LH secretion, thereby reducing estrogen and progesterone, and GC may cause endometrial resistance to gonadal steroids 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 11 \]</u>. While primary adrenal insufficiency has been associated with decreased parity, the mechanism for the lower birth rates in women with adrenal insufficiency is not known 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 12 , 13 \]</u>. Low adrenal androgens and/or GC over replacement could be responsible 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 12 , 13 \]</u>, and both are theoretically applicable to patients with hypopituitarism and central adrenal insufficiency. However, these studies have been limited to women with primary adrenal insufficiency. During estrogen treatment in preparation for ovulation induction or during a stimulated cycle of ovulation induction, high estrogen levels will increase cortisol-binding globulin (CBG), resulting in higher serum cortisol levels, an effect that must be considered in interpreting results in this setting 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 14 \]</u>.

【30】### Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Thyroid Axis

【31】Normal fetal development requires thyroid hormone. Primary hypothyroidism during pregnancy is associated with adverse outcomes. While trimester-specific thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels have been identified for women with intact thyroid function, TSH measurement is not useful for women with central hypothyroidism. There is limited information regarding the diagnosis of central hypothyroidism during pregnancy. Low free T4 levels in the setting of low or inappropriately normal TSH would typically be diagnostic of central hypothyroidism but may be difficult to interpret during pregnancy. Free T4 by dialysis may be more reliable than other free T4 assays during pregnancy. A low total T4 would be indicative of central hypothyroidism in early pregnancy, or during a stimulated cycle with a high estradiol level, given the expected increase in total T4 due to estrogen-stimulated increase in thyroid-binding globulin (TBG). Therefore, a low total T4 likely reflects central hypothyroidism in patients with known pituitary disorders after conception.

【32】It is known that hCG stimulates the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormones, such that in women with intact thyroid function, free T4 concentrations rise and TSH decreases beginning at 6 weeks of gestation 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 15 \]</u>. The normal cutoffs for free thyroid hormone levels are not well defined, and the expected pattern of thyroid levels for women with impaired hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroidal axis during pregnancy is unclear. It is conceivable that women with borderline or mild central hypothyroidism may respond to HCG stimulation with sufficient production of thyroid hormone if the thyroid gland itself remains intact. There are no randomized prospective trials evaluating thyroid hormone replacement preconception in patients with pituitary dysfunction, known or suspected to have central hypothyroidism. However, it is reasonable to consider some of the same principles used in women without pituitary disease, including assessment of thyroid peroxidase antibodies if TSH is high or borderline high, adding iodine (150 ug per day) to avoid deficiency, and following thyroid levels at regular intervals’ preconception and during pregnancy. For women at risk for central hypothyroidism in whom the diagnosis is not confirmed, the proposed protocol of thyroid testing every 3 months of preconception and each month during pregnancy starting at 6–8 weeks is not unreasonable 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 15 \]</u>.

【33】### Posterior Pituitary/Diabetes Insipidus (DI)

【34】Arginine vasopressin has an important role in the LH surge 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 16 \]</u> and in the activation of kisspeptin neurons 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 17 \]</u> in mice. However, women with DI may have normal ovulatory function. Oxytocin deficiency is not associated with reproductive dysfunction in mice 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 18 \]</u> or women. In women with hypopituitarism who have previously untreated adrenal insufficiency and diabetes insipidus, GC replacement may unmask subclinical DI. This is relevant for any patient who has a risk of hypopituitarism who has begun on steroid replacement including but not limited to women with pituitary disorders who present preconception .黄艳玲
