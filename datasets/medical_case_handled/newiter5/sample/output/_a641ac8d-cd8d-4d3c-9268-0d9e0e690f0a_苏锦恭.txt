【0】CASE 10

【1】A mother brings her 3-year-old daughter to the pediatrician. The mother reports that her daughter has gradually stopped speaking and is doing “weird" things with her hands. The mother states that although she was a normal baby and toddler， she has lost interest in her toys and looks at her family less. She does not speak at all and has screaming spells for hours during the day. Over time she has become unable to feed herself and constantly wrings her hands. Physical examination reveals decelerated head growth and stereotypic hand wringing.

【2】What is the most likely diagnosis?

【3】Rett disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by initial normal development during the first 6-18 months of life followed by a loss of speech and loss of purposeful hand movements.

【4】What are the genetics of this condition?

【5】Rett disorder is an X-linked disorder affecting only females. Affected males die in utero. The disorder is caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene， which encodes for a methyl-binding protein. This protein is most abundant in the brain and is thought to act as a gene suppressor during development.

【6】What is the progression of this condition over time?

【7】The course of this disorder is divided into stages：

【8】SStage 1 (6-18 months)： Subtle delays in gross motor skills， less eye contact， and reduced interest in play. SStage 2 (1-4 years)： Rapid loss of purposeful hand movements and loss of speech. Patients begin to display characteristic hand movements (wringing， tapping， clapping). Breathing abnormalities are common with periods of apnea and hyperventilation.

【9】SStage 3 (2-10 years)： Ataxia， motor problems， and seizures.

【10】SStage 4： The final stage， marked by reduced mobility， curvature of the spine (scoliosis)， and muscle rigidity.

【11】What is the treatment and prognosis for patients with this condition?

【12】Treatment for Rett disorder is aimed at alleviating symptoms with careful management of nutrition， pharmacotherapy for seizures， speech therapy for language dysfunction， and physical therapy for motor dysfunction. Patients can generally live for decades with successful management of symptoms.苏锦恭
