【0】Case 10

【1】A 52-year-old man has had progressive knee pain with swelling， and a Baker cyst just behind his right knee. Recently， the pain has increased in intensity， and has kept him from sleeping at night. His orthopedic surgeon has tentatively diagnosed a torn meniscus， and recommended an arthroscopy as an outpatient. The patient has had no major illnesses other than the typical childhood diseases. He has had no previous oper-ations or anesthetics， nor a family history of problems with anesthesia. He has no allergies to medications， does not smoke， and consumes alco-hol occasionally at social events. His laboratory results and physical examination by an internist were all normal. He has had nothing to eat or drink since he went to bed last night. On examination， the patient weighs 160 lb and is 5 ft， 8 in tall. His neck appears to be supple and mobile. He opens his mouth without difficulty， and with his head extended and tongue protruding， his uvula is completely visible.

【5】ANSWERS TO CASE 10：

【6】Anesthesia for the “Healthy” Patient

【7】Summary： A 52-year-old healthy patient with persistent and increasing knee pain is scheduled for an outpatient arthroscopy. His uvula is completely visible.

【8】\> A patient's ASA Physical Status Classification， noted as ASA I-I， cate-gorizes patients according to their comorbidities. The Mallampati airway classification describes the amount of a patient's uvula visible when a patient extends his neck and protrudes his tongue， and is one predictor of the risk of difficult airway management.

【9】PPatients are most vulnerable in Stage II of anesthesia， since they are hyperexcitable to external stimuli， and have lost both their airway reflexes and autonomic stability.

【10】\> An anesthetic evaluation prior to surgery should include the patient's history regarding their response to previous anesthetics， NPO status， pres-ence or absence of gastric reflux， difficulty or ease of airway management， history or family history of malignant hyperthermia or pseudocholinesterase deficiency， an examination of the oral cavity， airway and neck mobility， and the ease of i.v. access.

【28】has no medical comorbidities， he is classified as an “ASA Class 1." He has not had anything to eat or drink since midnight， so he can be considered as“NPO.”The potential ease or difficulty of intubation is often addressed using the Mallampati airway classification. In this particular patient， the uvula is completely visible when the patient's head is extended and his tongue pro-truded 删除25：<u>通用删除1(英):<u>(Please see Table 10-2)</u></u>. Thus， this patient is anticipated to pose lit-tle or no difficulty with airway management and his airway is classed as Mallampati Class 1. Since he is undergoing a quick procedure such as an arthroscopy， a general anesthetic would provide the fastest recovery with few complications.

【29】APPROACH TO

【30】The“Healthy”Patient： ASA I， Mallampati Class l

【31】DEFINITIONS

【32】AIRWAY PROTECTION： The ability to prevent the aspiration of gastric con-tents into the lungs which could cause pneumonia.

【33】ASA PHYSICAL STATUS CLASSIFICATION： Addresses the extent of a patient's medical comorbidities prior to surgery as ASA I to IV. Comorbidities are often associated with an increase in postoperative complications. Both comorbidi-ties and complications influence the likelihood that this ambulatory patient could be discharged on the day of surgery， versus needing to remain in the hos-pital. For an emergency case， an “E" is added. The ASA classifications are also commonly used by other specialties. 删除25：<u>通用删除1(英):<u>(Please see Table 10-3.)</u></u>

【34】DEPTH OF ANESTHESIA： The level of a patient's progression from con sciousness to unconsciousness following the administration of anesthesia. Depth is indicated by the stages of anesthesia. 删除25：<u>通用删除1(英):<u>(Please see Table 10-4.)</u></u>

【35】MALLAMPATI CLASSIFICATION： One of the factors predicting the difficulty of airway management and the placement of an endotracheal tube.

【38】CLINICAL APPROACH

【39】The preparation for any surgicalprocedure includes an history， a physical exami-nation， and laboratory tests which are appropriate when considering the patient's age， medical problems， and the type ofprocedure. In addition to the typical presurgical“work up，”an anesthetic evaluation is also important prior to the administration of anesthesia-whether general， regional anesthesia， or monitored anesthesia care (local infiltration with monitoring and sedation by an anesthesia provider). The pre-anesthesia evaluation addresses factors such as the patient's NPO status， the presence or absence of gastric reflux， his or her response to previous anesthetics， a reconciliation of medications taken on the day of surgery， and any pertinent family history including direct queries regarding malignant hyperthermia

【41】or pseudocholinesterase deficiency. In addition to the routine history and physi-cal， this information is necessary to allow the formulation of a safe and effective anesthetic plan. (Please also see the chapter on preoperative evaluation).

【42】Additional items on the physical examination include a careful evaluation of the patient's airway anatomy and neck mobility， and the ease of i.v. access. In particular， the airway examination， including the “fingers breadth” of mouth opening， hyomental distance， and Mallampati classification， provide informa-tion regarding the potential difficulty or ease of intubation. The patient’s NPO status， and presence or absence of gastric reflux or of a syndrome that signifi-cantly increases gastric volume may signal the need for a rapid sequence induc-tion 删除25：<u>(Please see Case 11)</u>， and similarly influences the anesthetic plan.

【43】The anesthetic plan should allow for a rapid return of mental function， and especially in the case of outpatients， recovery of psychomotor skills prior to . discharge， as well as to minimize complications. Patients must be able to walk(if they could walk prior to the procedure)， be medically stable， and free of pain， and nausea or vomiting prior to discharge from the hospital.

【44】The temporal progression of an anesthetic can be separated into several phases： the beginning is typically referred to as induction， the middle， as main-tenance， and the end， emergence. The depth of anesthesia， or progression to and from unconsciousness， is referred to as the stages of anesthesia. 删除25：<u>通用删除1(英):<u>(Please see Table 10-4)</u></u>. Stage I lasts from full consciousness until a patient closes his eyes. Stage II begins when the patient closes his eyes. It is characterized by a hyper-excitability to external stimuli which may include vocalization and movement， the loss of protective airway reflexes， and autonomic instability. Stage II ends when patients regain autonomic stability. It is during this stage that patients are most vulnerable. Stage III is the stage of surgical anesthesia. It is divided into four planes； planes 3 and 4 are optimal for surgery.

【45】Prior to the induction of anesthesia， monitors are placed including a blood pressure cuff， an electrocardiogram， a pulse oximeter， a capnograph (which monitors end-tidal CO， detecting any deficit in ventilation or metabolism or elimination of CO，)， and an oxygen analyzer in the breathing circuit (which confirms the continuous flow of oxygen).

【46】Anesthesia is most frequently induced using an intravenous anesthetic such as propofol， etomidate， or sodium thiopental. Patients perceive intravenous anesthetics as a pleasant way to go to sleep， and these agents rapidly render the patient into Stage III of anesthesia， quickly traversing the troublesome Stage II.

【47】Once anesthesia is induced and patients enter Stages II or III， the oral and pharyngeal muscles lose tone and the patient’s airway often begins to obstruct. The airway can be managed by tilting the head back and moving the jaw for-ward at the angle of the mandible until the airway is patent. An oral airway may be helpful in preventing the tongue from obstr1ucting ：11t.he： pharynx， or itmay not be necessary. Induction can also be accomplished with inhalational anesthetics， and with the newer agents， can be quite pleasant. However， patients do not traverse Stage II as rapidly， and are thus vulnerable to aspira-tion and difficult airway management for that short period of time.
删除4：<u>Table 10-5 INDICATIONS FOR TRACHEAL INTUBATION</u>

【48】·Airway access

【49】·Airway protection

【50】· Need for muscle relaxation (paralysis)

【51】·Length of procedure (>2 hours)

【52】·Need for mechanical ventilation

【53】Anesthesia is typically maintained with an inhalation agent such as desflu-rane or sevoflurane， or with an intravenous infusion of propofol. Oxygen and inhalation anesthetics are administered with a mask or through airway device such as a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) or an endotracheal tube. It should be noted that after a period of 2 hours， pressure on nerves from a mask may cause nerve palsies involving small branches of the facial nerves， particularly in the peri-oral region， potentially yielding hyperesthesia or analgesia on the face. The laryngeal mask airway can similarly cause pressure on the recurrent laryn-geal nerves， leading to (usually transient) vocal cord paralysis.

【54】Unlike a mask or laryngeal mask airway， the placement of an endotracheal tube usually requires paralyzing a patient with a neuromuscular blocker. Since paralysis removes the patient’s ability to breathe， and ssince intubation requires the mechanical instrumentation of the pharynx and trachea (which can lead to complications)， intubation is only performed when there is an indication. 删除25：<u>通用删除1(英):<u>(Please see Table 10-5.)</u></u>

【55】The maintenance of anesthesia is often supplemented with an opiate to reduce pain during and after surgery. This in turn facilitates a reduction in the amount of anesthetic that is required. This patient， for example， would receive desflurane as the inhalation agent， O2， and a small amount of fentanyl added near the end of the procedure to minimize postoperative pain.

【56】As wound closure begins， the anesthetic agent is discontinued. Emergence begins， and the patient is allowed to awaken. He traverses the stages of anesthesia in reverse order， including Stage II. In fact， Stage II is more likely to be observed at emergence than induction， because at induction， patients receive an intravenous induction agent and pass rapidly (and almost imperceptibly) through Stage II.

【57】CLINICAL SUMMARY

【58】This healthy man undergoing an arthroscopy will be monitored with a blood pressure cuff， electrocardiogram， pulse oximeter， end-tidal CO， monitLOr(capnograph)， and a circuit oxygen analyzer. His anesthetic will be induced with propofol， a laryngeal mask placed， and his anesthetic maintained with desflurane including a small amount of opiate at the end of the case. Once he awakens and can respond to commands (meaning that he has successfully tra-versed Stage II)， the laryngeal mask will be removed.苏锦恭
