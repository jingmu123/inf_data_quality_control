【0】CASE 31: SOMETHING’S NOT QUITE RIGHT

【1】History

【2】A 24-year-old man’s parents bring him to see you. Up until a few months ago he seemed to  删除换行1 be doing well and there were no concerns. He was in the second year of his PhD, but then  删除换行1 apparently quite suddenly lost interest in his academic work and also stopped socializing  删除换行1 with his friends. He returned to live at home and has been increasingly more withdrawn at  删除换行1 home. He is speaking less and less and is becoming apathetic and rarely shows any emotion  删除换行1 or engagement with anyone including his family members with whom he had been reasonably close. When asked how he is, the man insists he is fine and he cannot understand his  删除换行1 parents’ concern. When asked about what they think is wrong, his parents cannot say what  删除换行1 concerns them, but they are sure something is not right.

【3】Mental state examination

【4】His eye contact is variable and when he does make eye contact it is fixed but there is no sense  删除换行1 of rapport with you. He is a polite and reasonably cooperative man. He does not appear  删除换行1 anxious or agitated but appears rather flat in affect. He seems slightly detached from his  删除换行1 parents and does not look at them. His speech appears normal, but he does at times struggle  删除换行1 to answer even quite basic questions and his responses are short. He describes his mood as  删除换行1 ‘fine’ and denies any self-harm ideation. He does not look depressed but seems detached and  删除换行1 in a world of his own. He denies any hallucinations or delusions. There is no evidence of any  删除换行1 thought disorder, although he says very little so this is difficult to elicit. He is orientated in  删除换行1 time, place and person. His serial sevens testing is poor, but his parents say he has never been  删除换行1 good at mathematics.

【5】You then call (with his consent) his university tutor who reports that a few months prior to  删除换行1 him leaving university and returning home, it was brought to the tutor’s attention by his  删除换行1 peers that there had been episodes of strange and erratic behaviour. By the time the university health service saw him, the episodes seemed to have settled, but it was suggested he  删除换行1 would benefit from a break.

【6】Questions

【7】• What is the differential diagnosis?

【8】• How would you manage this case?

【9】ANSWER 31

【10】The man needs to be assessed and he will need to be seen alone. If he has capacity, his consent  删除换行1 is required to share information about his care with his parents. You will need to ask about  删除换行1 any changes in mood, any experience of perceptual abnormality, any evidence of delusions  删除换行1 and any changes in behaviour. A risk assessment is also needed.

【11】The differential diagnoses will include depression, substance misuse, schizophrenia presenting with negative symptoms, autism spectrum disorder (extremely unlikely as onset appears  删除换行1 to be recent and autism spectrum disorder would have displayed features from before age 3) 删除换行1 and possible organic causes.

【12】The most likely diagnoses are depression or schizophrenia. This man appears to be presenting with the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, but it is important not to jump too quickly  删除换行1 to conclusions as making this diagnosis has a number of weighty implications for this man  删除换行1 and his family. Make sure that other possibilities are excluded.

【13】Although there are no tests that can diagnose schizophrenia, simple blood and urine tests  删除换行1 can rule out other medical causes of symptoms. Brain imaging studies, such as magnetic  删除换行1 resonance imaging or a computed tomography scan, can exclude other rare problems such  删除换行1 as space-occupying lesions. A thorough history and blood screen could exclude any missed  删除换行1 systemic illness such as anaemia or hypothyroidism.

【14】The management of this man would depend on the final diagnosis. Initial treatment may  删除换行1 focus on psychosocial interventions including psychoeducation, activity scheduling, family  删除换行1 therapy and cognitive behaviour therapy. Other aspects of treatment include the development of coping strategies and helping him function the best he can whatever the symptoms  删除换行1 are. Depression would warrant antidepressants, and a diagnosis of schizophrenia would  删除换行1 involve treatment with antipsychotic medication, although compliance may be an issue as  删除换行1 the man does not believe he is unwell. Psychosocial interventions would allow a period of  删除换行1 monitoring before deciding on medication. Antipsychotics appear less effective in reducing negative symptoms than positive ones. Educating and supporting the family are also  删除换行1 important components of care. It is very important that patients stay in treatment even after 

【15】Negative symptoms and signs of schizophrenia

【16】• Avolition and low energy – the person tends to sit around and sleep much more  删除换行1 than normal, lacks interest in life and has poor motivation.

【17】• Affective flattening – a blank, blunted facial expression or less lively facial movements, flat voice (lack of normal intonations and variance) or physical movements  删除换行1 and poverty of emotional expression compared to before.

【18】• Alogia describes poverty of speech.

【19】• Interest in others is reduced.

【20】• Inability to make friends or keep friends.

【21】• Social isolation.

【22】• Poor self-care.

【23】• Catatonia can present in a number of ways with profound effects on movement  删除换行1 and activity. There may be an apparent unawareness of the environment, near total  删除换行1 absence of motion and speech, aimless body movements and bizarre postures.
Case 31: Something’s not quite right 删除换行1 recovery. Four out of five patients who stop taking their medication after a first episode of  删除换行1 schizophrenia will have a relapse. Relapse prevention work is therefore a key part of any  删除换行1 treatment programme.

【24】Key Points

【25】• Antipsychotic medication is less effective for the negative symptoms of schizophrenia; only with clozapine is there good evidence of significant effects on negative symptoms.

【26】• Educating and supporting the family are key components of care.
