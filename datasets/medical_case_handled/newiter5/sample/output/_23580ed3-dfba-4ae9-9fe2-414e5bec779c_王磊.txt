【0】Question: 40.1 A 35-year-old man is infected with HIV and is antibody-positive. He also has a CD4 count of 50 cells/mm <sup>3 </sup> (normal range: 500–1000 cells/mm <sup>3 </sup> ). He has had a fever of 101°F (38.3°C) for a few weeks and “feels tired all the time.” He has no other symptoms, and findings on physical examination are normal. CBC, urinalysis, and chest radiography are normal. Bone marrow biopsy reveals granulomas, and a culture grows an organism that is a budding yeast at 98.6°F (37°C) but produces hyphae and tuberculated chlamydospores at 77°F (25°C). Of the following, which is the most likely cause?

【1】A. Aspergillus fumigatus

【2】B. Coccidioides immitis

【3】C. Cryptococcus neoformans

【4】D. Histoplasma capsulatum

【5】E. Mucor species

【6】Answer: 40.1 D. An individual who is HIV-positive may have normal immune capacity, as measured by laboratory parameters, but will still be more at risk for opportunistic organisms. Respiratory infections may have been caused by fungi, bacteria, or viruses. As a result, laboratory results may be crucial in determining the exact organism causing an infection. In this case, bone marrow biopsy revealed a budding yeast form at 98.6°F (37°C), but hyphae and tuberculated chlamydospores at room temperature (77°F \[25°C\]). In disseminated histoplasmosis, bone marrow cultures are often positive. Tuberculate macroconidia are characteristic for the mycelial form of H. capsulatum .

【7】Question: 40.2 A 4-year-old girl who lives in California has had a low-grade fever. Skin tests performed for the first time give the following results:

【8】The test results suggest which of the following?

【9】A. The patient has been exposed to C. immitis .

【10】B. The patient has been immunized against C. immitis .

【11】C. The patient has had scarlet fever.

【12】D. The patient has IgG antibody to Mycobacterium tuberculosis .

【13】E. The patient has immunity to Corynebacterium diphtheriae .

【14】Answer: 40.2 A. The Dick and Schick tests relate to streptococcal/corynebacterial infections, specifically scarlet fever and diphtheria, respectively. The young girl has been exposed to Mycobacterium , most likely M. tuberculosis , but the positive reaction observed is based on a cellular immune reaction, not one mediated by antibodies. The location is a region where Coccidioides is endemic and should be one of the suspected pathogens to be considered. No vaccine is available for C. immitis . Therefore, a positive coccidioidin test indicates that the young girl has been exposed to the agent and has developed a cellular immune reaction in response.

【15】Question: 40.3 A 50-year-old immunocompromised woman is diagnosed as having meningitis. A latex agglutination test on the spinal fluid for capsular polysaccharide antigen is positive. Of the following organisms, which one is the most likely cause?

【16】A. Aspergillus fumigatus

【17】B. Cryptococcus neoformans

【18】C. Histoplasma capsulatum

【19】D. Nocardia asteroides

【20】E. Toxoplasma gondii

【21】Answer: 40.3 B. Cryptococcus neoformans is yeast characterized by a thick polysaccharide capsule. It occurs worldwide in nature and in very large numbers in pigeon feces. Cryptococcus infection is usually associated with immunosuppression. Tests for capsular antigen can be performed on cerebrospinal fluid and serum. The latex agglutination test for cryptococcal antigen is positive in 90% of patients with cryptococcal meningitis (meaning a sensitivity rate of 90%). With effective treatment (amphotericin B and possibly flucytosine), the antigen titer usually drops, except in patients with AIDS.

【22】Question: 40.4 Which of the following is the most common portal of entry in B. dermatitidis infection?

【23】A. Genitourinary tract

【24】B. Lymphatic system

【25】C. Mouth

【26】D. Respiratory tract

【27】E. Skin
Answer: 40.4 D. B. dermatitidis grows as a mold culture, producing septate hyphae and conidia. In a host, it converts to a large, singly budding yeast cell. It is endemic in North America. Human infection is initiated in the lungs. Diagnosis may be difficult because no skin (despite the name, which probably comes from the fact that it can spread to cutaneous disease in late stages) or serologic tests exist. Chronic pneumonia is a common presentation. Sputum, pus, exudates, urine, and lung biopsy material can be examined microscopically, looking for thick walled yeast cells with broadly attached buds. It may also be cultured.

【28】MICROBIOLOGY PEARLS

【29】 C. immitis is a dimorphic, systemic fungus, commonly found in the soil of arid areas.

【30】 Most patients exposed to the arthroconidia of C. immitis develop an asymptomatic or respiratory infection. Disseminated disease occurs rarely in severely immunosuppressed patients.

【31】 Person-to-person transmission of C. immitis is not known to occur.王磊
