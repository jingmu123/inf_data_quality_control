【0】CASE 19: A PAINFUL FOOT FOLLOWING A TRAFFIC INCIDENT

【1】History

【2】A 45-year-old builder was driving to work when a cyclist swerved in front of him. He  删除换行1 swerved but crashed the van despite some forceful braking. The van was crushed and the  删除换行1 brake pedal had to be cut to free his foot. He reported that his foot was extremely painful  删除换行1 and he was taken to hospital.

【3】Examination

【4】The builder says that he has pain in his hind foot only. On inspection he has a closed  删除换行1 injury with significant midfoot swelling. He has no neurovascular deficit. He had palpable  删除换行1 tenderness just proximal to his midfoot. Radiographs are shown in Figs 19.1 and 19.2.

【6】Questions

【7】• What is the diagnosis?

【8】• What other injuries are associated with this injury?

【9】• Describe the blood supply to the talus.

【10】• What are possible complications of this injury?

【11】ANSWER 19

【12】The diagnosis is a talus fracture. The lateral X-ray shows a displaced fracture through the  删除换行1 talar neck. The classification of talar neck fractures was described by Hawkins in 1970.

【13】• With type I injuries, the talar neck fracture remains undisplaced.

【14】• With type II injuries, the talar neck fracture is displaced and the subtalar joint is subluxated or dislocated. (In the present case the talar neck is fractured but the subtalar  删除换行1 joint is not dislocated.)

【15】• With type III injuries, the talar neck fracture is displaced and the body of the talus is  删除换行1 dislocated from both the subtalar and ankle joints. The body is usually extruded posteromedially to rest between the Achilles tendon and the posterior surface of the tibia.

【16】• With type IV injuries, a displaced talar neck fracture is associated with dislocation of  删除换行1 the talar body from both the subtalar and ankle joints, and dislocation of the talar  删除换行1 head from the talonavicular joint.

【17】Hawkins’s sign is the appearance of a zone of osteopenia or lucency under the subchondral bone of the talar dome.

【18】Associated injuries are common, and frequently include the medial malleous and lumbar  删除换行1 spine fractures.

【19】The middle portion of the talar body receives its blood supply from the tarsal canal artery,  删除换行1 which consistently arises 2 cm below the ankle from the posterior tibial artery. About  删除换行1 5 mm from its origin the tarsal canal artery gives off a deltoid branch, which supplies the  删除换行1 medial quarter of the talar body. The dorsalis pedis and peroneal arteries have branches  删除换行1 which anastomose to form the tarsal sinus artery. The tarsal sinus artery provides blood  删除换行1 to the lateral aspect of the talar body and the majority of the talar head.
With type I fractures the intraosseous vessels coursing from distal to proximal in the talar  删除换行1 neck are disrupted, so the avascular necrosis (AVN) rate of the talar body ranges from 0 to  删除换行1 10 per cent. With type II fractures, the intraosseous blood supply and the vessels coursing  删除换行1 inferiorly from the tarsal sinus artery are damaged (likely in the present case). The AVN  删除换行5 rate is 20–50 per cent. With type III fractures, the AVN rate ranges from 50 to 100 per  删除换行1 cent, as the intraosseous, tarsal sinus, tarsal canal and deltoid vessels are all injured. With  删除换行1 type IV fractures, the risk of AVN of the talar body approaches 100 per cent and damage  删除换行1 to the blood supply to the talar head occurs as well.

【20】KEY POINTS

【21】• Talus fractures occur with forced dorsiflexion injury.

【22】• The talus has a tenuous blood supply.

【23】• Associated injuries are common, and frequently include the medial malleolus and  删除换行1 lumbar spine fractures.

【24】• Risk of avascular necrosis depends on the degree of displacement and ranges from 10  删除换行1 to 100 per cent.

【25】• Hawkins’s sign is the appearance of a zone of osteopenia or lucency under the  删除换行1 subchondral bone of the talar dome.删除个例：<u>Orthopaedics</u>苏锦恭
