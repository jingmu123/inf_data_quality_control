【0】\[27.1\] A 23-year-old man presents with a “lump”in the distal portion of his left femur. Workup finds a cartilage-capped outgrowth of bone that is connected to the underlying skeleton by a bony stalk. No destruction of the underlying bone is seen. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

【1】A. Chondroblastoma

【2】B. Chondrosarcoma

【3】C. Osteoblastoma

【4】D. Osteochondroma

【5】E. Osteosarcoma

【6】\[27.21Which of the following clinical signs or symptoms is most character-istically associated with a benign osteoid osteoma?

【7】A. Nontender swelling in the popliteal space

【8】B. Numbness and tingling in the fourth and fifth fingers

【9】C. Pain in the first toe that occurs after binge drinking

【10】D. Severe pain in the femur that occurs at night

【11】E. Stiffness in the knee that is worse in the morning

【12】\[27.3\] An 11-year-old boy presents with an enlarging painful lesion in the medullary cavity of his left femur. X-rays reveal a destructive lesion that produces an"onion-skin”periosteal reaction. The lesion is surgi-cally resected， and histologic sections reveal sheets of small round cells with cytoplasmic glycogen. This tumor most often is associated with which of the following chromosomal abnormalities?

【13】A. t(8；14)

【14】B. t(9；22)

【15】C. t(11；22)

【16】D. t(14；18)

【17】E. t(15；17)

【18】Answers

【19】\[27.11 D. An osteochondroma is a benign tumor of bone that is composed of a bony outgrowth that has a hyaline cartilage cap. It is the most com-mon benign bone tumor and is found most commonly in males under the age of 25 years. Osteochondromas usually originate from the metaphysis of long bones， with the lower end of the femur and the upper end of the tibia being common sites. Some consider osteo-chondromas to be a form of exostosis or hamartoma rather than a true neoplasm. Malignant transformation can occur but is quite rare.

【20】\[27.2\] D. An osteoid osteoma is a benign tumor of bone that characteristi-cally produces severe pain at night as a result the excess production of prostaglandin E . Also characteristic is the fact that this nocturnal pain is relieved by aspirin. This benign bone tumor occurs most fre-quently in males in the second decade and most often occurs in the femur. Histologic sections of the tumor reveal 8 a central nidus of uncalcified osteoid with a rim of sclerotic bone.

【21】\[27.3\] C. Ewing sarcoma is a malignancy of bones that is found most com-monly in males under the age of 15 years. It usually is located in the diaphysis or metaphysis of long bones. Histologically， this tumor is composed of sheets of small round cells with cytoplasmic glycogen that is PAS-positive. Reactive new bone formation produces a con-centric onionskin layering appearance on x-ray examination. This malignancy is similar， and probably identical， to primitive neuroen-docrine tumor or neuroblastoma cells located elsewhere in the bodv It shares the same chromosomal abnormality t(11；22) with these other primitive neuroectodermal tumors.

【22】PATHOLOGY PEARLS

【23】Risk factors for osteosarcoma include prior irradiation， genetic pre-disposition (parents with reintoblastoma)， Paget disease of the bone， and bone infarcts.

【24】A radiograph revealing lytic lesions of the bone with a periosteum reaction near the metaphysis raises suspicion for osteosarcoma.

【25】Osteochondroma is the most common benign tumor of bone， found most commonly in men under the age of 25 years. It is a bony growth that is found to be covered by a cap of cartilage projecting from the surface of a bone.王磊
