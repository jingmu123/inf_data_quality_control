【0】CASE 17: CHRONIC BLISTERING ERUPTION ON THE

【1】DORSAL HANDS

【2】History

【3】A 49-year-old man presents to the dermatology out-patient clinic with a 6-month history of a gradually worsening rash on the dorsi of his hands. He had first noticed a few  删除换行1 small blisters developing in the early spring and since then more have appeared. He is  删除换行1 concerned about the scarring marks left on his hands. He has recently been made redundant and as a result has been drinking large quantities of alcohol. He has no history of  删除换行1 previous skin problems or atopy. He is otherwise well and does not take any regular  删除换行1 medication.

【4】Examination

【5】Over the dorsi of his hands are scattered tense vesicles and bullae with multiple erosions,  删除换行1 scarring, milia and pigmentation 删除33：<u></u>. Full skin examination reveals similar small  删除换行1 scars on his face and minimal hypertrichosis. The rest of the skin is normal.

【6】Questions

【7】• What is the diagnosis?

【8】• What is the underlying cause?

【9】• How would you confirm the diagnosis?

【11】ANSWER 17

【12】This patient was not aware that he was photosensitive due to the insidious onset of his  删除换行1 skin eruption over many months. Medical practitioners should suspect photosensitivity  删除换行1 if skin disease affects exposed skin sites – classically the face, hands and anterior chest.
On direct questioning, patients may report a worsening of their skin condition during the  删除换行1 summer or following a holiday abroad.
This patient was diagnosed with porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) which usually presents  删除换行1 between the 3rd to 5th decades. The condition is characterized by skin fragility leading  删除换行1 to blister formation following minor trauma. Initially, skin changes include tense vesicles/bullae and erosions on a background of normal-looking skin. However, these heal  删除换行1 to leave small atrophic scars and milia (inclusion cysts) as seen in this patient. Waxylooking plaques and hypertrichosis may also be seen.
Porphyrins are important in the formation of haemoglobin, myoglobin and cytochromes.
The porphyrias are diseases in which specific enzyme deficiencies lead to the accumulation of intermediate metabolites in the porphyrin biosynthesis pathway. Porphyrins  删除换行1 absorb light in the 400–405 nm range (the lower range of visible light). This absorbed  删除换行1 light is then transferred to cellular structures, causing damage to tissues. Deficiency of  删除换行1 the enzyme uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD) is responsible for PCT, which may  删除换行1 be inherited or acquired. Patients with acquired disease are deficient in UROD in their  删除换行1 liver and therefore express the disease phenotypically when triggered by agents such as  删除换行1 alcohol, oestrogen and hepatitis C. Familial PCT is inherited in an autosomal dominant  删除换行1 fashion with a resultant defect in the synthesis of UROD.
A skin biopsy reveals subepidermal bullae. Wood’s lamp examination of the urine shows  删除换行1 orange red fluorescence. A porphyrin screen reveals raised uroporphyrin I in the urine  删除换行1 and increased levels of isocoproporphyrins in the stool.

【13】Treatments include eliminating possible trigger factors such as alcohol. Patients should  删除换行1 be protected from both ultraviolet and visible light. Management includes venesection to  删除换行1 reduce iron stores or low-dose oral chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine.

【14】 KEY POINTS

【15】• PCT occurs due to deficiency of the enzyme uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase.

【16】• It may be inherited or acquired. Triggers include alcohol, oestrogen and hepatitis C.
• Skin changes include fragility, tense vesicles/bullae, erosions, atrophic scars and milia.焦瀚远
