【0】13.4 Case Study
---------------

【1】Subjective: R.M. is a 65-year-old white male with a history of HFrEF (LVEF 35%), type 2 DM, hyperlipidemia, obesity, general anxiety, and depression, who presents with his wife for evaluation. According to his wife, over the past month, “he has been coughing non-stop and complains about being tired all the time.” She’s worried he has bronchitis and wants an antibiotic and cough medicine prescribed. In addition, he states he does not feel rested upon waking and often falls asleep watching TV or reading a book. His weight has been stable and has not noticed any LE edema. Has not required furosemide since last month. He denies chest pain, palpitations, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. He is experiencing increased dyspnea on exertion with ADLs. He denies any worsening anxiety but endorses not enjoying activities with family and friends “like I used to.”

【30】Objective

【31】Vital Signs: T 98.6 BP 110/70 HR 88 RR 22 O通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>2 </sup></u> sat 88% RA

【32】Physical examination is unremarkable except for crackles throughout all lung fields which clear with cough.

【33】Testing Ordered

【34】Concerns arise that R.M. may have undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder. He is given the STOP-Bang questionnaire and answers “yes” to 3 of 4 STOP questions and “yes” to 3 of 4 Bang questions. In addition, his score on the ESS is 14 indicating moderate excessive daytime sleepiness.

【35】Diagnostic testing for his dyspnea and cough includes a chest X-ray that reveals flattening of the diaphragm with destruction of the lung parenchyma. There are no findings suggestive of pneumonia. Pulmonary function tests reveal an FEV <sub>1 </sub> of 65% placing him in GOLD category two for COPD, with moderate severity of disease. Alpha-1 antitrypsin is negative. A complete blood count reveals no evidence of anemia or infection. An echocardiogram reveals a reduced ejection fraction, 35%, which is unchanged from one done six months ago.

【36】Assessment: Newly diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

【37】HFrEF (LVEF 35%)

【38】Type 2 diabetes

【39】Hyperlipidemia

【40】Obesity (BMI = 35.7 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> )

【41】Generalized anxiety disorder

【42】Major depressive disorder (recurrent, moderate)

【43】Plan:

【44】HFrEF, type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, obesity, anxiety, and depression medications were refilled for 3 months without changes.

【45】Sleep apnea: There was a minimal concern for other sleep disorders, but an HSAT was ordered and R.M. was found to have an AHI = 50 episodes/h. As a result, CPAP therapy was ordered and R.M. was able to tolerate the mask and was able to wear it for 6–7 h/night for 6 days/week. Automated reports obtained from the CPAP machine now show that R.M. is having <5 apneic or hypopneic episodes per hour.

【46】COPD: A long-acting bronchodilator is begun at this visit. In addition, R.M. receives counseling on the importance of avoiding passive cigarette smoke and other noxious fumes. A cardiopulmonary rehabilitation referral is made to evaluate his current physical activity level to improve it with therapy. COPD places him at increased risk for infections, and R.M. was given influenza and pneumococcal vaccines.

【47】At a return visit, R.M. states that he is feeling more rested upon waking, has more energy throughout the day, and is not falling asleep while watching TV or reading a book. His cough has improved. His respiratory rate today is 16 and his oxygen saturation is 96% on room air. Lungs are bilaterally CTA.苏锦恭
