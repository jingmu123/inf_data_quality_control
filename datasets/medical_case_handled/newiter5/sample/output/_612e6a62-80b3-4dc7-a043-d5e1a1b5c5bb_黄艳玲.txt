【0】Case 36

【1】All pheochromocytomas are biochemically undetect-able when small-they require a sizable “factory"to become biochemically detectable. Thus publications that report that a laboratory test is 98% or 100%sensitive in detecting pheochromocytomas is sim-ply wrong-just not possible! Computed abdominal imaging is being performed for a never-ending list of reasons. We are finding “baby" pheochromocytomas before they become symptomatic or biochemically detectable.Herein is such a case.

【2】Case Report

【3】The patient was a healthy 49-year-old man who had been troubled by intermittent right upper quadrant pain， which was thought to be related to gallbladder dysfunction. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) incidentally discovered a 1.6-cm ipid-poor and vascular left adrenal mass 删除33：<u></u>. He had no signs or symptoms of adrenal cortical or medullary dysfunction. He took no regular medica-tions. His blood pressure was 128/78 mmHg， heart rate 74 beats per minute， and body mass index26.51 kg/m2.

【6】TREATMENT

【7】The patient was informed that he had a dense and vascular adrenal mass that could be a prebiochemi-cal pheochromocytoma or a very small adreno-cortical carcinoma. He was advised to either have 删除换行1 a laparoscopic left adrenalectomy or close imaging follow-up. The patient elected to proceed with sur-gery. He was prepared with the a-adrenergic blocker doxazosin， which was titrated for low-normal systolic blood pressure for age. The patient underwent laparo-scopic left adrenalectomy. The adrenal gland weighed8 g (normal，4-5 g)， and the pheochromocytoma mea-sured 2.1×1.7×1.3 cm 删除33：<u></u>. The patient was discharged from the hospital the day after surgery.

【8】OUTCOME AND FOLLOW-UP

【9】The patient recovered from surgery over the subse-quent 7 days and he returned to work. One year later his plasma fractionated metanephrines were normal. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) was performed for other reasons and his right adrenal gland appeared normal and there was no sign of a paraganglioma. The patient declined germline genetic testing.

【10】Discussion

【11】We are frequently asked about whether preopera-tive adrenergic blockade should be administered to patients with pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma who have normal levels of fractionated catecholamines and metanephrines. In our review of 258 patients who underwent resection of a pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma， intraoperative hemodynamic vari-ability was greater with higher preoperative levels of fractionated catecholamines and metanephrines(P<.001).1 However， substantial hemodynamic vari-ability was observed even when preoperative fraction-ated catecholamines and metanephrines were within the normal range.

【17】Key Points

【18】●With the advent of widespread use of computed abdominal imaging， most patients with pheo-chromocytoma are discovered incidentally on im-aging performed for other reasons.

【19】· Lipid-poor adrenal masses should be considered pheochromocytoma until proven otherwise.

【20】All pheochromocytomas are“prebiochemical”when small. There is no biochemical test that car-ries 100% sensitivity.

【21】Patients with pheochromocytoma or paragan-glioma that is associated with normal levels of fractionated catecholamines and metanephrines should be prepared for surgery with adrenergic blockade.黄艳玲
