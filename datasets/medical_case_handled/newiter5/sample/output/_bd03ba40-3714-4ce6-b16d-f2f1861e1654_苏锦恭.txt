【1】History of Pregnancy in a41-Year-0ld woman With Undiagnosed Cushing Syndrome

【2】Workup for corticotropin(ACTH)-independent hypercortisolism is required in any patient with an adrenal mass， regardless of symptoms of hormone excess. Unfortunately， only a minority of patients with adrenal incidentalomas undergo appropriate workup. Although Cushing syndrome (CS) is asso-ciated with physical and metabolic changes，approxi-mately half of patients with adrenal CS are diagnosed incidentally， suggesting poor recognition of CS in the clinical practice. Undiagnosed CS may present with abnormal menses and infertility.2 During pregnancy， unrecognized and untreated CS may be associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes.3.4

【3】Case Report

【4】A 41-year-old woman presented for evaluation of an adrenal mass. After searching online for a rea-son for her symptoms， she came across a descrip-tion of “Cushing syndrome" and requested further workup. She reported a 5-year history of progres-sive muscle weakness， weight gain， episodes of dia-phoresis， and menstrual irregularity. Over the prior2 years， she developed moon facies， dorsocervical and supraclavicular pads， erythema， insomnia， dif-ficulty concentrating， and an increase in anxiety and depression. She was diagnosed with new onset hypertension and dyslipidemia 2 years ago. Over-all， she gained 50 pounds over the prior 5 years， and 20 pounds in the prior 2 years.

【5】Several years ago， after unsuccessfully attempt-ing to conceive for 12 months， she pursued fertility therapy. During pregnancy， she developed gesta-tional diabetes that necessitated insulin therapy.

【6】Otherwise， her medical history was positive for nephrolithiasis. Two years prior an abdominal com-puted tomography (CT)scan wasperformed that described a 3-cm right adrenal mass. No hormonal workup was performed at that time.

【7】Her current medications included carvedilol、losar-tan， sertraline， and alprazolam. On physical examina-tion， her blood pressure was 138/88 mmHg and body mass index was 46.64 kg/m2. She had no striae or proximal myopathy but did have a dorsocervical pad， supraclavicular pads， and rounding and erythema of the face. She had minimal edema of the lower extremities.

【8】INVESTIGATIONS

【9】Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen that was per-formed recently was reviewed and compared to the CT performed 2 years prior. The most recent CT demon-strated a stable 3.3×2.1×3.1-cm right adrenal mass删除33：<u></u>. The left adrenal gland was atrophic. Hor-monal workup for hypercortisolism was performed， including morning measurement of ACTH and dehy-droepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S)， 1-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test (DST)， and 24-hour urinary free cortisol excretion. The laboratory data were consistent with ACTH-independent hypercorti-solism . Laparoscopic adrenalectomy was recommended.

【10】TREATMENT

【11】The patient was treated with a laparoscopic right adrenalectomy at an institution other than ours， with pathologic analysis demonstrating an adrenocortical adenoma. She was educated on adrenal insufficiency and initiated on hydrocortisone therapy.

【12】删除3：<u>Fig. 97.1 Axial (below) and coronal (above) images from a contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan showed a 3.3×2.1×3.1-cm right adrenal mass .</u>

【13】The patient presented with unrecognized， progressive ACTH-independent CS of at least 5 years duration. An opportunity for an earlier diagnosis was lost when the incidental discovery of an adrenal mass several years prior was dismissed as not clinically significant， without any workup at that time. Assuming another diagnosis is not obvious (e.g.，pheochromocytoma)， a DST should be performed in all patients with an adrenal mass， regard-less of symptoms of hormone excess. Our patient was diagnosed with overt CS， as she presented with clini-cal features of hypercortisolism on examination (Box C.1). Biochemical workup was consistent with ACTH-independent hypercortisolism with undetectable ACTH and DHEA-S， abnormal DST， and elevated 24-hour urine cortisol. With confirmation of ACTH-indepen-dent hypercortisolism， the unilateral adrenal mass was considered the culprit lesion， and adrenalectomy was

【16】recommended. Adrenal insufficiency andglucocorti-coid withdrawal should be anticipated andproperly treated in these cases .

【17】In retrospect， the patients irregular menses and infertility may have been caused or exacerbated by the undiagnosed and untreated CS.2 A systematic review of the literature reported adrenal CS as the most common CS subtype diagnosed during preg-nancy4 Patients with untreated CS during pregnancy had higher rates of pregnancy-related complications such as gestational diabetes mellitus (37%)， gesta-tional hypertension (41%)， and preeclampsia (26%).4Preterm delivery and low birth weight were the most common adverse fetal outcomes.
Depending on the severity of CS and gestation week， if diagnosed during pregnancy， conservative manage-ment of comorbidities， antepartum adrenalectomy， or medical therapy can be considered. Metyrapone is the most commonly used medication used for treatment of CS during pregnancy4.5 In-depth monitoring is required in these cases to document optimal therapy of hypercortisolism， prevent or appropriately treat adrenal insufficiency， observe for possible metyrapone-induced side effects of hypertension and hypokalemia， and adapt any ongoing management of hyperglycemia.

【18】Key Points

【19】Workup for ACTH-independent hypercortisolism is recommended in all patients with an adrenal mass， regardless of symptoms.

【20】●Untreated CS is associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes during pregnancy

【21】●Management of CS during pregnancy depends on its severity， etiology， and the gestational stage at diagnosis， and includes conservative management of comorbidities， surgery， or medical therapy.
