【0】Question: An 87-year-old man suffered an acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction a few minutes ago. He was subsequently treated with aspirin, metoprolol, and heparin. Immediately before being taken to the catheterization laboratory, the patient becomes unresponsive. He is placed on telemetry and his rhythm strip is shown in the image. Although the patient receives a series of emergent defibrillations, he does not convert to sinus rhythm. Due to failure to respond, the patient is given an agent associated with which of the following potential adverse effects?

【5】 Answer: The correct answer is D . Ventricular fibrillation is an irregular ventricular rhythm without any distinct QRS complexes, ST segments, or T waves. This is an important cause of sudden cardiac death, as well as mortality within the first 24 hours of an acute MI. If defibrillation fails to convert to sinus rhythm, the next treatment choice is the use of antiarrhythmics. There are four general classes of antiarrhythmics: class I blocks sodium channels, class II blocks β-adrenergic receptors, class III blocks potassium channels, and class IV blocks calcium channels. Epinephrine, amiodarone (class IA and class III properties), or lidocaine (class IB) are the agents indicated after a round of unsuccessful defibrillation. Of these agents, only amiodarone may produce the adverse effect of pulmonary fibrosis. Amiodarone is also associated with hypotension, thyroid dysfunction (both hypo- and hyperthyroidism), hepatotoxicity, ocular changes, and other arrhythmias (namely, bradyarrhythmias and torsades de pointes). In patients taking amiodarone, remember to check pulmonary function tests, liver function tests, and thyroid function tests.  
Answer A is incorrect . There is no increased risk of bleeding associated with any of the antiarrhythmic drugs. Warfarin and heparin are commonly used drugs that can cause bleeding. However, they would not be used during ventricular fibrillation.  
Answer B is incorrect . Class IC agents (ie, flecainide and encainide) are contraindicated in the post-MI population, due to their association with increased post-MI mortality. These drugs work at phase 3 of the action potential and have no effect on action potential duration. They are most often used in cases of ventricular tachycardia that progress to ventricular fibrillation, or intractable supraventricular tachycardia.  
Answer C is incorrect . Procainamide, a type 1A antiarrhythmic drug, is a common cause of drug-induced lupus, but it is not used to treat a patient in ventricular fibrillation. It acts by increasing action potential duration and increasing QT interval. It is most often used for treatment of re-entrant and ectopic supraventricular and ventricular tachycardia. Other drugs in this class include quinidine (which has the adverse effect of cinchonism), amiodarone (which is also a class III antiarrhythmic), and disopyramide.  
Answer E is incorrect . Digoxin toxicity can lead to disturbances in color vision, including yellow-green vision, as well as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and arrhythmias. Digoxin directly inhibits Na <sup class="calibre40">+ </sup> /K <sup class="calibre40">+ </sup> \-ATPase, leading to indirect inhibition of the Na <sup class="calibre40">+ </sup> /Ca <sup class="calibre40">2+ </sup> exchanger. Therefore there is an increase in intracellular calcium, leading to positive inotropy. This drug is most often used for chronic heart failure and control of atrial fibrillation, not for ventricular fibrillation.焦瀚远
