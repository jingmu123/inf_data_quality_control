【0】Case 83 Hepatic Jaundice

【1】A 23-year-old male is coming with complain of high grade fever fui past 10 days is associated with nausea and loss of appetite. He complains of ye! w discoloration of eye and skin for past 1 week.

【2】OOrn examination， he was found to be icteric and liver was mildl， enlarged and was tender.

【3】Following are the results of various laboratory investigations：

【4】Blood biochemistry：

【5】Total bilirubin 5.2 mg% (normal= 0.2-1.2 mg/dl) Indirect bilirubin 3.7 mg%(normal= 0.2-1.0 mg/dl) Direct bilirubin 1.5 mg% (normal=0.0-0.2 mg/dl) SGOT 1145 IU/L (normal=15-45IU/L) SGPT 692 IU/L (normal=15-45 TU/L) Serum ALP 220 U/L (normal=98-298IU/L)

【6】Urine examination：

【7】Bile pigments Positive

【8】Urobilinogen Positive

【9】Bile salts Positive

【10】HBsAg\ (Australian antigen) was positive.

【11】Attending physician makes the diagnosis of hepatic jaundice of viral etiology and further workup was planned to diagnose the cause.

【12】QUESTIONS

【13】Q.1. Why in hepatic jaundice both conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin tend to increase：

【14】Q.2. What are the possible causes for hepatic jaundice?

【15】Q.3. What is the normal level of direct， indirect and total bilirubin in the plasma?

【16】Q.4. What is the development history of bilirubin analysis?

【17】Q.5. Explain the principle of Malloy-Evelyn method.

【21】Toxic isults to liver due to various chemicals and noxious agents also damage the liver and ause hepatic jaundice.

【22】Ans.3. Normal value of total bilirubin： 0.2 to 1.2 mg/dl

【23】Normal value of conjugated bilirubin： 0.0 to 0.2 mg/dl

【24】Normal value of unconjugated bilirubin： 0.2 to 1.0 mg/d1

【25】Ans.4. Overview of bilirubin analysis developmental history

【26】Ehrlich in 1883 first described a method by which urinary bilirubin makes a colored complex with diazotized sulfanilic acid. This was classically known as "Diazo reaction".
Followed by this in the year 1938， Jendrassik-Grof proposed a method in which plasma bilirubin was quantitated using caffeine-benzoate-acetate as an accelerator.

【27】Today most of the methods of estimation of bilirubin is based on Malloy-Evelyn method， in spite of the fact the Jendrassik-Grof method is considered as candidate reference method by AACC (American Association of Clinical Chemistry).

【28】Ans.5. Malloy-Evelyn Method

【29】Prin iple： This method is based on the principle of van den Bergh， where plasma or serum bilirubin interacts with diazotized sulfanilic acid to form azobilirubin which iS reddish punple compound and the color thus produced is measured colorimetricallyV at 58o ioh pure os of color measured is directly proportional to amount of solut bilirubin.
