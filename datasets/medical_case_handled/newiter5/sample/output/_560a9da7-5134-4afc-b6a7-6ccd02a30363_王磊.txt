【0】CASE 20: MANAGING DELIRIUM

【1】History

【2】An 83-year-old woman was admitted to hospital with shortness of breath and fever. She was  删除换行1 diagnosed with a community-acquired pneumonia and was treated with intravenous antibiotics. Despite being lucid throughout the day, she became agitated and confused overnight.
The following morning, the patient’s mental state and cognition had returned to baseline.
The patient had no history of dementia or cognitive impairment. Her past history was significant for hypertension and a previous hip replacement. Her regular medications were ramipril 

【3】2.5 mg OD and paracetamol 1 g QDS PRN. She lived alone and was independent with all  删除换行1 activities of daily living. She did not drink alcohol and had never smoked.

【4】Examination

【5】The  patient was examined whilst she was confused. She  was alert and agitated. She  was  删除换行1 not  orientated to time or place but was orientated to person. Cardiovascular, respiratory,  删除换行1 abdominal and neurological examinations were unremarkable.

【6】Results

【7】Bloods: WCC 11.6 (neutrophils 8.1), Hb 102, MCV 83, Plt 344, Na 140, K 4.1, Creat 65, CRP 72

【8】Questions

【9】1. Which investigations should be considered to identify a cause for the patient’s transient confusion?

【10】2. If the patient becomes confused and agitated again, which medications could be  删除换行1 prescribed to manage this?

【11】ANSWERS

【12】1. The patient has fluctuating confusion consistent with delirium. Infection is a common precipitant for delirium and, in this case, the patient has an underlying pneumonia. Where infection is suspected as a cause for delirium, blood tests should be  删除换行1 sent to identify possible raised inflammatory markers. Blood cultures should be  删除换行1 considered, particularly if the patient is febrile and investigations such as a sputum  删除换行1 culture, urine dip, stool sample for microscopy and culture if there is diarrhoea, and  删除换行1 a chest X-ray should be considered.

【13】 Electrolyte abnormalities, particularly hyper- and hyponatraemia, hyper- and  删除换行1 hypoglycaemia, and hypercalcaemia, are common causes of confusion, and these  删除换行1 should therefore be checked. Hyper- and hypothyroidism can also lead to cognitive  删除换行1 impairment, and a thyroid stimulating hormone level should therefore be measured.

【14】 If there is a history of preceding trauma such as a fall that resulted in a head  删除换行1 injury, or if the patient is taking anticoagulant medications, then a CT scan of the  删除换行1 head should be considered to exclude an intracranial bleed.

【15】2. It is important to emphasise that non-pharmacological methods of managing delirium, such as nursing patients in a quiet, dimly lit environment with continuity of  删除换行1 care from staff, is always preferable. Where patients are at risk of harming themselves or others and de-escalation techniques have failed, pharmacological management should be commenced.

【16】 Firstly, drugs that may exacerbate delirium, including psychoactive medications,  删除换行1 should need to be discontinued where possible. Secondly, drugs to treat agitation  删除换行1 may need to be prescribed. Administering a low dose, observing the effect and then  删除换行1 prescribing a further dose if needed is safer than starting with a higher dose.

【17】 Antipsychotic medications, such as haloperidol and olanzapine, are usually  删除换行1 the first-line therapy, although they can prolong the QT interval, and a baseline 

【18】ECG should therefore be reviewed prior to prescribing these drugs. Adverse effects  删除换行1 of antipsychotic medications also include extra-pyramidal symptoms and they  删除换行1 should thus be avoided in patients with Parkinson’s disease or Lewy body dementia. Benzodiazepines are generally accepted as the second-line agent of choice to  删除换行1 manage delirium and are particularly recommended for the treatment of delirium  删除换行1 tremens.王磊
