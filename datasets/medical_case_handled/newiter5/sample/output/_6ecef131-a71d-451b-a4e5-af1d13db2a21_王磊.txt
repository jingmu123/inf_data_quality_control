【0】CASE 63: JOINT PAINS, SKIN CHANGES AND MUSCLE WEAKNESS

【1】History

【2】A 44-year-old woman presents to the rheumatology department with a constellation of  删除换行1 symptoms. She was well until 8 months ago when she developed Raynaud’s phenomenon  删除换行1 and joint pains. The latter responded to a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID),  删除换行1 so she ‘got on with normal life’. Over the last few months she has noticed the skin over  删除换行1 her fingers becoming tighter. In recent weeks she has developed muscle weakness such  删除换行1 that she finds it difficult to climb stairs or get out of a chair unaided.

【3】Examination

【4】There is some skin tethering over the fingers, with reduction in the finger pulps. Although  删除换行1 her joints are painful there is no objective evidence of synovitis. Proximal muscle power  删除换行1 is reduced to 3/5. Respiratory examination reveals fine inspiratory crackles bibasally, but  删除换行1 the remainder of her examination is normal. The general practitioner who referred her  删除换行1 performed an ‘autoimmune screen’.

【5】INVESTIGATIONS

【6】ANA Positive

【7】Anti-dsDNA Negative

【8】Anti-Ro Negative

【9】Anti-La Negative

【10】Anti-Sm Negative

【11】Anti-U1-RNP Positive

【12】Polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia

【13】Questions

【14】• What is the likely diagnosis?

【15】• What further investigations might you initiate?

【16】• How would you manage this patient?

【17】ANSWER 63

【18】This female patient has presented with a combination of features seen in RA, SLE, myositis and scleroderma in the presence of anti-U1-RNP antibodies. The most likely diagnosis  删除换行1 is, therefore, mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD). Whether MCTD remains a truly distinct clinical entity is somewhat controversial and many patients may eventually develop  删除换行1 sufficient features to fulfil established diagnostic criteria of a particular autoimmune disease. The case presented here highlights the most common presenting features for MCTD:

【19】• joint symptoms

【20】• Raynaud’s phenomenon

【21】• sclerodactyly

【22】• proximal myopathy.

【23】Other frequent problems include oesophageal dysmotility, serositis and lymphadenopathy.

【24】Although respiratory involvement is common in MCTD, it is often asymptomatic. This  删除换行1 patient has fine bibasal crackles, which is suggestive of interstitial lung disease. She will  删除换行1 need a chest X-ray and possibly a high-resolution CT scan to identify interstitial changes,  删除换行1 as well as lung function studies to quantify any restrictive defect or reduced gas transfer  删除换行1 (diffusion capacity).

【25】Management of MCTD involves directing therapy at specific abnormalities. The treatment  删除换行1 for each clinical feature in the combination is identical to that for a given presentation  删除换行1 in isolation; for example, vasodilators for Raynaud’s phenomenon, hydroxychloroquine  删除换行1 for arthralgia, and corticosteroids for myositis. Over time, the inflammatory component  删除换行1 and severity of MCTD manifestations generally diminish. Pulmonary hypertension is the  删除换行1 leading cause of disease-associated death.

【26】KEY POINTS

【27】• Mixed connective tissue disease is characterized by the presence of anti-U1-RNP 

【28】antibodies.

【29】• Most common features of this mixed clinical picture are arthralgia, Raynaud’s  删除换行1 phenomenon, sclerodactyly and proximal myopathy.

【30】• Pulmonary hypertension is the most feared complication.
