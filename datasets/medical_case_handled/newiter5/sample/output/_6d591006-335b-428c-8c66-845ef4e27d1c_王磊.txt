【12】Case
----

【13】A 58-year-old male with a 2-year history of psoriasis and a 10-year history of HIV presented for follow-up care of his psoriasis. He was previously treated with methotrexate resulting in complete clearance of his skin but ultimately discontinued the medication due to liver enzyme elevation, diarrhea, and stomach ache. He was then started on apremilast but discontinued it due to inefficacy. He is unable to try phototherapy due to his work schedule. Review of systems was unremarkable, and the patient has no AIDS-defining conditions.

【14】On physical examination , there were several pink, round plaques with thick white scale on the bilateral upper and lower extremities. Approximately 3% of the BSA was affected.

【15】Based on the case description, which of the following is the best treatment for this patient?

【16】1.  1.
    Methotrexate
2.  2.
    Infliximab
3.  3.
    Cyclosporine
4.  4.
    Ustekinumab
5.  5.
    Acitretin

【17】Treatment
---------

【18】Acitretin

【19】Discussion
----------

【20】Skin diseases are among the most common manifestations of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Although the prevalence of psoriasis in the HIV-infected population is similar to that of the general population, psoriasis has a propensity to be more severe and treatment-refractory in patients with concomitant HIV 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 1 \]</u>. Psoriasis in HIV patients may also present at any degree of severity during any stage of the HIV infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 2 \]</u>. However, more severe psoriasis is correlated with worsening HIV-mediated immunosuppression. Psoriasis may be the first manifestation of HIV infection in some patients. Therefore, those with new-onset psoriasis may benefit from HIV testing 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 3 , 4 \]</u>. Psoriasis patients at risk for infection or with treatment-refractory disease may also benefit from HIV testing 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 5 \]</u>.

【21】Although HIV-infected patients may present with any subtype of psoriasis, the most common subtypes include plaque, guttate, inverse, and erythrodermic psoriasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 6 \]</u>. Multiple subtypes of psoriasis may be present in the same patient. HIV-positive psoriasis patients are more likely to have significant psoriatic arthritis when compared to HIV-negative psoriasis patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 6 \]</u>. Histological examination of skin specimens from HIV-infected psoriasis patients classically shows elevated plasma cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 4 \]</u>.

【22】Treatment of HIV-infected psoriasis patients poses a unique challenge, as HIV-associated psoriasis is paradoxically a T-lymphocyte mediated disease in the setting of T-lymphocyte depletion 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 6 \]</u>. Many psoriasis treatments are immunosuppressive and can potentially lead to severe complications in HIV patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 4 \]</u>. Interestingly, psoriasis may improve in HIV patients that begin antiretroviral therapy and replenish T-lymphocyte counts 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 3 \]</u>.

【23】Treatment
---------

【24】In general, HIV patients with psoriasis should be treated with agents that have minimal to no immunosuppressive properties, which limits the treatment options for these patients. First-line therapy for psoriasis with concomitant HIV includes phototherapy, which lacks systemic properties. Topical agents such as corticosteroids, vitamin D analogues , a combination of corticosteroids and vitamin D analogues (e.g. betamethasone dipropionate with calcipotriol), or topical calcineurin inhibitors may also be used as first-line therapy with or without phototherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 6 \]</u>. Based on the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, any HIV patient, regardless of CD4 count or the presence of an AIDS-defining illness, should start on antiretroviral therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 7 \]</u>. In addition to treating HIV, antiretroviral therapies have been shown to reduce the severity of psoriasis in HIV patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 6 \]</u>.

【25】If phototherapy , topical treatments , and antiretroviral therapies are unsuccessful in treating psoriasis patients with concomitant HIV, second-line treatments include acitretin , apremilast , TNF inhibitors , and ustekinumab 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 6 , 8 \]</u>. However, acitretin may interfere with some antiretroviral drugs. Apremilast, a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, is safe and well-tolerated in psoriasis patients with HIV. Side-effects of apremilast include nausea, diarrhea, weight loss, and upper respiratory tract infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 9 \]</u>.

【26】Biologic agents should be considered in HIV-positive psoriasis patients with refractory psoriasis or debilitating psoriatic arthritis. Specifically, ustekinumab and TNF inhibitors such as etanercept, adalimumab, and infliximab have been deemed safe and effective in psoriasis patients with concomitant HIV in multiple case studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 8 \]</u>. One case study found that etanercept treatment in a patient with HIV led to complete clearance of pustular psoriasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 10 \]</u>. In a case study of an HIV-positive psoriasis patient treated with IL-12/23 inhibitor ustekinumab, the patient tolerated the medication well, and his CD4 count increased from 429 cells/mL at baseline to 480 cells/mL 7 months after initiating ustekinumab 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 11 \]</u>.

【27】Methotrexate and cyclosporine should be avoided in psoriasis patients with concomitant HIV due to the risk of opportunistic infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 8 \]</u>. Methotrexate may worsen HIV disease severity and may also lead to leucopenia and opportunistic infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 12 \]</u>. Cyclosporine may inhibit activation of CD4 lymphocytes via calcineurin inhibition, which may theoretically be beneficial in HIV patients because T-cell activation is needed for HIV replication 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 13 \]</u>. A number of case reports found that cyclosporine was effective and tolerable in a psoriasis patient with concomitant HIV 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 14 \]</u>. However, further data supporting the use of cyclosporine in psoriasis with concomitant HIV is limited. Due its known immunosuppressive effects and limited literature supporting its use, cyclosporine should also be avoided in this population.

【28】Psoriasis patients with HIV treated with immunosuppressant medications should be managed in collaboration with infectious disease specialists for monitoring of CD4 counts and viral load and prevention of opportunistic infections. In some cases, infectious disease specialists may recommend prophylaxis to prevent opportunistic infections in these patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 13 \]</u>.

【29】Unfortunately, there are currently no randomized controlled trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of treatments for psoriasis with concomitant HIV. The evidence supporting the use of the aforementioned therapies consist mainly of case reviews and case reports.

【30】The patient was treated with acitretin and topical betamethasone dipropionate alternating with topical tacrolimus. At 3-month follow-up, the patient experienced improvement of his psoriasis lesions, and his total affected BSA was 1%.

【31】Key Points
----------

【32】   Psoriasis prevalence in HIV patients is similar to that of the general population. However, HIV patients with psoriasis may have more severe and treatment-refractory disease.
   All HIV patients should start antiretroviral therapy regardless of CD4+ count or presence of AIDS-defining illnesses.
   First-line treatments for psoriasis with concomitant HIV include phototherapy and topical therapies. Second-line treatments include TNF inhibitors, ustekinumab, acitretin, and apremilast.
   Methotrexate and cyclosporine should be avoided due to the risk of opportunistic infection.
