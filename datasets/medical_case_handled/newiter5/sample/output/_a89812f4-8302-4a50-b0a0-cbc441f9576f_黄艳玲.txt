【5】Investigations

【6】Previously, a doctor had ordered blood tests and a pelvic ultrasound with the following results.

【7】Patient result Follicular phase Mid-cycle peak Luteal phase

【8】FSH 5.8 IU/L 4–12 IU/L 6–25 IU/L 2–10 IU/L

【9】LH 19.7 IU/L 1–18 IU/L 20–90 IU/L 1–19 IU/L

【12】Thyroid function tests are normal

【13】HbA1c normal

【14】FSH, follicle-stimulating hormone; LH, luteinizing hormone.

【15】Pelvic ultrasound: The uterus is retroverted and measures 4.6 × 3.8 × 4.5 cm. The endometrial  删除换行1 lining has a smooth uniform echo texture and is 9 mm thick. The right ovary has a volume  删除换行1 of 14.5 mL and contains multiple cysts, more than 25, most of which are located within the  删除换行1 periphery of the ovary. The left ovary has a total of 16 cysts and a volume of just 12 mL.

【16】Questions

【17】• What is the patient’s diagnosis?

【18】• Which tests are needed to investigate her infertility?

【19】• How would you follow up your patient long term?

【20】ANSWER 36

【21】The patient suffers from polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The raised luteinizing hormone  删除换行1 (LH): follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) ratio approaching 3 and the raised free androgen  删除换行1 index are indicators of this condition. The ultrasound findings of the right ovary reach the  删除换行1 diagnostic criteria.

【22】Your patient has been tested thoroughly already. However, 30% of couples that have a fertility  删除换行1 problem have a multifactorial cause for this. The next step would be to do a sperm count of  删除换行1 her partner. If the sperm count is normal and they fail to conceive with first-line treatment,  删除换行1 tubal patency testing would be the next investigation.

【23】Patients with PCOS have an increased risk of developing diabetes with insulin resistance,  删除换行1 high blood pressure and high cholesterol later in life. Some doctors advocate annual blood  删除换行1 pressure, fasting blood glucose and lipid checks. Amenorrhoea owing to PCOS is also a risk  删除换行1 factor in developing uterine cancer in later life.

【24】Antenatal management includes rubella testing and starting her on folic acid in case she  删除换行1 becomes pregnant, as well as minimizing alcohol intake, reducing weight and doing a sensible amount of exercise, if she is not already doing this. Weight reduction and increasing  删除换行1 exercise levels appear to reduce the risk of associated disease as well as increasing fertility.

【25】• Problems with fertility can be extremely distressing for patients and their partners  删除换行1 and require a sensible and supportive response from general practitioners.

【26】• Lifestyle changes can be more efficacious than pharmacological therapy for many  删除换行1 diseases.
