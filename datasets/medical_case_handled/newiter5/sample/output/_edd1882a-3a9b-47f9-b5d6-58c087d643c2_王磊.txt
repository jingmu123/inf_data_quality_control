【0】Question: A 36-year-old man presents for his annual flu shot. He has been treated for hypertension with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor since age 30 years. He denies smoking and alcohol use. Family history is notable for his father requiring dialysis at age 50. An older brother recently underwent unilateral nephrectomy to decompress intra-abdominal organs. On examination, the patient appears barrel-chested and has a sitting blood pressure of 135/90 mm Hg. His likely genetic renal pathology is associated with an increased incidence of which of the following?

【1】> (A) Cerebral aneurysm

【2】> (B) Horseshoe kidney

【3】> (C) Macular cherry-red spots

【4】> (D) Potter syndrome

【5】> (E) Pott disease

【6】 Answer: The correct answer is A . Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is associated with berry aneurysms in the circle of Willis and with cyst formation not only in the kidneys but in the liver, pancreas, and spleen. Hypertension is a common early finding, with an average age at onset of 30 years. Later in the course, kidneys can reach sizes triple their normal volumes, often resulting in disabling symptoms due to pressure on intra-abdominal organs. ADPKD does not present at a young age. Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney (ARPKD) disease is diagnosed most often in pediatric patients; it is associated less often with cyst formation in multiple visceral organs and with the formation of berry aneurysms.  
Answer B is incorrect . Horseshoe kidney is associated with many renal diseases, but it does not involve the extra-renal findings described in the question.  
Answer C is incorrect . Children with inborn errors of metabolism can present with ophthalmologic findings such as cherry-red spots in the macula. An example is Niemann-Pick disease, a lysosomal storage disease in which a sphingomyelinase deficiency results in accumulation of sphingomyelin. The disease is characterized by varying degrees of splenomegaly and neurologic deficits.  
Answer D is incorrect . Potter syndrome is a condition involving renal agenesis, and it is not associated with any cystic changes.  
Answer E is incorrect . Pott disease is a TB infection of the vertebrae.王磊
