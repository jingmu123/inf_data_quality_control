=====================================================

【2】Introduction
------------

【3】Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) plays a very critical role in a wide range of cellular reactions. The conversion of NAD from its oxidized form ( NAD <sup><span class="bold">+ </span></sup> ) to its reduced form ( NADH ), and back, provides the cell with a mechanism for accepting and donating electrons. NAD <sup>+ </sup> /NADH plays a significant role in the reactions associated with glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, and fermentation. Given its importance to cell function, it would be useful if there were a means of visualizing NADH in living cells. The work presented in this case study introduces a new tool for research in cell metabolism – a NADH fluorescent sensor.

【4】▪ Conduct a search for an image of NAD <sup>+ </sup> . What part of the molecule is reduced in the conversion to NADH?

【5】▪ Outline the involvement of NAD <sup>+ </sup> / NADH in the following reactions:

【6】▪ Glycolysis

【7】▪ Fermentation

【8】▪ Citric acid cycle – Krebs cycle; TCA cycle

【9】▪ Mitochondrial electron transport

【10】▪ How does NADH move from the cytoplasm into the mitochondrial matrix?

【11】Background
----------

【12】A biosensor combines a biological component with a component that will respond to a physiological or chemical cue. The fluorescent biosensor developed for the study of intracellular NADH is a fusion of a NADH-sensitive protein to a fluorescent protein. The Rex protein is a NADH-sensitive transcription factor from the bacteria Bacillus subtilis . The Rex protein only responds to NADH and not to NAD <sup>+ </sup> or NADPH. The fluorescent component of the fusion protein is a circularly permuted yellow fluorescent protein ( cpYFP ). Like all fluorescent molecules, cpYFP absorbs light at one wavelength, the excitation wavelength , and emits light at a second lower wavelength, the emission wavelength . Linking cpYFP to a “sensor” protein means that its excitation/emission properties will change in response to changes in its environment; namely, binding of NADH by Rex. The researchers who developed this biosensor named it Frex (fluorescent Rex).

【13】▪ Suggest a reason a transcription factor would be sensitive to NADH levels.

【14】▪ Explain why a bacterial protein can be expressed in a eukaryotic cell.

【15】▪ Conduct a search to find the excitation/emission spectra for YFP.

【16】▪ Why is the emission wavelength always lower than the excitation wavelength for a fluorescent molecule?

【17】Methods
-------

【18】### Charactertization of Frex in vitro

【19】Purified Frex protein was stored at −20°C until use. Initial fluorescence levels were determined prior to the addition of any reagents. Reactions were initiated by the addition of the indicated nucleotides, and spectra were immediately recorded. For excitation experiments spectra were recorded with an excitation range from 300 nm to 515 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm. Readings were taken every 1 nm. For emission spectra the emission range was 510–600 nm with an excitation wavelength of 498 nm.

【20】### Cell culture 删除换行1 293FT cells were maintained in tissue culture media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37°C with 5% CO <sub>2 </sub> . Cells were plated in antibiotic-free high-glucose media 16 h before transfection.

【21】### Fluorescence microscopy

【22】For confocal fluorescence microscopy, cells were plated on 35 mm glass-bottomed dishes in growth media and observed for 24–30 h post transfection. Frex was expressed in different subcellular compartments by tagging it with organelle-specific signal peptides. Images were acquired using a laser scanning confocal microscope. For pseudocolor analysis the pixel-by-pixel ratio for a 488 nm excitation image by 405 nm excitation image of the same cell was determined. The purple (RGB value 255, 0, 255) was defined as the lowest ratio and red (RGB value 255, 0, 0) was defined as the highest ratio.

【23】### Live cell fluorescence measurements 删除换行1 293FT cells were harvested, trypsinized, and counted 24–48 h after transfection. Cells were washed and aliquots of cells were incubated at 37°C with different drugs. Fluorescence excited at 485 nm was measured using a microplate reader. Dual excitation ratios were obtained using excitation wavelengths of 410 and 500 nm and an emission wavelength of 528 nm. Fluorescence values were corrected by subtracting background fluorescence of cells not expressing Frex.

【24】▪ Conduct a search to learn more about 293FT cells.
