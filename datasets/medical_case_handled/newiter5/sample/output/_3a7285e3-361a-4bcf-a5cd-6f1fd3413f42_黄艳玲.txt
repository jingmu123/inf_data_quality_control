【0】CASE 51: TREATMENT FOR EATING DISORDERS

【1】Samantha is a 27-year-old who has suffered with anorexia nervosa since her teenage years.
She has had recurrent admissions to specialist eating-disorders units under Section 3 MHA,  删除换行1 and on a number of occasions has required feeding with a nasogastric tube against her  删除换行1 wishes. During each admission her weight would improve slightly, she would be discharged,  删除换行1 attend outpatient psychotherapy sessions, but subsequently relapse, lose weight and require  删除换行1 readmission.

【2】On this occasion she has been admitted with dangerously low electrolyte and glucose levels  删除换行1 due to her anorexia. She has a body mass index of just 13 and is critically unwell. She has  删除换行1 refused all treatment and therefore is being treated under Section 63 MHA. She initially had  删除换行1 a nasogastric tube inserted (requiring restraint and sedation for the insertion) but has subsequently pulled it out and is currently refusing further nasogastric feeding.

【3】The team is seeking advice as to whether they should continue to attempt nasogastric feeding  删除换行1 in her case.

【4】Questions

【5】• What is the justification for providing nasogastric feeding to patients with anorexia  删除换行1 without their consent?

【6】• What factors should be taken into account when making decisions around appropriateness of treatment in such cases?

【7】ANSWER 51

【8】Samantha has been admitted under Section 3 MHA. Her anorexia constitutes a ‘disorder or  删除换行1 disability of the mind’ and appropriate medical treatment is necessary for her own health  删除换行1 and safety. As she is refusing treatment (and such treatment can be provided only if she is  删除换行1 detained), an admission under Section 3 is necessary.

【9】Appropriate treatment which could be given to Samantha without her consent could include  删除换行1 psychotherapy and psychiatric medications but may also extend to nasogastric feeding.
‘Treatment’ as referred to in the MHA can include medical treatment for ‘alleviating, or preventing a worsening of, a mental disorder or one or more of its symptoms or manifestations’  删除换行1 删除10：<u>(MHA Code of Practice 2015)</u>. Nasogastric feeding in anorexic patients treats the physical  删除换行1 manifestations of their mental disorder (i.e. treats the malnutrition which results from the  删除换行1 patient’s lack of food intake). It may also maintain and improve their physical health enough  删除换行1 to allow them to gain the cognitive ability to participate in psychological therapies, and  删除换行1 weight gain may even be psychologically therapeutic in itself.
Samantha should be treated in accordance with her best interests. However, these are difficult  删除换行1 to determine. Both possible courses of action here – deciding not to give Samantha nasogastric feeding, or alternatively forcing her to have nasogastric feeding against her will – have the  删除换行1 potential to result in harm. Deciding not to provide feeding could result in her death, which  删除换行1 would fail to give appropriate weight to the sanctity of life principle. On the other hand,  删除换行1 forcing Samantha to have nasogastric feeding fails to respect her autonomy, and whilst her  删除换行1 ability to make autonomous decisions may be adversely affected by her mental illness, there  删除换行1 is still an inherent moral good in taking into account her wishes. Additionally, the need for  删除换行1 physical restraint could amount to inhuman and degrading treatment contravening Article 3  删除换行5 ECHR, although this is unlikely if it can be convincingly shown to be a therapeutic necessity.

【10】Although Samantha has a mental illness, it is important that the doctors still involve her in  删除换行1 decisions regarding her care as much as possible. The views of her family and friends may be  删除换行1 valuable, particularly given the support she may require from them during her treatment.
Furthermore, the likely success of the various treatment options should be considered, as this  删除换行1 will be important in assessing whether the proposed benefits are sufficiently great to justify  删除换行1 the potential harms that may be associated with each treatment option.

【11】Key Points

【12】• Nasogastric feeding is recognised as a potential treatment that may be enforced  删除换行1 under Section 63 MHA for patients with eating disorders.

【13】• The appropriateness of enforced nasogastric feeding must be considered. Factors  删除换行1 such as the patient’s wishes, previous treatments, the need for restraint and the  删除换行1 patient’s prognosis should be taken into account.黄艳玲
