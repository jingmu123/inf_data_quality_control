【6】Case
----

【7】A 15-year-old female with generalized atopic dermatitis is referred for phototherapy. In the past, her atopic dermatitis was manageable with topical agents alone, but recently, it has generalized to the trunk and all extremities and topical agents are no longer adequate to control her disease. Furthermore, the atopic dermatitis now also involves her face where mild topical steroids have also been inadequate. On examination, typical erythematous, eczematous lesions are observed scattered over the trunk and extremities. There are also patchy areas of excoriations and lichenification. The periorbital region, antecubital fossae and popliteal fossae are also involved. The patient reports that her skin is easily aggravated by various materials she comes in contact with such as wool clothing, soap, and even some moisturizing lotions.

【8】Because of the chronic hyper-irritability of her skin, which is not at all unusual in the atopic dermatitis population, the patient is started on a conservative dose of BB-UVB phototherapy. Her face is also treated while wearing proper eye protection. Despite initiating phototherapy at low dose with precaution, she experiences of symptoms of mild sunburn, and therefore, the dose of BB-UVB is decreased further. After approximately 2 weeks, small increments in dosimetry are attempted and tolerated well. After 3 to 4 weeks, the patient is able to tolerate the usual dosing protocol per her skin type 删除25：<u></u>, and her skin greatly improves along with the pruritus. The patient is instructed to continue using topical steroids and non-steroids focally on the lesions while largely maintaining with BB-UVB phototherapy.

【9】Discussion
----------

【10】Phototherapy is a second-line treatment option for atopic dermatitis recalcitrant to topical therapies 删除33：<u></u> 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 1 \]</u>. Table 24.1 shows the recommended use of phototherapy for the treatment of atopic dermatitis per the American Academy of Dermatology. Phototherapy is advantageous in that there are no internal side effects as opposed to systemic treatments for atopic dermatitis such as prednisone, methotrexate, azathioprine, and mycophenolate mofetil. NB-UVB, BB-UVB, PUVA, and excimer laser can all be effective for treatment of atopic dermatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 2 , 3 \]</u>. The recommended protocols to treat patients with atopic dermatitis are similar to that of psoriasis patients as discussed in Chap. 1 for UVB phototherapy, Chap. 2 for PUVA, and Chap. 3 for excimer laser, although atopic dermatitis patients can be treated slightly more conservatively due to the hyper-irritability of their skin . Furthermore, as discussed in Chap. 4 , the Goeckerman regimen is also very effective for severe, recalcitrant, generalized atopic dermatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 4 \]</u>.

| Phototherapy is a second line treatment, after failure of first-line treatment (emollients, topical steroids, and topical calcineurin inhibitors). |
| --- |
| Phototherapy can be used as maintenance therapy in patients with chronic disease. |
| Phototherapy treatment of all forms should be under the guidance and ongoing supervision of a physician knowledgeable in phototherapy techniques. |
| The light modality chosen should be guided by factors such as availability, cost, patient skin type, skin cancer history, patient use of photosensitizing medications, etc. |
| The dosing and scheduling of light should be based upon minimal erythema dose (MED) and/or Fitzpatrick skin type. |
| Home phototherapy under the direction of a physician may be considered for patients who are unable to receive phototherapy in an office setting. |

【16】Although there is no single phototherapy modality that is clearly superior in terms of efficacy, it has been shown that natural sunlight is likely less effective than artificial light sources 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 5 \]</u>. In the authors’ experience, BB-UVB appears to work notably better for patients with atopic dermatitis as BB-UVB appears to be less irritating as compared to NB-UVB in this patient population. Patients with idiopathic, generalized pruritus, many of who are elderly, also appear to tolerate BB-UVB better. Therefore, at the UCSF Phototherapy Unit, BB-UVB is recommended first for patients with atopic dermatitis or chronic idiopathic pruritus.

| 1–7 days | Increase dose per protocol |

| 12–20 days | Decrease by 25% |
| 21–27 days | Decrease by 50% |
| 28 or more days | Restart with initial dose |

【18】As discussed on in Chap. 7 on “inititation burn”, it is not uncommon for patients with atopic dermatitis to experience irritation and even frank sunburn from a very low dose of UV light. This is because the skin of atopic dermatitis patients is chronically hyper-irritable with or without obvious eczematoid lesions, that they can even be irritated initially by light. However, in most cases, unless it is a case of severe photosensitive eczema, the skin is capable of “getting used to” the light with persistence and gentle modulation of dosimetry 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 6 \]</u>. Since UVB phototherapy is one of the safest therapeutic options available to help maintain atopic dermatitis skin under good control long term, it is a shame to give up on this modality as soon as the patient complains of initial irritation. Therefore, it is important to be able to figure out how to make phototherapy work for atopic dermatitis patients who may have very sensitive skin.

【19】In this patient with generalized atopic dermatitis uncontrolled on topical therapies, UVB phototherapy is a good option provided that it is started very carefully, monitoring for initiation burn or light-induced irritability. Due to involvement of her face, the face can be exposed during phototherapy, but proper precautions should be taken with eye protection 删除33：<u></u>. The patient should commit to 3 times per week treatment sessions for at least 12 weeks, followed by ongoing treatments at least once weekly for maintenance therapy long-term. Concomitant use of topical therapies, including topical corticosteroids, non-steroid topical therapies (tacrolimus, pimecrolimus), and topical tar, are encouraged (but not on the skin during actual phototherapy sessions) in addition to a gentle skin care regimen consisting of frequent moisturizing and avoidance of triggers.
