【0】#### Research involving prisoners

【1】##### Why are prisoners <sup>a </sup> vulnerable?

【2】Prisoners are not a homogenous group. Statistically, they include a higher percentage of members from other vulnerable groups, such as the poor, illiterate, mentally ill, and – in many countries – foreigners who do not understand or speak the local language sufficiently to understand explanations regarding research.

【3】As a group, prisoners are vulnerable due to their particular situation: being detained and therefore being deprived of the freedom to move freely, which implies that they are, possibly, under the influence of different kinds of pressures. Several prison-related factors are relevant for ethical considerations about research involving prisoners.

【4】First, prisoners are vulnerable because they have limited choices: they cannot freely choose and consult their own physician. Their access to healthcare depends on the available health structures. Prisoners might not have access to alternative healthcare or adequate and independent clinical advice when a research study is carried out in a prison.

【5】Second, prisoners are vulnerable because the pressures from prison officers and co-detainees, as well as pressures resulting from their living conditions, could interfere with free informed consent. Prisoners might accept participation in research because they fear punishment if they do not participate. Hierarchical structures are strong among prison inmates and leaders might force others to participate or, on the contrary, could force inmates not to participate. Prisoners are also vulnerable to real or perceived incentives to become a research subject, especially if they think that participation could be advantageous because research subjects obtain better living conditions or shorter prison terms than other prisoners.

【6】Among ethics scholars and researchers, controversy exists as to whether prisoners should be considered competent to give informed consent. At one extreme are those who, based on the principle of beneficence, claim that, since studies are lacking which prove prisoners’ capacity to give truly informed consent, one should not let them decide on their own. At the other extreme is the opinion that prisoners should not be treated differently from other potential research subjects, since their mental faculties are not fundamentally changed by detention. A part of this question is empirical: there has been insufficient exploration of whether prisoners have a tendency to make different decisions while in prison from those they would make if they were not detained. A second argument refers to the right to respect autonomy: being deprived of liberty does not include deprivation of the autonomy to decide about one’s body and healthcare-related issues. Treating prisoners, by definition, as incompetent concerning health-related matters is a violation of their human rights.

【7】###### What follows from the vulnerability of prisoners for research ethics?

【8】The vulnerability of prisoners has triggered various strategies for their protection against research risks and abuse.通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>16,17 </sup></u> Strategies are used either alone or cumulatively by different guidelines and legislations.

【9】The first is characterized by different forms of restrictions. The most extreme form is general prohibition of all forms of research with prisoners as is the case in some of the US. Others, such as US federal regulations, allow only certain categories of research to be carried out with prisoners. Categories are allowed either because they imply only minimal risk or because their benefits are particularly important and outweigh the (limited) risks.通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>18 </sup></u> The Council of Europe varies restrictions according to the type of benefit. It restricts only research that does not promise direct benefit to prisoners. If research is expected to produce indirect benefit, i.e. benefit only to prisoners as a group, it is allowed only if three conditions are fulfilled: “(i) Research of comparable effectiveness cannot be carried out without the participation of persons deprived of liberty; (ii) The research has the aim of contributing to the ultimate attainment of results capable of conferring benefit to persons deprived of liberty; (iii) The research entails only minimal risk and minimal burden”. Research without at least indirect benefit is prohibited.通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>16,17</sup></u>

【10】A second strategy is to require higher efforts than with nonprisoners to assure informed consent and freedom of choice. This could imply that prisoners should be informed several times and particular tests could be indicated to ensure that they have understood the information. It could also mean to provide prisoners with more time than nonprisoners to consider their decisions. Most regulations prohibit incentives in the form of money or better living conditions or influence on prison terms. Other means to ensure that prisoners’ choices are in line with their best medical interest is to grant them access to an independent and qualified doctor who is not part of the research team who could advise prisoner patients impartially.

【11】A third strategy is to increase oversight mechanisms by research ethics committees (RECs) or ERCs. <sup>b </sup> In the US, for example, ERCs that approve research with prisoners need to have a particular composition including a prisoner representative who has experience with prison healthcare. RECs should receive clear indications how to evaluate specific ethical issues concerning research with prisoners such as the principle of subsidiarity and issues of distributive justice: prisoners should not bear a disproportionate burden of research risks, and research should be carried out inside prisons only if results of comparable efficiency and meaning cannot be obtained with nonprisoners. Stricter oversight mechanisms might include the obligation to visit the prison before, during, and after the study to control whether confidentiality, informed consent, and other ethical requirements are respected.

【12】A fourth strategy is to require special ethical training for researchers carrying out research with prisoners to assure that they are aware of ethical issues and specific risks related to research with prisoners, and engage themselves in the protection of prisoners from abuse through research.

【13】Such strategies are important to protect prisoners from the risk of abuse, and preferable to their exclusion from research entirely. Empirical studies inside prisons can be beneficial and are necessary to obtain evidence-based answers to some research questions that need to be addressed in order to improve prisoners’ healthcare.

【14】#### Key points

【15】• With children, prisoners, and other vulnerable populations, the challenge is to find the right balance between protection from abuse and the need to grant vulnerable populations access to participation in research.

【16】• Although the exclusion of vulnerable subjects from a specific study will sometimes be an appropriate way to minimize their risk of being wronged in the conduct of research, this will not always be true.

【17】• Studies designed to address health problems specific to a vulnerable population are needed to improve care for this very population, and often cannot be conducted on others.

【18】• Participation in research can hold a prospect of benefit from which it is sometimes wrong to exclude vulnerable persons. In such cases, enrollment with special protections tailored to the sort of wrong to be avoided is ethically preferable to exclusion.

【19】Notes 删除换行1 a In this text, the term “prisoner” is meant to include any kind of detained person, in any kind of detention facility. The term prison is used in its British meaning all kinds of detention facilities, such as jails, federal prisons or other places of detention.

【20】b Institutional review boards (terminology used in the US). In this chapter we do not make any difference between the terminology: both REC and IRB refers to the competent body of research oversight in a given country.
