【0】Question: 45.1 A 55-year-old man with congestive heart failure develops bilateral pleural effusions. Which of the following is the most likely pleural fluid characteristic if thoracentesis is performed?

【1】A. Pleural fluid LDH 39, LDH ratio 0.2, protein ratio 0.7

【2】B. Pleural fluid LDH 39, LDH ratio 0.2, protein ratio 0.1

【3】C. Pleural fluid LDH 599, LDH ratio 0.9, protein ratio 0.1

【4】D. Pleural fluid LDH 599, LDH ratio 0.9, protein ratio 0.7

【5】Answer: 45.1 B. Congestive heart failure is commonly associated with bilateral pleural effusions, which are transudative, as a consequence of alteration of Starling forces. The effusions of heart failure are best managed by treating the heart failure, for example, with diuretics, and typically do not require thoracentesis.

【6】Question: 45.2 A 39-year-old man develops a moderate free-flowing pleural effusion following a left lower lobe pneumonia. Thoracentesis reveals straw-colored fluid with gram-positive diplococci on Gram stain, pH 6.9, glucose 32 mg/dL, and LDH 1890. Which of the following is the best next step?

【7】A. Send the fluid for culture.

【8】B. Continue treatment with antibiotics for pneumococcal infection.

【9】C. Tube thoracostomy to drain the effusion.

【10】D. Schedule a follow-up chest x-ray in 2 weeks to document resolution of the effusion.

【11】Answer: 45.2 C. The positive Gram stain, low pH, low glucose, and markedly elevated LDH all suggest that this parapneumonic effusion is “complicated,” that is, it is unlikely to resolve with antibiotic therapy and is likely to produce loculated pockets of pus, which will require surgical intervention. Drainage by serial thoracentesis or tube thoracostomy is essential.

【12】Question: 45.3 A 69-year-old man complains of gradually worsening dyspnea and a nagging cough over the past 3 months but no fevers. He is found to have a right-sided pleural effusion, which is tapped and is grossly bloody. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

【13】A. Parapneumonic effusion

【14】B. Malignancy in the pleural space

【15】C. Rupture of aortic dissection into the pleural space

【16】D. Pulmonary embolism with pulmonary infarction
Answer: 45.3 B. The most common causes of hemorrhagic pleural effusion are malignancy, pulmonary embolism, and tuberculosis. Pulmonary embolism would be suggested by acute onset of dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain rather than this subacute presentation. Similarly, aortic rupture can produce a hemothorax but would have an acute presentation with pain and hemodynamic compromise.

【17】CLINICAL PEARLS

【18】 Transudative effusions meet none of the following criteria (exudative effusions meet at least one): (a) Pleural fluid protein/serum protein ratio more than 0.5. (b) Pleural fluid LDH/serum LDH ratio more than 0.6. (c) Pleural fluid LDH greater than two-thirds normal serum LDH.

【19】 Tube thoracostomy or more aggressive drainage of parapneumonic effusion usually is required with gross pus (empyema), positive Gram stain or culture, glucose less than 60 mg/dL, pH less than 7.10, and loculations.

【20】 The most common cause of pleural effusion is congestive heart failure, which typically gives bilateral symmetric transudative effusions and is best treated with diuresis.

【21】 The most common causes of bloody pleural effusion (in the absence of trauma) are malignancy, pulmonary embolism with infarction, and tuberculosis.
