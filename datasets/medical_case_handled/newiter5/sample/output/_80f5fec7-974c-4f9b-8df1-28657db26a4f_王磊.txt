【0】Case 37

【1】A 12-year-old boy is brought to the physicians office with right thigh pain and a limp. His mother has noticed him limping for the past week or so. He denies any injury to his leg but says that it hurts some when he plays basketball with his friends. He denies back pain， hip pain， or ankle pain. He occasionally gets some pain in the right knee but does not have any swelling orbruising. He has no signifi-cant medical history， does not take any medications regularly， and otherwise feels fine. On examination，he is an overweight adolescent. His vital signs and a general physical examination are normal. When you have him walk， he has a prominent limp. You note that he seems to keep his weight on his left leg for a greater propor-tion ofhis gait cycle than he does on the right leg. Examination ofhis back reveals a full range of motion， no tenderness， and no muscle spasm. He gets pain in the right hip when it is passively internally rotated. When the hip is passively flexed， there is a noticeable external rotation. There is no thigh muscle atrophy. His right knee and the remainder of his orthopedic examination are normal.

【5】37：Summary： An overweight 12-year-old boy presents for evaluation of a limp and thigh pain. There is no history of injury or trauma. He is found to have pain on internal rotation of the hip and his hip externally rotates when passively flexed. He bears weight more on his left leg than his right while walking.1\. Develop a differential diagnosis of the most likely causes of leg pain and limp-ing in children.

【6】2\. Know common causes of leg pain and limping in children of different ages.

【7】3\. Know appropriate examination， laboratory， and radiologic evaluation for the limping child.To understand a limp， it is first important to understand the normal gait. Gait is composed oftwo phases： the"swing"and the"stance"phases. The stance phase is the weight-bearing phase and accounts for approximately 60%ofthe gait cycle. The swing phase is the non-weight-bearing phase， when the foot lifts off the ground and is propelled forward. The antalgic gait occurs when the stance phase of gait is shortened on the side of pain， usually because of pain during weight bearing. Antalgic gait is the most common type of limp and is the type of gait described in this case.As always， the initial approach should include a good focused history and physi-cal. The clinician should ask questions about recent trauma， onset， and duration of limp， recent illnesses (viral， pharyngitis， rashes， tick bites， diarrhea， urethritis). Past medical history， previous levels of function， and family history of musculoskel-etal disorders can help with diagnosis. Associated symptoms like fever， weight loss， anorexia， or pain are especially important. A key characteristic in the evaluation of the child with a limp is assessing whether there is pain or no pain. In an antalgic gait， the cause of the pain may range from the back to the foot . Therefore， unless there is an obvious source of pain， the examination should include assessment of the back， pelvis， buttock， leg， and foot. In the child who clings to the parent， separating the child from the parent will allow the clinician to observe the child’s gait when they walk back to the parent. The child who walks stiffly may be avoiding moving the spine indicating a possible discitis. Those with nonantalgic gait abnormalities (Trendelenburg gait， inability to dorsiflex the foot， locked knees， toe walking) can have congenital， neurologic， or limb length disor-ders. Inspecting the feet may show clawing of the toes or cavus deformity， which are signs of neuromuscular conditions.

【8】Because hip pathology often presents with vague pain and hip conditions are likely to need emergent treatment， evaluation of the hip may be the most important part of the examination of a patient in whom the site of pathology is not immediately obvious. Restricted internal rotation appears to be the most sensitive marker of hip pathology in children， followed by a lack of abduction. Internal rotation of the hip increases the intracapsular pressure within the acetabulum. Pain during a leg roll (supine child with extended hip and knee； one examiner stabilizes the pel-vis while another rolls leg internally and externally) and limited internal rotation of less than 30 degrees may indicate infectious or orthopedic hip pathology. The FABER test (Flexion， ABduction， External Rotation-the ipsilateral ankle placed

An ultrasound of the hip is more sensitive for an effusion of the hip and can be considered. In nonverbal children， x-rays from hip to feet can find a fracture in a significant minority of children with limp. A complete blood count(CBC) should be drawn if there is concern of an infection， inflammatory arthritis， or malignancy. An erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein(CRP) should be considered in evaluating infectious and rheumatologic etiologies. Consider Lyme disease in endemic areas， as this can mimic both infectious and rheumatologic causes of hip disorders. If there was a recent pharyngitis， consider antistreptolysin (ASO) titers. In teens with history of urethritis or febrile diarrhea， consider urine chlamydial antigens or stool cultures for possible Reiter syndrome. Any joint where septic arthritis is considered should have a joint aspiration and evaluation of synovial fluid. Fever greater than 99.5F and ESR greater than 20 is

【11】The evaluation of limping without pain  should include measure-ments for leg length discrepancies (measure umbilicus to medial malleolus) and observation for muscular atrophy or limb deformity. Barlow (hip and knee flexed90 degrees， hold the knee and attempt to displace the thigh posterior)， Ortolani(guided abduction)，and Galeazzi (knee height discrepancy when patient lies supine with ankles to buttocks and hips and knees flexed) tests can be used to assess for congenital hip abnormalities and femoral length discrepancies.Common causes of limping in children in this age group are septic arthritis， frac-tures， and complications of congenital hip dysplasia. Septic arthritis is usually monoarticular and associated with systemic signs such as fever. In young infants， the symptoms may be less obvious， such as crying， irritability， and poor feeding. Children who are ambulatory (crawlers or walkers) will often refuse to do anything that puts weight on the affected joint because of pain. Infection of a joint causes a septic effusion， which raises the pressure inside of the joint capsule. Children with a septic hip joint will often lay with their hip flexed，abducted， and externally rotated， which helps to reduce the pain， and they will have significant pain with any internal rotation or extension of the joint. Children with a septic joint will usually have an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count，ESR， and CRP. Definitive diagnosis comes from joint aspiration. Any suspected septic joint must be aspirated. In younger infants (4 months or younger)， group B Streptococcus and Staphylococcus aureus are the most common pathogens involved. In older infants and children under the age of 5， S aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes are the usual causes. Treatment is urgent surgical irrigation and debridement， along with antibiotics.

【12】Unsuspected fractures—either stress fractures or traumatic fractures—can present with pain and limping. Abuse must be suspected if the injury is inconsis-tent with the history presented， ifthe history changes with repeated questioning， if the child is said to have performed an act outside of his developmental ability， or if a fracture usually associated with abuse is found 删除25：<u></u>.

may not reveal the source of the injury， as a child may fall outside of the view of the parent 删除25：<u></u>. A traumatic injury may not result in limping or in complete immobility， but may cause a change in how the child ambulates. For example， a child who previously walked and now refuses to walk but will crawl， may have an injury of the lower leg or foot.Transient synovitis is a self-limited inflammatory response that is a common cause of hip pain in children. It occurs typically in children ages 3 to 10， is more common in boys than in girls， and often follows a viral infection. It is frequently seen as gradu-ally increasing hip pain that results in a limp or refusal to walk. These children have a low-grade or no fever， a normal W BC count， and a normal ESR. On examination， there is pain with internal rotation of the hip and the overall range of motion is limited by pain. X-rays are either normal or show some nonspecific swelling. In a situation where the patient is afebrile， has pain-free rotation of hip greater than30 degrees， has a normal W BC count， normal ESR， CRP， and short-term follow-up can be assured， the patient can be followed clinically and should improve in a few days. If these conditions are not met and the diagnosis of a septic joint is considered， or if a patient followed expectantly continues to worsen， an aspiration should be done. Kocher criteria are often utilized to assess risk for septic arthritis 删除换行1 in children. The four criteria are fever greater than 101.3F (38.5℃)，non-weight-bearing， ESR greater than 40， W BC count greater than 12，000. Z ero criteria pres-ent equals less than 0.2% risk， one criteria is 3%， two criteria is 40%， three criteria is 93%， and four criteria is almost 100% chance of septic arthritis. A septic joint will have a purulent aspirate with a WBC count greater than 50，000/pL； transient synovi-tis will have a yellow/ clear aspirate with a lower WBC count (<10，000/pL).

【14】Legg-Calve-Perthes (LCP) disease is an avascular necrosis of the femoral head that typically occurs in children ages 4 to 8. It is much more common in boys than in girls. Any disruption of blood flow to the femoral capital epiphysis， such as trauma or infection， may cause avascular necrosis. In LCP disease， the etiology of the disruption of blood flow is unknown. Children typically have a gradual onset of hip，thigh， or knee pain， and limping over a few months. Early in the course， x-rays of the hip may appear normal. Later radiographic findings include collapse， flatten-ing， and widening of the femoral head. Bone scans or magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis. The treatment is usually conser-vative， with protection of the joint and efforts to maintain range of motion. Chil-dren who develop more severe necrosis or who develop the disease at older ages may have a worse outcome and a higher risk of developing degenerative arthritis.The capital femoral epiphysis is the growth plate that connects the metaphysis(femoral head) to the diaphysis (shaft of the femur). A slipped capital femoral epiphysis is a separation of this growth plate， which results in the femoral head being medially and posteriorly displaced. This may be caused by an acute injury， but more often is not. It is most often seen in overweight adolescent boys and presents as pain in the hip， thigh， or knee along with a limp. Examination reveals limited internal rotation and obligate external rotation when the hip is passively flexed. Early x-rays may show only widening of the epiphysis； later x-rays can show the slippage of the femoral head in relation to the femoral neck. The treatment is surgical pin-ning of the femoral head. These patients must be closely followed， as approximately20% to 50% will develop avascular necrosis and 33% will develop SCFE in the contralateral hip.

【15】Other causes of limb pain are common in adolescents. Sprains， strains， and over-use injuries are the most common cause of limb pain in this population， and are usually readily diagnosed on history and examination 删除25：<u></u>. Sexually active adolescents or teens are at risk for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and their complications， including gonococcal arthritis. In this population， an appropriate history， sexual history， and review of systems are necessary.Septic arthritis， fractures， neuromuscular disorders， and neoplasms can cause a limp in children of all ages. Night sweats， anorexia， weight loss， and pain that wak-ens the child at night are suspicious for malignancy. “Growing pains"is a diagnosis of exclusion. It should be considered if the pain is only at night， is bilateral， is not present during the day， and if no other pathology is found.王磊
