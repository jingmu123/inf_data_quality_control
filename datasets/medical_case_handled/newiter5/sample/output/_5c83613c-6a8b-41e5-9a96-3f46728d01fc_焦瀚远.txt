【0】CASE 99: A BREATHLESS PATIENT WITH DERMATOMYOSITIS

【1】History

【2】A 45-year-old woman has been admitted to the rheumatology ward with a diagnosis of  删除换行1 dermatomyositis. She is profoundly weak (muscle power 2/5 in all proximal groups) and  删除换行1 on admission received a pulse of intravenous methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide.
She remains on 60 mg prednisolone orally, bone protection and thromboprophylaxis. Ten  删除换行1 days after admission her muscle strength has not improved and the senior house officer  删除换行1 is asked to review her as she has become acutely more breathless.

【3】Examination

【4】This woman appears exhausted and unwell with marked peripheral myopathy. She has a  删除换行1 temperature of 37.8°C and her oxygen saturation is 88 per cent on room air. Her pulse  删除换行1 rate is 92/min and blood pressure 125/86 mmHg. Her jugular venous pulse (JVP) is not  删除换行1 elevated and her heart sounds are normal with no peripheral oedema or evidence of deep  删除换行1 venous thrombosis. She is short of breath at rest (20 breaths per minute) with reduced  删除换行1 chest wall movements bilaterally. Her right mid-zone is dull to percussion with increased  删除换行1 vocal resonance. There are mild crackles throughout which clear with coughing.

【5】Questions

【6】• What is the differential diagnosis of breathlessness in this patient?

【7】• What are the appropriate investigations?

【8】• How would you manage her?

【9】ANSWER 99

【10】Patients with severe muscle weakness have several reasons for breathlessness. The main  删除换行1 differential diagnoses to consider are:

【11】• ventilatory failure due to respiratory muscle weakness

【12】• pneumonia, including due to aspiration and particularly in those who have received  删除换行1 immunosuppression

【13】• interstitial lung disease

【14】• pulmonary embolus due to immobility.

【15】The clinical features in this case (fever and findings consistent with pneumonia), on a  删除换行1 background of profound immunosuppression, would make pneumonia the most likely  删除换行1 explanation for her deterioration. Infection is a significant problem in this patient population: respiratory muscle weakness may lead to atelectasis and collapse which increase  删除换行1 the risk of infection. In addition, her orophayngeal muscles may be involved, leading to  删除换行1 aspiration. Although interstitial lung disease occurs in 5–10 per cent of dermatomyositis  删除换行1 patients, it typically develops more insidiously and presents with late or pan-inspiratory  删除换行1 crackles that do not clear with coughing (such clearing would be more suggestive of  删除换行1 transmitted sounds from upper airway secretions). Although she is on thromboprophylaxis which reduces the chance of pulmonary embolus and there is no history of pleuritic  删除换行1 chest pain or haemoptysis and her JVP is normal, thromboembolism should always be  删除换行1 considered.

【16】Appropriate immediate investigations include:

【17】• arterial blood gas to assess respiratory failure

【18】• blood cultures to assess for infection

【19】• chest X-ray looking for features of bronchopneumonia, collapse or interstitial lung  删除换行1 disease

【20】• spirometry to assess reduction in vital capacity.

【21】It would be appropriate to commence broad-spectrum antibiotics intravenously to cover  删除换行1 for aspiration and nosocomial infection (advice should be sought from local microbiology  删除换行1 services). She should receive chest physiotherapy to help clear secretions and reduce the  删除换行1 risk of lobar collapse. These patients may deteriorate rapidly and early review by respiratory and intensive care teams is appropriate.

【22】KEY POINTS

【23】• The differential diagnosis of breathlessness in patients with dermatomyositis includes  删除换行1 infection, ventilatory failure, interstitial lung disease and thromboembolism.

【24】• Chest physiotherapy is central to management and should be instituted early.

【25】• Seek advice from respiratory and intensive care teams promptly.
