【0】Question: A 32-year-old man recently underwent a liver transplant and was prescribed cyclosporine to reduce the chance of immune rejection. After a few weeks of taking the drug, he started experiencing acute pain, tenderness, warmth, and swelling of his right great toe. His physician takes a fluid sample from the affected area. Examination of the contents reveals the presence of intracellular crystals. Which of the following medications would prevent this problem from recurring?

【1】> (A) Allopurinol

【2】> (B) Calcitonin

【3】> (C) Collagenase

【4】> (D) Furosemide

【5】> (E) Warfarin

【6】 Answer: The correct answer is A . The main adverse reactions to cyclosporine therapy are renal dysfunction, tremor, hirsutism, hypertension, and gum hyperplasia. Cyclosporine can damage renal tubules irreversibly, thus decreasing the kidney’s ability to excrete potentially toxic metabolites. This patient is suffering from acute gouty arthritis secondary to impaired renal excretion of uric acid and thus increased serum levels of urate, which can precipitate as monosodium urate crystals in joints. Gout classically presents with a warm, red, painful joint. The most common joint affected in gout is the great toe. Other potential adverse effects of cyclosporine that occur secondary to renal failure include hyperkalemia, hypophosphatemia, hypomagnesemia, hypercalciuria, and metabolic acidosis. Allopurinol is used to prevent gouty arthritis by inhibiting xanthine oxidase, an enzyme involved in uric acid synthesis. The mainstay of therapy for acute gout is nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and corticosteroids.  
Answer B is incorrect . Calcitonin counteracts the action of parathyroid hormone (PTH), thus reducing serum calcium level. Whereas cyclosporine is known to cause hypercalciuria, it is not associated with the formation and precipitation of calcium pyrophosphate crystals in joints and connective tissues, also known as pseudogout. The development of pseudogout is associated with joint trauma, familial chondrocalcinosis, hemochromatosis, and certain other metabolic or endocrine disorders. Thus calcitonin would not prevent acute gouty arthritis.  
Answer C is incorrect . Collagenase is an enzyme involved in collagen degradation. It is key to pathogenesis of various bacteria, but it also can be induced during an immune response and lead to indirect tissue damage. Cyclosporine does not affect collagen turnover in joints. Collagenase would not counteract the effects of cyclosporine and should not lead to deposition of crystals in joint fluid.  
Answer D is incorrect . Furosemide is a loop diuretic used in treatment of congestive heart failure and acute renal failure. Loop diuretics may be used to increase calcium diuresis in hypercalcemic states. However, loop diuretics are known to cause hyperuricemia, which may precipitate gout in some patients and should be avoided in this patient specifically.  
Answer E is incorrect . Warfarin is an anticoagulant that inhibits vitamin K-dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X. Neither elevated uric acid levels nor cyclosporine itself predisposes patients to thrombus formation; therefore antithrombotic therapy is unnecessary.苏锦恭
