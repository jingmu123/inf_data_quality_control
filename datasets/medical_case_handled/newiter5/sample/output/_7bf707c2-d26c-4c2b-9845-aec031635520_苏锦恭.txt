【0】Question: A 31-year-old woman with newly diagnosed tuberculosis is begun on a standard treatment regimen. During a follow-up appointment, it is noted as she walks into the room that her gait is markedly unsteady. Physical examination is notable for decreased sensation over the upper and lower extremities. Which of the following drugs is most likely causing this patient’s symptoms?

【1】> (A) Ethambutol

【2】> (B) Isoniazid

【3】> (C) Levofloxacin

【4】> (D) Pyrazinamide

【5】> (E) Rifampin

【6】 Answer: The correct answer is B . This patient presents to her appointment exhibiting ataxia and paresthesias, signs of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) deficiency in a patient taking isoniazid. Pyridoxine is the precursor to the coenzyme pyridoxal phosphate, and isoniazid, which is used to treat tuberculosis (TB), inhibits pyridoxine. Pyridoxine plays a role in neurotransmitter production and the conversion of tryptophan to niacin (vitamin B3 ). Patients taking isoniazid without supplemental vitamin B6 can develop neuropathy as well as symptoms of depression, irritability, confusion, and convulsions. Cheilosis (cracks or sores on the lips), glossitis, and stomatitis can also be seen. Vitamin B6 is routinely administered to TB patients taking isoniazid; deficiency rarely occurs in well-nourished adults.  
Answer A is incorrect . Ethambutol can be used in combination therapy to treat TB, but it causes optic neuropathy (change in visual acuity or red-green color blindness). Ethambutol is not recommended in children, since visual acuity and changes in color perception are difficult to assess in them.  
Answer C is incorrect . Levofloxacin, a respiratory fluoroquinolone, is used as second-line combination therapy for the treatment of TB. Potential toxicities include tendinitis or tendon rupture in adults, and cartilage damage in children.  
Answer D is incorrect . Pyrazinamide can be used in combination therapy to treat TB, and it causes hepatotoxicity.  
Answer E is incorrect . Rifampin is a first-line therapy used in the treatment of TB, but it does not cause peripheral neuropathy. Adverse effects include GI (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea), CNS (headache and fever), dermatologic (rash, itching, and flushing), and hematologic (thrombocytopenia and acute hemolytic anemia). Patients should also be informed that rifampin causes red-orange discoloration of body fluids (eg, sweat, saliva, and tears).苏锦恭
