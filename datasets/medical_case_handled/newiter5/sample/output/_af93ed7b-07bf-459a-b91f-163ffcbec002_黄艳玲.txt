【1】CASE 48
-------

【2】A 50-year-old woman presents to your office with the complaints of fever, chills, nausea, and vomiting for the past 5 days. She is especially concerned because she just returned from a 3-week long church mission trip to central Africa during which she did not take the recommended malaria prophylaxis. She was careful about using insect repellent and wearing long-sleeved clothing, but she did not take the recommended weekly dose of mefloquine because it made her nauseous. Starting a few days after her return, she has had episodes of shaking chills followed by fever spikes as high as 103.5°F (39.7°C) and then profuse sweating. After these episodes she would feel so exhausted that she would sleep for hours. These severe episodes have been occurring every other day. In between these episodes, she has had low-grade fever, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. On examination, she appears very fatigued and pale. Her temperature is 99.9°F (37.7°C), pulse is 100 beats/minute, blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg, and respiratory rate is 18 breaths/minute. Other than signs of dehydration, her examination is unremarkable. A complete blood count shows her to be anemic. She has elevated blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and lactate dehydrogenase levels. A thin-blood smear is sent to the laboratory, which shows erythrocytes with ring forms at the periphery of the cell and multiple erythrocytes with 3 or 4 ring forms present.

【3】 What is the most likely etiology of her infection?

【4】 What findings on the thin blood smear are specific for this organism?

【5】### ANSWERS TO CASE 48:

【6】#### Malaria

【7】Summary: A 50-year-old woman has fever and body aches. A thin-blood smear shows erythrocytes with ring forms at the periphery of the cell and multiple erythrocytes with 3 or 4 ring forms.

【8】• Most likely etiology of her infection: Plasmodium falciparum .

【9】• Findings on the thin blood smear are specific for this organism: Multiple ring forms in a single erythrocyte and ring forms located at the periphery of the erythrocytes.

【10】### CLINICAL CORRELATION

【11】Malaria is caused by 1 of the 4 species of plasmodia involved in a human–mosquito–human life cycle. Plasmodia are coccidian parasites of erythrocytes. Their life cycle involves asexual reproduction in humans and sexual reproduction in the mosquito. Human infection is initiated by the bite of an infected mosquito, which introduces sporozoites into the bloodstream. The sporozoites travel to the liver, where they mature and reproduce asexually by schizogony. P. ovale and P. vivax may also establish a dormant—hypnozoite—stage in the liver; P. falciparum and P. malariae are incapable of this. On completion of the hepatic growth and reproductive stage, merozoites are released from hepatocytes and infect erythrocytes, initiating the erythrocytic cycle. Asexual reproduction continues, resulting in rupture of erythrocytes and release of more infectious merozoites. The classic symptoms of malaria relate to the paroxysm of shaking chills, fever, and sweating and correspond with the cyclical lysis of erythrocytes and release of merozoites. P. vivax, P. ovale , and P. falciparum species of malaria tend to produce paroxysms in 48-hour cycles (tertian malaria), whereas P. malariae causes paroxysms in 72-hour cycles (quartan malaria).

【12】A series of paroxysms of decreasing intensity constitutes a primary malarial attack. After the primary attack, parasites tend to disappear from the blood. In infections with P. falciparum or P. malariae , this would constitute a cure. In P. vivax and P. ovale infections, relapses may occur as a result of hypnozoites persisting in the liver.

【13】Complicating pathologic changes such as anemia, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly may occur. In the case of falciparum malaria, capillaries are blocked by infected erythrocytes that typically tend to become “sticky” and sequestered in capillary beds. Erythrocyte destruction leads to anemia. Capillary blockage leads to ischemia, anoxia, and subsequent organ damage. This is the basis for cerebral symptoms and kidney damage that leads to “blackwater fever,” a condition in which hemoglobin and erythrocytes appear in the urine; blackwater fever is associated with a poor prognosis. Falciparum malaria is the most virulent and lethal form of malaria, sometimes called malignant tertian malaria.

【14】### APPROACH TO:

【15】#### The Suspected Malaria Infection

【16】### OBJECTIVES

【17】1\. Learn the life cycle of Plasmodium species and the epidemiology and clinical course of infection.

【18】2\. Describe the 3 basic aspects of infection: transmission, diagnosis, and treatment/prevention.

【19】### DEFINITIONS

【20】RELAPSE MALARIA: Infection derived from hypnozoites ( hypnos \= sleeping; zo ites \= animals) or residual liver stages that persist after a primary infection with P. vivax and P. ovale

【21】APPLIQUÉ FORM: Parasite on the periphery of erythrocytes, as in P. falciparum infection

【22】RING STAGE: Stage in the life cycle of Plasmodium in an erythrocyte consisting of a thin ring of protoplasm with a nucleus at one side

【23】SCHIZOGONY: Asexual division or “splitting” carried out by all Plasmodium species

【24】BLACKWATER FEVER: A dangerous complication of malaria, especially falciparum, characterized by passage of red to black urine and associated with high mortality

【25】### DISCUSSION

【26】Characteristics of Plasmodium That Impact Transmission

【27】Plasmodium is a genus in the phylum Apicomplexa, which contains other human parasites such as Toxoplasma, Cryptosporidium, Cyclospora , and Isospora . All of these organisms belong to a phylogenetic class in which all species are parasitic.

【28】Malaria infections are endemic in tropical developing countries. Although endogenous malaria has occurred in the United States, most cases are imported by travelers. There are numerous species of Plasmodium , but only 4 species cause human malaria— P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae , and P. ovale . All species are transmitted by an infected Anopheles mosquito. Plasmodium sporozoites are the infective forms injected into the bloodstream when the mosquito takes a blood meal. The sporozoites circulate in the bloodstream and then invade hepatocytes to initiate a pre-erythrocytic cycle. In the liver parenchymal cells, the parasite multiplies asexually by a process called schizogony or splitting. Asexual reproduction gives rise to multiple individual stages or merozoites. These merozoites become blood-borne and invade erythrocytes to initiate the erythrocytic cycle. In the case of P. vivax and P. ovale , the liver phase can be sustained for years by sporozoite-derived dormant stages known as hypnozoites. It is the presence of the hypnozoites that leads to relapses of malarial symptoms, possibly occurring several years after the first acute episode has been cured.

【29】When merozoites parasitize erythrocytes, their development takes 2 routes. Merozoites develop into either micro (male) or macro (female) gametocytes. When a female Anopheles mosquito bites an infected person and ingests the gametocytes, fertilization of the macrogametocyte by the microgametocyte takes place in the mosquito with the subsequent and sequential formation of diploid zygotes, oocysts, and, eventually, sporozoites. Sporozoites travel to enter the salivary glands of the mosquito, where they are capable of initiating a new infection when the mosquito takes a blood meal. Through the second route in the erythrocytic cycle, the parasite develops successively through ring, trophozoite and schizont stages. As a result of schizogony, the erythrocyte breaks open and releases many new merozoites. These parasites then infect more erythrocytes and repeat the development cycle, ultimately causing the destruction of massive numbers of erythrocytes. The characteristic chill, fever, and sweating paroxysms occur when the parasites are released from the erythrocytes. Because the release of parasites becomes synchronized and periodic, the paroxysms are also periodic, occurring at 48 or 72 hours depending on the species. The destruction of erythrocytes and release of cell and parasite debris elicit host responses that contribute to pathologic changes.

【30】### DIAGNOSIS

【31】Diagnosis is made by finding the characteristic organisms on thick and thin blood smears. Differential diagnosis rests on knowing the specific morphologic characteristics of each species, which are revealed in a thin blood smear . P. vivax and P. ovale appear as ring shapes and in other advanced stages of development in enlarged erythrocytes that contain numerous granules, known as Schüffner dots. P. malariae has characteristic “band or bar” pattern and do not enlarge the host erythrocytes. P. falciparum can be identified by the presence of multiple ring forms within a single erythrocyte, in contrast to other plasmodia that will have only 1 ring form per erythrocyte. P. falciparum ring forms also tend to occur at the periphery of the erythrocyte; these “appliqué” forms are distinctive for this species. Mixed infections with more than 1 species of Plasmodium may occur.

【32】### TREATMENT AND PREVENTION

【33】From the perspective of patient management, drugs to treat malaria fall into three categories: prophylactic, schizonticidal, and antirelapse. Prophylactics are designed to prevent infection by attacking the sporozoite stages or preventing the development of clinical symptoms by preventing schizogony in the erythrocytic cycle. Schizonticidal compounds may be used in prophylactic measures and to affect a clinical cure in an acute infection. Antirelapse drugs are directed against hypnozoite stages, as in P. vivax infection. A radical cure in P. vivax and P. ovale infections requires the use of drugs that eradicate both the erythrocytic and exoerythrocytic schizonts in the liver.

【34】Chloroquine is a schizonticidal compound and with the exception of the treatment of P. falciparum derived malaria (which has developed widespread resistance to chloroquine), it is the drug of choice in treating all other clinical cases of malaria. Mefloquine, referred to in the case presentation, is used in prophylaxis and also to treat chloroquine resistant strains of Plasmodium . Drug resistance of certain strains of Plasmodium is a practical problem. For P. falciparum infections, intravenous artemisinin-derivatives such as artesunate are first-line options if available; however, if they are unavailable, then second-line drugs are quinine, chemically related mefloquine, or combination sulfadoxine (a sulfonamide)/ pyrimethamine (pyrimidine derivative). Antirelapse or tissue schizonticidal drugs are aimed at hypnozoites (liver schizonts). The drug of choice in this category is primaquine.
