【0】1.1 A 48-year-old man is noted to have a 2-day history of sore throat， subjective fever at home， and no medical illnesses. He denies cough or nausea. On exami-nation， his temperature is 38.3℃(101°F)， and he has some tonsillar swelling but no exudate. He has bilateral enlarged and tender lymph nodes of the neck. The rapid streptococcal antigen test is negative. Which of the following is the best next step!

【1】A. Oral clindamycin

【2】B. Treatment based on results from throat culture

【3】C.CObservation

【4】D.Begin amantadine

【5】1.2 Which of the following patients is most likely to have group A streptococcal infection?

【6】A. An 11-month-old male infant with fever and red throat

【7】B.An 8-year-old girl with fever and sore throat

【8】C. A 27-year-old man with a temperature of 38.9℃(102°F)， pharyngitis， and cough

【9】D. A 52-year-old woman who complains of fever of 39.2°℃(102.5°F) and sore throat

【10】1.3 A 19-year-old college student has had a sore throat， mild abdominal pain，and fever for 5 days. He was playing football with some friends， and was tackled just short of the goal line， hitting the grass somewhat forcibly. He experiences some abdominal pain， and passes out. The EMS (emergency medical services) is called and his vital signs reveal the heart rate as 140 beats per minute and blood pressure as 80/40 mm Hg with a distended abdomen. Which of the following is the most likely etiology?

【11】AVasovagal reactionBRuptured aortic aneurysm

【12】C. Complications of Epstein-Barr infection

【13】删除38：<u>)</u>. Ruptured jejunum
1.4 An 18-year-old woman presents with fever and a sore throat. She is sitting up drooling， with some stridor. Her temperature is 39.4°℃(103°F) and she appears ill. Which of the following is your next step?

【14】A. Examine the pharynx and obtain a rapid antigen test.

【15】B.Empiric treatment with penicillin.

【16】C. Throat culture and treatment based on results.

【17】D. Send the patient to radiology for an anteroposterior (AP) neck radiograph.

【18】E. Prepare for emergent airway management.

【19】ANSWERS

【20】1.1 B. This individual has a modifed Centor score of 2 (history of fever， tender adenopathy， no cough， age >45 y). The rapid antigen test is negative， but a definitive culture should be performed for a Centor score of 2 or 3， and treat-ment should be based on culture results.

【21】1.2 B. GABS is most common in patients younger than 15 years (although not in infants). McIsaac added age as a criteria because patients older than age 45 years have a much lower incidence of streptococcal pharyngitis.

【22】1.3 C. This patient most likely suffered from splenic rupture caused by mononucle-osis (EBV). He is hypotensive because of the massive hemoperitoneum. Aortic aneurysm is rare in teenagers.

【23】1.4 E. Regardless of the etiology， this patient has a clinical presentation alarming for impending respiratory collapse， and preparations for emergent airway man-agement is the most important next step. The drooling and stridor are suspi-cious for epiglottitis， which can present more insidiously in adults. Examination of the posterior oropharynx may induce laryngospasm and airway obstruction， particularly in children； a lateral neck radiograph to assess for a“thumbprint-ing”of epiglottitis may be helpful in making the diagnosis， but sending the patient with impending respiratory failure to radiology area is inappropriate.

【24】CLINICAL PEARLS

【25】The most common cause of pharyngitis is viral.

【26】The Centor criteria suggestive of GABS pharyngitis include tonsillar exu-date， tender anterior cervical adenopathy， history of fever， and absence of cough.

【27】GABS pharyngitis is more common in patients younger than 15 years of age， and less common in those older than 45 years of age.

【28】Overtreatment of pharyngitis with antibiotics is common and is a major source ot antibiotic overuse.

【29】Glomerulonephritis is a rare complication of GABS pharyngitis (but not GABS infections of other tissues) that is not clearly prevented by antibi-otic therapy.

【30】Rheumatic fever is an exceedingly rare complication of GABS pharyngitis that can be prevented by antibiotic therapy.

【31】Complicated upper airway conditions shouldbe considered when a patient presents with“sore throat.”

【32】In general， cricothyroidotomy is the safest method of surgically securing an airway in the ED.黄艳玲
