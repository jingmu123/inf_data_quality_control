【0】CASE 38: PASSED OUT DURING BOXING

【1】History

【2】A 17-year-old male student is brought to the Emergency Department after being punched  删除换行1 from the side in a boxing match. He passed out but quickly regained consciousness. He complains of a throbbing headache and nausea, and has also vomited twice.

【3】Examination

【4】Screening cervical spine, central and peripheral nerve exams are normal. Abbreviated mental test score is 9/10.

【5】Questions

【6】1. Would you order a CT scan of the head? Justify your answer.

【7】2. What other aspects of his history are important to explore?

【8】3. What advice would you give the patient and his parents?

【9】DISCUSSION

【10】The basic principles of Advanced Trauma Life Support should be applied when dealing with  删除换行1 this patient. Major injuries to rule out include cervical spine fractures or ligamentous injuries,  删除换行1 intracranial bleeding and blunt cerebrovascular injuries. Imaging studies are not necessary  删除换行1 in all cases, but should be considered if the clinical suspicion is high. The NICE guidelines on  删除换行1 head injury state that a CT scan is indicated if any of the following are present:

【11】• GCS < 13 on initial assessment

【12】• GCS < 15 at 2 hours after injury on assessment in the Emergency Department

【13】• Suspected open or depressed skull fracture

【14】• Any sign of basal skull fracture

【15】• Post-traumatic seizure

【16】• Focal neurological deficit

【17】• More than one episode of vomiting since the head injury

【18】• Dangerous mechanism of injury

【19】• Anti-coagulant use (e.g. warfarin, NOACs)

【20】• >30 minutes of retrograde amnesia

【21】In this case, as the patient has vomited twice post head injury, a non-contrast CT scan of  删除换行1 the head would be indicated to rule out skull fracture and/or subdural haematoma with the  删除换行1 lateral head injury. The CT scan in this case is normal.

【22】Concussion is typically managed in the outpatient setting. While the most important aspects  删除换行1 of the ED encounter include ruling out life- and limb-threatening injuries, establishing a  删除换行1 diagnosis of concussion can have profound impact on the long-term outcomes of the individual. A suspicion of concussion should prompt a referral to a concussion expert. Depending  删除换行1 on local practice, this could be a General Practitioner with an interest in sports medicine, a  删除换行1 neurologist or a neurosurgeon. In larger centres, these specialists often work together in the  删除换行1 evaluation and management of the patient.

【23】The patient should be advised to avoid contact or collision sports until further evaluation and  删除换行1 clearance by a concussion specialist. Young athletes in particular should not be allowed to  删除换行1 return to play due to the risk of Second Impact Syndrome. In the acute period after a concussion, the patient is particularly vulnerable to further injury as a result of impaired reaction  删除换行1 and decision-making abilities.

【24】One of the key elements to establish is the concussion history of the patient. A history of multiple concussions, each with progressively longer recovery times, should prompt warning to  删除换行1 the patient that further injury could lead to substantially greater morbidity and mortality. The  删除换行1 effects of performance-enhancing drugs and illicit substance use in a concussed individual  删除换行1 are controversial but should be taken into account, and screening should be considered. The  删除换行1 use of helmets, while protective to a certain extent, does little to prevent rotational injuries.

【25】No treatment has been proven to speed recovery from a concussion. Some advocate for strict  删除换行1 rest (no physical activities, no reading, no television/computers/phones) for 5–7 days, but  删除换行1 compliance will be an issue. Others have suggested an early active rehabilitation approach  删除换行1 including strict rest in the first day or two, followed by the gradual introduction of mental  删除换行1 activities and subsequently progressively intense physical activities.

【26】In this case, with a negative CT scan, the patient should be discharged, provided there is  删除换行1 someone on hand to supervise him at home, with both written and verbal instructions of the 139

【27】Case 38: Passed out during boxing 删除换行1 normal symptoms of concussion and red flags such as increased drowsiness, seizures, focal  删除换行1 neurology and ongoing vomiting. Should the patient deteriorate at home or if the carer is  删除换行1 concerned, they should return to the ED for reassessment. On occasion, patients may have  删除换行1 delayed bleeds, which may necessitate re-scanning.

【28】Key Points

【29】• Rule out life- and limb-threatening injuries when dealing with a suspected concussion injury.

【30】• Establish a diagnosis of concussion based on high clinical suspicion.

【31】• Refer the patient to a concussion specialist for further outpatient evaluation and  删除换行1 management.

【32】• Always discharge patients with head injury into the care of a relative with both  删除换行1 verbal and written head injury instructions detailing normal concussive symptoms  删除换行1 and when to return to the ED.删除9：<u>http://taylorandfrancis.com141</u>黄艳玲
