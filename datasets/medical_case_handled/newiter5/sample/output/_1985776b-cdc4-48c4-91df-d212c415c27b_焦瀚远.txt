Abstract

【10】Mr. Northwood is a 25 year-old Caucasian man, who presented with a chief complaint of being infested by “bugs.” He reported intense, bothersome sensations of crawling, stinging, and biting, which were felt frequently all over this body. He otherwise had a clean bill of health and denied any psychological stress or emotional issues. Upon further questioning, he admitted to regular, heavy use of cocaine for the past 2 years. After he had started experimenting with cocaine, he started to notice these symptoms, which were tolerable at the time. However, the sensations progressively worsened to the point where he could no longer resist the urge to scratch or to pick at his skin. His general practitioner could not determine the cause, and as a result, referred him to your psychodermatology clinic for help.

【11】Mr. Northwood is a 25 year-old Caucasian man, who presented with a chief complaint of being infested by “bugs.” He reported intense, bothersome sensations of crawling, stinging, and biting, which were felt frequently all over this body. He otherwise had a clean bill of health and denied any psychological stress or emotional issues. Upon further questioning, he admitted to regular, heavy use of cocaine for the past 2 years. After he had started experimenting with cocaine, he started to notice these symptoms, which were tolerable at the time. However, the sensations progressively worsened to the point where he could no longer resist the urge to scratch or to pick at his skin. His general practitioner could not determine the cause, and as a result, referred him to your psychodermatology clinic for help.

【12】You gently suggested that the temporal association between his period of cocaine use and the appearance of his symptoms might explain the etiology of his condition. However, Mr. Northwood insisted that there were “bugs” involved, and brought up the fact that a few of his fellow cocaine users were noting similar symptoms suggestive of infestation. After a long discussion, you convinced him that a referral to a drug rehabilitation program was needed. As for the formication symptoms, you discussed possibly taking pimozide at the next visit, after he had had a normal electrocardiogram (EKG) test. A few weeks later, you were notified that Mr. Northwood never showed up to his initial visit at the rehab facility. Thereafter, all attempts to reach the patient were not successful.

【13】Reflections on the Case
-----------------------

【14】Formication has been associated with the use of certain recreational drugs, such as cocaine, amphetamine, and narcotics. Patients who are dependent on alcohol tend to experience visual DoP not during periods of alcohol use but during periods of alcohol withdrawal. Of note, a number of medical conditions can also cause the DoP-type clinical picture, including but not limited to B12 or folate deficiency, thyroid abnormality, etc.

【15】“Cocaine bug” is a commonly used term among cocaine users who frequently experience formication from cocaine use. Fortunately, most of these cocaine users know that the formication is from cocaine and not from a real-life situation. In rare instances that are typically seen with chronic drug abuse, a small portion of cocaine users may develop full-blown delusional parasitosis and come to believe that they are truly infested 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 23 \]</u>. This has been reported in a couple experiencing a shared delusion associated with cocaine use 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 24 \]</u>. The case described above was chosen deliberately for Mr. Northwood’s imperfect insight because those with clear insight regarding the drug-induced nature of their symptoms are unlikely to seek help from a dermatologic practitioner.

【16】It is important to be mindful about Mr. Northwood’s sensitivity surrounding his history of multi-recreational drug use. If you phrase your questions as blunt and forceful requests, he may become defensive and deny any drug use altogether. It may be wise to ask questions about his recreational drug use very nonchalantly – as if this is simply an effort on your part to obtain information about every patient’s medical history in a thorough fashion. He may find it comfortably acceptable if questions about his recreational drug use are conducted in a mechanical fashion, following routine questions about his general health (i.e. sleep, appetite, etc.) as well as any history of over-the-counter and prescription drug use.

【17】In terms of management, the first and the foremost intervention is to get these patients to discontinue the current drug abuse. Without detoxification, there is no reliable solution to their condition. Moreover, chronic drug users commonly abuse multiple recreational substances, as illustrated by the case of Mr. Northwood, who admitted to using narcotics in addition to cocaine. This renders the use of pimozide risky even for symptomatic relief, since pimozide is known to have opiate blocking effects and can precipitate withdrawal reactions depending on the degree to which the patient is addicted to the narcotics.

【18】It is an unfortunate fact that drug abusers, similar to alcoholics, are typically resistant to accepting help. Nevertheless, referrals to detoxification programs should still be made with much enthusiasm and encouragement on your part. Even though these patients may not follow up with your referrals within a reasonable time frame, with enough accumulated difficulty in life, they will eventually commit to receiving professional help. A useful analogy that the author (JK) frequently employs is that of a stonecutter, who may strike a large stone many times at first with no visible effects. After numerous strikes, the stone suddenly splits open. This is to say that the practitioner should not feel discouraged about the initial resistance from the recalcitrant drug-abusing patient.焦瀚远
