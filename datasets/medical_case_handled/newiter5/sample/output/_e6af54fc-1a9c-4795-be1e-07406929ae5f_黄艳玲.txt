【0】CASE 28

【1】An emergency medical team is called to help a 60-year-old woman with small cell lung cancer who is unconscious at work. Her coworkers state that for about10 seconds before she lost consciousness，she pointed to her right hand as it began twitching rhythmically， then stiffened every muscle and fell down. After about 15 seconds，she became incontinent and her arms and legs began jerking rhythmically. She then was still， unresponsive， and unconscious for about 3 minutes. The medical team notes she is now breathing deeply but remains unresponsive.

【2】What is the most likely diagnosis?

【3】Seizure. Involvement of the left motor cortex is implicated because the seizure started with right-handed motor activity. In this patient a metastasis is the likely culprit. Seizures can also be caused by infection， ischemia， drug exposure or withdrawal， certain ion imbalances including hypoglycemia and hyponatremia， and trauma.

【4】How is this condition classified?

【5】This is a simple partial seizure with motor signs secondarily generalizing into a tonic-clonic seizure. During the first 10 seconds， the patient maintained consciousness， pointing to a simple seizure (complex seizures require a loss of consciousness). After the first 10 seconds， her simple partial seizure evolved into a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. The tonic phase is characterized by the immobile contraction of all muscles， and the clonic phase is characterized by the bilateral rhythmic jerking of the extremities.

【6】Why is the patient breathing deeply after her incident?

【7】The patient is likely responding to acidosis. A respiratory acidosis can develop from the loss of coordinated respirations during the seizure， and a metabolic acidosis can develop as muscles contract under anaerobic conditions and produce lactic acid.

【8】What is the appropriate treatment for this condition?

【9】Popular antiseizure medications include valproic acid， phenytoin， phenobarbital， primidone， and carbamazepine. Many antiseizure medications work by enhancing y-aminobutyric acid (GABA) binding on chloride channels. GABA binding allows chloride ions to flow into neurons， thereby inhibiting neuronal firing. Barbiturates act on the same chloride channels and enhance GABA signaling by increasing the duration of chloride channel opening. Benzodiazepines act on the same channels and enhance GABA signaling， but they do so by increasing the frequency of chloride channel opening.

【10】What are the most common adverse effects of treatment?

【11】Adverse effects of seizure treatments are as follows：

【12】·Valproate： Hepatotoxicity， neutropenia， thrombocytopenia， teratogenicity (neural tube defects in the fetus).

【13】·Carbamazepine： Hepatotoxicity (check liver function)， aplastic anemia， agranulocytosis.

【14】●Phenytoin： Gingival hyperplasia， teratogenicity.

【15】Ethosuximide and lamotrigine： Stevens-Johnson syndrome (a bullous form of erythema multiforme that involves mucous membranes and large areas of the body).

【16】· Carbamazepine and phenobarbital： Induction of cytochrome P450， resulting in drug interactions.黄艳玲
