【0】Question: 3.1 Which of the following is illegal in all US jurisdictions?

【1】A. PAS

【2】B. Palliative sedation

【3】C. Escalating doses of narcotics for analgesia when respiratory depression and death result

【4】D. Euthanasia

【5】E. Withdrawal of life support in a patient with a nonterminal illness

【6】Answer: 3.1 D. Euthanasia, also called active mercy killing, is illegal in every US jurisdiction. It is permissible in The Netherlands. Euthanasia is distinguished from PAS as follows. In euthanasia, the physician directly causes the patient’s death; in cases of PAS, the physician provides a prescription to the patient to obtain a lethal dose of medication that the patient self-administers. Competent patients have the right to refuse all care, including life-sustaining care, even if such refusal will cause certain death and even if the illness is reversible. Finally, the principle of secondary effect refers to the permissible use of medications, such as morphine, in sufficient doses to treat suffering, even if those doses may secondarily hasten death.

【7】Question: 3.2 Ethical principles about decisions on end-of-life care include all of the following except :

【8】A. Primum non nocere

【9】B. Autonomy

【10】C. Futility

【11】D. Nonmaleficence

【12】E. Due process

【13】Answer: 3.2 E. All of the answers refer to ethical considerations with the exception of due process, which is a concept in constitutional law.

【14】Question: 3.3 At the time of publication, in which of the following jurisdictions is PAS prohibited?

【15】A. Massachusetts

【16】B. Montana

【17】C. Oregon

【18】D. Vermont

【19】E. Washington
Answer: 3.3 A. At the time of publication, Oregon, Washington, and Vermont all have legalized PAS by statute. Montana has case law allowing the practice. These are the only 4 states authorizing the practice in any way as of the time of publication. New Mexico has a case law that allows the practice, though it is currently being appealed.

【20】KEY POINTS

【21】 Patients have broadly recognized autonomy to refuse life sustaining or prolonging interventions, but access to legally permissible PAS is limited in the most US jurisdictions.

【22】 The AMA opposes the practice of PAS.

【23】 PAS is an issue that highlights the potential for conflict between ethics as articulated by organized medicine and legally permissible conduct.

【24】 Physicians are never obligated to participate in PAS, even in jurisdictions in which the practice is legally permissible.

【25】 Euthanasia, or active mercy killing, is illegal in all US jurisdictions. However, euthanasia must be distinguished from other interventions that are permissible and may secondarily cause death such as palliation and withdrawal of life-prolonging/sustaining care in cases of futility or competent patient choice.王磊
