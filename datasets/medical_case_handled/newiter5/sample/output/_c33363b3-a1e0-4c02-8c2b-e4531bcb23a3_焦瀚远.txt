Abstract
--------

【8】The Patient was a 75-year-old male who presented with constant chest pain. He had a history of established coronary artery disease. He underwent PCI 2 months prior to this admission. Repeated coronary angiogram showed patent stent and no new stenosis.

【9】As patient had negative cardiac work up, and because of ongoing chest pain, he underwent chest CT scan. It showed a lytic lesion at the T5 with erosion of the posterior cortex but no evidence of any soft tissue extension as well as concern for extensive thoracic osseous metastatic disease. Patient was then referred to oncology service for further assessment.

【12】Clinical Case

【13】The patient was a 75-year-old man who presented to the hospital with exertional chest pain over the last 3 days relieved by nitroglycerin spray. He denies shortness of breath, orthopnea, PND, palpitations, or syncope.

【14】On exam, he looks frail. Blood pressure 177/73 mmHg, pulse rate regular at 74 beats/min, temperature 37.5 °C, oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. Chest is clear. No adventitious sounds. Heart has normal S1, S2 with no murmur and both lower extremities are symmetric in size with no edema.

【15】His risk factors include current smoking and hyperlipidemia.

【16】He underwent PCI on LAD two months prior to this admission.

【17】His ECG has not changed since prior ECGs. He had negative troponin two times and his pain responded to nitroglycerine. Consequently, his coronary angiogram showed patent stents and no new stenosis.

【18】As patient had negative cardiac work up because of an ongoing chest pain , he underwent a chest CT scan. It showed a lytic lesion at the T5 level with erosion of the posterior cortex but no evidence of any soft tissue extension as well as concern for extensive thoracic osseous metastatic disease 删除33：<u></u>. Patient referred to oncology service for further assessment. He was diagnosed with metastatic osseous disease of unknown primary and received radiotherapy.

【22】Clinical Pearls

【23】   Chest pain in a patient with established CAD always raises suspicion for cardiac causes, but non cardiac pain especially when related to life-threatening causes like as dissection of aorta, pulmonary embolism or even GI bleeding associated with hemoglobin drop always should be considered in the work up of chest pain.
   Significant anemia could cause chest pain and shortness of breath on exertion. This patient with no known cancer history was found to have a lytic lesion in the spine causing him chest pain.
   There are also case reports of empyema, rib osteomyelitis, slipping rib syndrome presented as chest pain which is not responding to routine analgesics 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 1 – 3 \]</u>.焦瀚远
