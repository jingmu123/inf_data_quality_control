【0】Question: A 29-year-old man complains to his physician of chronic diarrhea. On further questioning he reveals that the diarrhea is watery and intermittent, and that he also suffers from flatulence and weight loss of 3.6 kg (8 lb) over the past year. He denies fever, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and recent travel. Stool examinations for ova and parasites and for occult blood are negative, and stool culture does not grow any pathogens. Endoscopy is performed and biopsy of the upper part of the small intestine demonstrates diffuse blunting of villi and a chronic inflammatory infiltrate in the lamina propria. Which therapeutic option will most likely benefit this patient?

【1】> (A) Gluten-free diet

【2】> (B) Corticosteroid therapy

【3】> (C) Antibiotic therapy

【4】> (D) Thiamine and vitamin B12</sub>

【5】> (E) Vitamins A, D, E, and K

【6】 Answer: The correct answer is A . The patient’s clinical, laboratory, and histologic features are indicative of celiac sprue. The classical presentation of this disease is during infancy, but it may also present any time between the ages of 10 and 40. Classic signs include diarrhea, foulsmelling, bulky, floating stools, weight loss, growth failure, and vitamin deficiencies. These symptoms follow exposure to the protein gliadin, which results in intestinal inflammation. A gluten-free diet usually relieves symptoms and restores mucosal histology, and therefore it is the most appropriate therapeutic measure.  
Answer B is incorrect . Corticosteroids may be employed in the treatment of refractory sprue, but a gluten-free diet is the most appropriate step at this time.  
Answer C is incorrect . Antibiotic therapy does not have a place in the treatment of celiac sprue.  
Answer D is incorrect . While patients with celiac sprue are often deficient in B vitamins, treating the underlying pathology is the best course.  
Answer E is incorrect . While patients with celiac sprue are often deficient in fat-soluble vitamins, treating the underlying pathology is the best course.苏锦恭
