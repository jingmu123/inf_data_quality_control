【0】CASE 100: WEIGHT LOSS

【1】History

【2】The general practitioner is consulted by a 15-year-old girl who presents with her mother. Her  删除换行1 mother has made her come along because she has noticed a marked weight loss in her daughter over the past few weeks. She has also noticed that her daughter seems pale and unwell.
Normally, when she presents to the surgery the young woman wears baggy clothes and is not  删除换行1 forthcoming, and there have been times when the GP has suspected an eating disorder. The  删除换行1 patient’s body mass index (BMI) hovers around 19, but an eating disorder has always been  删除换行1 denied by the patient and her mother. The GP has never noticed the patient being as thin as  删除换行1 she is now. The patient has a younger brother 12 years of age and they live with their parents  删除换行1 on the local estate. The girl has not had any serious illness but the GP has seen her on a number of occasions with minor disorders such as sore throats and coughs and colds. It appears  删除换行1 that she and her mother do not get along very well, but it has never been possible to work out  删除换行1 what is really going on. It has been frustrating and worrying for the GP who has taken the  删除换行1 situation to the surgery clinical meetings on a number of occasions but the practice has not  删除换行1 been able to get to the bottom of the problem.

【3】The GP assumes that the girl is suffering from a worsening of the suspected eating disorder  删除换行1 and hopes that this time they will finally be able to tackle the problem. However, on questioning the girl further, the GP is surprised when the girl tells her that she has been feeling  删除换行1 really thirsty recently and passing lots of urine, even getting up at night a few times to go to  删除换行1 the toilet.

【5】• What is the probable diagnosis?

【6】• What does the GP do now?

【8】ANSWER 100

【9】With the classic signs of polydypsia, polyuria and weight loss the girl probably has type 1  删除换行1 diabetes mellitus.

【10】The GP finds glucose and ketones in the urine and a finger-prick blood glucose reports ‘HI’.The girl’s BMI is now down to 17. With signs of ketoacidosis, the GP refers her straight to hospital where it is found that she has borderline acidosis and ketosis, a blood sugar of 34 mmol/L  删除换行5 and an HbA1C (glycated haemoglobin) of 15.8% (149.2 mmol/mol). The patient is admitted  删除换行1 from casualty for treatment and she started on insulin. She talks with the diabetic nurse  删除换行1 specialist and the dietitian about her condition and its management. After 14 days, her blood  删除换行1 glucose control has improved dramatically. Diabetic retinal screening and foot examination  删除换行1 are normal. The diabetic clinic plans to refer her to the 5-day Dose Adjustment For Normal  删除换行5 Eating (DAFNE) programme at 6 months, after the initial period of attempting best control.

【11】The GP must still keep in mind, the possibility of an eating disorder as well as the diabetes.
An eating disorder and type 1 diabetes in a teenage girl is a dangerous mix. It has been estimated that one in three young women with diabetes abuse their insulin, missing injections  删除换行1 to stay thin, leading to a greatly increased risk of diabetic complications. This young patient  删除换行1 needs rapid access to psychological care and support, with close monitoring to help her manage her condition effectively. The GP hopes that the diabetes has at least given a way in to  删除换行1 treating other family and psychological problems.

【12】• Keep your mind open to possibilities when eliciting a history.

【13】• Signs of ketoacidosis in a patient with suspected diabetes mellitus require urgent  删除换行1 referral to hospital.

【14】• ‘Diabulimia’ as it has been termed – missing injections to stay thin – is a common  删除换行1 and dangerous condition in women with diabetes.
