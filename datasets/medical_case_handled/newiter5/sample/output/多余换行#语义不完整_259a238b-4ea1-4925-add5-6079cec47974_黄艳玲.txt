【0】Case 16
A 34-year-old man presents to the emergency department (ED) complaining of shortness of breath and chest pain that he describes as right sided and increased with deep breathing. He states it started suddenly when he woke up and was worse with activity. He denies fever， chills， nausea， vomiting， or cough. He has a recent history of multiple gunshot wounds resulting in ongoing pain in his upper back and T-10 paraplegia. One week ago， he was discharged from the hospital to a rehabilitation facility. He is currently taking acetaminophen/hydrocodone and ibuprofen for his pain， which has increased with his physical therapy and occupa-tional therapy. He is also taking hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril for hyperten-sion and fluoxetine for depression. He recently quit smoking tobacco since he was hospitalized and denies any alcohol or illicit drug use. On physical examination， he is an otherwise fit young man who appears slightly short of breath and uncom-fortable. His heart rate is 101 beats per minute， his blood pressure is 110/78 mm Hg， and his respiratory rate is 26 breaths per minute. His pulse oximetry is 96%on2 L of O， by nasal canula. His lungs are clear to auscultation. There is mild swell-ing of his left calf. He has no sensation in his lower extremities. Laboratory studies reveal a white blood cell count (WBC) of 10，000/mm. Hemoglobin， hematocrit， electrolytes， and renal function are all within normal limits. A 12-lead electrocar-diogram (ECG) reveals a sinus rhythm at a rate of 103 beats per minute. His chest radiograph reveals minimal bibasilar atelectasis but no evidence of infiltrates or effusions.

【4】3\. Learn the sensitivity， specificity， and limitations of the D-dimer test and the contrast-enhanced helical computed tomography angiogram for the diagnosis of DVT and PE.This 34-year-old patient who has been immobilized has a primary risk factor for venous thromboembolism. The presentation of acute dyspnea， chest pain， border-line tachycardia， and unilateral lower extremity swelling in the absence of identifi-able alternative cardiopulmonary disease place him in the high-risk category for a pulmonary embolism. An ECG in patients with suspected PE is generally helpful for identifying other etiologies of his symptoms such as ischemic heart disease， pericar-ditis， and dysrhythmias. In some instances， the ECG may reveal right-heart strain patterns that are more specific for the diagnosis of PE. Although nonspecific， sinus tachycardia is still the most frequent presenting ECG finding among patients with PE. Even 25% of patients with identified PE may have a normal ECG. The rela-tively normal chest radiograph is valuable in eliminating alternative diagnoses， such as pneumonia， pneumothorax， and congestive heart failure. An arterial blood gas can be used to assess patients with shortness of breath， but it is non-specific in the diagnosis of PE. Taking into consideration the clinical， radiographic， and ECG data， a presumptive diagnosis of PE can be made. The next steps in management include maintenance of cardiopulmonary stability， consideration of empiric anticoagulation therapy， and confirmation of the diagnosis.D-DIMER ASSAY： Fibrin D-dimer is released into the circulation following degra-dation of cross-linked fibrin by plasmin. Multiple commercial assays are available that use a monoclonal antibody to detect the D-dimer fragment. The two most com-monly used assays are the whole blood immunoagglutination test (less accurate) and the quantitative plasma ELISA assay (more accurate). Elevated levels may indicate the presence of concurrent thrombus formation and degradation. Other conditions in which D-dimer elevation occurs include sepsis， recent myocardial infarction or stroke (<10 days)， recent surgery or trauma， disseminated intravascular coagulation， collagen vascular disease， metastatic cancer， pregnancy， hospitalized patients and liver disease. The D-dimer may be falsely negative if clot formation is greater than72 hours before the blood is assayed. Conversely， it may be falsely positive since levels may remain elevated for as long as 2 years. In pregnancy， the upper limits of normal are increased with each trimester， but a true normal D-dimer should never be greater than 1000 ug/L.COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY PULMONARY ANGIOGRAPHY (CTPA)：Magnified CT imaging of the pulmonary vasculature obtained during the arterial phases of venous contrast injection. While highly specific for PE， the reported sen-sitivity is variable and ranges from 50% to 90%. The diagnostic sensitivity is higher for centrally located PE but reduced for subsegmental clots. The Prospective Investi-gation of Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis II (PIOPED II) study suggests that CTPA identifies more PE than V/Q scanning， but these may be false-positives or clots that do not require anticoagulation. The diagnostic accuracy is also related to observer expertise. The initiation of multidetector CT scanning has greatly improved imag-ing of central， segmental， and subsegmental arteries. An advantage of this modality is its ability to detect alternative diagnoses. Pulmonary MDCT angiography has a reported sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 96% in PIOPED II.Up to 60% of patients with untreated proximal DVT will develop PE； conse-quently， accurate diagnosis of this condition is critical for emergency physicians. Unfortunately， the clinical features of DVT are frequently nonspecific， and may include pain， tenderness， swelling， edema， and erythema. The physical examination and thromboembolic risk factors  are important in assessing the clinical suspicion (ie， pretest probability)， and based on the pretest probability， clinical algo-rithm for the diagnosis of lower extremity DVT may be formulated 删除33：<u></u>.

Duplex ultrasound is the most common test used to evaluate for the presence of DVT. Its accuracy approaches 98% for proximal DVT detection， when an experienced operator performs the test. ELISA D-dimer can serve as a screening tool for DVT. In practice， a positive ELISA D-dimer is not of any clinical value. However， due to its high sensitivity， a negative ELISA D-dimer suggests the absence of an acute thrombus. In patients with low pretest probability and a negative ELISA D-dimer， the diagnosis of DVT can be ruled out. Venography is the traditional gold standard for DVT. However， due to its invasiveness， risk of reaction to contrast dye， and the advent of newer tech-nologies that are just as accurate， venography is rarely used in clinical practice

【7】of thrombus propagation and embolization. In patients with extensive DVT that involves the iliac and femoral veins， the use of thrombolytic therapy should be considered to help minimize the postphlebitic sequelae. For most patients， acute management consists of anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH). When UFH therapy is selected， it is vital to achieve therapeutic levels rapidly. When this is accomplished within 24 hours， the DVT recurrence rate is 4% to 6%， compared to 23% when therapeutic levels are delayed. LMWH can be administered for the treatment of DVT with or without PE. Enoxaparin is a commonly used LMWH . Patients developing recurrent DVT during optimal anticoagulation therapy should undergo evaluation for hypercoagulability conditions and be considered for inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement (eg， Greenfield filter). IVC filters are also useful for individuals with contraindications to anticoagulation. However， these filters present their own risks for developing thrombosis and PE and have limited effect over time.Few common medical conditions are as difficult to diagnose as PE. The majority of patients have dyspnea and chest pain at presentation， whereas cardiovascular col-lapse is observed in 10% of the patients. Symptoms of PE include sudden onset cough(3%-55%)， blood-streaked sputum (3%-40%)， sudden onset of dyspnea at rest or with exertion (75%)， splinting of ribs with breathing， chest pain (50%-85%)， and diaphoresis (25%-40%). Nonspecific signs of PE include tachypnea (50%-60%)， tachycardia (25%-70%)， rales/crackles (50%)， and low-grade fever (7%-50%)， the latter of which is suggestive of pulmonary infarction. Tachypnea is the most com-monly reported sign in patients diagnosed with PE. Chest pain associated with PE is commonly pleurtitic in nature. The “classic triad" for PE (hemoptysis， dyspnea，

PE is occasionally diagnosed in young， active patients presenting to the ED complaining only of pleuritic chest pain. Such patients are often dismissed inappropriately with inadequate workups and nonspecific diagnoses such as musculoskeletal chest pain or pleurisy. Spontaneous onset of chest wall tenderness without a history of trauma is worrisome， because this may be the only physical finding of PE. In a recent study by Courtney et al， non-cancer-related throbophilia， pleuritic chest pain and family his-tory of VTE increased the probablility of PE or DVT. Unusual clinical presentations of PE also include seizure， syncope， abdominal pain， high fever， productive cough， adult-onset asthma， new-onset supraventricular arrhythmias， or hiccups.The diagnosis of PE remains a difficult task despite the multitude of resources. Rou-tine tests obtained in the ED， such as radiographs， ABGs， and ECG provide limited and nonspecific information. In an effort to make the correct diagnosis， EPs must calculate a pretest probability for PE. There are multiple scoring systems available that attempt to classify patients into low， intermediate， and high-risk categories. A commonly used scoring system is the Wells criteria . Based on findings from the PIOPED study， clinicians correctly excluded pulmonary embolism 91%of the time in low-clinical-probability patients； however， in the intermediate- and high-probability patients， clinicians correctly diagnosed PE only 64% to 68% of the time. Because clinical variables alone lack power to permit treatment decisions， patients with intermediate to high probability must undergo further testing until the diagnosis is proven， ruled out， or an alternative diagnosis is identified.
The Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria (PERC) is another commonly used clinical decision rule . This rule only applies to those who are low risk for PE. If eight of the clinical criteria are met， then there is less than a 2% risk that the patient has a PE and no further work-up is needed.

【10】The initial chest radiograph (CXR) in a patient with PE is abnormal in 76%to 90% of patients. However， there is no finding on chest radiograph that is diagnostic of PE. Rarely， the classic Westermark sign (peripheral lung vasoconstric-tion) and Hampton hump (pleural wedge-shaped density associated with pulmonary infarction) are seen. Serial CXRs obtained in a patient with PE are frequently associ-ated with progression suggestive of atelectasis， pleural effusion， and elevated hemi-diaphragm. After 2 to 3 days， the CXR in one-third of patients with PE demonstrates focal infiltrates mimicking pneumonia. Because of the variability in these findings， chest radiography is of limited use in diagnosing PE.黄艳玲
