【15】A 2-months-old male was referred to the Dermatology and Venereology clinic in Sanglah General Hospital, Denpasar, Bali, with suspect haemangioma. The patient’s family complained of a red lump arising on the right leg, abdomen and back. Initially the lump was on the right leg, then spread to the abdomen and back 2 weeks ago after receiving an immunization injection at that site. The lump is getting bigger and very painful when touched and it makes the baby cry even more. The family said, there were already non-swollen, painless and flat red spots that were visible from birth at the right thigh, right side of abdomen, and right side of the lower back 删除33：<u></u>.

    Kasabach-Merritt syndrome

【20】From physical examination we observed a purplish red solitary tumor with smooth and shiny surface, unclear borders, size 15 × 27 cm, with a dense consistency, petechiae scattered around the tumor on the right leg, scrotum, abdomen and the right side of lower back.

【21】Laboratory investigations: we found abnormality of lymphocytes count 1.43 (1.8–9 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /L), erythrocyte 1.27 (4.10–5.3 × 10 <sup>6 </sup> /⎧L), hemoglobin 3.2 (12.0–16.0 g/dL), haematocrit 11.2 (37.0–48.0%), thrombocyte 11 (140–440 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μL).

【22】The final diagnosis for this patient is Kasabach-Merritt syndrome.

【23】The treatment consists of methylprednisolone 2 mg/kgBW/day (3 × 3.5 mg) intraorally for 14 days. We also plan to give transfusion of 35 ml packed red blood cells (PRC) and a 50 ml transfusion of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) immediately.

【24】Discussion
----------

【25】Kasabach-Merritt syndrome (KMS) is a rare case and early suspicion is required for an early treatment especially in coagulopathy which is a life threatening condition to patients. This condition needs supportive care and medication choices before proceeding with surgical or other interventional medications 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 1 \]</u>. In this patient we found the count of platelet, erythrocyte haemoglobin and haematocrit were in critical value.

【26】Recently, there were no specific guidelines established to treat the KMS. The medication choices in KMS are varied, such as early management of coagulopathy and aggressive supportive care, systemic corticosteroids , systemic chemotherapy, immunomodulators, and surgical management 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 2 \]</u>.

【27】Efficacy of corticosteroids in management of KMS has been validated in multiple clinical trials. Infantile haemangioma derived stem cells demonstrated that corticosteroids lead to suppression of the factors that are known as targets of nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) such as vascular endothelial growth factor, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, urokinase plasminogen activator receptor, and interleukin-6. The initial dosing and the type of corticosteroids used in KMS vary based on the case series or case reports published 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 3 , 4 \]</u>.

【28】In this patient we give supportive care such as PRC and FFP transfusion immediately to recover the general condition. We also give systemic corticosteroid (methylprednisolone). From 7 days of follow up, the clinical symptoms show that KMS was improved and responsive to our management. It can be seen by increased platelet count and reduced tumor size. The patient is surviving and still needs an advanced treatment modality such as surgery. Recently, the treatment of KMS is still challenging, and more studies are required to summarize a clearly successful treatment as a guideline in the future 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 5 \]</u>.
