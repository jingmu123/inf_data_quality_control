【17】D. Previous vaccination reaction that consisted of wheezing and hypotension

【18】5.1 B. It is critical to understand the normal milestones for gross motor， fine motor， speech， and social categories. Delay in one or more areas can indicate problems which if addressed can alleviate long-term issues. Most 6-month-old infants would be expected to sit without support. They would also be expected to transfer objects from one hand to the other， roll from a prone to supine posi-tion， babble， and recognize strangers.

【19】5.2 D. A child who is older than 2 years may sit in a forward-facing car seat in the back seat of the car. A child who weighs more than 40 lb is usually big enough to use a booster seat， also in the back seat of the car.

【20】5.3 A. DTaP is routinely recommended at 2， 4， 6， 12 to 18 months， and 4 to 6 years. Oral polio vaccination is no longer routinely recommended in children； the inactivated， injectable polio vaccine is recommended in its place and is recom-mended at 2，4， 6 to 18 months， and 4 to 6 years. MMR and varicella vaccination are recommended at 12 to 15 months and 4 to 6 years.

【21】5.4 D. A previous anaphylactic reaction is a true contraindication to vaccination. Minor illnesses or vaccination reactions， even with fever， are not contraindica-tions. Penicillin is not a component of vaccines and history of allergy to this medication is not a contraindication.

【22】True contraindications to providing vaccinations are rare；acute care visits are an excellent opportunity to provide childhood vaccinations.
