【11】18.3Which one of the following recommendations is accurate regarding the cur-rent USPSTF recommendation for osteoporosis screening in the elderly?

【12】A. All women with strong risk factors， regardless of age， should be screened for osteoporosis.

【13】B.Only women above the age of 65 should be screened for osteoporosis.

【14】C. Men and women above the age of 65 should be screened for osteoporo-sis.

【15】D. African-American race is an independent risk factor for osteoporosis and should warrant screening regardless of other risk factors.

【16】ANSWERS

【17】18.1 F A. The only accurate answer among the choices is that regarding colorectal screening. There is no recommendation for annual routine PSA testing for prostate cancer screening. Pap smears can be safely discontinued in women over the age of 65 who have had adequate prior screening. The herpes zoster vaccine is recommended for routine use at age 60 or older.

【18】18.2 C. Up to one-third of people older than age 65 suffer from hearing loss.Pres-bycusis typically presents with symmetric high-frequency hearing loss. There is loss of speech discrimination， so that patients complain of difficulty under-standing rapid speech， foreign accents， and conversation in noisy areas. The mechanism is sensorineural rather than a conductive problem.

【19】18.3A. USPSTF recommends screening for osteoporosis in women above 65 years and younger than 65 years with risk factors. Therefore， considering age as a risk factor， essentially all women with risk factors must be screened for osteoporosis with bone mineral density test or DEXA scan. The current recommendation applies only to women， as there is insufficient evidence to support screening in men， and the race mostly at risk is Caucasian.

【20】CLINICALPEARLS

【21】Protein undernutrition is associated with an increased risk of infections. anemia， orthostatic hypotension， and decubitus ulcers.
Smoking is associated with osteoporosis.

【22】If"osteoporotic”fractures， such as vertebral compression fractures，occur in conjunction with osteopenia on x-ray， the diagnosis ofosteoporosis is almost certain.

【23】Hearing loss and sensory impairments， in general， can be confused with cognitive impairment or an affective disorder.

【24】Presbyopia， macular degeneration， glaucoma， cataracts， and diabetic retinopathy account for the majority of conditions leading to vision loss in the elderly.王磊
