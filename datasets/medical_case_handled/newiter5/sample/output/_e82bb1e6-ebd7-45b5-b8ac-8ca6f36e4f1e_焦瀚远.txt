【0】Question: A worried mother brings her infant to the emergency department because he appears to be unable to swallow and continues to choke on his formula. On physical examination, the physician notes generalized muscle weakness. On further questioning, the patient’s mother says that she recently started sweetening the baby’s food with honey. Which of the following is a characteristic of the organism most likely responsible for this infant’s symptoms?

【1】> (A) Production of IgA protease

【2】> (B) Production of exotoxin A

【3】> (C) Production of lecithinase

【4】> (D) Production of lipopolysaccharide

【5】> (E) Production of spores that can only be killed by autoclaving

【6】 Answer: The correct answer is E. This describes all spore-forming bacteria, which include Bacillus anthracis, Bacillus cereus , and Clostridium . However, only Clostridium botulinum produces the symptoms seen in this baby and also fits the mode of transmission. C botulinum causes botulism via the production of a heat-labile toxin that inhibits the release of acetylcholine into the neuromuscular junction. Infants may initially become constipated and then develop generalized muscle weakness (“floppy baby”). The organism is spread through the ingestion of contaminated canned or bottled food. Additionally, fresh honey has been shown to harbor the organism.  
Answer A is incorrect. IgA protease is produced by some bacteria so they can cleave secretory IgA and colonize mucosal areas; Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae , and Haemophilus influenzae are the most well known. However, none of these are typically transmitted via food, namely honey.  
Answer B is incorrect. Exotoxin A is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as some Streptococcus species. Exotoxin A has been associated with toxic shock syndrome and scarlet fever. However, none of these organisms produce the symptoms seen in this case or is transmitted by honey ingestion.  
Answer C is incorrect. Lecithinase is produced by Clostridium perfringens and is responsible for the development of gas gangrene, cellulitis, and diarrhea. This organism is associated with contaminated wounds, which is not a part of this baby’s history.  
Answer D is incorrect. Lipopolysaccharide, also called endotoxin, is produced by gramnegative bacteria and Listeria . It is highly anti-genic and can cause sepsis in severe infections. However, generalized muscle weakness is not characteristic of sepsis.焦瀚远
