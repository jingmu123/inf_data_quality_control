【0】Are There Contraindications to the Use of TRT?
----------------------------------------------

【1】We do not prescribe TRT to patients with a history of prostate or breast cancer, erythrocytosis (hematocrit ≥50–52%), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) >4 ng/dL or >3 ng/dL in the presence of family history of prostate cancer, abnormalities on digital rectal exam, or a lower urinary tract symptoms score (LUTS) >19 using the International Prostate Symptom Score modified from the American Urological Association  通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 1 , 33 \]</u>. Despite the knowledge that the prostate is responsive to testosterone in terms of growth and PSA production 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 34 , 35 \]</u>, there is no evidence that hypogonadal men receiving TRT experience an increased risk of prostate cancer or symptomatic BPH 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 36 , 37 \]</u>. Before prescribing TRT we clinically assess the presence of familial or personal predisposition to thromboembolic events 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 38 \]</u> and whether the patient is affected by untreated obstructive sleep apnea 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 1 \]</u>.

【3】Studies have been controversial as to whether TRT affects CV risk. This issue will not be conclusively clarified until the conclusion of the ongoing TRAVERSE trial 删除10：<u></u>, expected in 2025. It should be noted that the US Food and Drug Administration issued a safety warning in 2015, requiring all testosterone products to include a black box describing the possible increased risk of CV events associated with testosterone use. We recommend complying with the Endocrine Society guidelines and not offer TRT to patients who experienced a cardiovascular episode in the last 6 months or are affected by active angina or poorly controlled congestive heart failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 1 \]</u>. The most frequently occurring adverse event from TRT is erythrocytosis, with an relative risk of 8.14 according to a meta-analysis from 1579 patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 37 \]</u>. Men seeking fertility should be informed of the suppressive effect on spermatogenesis exerted by TRT 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 1 \]</u>.

【4】What Testosterone Formulation Should Be Used?
---------------------------------------------

【5】In the USA, there is access to transdermal, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intranasal, buccal, or pellet implant formulations of testosterone . More elderly individuals are typically started with a transdermal preparation, titrated to a mid-normal level of TT (approximately 500–600 ng/dL). Intramuscular (IM) testosterone esters (depot) are recommended for patients requiring large doses of transdermal testosterone to reach the goal concentration, such as >4 daily actuations of transdermal gel. Patients should be counseled on how to avoid transfer of topical testosterone to children or women by skin contact.

【6】Alternative Therapies
---------------------

【7】Aromatase inhibitors (AI) or selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) such as clomiphene and enclomiphene have been used, but they are not recommended due to a paucity of large and reproducible randomized clinical trials. AI are widely used off-label in the USA, but we do not recommend their use because they prevent formation of estradiol, which is important for bone and sexual health, and prevention of accumulation of fat. Similarly, human chorionic gonadotropin or other androgenic formulations have not been sufficiently investigated and should not be used for functional hypogonadism.

【8】Monitoring
----------

【9】The Endocrine Society guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 1 \]</u> recommend measuring testosterone, hematocrit, and PSA after 3 and 12 months on therapy. Serum testosterone should be measured midway between injections when using IM testosterone esters (depot) or 2 hours after application of a gel. We request a urological consultation in patients with a palpable prostate nodule or induration; PSA concentration of >4 ng/mL, or >3 ng/mL if at high risk, for serum PSA concentration increases of >1.4 ng/mL within any 12-month period of TRT ; or PSA velocity of >0.4 ng/mL/year using the PSA level obtained after 6 months of T administration as the reference 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 1 \]</u>. We engage all patients in the decision-making of monitoring for prostate cancer and follow the guidelines of the American Urological Association and Endocrine Society. We monitor for the presence of LUTS 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 1 \]</u> and refer to a urologist for an increase of IPS score to >19. For patients developing erythrocytosis, we recommend changing to a transdermal formulation, decreasing the testosterone dose, discontinuing treatment altogether, or enrolling the patient in a regular blood donation program. We discontinue the treatment in patients developing a cardiovascular event during TRT.

【10】Conclusion
----------

【11】The diagnosis of hypogonadism requires characteristic symptoms as well as biochemical evidence of low testosterone. The decision to treat functional hypogonadism in aging male patients requires careful consideration of the risk to benefit ratio and monitoring of symptom improvement and safety parameters.苏锦恭
