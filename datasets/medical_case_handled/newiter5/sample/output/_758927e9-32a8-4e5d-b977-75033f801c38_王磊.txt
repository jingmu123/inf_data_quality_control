【0】Question: A visibly upset 15-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department because he punched a wall and now has pain in his hand. The physician tells the patient that he has broken his hand. Which of the following is the most likely site of this patient’s fracture?

【1】> (A) Distal radius

【2】> (B) Hamate

【3】> (C) Metacarpals

【4】> (D) Phalanges

【5】> (E) Scaphoid

【6】 Answer: The correct answer is C . This patient most likely has a “boxer’s fracture,” which occurs when individuals strike a blow with a closed fist against a hard, unyielding object. The most commonly injured sites for experienced boxers are the first and second metacarpals, whereas for others, the neck of the fifth metacarpal is the most common site of injury. The metacarpals have a good blood supply and thus heal rapidly.  
Answer A is incorrect . A complete transverse fracture of the distal radius is called Colles’ fracture. This occurs most commonly in the elderly after forced dorsiflexion. It results in avulsion of the styloid process from the shaft of the radius. The radius may be shortened, and the styloid process of the ulna may project farther distally than the styloid process of the radius. The forearm and hand may exhibit a “dinner fork” deformity as a result of the posterior displacement of the distal part of the radius.  
Answer B is incorrect . Fracture of the hamate is not common but can be complicated, as the ulnar nerve can often be injured. Patients with an ulnar nerve lesion at the wrist may have an ulnar claw hand, which is caused by a weakness of the medial two lumbricals that flex at the metacarpophalangeal joints and extend at the interphalangeal joints of the ring and little fingers. Patients will also experience weakness in the ability to abduct or adduct fingers or adduct the thumb at the metacarpophalangeal joints (interosseous muscles and adductor pollicis). They are unable to hold a piece of paper between the thumb and index finger or between adjacent fingers. Weakness of the interosseous muscles may also result in a slight clawing of the index and middle fingers. The muscles in the hypothenar eminence may also be affected; patients experience weakness in flexion, abduction, and opposition of the fifth finger. Altered sensation in skin of the medial aspect of the hand and medial digits may be evident. There are healing difficulties associated with this type of fracture.  
Answer D is incorrect . Fracture of the phalanges is a common injury and is often due to crushing or hyperextension injuries.  
Answer E is incorrect . Fracture of the scaphoid commonly occurs when individuals fall onto an outstretched hand. The scaphoid is the most commonly fractured carpal bone, and patients may exhibit pain and tenderness localized over the anatomic snuffbox.王磊
