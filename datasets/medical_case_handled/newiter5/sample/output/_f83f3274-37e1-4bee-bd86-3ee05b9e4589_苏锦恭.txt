【0】CASE 11

【1】Several new drugs are being tested for their effects on B-adrenergic receptors. The investigator plots an S-shaped curve of the activity of adenylate cyclase vs. drug dose in response to drug A. When the response of drug D is similarly plotted， D is found to have a lower median effective dose (EDs) and a lower maximal response than A. In the presence of drug A plus drug B， the curve has the same shape

| CASE 11 Several new drugs are being tested for their effects on B-adrenergic receptors. The investigator plotsan S-shaped curve of the activity of adenylate cyclase vs. drug dose in response to drug A. When theresponse of drug D is similarly plotted， D is found to have a lower median effective dose (EDs) and alower maximal response than A. In the presence of drug A plus drug B， the curve has the same shapebut is now shifted to the right. In the presence of drug A plus drug C， the curve is not shifted， but the maximal response is lower.  |

| Which drug is more potent? Drug D is more potent 删除33：<u></u>. Potency is the amount of drug required for a specified response.Typically， potency is measured by the EDs， or the dose that gives 50% of the maximal response. The lowerthe EDso， the more potent the drug.  |

| What type of antagonist is drug C? Drug C is a noncompetitive antagonist 删除33：<u></u>. These drugs act by binding irreversibly to a site onthe receptor distinct from the site of agonist binding. Noncompetitive antagonists do not affect the EDsbut do affect the maximal response (decrease efficacy) that the agonist can elicit.  |
| --- |
| How can the effect of drug B be overcome? Since competitive antagonists bind at the same site as the agonist， their action can be overcome byincreasing agonist dose. If enough agonist is present， the same efficacy can be reached that the agonisthad in the absence of an antagonist.  |苏锦恭
