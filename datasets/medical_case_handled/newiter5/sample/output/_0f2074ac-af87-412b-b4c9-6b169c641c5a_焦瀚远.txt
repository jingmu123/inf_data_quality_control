The past history was otherwise unremarkable. His father died  删除换行1 from cancer at the age of 45 years, but he is unsure of the origin.

【12】ANSWER 11
A sessile mass is seen occupying approximately half of the bowel wall circumference. A  删除换行5 biopsy of the lesion should be taken at the time of sigmoidoscopy to confirm the diagnosis of  删除换行1 rectal cancer.

【13】Blood tests including full blood count, liver function tests and tumour markers (e.g. carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA]) should be arranged. An urgent colonoscopy is required to determine whether there are any synchronous cancers (5 per cent) or synchronous polyps (75 per  删除换行1 cent) in the rest of the large bowel.

【14】The patient should be staged using computerized tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen  删除换行1 to check for chest, mediastinal and intra-abdominal metastases. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis is used to ascertain the depth of tumour invasion through the rectal  删除换行1 wall and any regional nodal metastases. For tumours located above approximately 5 cm from  删除换行1 the anal verge, an anterior resection is carried out with or without a temporary defunctioning  删除换行1 stoma. If the tumour is less than 5 cm from the anal verge, then abdomino-perineal resection  删除换行1 of the anus and rectum maybe required with a permanent end colostomy.

【15】For tumours penetrating the rectal wall, preoperative radiotherapy is beneficial, and more  删除换行1 recently a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy has been advocated for some  删除换行1 tumours.General and Colorectal焦瀚远
