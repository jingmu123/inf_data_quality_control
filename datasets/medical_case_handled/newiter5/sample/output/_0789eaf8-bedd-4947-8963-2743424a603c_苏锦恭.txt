【6】Case
----

【7】A 27-year-old male with generalized plaque psoriasis worst on the lower legs presents for follow up. He has been doing NB-UVB phototherapy 3 times per week in the office for the past year with great improvement of psoriasis on his trunk. However, he continues to have stubborn plaques on both of his shins. In addition to regular phototherapy, he uses topical corticosteroids to these stubborn areas with minimal additional improvement. He is very bothered by the appearance of his lower legs and the fact that he cannot wear shorts or go to the beach without being embarrassed. The patient states that the 3 times per week phototherapy regimen has been manageable with his schedule and he can continue treatments; however, he would like these resistant plaques to go away. One examination, he has well-demarcated, thick erythematous plaques with minimal scale on the bilateral shins and ankles. His chest, abdomen, and back are clear of psoriasis.

【8】In order to further improve the psoriasis on his lower legs, the patient is started on a two-step phototherapy regimen. During each treatment session, the trunk and extremities are first treated as per protocol. Then all of his skin except for the lower legs is covered with a gown and towels, and he is again exposed to light, starting at a low dose and increasing per protocol. He is also instructed to step on a stool in the phototherapy booth to improve irradiation to the lower legs. With this two-step regimen, the patient returns 3 months later with near clearance of the stubborn plaques on his lower legs.

【9】Discussion
----------

【10】It is not uncommon for patients to have only a partial response to UVB phototherapy. Typically, adequate improvement of disease is seen on the trunk, but treatment response may be poor on the distal extremities 删除33：<u></u>. In such cases, instead of declaring that these patients have “failed” UVB, the two-step approach can be utilized 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 1 \]</u>.

【13】In the two-step approach, patients will first receive phototherapy as usual to the whole body for overall exposure (the face and genitals should be covered if there is no disease in these areas). After completing this portion of the treatment session, the patient will come out of the booth and cover areas of the body with lower MED such as the trunk. Since the extremities can generally tolerate more light than the trunk, the patient will then re-enter the phototherapy booth to receive an additional dose of the light to the extremities 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 2 \]</u> 删除33：<u></u>. The second step of this two-step regimen should be started at low dose and increased as tolerated per protocol. Examples of how this two-step phototherapy can be effectively documented in the patients’ medical records are illustrated in Table 12.1 .

【16】In the present patient who has recalcitrant psoriasis plaques on the lower legs, in addition to the above two-step approach whereby he receives additional dosage of light to the legs, it may also be helpful for the patient to step on a stool to elevate himself while in the booth 删除33：<u></u>. This is because the top and bottom of the UV lamps have much lower intensity of radiation compared to the middle 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 3 \]</u>. Ironically, patients end up receiving less UV exposure in precisely the areas that need it the most. By elevating the patient within the booth, the amount of irradiation to the legs may improve, leading to better outcomes.

【18】It can be beneficial for the patient to elevate oneself on a step-stool to increase the dose of light received on the lower legs, as the intensity of radiation is less at the top and bottom of the UV lamps</u>苏锦恭
