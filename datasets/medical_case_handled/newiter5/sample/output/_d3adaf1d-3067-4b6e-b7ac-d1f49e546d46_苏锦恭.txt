【0】Question: In a discussion with his psychiatrist, a university student reveals an obsession with a fellow student. He also notes he intends to purchase a gun but does not clearly state why. Whom must the physician be sure is contacted?

【1】> (A) Law enforcement authorities only

【2】> (B) Law enforcement authorities and the fellow student

【3】> (C) No one; the physician is bound by confidentiality

【4】> (D) The fellow student only

【5】> (E) The patient’s parents

【6】 Answer: The correct answer is B. Patients entrust their physicians with highly personal information, and a physician who discloses such information without consent can be held liable. However, there are exceptions to the legal protection of confidentiality, such as the need to report certain infectious diseases or to warn third parties known to be at risk of harm. The information presented in this question is based on Tarasoff v. Regents of the University of California 通用删除7(英):<u>(1976)</u>, in which a student was murdered by a patient who implied his intentions to his psychiatrist. The Supreme Court ruled in a rehearing that “confidentiality ends with public peril” and that third parties must be informed in such cases.  
Answer A is incorrect. The physician must also make sure the potential victim is notified.  
Answer C is incorrect. This choice is perhaps the most seductive but is also the most frankly inappropriate. A physician has a legal obligation to protect the public from “peril” according to the Supreme Court of the United States, regardless of the breach of confidentiality required to do so.  
Answer D is incorrect. The physician must also make sure law enforcement officials are notified.  
Answer E is incorrect. Notifying the patient’s parents is unnecessary and would be an unwarranted breach in patient confidentiality.苏锦恭
