【61】The National Pulmonary Hypertension Centres of the UK and Ireland Physicians Committee recommendations (Thorax 2008 63(suppl ii)：1-41)：

【62】●Chest radiography to looking for increase in cardiac chambers， increased pulmonary artery size， hypoperfused areas of lung and evidence of parenchymal lung disease.
删除14：<u>Q</u>
34FPrimary pulmonary hypertension

【63】● High-resolution CT of lungs to look for parenchymal lung disease， mosaic perfusion (a sign of pulmonary vascular embolism or thrombosis but LOr for which there are other causes such as air trapping) and features of pulmonary venous hypertension.

【64】CT pulmonary angiography to look for enlargement of pulmonary arter-ies， filling defects and webs in the arteries. Detects enlarged bronchial circulation.

【65】Ventilation-perfusion scanning is more sensitive for chronic pulmonary thromboembolism than CT pulmonary angiography but is not helpful when there is underlying parenchymal lung disease.

【66】Selective pulmonary angiography by direct injection of the pulmonary arteries (Echocardiography is the screening tool of choice as it detects cardiac disease (congenital， myocardial， valvular， intracavity clot or tumour， pericardial). Use of contrast may be helpful to identify shunts.

【67】Cardiac MRI is a good tool for imaging the RV and is helpful in delineat-ing congenital heart defects， and the pulmonary circulationby angiography.

【68】Abdominal ultrasound is used for investigation of liver disease and suspected portal hypertension.

【69】What are the pathological features of primary pulmonary hypertension?

【70】They are those of plexogenic pulmonary arteriopathy (which also occurs in post-tricuspid left-to-right atrial shunts such as ventricular septal defect or patent ductus arteriosus， and collagen vascular diseases)， characterized by medial hypertrophy and concentric intimal fibrosis of the pulmonary arteries with complex plexiform lesions. Others have no plexiform lesions or concentric intimal fibrosis but rather have recanalized thrombotic small pulmonary arteries， which are said to be caused by small thrombi or recur-rent emboli. The least common histological pattern is veno-occlusive disease.

【71】What are the theories for the cause of primary pulmonary hypertension?

【72】●\]Excess endothelial production of the vasoconstrictor thromboxane rela-tive to dilator prostaglandins such as prostaglandin I2 (prostacyclin)

【73】●Excess endothelin-1 levels relative to nitric oxide. Inhaled nitric oxide and endothelin-1 antagonists reduce pulmonary hypertension

【74】Excessive thrombosis in situ caused by increased platelet activation， plasminogen activator inhibitor levels and decreased thrombomodulin

【75】●Increased sertonin levels删除31：<u>●</u>Inhibition or down regulation of potassium (Kv) channels in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells and platelets 删除换行5 Activation of elastase and matrix metalloprotease， which enhances pro-duction of mitogens

【76】●Monoclonal proliferation of endothelial cells.

【77】What is the prognosis in pulmonary hypertension?

【78】Untreated prognosis is poor， with median survival of approximately3 years from the time of diagnosis， with about one-third of patients 删除换行4 34Primary pulmonary hypertension 删除换行1 surviving for 5 years. Death usually occurs suddenly， presumably from arrhythmias or right ventricular infarction.
删除14：<u>A</u>删除14：<u>Q</u>

【79】What are the predictors of survival?

【80】These include indicators of severity of diseases as assessed by measure-ment of haemodynamic characteristics (mean pulmonary-artery pressure， right atrial pressure， cardiac index and mixed venous oxygen concentra-tion)， functional class， exercise tolerance (6-min walk test)， anticoagulant therapy and the response to vasodilators. Most patients succumb to pro-gressive right-sided failure， but sudden death accounts for approximately7% of deaths.

【81】What treatment is available for primary pulmonary hypertension?

【82】●1Diuretics： useful in reducing excessive preload in patients with right heart failure， particularly when hepatic congestion and ascites are present.

【83】Oral anticoagulants： warfarin is the anticoagulant of choice， in doses adjusted to achieve an international normalized ratio (INR) of approxi-mately 2.0. Anticoagulants nearly double the 3-year survival rate 删除10：<u>(Cir-culation 1984；70：580-7)</u>.

【84】● Calcium channel blockers (nifedipine， diltiazem)： patients who respond to calcium channel blockers have a 5-year survival rate of 95% 删除10：<u>(N Engl J Med 1992；327：76-81)</u>.

【85】Intravenous epoprostenol (formerly prostacyclin)： potent short-acting vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation that is natually pro-duced by the vascular endothelium 删除10：<u>(N Engl J Med 1996；334：296-301，N EnglJ Med 1998；338：273-7)</u>.

【86】Atrial septostomy： the creation of a right-to-left shunt by blade-balloon atrial septostomy has been reported to improve forward output and alleviate right-sided heart failure by providing blood with a low-resistance channel， thereby decompressing the right atrium and impro-ving filling of the left side of the heart 删除10：<u>(Circulation 1995；91：2028-35)</u>.

【87】● Lung transplantation and combined heart-lung transplantation： sur-vivalrates after the two procedures are similar. Even markedly depressed right ventricular function improves considerably with single-or double-lung transplantation.

【88】Other drugs：

【89】●UT-15， a prostaglandin I analogue， has shown to have sustained and favourable effects in patients when administered subcutaneously(Circulation 2000；102(supplII)：101).

【90】●Sitaxsentan， an oral selective endothelin A receptor blocker has been shown to produce sustained improvements in pulmonary artery pressure (Circulation 2000；102(supplII)：427).

【91】●PPARy-activating agents： data suggest that the genes involved in devel-opment of pulmonary hypertension are targets of the insulin-sensitizing transcriptionfactor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Y(PPARy)， and that PPARy activation could lead to their beneficial induc-tion or repression and subsequent antiproliferative， anti-inflammatory， proapoptotic and direct vasodilatory effects in the vasculature. PPARy acts downstream of bone morphogenetic protein receptor II (BMP-RII)， which is the cell surface receptor that is mutated or dysfunctional in many forms of pulmonary hypertension. Insulin resistance may be 删除换行1 an environmental risk factor or disease modifier (second hit’)； it has， therefore， been suggested thatPPARy-activating agents might be beneficial in the future treatment of both insulin-resistant and insulin-sensitive PAH patients with or without BMP-RII mutations 删除10：<u>(Sci Transl Med 2009；1：12-14)</u>.
