【0】CASE 40: SLOW ASYMPTOMATIC DEPIGMENTATION

【1】OF THE SKIN

【2】History

【3】A 23-year-old African Caribbean man presents with a 2-year history of gradual patchy  删除换行1 lightening of the skin. He denies any symptoms such as itching or irritation of his skin  删除换行1 prior to the onset of the whitening patches. He has no previous history of skin problems  删除换行1 but had suffered with mild asthma as a child. He is otherwise well and does not take  删除换行1 medication. There is a family history of thyroid disease.
Examination

【4】There are multiple, well-demarcated, non-scaly macules of depigmentation in a symmetrical distribution, predominantly over the trunk 删除33：<u></u>. The periorbital, perioral  删除换行1 and genital areas are also affected. Some of the macules have tiny pigmented spots within  删除换行1 them.

【6】Questions

【7】• What is the diagnosis?

【8】• What are the different presentations of  删除换行1 this disease?

【9】• How should this patient be managed?
ANSWER 40

【10】This patient presented with depigmentation (leucoderma) which was asymptomatic and  删除换行1 symmetrical. Causes of hypopigmentation include albinism, hypopituitarism, chemical  删除换行1 leucoderma such as with phenolics, and post-inflammatory change secondary to inflammatory dermatoses such as eczema. Onset in this patient was in adulthood (acquired) with  删除换行1 gradual deterioration, which led to the diagnosis of vitiligo.

【11】Vitiligo is a depigmenting acquired disease that occurs due to loss of epidermal melanocytes. Vitiligo has been reported to be associated with autoimmune disease including  删除换行1 thyroid disease, pernicious anaemia and type 1 diabetes mellitus. The cause of vitiligo is,  删除换行1 however, unknown. It affects 1 per cent of the population, usually occurring between the  删除换行1 ages of 10 and 30 years. Vitiligo affects all racial groups, but is particularly distressing  删除换行1 in those with darker skin.

【12】Vitiligo is characterized by sharply defined pale/white macules. Most commonly affected  删除换行1 are periorbital, perioral and anogenital areas, but also the axillae, inguinal regions and  删除换行1 extensor sites of the knees/elbows. Symmetrical involvement is the norm. In addition,  删除换行1 white hair and prematurely grey hair can occur.
There are several types: a focal type which is characterized by one or more macules;  删除换行1 segmental vitiligo occurs when the disease develops unilaterally, for instance, down one  删除换行1 leg; generalized or universal disease can also occur. In patients with lighter skin where  删除换行1 the contrast between disease and normal skin is less obvious, then a Wood’s light can be  删除换行1 very helpful to evaluate the macules.
The course of vitiligo is variable; however, most patients’ course is quite rapid at  删除换行1 the onset followed by a period of stability. Treatments are generally unsatisfactory.
Photoprotective advice is essential for involved skin. Cosmetic camouflage can be useful.
To induce repigmentation, topical corticosteroids and topical calcineurin inhibitors such  删除换行1 as tacrolimus can be effective for focal lesions. For more extensive disease phototherapy  删除换行1 including psoralen–UVA and narrow-band UVB are effective in some patients. Response  删除换行1 to phototherapy is usually evidenced initially by follicular repigmentation where tiny  删除换行1 macular dots of pigmented skin are seen. In extensive disease, patients may be offered  删除换行1 depigmentation of their remaining normal skin using monobezyl ether or hydroquinone.

【13】 KEY POINTS

【14】• Vitiligo occurs due to loss of epidermal melanocytes.

【15】• It has been reported to be associated with autoimmune disease.

【16】• Focal, segmental and generalized types exist.苏锦恭
