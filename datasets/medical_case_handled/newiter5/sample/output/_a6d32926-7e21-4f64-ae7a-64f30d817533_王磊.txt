【11】A 1½-month-old boy is presented for a visit because of recurrent febrile episodes since he was 2 weeks old. Previously he was hospitalized in another pediatric clinic where all investigations performed (laboratory tests, microbiological tests, bone marrow examination, x-rays, ultrasound scans, etc.) were negative. The family reported that the child was irritable and didn’t tolerate heat, cried with few or no tears, and seemed not to sweat. The family history was negative, the pregnancy had been normal, with physiological delivery at full term.

【12】On physical examination, the child presented normal growth percentiles. His appearance was abnormal 删除33：<u></u>, his hair was sparse, eyelashes and eyebrows were absent. His skin, thin and very pale, was particularly wrinkled on the eyelids and lips. No other abnormalities were observed, in particularly the nails was normal.

【15】At that time, we made no further investigations. We recommended avoiding high environmental temperatures, dressing him lightly and washing him frequently on hot days, without drying him. We also prescribed the use of artificial tears and a physiological solution to moisten the nose and ears. We informed the family that later dental prostheses would be needed and we put them in contact with other specialists to better address any foreseeable aesthetic, functional and psychological problems.

【16】At 6, the boy had normal body weight and regular psychomotor development. The appearance of the face remained the same: the forehead was very wide, the root of the nose was deformed like a “saddle”, eyelashes and eyebrows were absent, the lips was everted 删除33：<u></u>. His hair was sparse with areas of alopecia 删除33：<u></u>. The teeth were few and conical 删除33：<u></u>.

【27】Discussion
----------

【28】The “saddle” nose and the alterations of the lips could suggest a diagnosis of syphilis. However, these sequelae in the case of syphilis tend to appear later. Furthermore the particular phenotype of our patient, as well as hypodontia, conical teeth and other clinical features described ruled out the diagnosis of congenital syphilis.

【29】In Ellis van Creveld syndrome , dental changes with partial agenesis or conical teeth can be observed. However, this syndrome is also characterized by short stature, congenital heart disease, typical skeletal manifestations and polydactyly 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 1 \]</u> which are absent in our case.

【30】Tricho-dento-osseous (TDO) syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterised by curly hair at infancy, anomalies of the eyelashes and eyebrows, hypoplasia and taurodontism of teeth, sclerotic bone, palmar and plantar keratosis, “café au lait” spots with normal sweating 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 2 \]</u>. Our patient presented only some of these manifestations.

【31】Ectodermal dysplasias (Eds) is a genetic heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by developmental dystrophies of ectodermal structures. They mainly affect the hair, nails, teeth and sweat glands. Over 190 varieties have been described 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 3 – 5 \]</u>.

【32】Ectodermal dysplasia anhydrotic (EDA) is the most common among Eds.

【33】It includes three subtypes, not clinically differentiable, which show, as a cardinal sign, a sweating disorder:

【34】1.  1.
    Christ-Siemens-Touraine syndrome (X-linked). Associated with EDA gene (Xq12-q13.1)
2.  2.
    Autosomal dominant EDA. Associated with the EDAR gene (2q13)
3.  3.
    Autosomal recessive EDA. Associated with the EDARADD gene (1q42.3)

【35】A fourth rare subtype is known, EDA with immunodeficiency.

【36】Christ-Siemens-Touraine syndrome (CST) is the most common subtype (80%) and its incidence in males is estimated at 1 in 50,000–100,000 births 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 5 \]</u>.

【37】It is characterized by the triad of signs comprising sparse hair (atrichosis or hypotrichosis), abnormal or missing teeth (anodontia or hypodontia) and inability to sweat due to lack of sweat glands ( anhidrosis or hypohidrosis ). All these symptoms were present in our patient.

【38】The autosomic recessive and dominant forms affect both sexes equally. In the X-linked form, carrier females may be asymptomatic or have a milder phenotype: oligodontia , conical incisors, hypotrichosis , and reduced sweating.

【39】The defective sweating ability often leads to recurrent hyperthermic episodes (recurrent fever not otherwise explained) and heat intolerance . The recurrent hyperthermic episodes are commonly the initial presentation causing the request for medical intervention 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 6 \]</u>. Dry skin and eczematous dermatitis, decreased teas, and photophobia are common while onychodystrophy is not frequent.

【40】Most patients with EDA have a normal life expectancy. However, the hyperthermia may be followed by brain damage in early infancy, if unrecognized. Thus an early diagnosis is very important. The aim of the treatment is to restore the function and the aesthetics of the teeth 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 7 \]</u>. As long as there are no physical, psychological or social burdens, no treatment is necessary.

【41】Key Points

【42】   Recurrent fever, secondary to anhidrosis or hypohidrosis, may occur in the neonatal period as the first sign of Ectodermal dysplasia anhydrotic
   Infant affected may show typical face with wide forehead, “saddle” nose, absence of eyelashes and eyebrows, everted lips early
   Most patients with EDA have a normal life expectancy. However, the hyperthermia may be followed by brain damage in early infancy, if unrecognized.王磊
