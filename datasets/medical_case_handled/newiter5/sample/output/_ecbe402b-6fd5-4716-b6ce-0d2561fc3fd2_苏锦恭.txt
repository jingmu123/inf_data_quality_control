--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

【1】A 3-year-old male was presented with an unremarkable personal, allergy, and family history.

【2】He presented on Day 20 of illness, with a history of stomachache for 20 days, along with fever and cough for more than 10 days, and body edema for 10 days. He came in with a 20-day history of abdominal pain described as intermittent lower abdominal pain, with fever up to 39 °C, along with pharyngalgia. He was given infusion of first-generation cephalosporin for 1 day and erythromycin for 3 days at a local clinic, and then fever regressed. On Day 5, he had fever again and developed paroxysmal coughing with wheezing which was more serious in the morning and at night. He was treated with first-generation cephalosporin again for 7 days, the fever subsided. But he developed facial and body edema, and oliguria. Vitamin C was given one time and azithromycin infusion was given for 1 day. His facial edema, cough, and wheezing all deteriorated, and dyspnea was developed. After he received diuretics for 2 days and took traditional Chinese medication for 7 days, his edema improved. Sputum could be coughed up easily. But he still had cough with wheezing at night. The patient was fatigue, pale, sweaty when moving. He was hospitalized at a local hospital. The chest DR showed cardiomegaly. Echo showed significantly enlarged left ventricle, weak wall movement, and mild pericardial effusion. He was transferred to our pediatric cardiology ward as a patient with dilated cardiomyopathy. Since the onset of illness, he had to sleep on his right side and gradually had oliguria. Examination revealed his mental state was bad, pale, dyspnea. Axillary temperature 36 °C, HR 96 bpm, RR 35 bpm. His weight was 15 kg. Physical examination found congested pharynx and tonsil. Auscultation of lungs revealed some phlegm sound. Precordial area was uplifted and heart sound was weak. Abdominal area was soft with slight tenderness in umbilical region. Liver enlarged 3 cm below the margin of right costal, spleen enlarged 2 cm below left costal margin, moderate hard. Edema was in bilateral lower limbs. Peripheral oxygen saturation was 96%. Others were normal. Admission blood test revealed a normal complete blood count, slightly elevated NT-pro BNP 2557 pg/mL, venous blood gas analysis PH7.33, PO <sub>2 </sub> 49.4 mmHg, PCO <sub>2 </sub> 39.6 mmHg, BE −5.3 mmol/L, arterial oxygen saturation was 82.6%, serum potassium was 3.8 mmol/L. ECG showed decremented R <sub>V1 </sub> , R <sub>V3 </sub> , and R <sub>V5 </sub> , abnormal LV Q wave and inverted T wave on LV side wall. For he had a serious chronic heart failure, he was monitored for ECG, BP, blood oxygen and advised to rest in bed. He was treated with 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> cedilanid at a total dose of 0.03 mg/kg, divided in three (one half, a quarter, followed by a quarter) to fast saturate in 24 h; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> oral furosemidum 1 mg/kg/day every day, spironolactone 1 mg/ kg/day for 4 days per week, captopril 1 mg/kg in three divided doses; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> infusion of second-generation cephalosporin and creatine phosphate sodium 1 g/day; 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> infusion speed limited to 3 ml/kg/h.

【3】On Day 21, his fever settled and mental state was improved. Investigation revealed serum ALB 33.7 g/L, while urine routine, CRP, ASO, ALT, AST, CK, CKMB, and CK-MB mass were normal. cTnI 0.29ug/L . MP-IgG 1:320. Abdominal ultrasound was normal. Chest CT showed inflammatory lesions in bilateral lung multi-lobe 删除33：<u></u>. He was treated with 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> infusion of azithromycin 10 mg/kg/day for 3 days; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> digoxin 0.005 mg/k g /day after cedilanid quickly saturated; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> digoxin adjusted to 0.01 mg/kg/day, after 3 days of azithromycin.

【5】On the second day of admission, chest CT showed bilateral lung multi-lobe inflammatory lesions ( a ). Echocardiography showed LVED dilated to 49mm ( b )</u>

【6】On day 24, his urine volume increased, and he could lie on the back. Physical examination found no changes. His mother confirmed that he had fever for more than 10 days about 6 months ago, with rashes, red conjunctiva, red lips, red hands and feet, dark urine, without hard swollen hands and feet or skin peeling around fingernails. Echo showed that the RVED was 13.5 mm, the interventricular septum thickness was 4.5 mm, the LVED was 49 mm 删除33：<u></u>, and the thickness of the left posterior wall was 4.9 mm. Mitral valve E = 1.0, A = 0.5, LVEF 30%. In LCA, there were a dilatation about 3 mm–4 mm at the opening, and an aneurysm at the middle section dilated about 18 mm in diameter 删除33：<u></u> with a 3 mm–4 mm mixed echo in it 删除33：<u></u>. Its far end was tapered to normal. LAD was normal. The middle and lower myocardium of left ventricle was unevenly thin about 1 mm–2 mm. The left ventricular apex showed diffuse aneurysm dilatation 删除33：<u></u>, and the regional myocardial centripetal motion was generally weakened and almost disappeared. Left ventricular pump function was reduced, and no additional echo was observed in left ventricular cavity. Mitral valve was incompatible, and there was a mild-moderate regurgitation. There was 3 mm–5 mm pericardial effusion. Combined with his previous medical history, he was diagnosed with KD at recovered stage, and was given oral aspirin and dipyridamole, in 3–5 mg/kg/day. He was critically ill and had a poor prognosis. We advised him to take oral warfarin thrombolytic therapy and informed his parents of his critical condition. They decided to pursue further treatment at Beijing children hospital. Then he was discharged.

【12】After discharge, he was followed up for five times. He was admitted in our pediatric cardiology ward for cough, fever, or other infection four times. He was treated with oral warfarin in Beijing children hospital, but his parents were resistant to this medication. They either reduced the dose or stopped the medication. He stayed on other medications, and he receives regular DIC monitoring in local clinic. INR was always less than 1.5.

The diameter of the pulmonary artery was 18 mm. LVEF was 31%. The anterior wall of the left ventricle, the interventricular septum, and the apical myocardium became thin. The thinner part was about 2.6 mm 删除33：<u></u>. It was extended outwards and the movement disappeared. The movement of the remaining walls was weakened. The left ventricle was significantly enlarged in spherical shape, and so was left atrial. There were no ventricular aneurysm and mural thrombosis. There was mild-moderate regurgitation at mitral valve and tricuspid valve . Pulmonary artery systolic pressure was 40 mmHg, left ventricular diastolic function decreased (restricted type) 删除33：<u></u>. LCA aneurysm dilated about 8.6 mm–20.5 mm 删除33：<u></u> and RCA 2.1 mm–3.5 mm 删除33：<u></u>.
