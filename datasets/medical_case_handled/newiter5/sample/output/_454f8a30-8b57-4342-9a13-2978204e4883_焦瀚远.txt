【0】CASE 89: FRONTAL HAIR LOSS IN A WOMAN

【1】History

【2】A 55-year-old woman presents with an 18-month history of hair thinning over her  删除换行1 frontal scalp. She denies any symptoms from her scalp and has not lost hair elsewhere.
She takes hormone replacement therapy and is otherwise well. Her brother and father  删除换行1 had both suffered with male pattern baldness in their 40s. Her mother has always had a  删除换行1 ‘good head of hair’.
Examination

【3】There is diffuse thinning of her hair over the frontal scalp extending to the vertex  删除换行1 删除33：<u></u>. The hair that is present is finer in texture and shorter than the hair over the  删除换行1 rest of her scalp. The scalp skin appears normal as are her nails.

【4】Questions

【5】• What is the diagnosis?

【6】• What are the potential treatment options?

【8】ANSWER 89

【9】This patient is suffering from androgenetic alopecia. She has noticed gradual thinning  删除换行1 of her hair, particularly over the frontal scalp and vertex. The family history of hair loss  删除换行1 in men is relevant.

【10】Androgenetic alopecia is a very common, progressive hair loss that occurs predominantly  删除换行1 in men (male pattern baldness). This occurs due to the combined effect of genetic predisposition and the action of androgens on hair follicles. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is  删除换行1 believed to shorten the anagen phase (growth phase) causing miniaturization of the hair  删除换行1 follicle which then produces finer hairs. The genetic predisposition can be inherited from  删除换行1 either parent. In men this can occur at any time after puberty as early as in late teens and  删除换行1 is present in 80 per cent by the 7th decade. In women it occurs later and the majority of  删除换行1 women will have a normal hormone profile. It is more pronounced after the menopause,  删除换行1 most commonly occurring in the 6th decade.
Androgenetic alopecia in men is usually demonstrated by a receding anterior hairline,  删除换行1 particularly in the parietal-temporal region resulting in the classical M-shape of hair loss.
Following this the vertex (crown) may become affected.
In women the pattern of hair loss is different. They commonly exhibit loss over the frontal scalp and the parietal and temporal regions are spared. If a young woman presents  删除换行1 with this pattern of hair loss then she should be examined for signs of virilization such  删除换行1 as clitoral hypertrophy, acne and hirsutism. If present, an underlying systemic endocrine  删除换行1 disease should be excluded. Testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate levels  删除换行1 should be measured.

【11】Treatment options include hairpieces such as wigs/weaves and toupées. Topical minoxidil  删除换行1 can be effective in some patients in reducing and partially restoring hair loss. Once discontinued though, the effect is lost. Finasteride, which inhibits 5--reductase (an enzyme  删除换行1 that regulates production of DHT), can slow down hair loss in men. In women who have  删除换行1 elevated adrenal androgens, anti-androgen drugs such as spironolactone, cyproterone  删除换行1 and cimetidine can be effective. Finally, there may be a role for hair transplantation in  删除换行1 some patients.

【12】 KEY POINTS

【13】• Androgenetic alopecia is a common, progressive hair loss occurring predominantly in  删除换行1 men.

【14】• Genetic predisposition and the effect of androgens on follicles leads to male pattern  删除换行1 baldness.

【15】• In women underlying systemic endocrine disease should be excluded.焦瀚远
