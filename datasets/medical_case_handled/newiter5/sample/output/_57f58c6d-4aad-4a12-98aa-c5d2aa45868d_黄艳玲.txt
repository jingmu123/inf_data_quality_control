【0】CASE 17: PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY AND CONSENT
Seven-year-old Megan is on a school trip to the Isle of Wight when she slips on the edge of  删除换行1 the swimming pool and lands awkwardly on her wrist. She is taken to the local Accident and  删除换行5 Emergency department by her teacher. X-rays reveal she has a nasty comminuted fracture  删除换行1 of her radius, and the orthopaedic team believes that it is going to need manipulation under  删除换行1 anaesthesia in order to achieve satisfactory realignment. Your surgical ST6 has asked you to  删除换行1 complete the necessary pre-theatre checklists and to complete the consent form. You try to  删除换行1 explain to him that the parents are not present, but he reassures you that the teacher can sign  删除换行1 instead since she is the accompanying adult.

【1】Questions

【2】• Who can consent to medical treatment for young children?

【3】• What happens in an emergency?

【4】ANSWER 17

【5】A person with ‘parental responsibility’ has decision-making authority regarding the child,  删除换行1 including the right to make healthcare decisions. The biological mother automatically has  删除换行1 parental responsibility. Both parents have parental responsibility if they are married, or for  删除换行1 children born after 1 December 2003 (in England and Wales), if they are named on the birth  删除换行1 certificate. It is also possible for another person to acquire parental responsibility through a  删除换行1 court order, or it may be given to a legal guardian or a local authority if they have care of the  删除换行1 child.

【6】Legally, consent is required only from one person with parental responsibility. However, it is  删除换行1 clearly good practice to involve both parents where possible, particularly if treatment is invasive or the benefits of treatment do not overwhelmingly outweigh the burdens. In situations  删除换行1 where there is disagreement between parents, a clinician may still proceed with treatment  删除换行1 if it is in the child’s best interests. However, there are a small group of decisions which  删除换行1 should not be taken by one person with parental responsibility against the wishes of another,  删除换行2 e.g. non-therapeutic male circumcision and immunisations.
Where there is disagreement between parents and clinical team, a court order should be  删除换行1 obtained before any treatment is given where there is time to do so. The European Court of  删除换行5 Human Rights in Glass v UK 通用删除7(英):<u>(2004)</u> stated that a failure to refer such cases to the court is a  删除换行1 breach of the child’s Article 8 rights.

【7】When a child presents for treatment, it is good medical practice for staff to inquire about the  删除换行1 relationship the accompanying adult has with the child. Rarely would this need to be verified  删除换行1 through other means. Adults other than parents, such as a child-minder or a teacher, cannot  删除换行1 give consent to treatment. Nevertheless the Children Act 1989 authorises a person with care  删除换行1 of a child to do ‘what is reasonable in all the circumstances of the case for the purpose of  删除换行1 safeguarding or promoting the child’s welfare’. This would mean that another adult could  删除换行1 bring a child for a routine assessment and facilitate examination for simple treatment, for  删除换行1 example, tonsillitis.

【8】In an emergency where no parent is present or contactable, urgent treatment which is in  删除换行1 the child’s best interests may be given. This is the case in the above scenario where delay to  删除换行1 examination under anaesthesia could result in long-term problems.

【9】Key Points

【10】• Only one person with parental responsibility needs to consent except in contentious or serious situations.

【11】• Any treatment can be given in an emergency if it is in the child’s best interests and  删除换行1 the person with parental responsibility is not contactable.黄艳玲
