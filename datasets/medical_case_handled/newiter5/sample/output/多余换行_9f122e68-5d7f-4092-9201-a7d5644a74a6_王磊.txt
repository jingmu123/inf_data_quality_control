【2】Introduction
------------

【3】Proteins are involved in every aspect of cellular life. Proteins function to transport materials across membranes, catalyze chemical reactions, organize DNA, support the movement of materials within a cell, and even drive movement of the entire cell. The technique of sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or SDS-PAGE is a standard technique for the analysis of the protein composition of a sample. The nature of the sample will vary depending on the specific experiment.

【4】Proteins differ in the number and type of amino acids that assemble to form a polypeptide chain. The chemistry of the amino acid side chains (R groups) determines protein folding and the overall charge of the protein. SDS-PAGE works by separating proteins based on their relative size. In order to do this, protein folding and the differences in charge of the various proteins must be eliminated. Protein gel samples are treated with the nonionic detergent, sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ). SDS coats the proteins with a net negative charge, masking any charges normally present on the protein’s surface. The sample is also treated to disrupt protein folding by the addition of chemical reagents such as dithiothreitol ( DTT ) or beta mercaptoethanol ( BME ) and heat. DTT and BME function to disrupt any disulfide bonds within the protein. The combination of SDS, DTT/BME, and heat will denature or unfold the protein.

【5】The protein sample is loaded into a well or space that is formed at the top of the polyacrylamide gel. Polyacrylamide is chemically crosslinked to form a Jello-like matrix or gel. The density of the gel can be varied based on the percent composition of polyacrylamide. High percent acrylamide (dense) gels are useful for examining small proteins while lower percent acrylamide (thin) gels are best for examining larger proteins. Gels with an acrylamide concentration of around 8–10% are standard for most research applications.

【6】The power of SDS-PAGE comes from its ability to separate a mixture of proteins into individual bands . Proteins migrate out from the well and through the polyacrylamide matrix in response to an electrical current. Recall that all the proteins in a sample have been treated with SDS and so are now negatively charged. Negatively charged proteins will migrate away from a anode and toward an cathode in an electrical circuit. The speed with which the various proteins migrate will be influenced by the degree of crosslinking of the acrylamide gel. Smaller proteins will have an easier time moving through the crosslinked matrix while larger proteins will move much more slowly. The net effect is the separation of proteins based on size, with smaller proteins at the bottom of a gel and larger proteins nearer the top. The size of a protein can be estimated by comparing the distance a protein has migrated relative to the movement of molecular weight standards . These standards are a mix of proteins of known molecular weight (in units of kilodaltons or kDa ).

【7】Protein gels must be stained to visualize the individual protein bands before they can be analyzed. Various staining protocols exist; however, one very common method is the use of a stain called Coomassie Blue . The Coomassie dye has the advantage of binding to proteins in a 1:1 ratio. This means that the staining intensity of a protein band on the gel is a measure of the concentration of that particular protein in the sample.

【8】▪ Name the amino acids that would contribute a positive charge to the surface of a protein.

【9】▪ Which amino acids are involved in the formation of a disulfide bond?

【10】▪ Conduct a search for images of a polyacrylamide gel and the apparatus used to run the gel.

【11】▪ Explain why a small protein migrates faster than a larger protein in a gel.

【12】Background
----------

【13】Red blood cells (RBCs) are specialized to carry oxygen to all parts of an organism. RBCs are unusual as they lack most of the organelles you would expect to find in a typical eukaryotic cell. These “cells” are really nothing more than a plasma membrane surrounding a cytoplasm full of the oxygen-binding protein, hemoglobin. Breaking open the RBCs (lysis) releases hemoglobin and leaves behind a pure preparation of RBC plasma membranes or RBC ghosts .

【14】Because these cells must be able to move through small capillaries, their plasma membrane is reinforced by a special collection of peripheral membrane proteins. The proteins α/β spectrin, ankryin , actin , and protein 4.1 bind to one another, forming a cage-like scaffold or membrane cytoskeleton on the cytoplasmic surface of the RBC plasma membrane. The membrane cytoskeleton is anchored to the plasma membrane through its attachment to the many Band 3 anion transporter proteins that exist as transmembrane proteins in the RBC plasma membrane.

【15】Spiders belonging to the genus Loxoceles are commonly known as brown recluse spiders. Despite their reputation, there are few fatalities linked to brown recluse spider bites ( envenomation ); however, their venom can cause serious health problems. The cutaneous form of the bite is localized to the skin and appears as a painful sore that can be followed by necrosis or the loss of tissue. If the venom is carried into the bloodstream, it can cause RBCs to lyse, resulting in the viscerocutanous or systemic form of the bite, which causes anemia, jaundice, and fever. Spider venom is a mixture of many proteins, some of which function as proteases . A protease is a type of enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of proteins based on its ability to recognize specific short amino acid sequences. This case study illustrates how the technique of SDS-PAGE was used to examine the effect of spider venom on blood cells.

【16】▪ Name the cellular components typically associated with eukaryotic cells.

【17】▪ Describe the difference between an integral and peripheral membrane protein.

【18】▪ Research/review the structure of the RBC membrane cytoskeleton. Note the interactions between the various protein components.

【19】▪ Anemia results when the number of available RBCs is too low. Predict some likely symptoms that would be associated with anemia.

【20】▪ Suggest a reason why RBCs lacking hemoglobin are called “ghosts.”

【21】▪ Proteases catalyze the reverse reaction that occurs during translation. Explain how this reaction would cause a protein to fall apart.

【22】Methods
-------

【23】### Red blood cell ghosts

【24】Blood samples were collected from four patients who had previously presented with the viscerocutaneous form of Loxoceles envenomation, four patients who had presented the cutaneous form of Loxoceles envenomation, and four individuals who had not been envenomated. RBCs were washed three times with saline at 4°C and lysed using 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 8.3) at 4°C. Membrane ghosts were washed by repeated centrifugation at 25,000 g until a colorless solution of ghosts was obtained. Membrane ghosts were stored at −70°C until use.

【25】### Venom digestion assays

【26】Loxoceles venom was obtained from spiders by electrostimulation of the fangs. 80 μg of RBC membrane ghosts were incubated with 2.5 μg crude Loxoceles venom in 50 mM phosphate buffer at 37°C for 0, 30, 60, or 120 min. Other digests used 100 μg of membrane ghosts incubated for 60 min with increasing concentrations of Loxoceles venom. Protease inhibitors, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), paramethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), or ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid (EDTA) were added to 80 μg of normal RBC ghosts in the presence of 2.5 μg Loxoceles venom and incubated for 120 min.

【27】### Protein gel electrophoresis

【28】Samples were solubilized by incubation in gel sample buffer containing 1% SDS, 10% glycerol, 80 mM DTT, and 1 mM EDTA in Tris buffer. Samples were boiled for 10 min and then applied to an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Electrophoresis was carried out at 25 V for 17 h. Gels were stained with 0.05% Coomassie Blue R250 and scanned using a densitometer.

【29】▪ Conduct a search to find the chemical composition (recipe) of physiological saline. Explain why treatment of the RBCs with 50 mM phosphate buffer would cause them to lyse.

【30】▪ What color would you see after lysis of the RBCs?

【31】▪ Why was it necessary to remove all the hemoglobin from the membrane ghost preparation?

【35】▪ Compare the pattern of protein migration in the gel shown in Figure 3.1.2 with that shown in Figure 3.1.1 . What might account for the difference?

【36】▪ Which of the protein bands in Figure 3.1.2 correspond to venom proteins? Justify your answer.

【42】▪ How do the data in Table 3.1.1 relate to the data in Figure 3.1.3 ?

【43】▪ Discuss whether the differences between values reported in Table 3.1.1 should be considered significant?

【44】▪ Is there long-term damage to the RBC membrane cytoskeleton of patients with a history of Loxoceles spider bite? Use the data in Figure 3.1.3 and Table 3.1.1 to justify your answer.

【45】▪ Which of the conditions tested in the experiment shown in Figure 3.1.4 resulted in inhibition of the degradation of Band 3?

【46】▪ Design an experiment that would determine which of the venom protein bands is responsible for the loss of Band 3.

【47】▪ The researchers conclude that the venom protein responsible for the loss of Band 3 is a metalloprotease . Conduct a search to learn more about this class of enzymes. Discuss whether the claim is supported by the data presented in this case study.

【48】▪ Predict how the loss of Band 3 might affect the RBC membrane cytoskeleton. How might these changes translate into symptoms associated with envenomation?

【49】▪ Discuss how well the experimental system used in this study matches the conditions that would exist under normal physiological conditions? What variables might be influenced by the design of these experiments?

【50】▪ What are the medical implications of this study? What would you suggest is the “next step” for research on this topic?
