【0】29.1A patient has deep partial burn wounds involving the entire anterior chest and abdomen， and circumferential burns involving both upper arms. His esti-mated weight is 75 kg. Based on the Parkland formula， how much IV fluid should he receive in the first 8 hours following his injury?

【1】2000-4000 mLLR

【2】ABC  8000-12，000 mL LR

【3】4000-6000 mL LR

【4】D.10，000-12，000mL albumin

【5】E. 4000-8000 mL albumin

【6】29.22AA 45-year-old woman suffered a thermal injury to her dominant arm 2 years ago. It took 6 months of aggressive wound care for the initial injury to heal. She presents to her physician with itching at the scar， which is irregularly bordered and has changed in shape over the past few months. Her PMD calls you to discuss the case since you cared for the patient in the ICU during her hospitalization. Which of the following is the best next step in management?

【7】A. Observe the wound as it does not appear to be infected.

【8】BPrescribe an antibiotic as it may be infected.CDE

【9】Prescribe hydrocortisone cream which the patient should apply daily.

【10】Take a tissue biopsy of the wound to rule out malignant transformation.

【11】Refer the patient to a dermatologist.

【12】ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS

【13】29.1 B. This patient has burns to the anterior chest and abdomen and both arms， so the total body surface area involvement can be estimated at 18%(abdomen and chest)+9%×2 (both arms) = 36%. Based on the Parkland formula that provides 4 mL/kgx percent BSA， the calculation would be4×75×36=10，800 mL over 24 hours. During the first 8 hours， half of the calculated volume will be given， which is approximately 5400 mL.

【14】29.2 D. Patients with chronic wounds including burn scars are at risk ofdeveloping malignance transformation in the chronic wounds. Squamous cell carcinoma has been known to develop， and a history of shape change or growth would mandate tissue biopsy.

【15】CLINICALPEARLS

【16】A burn patient is a trauma patient. Therefore， initial assessment should begin with the ABCs of trauma with assessment ofthe severity of burn wounds and other traumatic injuries.

【17】Every major organ system can be compromised following severe burns.

【18】Early intubation， mechanical ventilation， aggressive fluid resuscitation， infection control， and enteral nutrition will reduce morbidity and mortal-ity in the severely burned patient.

【19】Tissue biopsy is necessary for all changes in burn wound scars to rule out malignancy.焦瀚远
