【0】Question: 44.1 A 44-year-old woman is noted to be nervous and has heat intolerance. Her thyroid gland is diffusely enlarged, nontender, with an audible bruit. Her TSH level is very low. Which of the following is the most likely etiology?

【1】A. Lymphocytic thyroiditis

【2】B. Hashimoto thyroiditis

【3】C. Graves disease

【4】D. Multinodular toxic goiter

【5】Answer: 44.1 C. Graves disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in the United States. It often includes the thyroid gland features described, as well as the distinctive eye findings.

【6】Question: 44.2 Which of the following distinguishes hyperthyroidism from thyroid storm?

【7】A. Tachycardia to heart rate 120 bpm

【8】B. Weight loss

【9】C. Fever and delirium

【10】D. Large goiter

【11】Answer: 44.2 C. Thyroid storm is an exaggeration of hyperthyroid features with extreme tachycardia (heart rate >140 bpm), fever, and central nervous system dysfunction, such as confusion or coma. It is a medical emergency with a high mortality.

【12】Question: 44.3 A 58-year-old woman is noted to have Graves disease and has a small goiter. Which of the following is the best therapy?

【13】A. Long-term propranolol

【14】B. Lifelong oral propylthiouracil (PTU)

【15】C. Radioactive iodine ablation

【16】D. Surgical thyroidectomy
Answer: 44.3 C. Radioactive iodine is the definitive treatment for Graves disease. Surgery is indicated for obstructive symptoms or for women during pregnancy.

【17】CLINICAL PEARLS

【18】 The most common cause of thyrotoxicosis is Graves disease. No other diagnosis is likely if the patient has bilateral proptosis and a goiter.

【19】 In patients with Graves disease, thyrotoxic symptoms may be treated with antithyroid medication or by thyroid gland ablation by radioactive iodine or surgery, but the ophthalmopathy may not improve.

【20】 Graves disease may remit and relapse; in patients treated medically, one-third to half will become asymptomatic within 1-2 years.

【21】 After radioablation, most patients with Graves disease become hypothyroid and will require thyroid hormone supplementation.

【22】 Hyperfunctioning thyroid nodules (excessive thyroid hormone production, suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone, “hot” on radionuclide scan) almost never are malignant.

【23】 Most “cold” thyroid nodules are not malignant, but fine-needle aspiration should be used to evaluate the need for surgical excision.
