【0】Question: A 27-year-old man enters the emergency department in an agitated state. He complains of severe abdominal pain, but soon becomes paranoid and combative, requiring five-point restraint. His vital signs show elevated blood pressure and tachycardia. When a straight catheter is inserted, reddish urine flows into the Foley bag. The urine is negative for RBCs, and a toxicity screen result is negative. The doctor suspects a porphyria. Laboratory tests for urine porphobilinogen are positive. Which of the following enzyme deficiencies is most likely responsible for this patient’s disorder?

【1】> (A) Aminolevulinate dehydratase

【2】> (B) Aminolevulinate synthase

【3】> (C) Ferrochelatase

【4】> (D) Heme oxygenase

【5】> (E) Porphobilinogen deaminase

【6】> (F) Uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase

【7】> (G) Uroporphyrinogen III cosynthase

【8】 Answer: The correct answer is E. Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) and porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) are the two most common porphyrias seen clinically. AIP results from a defect in the enzyme porphobilinogen (PBG) deaminase, also called uroporphyrinogen (URO) I synthase. PBG deaminase is the third enzyme in the heme synthetic pathway, and its absence leads to an aberrant accumulation of aminolevulinate (ALA) and PBG. In contrast, PCT is a defect in the enzyme URO decarboxylase, the fifth step in the heme pathway, which causes an accumulation of URO but not ALA or PBG. In this case the patient presents with symptoms most consistent with AIP: neurovisceral symptoms (most commonly abdominal pain, muscle weakness, and psychiatric manifestations such as anxiety, paranoia, and depression) and high PBG levels in urine. In severe cases the PBG can cause the urine to appear the color of port wine.  
Answer A is incorrect. ALA dehydratase, the enzyme responsible for condensing ALA into PBG, is absent in ALA dehydratase porphyria. Whereas this porphyria clinically resembles AIP, deficiency of ALA dehydratase is extremely rare, making AIP a more likely diagnosis in this patient.  
Answer B is incorrect. ALA synthase deficiency is associated with X-linked sideroblastic anemia. ALA synthase is the first and rate-limiting step in heme synthesis.  
Answer C is incorrect. Ferrochelatase incorporates iron into protoheme, the last step of heme biosynthesis. Deficiency of ferrochelatase results in erythropoietic porphyria, a disorder that usually begins with marked photosensitivity in childhood.  
Answer D is incorrect. Heme oxygenase catalyzes the oxidation of heme to biliverdin.  
Answer F is incorrect. PCT is seen frequently in the clinical setting. PCT results from a deficiency in URO decarboxylase. This deficiency may be inherited or acquired, the latter due to the inactivation of URO decarboxylase by iron, alcohol, estrogens, and infection with HCV or HIV. In contrast to AIP, patients with PCT present with photosensitivity, chronic, blistering lesions on sun-exposed skin, and an absence of neuropsychiatric signs.  
Answer G is incorrect. URO III cosynthase deficiency can result in congenital erythropoietic porphyria, and is associated with hemolytic anemia and photosensitive cutaneous lesions.王磊
