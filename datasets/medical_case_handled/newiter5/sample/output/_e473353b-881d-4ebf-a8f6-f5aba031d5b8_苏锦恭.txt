Cells of the gut mucosal innate and adaptive immune system are interspersed between the cells of the mucosal epithelium and throughout the lamina propria， 删除换行5 This case was prepared by Raif Geha， MD， in collaboration with Andrew Shulman， MD， PhD，and Harland Winter MD.

【1】删除3：<u>Fig. 37.1 A variety of mucosal responses keep the gut microbiota under control. The surface of the gut epithelium is protected by both innate and adaptive immune systems. A layer of mucus produced by goblet cells and antimicrobial proteins produced by Paneth cells help protect against pathogens and also keep commensal microorganisms under control， preventing them from colonizing the epithelial surface. Antigens from food， commensal microorganisms， or pathogens that enter the mucosal lymphoid tissues through M cells can initiate adaptive immune responses， including the production of IgA antibodies. In the absence of infection， dendrtic cells presenting antigens(such as those derived from food and commensal microorganisms) to naive T cells in the mucosa tend to stimulate the production of regulatory T cells (Treg cells)， thus avoiding a damaging inflammatory response to the commensal microbiota.

The cells and organs of the gut mucosal immune system are collectively known as the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). The GALT is the largest lymphoid tissue in the human body， containing a significant portion ofthe body's2×10-2lymphocytes.

【3】Neutrophils， macrophages， and dendritic cells of the innate immune system express pattern recognition receptors and act as sensors for potentially pathogenic microorganisms in the gut. Pattern recognition receptors recognize lipids， carbo-hydrates， nucleic acids， and peptides that are common features of bacteria， viruses， fungi，and parasites.One important class of these receptors is the Toll-like receptors(TLRs)， which are located at the cell surface and in the membranes of endosomes. Activation of TLRs by microorganisms and their products triggers innate immune pathways that mediate inflammation and host defense 删除33：<u></u>. NOD pro-teins (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing proteins) comprise another class of pattern recognition receptors； these are located in the cytoplasm and bind to bacterial peptidoglycans released during infection 删除33：<u></u>.

【4】The professional antigen-presenting cells of the gut mucosa-the macrophages and dendritic cells-take up and kill bacteria via phagocytosis， and present bacte-rial antigens to， and activate， the resident naive T cells and B cells within the GALT. B cells within the bowel wall are activated to produce antigen-specific secretory dimeric IgA antibodies， which are transported into the gut lumen. Between 3 and5 g of IgA is secreted into the intestinal lumen daily， where it functions to neutral-ize pathogenic bacterial proteins required for mucosal colonization and transloca-tion and also helps prevent invasion by the gut's commensal microbiota. The GALT includes a full complement of T lymphocytes： CD4 helper T cells (THl and TH2) and CD8 cytotoxic T cells， and the more recently characterized lineages of CD4effector T cells， regulatory T cells (Treg cells)andTH17 cells. The role ofTH17 cells in autoimmunity and inflammation has generated intense research interest. In some contexts， TH17 cells may have a protective role in preventing gut inflammation and maintaining homeostasis with the bacterial flora.

【5】Given the high concentration of bacteria in the distal ileum and the colon (more than 10-2organisms per gram)， the mucosal immune system performs a remarkable 删除换行4 function in promoting the colonization of beneficial bacteria， which contribute to nutrient digestion， while mediating the destruction， clearance， and development of immunologic memory to pathogens and toxins. Dysregulation of the complex mechanisms responsible for mucosal immune function can result in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-most commonly， Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.
删除3：<u>Fig. 37.2 Epithelial cells have a crucial role in innate defense against pathogens. TLRs are present in intracellular vesicles or on the basolateral or apical surfaces of epithelial cells， where they recognize different components of invading bacteria. NOD1 and NOD2 pattern-recognition receptors are found in the cytoplasm and recognize cell-wall peptides from bacteria. Both TLRs and NODs activate the NFkB pathway 删除33：<u></u>， leading to the generation of pro-inflammatory responses by epithelial cells. These include the production of chemokines such as CXCL8，CXCL1 (GROg)， CCL1， and CCL2， which attract neutrophils and macrophages， and CCL20and B-defensin， which attract immature dendritic cells in addition to possessing antimicrobial properties. The cytokines IL-1 and IL-6 are also produced and activate macrophages and other components of the acute inflammatory response. The epithelial cells also express MIC-A and MIC-B and other stress-related nonclassical MHC molecules， which can be recognized by cells of the innate immune system. lkB， inhibitor of NFKB.</u>

【6】Dorian was a healthy 8-year-old when he developed painful swelling and redness of his right elbow. The following day， he developed mouth ulcers (aphthous ulcers) that persisted for several days. He was taken to the pediatrician， who thought that the ulcers could be due to a Coxsackie virus infection. X-rays of the elbow were done and showed no fracture or injury. Over the next 2 months， Dorian developed frequent poorly localized abdominal pain. Passing stools was particularly difficult， and his parents would often find Dorian crying in the bathroom. He had difficulties with constipation， passing three hard stools per week， but had no bloody stool or sensation of incomplete bowel evacuation.

【7】The severity of Dorian's abdominal pain， elbow swelling， and oral ulcers seemed to wax and wane over the next 2 months. Dorian developed daily low-grade fevers， at times as high as 39'C. His abdominal pain became more severe and he passed stools more frequently.Dorian was fatigued and listless and was unable to attend school. His appetite was very poor and his parents noticed that he had lost about3.5 kg over the previous 2 months. He was seen again by his pediatrician， who set up outpatient appointments to investigate Dorian’s illness. But when Dorian developed painful red lesions on his right shin and a pain in his jaw soon after this visit， his parents became concerned and brought him to the Children’s Hospital Emergency Department.

【8】The Grays were asked about the health of their family and told the staff that there was no history of inflammatory bowel disease or autoimmune illness. When exam-ined， Dorian looked ill， tired， and pale. Numerous aphthous ulcers were present in his mouth. His abdominal examination showed no focal tenderness or masses. Two inflamed anal skin tags were found and the rectal exam showed no tenderness， fis-sures， or evidence of occult blood. Several raised， red skin lesions were present on Dorian’s shins and his right elbow was swollen and warm. The skin lesions were recognized as erythema nodosum-acute nodular erythematous eruptions that typically occur on the lower extremities.

【15】Blood tests were sent to check for evidence of infection or inflammation. The white blood cell count was elevated at 14，700 ul-1 (normal 5，700-9，900 ul-)， and the platelet count was high at 759，000 ul-1 (normal 198，000-371，000 ul-1). The eryth-rocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)， an index of systemic inflammation， was elevated at 80 mm h-1 (normal 0-20 mm h-). The level of another acute-phase reactant， C-reactive protein (CRP)， was also high at 2.2 mg dl- (normal less than 0.5 mgdr). Dorian was told to return for an upper and lower endoscopy the following week.

【16】On endoscopy， Dorian's pediatric gastroenterologist found ulceration of the esopha-gus and small intestine， and a perianal fistula 删除33：<u></u>. The pathologist found neutrophilic infiltration of the esophageal and ileal lesions， active colitis with rare crypt abscesses， but no granulomatous inflammation 删除33：<u></u>. The arthritis， oral aphthous ulcers， erythema nodosum lesions on the shins， and the endoscopic find- ings were all consistent with a diagnosis of Crohn's disease， and Dorian was started on a proton pump inhibitor to treat the esophageal lesions and oral corticosteroids as an initial anti-inflammatory treatment.

【17】Over subsequent months， additional immunosuppressive agents in combination with oral steroids were tried， including 6-mercaptopurine and infusions of antibod-ies (infliximab and adalimumab) that inhibit the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-u (TNF-g). Unfortunately， Dorian’s symptoms were not completely controlled. A year after receiving his diagnosis， Dorian developed worsening fever and abdominal pain， and an abdominal mass in the right lower quadrant could be felt. He was admitted to the Children's Hospital； abdominal ultrasound and CT scans revealed a large abscess of the distal small intestine (ileum and cecum). He was treated with intravenous antibiotics and was taken to the operating room， where the ileum and cecum were resected ileocecectomy) and multiple smaller abscesses were drained. Dorian recovered well from surgery， continues to take weekly adali-mumab injections， and has been able to discontinue steroid therapy. Although the weekly injections are difficult for Dorian and his family， the abdominal， skin， and joint symptoms of his Crohn’s disease are all well controlled.

【18】Crohn's disease.

【19】Crohn's disease was first described in the medical literature by the Italian physi-cian Giovanni Battista Morgagni， who presented the case of a chronically ill young man with diarrhea in 1769. American physician Burrill Crohn and colleagues published a case series of patients with "regional ileitis" in 1932. Crohn’s disease is a disorder of mucosal immune dysregulation that is characterized by inflam-matory lesions that can involve the entire gastrointestinal tract， from mouth to anus. In 40-50% of pediatric cases， Crohn's disease involves the ileum and colon.

【20】By contrast， ulcerative colitis， typically involves only the colon and rectum. Biopsy evidence of inflammatory cell infiltrate is ‘transmural'in Crohn's disease in that it may involve the epithelium， the lamina propria， and other layers of the bowel wall删除33：<u></u>. As a result， fistulas and intra-abdominal abscesses， as in Dorian's case， are frequent complications. The presence of extra-intestinal inflammatory manifestations of IBDs， including skin (erythema nodosum， pyoderma gangreno-sum)， joints (IBD-related arthritis)， and eyes (uveitis)， underscores that IBDs are systemic inflammatory diseases. Colon cancer occurs with increased frequencyin individuals with ulcerative colitis.

【21】Breakthroughs in understanding the pathogenesis of IBDs as a result of new human genetics tools and animal disease models have focused attention on the dysregu-lation of mucosal immunity to the gut commensal microbiota and a resulting impaired mucosal barrier function 删除33：<u></u>. These recent discoveries have identified proteins that participate in innate immune recognition of bacteria， cell-ular stress-response pathways， and host-microbiota interactions as targets of new therapies for IBD patients. The finding that deficiencies in the NFKB signal pathway component NEMO 删除25：<u></u>， IL-10， the IL-10 receptor， or Treg cells result in IBD provides evidence that the innate immune system and Treg cells are essential in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Mice with genetic disruption of genes for the cytokines interleukin (IL)-2， which is essential for Treg cell function， or IL-10， an immunosuppressive cytokine， are protected from the development of intestinal inflammation only when raised in germ-free conditions， revealing an essential role for host-microbiota interactions in initiating IBD pathogenesis. Isoforms of the cytokine receptor IL-23R have been shown to confer both susceptibility to and pro-tection from Crohn's disease， indicating complex regulatory roles of Treg and TH17cells in intestinal inflammation. The cytokine IL-23 is required for TH17-cell main-tenance and survival. Th17 and Treg cells have a reciprocal relationship， because both compete for the cytokine TGF-B for their induction， which in the case ofTH17cells， but not Treg cells， also requires IL-23R.

【22】Genome-wide association studies， which mine genetic data from large popula-tions of patients and control individuals to identify variants of genes that con-fer increased disease risk， have led to new knowledge related to Crohn's disease删除33：<u></u>.Mutations in NOD2， an intracellular innate immune receptor， expressed in macrophages and epithelial cells， that binds to muramyl dipeptides from bacte rial cell walls and activates the production ofinflammatory cytokines 删除33：<u></u> results in severe ileal Crohn’s disease. Intestinal epithelial cells from individuals with a Crohn's disease-associated mutation in NOD2 have impaired secretion of antimicrobial peptides called defensins when exposed to invasive bacteria. Blau syndrome， a rare autosomal dominant condition characterized by granulomatous inflammation of the eyes， skin， and joints， has also been found to be due to muta-tions in NOD2.

【23】Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved cellular stress-response pathway that delivers intracellular organelles and cytoplasmic contents to the lysosomes for degradation. Autophagy is important for walling off and eliminating bacteria that escape into the cytosol or enter it directly. ATG16L1 and IRGM are two genes whose products are important for the formation of the autophagocytic vacuole. Identification of disease-related variants of the ATG16Ll and IRGM genes impli-cate defects in autophagy in Crohn's disease， possibly because inefficient elimina-tion of microbes from the cytosol leads to sustained cytokine secretion and Paneth cell dysfunction， resulting in intestinal inflammation. Cellular stress caused by misfolded proteins， metabolic factors， and microbes activate what is known as the unfolded protein response. This response activates the transcription factor XBP1， which regulates the expression of genes important for the proper function of the immune system. Defects in XBP1 result in IBD in mouse models， and XBP1 vari-ants have been described in patients with Crohn's disease， suggesting that abnor-malities in the cellular stress response may result in intestinal inflammation and decreased survival of Paneth cells.
