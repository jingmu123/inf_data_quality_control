【1】A 19-Year-Old Lizard with a Large Mass on Its Leg﻿

【2】Signalment

【3】A 19-year-old intact male green iguana (Iguana iguana) was presented with a large mass on its left hind leg.﻿

【4】History

【5】The iguana was initially seen by another veterinary clinic 18 months prior to presentation. There, the mass was diagnosed and treated as an abscess using surgical debridement, saline irrigation, and antibiotics. When the mass recurred, a biopsy was obtained and submitted for histopathologic examination. The iguana was referred for treatment options.

【6】Despite the large mass on his leg, the iguana exhibited normal behavior and activity at home. He had been eating, drinking, and defecating normally. Review of his care revealed excellent husbandry conditions at home. The diet consisted of a variety of fresh vegetables such as yellow squash, zucchini, apples, sweet potatoes, carrots, spinach, spring mix lettuce, peas, green beans, bok choy, and cabbage and dandelions. The lizard was housed in a habitat that provided the recommended captive environmental requirements for the species.﻿

【7】Physical Examination Findings

【8】The iguana was bright, alert, and responsive. He weighed 4.2 kg and was in good body condition. There were no other abnormalities noted aside from the mass on his left rear limb. The mass was located on the ventral aspect of his thigh and appeared to be associated with one or more of the femoral pores. It was approximately 4 cm in diameter and ulcerated 删除33：<u></u>.﻿

【9】Other Diagnostic Information

【10】Blood was drawn from the caudal vein using the lateral approach and submitted for a complete blood count (CBC) and diagnostic profile .

【11】Radiographs that were taken 3 months prior to presentation accompanied the patient 删除33：<u></u>.

【12】The mass was surgically removed on the day of admission into the veterinary hospital. Anesthetic induction was provided by intravenous propofol (10 mg/kg) and maintained using isoflurane following intubation (2.0 mm tube).

【13】During surgery, a sterile marking pen was used to determine the appropriate surgical margins that would allow tissue apposition once the mass was excised. A number 15 blade was used to incise the skin around the mass in order to make a fusiform-shaped defect. The mass was superficial to the underlying musculature and was well encapsulated. Metzenbaum scissors and electrocautery were used to excise the mass within the capsule. The one large vessel entering the proximal aspect of the mass was occluded with hemoclips and transected. Careful dissection around the mass was completed, and the mass was successfully removed within its capsule 删除33：<u></u>. Prior to placing the mass in 10% neutral buffered formalin for histology, an imprint was made from the freshly cut surface for cytodiagnosis 删除33：<u></u>. The skin was closed in two layers. The subcutaneous layer was closed using 3-0 glycomer 631 suture, with a few simple interrupted tension sutures followed by a more superficial simple continuous pattern. The skin layer was closed using 3-0 nylon suture using a horizontal mattress pattern. The lizard recovered from anesthesia and surgery without complications 删除33：<u></u>.

【18】Interpretive Discussion

【19】Results of the CBC were within normal limits. The plasma biochemistry profile revealed hypoglycemia, hypoproteinemia, hypoalbuminemia, hypophos-phatemia, hypocholesterolemia, hyponatremia, and hypochloremia. Explanation for these findings in an otherwise healthy-appearing iguana was challenging. It is possible that the published reference values used do not represent reference values that might have been obtained from the laboratory used to analyze the plasma sample. These findings may have resulted from anorexia owing to long transport associated with recent travel to the veterinary hospital. Lymphatic fluid dilution of the plasma sample would be another possible explanation; however, this was not supported by the CBC findings performed on the same blood sample. The hyperkalemia does not fit with the last two explanations, and if true, suggests either excessive intake of potassium, acidosis, or decreased urinary excretion of potassium. Repeat examination of these plasma analytes would be in order.

【24】The radiograph in Fig. 69.2 . revealed a soft-tissue mass on the left rear limb with no evidence of bone involvement.

【25】The cytology of the imprint of the mass 删除33：<u></u> revealed a highly cellular sample. There are numerous erythrocytes and nondegenerate het-erophils. The background contains a marked number of bacteria. These findings are likely associated with the ulcerative nature of the lesion. The images also reveal a highly pleomorphic population of squamous epithelial cells. The cells vary from clearly squamous cell in appearance to spindle shaped. The cells exhibit anisokaryosis, nuclear pleomorphism, multinucleation, and nuclear chromatin clumping. Some of the cells have cytoplasmic basophilia and perinuclear vacuolation. These cells are considered to be neoplastic squamous epithelial cells.

【28】Summary

【29】The iguana was discharged on the day ofsurgery and placed on meloxicam (0.5 mg/kg given orally daily for 30 days) for pain and chemotherapy in the event that the entire mass was not removed. The histology confirmed a squamous cell carcinoma. Neoplastic cells extended to within 2 mm of the inked margin of the mass, indicating that the mass was completely removed. The cytology in this case was somewhat academic because the histology of the biopsy obtained by the referring veterinarian had already identified the neoplasia. An aspirate of the mass may have revealed the same cytological findings under a different circumstance.苏锦恭
