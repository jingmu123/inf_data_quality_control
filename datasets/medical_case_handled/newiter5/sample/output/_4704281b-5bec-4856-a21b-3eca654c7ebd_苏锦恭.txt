Abstract
--------

【10】Anagen effluvium is diffuse hair loss that occurs after toxic or inflammatory insult to hair follicles during the anagen, or growth phase, of the hair cycle, disrupting bulb matrix epithelial cell mitotic activity. Most hairs (80%–90%) on the scalp at any given moment are in the anagen phase and thus, patients can experience a uniform loss of hair of this magnitude. The most common cause of anagen effluvium is classically seen in those undergoing chemotherapy, as dividing cells display high metabolic activity and thus take up the drug more rapidly, but other medications and inflammatory disorders have also been implicated. Hair loss in anagen effluvium is often reversible as the quiescent stem cells responsible for the initiation of follicular regrowth are unharmed. Removal of the offending agent or treatment of the implicated conditions often results in resolution and regrowth. The clinical picture with a thorough history and physical exam is key for diagnosis but clinicians may also rely on laboratory techniques such as microscopy and even biopsy for an anagen-to-telogen ratio. Management is centered around patient education, coping strategies, and decreasing the duration and amount of hair loss experienced. Patient education should focus on the natural course and likely reversibility of hair loss as well as daily preventative measures including grooming strategies and hair care. While these aid in the management of both psychological and emotional distress these patients may experience, it is important to assure social support and to offer counseling appropriately. With appropriate use, external devices, such as scalp cooling, which induces vasoconstriction, and scalp tourniquet application, which clamps arteries supplying the scalp, have been shown to reduce the degree of hair loss. Medical intervention, with agents such as minoxidil, which induces arterial vasodilation, may be used topically to promote hair growth but does not prevent hair loss.

【25】Discussion
----------

【26】Anagen effluvium (AE) is a form of non-cicatricial alopecia in which the affected anagen hairs are temporarily lost due to toxic or inflammatory insult 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 1 , 2 \]</u>. The toxic insults most commonly occur from medications, especially chemotherapy, but it also occurs with other inflammatory insults. As a result, AE has become synonymous with chemotherapy-induced alopecia (CIA) as other causes are rare and often not considered unless indicated by the clinical picture. AE in the context of drug-administration can be classified within drug-induced alopecia. Drug-administration and inflammatory conditions may also cause patients significant distress, so, in these scenarios, it is important to differentiate AE from telogen effluvium (TE) 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 1 \]</u>.

【27】The inflammatory or toxic insult in AE results in diffuse hair loss as 90% of hairs on a scalp are in the anagen phase. The anagen phase, or growth phase, of the hair cycle lasts between 2 and 6 years during which epithelial proliferation of the bulb matrix cells forms the hair shaft. Consequently, these cells demonstrate both high metabolic activity and pigmentation which leaves them particularly susceptible to insult 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 1 \]</u>. This insult disrupts epithelial proliferation, and impedes cellular mitosis at the bulb matrix, damaging the shaft, and ultimately resulting in hair breakage or loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 1 , 2 \]</u>. This results in rapid, diffuse hair loss, often greater than 100 hairs per day over a period of 2–4 weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 3 \]</u>. However, since the quiescent stem cells that continue to initiate follicle growth are spared, hair loss is usually completely reversible 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 1 \]</u>.

【28】AE is most commonly seen in patients receiving cytotoxic therapy. Shedding occurs in approximately 65% of patients using these therapies 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 4 , 5 \]</u>. Patients may begin to experience shedding within 14 days of administration of the offending agent and complete hair loss within 1 or 2 months of continued exposure 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 1 , 5 \]</u>. Most common medication culprits include chemotherapy agents which inhibit cellular proliferation of anagen hairs, causing apoptosis of the proximal bulb region 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 6 \]</u>. Anti-microtubules, topoisomerase inhibitors, alkylating agents, and antimetabolites have been associated with alopecia with an occurrence of 80%, 60%–100%, greater than 60%, and 10%–50% respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 2 , 4 \]</u>. Other less commonly implicated agents include isoniazid, levodopa, colchicine, cyclosporine, tamoxifen, allopurinol, bromocriptine, high-dose albendazole, and radiation therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 1 , 5 , 7 , 8 \]</u>. AE secondary to these therapies is typically a reversible process that occurs naturally 1–3 months after the removal of the offending agent; however, while CIA is thought to follow this same pattern, recent studies have linked certain classes of chemotherapy to irreversible alopecia or permanent chemotherapy-induced alopecia (PCIA) 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 9 , 10 \]</u>. One study reported an incidence of 42.3% of PCIA in patients 3 years after undergoing chemotherapy, with taxane-based agents being the most offending 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 6 \]</u>. This has also been reported with patients undergoing radiation therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 1 \]</u>.

【29】Heavy metals, such as thallium and mercury, are able to disrupt hair shaft formation by binding the sulphydryl group of keratins in the hair. Other heavy metals reported to be associated with AE include boron, and arsenic 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 3 \]</u>. Patients would demonstrate systemic symptoms associated with toxic levels of the varying heavy metals as well as elevated blood levels.

【30】Associated medical conditions include autoimmune and inflammatory disorders and severe malnutrition 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 1 , 5 \]</u>. Lymphocytes seen in alopecia areata infiltrate the hair follicle which causes the rapid progression from anagen to catagen and telogen and then back to the anagen phase. This continuous cycle changes the follicle’s morphology into a short, incompletely keratinized or pencil point hair that is sensitive to trauma and breakage 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 11 \]</u>. With pemphigus vulgaris, the autoantibodies disrupt hair growth as desmosomal proteins are expressed in the follicle epithelium 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 12 \]</u>. Recently, there have also been case reports of COVID-19 related anagen effluvium associated with an urticaria and maculopapular rash that was associated with the massive inflammatory insult related to the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 13 \]</u>.

【31】Diagnosis of AE is typically made through history and physical exam. On examination, areas of hair loss will show no signs of active inflammation or scarring such as erythema, scaling, or pigmentation seen in cicatricial alopecia, but will show diffuse hair loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 1 \]</u>. Patients retaining 10%–20% of hair in a uniform distribution is highly specific for AE, especially in the context of association with one of the previously listed medications or medical conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 4 , 5 \]</u>. Microscopy may be helpful to differentiate between conditions, such as TE, which presents with clumping, non-uniform distribution of hair loss with the onset of a significant life stressor, such as chemotherapy induction or systemic disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 5 \]</u>. Microscopically, anagen hairs have full pigmentation with roots covered with inner and outer root sheaths, whereas telogen hairs lack inner and outer root sheaths, as well as pigmentation of the proximal shaft 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 1 \]</u>. AE hairs will characteristically demonstrate a narrowing, fractured shaft as well 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 8 \]</u>. A biopsy is rarely required for diagnosis but would show a low (15%) anagen-to-telogen ratio, differentiating it from TE. Follicles would also show no signs of inflammation, dystrophy of the inner sheath, or traction, distinguishing AE from alopecia areata, androgenic alopecia, and traction alopecia 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 1 \]</u>.

【32】Treatment
---------

【33】Treatment of anagen effluvium is multifaceted, including decreasing the total quantity of hair loss, decreasing the overall duration of hair loss, increasing patient coping ability, and educating patients on the treatment course. Prior to the development of more current, promising treatments, management largely focused on patient education and the use of aesthetic devices. Patients may still choose this form of management but with the emergence of scalp cooling devices and hair growth medications, these may be utilized less often 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 14 \]</u>. Current research is largely aimed at eliminating hair loss completely but has largely been unremarkable. Recent clinical trials have shown methods that decrease but do not eliminate hair loss. Cessation of implicating medications and treatment or the resolution of implicating medical conditions has been the only method to lead to complete resolution of anagen effluvium. Reports show that regrowth is scarce and less likely to occur in patients receiving high doses of radiation therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 15 \]</u>.

【34】Patient education has been at the forefront of management for patients experiencing or may be experiencing it in the future as many patients experience emotional and psychological distress 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 1 \]</u>. It is imperative to educate patients not only on the probability of hair loss, but also on the current recommendations, course, and reversibility of it 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 5 \]</u>. Recommendations for hair care before and during treatment include avoiding physical and chemical trauma to the scalp and hair (bleach, color, perm, irons, rollers) 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 1 , 4 \]</u>. Other recommendations include scarcely washing hair and the use of a satin pillowcase. Patients should be educated on coping strategies such as keeping their hair shorter, as this helps it appear fuller, as well as considering the use of an aesthetic covering, such as a hairpiece, wig, or scarf 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 4 \]</u>. These have the added benefit of scalp protection from sun and cold exposure 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 1 , 4 \]</u>.

【35】Currently, the mainstay of treatment for medication-induced AE has been to reduce the quantity of offending agent delivered to the scalp follicles. This can be done with the application of a scalp tourniquet, clamping arteries, or inducing scalp hypothermia, causing arteriolar vasoconstriction. These techniques are especially effective for chemotherapy agents that have short half-lives and are rapidly cleared 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 4 \]</u>.

【36】Scalp cooling has been well-studied and is shown to be highly effective in significantly reducing this effect 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 5 \]</u>. Influencing factors include the type and dose of medication, as well as the degree of scalp temperature reduction. Studies have shown beneficial outcomes with temperature reduction below 22 degrees Celsius 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 16 \]</u>. Mechanically, scalp cooling would be beneficial to reduce the delivery of any systemic medication to the scalp, with most evidence shown through studies in breast-cancer patients on anthracycline therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 17 , 18 \]</u>. Therefore, the lowest efficacious dose would likely have the lowest risk of inducing AE. Studies have also looked at specific cooling systems, such as the Paxman PCS-2 (PAX). This system is most efficacious at reducing the risk of AE when used with a cold cap (CC) during therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 19 \]</u>. With the emergence and efficacy of this intervention, there is an enormous potential to ease the psychological burden of this unpleasant side effect and improve patient quality of life as some patients report treatment hesitancy and decline it in fear of hair loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 5 , 20 \]</u>. Common adverse effects include a sensation of cold, scalp discomfort, and headaches 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 4 , 19 \]</u>. Scalp cooling is contraindicated in patients with hematological malignancies due to its mechanism 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 4 \]</u>.

【37】Scalp tourniquet devices have been shown to be effective in preventing hair loss in some studies, but populations and techniques have not been uniform, needing to account for different techniques, type of chemotherapy regimen, and amount of external pressure applied 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u>. While generally tolerated, side effects include headache and varying degrees of nerve compression that can induce scalp anesthesia 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 4 , 17 \]</u>. Contraindications include any brain or scalp metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 1 , 5 \]</u>.

【38】Pharmacological intervention is largely employed to reduce the severity and duration of hair loss experienced by patients. Topical minoxidil has been shown to reduce the period of baldness by about 50 days but does not prevent alopecia 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 1 , 2 , 17 \]</u>. While minoxidil does induce local vasodilation to the scalp arteries when applied topically, the leading mechanism for which this drug stimulates hair growth include the increased activity of enzymes, such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase or sulfotransferase, but this is not fully understood 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 21 , 22 \]</u>. It has a good safety profile and tolerability with scalp pruritus being the most common side effect 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 23 \]</u>. Due to the mechanism of arterial vasodilation, its use is only recommended after the discontinuation of the implicating agent or condition 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 2 \]</u>.

【39】Numerous agents, such as small molecules, biologicals, and medications have shown promise in preliminary studies but failed larger clinical trials. These include keratinocyte growth factor, and combinations of topical dexamethasone, calcitriol, and calcipotriol or calcineurin inhibitors, interleukin-1, and calcitriol 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 1 \]</u>.

【40】Key Points

【41】   Anagen effluvium is diffuse hair loss caused by toxic or inflammatory insult to hair follicles during the anagen phase of the hair cycle.
   Toxic insult from patients undergoing treatment with chemotherapeutic agents is the most common cause of anagen effluvium, but other medications and inflammatory conditions have been implicated.
   Patient management is centered around patient education and coping strategies, as well as decreasing the duration of hair loss through mechanical and pharmacological interventions.
   Minoxidil is the mainstay of pharmacological therapy while the application of scalp cooling and tourniquets have shown benefit as external devices during chemotherapy treatment.苏锦恭
