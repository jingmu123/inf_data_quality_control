【0】Clinical Manifestations
-----------------------

【1】Diagnosis of SS is based on clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings. A proper history from the patient is critical to diagnose and define the etiology of hypopituitarism. The essential diagnostic criteria of SS are (i) history of severe postpartum hemorrhage, (ii) varying degrees of pituitary insufficiency, (iii) a partially or completely empty sella on imaging; nonessential but strongly suggestive criteria are (iv) severe hypotension or shock during index delivery, (v) postpartum amenorrhea, and (vi) failure of postpartum lactation 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 22 \]</u>.

【2】Loss of growth hormone (GH) secretion is seen in 93–100% of patients and PRL in 71–100% 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 23 \]</u>. Gonadotropin (follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH)) and thyrotropin (TSH) deficiencies occur in a significant percentage of patients followed by corticotropin (ACTH) deficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 24 , 25 \]</u>. Panhypopituitarism is very common in SS, albeit preservation of one or more hormone axes can also be seen 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 13 , 26 , 27 \]</u>. The discrepancy in degrees of pituitary dysfunction among different studies may be explained by variable times of diagnostic delay.

【3】Although the great majority of the patients with SS are diagnosed some years after the first event complicated by severe vaginal bleeding, a few patients may be diagnosed acutely just after the delivery, and it may be fatal if the patient remains undiagnosed and untreated. Acute presentation of SS is characterized by headache, loss of consciousness, visual disturbances, failure of lactation, and clinical findings of acute adrenal insufficiency, such as fatigue, nausea, and vomiting 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 27 \]</u>. In contrast to the appearance of an empty sella as a diagnostic finding on pituitary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in chronic cases, acute SS is characterized by a large intrasellar mass with superior extension and enlarged pituitary gland on MRI 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 28 \]</u>. A patient with undiagnosed SS may present with an unremitting headache in the early postpartum period. For this reason, SS should be taken into account in the differential diagnosis of headache developing in the early postpartum period, when associated with agalactia (absence of milk production) in particular 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 29 \]</u>. One of the first initial warning signs in the acute period of SS may be severe hyponatremia during the postpartum period. Hyponatremia, especially if accompanied by unexplained headache in the postpartum period, should cause suspicion for SS, and hormonal investigations should be performed 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 30 \]</u>.

【4】However, most of the patients have nonspecific symptoms, and unfortunately they are diagnosed years after delivery 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 8 , 13 , 26 \]</u>. The diagnostic delay is reported as 7–19 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 6 , 13 \]</u>. If the acute period is clinically silent, then the diagnosis can be missed later in the following period due to insidious findings. One of the reasons for the delay of diagnosis can be slow progression of damage in the pituitary over time which may eventually cause a clinically detectable hypopituitarism 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 31 \]</u>. Sometimes, intervening stress factors such as an infection or a surgery may unmask the findings of a silent adrenal insufficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 32 \]</u>. As mentioned, the high prevalence of nonspecific symptoms may lead to detect abnormalities which are not related to the pituitary such as very low vitamin D level or macrocytic anemia. Some clinical improvement of the patients after correction of these abnormalities may also delay the diagnosis of SS 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 18 \]</u>. Clinical findings of TSH and ACTH deficiencies and subtle features of GH deficiency are common, but their absence does not rule out SS since 10% of cases may be asymptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 9 , 27 \]</u>. A detailed obstetrical history including the number of births, stillbirths, miscarriages, postpartum bleeding, postpartum agalactia, and amenorrhea from all female patients may help detect almost all cases with SS. This is very commonly ignored in daily clinical practice especially if the patient is of postmenopausal age. Awareness of gynecologists about SS is also critical since some of the patients may be referred due to amenorrhea.

【5】On physical examination, sparse axillary and pubic hair, atrophy of the breast, a typical appearance of looking older than the chronological age, increased fine wrinkling around mouth and eyes, hypopigmentation, dry skin, slowing of reflexes, and bradycardia can be detected. Sometimes acute presentations of adrenal crisis or myxedema coma triggered by infection, surgery, or trauma can be seen 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 9 \]</u>.

【6】Late presentations of SS may include hyponatremia and related findings such as nausea, vomiting, cognitive changes, and sometimes death 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 23 , 27 , 33 \]</u>. In a study from Nigeria, hyponatremia was reported in 20% of the patients with SS 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 34 \]</u>. Hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia are other electrolyte abnormalities that also can be seen 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 23 \]</u>. Hypocortisolemia stimulates arginine vasopressin (AVP) secretion via corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) in addition to the resultant hypotension and decreased cardiac output 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 35 \]</u>. Inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone was clearly documented in SS patients presenting with hyponatremia 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 36 \]</u>. Hypocortisolemia and hypothyroidism decrease free water clearance independent from AVP. It has been demonstrated that GH and PRL deficiencies can also be associated with hyponatremia 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 23 \]</u>.

【7】Rarely polyuria and polydipsia due to diabetes insipidus can be seen in SS 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 13 \]</u>. Studies regarding posterior pituitary function are limited. In a study including 27 patients with SS and 16 healthy controls, posterior pituitary function was investigated by water deprivation testing and hypertonic saline infusion. None of the patients had frank diabetes insipidus while they were on adequate replacement therapy, and approximately 30% of the patients had partial diabetes insipidus. It was suggested that the thirst center might be affected by ischemic damage and the osmotic threshold for the onset of thirst is increased in SS 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 19 \]</u>. Karaca et al. from the same center confirmed these results and demonstrated that SS is characterized by subtle abnormalities in posterior pituitary functions and that GH replacement therapy has no effect on posterior pituitary functions in SS 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 37 \]</u>. It is not surprising that posterior pituitary functions may be disturbed even if mild in SS, because neurohypophysis and hypothalamic nuclei are affected in over 90% of the patients with postpartum pituitary necrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 38 , 39 \]</u>.

【8】Clinical symptoms related to hypoglycemia can also be seen as a result of ACTH, TSH, and GH deficiencies 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 40 \]</u>. Although the underlying mechanism is not clear, the patient with SS may present with psychiatric problems including delusions, hallucinations, aggressive behavior, depression and disorientation, fluctuations in cognition, and bradykinesia, and appropriate hormone replacement therapy dramatically improves these manifestations 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 41 , 42 \]</u>. Hypoglycemia, electrolyte abnormalities, and disturbed cognitive function may all play a role in these findings. Delayed recovery after general anesthesia has recently been reported in a patient with SS 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 43 \]</u>.

【9】Hematological abnormalities such as anemia (45–87%), thrombocytopenia (63–105%), pancytopenia (15%), and coagulation disorders are common in patients with SS 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 26 , 44 \]</u>. Anemia is usually normochromic normocytic, but it can also be hypochromic microcytic or rarely macrocytic 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 45 \]</u>. Secondary hypothyroidism, hypocortisolemia, and GH deficiency may affect marrow function and erythropoiesis, which are suggested to be involved in the development of anemia. Pancytopenia associated with bone marrow hypoplasia can be seen. These effects are reversible after replacement of the deficient hormones 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 44 \]</u>. Factor VIII and von Willebrand factor deficiencies, decreased prothrombin time and activated prothrombin time, and increased fibrinogen and D-dimer levels can be seen 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 15 \]</u>, although a case of SS with pancytopenia and hypercoagulopathy presenting as myxedema coma has also been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 46 \]</u>.

【10】The prevalence of osteoporosis is increased in SS when compared with those of age-matched controls 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 47 \]</u>. In a study from India including 38 patients, low bone mass (bone mineral density (BMD Z-score ≤ −1) and severely low bone mass (BMD Z-score ≤ −2) were reported as 80% and 44%, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 48 \]</u>. In an Indian study, 58% of patients with SS had osteopenia, and 37% had osteoporosis at the lumbar spine. There was a significant inverse relationship between BMD and duration of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 49 \]</u>. Chihaoui et al. found osteopenia in 41.7% and osteoporosis in 35.0% of 60 patients with SS. When compared to 60-year-age-, height-, and weight-matched control women, BMD was significantly lower in patients with SS with more common involvement of the lumbar spine. The duration of the disease and the daily dose of hydrocortisone were independently and inversely associated with BMD at the femoral neck 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 50 \]</u>. de Sa Cavalcante et al. in a case-control study, have found some morphological changes compatible with the possibly a state of reduced BMD in some part of mandibular regions by using a custom computer program in 30 patients with SS 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 51 \]</u>.

【11】A number of factors like gonadal and growth hormone deficiency and others may be involved in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis in SS. In a cross-sectional study, 83 patients with SS were reported to have significantly lower BMD, and 19 of them who were prospectively followed up showed significant improvement in BMD of the lumbar spine, in particular, after a year of estrogen replacement and calcium and vitamin D3 supplementation 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 52 \]</u>. Besides low BMD, SS is associated with lower serum calcium and ALP levels and higher phosphorus and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels when compared to healthy subjects 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 53 \]</u>.

【12】Sheehan syndrome is characterized by severe and long-standing GH deficiency (GHD). We conducted a prospective study in 14 severely GH-deficient patients with SS in order to determine the effects of GH in some clinical, biochemical, anthropometric measurements and BMD before and at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months of the GH replacement. Hormone deficiencies other than GH were appropriately replaced. GH replacement did not cause any significant changes in BMD including the lumbar spine and femur neck 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 54 \]</u>.

【13】The possible mechanisms responsible for osteoporosis seen in SS may be hypogonadism, inappropriately high dosage of corticosteroid replacement, GHD and disorders of parathyroid hormone, and calcium metabolism. But the contribution of each anterior pituitary hormone deficiency on bone loss should be clarified in further prospective studies.

【14】Diagnosis
---------

【15】The initial step for the diagnosis of SS is the measurement of basal hormone levels, and stimulation tests may be required when basal hormone levels are borderline.

【16】In most patients, baseline FSH and LH levels are inappropriately low in relation to estradiol levels, and, if performed, LH levels do not increase after stimulation by gonadotropin-releasing hormone 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 8 \]</u>. A basal morning cortisol level of <3 μg/dl or >15–18 μg/dl is compatible with insufficiency and sufficiency of the HPA axis, respectively. However dynamic testing with ACTH stimulation (not in the acute phase) and/or an insulin tolerance test (ITT) or a glucagon stimulation test (GST) can also be used, and the latter two tests also allow interrogation of the GH axis 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 55 \]</u>.

【17】Secondary hypothyroidism is characterized by normal, decreased, or slightly increased levels of TSH despite low free T4 levels. TRH stimulation testing, in general, is not required, but failed TSH responses are seen in cases of TSH deficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 56 \]</u>. In patients with low IGF-1 and at least three accompanying hormone deficiencies it can be consistent with GH deficiency. Otherwise, ITT or GST may help diagnose GH deficiency.

【18】Radiological Findings
---------------------

【19】Pituitary MRI is the preferred method of radiological imaging in SS. In the acute phase, an enlarged nonhemorrhagic pituitary gland with central infarction can be observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 57 , 58 \]</u>. The pituitary gland shrinks within several weeks, and further progressive atrophy leads to an empty sella appearance in the following years. Since most cases are diagnosed several years after delivery, patients with SS have a partially (25–30%) or completely (70–75%) empty sella on imaging studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 13 , 24 , 59 , 60 \]</u>. However, the degree of empty sella is not always correlated with the severity of hypopituitarism.

【20】SS can be difficult to differentiate from lymphocytic hypophysitis in the immediate postpartum period since both may lead to hypopituitarism and pituitary enlargement. However, the presence of diabetes insipidus, association with other autoimmune disorders, loss of corticotropic cell function first, and hyperprolactinemia are findings in favor of lymphocytic hypophysitis. History of severe postpartum hemorrhage and failure of postpartum lactation favors a diagnosis of SS 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 8 \]</u>.

【21】Management
----------

【22】The treatment of SS involves replacement of deficient pituitary hormones. Since partial hypopituitarism may show progression, pituitary function should be evaluated at regular intervals. Glucocorticoid replacement in ACTH deficiency, L-thyroxine in TSH deficiency, estrogen and progesterone in hypogonadal premenopausal patients, and GH replacement in selected GH-deficient patients are required.

【23】In acute cases where there is a high suspicion of adrenal insufficiency, glucocorticoid therapy should be initiated promptly after obtaining serum samples for cortisol determination. The adverse effects of glucocorticoid overtreatment should be regularly monitored, and the dose should be adjusted 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 8 \]</u>. The more commonly used glucocorticoid as a replacement are hydrocortisone and prednisone. Dual-release hydrocortisone (a tablet with an immediate-release coating surrounding an extended-release core) 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 61 \]</u> and a continuous subcutaneous hydrocortisone infusion pump are novel treatment options 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 62 \]</u> which may provide a more physiological replacement 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 63 \]</u>. The dose needs to be increased in cases of stress, and parenteral replacement at stress doses is required during surgery, trauma, and severe infections. It should also be kept in mind that replacement of other hormones such as thyroid hormone or GH may affect the needed glucocorticoid dose 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 63 \]</u>.

【24】L-thyroxine dose should be titrated according to free T4 levels, for example, to the upper half of the normal range if appropriate, rather than TSH 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 56 \]</u>. GH replacement may increase T4–T3 transformation and increase the need of T4 dose.

【25】In a study including patients from 19 mostly developed countries, GH deficiency has been found more severe when compared to nonfunctional pituitary adenoma patients, and GH replacement therapy was found to improve QoL, cognitive function, dyslipidemia, and body composition 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 25 , 54 , 64 \]</u>. GH replacement may also have some beneficial effects on the skin 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 65 \]</u> and sympathovagal balance 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 66 \]</u>, but not on sleep 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 67 \]</u> or BMD 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 54 \]</u>.

【26】In patients with a desire for fertility, ovulation induction can be used, but spontaneous pregnancies may rarely be seen 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 68 \]</u>.

【27】If present, diabetes insipidus can be treated with desmopressin.

【28】Conclusion
----------

【29】Sheehan syndrome is a rare and, unfortunately, underrecognized condition due to nonspecific symptoms and signs, as in other causes of hypopituitarism. However, a proper obstetrical and postpartum history of each patient will raise the suspicion and identify most. Once suspected, the diagnosis is confirmed with appropriate hormonal investigations and a pituitary MRI, with the typical appearance of an empty sella. Treatment involves replacement of deficient hormones as glucocorticoids, L-thyroxine, and if appropriate estrogen and progesterone and GH in selected patients. More rarely an acute presentation of SS may occur, and prompt diagnosis and treatment with glucocorticoids become vital. Long-term follow-up for an adequate replacement therapy and monitorization of over- or undertreatment are also critical. The awareness of the medical community about SS especially in developed countries should be taken into consideration.焦瀚远
