【0】CASE 12

A 40-year-old woman presents to her physician with a 2-month history of hoarseness and occasionalpalpitations and headaches. Her blood pressure is 170/90 mm Hg. Physical examination reveals a lumpat the base of her neck. Results of biopsy of the mass are shown in Figure 6-7. Laboratory values aresignificant for hypercalcemia. Family history is not contributory， as the patient is adopted.

Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN)type IIA， or Sipple syndrome， is characterized by medullary carcinomaof the thyroid， pheochromocytoma， and hyperparathyroidism (due to either hyperplasia or tumor).Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid is characterized by nests of cells in amyloid stroma. Figure 6-7 shows the lobular pattern of growth of this tumor. Table 6-3 presents MEN types.  |  |  |  |  |  |
| TABLE 6-3  | MEN Types  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  | TYPEI  | TYPE IIA  | TYPE IIB  |  |
| Inheritance  |  | Autosomal dominant  | Autosomal dominant  | Autosomal dominant  |  |
| Neoplasms  |  | Pancreatic islet cell tumors (Zollinger-Ellison，insulinoma， VIPoma) Parathyroid hyperplasia Pituitary adenomas  | Medullary thyroid cancerParathyroid hyperplasia Pheochromocytoma  | Medullary thyroid cancerMucosal neuroma Pheochromocytoma  |  |
| Body habitus  |  |  |  | Marfanoid  |  |

| What genetic screening tests can help confirm the diagnosis? The presence of the RET oncogene mutation in the setting of medullary carcinoma is diagnostic for MENIIA. A variant of the RET mutation is also seen in MEN IIB.  |
| --- |
| What additional laboratory tests can help confirm the diagnosis?·Elevated calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen levels due to medullary carcinoma.·Elevated parathyroid hormone and calcium levels from parathyroid hyperplasia or adenoma.●Elevated urinary levels of catecholamines and catecholamine metabolites (vanillylmandelic acid，metanephrine， and normetanephrines) in pheochromocytoma. · Elevated plasma levels of metanephrines and normetanephrines in pheochromocytoma.  |
| If this patient has the RET mutation， what is the probability that her children will develop thiscondition? MEN IIA is an autosomal dominant disease. Therefore， the probability of her children's having the mutationis 50%.  |苏锦恭
