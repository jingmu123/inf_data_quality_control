【0】For the following clinical questions， choose the descriptor (A-E) that best describes the situation：

【1】AFactitious disorderBMalingering

【2】C. Conversion disorder

【3】D. Somatic symptom disorder

【4】E.Illness anxiety disorder

【5】60.1 A 23-year-old pregnant woman complains of an inability to feel her legs. She wonders if the fetus is grabbing her spinal cord. Although she does not appear concerned about her condition， on further questioning she admits that her pregnancy was unplanned and that it has been a source of stress for her and her husband. Her neurologic examination is unremarkable except fordecreased sensation below her waist. The results of a computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging of her brain and spine are normal.

【6】60.2 A 45-year-old man complains of lower back pain and weakness in his legs after lifting heavy boxes while at work. He says that he has not been able to go to work for several days. He requests treatment and a letter excusing him from work. On examination， he is found to have significant lumbar pain without spasms. The strength in his legs is decreased because of a lack of effort. His reflexes are within normal limits. He was observed to be ambulat-ing without any problem in the waiting area prior to the appointment.

【7】60.3 A 38-year-old woman comes in for evaluation of an abscess on her thigh. Her chart documents frequent outpatient and hospital visits. She is admitted， her abscess is drained， and she is treated with antibiotics. Culture studies dem-onstrate microorganisms consistent with fecal matter， and a further physical examination reveals many old scars， presumably self-inflicted.

【8】60.4 A 50-year-old man is referred to a clinician because he has ongoing migraine headaches. His headaches are chronic and bilateral， are worse with loud noises and light， and occur without aura or vomiting. His physi-cal examination is unremarkable except that the patient does not appear to be in significant distress. When he is presented with various options for treatment， including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications， he becomes angry， demanding that acetaminophen with codeine is "the only thing that has ever helped" him. When he is told that non-narcotic medica-tions should be tried first， he accuses the provider of not believing him and storms out of the clinic.

【9】60.5 A 53-year-old man pulls a back muscle while doing his usual exercise routine6 months ago. He sought out several medical opinions with sports medicine， orthopedics， and neurology， al IL l of which assured him that he only experi- enced an unfortunate muscle strain. However， the patient currently exhib-its high levels of anxiety and ascribes any ache or pain to some unknown malady. He is so fearful of reinjury that he no longer exercises， always walks with a cane， and is insistent that someone be with him at all times in case he becomes debilitated.

【10】60.6 A healthy 25-year-old man becomes preoccupied with his health after his father has a stroke. This man monitors his blood pressure several times a day， starts an aggressive cardiovascular exercise program， and becomes a vegan. He spends 2 to 3 hours per day reading the latest research in strokes and other cardiovascular disease. He attempts to make quarterly appoint-ments with his primary care provider even though there is no apparent reason to do so.

【11】ANSWERS

【12】60.1 C. The most likely diagnosis for this woman is conversion disorder. She pres-ents with symptoms of a neurologic disorder (motor or sensory) without an obvious cause or trauma. She does not appear particularly concerned about her symptoms (la belle indifference)； however， this is not specific to conversion disorder. There is no obvious possibility of obtaining external gain (answer B). Her motivation does not seem to be assuming the sick role (answer A) but rather expressing an unconscious conflict involving her unwanted pregnancy.

【13】60.2 B. In this case， the most likely diagnosis is malingering. Although this man may indeed have some minor injury， his physical examination is remarkable only in revealing tenderness without spasms. His complaints of weakness and inability to work appear exaggerated given the lack of objective findings. The patient clearly has an obvious external motivation for embellishing his symp-toms， namely， avoiding work.

【14】60.3 A. The most likely diagnosis for this woman is factitious disorder. She pres-ents with a self-induced infection， as well as a history of frequent utilization of hospitalizations and other medical services. Her illnesses are consciously created， without a desire to obtain obvious external gain (answer B) other than assumption of the patient role.

【15】60.4 B. In this case， the most likely diagnosis is malingering. This man presents with only subjective complaints； there are no significant medical findings or apparent suffering. He is angry and defensive， and he appears to be motivated solely by a desire to obtain narcotics rather than appropriate treatment.

【16】60.5 D. In this case， the most likely diagnosis is somatic symptom disorder. This man exhibits a distressing somatic symptom that disrupts his usual life rou-tines， excessive thoughts of his physical condition， and persistent anxiety. His suffering is authentic， whether or not it is medically explained.

【17】60.6 E. This man is preoccupied with acquiring a serious illness， without any somatic symptoms. He demonstrates a high level of anxiety about his health and indulges in excessive health-related behaviors. This symptom array is consistent with the diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder.

【18】CLINICALPEARLS

【19】Consider malingering when there is an inconsistent history or presenta-tion， coupled with the possibility of obtaining an obvious external gain.

【20】Patients with factitious disorder also consciously produce symptoms， but their motivation is to assume the patient/sick role.

【21】A neutral，empathic stance with no abrupt confrontations or accusations of lying often promotes a more effective provider-patient alliance.

【22】Referral to a mental health professional can be indicated to help a malingering individual cope with the ongoing stressors promoting the deception.

【23】The presence of malingering doesn't preclude an individual from having other physical or mental illnesses.苏锦恭
