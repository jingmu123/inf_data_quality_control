【0】CASE 37: BACK PAIN AT THE GYM

【1】History

【2】A 45-year-old man presents with acute onset lower back pain after a gym session. He limps  删除换行1 into the Emergency Department several hours later and complains of weakness in his lower  删除换行1 extremities, which came on with the back pain. He also has some pain and numbness down  删除换行1 his legs and on the top of his feet, right worse than left. The pain has not been relieved  删除换行1 by ibuprofen.

【3】Examination

【4】He is unable to walk on his heels. His abdomen is soft, but he has a large palpable mass below  删除换行1 the umbilicus. A rectal exam reveals no active or passive tone.

【5】Investigations

【6】• An MRI of the lumbar spine is shown in Figure 37.1.

【7】Questions

【8】1. What is the diagnosis?

【9】2. What imaging study/studies would you obtain?

【10】3. Where would you expect to find the abnormality/abnormalities?

【11】4. What else would you do?

【13】DISCUSSION

【14】This is a case of cauda equina syndrome (CES). The signs and symptoms of lower extremity  删除换行1 weakness and pain developing acutely after heavy lifting should raise suspicion for a herniated intervertebral disc, which is the commonest cause of CES. Depending on the location  删除换行1 and degree of the herniation, a combination of nerve root and cord could be impinged. In this  删除换行1 case, the patient’s foot drop and numbness in the anterior leg and dorsum of the feet suggest  删除换行1 that the herniated disc was causing an L5 radiculopathy. The spinal cord typically terminates  删除换行1 at the L1/2 level in an adult. Caudal to this, the cord continues as the cauda equina. If the  删除换行1 spinal cord itself is compressed by a herniated disc, myelopathic signs such as hyperreflexia,  删除换行6 Hoffmann’s sign, Babinski’s sign and clonus would be expected.

【15】When the cauda equina is compressed by a very large central disc, patients can present with a  删除换行1 combination of urinary retention, bowel incontinence, loss of anal tone and saddle anaesthesia. These findings are related to the compression of the somatic and autonomic fibres from  删除换行1 nerve roots S2–4, which control the detrussor muscle of the bladder, external and internal  删除换行1 anal sphincters and perineal sensation. The caliber of the spinal canal can also be reduced by  删除换行1 osteophytes and soft tissue such as ligamentum flavum hypertrophy. In these cases, a smaller  删除换行1 degree of herniated nucleus pulposus will produce marked signs and symptoms.

【16】CES is a neurosurgical emergency. The goal is to prevent irreversible loss of bowel and bladder function and motor function of the lower extremities. While CES is primarily a clinical  删除换行1 diagnosis, further imaging will be required to aid decision-making and operative planning.
Ultimately, an MRI of the lumbar spine will help guide the neurosurgeon. In this case, the  删除换行1 large L4/5 disc is seen to compress the cauda equina at this level with loss of CSF signal surrounding the nerve roots. Sagittal and axial T2 sequence images should be inspected to make  删除换行1 this determination. Reproducible examination findings correlating with imaging findings  删除换行1 strengthens the case for CES. A rectal exam to assess passive and active rectal tone as well as  删除换行1 saddle anaesthesia is crucial; further, while urinary incontinence is erroneously thought of as  删除换行1 a classic symptom, urinary retention remains the most common deficit associated with CES.
A post-void bladder scan to assess residuals is a very helpful means of objectively diagnosing  删除换行1 urinary retention. The timing of onset and duration of each symptom are particularly important to ascertain. A foot drop developing over the last 24 hours is more likely to improve  删除换行1 with urgent decompression than bowel incontinence that has been ongoing for several weeks.
Nevertheless, surgery may still be indicated in the latter case to prevent further deterioration  删除换行1 in other aspects of the patient’s neurological examination, especially if some function is still  删除换行1 preserved.

【17】A multitude of alternative diagnoses may masquerade as CES – stroke, vascular claudication, deep venous thrombosis, muscle cramps and peripheral neuropathy. A good history  删除换行1 and examination will help differentiate these from true CES. If there is a concern for bony  删除换行1 fracture from trauma, a non-contrast CT should be performed. If an unstable fracture is  删除换行1 found on initial CT, spinal precautions should be maintained until definitive management.
The scan time is in the order of seconds to minutes and hence will be available for inspection much quicker than an MRI, which can take 30–60 minutes. The lumbar spine is often  删除换行1 scanned in isolation, but consideration should be given to extending the imaging to the thoracic and cervical spine as well as the brain in order to rule out a higher level lesion in cases  删除换行1 where clinical correlation is less than expected.

【18】While awaiting an MRI, a full blood count, electrolytes, coagulation studies and a group  删除换行1 and save should be obtained in anticipation of surgical intervention. Obtained early, any  删除换行1 pertinent abnormalities can be corrected with minimal delay in getting the patient into the  删除换行1 operating theatre.

【19】Key Points

【20】• Obtain a good history to rule out other pathology and always perform a rectal  删除换行1 exam if cauda equine syndrome is suspected.

【21】• Consider scanning the thoracic and cervical spine and/or the brain to rule out a  删除换行1 higher lesion where indicated.

【22】• Always compare with previous imaging if available.删除9：<u>http://taylorandfrancis.com137</u>苏锦恭
