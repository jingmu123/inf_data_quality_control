【0】CASE 25: FEVER AND SORE THROAT

【1】History

【2】An 18-year-old man presented to his GP complaining of a three-day history of fever, sore  删除换行1 throat and a yellow discolouration of his eyes and face. He had no significant medical  删除换行1 history and took no regular medications. There was no significant family history. He was  删除换行1 not sexually active, did not smoke and did not drink any alcohol nor use recreational  删除换行1 drugs. His friends and family were well and he had not travelled abroad for more than  删除换行1 a year.

【3】Examination

【4】This young man was febrile but appeared comfortable at rest. His cardiovascular examination and respiratory system were normal. There was a palpable mass in the right upper  删除换行1 quadrant of his abdomen and he had jaundiced sclera and skin. He had marked cervical  删除换行1 lymphadenopathy. His throat was erythematous but there was no visible exudate.

【5】Initial treatment

【6】He was prescribed an antibiotic (amoxicillin). The following day he developed a florid  删除换行1 rash. The rash is widespread, pink and maculopapular in nature.

【7】Questions

【8】• What diagnoses would you consider in this young man?

【9】• What investigations and further treatment would you consider in this case?
ANSWER 25

【10】This patient has a fever, sore throat and lymphadenopathy. His abdominal examination  删除换行1 revealed possible splenomegaly also. The most likely cause would be a viral illness; and,  删除换行1 in a young adult, infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever) caused by Epstein–Barr virus  删除换行1 (EBV). If there is doubt, other infections, such as HIV, should be excluded.
If antibiotics (such as amoxicillin and ampicillin) are given in an oropharyngeal group A  删除换行5 streptococcal infection, a florid maculopapular rash can develop. This is not an allergic  删除换行1 reaction, but the antibiotics should be stopped and the patient observed.

【11】This patient is jaundiced, so liver function tests should be requested, in addition to a full  删除换行1 blood count, renal profile and C-reactive protein (CRP: a marker of infection/inflammation). An acute hepatitis is common in infectious mononucleosis. A heterophil antibody,  删除换行1 such as the monospot test or Paul Bunnel test, can be up to 90 per cent specific and sensitive in diagnosing infectious mononucleosis. Antistreptococcal antibody titres (ASOT) can  删除换行1 also be sent to look for evidence of a streptococcal infection. If the diagnosis is in doubt,  删除换行1 consider an abdominal ultrasound scan to look at the spleen (left upper quadrant mass) 删除换行1 and the liver (jaundice), as well as a liver screen, including hepatitis serology.

【12】Usually, patients with infectious mononucleosis do not require hospital admission, as the  删除换行1 disease is self-limiting; but where there is marked jaundice and deranged liver function,  删除换行1 suggesting an acute hepatitis, a patient may need to be admitted for monitoring. Patients  删除换行1 with hepatomegaly ± splenomegaly should be advised against participating in any contact sports for 4–6 weeks.

【13】KEY POINTS

【14】• Infectious mononucleosis is a common viral disease, typically affecting young adults.

【15】• The viral disease is usually self-limiting but patients can develop a hepatitis, which will  删除换行1 need monitoring.

【16】• If infectious mononucleosis is suspected, amoxicillin and ampicillin should not be  删除换行1 given, as these can induce a maculopapular rash.焦瀚远
