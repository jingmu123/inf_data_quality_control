【19】History
-------

【20】A 30-year old African American woman presented to the office for evaluation of a 15-year history of persistent dark marks on chest with no other areas of involvement. Dark marks appeared after resolution of acne lesions on the chest and are not associated with any symptoms. Acne is still present but has abated in severity over the past 5 years, initially involving the face and back but persisting on the chest. Treatment with over the counter hydroquinone 2 % cream twice a day for 4 months has been ineffective.

【21】Physical Examination
--------------------

【22】Skin examination revealed several scattered ill-defined hyperpigmented macules and patches localized to the chest along with 3 scattered erythematous papules 删除33：<u></u>.

【25】Clinical Differential Diagnosis
-------------------------------

【26】In this particular case of scattered macules and patches involving the chest, one may consider diagnoses such as pityriasis versicolor, postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) or erythema dyschromicum perstans. The former tends to present with surface scale, while the latter may have a component of erythema and a more widespread distribution. The differential diagnosis of hyperpigmentation can be vast and depends on the clinical presentation. Preceding inflammation may be subclinical in some instances, which may further complicate diagnosis. History, morphology and distribution can help narrow down potential inciting factors.

【27】Histopathology
--------------

【28】Hyperpigmentation on histology can be epidermal, dermal or mixed, where an excess of melanin is present in both the epidermis and dermis 删除10：<u>(Ortonne and Passeron 2005 )</u>. Most cases of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation will show increased pigmentation in basal epidermal keratinocytes; however, there may also be a dermal component, showing melanophages. Clinically, brown and blue hyperpigmentation are caused by excessive amounts of melanin within the epidermis or dermis, respectively. Focal deposition of melanin is mainly seen in PIH, which can occur after a burn, laceration, acne or any inflammation inducing insult to the skin 删除10：<u>(Davis and Callender 2010 )</u>.

【29】Diagnosis
---------

【30】Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) secondary to acne vulgaris.

【31】Case Treatment
--------------

【32】As aforementioned, the patient did not note improvement with 4 months of twice a day use of over-the-counter hydroquinone 2 % cream. Hydroquinone 4 % cream twice a day to affected areas, along with daily broad spectrum sunscreen with at least sun protection factor 30 were recommended. In addition to addressing treatment of hyperpigmentation, the underlying causative condition, acne vulgaris, was also treated with benzoyl peroxide 4 % wash followed by topical clindamycin 1 % lotion every morning. Three months of this treatment regimen caused significant clinical improvement of hyperpigmentation.

【33】Discussion
----------

【34】Hyperpigmentation is an umbrella term for a group of conditions that cause dark discoloration of the skin and includes melasma, PIH and medication-induced hyperpigmentation. Hyperpigmentation most commonly affects patients with Fitzpatrick skin phototypes IV-VI who are often patients of African, Asian, Hispanic, Pacific Islander, and/or Native Hawaiian backgrounds. There is no gender or age predilection. Considering dyschromia is one of the top five skin diagnoses in African-American patients, keen knowledge of pathogenesis, diagnosis and available treatment options for hyperpigmentation is of vital importance 删除10：<u>(Alexis et al. 2007 )</u>. While considered cosmetic by some standards, dyschromias, such as PIH may have lasting psychosocial effects.

【35】Acne-induced PIH is a particularly common occurrence in patients of color 删除33：<u></u>. In a 2002 study that evaluated acne in skin of color, 65.3 % of African-American (N = 239), 52.7 % of Hispanic (N = 55), and 47.4 % of Asian (N = 19) patients acquired acne-induced PIH 删除10：<u>(Taylor et al. 2002 )</u>. Atopic dermatitis, a chronic inflammatory dermatosis, has a prevalence of 10.7 % in the US, with a significantly higher prevalence seen in both the African-American populations. A common sequela is PIH 删除10：<u>(Vachiramon et al. 2012 )</u>.

【38】The etiology of PIH has not been fully elucidated, however, it is hypothesized to involve inflammatory mediators, including prostaglandins (PGE2) and leukotrienes (LTC4 and LTD4). These mediators go on to stimulate epidermal melanocytes, causing an increase in melanin synthesis in the basal layer of the epidermis or release of melanin from labile melanocytes into the dermis. Elevation of melanin in the dermis in turn activates dermal macrophages 删除10：<u>(Desai 2014 )</u>.

【39】Treatment
---------

【40】The initial approach to treating PIH begins with identifying and treating the underlying dermatosis. Once this is achieved, the resulting hyperpigmentation may then be targeted. A crucial element in the treatment of hyperpigmentation is the use of photoprotection. Use of a broad spectrum sunscreen with a sun protection factor of 30 or higher every two hours during sun-exposure will effectively prevent the worsening of hyperpigmentation 删除10：<u>(Desai 2014 )</u>. After any possible inciting causes and photoprotection are addressed, it is then reasonable to initiate topical skin lightening agents. Such agents, alone or in combination, include: hydroquinone (HQ), mequinol, azelaic acid, kojic acid, retinoids, and soy.

【41】HQ is a potent inhibitor of melanin production by competitively inhibiting tyrosinase, the key regulatory enzyme in the conversion of amino acid tyrosine to melanin within melanocytes. By decreasing the production of melanin, HQ once or twice daily effectively lightens the skin. It is important to know that at higher concentrations (4 % or higher), HQ can pose a strong irritant effect (e.g. contact dermatitis). Any strength of hydroquinone can cause a paradoxical hypermelanosis termed exogeneous ochronosis with prolonged unmonitored use 删除10：<u>(Ortonne and Passeron 2005 )</u>. Although the exact amount of time required to cause ochronosis has not been delineated, clinical monitoring of patients using HQ and limiting refills can be preventative. Mequinol (4-hydroxyanisole) also functions as a competitive inhibitor of tyrosinase and is a less irritating derivative of HQ, which can be used as an alternative in patients who are particularly sensitive to HQ 删除10：<u>(Davis and Callender 2010 )</u>.

【42】Azelaic acid is a naturally occurring dicarboxylic acid produced by yeast, malassezia furfur that live on the skin. Dicarboxylic acid functions to inhibit tyrosinase, thereby, reducing the production of melanin. In addition, azelaic acid, 15 or 20 % is used to treat both comedonal and inflammatory acne by decreasing the bacterial load and keratin on the skin. In fact, a randomized controlled trial performed on 52 Fitzpatrick skin types IV-VI patients who presented with facial hyperpigmentation showed a visible decrease of pigment intensity after 24 weeks of treatment with 20 % azelaic acid cream 删除10：<u>(Davis and Callender 2010 )</u>. Reported adverse effects include desquamation, pruritus, transient erythema, and irritation; all of which are usually mild and resolve within a few weeks 删除10：<u>(Alexis and Blackcloud 2013 )</u>.

【43】Kojic acid, a fungal metabolite, is yet another potent inhibitor of tyrosinase that can be compounded with other lightening agents, like HQ, to increase its effectiveness at reducing hyperpigmentation. However, there is a paucity of data showing its efficacy in the treatment of PIH. Common side effects of kojic acid are contact dermatitis and increased skin sensitization, which can also lead to PIH in patients of color 删除10：<u>(Alexis and Blackcloud 2013 )</u>.

【44】Functioning as derivatives of vitamin A, topical retinoids (e.g. tretinoin) are effective alone or combined with other topicals, including HQ, to treat hyperpigmentation in patients with darker complexions. Through several biologic effects that include the interference of melanogenesis and enhancement of both keratinocyte proliferation and epidermal cell turnover, tretinoin improves acne-induced PIH in patients of color. Potential adverse effects include erythema, desquamation, dryness, pruritus, and PIH.

【45】Soy, formulated alone or with other agents like retinol, functions as an inhibitor of protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR-2) that are found on keratinocytes and mediate the transfer of melanosomes from melanocytes to the surrounding keratinocytes 删除10：<u>(Alexis and Blackcloud 2013 )</u>. As a result, the phagocytosis of melanosomes into keratinocytes is reduced, triggering a reversible skin lightening effect in patients with acne-induced PIH. Although soy products are well tolerated, there is a need for more large-scale clinical trials in patients with skin of color 删除10：<u>(Ortonne and Passeron 2005 ; Davis and Callender 2010 )</u>.

【46】Adjunctive therapy with chemexfoliation (i.e. chemical peels) may be added once first line topical therapies, like HQ, have been initiated. Chemical peels are common, nonsurgical procedures that may aid in the reversal of various dyschromias and are safe in patients of color when used properly. Chemical peels, with a peeling agent such as glycolic acid (20–70 %), are well tolerated and work superficially by penetrating the papillary dermis and inducing epidermolysis, which causes the dispersal of basal layer melanin and increases dermal collagen synthesis. In patients with darker skin, salicylic acid peels have also been shown to improve the dyschromia seen in acne-associated PIH in addition to the concomitant acne (due to its comedolytic effect). Efficacy may be achieved with applications at 2–4 week intervals, with concentrations ranging between 20 and 30 % 删除10：<u>(Grimes 1999 )</u>. In addition, pretreatment with 4 % hydroquinone may improve results. Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) is another peeling agent used for treating dyschromias, but research data to support its use in Fitzpatrick skin types IV to VI is lacking. Regardless of the acid used, it is important to treat initially with the lowest concentration to avoid irritation, which can potentially worsen PIH or lead to new areas of dyspigmentation, hypertrophic scarring, or even keloid formation. Common side effects include burning sensation, superficial desquamation, and erythema. Likewise, the use of photoprotection is essential to prevent worsening PIH after chemical peeling.
