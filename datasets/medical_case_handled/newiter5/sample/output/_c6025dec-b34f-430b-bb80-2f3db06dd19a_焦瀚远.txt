【11】Treating Scrupulosity: An Illustrative Case Study
-------------------------------------------------

【12】Scrupulosity refers to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) when obsessional fears and compulsive rituals have religious or moral content. Although sometimes referred to as an OCD subtype by itself, or grouped as a symptom dimension along with sexual and aggressive obsessions 删除10：<u>(e.g. Abramowitz et al. 2003 ; Pinto et al. 2007 )</u>, scrupulosity can actually take the form of any OCD subtype. For example, a scrupulous individual might fear contamination and engage in decontamination rituals, all with a religious theme, such as excessive cleaning after using the bathroom before prayers. Another individual might have sexual obsessions, with the fear that the thoughts are sinful or blasphemous. Yet another might obsess about accidental errors and engage in repeating or checking rituals, again with a religious fear, such as an individual who reconfesses or checks that religious ritual objects are used or aligned properly. Therefore, scrupulosity is best characterized as a category of core fear that can be associated with any OCD symptom subtype.

【13】Obsessional themes vary by culture 删除10：<u>(e.g. Okasha et al. 1994 ; Rasmussen and Tsuang 1986 )</u>, and religious symptoms are more common in more religious cultures and subcultures. In Western cultures, 10–33 % of individuals with OCD have religious symptoms 删除10：<u>(Eisen et al. 1999 ; Mataix-Cols et al. 2002 )</u>, and 5–6 % have primary scrupulosity 删除10：<u>(Foa and Kozak 1995 ; Tolin et al. 2001 )</u>. However, in some Middle Eastern countries, 40–60 % of those with OCD report religious obsessions 删除10：<u>(for a review, see Greenberg and Huppert 2010 )</u>. Similarly, members of religious subcultures with OCD are more likely to have religious symptoms than are those in the greater culture 删除10：<u>(e.g. Greenberg and Shefler 2002 )</u>. There is no evidence that religion confers a risk for OCD; rather, religious individuals with OCD are likely to experience religious symptoms. Ironically, the large majority of scrupulous individuals experience their symptoms as interfering with their religious practice or relationship with God 删除10：<u>(Siev et al. 2011 )</u>, even though those symptoms are often motivated by the desire to fulfill religious requirements or avoid sin or offending God.

【14】In some studies, the presence of religious obsessions predicts poor treatment outcome for behavioral and pharmacological treatments 删除10：<u>(e.g. Alonso et al. 2001 ; Ferrão et al. 2006 ; Mataix-Cols et al. 2002 ; Rufer et al. 2005 )</u>. In others, however, they do not 删除10：<u>(e.g. Abramowitz et al. 2003 )</u>. Nevertheless, clinicians encounter several difficulties implementing effective exposure and response prevention (ERP) with scrupulous patients. Patients may hesitate more with moral than physical risks, and moral fears are often less easily disconfirmed than are physical ones. Moreover, clergy and co-religionists may reinforce and even encourage compulsions, mistaking them for piety 删除10：<u>(Huppert and Siev 2010 )</u>. Indeed, clergy members of certain denominations and holding certain beliefs may be more likely than others to offer recommendations that are incompatible with ERP and potentially confusing to a scrupulous patient 删除10：<u>(Deacon et al. 2013 )</u>. Patients may perceive their symptoms as religious rather than psychological or psychiatric and doubt the authority of therapists in this domain 删除10：<u>(Ciarrocchi 1995 ; Greenberg and Shefler 2008 )</u>. Therapists are challenged to disentangle religious from compulsive ritual and help patients violate the latter but not the former, which often involves becoming acquainted with unfamiliar and complex religious norms and working collaboratively with clergy. Taken together, effective ERP requires skilled psychotherapy technique and creativity along with cultural sensitivity and respect of patient values.

【15】Several papers and books describe modifications of ERP for scrupulosity in general and for use with specific religious populations 删除10：<u>(e.g. Abramowitz 2001 ; Bonchek 2009 ; Bonchek and Greenberg 2009 ; Ciarrocchi 1995 ; Deacon and Nelson 2008 ; Huppert and Siev 2010 ; Huppert et al. 2007 )</u>. Many religions have existing literatures on the nature and religious response to scrupulosity, often consistent with an ERP approach. Authors of clinical treatment guides and case studies typically encourage therapists to integrate these sources into treatment or incorporate them in psychoeducation and motivational phases. For example, Ciarrocchi 通用删除7(英):<u>( 1995 )</u> describes the writings of John Bunyan and Saint Ignatius Loyola about their own scrupulosity, Greenberg and Shefler 通用删除7(英):<u>( 2008 )</u> review Ultra-Orthodox Jewish responses to scrupulosity in the rabbinic literature, and Besiroglu et al. 通用删除7(英):<u>( 2014 )</u> offer Islamic sources consistent with ERP.

【16】Although secular moral scrupulosity is not uncommon 删除10：<u>(e.g. Siev et al. 2011 )</u>, we focus this chapter on a case that illustrates the application of ERP to an individual with religious scrupulosity. In accordance with American Psychological Association (APA) ethical standards, we have altered case information sufficiently to protect the individual’s confidentiality without sacrificing the clinical utility of the case presentation.

----------

【18】### Presenting Problem

【19】David is a 42-year-old Ultra-Orthodox Jewish man, who was referred by his father for OCD treatment. David reported OCD symptoms related to prayer, ritual purity, and charitable donations. He obsessed about not fulfilling his prayer requirements by making a mistake, not enunciating the words properly, or not having proper concentration. As a result, David ritualized by repeating prayers and saying them excessively slowly. Although these concerns were triggered throughout the day (e.g. when reciting blessings over food), they were particularly prominent mornings and evenings when reciting the cardinal prayer, the Shema, the obligation for which is considered most serious and requires concentration. Moreover, when saying a prayer on behalf of a group, David often repeated the prayer to ensure that others heard every word completely and accurately.

【20】In addition, Orthodox Jewish men wear phylacteries ( tefillin, small black boxes containing biblical passages that are fastened and wrapped with leather straps) during morning prayers on the arm and head, where they are supposed to be placed precisely at the hairline and aligned between the eyes. Tefillin are mentioned in the Shema prayer, and the Talmud (Berachot 14b) alleges that one who recites the prayer without tefillin bears false witness. David obsessed about his tefillin being accidentally misaligned, causing him not to fulfill the obligation to don them and also to bear false witness with the prayer. His associated compulsions included checking the alignment of his tefillin (e.g. with a pocket mirror he brought to synagogue for this purpose) as well as repeating prayers when he adjusted them.

【21】David also obsessed about being ritually impure. Upon awakening, one is required to wash one’s hands by pouring water alternately over them (usually three times on each hand). A similar ritual is completed after touching ritually unclean surfaces (e.g. areas of the body normally covered, shoes, etc.) or using the bathroom, before one can recite prayers or passages from the Bible. David obsessed about accidentally becoming ritually impure and compulsively washed and wiped his hands before and even during prayers, and he even washed his shoes after using the bathroom. He also worried that he had not wiped himself sufficiently after using the bathroom, leading to excessive, repetitive, and time-consuming wiping. David was a full-time Talmudic student and scholar, and he was constantly involved with Bible study. Therefore, obsessional doubts about ritual purity were present throughout most of the day.

【22】In addition to physical purity, David was also concerned about spiritual purity. He obsessed that inappropriate thoughts could make his prayers ineffective or invalid. These potentially blasphemous thoughts included that maybe Christianity was the true religion or that maybe the last generation’s greatest Torah scholar was actually God. Although David believed that these thoughts were absurd and untrue, they intruded in his mind during prayers and distressed him greatly. Consequently, he avoided looking at anything that could be perceived as a cross, including the lowercase letter “t.” He would always either alter the letter or write it in capitals. In order to deal with his obsessional concerns, David would spend hours daily looking up in Jewish legal texts to check whether he was sinning, engaging in discussions with other scholars, or seeking answers from rabbis.

【23】Finally, David compulsively donated money to charity in amounts that his family could not afford. He had great difficulty refusing beggars or discarding solicitations in the mail without sending money. In the year prior to intake, David donated approximately US$9000, depleting most of their savings. At intake, his wife was aware of this, although he had hidden it from her many months. In addition, David actively solicited and collected charity on behalf of others.

【24】### Background and History

【25】David was raised in America in a traditional, conservative Ultra-Orthodox family, the oldest of six children. His father was a rabbi and teacher in a religious high school, and his mother was a homemaker. David attended single-sex religious schools, where the study of religious texts was primary, and secular studies were limited to the minimal legal requirements. Although many students eventually entered the secular workforce, David aspired from a young age to become a full-time religious scholar and legal expert. Following high school, he studied in a renowned seminary in England for 2 years, after which he moved to Israel to continue his religious studies.

【26】At age 23, David began dating. Prospective matches were arranged, and the couple went on several dates after both families agreed the match seemed suitable. David’s wife was English and from a family similar to his. They were engaged after seven dates and married 3 months later. After marrying at age 24, they remained in Israel where he continued full-time religious studies, and she worked as a teacher in a seminary for post-high-school girls. Although the specifics of this arrangement have changed somewhat over the years, at intake, David continued full-time religious studies, for which he earned a modest stipend, and his wife continued to teach at several institutions to support the family. With the exception of conflict related to OCD symptoms, they both reported satisfaction with their marriage and with this arrangement. They had eight children ranging from 1 to 15 years old.

【27】In retrospect, David reported mild OCD symptoms beginning in his early teens; however, they did not cause significant impairment at the time, and others interpreted them as righteous attempts to ensure completion of religious rituals , rather than signs of OCD rituals. The symptoms worsened in his 20s. For example, extensive and elongated prayer rituals sometimes resulted in him coming late for morning studies, and he began to experience religion as more burdensome than fulfilling. David had been in therapy twice, once focused primarily on analytic dream work and once in unspecified supportive psychotherapy. Both times he terminated within 3 months. Over the course of several years, he had sought council from several rabbis, all of whom opined that he was exceeding appropriate standards and offered reassurance. However, they did not offer specific treatment recommendations, and they often encouraged him to attempt to eliminate anxiety by avoiding situations that triggered obsessions or generally to strengthen his faith in God. For example, one rabbi suggested he avoid making blessings on behalf of others. David’s father urged him to seek ERP for OCD after his wife tearfully reported to him her husband’s excessive charity, and he observed David’s worsening prayer and ritual washing compulsions on a recent visit.

【28】### Assessment and Case Conceptualization

【29】David met criteria for OCD, but denied symptoms of all other disorders during a structured clinical interview covering most Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV-TR 删除10：<u>(American Psychiatric Association 2000 )</u> axis I disorders 删除10：<u>(Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview; Sheehan et al. 1998 )</u>. On the Yale–Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale 删除10：<u>(Y-BOCS; Goodman et al. 1989 )</u>, he initially endorsed mild symptoms and received a Y-BOCS score of 19, largely due to his lack of attempts to control his rituals and the potential anxiety he would feel not completing them. However, it became apparent in the second session that this was a clear underestimation of his actual symptoms due to David minimizing them. David’s wife was requested to attend the second session with him, and she reported that he spent hours daily seeking answers to questions, soliciting charity for others, and washing. Initially, David disagreed that this was a problem or that he took more time than he should, but upon inquiry from the therapist, David agreed that he took much more time in these activities than others around him and that it took away from his Torah studies. In addition, he acknowledged that it was a problem that he had given away his family’s savings. Although the therapist did not readminister the Y-BOCS during the second session, a score of approximately 25 probably more accurately reflected David’s pretreatment severity.

【30】David completed a battery of self-report measures including the revised Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory 删除10：<u>(OCI-R; Foa et al. 2002 )</u>, the Penn Inventory of Scrupulosity 删除10：<u>(PIOS; Abramowitz et al. 2002 )</u>, and the Beck Depression Inventory-II 删除10：<u>(BDI-II; Beck et al. 1996 )</u>. He endorsed contamination, checking, ordering/arranging, and obsessional concerns on the OCI-R, resulting in an elevated total score, as well. He reported high levels of scrupulosity on the PIOS, but suggested to the therapist that this simply indicated his religious devotion and not pathology. He scored a 3 on the BDI-II.

【31】Individuals may fear the same stimulus for many different reasons, so it is crucial to identify the patient’s idiosyncratic, core obsessional fears. For example, using the downward arrow technique 删除10：<u>(Burns 1980 )</u>, the therapist asks about the meaning or cost associated with a fear and then continues to ask about meaning and cost (e.g. “And what would be the worst thing about that?”) until the core fear is evident. David had several core obsessional fears. He was concerned about divine punishment after death, although his image was not of a fire and brimstone hell, but rather losing his share in the afterlife (“the world to come”). Moreover, the very state of living in sin and shirking the yoke of his religious obligation was itself a core fear. He had fears, as well, of intolerable and unceasing negative emotions that would result from his obsessions, were he not to ritualize, such as guilt and shame and thoughts of being a cruel person. Finally, he feared that God would cause him and his family to lose their money and sustenance were he to be stingy and withhold his resources from those in need.

【32】Overall, David’s initial depiction of his own symptoms suggested an individual struggling to understand the interaction of his own religious beliefs and practice with OCD. On the one hand, he was aware that his behavior exceeded community standards and rabbinical advice, was often motivated by anxiety, and interfered with some aspects of his life (e.g. religious and marital). On the other hand, he minimized the symptoms and downplayed the extent to which several apparently religious behaviors were in fact symptoms of OCD. This is a struggle for many scrupulous patients, who may be concerned or unclear about where sincere devotion becomes obsessional fear and where religious ritual becomes compulsion. For these reasons, the therapist incorporates cognitive work to allow the patient to examine moral and religious decision making, as well as motivational work throughout. The staple of treatment remains ERP, with a focus on learning to accept doubt and uncertainty, which always exist but are sometimes particularly difficult for patients to tolerate in religious or moral domains.焦瀚远
