【0】Case 47
A 23-year-old man is brought into the clinic by his mother. She states he has not been acting like himselfever since he received a head injury in the war. Previously a polite and easygoing individual， she says he is now ill-tempered and makes fre-quent inappropriate comments. As a result the patient has not been able to hold down a steady job and has alienated many of his friends. She says he has noticed simple tasks to be more frustrating lately but otherwise does not think he has changed since his injury.

【1】On examination， the patient has a scar over his right forehead. His neurologi-cal examination is normal with the exception of perseveration on his cerebellar function testing.

【2】What area of the brain has most likely been injured， leading to this patient’s symptoms：

【3】Why has the patient experienced personality changes?

【4】How will the patient respond when presented with a novel task?

【5】Summary： A 23-year-old posttraumatic brain injury patient presents with symptoms of disinhibition and personality change.

【6】· Region of the brain most likely injured： The frontal lobes， the site of executive cognitive function， are the most likely area to have been damaged. The frontal lobes are commonly involved in traumatic brain injury (TBI)， owing to location and size. Likewise， the sphenoid wing and orbit of the skull damage the brain when applied with force to the tissue.

【7】Most likely cause of the patient’s symptoms： The frontal lobes are responsible for executive cognitive function and are considered the source of personality and emotional control. Patients with dysexecutive syndrome have difficulty in social settings requiring intricate thought processes and intuitive nuances.

【8】When the patient is presented with a novel task： The executive system facili-tates learning， making actions and problem solving less effortful with repeti-tion. The frontal lobes also function in conceptualization of abstract problems and following through with a complex， predetermined plan. Inability to adapt to novel situations and interactions combined with a disinhibition of emo-tional control and social norms may cause patients with frontal lobe damage to become easily enraged.

【9】CLINICAL CORRELATION

【10】The symptoms exhibited by this patient suggest that he has a frontal lobe lesion. Lesions in the frontal lobes are known to cause aggressiveness in patients (ie， Phineas Gage phenomenon) and hinder the patient’s ability to carry out executive functions. These functions include behaviors such as planning multistep tasks， the capacity for quick switching to the appropriate mental mode， the ability to with-stand distractions or internal urges， anticipation， logical analysis， working memory multitasking， and decision making.

【11】APPROACH TO：Executive Function

【12】OBJECTIVES

【13】1\. Be able to define the role of the frontal lobes in higher cognitive function.

【14】2\. Understand the common symptoms associated with frontal lobe lesions and traumatic brain injury.

【15】3\. Be familiar with the mechanisms for testing executive function.

【16】DEFINITIONS

【17】PERSEVERATION： Persistent repetition of an activity， word， phrase， or move-ment without any apparent stimulus for it.

【18】COUP/CONTRECOUP： Contusions both at the site of impact (coup) and on the opposite side (contrecoup) of the brain.

【19】THURSTONE (LETTER FLUENCY， WORD GENERATION) TEST： Ask the patient to generate as many words as possible beginning with the letter F in1 minute. A normal score for a native English speaker with at least a high school education is 8 words or more.

【20】SERIAL 7S： Counting down from 100 by 7s. Tests concentration and memory. Spelling the word world backward is commonly used as a substitute for patients who cannot perform calculations of 7s.

【21】DIGIT SPAN： Also a measure of attention and concentration. A normal span is seven digits forward and five backward. An abnormal digit span is the most common neuropsychological deficit in patients with head injury.

【22】The frontal lobe is an area in the brain of mammals located at the front of each cere-bral hemisphere. The frontal lobes are positioned anterior to the parietal lobes， and the temporal lobes are located beneath and behind the frontal lobes. In the human brain， the precentral gyrus and the related cortical tissue that folds into the central sulcus comprise the primary motor cortex， which controls voluntary movements of specific body parts associated with areas of the gyrus. The frontal lobes have been found to play a part in impulse control， judgment， language production， working memory， motor function， sexual behavior， socialization， and spontaneity. The fron-tal lobes assist in planning， coordinating，controlling， and executing behavior. Peo-ple who have damaged frontal lobes may experience problems with these aspects of cognitive function， being at times impulsive， impaired in their ability to plan and execute complex sequences of actions， and perhaps persisting with one course of action or pattern of behavior when a change would be appropriate.

【23】The executive functions of the frontal lobe involve abstract thinking， rule acqui-sition， problem solving， planning， cognitive flexibility， selecting relevant sensory information， initiating behavior， monitoring behavior via judgment and impulse control， motor function， executive memory， language， sexual behavior， and decision making. It allows for adaptation to new environments and the acquisition of new skills or manners of thinking. This includes insight and error correction， enabling one to navigate dangerous or technically difficult situations. Important in social functioning， executive cognition allows for the suppression of strong habitual responses or temptations.

【24】The executive system organizes and prioritizes cognitive resources in such a way as to allow for complex conceptualization of abstract problems and execution of detailed plans and actions. It is required for foresight or temporal planning， crit-ical analysis of rules， limitations and abilities， focus for attainment of goals， and 删除换行1 reflection for troubleshooting and adaptation. For previously encountered situa-tions， a patient with dysexecutive syndrome can rely on learned， automatic physical and psychological responses. In novel situations， however， the patient does not have these automatic responses to fall back on or the abilities to organize his thoughts in order to deal with the new circumstances. Patients are unable to reach a particular goal secondary to the fact that they cannot plan and execute the smaller individual steps to achieve the desired end. The end result is thatthe patient is seen as apa-thetic and easily distractible. This can also be frustrating for a patient， which may lead to outbursts of anger.

【25】Damage to the frontal lobes may occur through traumatic injury， mass lesions， cerebrovascular and degenerative disease， or infection. For example， the frontal lobes are affected by normal aging， and by pathological degenerative processes， such as multiple sclerosis， Huntington’s disease， and AD. Cerebrovascular disease， such as the occlusion or hemorrhage of the anterior communicating artery， also may lead to damage of the frontal lobes. The dominant neurotransmitter in the frontal lobe is dopamine. Low levels of dopamine often present as problems in frontal lobe func-tioning， one example of such being schizophrenia.

【26】The most commonly cited example of a dysexecutive patient is that of Phineas Gage. Mr Gage sustained injury to his prefrontal cortex (PFC) following a railroad construction accident in 1848， when a 1.1-m， 6-kg tamping iron went in under his left cheek bone and out through the top of his head. Mr Gage went from being an efficient foreman to an impulsive， profane individual with an inability to plan and carry out productive goals. While intelligence is intact， patients with frontal lobe damage show difficulty with emotional control， social interaction， and memory. This disinhibition is attributed to a disconnection between the PFC and the auto-nomic nervous system. Without a“warning" to alert the individual to a dangerous， undesirable， or sensitive situation， executive decision making is severely hampered. As such， executive cognition may not act so much to inform us of what behaviors are appropriate but more to deter us from inappropriate interactions. The difficulty interpreting environmental stimuli contributes to the previously described social dysfunction and impaired learning (feedback to guide behavior).

【27】The impulse-control difficulties leading to social dysfunction also may manifest as utilization behavior. For example， without instruction or reason， patients may be compelled to use daily objects within their visual field. For example， if a patient were to see a toothbrush in front of him， he would begin to brush his teeth， and do so repeatedly， even if he had already brushed his teeth. When asked why they are using this object without purpose， patients tend to confabulate. Patients may also perseverate in speech and action.

【28】Spontaneity appears to originate in the frontal lobes as well. Patients with frontal lobe damage have limited facial expression and can have either increased spontaneity of speech (right frontal in a right-handed individual) or decreased (left frontal). Patients may also have deficits of declarative memory or memory for tem-poral order of events. Working memory and attention are frequently impaired. This is in contrast to the declarative memory deficits found with hippocampal damage.焦瀚远
