【0】Question: 6.1 A 24-year-old woman was hospitalized for acute pelvic inflammatory disease, and was treated with intravenous cefoxitin and clindamycin. Three days after discharge from the hospital, she developed severe abdominal pain and diarrhea. Which of the following organisms is the most likely causative agent?

【1】A. Bacillus anthracis

【2】B. Bacillus cereus

【3】C. Clostridium botulinum

【4】D. Clostridium difficile

【5】E. Clostridium tetani

【6】Answer: 6.1 D. The use of broad-spectrum antibiotics such as ampicillin and clindamycin has been associated with pseudomembranous colitis. Antibiotic administration results in the proliferation of drug-resistant C. difficile that produces toxins A (a potent enterotoxin with cytotoxic activity) and B (a potent cytotoxin). This disease is most appropriately treated by discontinuing the offending antibiotic and instead administering oral doses of either metronidazole or vancomycin. The administration of antibiotics may also lead to a milder form of diarrhea, called antibiotic-associated diarrhea. This form is associated with C. difficile approximately 25% of the time.

【7】Question: 6.2 Which laboratory test is the best method to confirm the diagnosis of the patient in Question 6.1?

【8】A. Gas/liquid chromatography

【9】B. Pseudomembranous visualization

【10】C. Rapid fatty acid detection assays

【11】D. Tissue culture toxin detection assay

【12】Answer: 6.2 D. All of the above tests may be used as detection assays for C. difficile . However, only the tissue culture toxin detection assay is the gold standard laboratory test. This test involves a specific toxin-neutralizing antibody that detects toxin (toxins A and B) production in the stool using a tissue culture detection assay. Not all C. difficile strains produce toxins, and the toxin genes are not carried on plasmids or phages.

【13】Question: 6.3 A hospitalized patient developed severe diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis within 5 days after antibiotic therapy was initiated. The severe diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis occurred as a result of which of the following?

【14】A. Collagenase

【15】B. Fibrinolysin

【16】C. Hyaluronidase

【17】D. Lecithinase

【18】E. Mucinase

【19】F. Toxins A and B
Answer: 6.3 F. Clostridium difficile produces 2 toxins, toxins A and B. Both toxins are present in stool samples. Toxin A is enterotoxic causing the severe diarrhea, whereas toxin B is cytotoxic leading to the destruction of enterocytes, resulting in pseudomembranous colitis. For additional information please refer to the discussions for questions 6.1 and 6.2.

【20】MICROBIOLOGY PEARLS

【21】 The most common cause of diarrhea in a patient who has been hospitalized for 3 or more days is C. difficile .

【22】 The initial treatment for pseudomembranous colitis is metronidazole. Oral vancomycin is used for those who fail to respond to metronidazole.

【23】 Detection of toxins in the stool is the method of choice for diagnosis of C. difficile colitis.焦瀚远
