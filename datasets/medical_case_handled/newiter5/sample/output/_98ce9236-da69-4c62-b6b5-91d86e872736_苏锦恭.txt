【0】Question: A 68-year-old man with a six-month history of back pain and fatigue presents to the emergency department because of severe low back pain. MRI shows multiple lytic bone lesions scattered throughout the man’s body, and laboratory results show a serum M spike and light chain proteinuria. Bone marrow biopsy demonstrates an excessive number of the cells shown in the image. Which of the following is most likely to be present in these cells?

> (A) Abundant mitochondria

【1】> (B) Abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum

【2】> (C) Abundant secondary lysosomes

【3】> (D) Abundant smooth endoplasmic reticulum
 Answer: The correct answer is B . This patient has multiple myeloma, a neoplastic proliferation of plasma cells in the bone marrow that often leads to lytic bone lesions and pathological fractures. The plasma cell is a differentiated B lymphocyte that can produce and secrete large amounts of antibody specific to a particular antigen. Rough endoplasmic reticulum is the site of synthesis of secretory proteins; thus antibody-secreting plasma cells are rich in RER. Normally there is a polyclonal distribution of immunoglobulins of different isotypes and antigen specificities in the serum. In multiple myeloma, however, the majority of plasma cells are producing immunoglobulin of one isotype and antigen specifically, which can be detected as an M spike by serum protein electrophoresis. The free light chains (either kappa or lambda) can often be detected in the urine; this is referred to as Bence-Jones proteinuria. Patients with multiple myeloma might also manifest anemia, increased susceptibility to infection, or clotting abnormalities secondary to the reduced production of normal blood components.  
Answer A is incorrect . The primary function of mitochondria is the synthesis of ATP. They are abundant in cells that require a large amount of energy, such as myocytes.  
Answer C is incorrect . Secondary lysosomes are formed when a primary lysosome, with its hydrolytic enzymes, fuses with materials for degradation. Secondary lysosomes have substrates at different stages of digestion. Cells such as macrophages, which are responsible for phagocytosis of cell debris, may contain multiple secondary lysosomes.  
Answer D is incorrect . Smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) is the site of steroid synthesis and detoxification of drugs and poisons; thus, cells like hepatocytes and steroid-producing cells of the adrenal cortex are rich in SER.  
Answer E is incorrect . Areas of rough endoplasmic reticulum in neurons are called Nissl bodies. This is the site of enzyme and peptide neurotransmitter synthesis.苏锦恭
