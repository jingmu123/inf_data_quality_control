【0】CASE 85: SOILING BEHIND SOFA

【1】History

【2】An 11-year-old boy is presented with soiling in different places throughout the house, for  删除换行1 example, in the living room behind the sofa. He has been doing this for some years but the  删除换行1 situation has recently worsened. He also wets at night and urinates in inappropriate places.
He does not appear to be wet during the day.

【3】The boy is currently in temporary foster care while his future care is planned. He was  删除换行1 removed from his mother’s care because there was some concern over whether she could  删除换行1 meet his emotional needs after several episodes of emotional abuse and neglect. She herself  删除换行1 has a moderate learning disability.

【4】The mother had an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery with the boy. However, when he  删除换行1 was only a few days old his father left. His mother has always struggled to care for him. His  删除换行1 development was initially delayed but he had a spell in care during which he made rapid  删除换行1 gains. However, as his mother was said to have benefited from some parenting work he was  删除换行1 returned to her care. His supervision by her has been very variable and he has often had to  删除换行1 fend for himself. Attendance at school has been variable, but when at school he has shown a  删除换行1 mistrust of adults and a tendency to be aggressive with his peers.

【5】Mental state examination and physical examination

【6】He is a wary boy who makes fleeting eye contact but then looks away. He does not willingly  删除换行1 engage in questions related to the soiling but will answer questions about more general issues.
He is somewhat small for his age.

【7】Physical examination shows he has a small abdominal mass, and rectal examination and  删除换行1 abdominal X-ray show that he is constipated.

【8】Question

【9】• How would you manage this situation?

【10】ANSWER 85

【11】Differential diagnosis would include constipation and anal fissure causing retention and  删除换行1 leading to a vicious cycle of bowel loading and dysfunction. However, the deliberate soiling  删除换行1 and the history suggest emotional and behavioural disturbance. Attachment problems are  删除换行1 likely given the history of current neglect and history of abuse. It is possible that the extent of  删除换行1 abuse is more than has been discovered. Rare physical causes like short-loop Hirschsprung  删除换行1 disease, if considered, would require referral to a paediatrician. This would be sensible if constipation is ongoing. The smearing is not likely to be organic, but physical and psychological  删除换行1 causes can coexist. In many respects the behaviour represents maladaptive coping strategies.

【12】Encopresis (involuntary soiling) is more likely to occur in boys than girls. It tends to improve  删除换行1 with age and is relatively uncommon after age 16. Most children with encopresis have learnt  删除换行1 to control their bowels, but for various reasons lose this ability and develop secondary  删除换行1 encopresis.

【13】Management will usually begin with treatment of any constipation and reinstatement of an  删除换行1 effective training strategy with support for the carers. Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) 删除换行1 and contingency strategies are useful. However, any underlying psychiatric disorder will  删除换行1 need to be treated or managed (such as counselling for past abuse) although this can be more  删除换行1 difficult the older the child is. It is also important to be aware that encopresis may lead to  删除换行1 scapegoating, anxiety and low self-esteem. Addressing these will also need to be part of the  删除换行1 overall management strategy. The initial treatment can begin immediately and supporting  删除换行1 treatments can be undertaken simultaneously. Child protection issues need to be reviewed,  删除换行1 particularly as these behaviours may represent a ‘flag’ for emotional or family disturbance  删除换行1 that needs to be addressed.

【14】Key Points

【15】• Faecal smearing should alert professionals that there may be child protection  删除换行1 issues to consider.

【16】• Treatment of the constipation will not be sufficient.

【17】Medical causes for faecal soiling

【18】These include functional constipation and faecal retention, anorectal lesions that make  删除换行1 defecation painful, neurological causes, bowel disease, endocrine or metabolic causes.
