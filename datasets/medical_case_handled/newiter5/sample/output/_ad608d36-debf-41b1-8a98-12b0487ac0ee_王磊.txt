【0】CASE 45: A FALL ON THE HAND AND PAIN IN THE WRIST

【1】History

【2】A 20-year-old man attends the accident and emergency department following a fall onto  删除换行1 his flexed left wrist while playing football.

【3】Examination

【4】He demonstrates a markedly reduced range of movement and is complaining of point  删除换行1 tenderness on the dorsum and ulnar aspect of the left wrist. There is no pain on palpation  删除换行1 of the anatomical snuffbox or upon axial loading of the thumb. Radiographs are taken  删除换行1 删除33：<u></u>.

【5】Questions

【6】• What injury do you suspect he may have sustained?

【7】• What do the wrist radiographs demonstrate?

 ANSWER 45

【10】Triquetral fractures typically occur from a hyperextension injury with the wrist in ulnar  删除换行1 deviation, however, can also occur with hyperflexion. Either the dorsal or volar radiotriquetral ligaments may avulse triquetral fragments at their attachments. Behind fractures of the scaphoid, triquetral fractures are the second most common carpal bone to  删除换行1 fracture. They are frequently seen as dorsal chip fractures only on the lateral projection  删除换行1 删除33：<u></u> since the pisiform usually overlies the triquetrum on the frontal projection  删除换行1 of the wrist 删除33：<u></u>. In this case there is a small avulsion from the dorsum of the  删除换行1 triquetrum seen only on the lateral projection 删除33：<u>通用删除1(英):<u>(arrow, Figure 45.3)</u></u>.

【12】Patients will usually complain of localized tenderness on the dorsum of the wrist.

【13】The triquetrum may be identified by its pyramidal shape and by an oval isolated facet for  删除换行1 articulation with the pisiform bone. It is situated just distal to the ulna and the triangular  删除换行1 fibrocartilage complex, proximal to the base of the hamate.

【14】The superior surface presents a medial, rough, non-articular portion, and a lateral convex  删除换行1 articular portion, which articulates with the triangular articular disc of the wrist. The inferior surface, directed laterally, is concave, sinuously curved and smooth for articulation  删除换行1 with the hamate. The dorsal surface is rough for the attachment of ligaments. The triquetrum articulates on its radial side with the lunate to which it is attached by the lunotriquetral ligament. On the volar (palmar) aspect there is an articulation with the pisiform.

【15】Triquetral fractures may divided into two types:

【16】• Chip fractures: A chip fracture, usually off the dorsal radial surface, typically occurs  删除换行1 with a wrist hyperextension injury. Chip fractures can also occur with the hyperflexion.

【17】• Mid-body fracture: Fractures through the mid-body of the triquetrum are less frequent than a chip fracture. This type of fracture is usually due to a direct blow, or  删除换行1 may occur in conjunction with a perilunate dislocation. The dislocation may have  删除换行1 been reduced, so a triquetral fracture from the proximal radial aspect of the bone may  删除换行1 indicate the presence of a former dislocation.

【18】 KEY POINTS

【19】• Triquetral fractures are the second most common fracture of the carpal bones.

【20】• They are frequently seen as dorsal chip fractures only on the lateral projection as the  删除换行1 pisiform usually overlies the triquetrum on the AP projection of the wrist.王磊
