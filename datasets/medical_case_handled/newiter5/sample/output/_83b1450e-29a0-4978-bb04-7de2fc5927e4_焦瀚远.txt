【0】Case 70: Leg Weakness

【1】History

【2】A 24-year-old woman was attending her regular Sunday church service. During the singing  删除换行1 of a hymn she suddenly fell to the ground without any loss of consciousness and told the  删除换行1 other members of the congregation who rushed to her aid that she had complete paralysis of her left leg. She was unable to stand and was taken by ambulance to the emergency  删除换行1 department. She has no other neurological symptoms and is otherwise healthy. She has  删除换行1 no relevant past or family history, is on no medication, and has never smoked or drunk  删除换行1 alcohol. She works as a sales assistant in a bookshop and until recently lived in a flat with  删除换行1 a partner of 3 years’ standing until they split up 4 weeks previously. She has moved back in  删除换行1 with her parents.

【3】Examination
She looks well and is in no distress, making light of her condition with the staff. The only  删除换行1 abnormalities are in the nervous system. She is completely oriented and the Mini-Mental  删除换行5 State score is normal. The cranial nerves and the neurology of the upper limbs and right leg  删除换行1 are normal. The left leg is completely still during the examination, and the patient is unable to  删除换行1 move it on request. Tone is normal; coordination could not be tested because of the paralysis.
Superficial sensation was completely absent below the margin of the left buttock and the left  删除换行1 groin, with a clear transition to normal above this circumference at the top of the left leg.
Vibration and joint position sense were completely absent in the left leg. There was normal  删除换行1 withdrawal of the leg to nociceptive stimuli such as firm stroking of the sole and increasing  删除换行1 compression of the Achilles’ tendon. The superficial reflexes and tendon reflexes were normal, and the plantar response was flexor.

【4】Questions

【5】•	 What is the diagnosis?

【6】•	 How would you manage this case?

【7】ANSWER 70

【8】This patient has hysteria, now renamed dissociative disorder. The clues to this are the cluster of

【9】•	 the bizarre complex of neurological symptoms and signs that do not fit neuroanatomical principles (e.g. the reflex responses and withdrawal to stimuli despite the paralysis)

【10】•	 the patient’s lack of concern, known by the French term of la belle indifference

【11】•	 the onset in relation to stress (i.e. the loss of her partner)

【12】•	 secondary gain: removing herself from the parental home, which is a painful  删除换行1 reminder of her splitting from her partner

【13】None of these on its own is specific for the diagnosis, but put together they are typical. In any  删除换行1 case of dissociative disorder, the diagnosis is one of exclusion; in this case the neurological  删除换行1 examination excludes organic lesions. It is important to realize that this disorder is distinct  删除换行1 from malingering and factitious disease. The condition is real to patients, and they must not  删除换行1 be told that they are faking illness or wasting the time of staff.

【14】The management is to explain the dissociation—in this case it is between her will to move  删除换行1 her leg and its failure to respond—as being due to stress, and that there is no underlying  删除换行1 serious disease such as multiple sclerosis. A very positive attitude that she will recover is  删除换行1 essential, and it is important to reinforce this with appropriate physical treatment, in this  删除换行1 case physiotherapy.

【15】The prognosis in cases of recent onset is good, and this patient made a complete recovery in  删除换行1 8 days.

【16】Dissociative disorder frequently presents with neurological symptoms, and the commonest  删除换行1 of these are convulsions, blindness, pain and amnesia. Clearly some of these will require full  删除换行1 neurological investigation to exclude organic disease.

【17】KEY POINTS

【18】•	 Dissociative disorder frequently presents as a neurological illness.

【19】•	 The diagnosis of dissociative disorder must be one of exclusion.焦瀚远
