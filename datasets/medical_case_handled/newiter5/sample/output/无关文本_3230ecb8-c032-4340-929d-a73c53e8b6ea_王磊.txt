【0】Case 1.1 Soft tissue infection following traumatic aquatic exposure

【1】In early September 2010， a 7-year-old boy suffered a laceration injury to the left calf during a recreational boat ride on a coastal river. He was brought to the emergency room (ER) within 2 hours of this accident， after initial cleansing first aid with saline in the field.

【2】The wound was noted to be severe and deep， and was described as "partial degloving" by the ER physician. The boy’s vital signs were stable. Due to the nature of the wound， an orthopedic surgeon was consulted and the patient was taken to surgery within 2 hours for wound washout and closure. X-rays of the leg showed no fractures.

【3】Cefazolin and gentamicin were given preoperatively. The patient received 34stitches to close the large (>10 cm) complex left calf laceration injury after exten-sive washout. No cultures were done.

【4】One day later， infectious diseases consult was sought for outpatient oral antibiotic recommendations， in anticipation of discharge home later that day.

【5】The boy's past medical history was unremarkable， except for hospital admis-sion for symptoms of nausea and vomiting 1 year earlier， and ear tubes placed1.5 years earlier.

【6】His examination was unremarkable except for superficial abrasions on the lower abdomen and right upper arm， and the deep (now sutured) left calf lacer-ation. Temperature was 100.5°F， but other vital signs were stable.

【7】A combination of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and cefuroxime was rec-ommended as oral antibiotics， and the patient was then discharged to outpatient follow-up.

【8】Six days after discharge from the hospital， he was readmitted because of wound infection. He had failed to take the prescribed antibiotics because of severe nausea.

【9】At surgery， no frank pus was found but serous old blood and drainage were noted. A swab of this drainage was stained and cultured.

【12】The infectious diseases consultant was called (after surgery) to help with additional recommendations. He added ceftriaxone to the vancomycin already prescribed.Examination of the patient the next day found him to be comfortable， afebrile， and eating breakfast. His temperature was normal (97.8°F). The abdom-inal skin abrasions were healing， but the left calf was wrapped up following the surgical incision and debridement (I8D) the day before.

【13】Basic laboratory findings were normal (white blood cell \[WBC\] count was7300/uL， platelet count 401，000/pL， and creatinine 0.5 mg/dL).

【14】The gram stain of the serous fluid from the wound showed rare WBCs and no organisms. Twenty-four hours later， the culture was reported positive for a gram-negative rod (GNR).

【16】· What are the likely organisms in this patient (differential diagnoses) and why?

It was noted later to be resistant to penicillin/ampicillin-like agents， including carbapenems， but sensitive to second- and third-generation cephalosporins， quinolones， and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole， as well as tetracyclines and aminoglycosides.

【22】The patient was discharged 6 days later to outpatient follow-up on intra-venous ceftriaxone after a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC line) was placed.

【23】Two months later he was doing very well， and underwent plastic surgical repair of the calf laceration 删除33：<u></u>.

【24】·What were the clues to the diagnosis?

【25】Case discussion

【26】First， the injury occurred while boating on a river， in possibly brackish water(coastal river). Gram-negative organisms are common and likely to contaminate the wound with such a severe laceration injury. The organism grew rapidly on all three culture media used (BA， Choc BA， and MAC). It was oxidase positive， non-lactose fermenting， mucoid， and beta-hemolytic on sheep BA. It did not require high salt concentration to grow， making certain Vibrio organisms (those that need high， 6.5% salt concentration) unlikely. The sensitivity pattern is also useful . The organism turned out to be sensitive to the two agents originally recommended (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and cefuroxime). The child was unable to take the antibiotics because of persistent nausea.

【27】Differential diagnosis

【28】Our differential diagnoses at the onset were Aeromonas or Pleisiomonas， more likely than Vibrio， because of the fresh water or brackish water environment where the injury occurred. The luxuriant growth in all three media was in keep-ing with the differential diagnoses chosen.

【29】·Final diagnosis： Aeromonas hydrophila

【30】Some data from the literature on Aeromonas are shown in Table 1.1a and given below.

· Surface water， especially recreational

【37】· Drinking water， including treated， well， and bottled

【38】· Polluted waters

【39】·Waste water effluent sludge The organism grows at a range of temperatures from 0°C to 42C.

【40】Characterization and classification of Aeromonas 通用删除6(英):<u>\[2\]</u>

【41】· Aeromonads are ubiquitous inhabitants of fresh and brackish water.

【42】·They have also been recovered from chlorinated tap water， including hospital water supplies.

【43】·They occasionally cause soft tissue infections and sepsis in immunocompro-mised hosts and increasingly have been associated with diarrheal disease.

【44】· Because of recent phylogenetic studies， Aeromonas species have been moved from the family Vibrionaceae to a new family， the Aeromonadaceae.

【45】Microbiologic identification of Aeromonas 通用删除6(英):<u>\[2，3\]</u>

【46】·Oxidase-positive， polar flagella， glucose fermenter， facultative anaerobic GNR.

【47】· Resistant to the vibriostatic agent O/129， and unable to grow in 6.5% NaCl.

【48】· Hemolysis is variable but most are beta-hemolytic on BA media.

【49】· There are a few useful standard biochemical tests (A. hydrophila is catalase pos-itive and motile， converts nitrate to nitrite， and is urease negative).

【50】Antimicrobial susceptibility tests of motile Aeromonas spp 通用删除6(英):<u>\[2\]</u>

【51】·Most strains are resistant to penicillin， ampicillin， carbenicillin， and ticarcillin.

【52】· Most are susceptibleeto second- and third-generation cephalosporins， aminoglycosides， (carbapenems)， chloramphenicol， tetracyclines， trimetho-prim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX)， and fluoroquinolones. In the case presented here， the Aeromonas was resistant to carbapenems， ampicillin， and first-generation cephalosporins.

【53】· Higher resistance patterns (to TMP-SMX， tetracycline， and some extended-spectrum cephalosporins) have been found in Taiwan and Spain.

【54】· Therapy with ampicillin or first-generation cephalosporins is not appropriate.

【55】Lessons learned from this case

【56】·Think of wound contamination with any complex laceration injury.

【57】· Culture of the wound is critical before antibiotics are prescribed.

【58】·No complete closure of wound， especially when environmental contamination is known or anticipated， as in this case.

【59】· The patient should be advised to take the antibiotics or report if there are prob-lems， so adjustments may be made. The patient in this case did not take the prescribed antibiotics because of nausea.

【60】· Inspect wounds regularly for signs of inflammation or infection (pus， redness， pain， swelling， induration， or drainage).

【61】· Think of the epidemiology (type of injury， environment， place， and season of the year) of the injury， and likely organisms expected in the given circum-stances王磊
