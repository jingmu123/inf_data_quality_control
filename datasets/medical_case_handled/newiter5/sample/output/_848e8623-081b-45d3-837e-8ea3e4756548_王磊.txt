【1】Atopic dermatitis
-----------------

【2】QUESTION 1

【3】An 11-year-old girl presents to the pediatric dermatology clinic as a referral for a persistently itchy rash that involves the face, neck, trunk and extremities. She has been treated by her pediatrician for atopic dermatitis (AD). The pediatrician has been treating the areas with topical hydrocortisone 2.5% cream, which has not helped control the symptoms. Her mother states that despite using generous emollients and hydrocortisone, the girl scratches rigorously at night and is unable to concentrate during school due to pruritus. She has a past medical history of moderate intermittent asthma and allergic rhinitis, and her mother reports a strong history of asthma on her side of the family without any dermatologic issues. On physical examination, there is extensive generalized xerosis of the skin with areas of eczematous lichenified plaques, many with secondary excoriations and hypopigmentation 通用删除7(英):<u>( 1 )</u>.

【4】i. What is the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis?

【5】ii. What are the ‘atopic stigmata’?

【6】iii. What treatments are on the therapeutic ladder for atopic dermatitis?

【7】Answer 1

【8】i. Atopic dermatitis also commonly known as eczema, is a common chronic inflammatory disorder of the skin, with a prevalence of up to 30% in children and 10% in adults. Atopic dermatitis is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. There are two sets of genes that have been implicated: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> genes encoding epidermal proteins such as filaggrin ( FLG ) and serine protease inhibitor LETKI ( SPINK5 ) and 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> genes encoding immunologic proteins such as high-affinity IgE receptors ( FCER1A ), toll-like receptor-2 ( TLR-2 ) and different interleukins ( IL4, IL5, IL12B, IL13 ), among others. Ichthyosis vulgaris, which is an autosomal semidominant disorder of the skin caused by a mutation in FLG , is seen in up to 15% of patients with AD.

【9】Due to genetic factors, patients with atopic dermatitis have an impaired epidermal barrier that is characterized by epidermal barrier dysfunction and increased transepidermal water loss as a result of an altered stratum corneum.

【10】ii. Atopic stigmata are associated features observed in patients with atopic dermatitis. One of the most important cutaneous features observed in patients with atopic dermatitis is xerosis, characterized by dry skin with fine scale, often worse during the winter. Xerosis promotes pruritus, which can lead to inflammation through the release of proinflammatory cytokines by keratinocytes due to scratching.

【11】Additional stigmata include palmar hyperlinearity, white dermatographism, periorbital darkening, pityriasis alba, infraorbital folds (Dennie–Morgan lines), hypodense lateral eyebrows (Hertoghe’s sign) and low hairline.

【12】iii. Given the extent and areas of involvement, more potent topical steroids would be appropriate for this patient based on the therapeutic ladder for atopic dermatitis. Triamcinolone 0.1% is appropriate for use on most areas of the skin, excluding the skin folds and face, whereas thicker lichenified plaques can be treated with topical corticosteroids with high or very high potency such as fluocinonide or clobetasol, respectively. In addition to topical steroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus, pimecrolimus) have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of AD in prospective controlled trials. Adjunctive therapies include dilute bleach baths, oral antihistamines for antipruritic and sedative effects, cool mist room vaporizers and antibacterial soaps.

【13】Other potential treatments include narrowband UV therapy, cyclosporine, azathioprine, methotrexate and mycophenolate mofetil. The use of systemic corticosteroids should be limited because other agents have a more favourable long-term side-effect profile.王磊
