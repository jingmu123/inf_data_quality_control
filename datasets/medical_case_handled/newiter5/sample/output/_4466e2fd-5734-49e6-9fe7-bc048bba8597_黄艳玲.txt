【0】Question: A 19-year-old woman with no significant past medical history presents to her primary care physician for a sports physical. Her examination is notable for a brachial artery pressure of 160/110 mm Hg and a weak femoral pulse. Prompted by the weak pulse, her physician measures her blood pressure in the lower extremity and finds it to be 80/40 mm Hg. An x-ray film of the chest shows rib notching. This woman is presenting with a congenital condition that places her at high risk for bacterial endocarditis and which of the following other conditions?

【1】> (A) Acute lymphocytic leukemia

【2】> (B) Boot-shaped heart

【3】> (C) Cerebral hemorrhage

【4】> (D) Cor pulmonale

【5】> (E) Eisenmenger syndrome

【6】 Answer: The correct answer is C . A blood pressure in the upper extremity significantly greater than in the lower extremity, a weak to nonexistent femoral pulse, and rib notching on chest x-ray are all consistent with postductal coarctation of the aorta. This condition is associated with a high risk of bacterial endocarditis and cerebral hemorrhage. Postductal coarctation is caused by an abnormal constriction of the aorta distal to the ductus arteriosus during fetal development.  
Answer A is incorrect . Acute lymphocytic leukemia is associated with Down syndrome, which is also associated with an increased risk of an atrial septal defect. However, this is not associated with coarctation of the aorta.  
Answer B is incorrect . A boot-shaped heart refers to the cardiac silhouette produced in cases of isolated right ventricular hypertrophy, classically seen in tetralogy of Fallot. While aortic coarctation may theoretically lead to right ventricular hypertrophy, it will do so only after the left ventricle has hypertrophied and thus will not produce the boot-shaped silhouette.  
Answer D is incorrect . Cor pulmonale is defined as heart failure secondary to lung disease. If lung disease produces pulmonary hypertension, it will lead to right-sided failure. Since aortic coarctation is not lung disease, it cannot be associated with cor pulmonale.  
Answer E is incorrect . Eisenmenger syndrome is the secondary development of cyanosis in conditions that produce a left-to-right shunt, such as ventricular septal defects. The increased blood flow in the pulmonary circulation leads to pulmonary hypertension, which raises the pressure on the right side of the heart, eventually reversing the shunt. Because blood is now shunted right to left, avoiding the pulmonary circulation, cyanosis develops. Aortic coarctation does not produce a left-to-right shunt and thus does not lead to Eisenmenger syndrome.黄艳玲
