【0】29.1A 43-year-old health care worker complains of nocturnal wrist pain and has significant pain when pressure is applied to her volar wrist for more than10 seconds. Which of the following structures is not usually contained within the carpal tunnel?

【1】ATendon(s) of FDPBTendon(s) of FPL

【2】C.Palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve

【3】Tendon(s) of FDS

【4】DEMotor fibers of the median nerve

【5】29.2A 52-year-old retired woman is referred to your clinic with complaints of numbness and tingling in her left (dominant) hand worse at night for the past 3 months. She also complains of significant fatigue and 10-lb weight gain over the same period of time. She denies any medical history and takes no medications. On exam， she is overweight and appears somewhat lethargic， but appears healthy otherwise. On her left hand she has decreased 2-point discrimination on her index and middle fingers. Her grip strength is normal， and she has no thenar atrophy. What is the next best step in management of this patient?

【6】ALeft hand carpal tunnel releaseBEMG/nerve conduction velocity studies of left upper extremity

【7】C. Cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

【8】D.Lab studies including complete blood count， basic metabolic panel， thyroid-stimulating hormone， T3， and free T4

【9】E. Referral for counseling regarding recent changes in her lifestyle

【10】29.3A 56-year-old postmenopausal woman is seen in the clinic with complaints of mild numbness and tingling in her right hand， most notably in the index and middle fingers. She takes medication for osteoporosis but is otherwise healthy. Her history is unremarkable except for a wrist fracture after a fall onto her right hand 2 years ago that was fixed with open reduction internal fixation. Her postoperative course was uncomplicated. Physical examination in the office reveals a well-healed surgical incision on the volar aspect of her wrist， normal grip strength， and no sensory deficits. X-rays reveal hardware in adequate alignment， with evidence of bony union at a previous distal radius fracture site. What is the next best step in her management?

【11】A. Provision cast immobilization and follow-up x-ray for occult refracture

【12】B.MRI of right wrist

【13】C. Emergency surgical release of transverse carpal ligament

【14】D. NSAID administration with close follow-up

【15】F. Serum erythrocyte sedimentation rate， C-reactive protein， complete blood count， and wrist aspiration， with cytologic analysis， Gram stain， and culture of aspirate

【16】29.1 C. The palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve is given off approxi-mately 5 cm proximally to the carpal tunnel in most patients. This explains why patients with carpal tunnel syndrome typically have sparing of sensa-tion of the thenar/palmar aspect of the affected hand. The motor fibers of the median nerve branch off distally to the tunnel， and as a result， patients may exhibit weakness and/or atrophy of the thenar musculature. The 9 flexor ten-dons of FDP， FDS， and FPL are all contained within the carpal tunnel.

【17】29.2 D. The patient in this question does exhibit symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. However， her history and physical exam also point strongly to undiagnosed hypothyroidism. Further workup and treatment of her meta-bolic condition should be performed before intervention of her carpal tunnel symptoms.

【18】29.3D. Distal radius fractures and subsequent fixation are associated with a num-ber of potential complications， including iatrogenic carpal tunnel syndrome of variable severity. In this case， the patient does have postoperative symptoms that are consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome， but they are mild and inter-mittent. Acute or emergency carpal tunnel release is not indicated. There are no signs of infection or refracture， and cast immobilization may exacerbate her symptoms. MRI of the wrist would not likely provide any new information. The correct choice would be conservative management with close follow-up to monitor for change in symptoms.

【19】CLINICALPEARLS

【20】The carpal tunnel is an effectively closed space， containing the median nerve， among other structures. Any reduction in volume of this finite space can lead to increased pressure upon， and thus dysfunction of， the median nerve. This results in carpal tunnel syndrome.

【21】Carpal tunnel syndrome is a clinical diagnosis， made by history and physical exam findings； adjunctive tests such as EMG studies may be used to confirm， but never make， the diagnosis.

【22】Other neurologic conditions or injuries may be differentiated from carpal tunnel syndrome by thorough history and physical exam， including exact localization of motor and sensory symptoms.

【23】Conservative management should always be attempted before operative treatment of CTS. If conservative management fails， surgical carpal tunnel release is performed with either open or endoscopic techniques. Both meth-ods are associated with excellent outcomes.王磊
