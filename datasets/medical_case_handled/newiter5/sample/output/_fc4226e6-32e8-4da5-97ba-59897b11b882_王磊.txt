【1】INSTRUCTION

【2】Examine this patient.

【3】SALIENT FEATURES

【4】History

【5】Age of onset

【6】Rate of progression of hirsutism

【7】History of thinning of scalp hair， or deepening of voice

【8】History of obesity

【9】Drug history： corticosteroids， androgen， phenytoin， minoxidil， diazox-ide， ciclosporin

【10】Take a menstrual history： oligomenorrhoea， infertility， acne， seborrhoea or voice change suggest polycystic ovaries

【11】●Family history (familial).

【12】Examination

【13】●Excessive hair growth， particularly over the face 删除38：<u>(</u>Note： The amount and distribution of hair is an index of androgen effect. Terminal hairs on the face， around the areolae or on the lower abdomen or lower back may be normal， but hair on the upper back， shoulders and upper abdomen suggests a more marked increase in androgen production.
Proceed as follows：

【14】●Tell the examiner that you would like to：

【15】check the BP and urine for sugar

【16】●look for signs of virilization (receding hairline， muscular develop-ment， breast atrophy， clitoromegaly).

【17】●Comment on cushingoid features， if any.

【18】DIAGNOSIS

【19】This patient has hirsutism (lesion) caused by polycystic ovarian disease(etiology) that is cosmetically unacceptable (functional status).

【20】QUESTIONS

【21】What do you understand by the term hirsutism?

【22】Hirsutism is the male pattern of hair growth in women and consists of excessive terminal hair (androgen-sensitive hair). It is abnormal， particu-larly on the chin， sternum， upper abdomen and upper back in women. Terminal hair may normally occur on the arms， legs， upper lips， linea alba and periareolar area in women. To be active in hair follicles， testosterone has to be converted locally to dihydrotestosterone by 5o-reductase. The sensitivity of the hair follicle to androgens is governed largely by cutane-ous 5o-reductase activity. Consequently， similar androgen production profiles may produce different hair growth patterns in different women. Even in hirsute women， hair growth may have greatly variable patterns.

【23】The degree of hirsutism can be assessed by the Ferriman-Gallwey Score， which records distribution and severity of excess body hair on a scale of1-4 for nine regions 删除10：<u>(J Clin Endocrinol Metab 1961；21：1440-7)</u>.

【24】Why do you want to take a menstrual history?

【25】If menstruation is normal， it indicates that there is no increase in testoster-one production. However， if menstruation is abnormal， the commonest cause is polycystic ovary disease (POCD or Stein-Leventhal syndrome)， which is the underlying cause in 92% of the women with hirsutism (the popular belief that most cases of hirsutism are idiopathic is untrue).

【26】ADVANCED-LEVEL QUESTIONS

【27】What other causes of hirsutism are there?

【28】· Cushing syndrome

【29】●Adrenal or ovarian tumours删除31：<u>●</u>
Acromegaly

【30】Drugs：

【31】those that increase vellus growth： phenytoin， minoxidil， diazoxide， ciclosporin

【32】●those that increase terminal hair growth： androgens.

【33】●Familial

【34】FEthnic： a'male-pattern'of hirsutism is common in women whose ances-tors hail from southern Europe.

【35】What is the relationship between body weight and hirsutism?

【36】Hirsute women are more likely to be obese than non-hirsute women. Therefore， weight loss must be a priority in treating overweight women with hirsutism.
删除14：<u>Q</u>
What is the role of testosterone in hirsutism?

【37】Testosterone is the most potent androgen and is derived directly from ovarian secretion (60%) and from peripheral conversion of androstenedi-one (40%). About 65% of testosterone is strongly bound to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and 33% is weakly bound to albumin. The remaining 2% is free testosterone and can enter target cells to exert its androgenic effect. Other androgens include androstenedione (secreted in equal amounts by adrenals and ovaries) and dehydroepiandrosterone(derived exclusively from the adrenals).

【38】What is the pathophysiology of polycystic ovary disease?

【39】It is caused by an abnormality of pulsatile secretion of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH)， which causes increased secretion of luteiniz-ing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). This results in hyperplasia of the ovarian thecal cell leading to multiple follicular cysts and excessive androgen synthesis and anovulation.

【40】Remember： POCD is the association of hyperandrogenism with chronic anovulation in women without specific underlying diseases of adrenals or pituitary glands.

【41】How would you investigate suspected polycystic ovary disease?

【42】●Ovarian ultrasonography is the most accurate investigation； typically it shows thickened capsules， multiple cysts of 3-5 mm diameter and a hyperechogenic stroma 删除38：<u>(</u>Biochemistry：
●Total testosterone levels may be normal， but free androgens are raised

【43】SHBG is low

【44】LH：FSH ratio is raised， usually greater than 2：1， but FSH level is low or normal

【45】●Mild hyperprolactinaemia is common and rarely exceeds 1500 mU/1.

【46】Is glucose metabolism affected in polycystic ovary disease?

【47】POCD is associated with hyperinsulinaemia and insulin resistance， and consequently patients may have impaired glucose tolerance. The site of insulin resistance is skeletal muscle and fatty tissue， not the liver (as in 删除换行1 non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus). It is believed that full expression of POCD requires both the insulin abnormality and the disorder of andro-gen biosynthesis.

【48】How would you treat hirsutism?

【49】● Treatment is directedtowards the underlyingcause of hyper-androgenism

【50】●Mild hyperandrogenism that is idiopathic or mild POCD： oral contra-ceptives

【51】Severe hirsutism： anti-androgens (spironolactone， cyproterone acetate， flutamide) and finasteride (5o-reductase inhibitor) prevent the cutane-ous conversion of testosterone to active dihydrotestosterone； GnRH analogues (leuprolide， nafarelin)

【52】Local treatment： shaving， epilation， laser-assisted epilation (phototri-cholysis)， waxing， electrolysis or bleaching.
