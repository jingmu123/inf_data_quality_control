【15】ANSWERS

【16】19.1 A. Beta-adrenergic blocking agents like atenolol and propranolol taken just before the event have been shown to be effective in treating anxiety associated with performance situations.

Answer B (prefrontal cortex) is thought to be associated with personality development. Answer C(pituitary) is a master endocrine gland that helps regulate many of the endo-crine functions of the body. Ans wer E (corpus callosum) allows signals from the two sides of the brain to communicate.
