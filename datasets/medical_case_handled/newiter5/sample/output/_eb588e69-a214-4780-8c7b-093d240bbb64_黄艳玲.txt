【0】WARTS

【1】Warts (or Verrucae) are patches of hyperkeratotic  删除换行1 overgrown skin. Such overgrowth of skin is often  删除换行1 stimulated by virus.

【2】Warts may occur at any age but are most common  删除换行1 in children, adolescents and young adults. The symptoms  删除换行1 are usually disfiguring. Warts tend to occur on sites of  删除换行1 trauma e.g hands, feet and genital region. These lesions  删除换行1 first appear as small smooth nodules, when they are better  删除换行1 palpable than inspectable. Sometimes these are quite  删除换行1 painful as seen on the sole. These are usually multiple.
The presumed mode of transmission is virus, contact or  删除换行1 autoinoculation. Warts are only painful if they are rubbed  删除换行1 or become infected.

【3】Once warts appear, they may persist for many years  删除换行1 or regress spontaneously. Sometimes family history may  删除换行1 be obtained.

【4】Three types of warts may be seen :—

【5】1. The common warts, which have been described 删除换行1 above.

【6】2. Senile warts (Basal cell papilloma).

【7】3. Venereal warts or papilloma accuminata.

【8】1. The common warts can be conveniently classified  删除换行1 into 3 groups —

【9】(a) Verruca vulgaris is the most frequent type and  删除换行1 occurs anywhere on the skin or oral mucosa — the  删除换行1 common area is the hands. These are greyish white or  删除换行1 brown and are covered with rough, horny surface.

【10】(b) Verruca plana or flat wart is mainly seen on  删除换行1 the face and dorsal surface of the hand. This is slightly  删除换行1 elevated, flat, smooth, papules measuring approximately 2  删除换行1 to 5 mm across.

【11】(c) Verruca plantaris or palmaris is hyperkeratotic  删除换行1 lesion measuring approximately 3 to 15 mm across. As  删除换行1 the name suggests it occurs mainly on the sole or palm.

【12】Histological features of all these warts includeSKIN AND SUBCUTANEOUS TISSUE 17 删除换行1 epidermal hyperplasia, vacuolisation of the cytoplasm  删除换行1 of keratinocytes and presence of eosinophilic cytoplasmic  删除换行1 inclusions and deeply basophilic nuclei. Intranuclear viral  删除换行1 particles may be seen with electron microscopy.

【13】Treatment is mainly curettage and diathermy. Irritant  删除换行1 podophyllin in the strength of 50% in liquid paraffin  删除换行1 may be applied with good result. The best treatment  删除换行1 however is application of liquid nitrogen which is the  删除换行1 most effective. Surgical excision is not recommended as  删除换行1 it leads to bad scarring and recurrence rate is quite high.

【14】2. Senile wart or Basal cell papilloma or Seborrhoeic  删除换行1 wart or Seborrhoeic keratosis.— As the name suggests it  删除换行1 mainly occurs in elderly people passed middle age. It is  删除换行1 more common in Caucasians but quite rare in the blacks  删除换行1 and Indian subcontinent. Both sexes are equally affected.
In men it usually appears in the 5th decade or later,  删除换行1 whereas in women it occurs at the time of menopause.
One may find a familial history as it is often transmitted  删除换行1 by autosomal dominant gene. It is a benign tumour, often  删除换行1 pigmented and develops in the large numbers on the  删除换行1 trunk, arms and face.

【15】Pathologically it consists of two layers, the base is  删除换行1 formed by dermis and the outer surface is formed by  删除换行1 thin keratotic epidermis. Between these 2 layers there is  删除换行1 plenty of immature epidermal cells which may be carried  删除换行1 to the surface for shedding. Malignant transformation is  删除换行1 uncommon.

【16】This lesion often starts as an inflammatory dermatosis.
Ultimately this lesion becomes ovoid measuring about 1  删除换行1 mm to several centimetres. As mentioned above it is more  删除换行1 common on the upper trunk and face. This lesion hardly  删除换行1 shows any tendency towards spontaneous regression.

【17】Treatment is removal by curettage which gradually  删除换行1 heals with normal epithelium in about a week's time.
Cryosurgery is now being performed with better success.

【18】3. Venereal wart or Condyloma acuminatum.— These  删除换行1 occur on the penis, perianal area, rectum, perineum and  删除换行1 female genitalia. This lesion appears as soft, tan, raspberryor cauliflower-like mass. Venereal warts are often seen in  删除换行1 the coronal sulcus of the penis. These are multiple and  删除换行1 moist warts with offensive serous discharge.

【19】Venereal warts are treated by (i) fulguration with  删除换行1 diathermy or (ii) by podophyllin — 10 to 20% solution  删除换行1 with tincture benzoin is used.

【20】IiASAL CELL CARCINOMA (SYN. RODENT 删除换行3 ULCER)

【21】This is a locally invasive carcinoma of the basal layer  删除换行1 of the epidermis. It is of low grade malignancy. This is 删除换行1 particularly liable to occur in fair and dry skinned people  删除换行1 constantly exposed to sunlight. Elderly subjects are usually  删除换行1 affected.

【22】Aetiology.—

【23】1. Elderly people are usually affected. The  删除换行1 patients are in middle or late age.

【24】2. It affects males more often than females.

【25】3. It is particularly seen in the white residing in  删除换行1 tropical countries.

【26】4. It grows very slowly, often over a course of  删除换行1 many years.

【27】5- Exposure to sunlight seems to be an important  删除换行1 aetiologic factor, that is why this lesion is usually confined  删除换行1 to the face.

【28】6. Rodent ulcer is particularly prevalent in 

【29】Australia and is confined to white people of the labour  删除换行1 class whose skin is exposed to the bright sunlight of  删除换行1 high actinic value.

【30】7. It is seldom seen in the black people.

【31】8. The tumour is frequently multiple and the  删除换行1 multiple growths may be confined to one area or may  删除换行1 occur in different areas.

【32】9. Multiple basal cell carcinomas may develop in  删除换行1 persons following prolonged administration of arsenic  删除换行1 usually in the form of liquor arsenicalis. Arsenic was also  删除换行1 previously used in skin ointments.

【33】10. 90% of basal cell carcinoma is seen in the  删除换行1 face above a line from the corner of the mouth to the  删除换行1 lobule of the ear. The commonest site being around the  删除换行1 inner canthus of the eye.

【34】Pathology.—

【35】Macroscopic features.— Although it is called rodent  删除换行1 ulcer, many of the lesions are nonulcerated. The different  删除换行1 macroscopic types are :—

【36】(i) Deeply eroding ulcer or rodent ulcer. Such an  删除换行1 ulcer has a typical rolled edge (not everted), often beaded  删除换行1 and the floor showing scabbing over some areas and  删除换行1 breaking at others. This is the commonest type.

【37】(ii) Nodular type.

【38】(iii) Cystic type •— a large semi-transparent nodule  删除换行1 with darkly translucent colour as it contains water with  删除换行1 a network of fiery red blood vessels on the surface.

【39】(iv) Pigmented nodule, in which the whole or part  删除换行1 of the lesion is dark brown in colour. See Fig. 1.15.

【40】(v) Field fire or Forest fire or Geographical variety

【41】— with advancing edge and healing centre. It has an  删除换行1 irregular raised edge around flat white scar.

【42】(vi) Morphoric type, in which the lesion is a firm  删除换行1 raised red plaque.

【43】Microscopic features.—

【44】Ir consists of densely packed islands of darkly stained  删除换行1 cells which extend down from the epidermis, although  删除换行1 often no connection with the epidermis may be seen.
The cells on the periphery of the islands are more deeply  删除换行1 stained and have palisade' arrangement. There are no  删除换行1 cell nests or keratinisation. Prickle cells are also absent.
Mitotic figures are usually absent. Stromal component is  删除换行1 composed of benign fibrovascular tissue and chronic  删除换行1 inflammatory cells.

【45】Basal cell carcinomas have varying rate of growth.
Some remain small for long period of time, while others  删除换行1 grow rapidly and destroy large areas. Those that ulcerate  删除换行1 early, particularly in the nasolabial fold, behave  删除换行1 aggressively.

【46】Origin.—

【47】As mentioned earlier the common belief is that the  删除换行1 basal cell carcinoma arises from the basal layer of the  删除换行1 epidermis. But occasionally a basal cell tumour arises from  删除换行1 the basal cells of the hair follicles and sweat glands. Such  删除换行1 tumours are mostly seen in the scalp and adolescents are  删除换行1 the usual victims. Such tumour is called 'turban tumour' or  删除换行1 epithelioma adenoides cysticum'.

【48】Spread.—

【49】Basal cell carcinoma usually spreads by local invasion.
It gradually destroys the tissues it comes in contact with.
That is why this tumour is called 'rodent ulcer'. Lymphatic  删除换行1 spread is not seen, so the regional lymph nodes are not  删除换行1 enlarged. Similarly blood spread is also extremely rare.

【50】Clinical features.—

【51】SYMPTOMS.—

【52】The principal complaint is of a persisting lesion —

【53】either an ulcer or a nodule. It is not painful in the  删除换行1 beginning, though it may itch. The lesion grows slowly  删除换行1 and a little bleeding may be complained of. If untreated  删除换行1 rodent ulcer 删除换行1 becomes quite big  删除换行1 and deep. It then  删除换行1 may cause pain and  删除换行1 bleeding and may  删除换行1 become infected.

【54】Basal cell carcinoma  删除换行1 is more known for  删除换行1 its multiplicity.

【55】LOCAL EXAMINATIONS.—

【56】(i) Site .—

【57】Though no site is  删除换行1 exempted, yet 90%  删除换行1 of basal cell  删除换行1 carcinoma is seen  删除换行1 on the face above  删除换行1 the line drawn  删除换行1 from the angle of  删除换行1 the mouth to the  删除换行1 lobule of the ear.

【58】The common sites are :

【59】(a) Around inner canthus of the eye.

【60】(b) Around outer canthus of the eye. Fig. 1.19.

【61】(c) Nose.

【62】(d) On and around nasolabial fold. Fig. 1.18.

【63】(e) On the forehead — more common in 删除换行1 females.

【64】In fact, the rodent ulcer may be seen more  删除换行1 commonly in places of the face over which tear rolls  删除换行1 down. That is why it is aptly called a ' Tear cancer .

【65】This lesion is also seen in the scalp, neck, arms  删除换行1 and hands (i.e. the exposed areas of skin).

【66】(ii) The lesion.— The tumour always starts as a

【67】删除3：<u>Fig.1.16.— Dotted areas are the  删除换行1 common sites of basal cell carcinoma.</u>
The density of dots indicate frequency  删除换行1 of incidence of this type of carcinoma.
It is commonest around inner canthus  删除换行1 of the eye and around the nasolabial  删除换行1 furrow along the line on which tear rolls  删除换行1 down. That is why this cancer is often  删除换行1 called Tear Cancer.'

【68】删除3：<u>Fig.1.17.— A pigmented basal cell carcinoma </u>

【69】删除3：<u>Fig. 1.15.— Shows an early lesion of basal cell carcinoma at the outer canthus of the eye. It is often difficult 删除换行1 showing a small 'pearly' nodule. to differentiate from a melanoma.SKIN AND SUBCUTANEOUS TISSUE 19 删除换行1 nodule. Gradually the centre of the nodule dies and an  删除换行1 ulcer results. Such an ulcer has a rolled edge i.e. raised  删除换行1 and rounded (not everted cf. epithelioma). As the growth  删除换行1 spreads, the shape of the ulcer becomes irregular. An  删除换行1 irregular raised edge around a flat white scar is sometimes  删除换行1 called a field fire or geographical basal cell carcinoma.</u>
When the ulcer erodes deeper structures, the edge becomes  删除换行1 more prominent, but does never become everted.

【70】The floor of a rodent ulcer is covered with a coat of  删除换行1 dried serum and epithelial cells. If this sheds off, the  删除换行1 ulcer will bleed.

【71】The base of the ulcer consists of the tissue which  删除换行1 the tumour is eroding, either fat or muscle or bone.

【72】If the centre of the nodule dies an ulcer is formed,  删除换行1 if it does not die the nodule continues to develop. The  删除换行1 nodule gradually becomes large and may look cystic. But  删除换行1 it should be remembered that being a solid tumour, it  删除换行1 cannot be truely cystic, though 'cystic rodent ulcer' term  删除换行1 can be used. It is neither fluctuant nor does it contain  删除换行1 fluid inside it, though some oedema may be present.

【73】(iii) Regional lymph nodes — are usually not enlarged.
If these are enlarged the diagnosis should be reconsidered.黄艳玲
