        "text": "【0】Case 10\nA 21-year-old nulliparous woman complains of lower abdominal“heaviness.”She takes an oral contraceptive and is in a monogamous relationship. On examination， she has a normal-sized， nontender uterus， and a 9-cm right adnexal mass is palpated. Her pregnancy test is negative. On sonography， the mass appears cystic and solid.\n\n【1】What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【2】What are some of the histologic findings expected in this mass?\n\n【3】ANSWERS TO CASE 10： OVARIAN TERATOMA\n\n【4】Summary： A 21-year-old nulliparous woman has a 9-cm right adnexal mass that on sonography appears cystic and solid.\n\n【5】Most likely diagnosis： Benign cystic teratoma of the ovary\n\n【6】Expected histologic findings in this mass： Any tissue may be found， but the most common are sebum， skin， hair， teeth， thyroid， and neurologic tissues\n\n【7】CLINICAL CORRELATION\n\n【8】This young woman has an ovarian mass that on ultrasound has cystic and solid components， a classic presentation of a benign cystic teratoma (dermoid cyst) of the ovary. Although benign cystic teratomas are often asymptomatic，larger dermoids (as in this case) can present with pelvic pain， pressure， fullness， or dyspareunia. The patient's pregnancy test was reported as negative； however， in rare cases， degenerating ectopic pregnancies can be missed with urine human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) assays because of the low sensitivity of urine pregnancy tests in the presence of very low (<25 mIU/mL) serum hCG levels. The fact that the patient is engaged in a monogamous relationship should decrease the risks of her contracting gonorrhea or Chlamydia， hence decreasing the possibility of pelvic inflammatory disease and tuboovarian abscess (TOA). The patient also gives a history of oral contraceptive (OC)use， which also serves to decrease the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease and/or TOA. Oral contraceptives also greatly decrease the likelihood of the mass being a physiologic ovarian mass (follicular cyst， hemorrhagic corpus luteum cyst， etc.). The ultrasound shows a complex (both cystic and solid) ovarian mass， which also is not consistent with an abscess or a physiologic ovarian or paraovarian cyst.\n\n【9】Although some disagreement exists over the timing and indications for sur-gery in complex masses under 6 cm or simple cysts of any size， a 9-cm com-plex ovarian mass almost always needs to be explored surgically. This is due primarily to the small but not insignificant risk of malignancy. Upon confir-mation of benign intraoperative findings， efforts should be directed at sal-vaging all normal tissue from the affected ovary and removing only that tissue which has undergone neoplastic degeneration.\n\n【10】APPROACH TO OVARIAN NEOPLASM\n\n【11】Objectives\n\n【12】Describe the classifications of ovarian neoplasms.\n\n【13】Describe the serum marker used to evaluate ovarian neoplasms.\n\n【14】Describe the differential for a pelvic mass.\n\n【15】Definitions\n\n【16】Tuboovarian abscess： An abscess formed within the adnexal space con-sisting of ovary， fallopian tube， and matted bowel caused by untreated or inadequately treated pelvic inflammatory disease.\n\n【17】Endometrioma： A large (6- to 8-cm) loculated collection of endometrial tissue that can develop in the pelvis in females with endometriosis. As this tissue degenerates， it turns brownish in color and is known as a“chocolate cyst.”\n\n【18】Struma ovarii： A benign teratoma in which functional thyroid tissue is the predominant histologic finding. Approximately 2 to 3 percent of ter-atomas are classified as struma ovarii. Thyrotoxicosis is clinically appar-ent in 5 percent of these cases.\n\n【19】Ovarian torsion： A condition in which the ovary twists on its attachment to the infundibulopelvic ligament， thus interrupting ovarian blood sup-ply. This usually is seen in conjunction with pathologic enlargement of the ovary and can be dynamic (intermittent) in nature or complete； the latter results in infarction and necrosis of the affected ovary.\n\n【20】DISCUSSION\n\n【21】Although they may present in any decade of life， benign cystic teratomas are the most common ovarian neoplasm found in females under age 35 (excluding physiologic follicular and corpus luteum cysts) and are also the most common ovarian neoplasm found in pregnancy. Approximately 10 to 15 percent of all cases involve both ovaries. Table 10-1 lists the differential diagnoses of a pelvic mass， and Table 10-2 lists the categories of ovarian neoplasms.\n\n【22】Benign cystic teratomas arise from a single germ cell in the ovary and have a normal female karyotype (46，XX). Because of the pluripotent nature of germ cells， teratomas can differentiate into tissues derived from all three embry-ologic cell lines (endoderm， ectoderm， and mesoderm). Thus， a “mature”ter-atoma often contains skin， fat， sebaceous glands， sweat glands， hair， smooth and striated muscle， cartilage， bone， teeth， neural tissue， and gas-trointestinal tissue 删除33：<u></u>. Functional thyroid tissue is found in approximately 12 percent of benign cystic teratomas， and rarely this tissue will proliferate into the predominant cellular element in the teratoma. This unique teratoma hence is referred to as struma ovarii and will secrete enough functional thyroid hormone to cause acute thyrotoxicosis in approximately 5 percent of cases.\n\n【23】Benign cystic teratomas are usually asymptomatic and are found most com-monly during routine gynecologic screening or incidentally during unassoci-ated surgical or radiographic procedures. Larger teratomas give rise to acute adnexal torsion in approximately 11 percent of cases. The increased risk of torsion with teratomas compared with other causes of ovarian enlargement is thought to be due to fat content， allowing the teratoma to “float” in the\n\n【24】Table 10-1DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSES OF A PELVIC MASS\n\n| Full bladder  |\n| --- |\n| Intrauterine or extrauterine pregnancy  |\n| Functional ovarian cysts (follicular or corpus luteum)  |\n| Tuboovarian abscess  |\n| Diverticular abscess  |\n| Appendiceal abscess  |\n| Matted bowel and/or omentum  |\n| Paratubal or paraovarian cyst  |\n| Stool in sigmoid colon  |\n| Leiomyomas (submucosal， subserosal， pedunculated， or intraligamentous)  |\n| Pelvic kidney  |\n| Miuillerian abnormality (e.g.， bicomuate uterus)  |\n| Benign or malignant ovarian tumors  |\n\n【26】abdominal cavity instead of lodging against other structures. Other significant complications include secondary infection and acute hemorrhage with the potential for septic and/or hypovolemic shock. Rupture or perforation is seen in less than 5 percent of cases and occurs more frequently in association with pregnancy. When acute rupture occurs， spillage of the contents of the teratoma into the abdominal cavity often precipitates a surgical emergency， whereas more chronic leakage of contents can produce a severe chemical peritonitis that also requires surgical intervention. Malignant degeneration occurs in less than 2 percent of all recognized teratomas.\n\n【27】Other germ cell tumors include dysgerminomas， endodermal sinus tumors， and choriocarcinomas. These neoplasms usually occur in females under age30 years. Dysgerminomas are rapidly growing and very radiosensitive and chemosensitive. Endodermal sinus tumors often secrete a-fetoprotein， whereas choriocarcinomas secrete human chorionic gonadotropin.\n\n【28】Table 10-2OVARIAN NEOPLASMS\n\n| Benign epithelial ovarian tumors  |\n| --- |\n| Serous cystadenoma  |\n| Mucinous cystadenoma  |\n| Brenner tumor  |\n| Malignant epithelial ovarian tumors  |\n| Serous cystadenocarcinoma  |\n| Mucinous cystadenocarcinoma  |\n| Endometrioid adenocarcinoma  |\n| Transitional cell carcinoma  |\n| Malignant germ cell tumors  |\n| Dysgerminoma  |\n| Endodermal sinus tumor  |\n| Embryonal carcinoma  |\n| Polyembryonal carcinoma  |\n| Choriocarcinoma  |\n| Teratoma (immature)  |\n| Benign germ cell tumors  |\n| Benign cystic teratoma (dermoid)  |\n| Sex cord-stromal tumors  |\n| Thecoma  |\n| Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor  |\n| Granulosa-theca cell tumor  |\n\n【30】Epithelial tumors of the ovary most commonly affect females over age30 years， particularly postmenopausal women. Malignant serous cystadeno-carcinomas are the most common， usually presenting with ascites. Treatment includes surgical excision followed by combination chemotherapy. Mucinous tumors may become very large， sometimes exceeding 30 lb in weight； their rupture can lead to chronic bouts of bowel obstruction (pseudomyxoma peritonei).\n\n【31】Stromal tumors of the ovary are often functional， secreting estrogen(granulosa-theca cell tumors) or androgens (Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors). These neoplasms can present as precocious puberty， postmenopausal bleeding， or hirsutism. They are usually solid tumors that are slow growing and rarely metastasize early. Surgery is the best treatment for these tumors.\n\n【32】删除3：<u>Figure 10-1. Gross photograph of an ovarian teratoma. Note the hair. (Courtesy of Dr. Aaron Han， Reading， PA.)</u>",

His  删除换行1 wife says that his personality has ‘changed completely’ over the past 2 years. He has become  删除换行1 increasingly suspicious and cantankerous. He often misplaces objects and then accuses her of  删除换行1 stealing from him and has made similar accusations against close friends. Previously a placid  删除换行1 person, he has now become irritable and aggressive. She feels that his ‘mood swings’ are now  删除换行1 becoming intolerable. However, he says that his wife is making an ‘unnecessary fuss’. He  删除换行1 acknowledges being a ‘bit low’ after taking premature retirement 2 years ago, but does not feel  删除换行1 that there is anything really wrong with him. He appears twitchy, displaying sudden ‘jerky’  删除换行1 movements of his arms and neck. He dismisses them as ‘nervous tics’. His wife, however, feels  删除换行1 that he is getting clumsy, dropping things and occasionally even stumbling.\n\n【2】There is no previous psychiatric history although he says he took premature retirement due  删除换行1 to stress. There is no past medical history of note. His father died at the age of 60 following a  删除换行1 ‘nervous breakdown’ in his final years but he cannot provide you with any more details. There  删除换行1 is no other significant family history. The couple has a son, 30, and a daughter, 25, who live  删除换行1 close by. They live in their own home.\n\n【3】Mental state examination\n\n【4】He is a tall, thin gentleman, who establishes a good rapport. His speech appears a little slurred  删除换行1 at times but is coherent and relevant. He displays sudden jerky movements of his arms, shoulder and neck. There is no evidence of thought disorder. He is convinced that his wife and his  删除换行1 friends have stolen money and a few of his personal objects. He acknowledges that there is no  删除换行1 obvious motive but yet remains convinced about this. He appears low in mood but does not  删除换行1 have any ideas of self-harm or suicide. He has little insight into his symptoms and blames it  删除换行1 all on ‘stress’. On cognitive examination, he appears a little confused about the date and time  删除换行1 and is rather clumsy on motor tasks such as writing. Mini Mental State Examination reveals  删除换行1 a score of 23/30 with losses on tasks of orientation (three points), tasks of concentration (two  删除换行1 points), three-object recall (one point) and construction (one point).\n\n【5】Questions\n\n【6】• What is the differential diagnosis?\n\n【7】• What investigations are indicated?\n\n【8】• How will you manage this patient?\n\n【9】ANSWER 34\n\n【10】Pre-senile onset of cognitive, emotional and behavioural changes associated with movement disorder, in the presence of a family history, should arouse strong suspicion of the  删除换行1 progressive degenerative disorder, Huntington disease (HD). The disease usually presents  删除换行1 in the fourth or fifth decade, often presenting with psychiatric symptoms, most commonly  删除换行1 personality changes, emotional disturbance and paranoia. Paranoid ideas of reference with  删除换行1 frank delusions of persecution may be the earliest symptoms often associated with depression  删除换行1 and anxiety. Behavioural agitation, often associated with aggression and violence, may be  删除换行1 seen independently of choreiform movement disorder. Choreiform movements are regular,  删除换行1 uncontrollable, random, brief muscle jerks and movements. These are different from athetoid movements, which involve writhing and twisting movements. Choreiform movements  删除换行1 may initially be very mild and may go unnoticed for years but become florid and disabling  删除换行1 as the disease progresses. Insidious cognitive impairment ultimately leads to severe dementia. Initially, the clinical picture resembles paranoid schizophrenia. Other psychiatric differential diagnoses include psychotic depression, bipolar disorder or schizoaffective disorder.Other causes of dementia such as Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia, Wilson’s disease,  删除换行5 Parkinson’s disease and neuroacanthocytosis also need to be considered as do other conditions such as multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), neurosyphilis and druginduced cerebellar disorder.\n\n【11】A high index of clinical suspicion is needed to make the correct diagnosis as up to a third  删除换行1 of cases are wrongly labelled as schizophrenia. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic  删除换行1 resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans reveal dilated ventricles with atrophy of the caudate  删除换行1 nuclei and are therefore indicated in all first-time presentations of psychosis. Genetic testing  删除换行1 is diagnostic with the identification of multiple cytosine/adenine/guanine (CAG) repeats on  删除换行1 the short arm of chromosome 4. The normal gene shows 11–34 repeats while in HD 37–120  删除换行1 repeats are seen. Pre-test genetic counselling is vital as the diagnosis of the disease has implications for the patient’s children with a strong likelihood (50%) of one of them being affected.\nIt is autosomal dominant.\n\n【12】The disease is progressive and incurable with treatment directed towards palliation of symptoms. Mean survival time is 15–18 years. Psychotic symptoms such as agitation, delusions and  删除换行1 hallucinations and movement disorders can be treated with atypical (clozapine) or typical  删除换行1 (haloperidol) antipsychotic medication and tranquillizers such as clonazepam. Depressive  删除换行1 episodes usually respond to selective serotonin reuptake inhibiting antidepressants such as  删除换行1 fluoxetine or sertraline. Manic features may need a mood stabilizer (e.g. lithium) in addition to antipsychotic medication. Obsessive rituals may need treatment with anti-obsessional \n\n【13】Prevalance of co-morbid psychiatric symptoms\n\n【14】Co-morbid psychiatric symptoms 删除换行1 删除10：<u>(Van Duijn et al. 2007)</u> Prevalence\n\n【15】Depression, anxiety, irritability or apathy Between 33% and 76%\n\n【16】Obsessions and compulsions Between 10% and 50%\n\n【17】Psychosis Up to 10%\n\n【18】Note: Van Duijn E, Kingma EM, Van der Mast RC. 2007.

        "text": "【0】Case Files® Biochemistry, Third Edition    \n\n【1】CASE 24\n-------\n\n【2】A 3-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department after several episodes of vomiting and lethargy. His pediatrician has been concerned about his failure to thrive and possible hepatic failure, along with recurrent episodes of the vomiting and lethargy. After a careful history is taken, you observe that these episodes occur after ingestion of certain types of food, especially those high in fructose. His blood sugar was checked in the emergency department and was extremely low.\n\n【3】 What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【4】 What is the biochemical basis for the clinical symptoms?\n\n【5】 What is the treatment of the disorder?\n\n【6】### ANSWERS TO CASE 24:\n\n【7】#### Fructose Intolerance\n\n【8】Summary: A 3-year-old boy with failure to thrive and possible hepatic failure. He presents with hypoglycemia and recurrent episodes of nausea and vomiting after ingestion of foods high in fructose.\n\n【9】• Diagnosis: Fructose intolerance.\n\n【10】• Biochemical basis of disorder: Because of a genetic disorder, the hepatic aldolase B enzyme is defective, normally functioning in glycolysis but not in fructose metabolism. Glucose production is inhibited by elevated fructose 1-phosphate. When fructose is ingested, severe hypoglycemia results.\n\n【11】• Treatment: Avoid dietary fructose.\n\n【12】### CLINICAL CORRELATION\n\n【13】Individuals with a deficiency in aldolase B have the condition known as fructose intolerance. As with most enzyme deficiencies, this is an autosomal recessive disease; it does not cause difficulty as long as the patient does not consume any foods with fructose or sucrose. Frequently, children with fructose intolerance avoid candy and fruit—behavior that should cause concern. Likewise, they usually do not have many dental caries. However, if chronically exposed to fructose-containing foods, infants and small children may have poor weight gain and abdominal cramping or vomiting.\n\n【14】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【15】#### Disaccharide Metabolism\n\n【16】### OBJECTIVES\n\n【17】1\\. Describe the metabolism of disaccharides, specifically fructose.\n\n【18】2\\. Explain the role of aldolase B in fructose metabolism.\n\n【19】### DEFINITIONS\n\n【20】DISACCHARIDE: Two sugar molecules (monosaccharides) linked together by a glycosidic bond. The major disaccharides obtained in the diet are maltose \\[4-(α-d-glucosido)-d-glucose\\], sucrose \\[β-d-fructofuranosyl-α-d-glucopyranoside\\], and lactose \\[4-(β-d-galactosido)-d-glucose\\].\n\n【21】ESSENTIAL FRUCTOSURIA: A rare, benign genetic condition in which fructose spills over to the urine because the liver, kidney, and intestine lack the enzyme fructokinase.\n\n【22】FRUCTOKINASE: An enzyme present in the liver, kidney, and intestine that will phosphorylate fructose to fructose 1-phosphate at the expense of adenosine triphosphate (ATP).\n\n【23】FRUCTOSE INTOLERANCE: A genetic deficiency in the liver enzyme aldolase B. The absence of this enzyme leads to a build up of fructose 1-phosphate and depletion of liver ATP and phosphate stores.\n\n【24】GLUT 5: A facilitative glucose transporter isoform present in the small intestine and other tissues that will transport fructose (and glucose to a lesser extent) across the plasma membrane.\n\n【25】β-GLYCOSIDASE: A bifunctional, membrane-bound enzyme located on the brush-border membrane of the small intestine. This single polypeptide enzyme has 2 activities, lactase and glucosylceramidase, located in different domains of the protein. It will hydrolyze lactose to glucose and galactose.\n\n【26】SGLT1: A sodium-dependent glucose transporter located on the luminal side of the intestinal epithelial cells. It will transport glucose and galactose across the intestinal cell using a sodium ion gradient.\n\n【27】SGLT2: A sodium-dependent glucose transporter that has a high specificity for glucose and is specific to the kidney.\n\n【28】SUCRASE-ISOMALTASE COMPLEX: An enzyme complex comprised of 2 enzyme units. Both units have high α-1,4-glucosidase activity and will hydrolyze maltose and maltotriose to glucose. The sucrase unit will also hydrolyze sucrose to fructose and glucose, whereas the isomaltase unit will hydrolyze α-1,6 bonds found in isomaltose and the limit dextrins of starch.\n\n【29】### DISCUSSION\n\n【30】The major disaccharides obtained in the diet are maltose, sucrose, and lactose. Maltose is primarily obtained from the consumption of the plant storage polysaccharide starch . Starch is degraded to glucose and small-branched oligosaccharides called limit dextrins by exhaustive digestion by α-amylase . The limit dextrins are further enzymatically hydrolyzed to a branched tetrasaccharide by glucoamylase and to maltotriose and maltose and ultimately to glucose by the sucrase-isomaltase complex. Both of these enzyme complexes are located on the brush-border membrane of the small intestine. Sucrose , or table sugar, is hydrolyzed to glucose and fructose by the sucrase subunit of the sucrase-isomaltase complex. Lactose , or milk sugar, is enzymatically converted to glucose and galactose by β-glycosidase , also located on the brush-border membrane of the small intestine. This membrane-bound enzyme is a single polypeptide that has lactase and glucosylceramidase activities located in different domains of the protein.\n\n【31】Glucose and galactose are absorbed from the lumen of the intestine by the sodium-dependent glucose transporter (SGLT1) , which is located on the luminal side of the intestinal epithelial cells. Fructose absorption is not dependent on a sodium gradient. It is transported into the intestinal cell by facilitative diffusion by a glucose transporter isoform, GLUT 5 . Fructose transport is less rapid than glucose transport, and GLUT 5 does not have a high capacity. Thus, in most individuals, ingestion of fructose in amounts higher than 0.5 to 1.0 g/kg body weight can result in malabsorption. Fructose enters the bloodstream, along with glucose and galactose, via the GLUT 2 transporter . Fructose is taken up by the liver by the same GLUT 2 transporter, along with glucose and galactose. There is a large gradient between the extracellular and intracellular concentrations of fructose in the liver cells, indicating that the rate for fructose uptake by the hepatocyte is low.\n\n【32】In the liver, kidney, and intestine, fructose can be converted to glycolytic/gluconeogenic intermediates by the actions of 3 enzymes— fructokinase, aldolase B, and triokinase (also called triose kinase)—as shown in Figure 24-1 . In these tissues, fructose is rapidly phosphorylated to fructose 1-phosphate (F1P) by fructokinase at the expense of a molecule of ATP. This has the effect of trapping fructose inside the cell. A deficiency in this enzyme leads to the rare but benign condition known as essential fructosuria . In other tissues such as muscle, adipose, and red blood cells, hexokinase can phosphorylate fructose to the glycolytic intermediate fructose 6-phosphate (F6P).\n\n【33】删除3：<u>Figure 24-1. The metabolic pathway for the entrance of fructose into the glycolytic pathway. Fructokinase rapidly converts fructose to fructose 1-phosphate, which in the liver is cleaved by aldolase B to dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde.</u>\n\n【34】F1P is further metabolized to dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde by the hepatic isoform of the enzyme aldolase, which catalyzes a reversible aldol condensation reaction. Aldolase is present in 3 different isoforms. Aldolase A is present in greatest concentrations in the skeletal muscle , whereas the B isoform predominates in the liver, kidney, and intestine. Aldolase C is the brain isoform. Aldolase B has similar activity for either fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (F16BP) or F1P; however, the A or C isoforms are only slightly active when F1P is the substrate.\n\n【35】Glyceraldehyde may be converted to the glycolytic intermediate, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP) , by the action of the enzyme triokinase. This enzyme phosphorylates glyceraldehyde at the expense of another molecule of ATP. The GAP can then enter into the glycolytic pathway and be further converted to pyruvate, or recombine with DHAP to form F16BP by the action of aldolase.\n\n【36】A deficiency in aldolase B leads to the condition known as fructose intolerance . This inherited condition is benign as long as the patient does not consume any foods with fructose or sucrose. Patients with this condition usually develop an aversion to sweets early in life and as a result frequently are without any caries. However, infants and small children if chronically exposed to fructose-containing foods usually exhibit periods of vomiting and poor feeding as well as failure to thrive. A defect in the aldolase B gene results in a decrease in activity that is 15 percent or less than that of normal controls. This results in a buildup of F1P levels in the hepatocyte. Because the maximal rate of fructose phosphorylation by fructokinase is so high (almost 1 order of magnitude greater than that of glucokinase), intracellular levels of both ATP and inorganic phosphate (P <sub>i </sub> ) are significantly decreased. The drop in ATP concentration adversely affects a number of cellular events, including detoxification of ammonia, formation of cyclic AMP (cAMP), and RNA and protein synthesis. The decrease in intracellular concentrations of P <sub>i </sub> leads to a hyperuricemic condition as a result of an increase in uric acid formation. AMP deaminase is inhibited by normal cellular concentrations of P <sub>i </sub> . When these levels drop, the inhibition is released and AMP is converted to IMP and, ultimately, uric acid 删除33：<u></u>.\n\n【37】删除3：<u>Figure 24-2. The inhibition of AMP deaminase by inorganic phosphate (P <sub>i </sub> ). A decrease in \\[P <sub>i </sub> \\] increases the activity of AMP deaminase and leads to increased production of uric acid.</u>\n\n【38】The toxic effects of F1P can also be exhibited in patients that do not have a deficiency in aldolase B if they are parenterally fed with solutions containing fructose. Parenteral feeding with solutions containing fructose can result in blood fructose concentrations that are several times higher than can be achieved with an oral load. Because the rate of entry into the hepatocyte is dependent on the fructose gradient across the cell, intravenous loading results in increased entry into the liver and increased formation of F1P. Because the rate of formation of F1P is much faster than its further metabolism, this can lead to hyperuricemia and hyperuricosuria by the mechanisms described above.\n\n【39】###",

        "text": "【0】Case Files®: Medical Ethics and Professionalism    \n\n【1】CASE 29\n-------\n\n【2】A 32-year-old woman slips and falls from a 10-foot ladder at work. Her coworkers find her awake and attempting to mouth words, but she is not capable of moving her limbs, and she is barely breathing. When paramedics arrive, she is unconscious and still barely breathing, so they intubate her. At the hospital, she opens her eyes spontaneously and appears to attend when spoken to. She can blink when asked but she cannot move her limbs. She appears to have no sensation below the neck. She is on ventilator support but is generating no spontaneous respiratory movements. When asked about pain, she indicates using blinks and facial gestures that her neck is very painful.\n\n【3】She is then medically sedated in order to obtain imaging studies. Computed tomography (CT) of the cervical spine reveals a burst fracture of the atlas, with bony fragments and soft tissue within the spinal canal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reveals severe edema of the upper cord from the level of the first cervical vertebra to the third. She is admitted to the surgical intensive care unit (ICU). Because she is sedated, the ICU attending and neurosurgeon approach the patient’s husband and parents. The neurosurgeon indicates that the patient is very likely to be permanently quadriplegic and dependent on ventilator support. She recommends surgery as soon as possible to stabilize the upper spine to minimize pain and maximize the likelihood of some neurologic recovery.\n\n【4】To the physicians’ surprise, the patient’s husband and her parents unanimously refuse surgery. Moreover, they explain that they are certain that the patient would refuse all life-sustaining therapy (LST). The patient’s husband has durable power of attorney for health care, also sometimes called a health care proxy, for his wife, and specifically requests that ventilator support be stopped and that she be allowed to die. The husband and parents all indicate that they have had prior discussions about spinal cord injury and disability with the patient, and that she has specifically stated that she “would rather be dead than \\[quadriplegic\\].” When the surgeon suggests waking the patient and discussing the matter with her, the family refuse, claiming that, “We know what she would want, and we’re not going to put her through that. She would definitely not want to go through the trauma of finding out about her condition.”\n\n【5】 Can the patient’s family, acting as the patient’s surrogates, refuse LST on her behalf, knowing that she will die as a result?\n\n【6】 If the patient were awake and refusing LST for herself, should her clinicians stop it, knowing that she will die as a result?\n\n【7】### ANSWERS TO CASE 29:\n\n【8】#### Withholding Life Support\n\n【9】Summary : A young woman experiences a high cervical spinal cord injury and is quadriplegic and ventilator-dependent. She is extremely unlikely to ever regain motor independence or breathe without the ventilator. At the moment she is sedated for acute evaluation of her injuries, but we know of no reason she would lack decision-making capacity if she were awoken. Her husband and her parents state that she 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> would not want to be kept alive in such a state, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> would not want to be woken up to be informed of her situation or make decisions for herself.\n\n【10】 Can the patient’s family refuse LST? Although it is usually the case that surrogates can refuse LST on behalf of an incapacitated patient, there are 2 strong arguments against honoring their request to stop her ventilator. The first is that this patient only lacks decision-making capacity because she is being medically sedated. Because she is able to make decisions for herself (at least as far as the clinicians and family know), then generally speaking, she should be consulted about decisions that will have major and irreversible impact on her life. The second is an argument that decisions to withdraw LST in the first hours, days, or weeks after a high cervical cord injury should be postponed.\n\n【11】 If the patient were awake and refusing LST for herself, should her clinicians withhold LST? Many experts in neurology and rehabilitation medicine argue that decisions to forego LST after a high cervical cord injury resulting in quadriplegia should be postponed until 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> some time has passed to allow the acute emotional and psychological trauma of the event to subside somewhat, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> the patient has had a chance to learn more about what their quality of life will be like in his or her new debilitated state. This amounts to denying the request of a patient who meets our usual standards for competence, which cannot be done indefinitely without unacceptably infringing her right to self-determination. Most commentators on this issue recommend a period of 6 months or more in a rehabilitation program before clinicians honor a request to stop LST.\n\n【12】### ANALYSIS\n\n【13】##### Objectives\n\n【14】1\\. Recognize the settings in which decisions should be made by patients and distinguish from settings in which surrogate decision-making is appropriate.\n\n【15】2\\. Understand the arguments for and against honoring a request to forego LST in the acute time period after a high cervical cord injury.\n\n【16】##### Considerations\n\n【17】When approaching a difficult case one should try to identify the decision-making standards that should be used. Is this a case of a competent patient who should decide for herself? It would seem so in this case, but this requires recognizing that the sedated patient is capable of decision-making. If the patient has lost decision-making capacity, has she made any advance directives that apply to the situation? Has she designated someone as the best surrogate?\n\n【18】One must also identify the range of ethically permissible courses that could be pursued. If it would not be ethically permissible to withdraw LST, then this should not be an option offered to the patient or her surrogates. If the patient or her surrogates ask to pursue an ethically impermissible course, then clinicians can and should resist the temptation to simply acquiesce. Clinicians should ask for help in the form of ethics and, in some cases, legal consultations.\n\n【19】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【20】#### Withholding Life Support\n\n【21】### DEFINITIONS\n\n【22】COMPETENCE : This is used interchangeably with decision-making capacity to refer to a patient’s ability to make medical decisions for himself or herself.\n\n【23】LIFE-SUSTAINING THERAPY : This phrase is typically used to refer to mechanical ventilation and artificial hydration and nutrition. However, it can also be used to refer to any therapy that is currently needed to keep the patient alive (eg, pressors, antibiotics, dialysis).\n\n【24】SUBSTITUTED JUDGMENT : The standard of decision-making wherein surrogates attempt to make the decision that the patient would have made, based on the surrogate’s knowledge of the patient’s values, preferences, and decision-making style.\n\n【25】### CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【26】In a difficult case in which patients or surrogates are requesting to pursue a course of treatment that the clinicians think is ethically impermissible, it is usually best to continue talking rather than take an action that cannot be easily reversed. Obviously, in this case, removing the ventilator would very rapidly become irreversible. Alternatively, if the clinicians insist on continuing LST, and even on pursuing surgery for the spinal fracture, the patient will still have the option later to discontinue LST. Continuing LST and performing surgery over the objections of the patient or her surrogates could obviously be contentious and lead to conflict between the parties. Clinicians should anticipate this, by being prepared to patiently explain their actions, and by consulting with others who can help the patient and family understand why the usual practice of honoring the request of patients, surrogates, or both to forego LST is not being pursued. This might include social workers, patient–family relationship professionals, ethics consultants, and, if necessary, legal counsel.\n\n【27】### DISCUSSION\n\n【28】To decide on the most ethically defensible course of action in a difficult case, it is best to start by trying to identify the ethical principles at stake. By identifying the type of question we are facing, we make it much easier to identify the principles we should rely on when choosing a course of action. This also allows us to draw on experience from other cases sharing similar ethical features, and helps ensure that we reason consistently from case to case.\n\n【29】At first glance, this case appears to be a case of deciding for others, in which family members or surrogates who know the patient have to make medical decisions on the patient’s behalf. If it is a case of deciding for others, then perhaps all we have to do is to ensure that the surrogates are well informed and are exercising substituted judgment (trying to make the decision they think the patient would have made, based on knowledge of the patient’s premorbid values and preferences). If those conditions are met, and the family agrees that the patient would not want LST, perhaps the most appropriate course is to cease ventilator support and allow the patient to die, while also ensuring to palliate any pain or suffering that might occur as a result.\n\n【30】However, there are a number of problems with this approach. One very important problem is that the patient described here potentially has the cognitive capacity to make decisions for herself. As far as we can tell, the only reason she is unconscious right now is because she is being medically sedated. If she is only temporarily incapacitated, especially if we the clinicians are the ones incapacitating her, then we should not think of her as lacking decision-making capacity. If she can participate in important medical decisions, then generally speaking she ought participate in those discussions. This is all the more important when the decisions come with such stark and irreversible consequences.\n\n【31】Perhaps, then, the clinicians should wake up the patient and discuss LST with her? If she wanted to continue LST, then she would need the cervical fusion, but the main topic of discussion would be about whether she wants to continue living, knowing that she is very likely (though it’s not absolutely certain) to remain a ventilator-dependent quadriplegic. Assuming she has capacity, discussing LST with her certainly seems like an important way to respect her autonomy as an individual. But, first we need to consider some important arguments against waking her up and letting her decide. One is the family’s argument that waking her up and discussing the situation with her would be horribly traumatic to the patient, and could only result in the same decision. Another is a more general point about when medical providers should allow patients, or surrogates on their behalf, to refuse LST after a sudden traumatic and life-altering event such as traumatic high cervical quadriplegia.\n\n【32】In this case, the parents argue quite plausibly that, if the patient were to be awakened and learn of her situation, then she would be emotionally devastated. Furthermore, they say that they are absolutely certain that they know what her decision will be in the end. Regarding the decision to wake her up, they also claim that they know she would not want to be woken up to learn of her situation. So what purpose would be served by discussing it with her?\n\n【33】In a sense, they are arguing that the decision to wake her up is a decision that can only be made by her surrogates. And, because they know the patient best, they should be allowed to exercise substituted judgment on her behalf regarding the question of whether to wake her up. This may well strike some readers as a plausible and perhaps even a persuasive argument. Other readers will probably disagree, believing that surrogates should only be permitted to make decisions for patients when they are incapacitated by their injury or their disease. (Though perhaps such a reader would allow an exception when surrogates make decisions that can later be reversed. For example, one might say that it is permissible for the surrogates to consent to the fusion surgery on behalf of the patient rather than wake her up, because the surgery does not commit her to indefinite LST, but it would not be permissible for the surrogates to refuse LST, because this is obviously an irreversible decision.)\n\n【34】There are reasonable arguments on either side about what role the surrogates should play in making decisions for a patient like this one. So let us set this problem aside for a moment and consider the second problem: when, if ever, should we allow “competent” patients to refuse LST after a sudden and severely debilitating injury like traumatic high cervical quadriplegia? Imagine that the family consented to the cervical fusion. The surgery is performed without complication, and it is now 4 days after her fall. We wake her up. We manage (with some difficulty, of course) to establish reliable communication with her using communication boards with eye movements and lip-reading, and all are in agreement that she is fully awake and able to understand what is being said to her. Imagine that she is appropriately emotionally distraught, but able to pass any cognitive tests that anyone proposes, and she is able to understand her medical situation and prognosis, at least as it is conveyed to her by her care providers. Finally, imagine that she indicates that she wants the ventilator turned off. Should the attending physician immediately honor this patient’s competent refusal of LST?\n\n【35】Generally speaking, physicians ought to honor competent patients’ informed voluntary refusal of any therapies, even life-sustaining therapies. For many, however, this type of case is the exception that proves the rule. Many but not all clinicians and ethicists argue that patients who suddenly lose their physical capabilities should not be permitted to refuse LST until 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> a period of time has passed to allow the acute emotional upset to subside, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> the patient has enough experience with her new disability to consider her perspective to be informed.\n\n【36】This argument, it should be noted, is not an all-or-none argument. No mainstream ethicist would argue that competent and informed vent-dependent quadriplegics must be forced to continue living on a ventilator indefinitely . Rather, the argument is that some amount of time should pass, and some amount of information-exchange and learning should occur before a decision to discontinue LST. Most who take this position will recommend at least a few months before such a decision, and some argue that as long as 2 years are required before patients have sufficient emotional capacity and relevant information about life with their disability. It is well known that patients’ perception of quality of life gradually changes after a sudden disability, and it is also true that nondisabled persons systematically underestimate quality of life with disability when compared with disabled persons’ perceptions of their own quality of life.\n\n【37】There appears to be a tension between the principle of beneficence on one hand and the principle of respect for autonomy on the other. Beneficence suggests that patients should be kept alive for a time because at least some of them will come to view life as a quadriplegic as acceptable and worth living. Respect for autonomy suggests that competent informed patients should not be subjected to medical interventions that they refuse. Early on in such a case, the principle of beneficence has strong persuasive power—should we at least give her a little time to think about her situation before withdrawing support? Later on, the principle of respect for autonomy gains more and more force: “You can’t keep me on LST against my wishes forever.”\n\n【38】Whenever we draw a line (a few days, a few weeks, a few months, a few years), it will be arbitrary and will not fully resolve the tension between the principles. So now we see that there aren’t any clear lines we can draw that will ‘solve’ the case, but we can identify some guiding principles:\n\n【39】1\\. Potentially competent patients should be permitted to participate in important medical decisions for themselves, particularly when the decision being contemplated is irreversible and consequential.\n\n【40】2\\. Whenever possible in the immediate aftermath of a devastating injury, decisions to discontinue LST should only be made in a deliberate fashion, after the relevant parties have had time to adjust emotionally and learn more directly about what life will be like after the injury. Most ethicists and clinicians recommend a waiting period from a few months to a few years after a high cervical cord injury before discontinuing LST. Ideally, patients in this situation should be allowed to learn about rehabilitation, and should meet other survivors of high cervical quadriplegia.\n\n【41】Both principles strongly suggest that the clinicians in this case should not simply honor the request of the family to turn off the ventilator within the first few days of the injury. Withdrawal of LST should only be seriously contemplated after the patient can be consulted, and only after an adjustment and information-exchange period has passed.\n\n【42】These conclusions are not uncontroversial. Some readers may even disagree strongly. This is a perfect opportunity to point out the importance and utility of consultation with parties who might have differing perspectives on such a case. Ethics consultation services are particularly helpful. Legal counsel might reasonably be sought. Experts in rehabilitation can be very useful, as can psychiatrists and neurologists, social workers, therapists, and others. No matter what decision is reached, when the stakes are high and there are widely divergent opinions among the stakeholders, it is wise to be slow and deliberate, making use of wide consultation.\n\n【43】###",

Several observations can be made about the present case.\n\n【13】Antero-septal accessory pathways represent around 7% to 9% of all accessory pathways 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 – 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】ECG characteristics suggesting an antero-septal location of the accessory pathway include positive delta waves in leads II, III, aVF, and isoelectric/negative delta waves in V1.\n\n【15】RF ablation of antero-septal accessory pathways can be attempted using RF energy or, in order to minimize the risk of inadvertent AV block, with cryo energy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. Ablation of the accessory pathway should be attempted targeting its ventricular insertion 删除33：<u>通用删除1(英):<u>(as shown in Fig. 15.14 , right panel)</u></u>, since the fibrous tissue isolating the bundle of His protects the conduction tissue at this level from thermal injury; ablation should not target the atrial insertion of the accessory pathway, since this can be in close proximity to the compact AV node, and ablation attempts in this area can produce complete AV block.\n\n【16】Another ablation issue of antero-septal accessory pathway is catheter instability. A good contact between the ablation catheter and the accessory pathway is crucial in order to perform successful ablation and to avoid recurrences. Frequently, a stabilizing sheath is required in order to improve catheter stability in this region.\n\n【17】Using an electroanatomical mapping system to guide mapping and ablation of antero-septal pathways has the advantage of reducing the fluoroscopy time and dose throughout the procedure, and to allow assessment of proper catheter positioning at the optimal ablation site. Contact force evaluation before ablating the accessory pathway is also an advantage. It is our experience to titrate RF energy from 10 to 15 W and increase the target power up to 25 to 30 W in this region if conduction block at the level of the accessory pathway but not at the level of the normal conduction system is observed during the first 10 s of RF application. Up to date, there is no ablation index suggested value as a definite end-point for the ablation. The value that we use is 450. Additional “consolidating” RF lesions can be applied at the successful ablation site, in order to minimize the risk of recurrence, but always weighing the risk/benefit ratio for any extra lesion in this area.\n\n【18】Some authors have suggested and successfully performed RF ablation of antero-septal pathways from the non-coronary aortic cusp 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】Learning Point\n\n【20】   Catheter ablation of right antero-septal accessory pathways can be accomplished with a high success rate and a low complication rate.\n   When bidirectional conduction is present via the accessory pathway, performing 2 activation maps (that of the earliest atrial activation during V pacing/ORT and that of the earliest ventricular activation site during sinus rhythm/atrial pacing/ART) is very useful, since they provide information about both the atrial and the ventricular insertion site of the accessory pathway. Ablation should be done in between the atrial and the ventricular insertion site, to maximize the success rate.\n   If the AP is dangerously close to the His bundle, RF energy should be applied on the ventricular part of the annulus, in order to minimize the risk of inadvertent AV node injury (at a site where the amplitude of the local V electrogram >amplitude of the local A electrogram).\n   When ablating antero-septal accessory pathways, catheter stability is an issue. This can be improved by using a long deflectable sheath that confers a better contact between the catheter tip and the myocardium.",

        "text": "【0】Question: A mother brings her 6-month-old son to the pediatrician. She has noticed that he seems “afraid of light” and, after some Internet research, she is concerned that he might be an albino. Laboratory analysis reveals uroporphyrin in his urine. The child most likely has which of the following conditions?\n\n【1】> (A) Deficiency of coproporphyrinogen oxidase\n\n【2】> (B) Deficiency of porphobilinogen deaminase\n\n【3】> (C) Deficiency of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase\n\n【4】> (D) Inhibition of ferrochelatase and δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydrase\n\n【5】> (E) Overexpression of porphobilinogen deaminase\n\n【6】 Answer: The correct answer is C. This individual suffers from porphyria cutanea tarda. The porphyrias are diseases resulting from enzymatic deficiencies in heme biosynthesis, and porphyria cutanea tarda is the most common form. This disorder is caused by deficiency of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, the hepatic enzyme that catalyzes the formation of coproporphyrinogen III from uroporphyrinogen III. Lack of this enzyme results in uroporphyrin accumulation in the urine (giving the urine a tea-colored appearance) and uroporphyrinogen accumulation systemically. This compound absorbs light and releases heat, causing extreme photosensitivity.  \nAnswer A is incorrect. Hereditary coproporphyria is a disease due to the deficiency of coproporphyrinogen oxidase, the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of protoporphyrinogen from coproporphyrinogen III. Coproporphyrinogen III accumulates in the urine. Patients with this condition tend to be photosensitive.  \nAnswer B is incorrect. Acute intermittent porphyria is caused by a deficiency in porphobilinogen deaminase (also called uroporphyrinogen 1 synthetase), the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of pre-uroporphyrinogen from porphobilinogen. Lack of this enzyme causes porphobilinogen and δ-aminolevulinic acid to accumulate in the urine. Patients with acute intermittent porphyria are not photosensitive, but they do experience symptoms of painful abdomen, polyneuropathy, and psychological disturbances. They also have pink coloration of their urine.  \nAnswer D is incorrect. Ferrochelatase and δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) dehydrase are sensitive to inhibition by lead. Thus, lead poisoning leads to an accumulation of coproporphyrin and ALA in the urine. Lead poisoning is a problem seen in children who live in old houses with chipped paint 删除10：<u>(lead was used in paint manufacturing until the 1970s)</u>. Ingestion of large quantities of lead can cause lines on the gingiva and epiphyses of long bones, encephalopathy, erythrocyte basophilic stippling, abdominal colic, sideroblastic anemia, and neuropathy leading to foot and wrist drops. It is not associated with photosensitivity. The first line of treatment is dimercaprol and EDTA to bind up the free lead in the serum.  \nAnswer E is incorrect. Porphobilinogen deaminase deficiency, not excess, results in acute intermittent porphyria. One would expect to find δ-aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen in the urine and no photosensitivity.",

Thus， this patient is anticipated to pose lit-tle or no difficulty with airway management and his airway is classed as Mallampati Class 1.

In addition to the typical presurgical“work up，”an anesthetic evaluation is also important prior to the administration of anesthesia-whether general， regional anesthesia， or monitored anesthesia care (local infiltration with monitoring and sedation by an anesthesia provider). The pre-anesthesia evaluation addresses factors such as the patient's NPO status， the presence or absence of gastric reflux， his or her response to previous anesthetics， a reconciliation of medications taken on the day of surgery， and any pertinent family history including direct queries regarding malignant hyperthermia\n\n| Table 10-4 PHASES AND STAGES OF ANESTHESIA  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| PHASES OF ANESTHESIA  | STAGES OF ANESTHESIA  |\n| Induction  | Analgesia.

In addition to the routine history and physi-cal， this information is necessary to allow the formulation of a safe and effective anesthetic plan. (Please also see the chapter on preoperative evaluation).\n\n【42】Additional items on the physical examination include a careful evaluation of the patient's airway anatomy and neck mobility， and the ease of i.v. access. In particular， the airway examination， including the “fingers breadth” of mouth opening， hyomental distance， and Mallampati classification， provide informa-tion regarding the potential difficulty or ease of intubation. The patient’s NPO status， and presence or absence of gastric reflux or of a syndrome that signifi-cantly increases gastric volume may signal the need for a rapid sequence induc-tion 删除25：<u>(Please see Case 11)</u>， and similarly influences the anesthetic plan.\n\n【43】The anesthetic plan should allow for a rapid return of mental function， and especially in the case of outpatients， recovery of psychomotor skills prior to . discharge， as well as to minimize complications. Patients must be able to walk(if they could walk prior to the procedure)， be medically stable， and free of pain， and nausea or vomiting prior to discharge from the hospital.\n\n【44】The temporal progression of an anesthetic can be separated into several phases： the beginning is typically referred to as induction， the middle， as main-tenance， and the end， emergence. The depth of anesthesia， or progression to and from unconsciousness， is referred to as the stages of anesthesia. 删除25：<u>通用删除1(英):<u>(Please see Table 10-4)</u></u>. Stage I lasts from full consciousness until a patient closes his eyes. Stage II begins when the patient closes his eyes. It is characterized by a hyper-excitability to external stimuli which may include vocalization and movement， the loss of protective airway reflexes， and autonomic instability. Stage II ends when patients regain autonomic stability. It is during this stage that patients are most vulnerable. Stage III is the stage of surgical anesthesia. It is divided into four planes； planes 3 and 4 are optimal for surgery.\n\n【45】Prior to the induction of anesthesia， monitors are placed including a blood pressure cuff， an electrocardiogram， a pulse oximeter， a capnograph (which monitors end-tidal CO， detecting any deficit in ventilation or metabolism or elimination of CO，)， and an oxygen analyzer in the breathing circuit (which confirms the continuous flow of oxygen).\n\n【46】Anesthesia is most frequently induced using an intravenous anesthetic such as propofol， etomidate， or sodium thiopental. Patients perceive intravenous anesthetics as a pleasant way to go to sleep， and these agents rapidly render the patient into Stage III of anesthesia， quickly traversing the troublesome Stage II.\n\n【47】Once anesthesia is induced and patients enter Stages II or III， the oral and pharyngeal muscles lose tone and the patient’s airway often begins to obstruct. The airway can be managed by tilting the head back and moving the jaw for-ward at the angle of the mandible until the airway is patent.

Induction can also be accomplished with inhalational anesthetics， and with the newer agents， can be quite pleasant. However， patients do not traverse Stage II as rapidly， and are thus vulnerable to aspira-tion and difficult airway management for that short period of time.\n删除4：<u>Table 10-5 INDICATIONS FOR TRACHEAL INTUBATION</u>\n\n【48】·Airway access\n\n【49】·Airway protection\n\n【50】· Need for muscle relaxation (paralysis)\n\n【51】·Length of procedure (>2 hours)\n\n【52】·Need for mechanical ventilation\n\n【53】Anesthesia is typically maintained with an inhalation agent such as desflu-rane or sevoflurane， or with an intravenous infusion of propofol. Oxygen and inhalation anesthetics are administered with a mask or through airway device such as a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) or an endotracheal tube. It should be noted that after a period of 2 hours， pressure on nerves from a mask may cause nerve palsies involving small branches of the facial nerves， particularly in the peri-oral region， potentially yielding hyperesthesia or analgesia on the face. The laryngeal mask airway can similarly cause pressure on the recurrent laryn-geal nerves， leading to (usually transient) vocal cord paralysis.\n\n【54】Unlike a mask or laryngeal mask airway， the placement of an endotracheal tube usually requires paralyzing a patient with a neuromuscular blocker. Since paralysis removes the patient’s ability to breathe， and ssince intubation requires the mechanical instrumentation of the pharynx and trachea (which can lead to complications)， intubation is only performed when there is an indication. 删除25：<u>通用删除1(英):<u>(Please see Table 10-5.)</u></u>\n\n【55】The maintenance of anesthesia is often supplemented with an opiate to reduce pain during and after surgery. This in turn facilitates a reduction in the amount of anesthetic that is required. This patient， for example， would receive desflurane as the inhalation agent， O2， and a small amount of fentanyl added near the end of the procedure to minimize postoperative pain.\n\n【56】As wound closure begins， the anesthetic agent is discontinued. Emergence begins， and the patient is allowed to awaken. He traverses the stages of anesthesia in reverse order， including Stage II. In fact， Stage II is more likely to be observed at emergence than induction， because at induction， patients receive an intravenous induction agent and pass rapidly (and almost imperceptibly) through Stage II.\n\n【57】CLINICAL SUMMARY\n\n【58】This healthy man undergoing an arthroscopy will be monitored with a blood pressure cuff， electrocardiogram， pulse oximeter， end-tidal CO， monitLOr(capnograph)， and a circuit oxygen analyzer. His anesthetic will be induced with propofol， a laryngeal mask placed， and his anesthetic maintained with desflurane including a small amount of opiate at the end of the case. Once he awakens and can respond to commands (meaning that he has successfully tra-versed Stage II)， the laryngeal mask will be removed.",

Approximately 60% of term and 80% of preterm babies develop jaundice in the first week of life， and about 10% of breastfed babies are still jaundiced at 1 month of age通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>. In most babies early jaundice is usually harmless (often termed 'physiological jaundice'). However， a few babies will develop severe jaundice and its complications including bilirubin encephalopathy(kernicterus) if untreated. Box 36.1 lists factors that indicate pathological jaundice in infants.\n\n【28】Early onset of clinical jaundice in the first 24 hours of age Rapid rise of serum bilirubin >100 micromol/I/24h Sick newborn with jaundice Serum bilirubin >250 umol/l by 48 h of age or >300 pmol/I by 72 h of age Failure to respond to phototherapy Prolonged jaundice - >14 d in term infants and >21d in preterm infants Conjugated bilirubin level of >35 umol/I ● Pale chalky stools and dark urine Box 36.1： Indicators of pathological jaundice in newborn infants\n\n【29】The baby in this scenario has prolonged jaundice. Prolonged jaundice is defined as jaundice persisting beyond the first 14 days in term infants and 21 days in preterm infants. Screening investigations for prolonged jaundice are listed in (Box 36.2).\n\n| Conjugated and total serum bilirubin Full blood count and blood film (features of haemolysis) Blood group and direct antiglobulin test Thyroid function tests Urine microscopy and culture Urine for reducing substances Liver function tests  |\n| --- |\n\n【31】Box 36.2： Screening investigations for prolonged jaundice in neonates\n\n【32】It is important to differentiate between conjugated and unconjugated jaundice as the underlying diagnosis for each will be different. Understanding the physiology of bilirubin production will help you understand the potential causes of both conjugated and unconjugated jaundice. Bilirubin is mainly produced from the breakdown of red blood cells. Red cell breakdown produces unconjugated bilirubin， which circulates mostly bound to albumin although some is ‘free' and hence able to enter the brain. Unconjugated bilirubin is metabolised in the liver to produce conjugated bilirubin which then passes into the gut and is largely excreted in stool， with a smaller amount being re-absorbed in the enterohepatic circulation.\n\n【33】This baby has unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia. NICE guidelines provide recommendations for the investigation and management of jaundice in babies， (box 36.3) with this baby needing to have thyroid function tests， urine microscopy， urine culture and urine reducing substances to complete the initial prolonged jaundice screen. The clinical history tells you that the newborn screening blood spot has been performed and therefore the babies TSH level will have been assessed at that point. Whilst TFTs are still indicated the diagnosis of hypothyroidism is unlikely. Urinary tract infections are a relatively common cause of prolonged jaundice and therefore microscopy and culture is indicated. Reducing substances should also be tested for， but a metabolic diagnosis is much less likely than a Urinary tract infection (UTI).\n\n【34】● Haemolysis due to Rhesus， ABO or other isoimmunisation， heriditary spherocytosis and other red cell morphological abnormalities， Enzyme deficiency (G6PD， pyruvate kinase)\n\n【35】Breast milk jaundice\n\n【36】Infections including UTI\n\n【37】Endocrine conditions e.g. hypothyroidism， hypopituitarism\n\n【38】Metabolic causes e.g. glucuronyl transferase deficiency， galactosaemia\n\n【39】Box 36.3： Common causes of prolonged unconjugated jaundice\n\n【40】Breastfed babies are more likely than formula-fed babies to develop jaundice， both within the first week of life as well as beyond 2 to 3 weeks of age. Early jaundice in breastfed babies is thought to be due to a combination of factors， such as dehydration， poor gut motility， failure to pass meconium - all of which tend to cause increased enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin. These factors in isolation or in combination may also have a role in “breast milk\" jaundice later.\n\n【41】Breast milk jaundice presenting as prolonged jaundice is seen in well babies who are thriving， have normal clinical examination apart from clinical jaundice and there is no evidence of haemolysis or infection. Parents should be reassured and breastfeeding continued. Pregnanediol metabolite or esterified fatty acids in breast milk may have inhibitory effect on hepatic conjugation through UGT enzymes. Alternatively， this may increase β-glucuronidase activity and deconjugate bilirubin， increase enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin and increase hepatic bilirubin load. These plausible mechanisms still remain unproven.\n\n【42】Jaundice from other causes may have to be ruled out， including blood group incompatibility (most commonly Rhesus or ABO incompatibility)， other causes of haemolysis (breaking down of red blood cells)， sepsis (infection)， liver disease， bruising and metabolic disorders. Deficiency of a particular enzyme，glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase， can cause severe neonatal jaundice. Glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase deficiency is more common in certain geographical/ethnic group (eg Mediterannean and African).\n\n【43】Prolonged conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia is less common. The main causes are listed in box 36.4. An important diagnosis to make in these babies is biliary atresia as the outcome is much better if this condition can be operated on before 8 weeks of age. Abdominal US scan and radioisotope scan (HIDA) are undertaken to confirm this diagnosis prior to referral to one of the specialist liver services in the UK.\n\n【44】● Intrauterine infections - TORCH\n\n| ●  | Intrauterine infections - TORCH  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ●  | Neonatal hepatitis  |\n|  | Biliary atresia  |\n|  | Choledochal cyst  |\n|  | Parenteral nutrition related  |\n|  | Metabolic e.g. cystic fibrosis， al-antitrypsin deficiency， galactosaemia  |\n| ●  | Intrahepatic cholestasis -syndromic and familial  |\n\n【46】● Intrahepatic cholestasis -syndromic and familial\n\n【47】Box 36.4： Common causes of prolonged conjugated jaundice\n删除16：<u>Syllabus Mapping\n\n【48】Neonatology\nBe able to recognise and initiate the management of common disorders in the newborn including sepsis 删除换行5 Understand the causes and features of neonatal jaundice knowing when to refer for further investigation and be able to recognise early presentation of neonatal hepatitis and biliary atresia\n\n【49】</u>",

        "text": "【0】### 8 Maternal–fetal conflicts: Cesarean delivery on maternal request\n\n【1】Ruth Landau and Steve Yentis\n\n【2】#### The Case\n\n【3】> Jane and Jim, successful lawyers in their mid-forties, are expecting their first child. Immediately after they learned that their 4th in-vitro fertilization attempt was successful, they decided to request a Cesarean delivery. At 36 weeks, Jane and Jim confirm again their desire to have a ‘maternal request’ Cesarean section and ask for the Cesarean delivery to be performed the following week at 37 weeks’ gestation to accommodate Jim’s busy agenda. In addition, Jane is adamant she wants to have a general anesthetic due to her fear of experiencing any kind of discomfort or pain during the Cesarean section .\n\n【4】Until recently, debate around the indications for and choice of Cesarean section have focused on rights of women to refuse a Cesarean section when urgent delivery is medically indicated. In terms of the “principlism” (four principles) approach to ethical analysis, this debate has highlighted the balance between the obligations of the obstetrician to both the mother and fetus and obligations of the mother to the fetus, based on beneficence and non-maleficence , and the duty to respect the mother’s autonomy . Legally, many courts recognize an absolute right of women with capacity to refuse medical treatment even when that decision may result in their death or the death of their baby. Doctors have duties to respect a woman’s autonomy and obligations to inform fully, counsel honestly, and avoid coercion.\n\n【5】Recently, a new phenomenon has emerged in which patients demand a cesarean section. More women are switching their birth plan from a “natural childbirth/no epidural” perspective towards a more “controlled”, medicalized or surgical childbirth. What ethical implications does this growing phenomenon have for clinicians?\n\n【6】##### Cesarean section upon maternal request\n\n【7】Cesarean section rates are rising in developed countries. Reasons include a decline in vaginal births after previous Cesarean delivery, a decline in vaginal breech deliveries, and a reluctance among many obstetricians to “risk” a vaginal delivery when labor is not straightforward. The number of Cesarean deliveries at maternal request (CDMR) – i.e. in the absence of any medical or obstetrical indications – has been increasing, accounting for 48–18% of all Cesarean deliveries.通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>1 </sup></u> An independent panel of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the Office of Medical Applications of Research of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) reviewed CDMR in 2006 <sup>2 </sup> and drew the following conclusions.\n\n【8】通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> The incidence of cesarean delivery without medical or obstetrical indications is increasing in the US, one component of which is CDMR.\n\n【9】通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> There is insufficient evidence to fully evaluate the benefits and risks of CDMR compared to planned vaginal delivery. More research is needed.\n\n【10】通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> Until evidence becomes available, the decision to perform CDMR should be individualized and consistent with ethical principles.\n\n【11】通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> The risks of placenta previa and accreta rise with each Cesarean delivery, and CDMR is not recommended for women desiring several children.\n\n【12】通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> CDMR should not be performed before 39 weeks’ gestation or without verification of lung maturity because of the significant danger of neonatal respiratory complications.\n\n【13】通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u> Unavailability of effective labor pain options should not influence the decision to perform CDMR.\n\n【14】Ethical considerations for CDMR go beyond the principles of respect for autonomy and beneficence / non-maleficence . They include issues of resource allocation and the impact of CDMR on healthcare costs (i.e. the principle of justice ) as well as idealistic and philosophical reflections on future societal implications if Cesarean deliveries become the norm.\n\n【15】##### CDMR from the mother’s perspective\n\n【16】Common reasons reported by women requesting a cesarean delivery are fear of labor pain and stress; uncertainty of outcome; fear of emergency intervention such as forceps; fear of fetal distress during labor; fear of future sexual dysfunction, stress incontinence or pelvic prolapse; and convenience. Ultimately, women may invoke a right to have their autonomy respected, and to participate in all decisions related to their healthcare; in other words, if an informed woman wants a cesarean delivery, she should have the right to request a cesarean delivery regardless of any medical risk that her decision may inflict on her or her baby.\n\n【17】Respect for patient autonomy requires that a patient be fully informed about the benefits and the risks of a recommended treatment, and then has the right either to consent to the treatment or refuse it. But broadening this principle to create an obligation to respect a patient request for treatment that is not recommended and might even be harmful stretches the concept of patient autonomy to a point that many ethicists and lawyers believe goes beyond what is reasonably acceptable within the usual doctor–patient relationship. In the UK, non-obstetrical patient treatment requests have been tested in the courts, which have confirmed that doctors are not legally or ethically obliged to provide treatment requested by a patient if they consider it not in his/her best interests.\nWith CDMR, the situation is further complicated by the involvement of a third party – the fetus. A woman may desire CDMR to avoid a complicated vaginal delivery that may be harmful not only to herself but also to her baby. Furthermore, the risk of a primigravidae requiring an urgent unplanned cesarean delivery during labor are significant – approximately 10%–20%. Cesarean section following a prolonged trial of labor involves higher maternal morbidity than a scheduled Cesarean, due to increased risk of uterine atony and hemorrhage. For the baby, a scheduled Cesarean delivery may reduce risks, such as reduced availability of neonatal resuscitative measures, associated with a possible “out of office hours” delivery. Indeed, concern for the baby is one of the most common motivations cited by women requesting CDMR.\nAutonomy of decision-making implies that the benefits and risks are known, disclosed and discussed. In the case of CDMR, this may not be entirely possible. Evidence on the risks and benefits of CDMR in low risk pregnant women has never been entirely assessed, leading the NIH to call for more randomized clinical trials.\n\n【18】##### CDMR from the fetus’s perspective\n\n【19】The concept of “fetal rights” contributes to a notion that the pregnant woman and her fetus are potential adversaries. Much of the debate around “fetal rights” has been in the context of abortion, an area of great political, ethical, and legal controversy. The fetus is in an intermediate ethical, and legal position. Lacking capacity, it cannot have autonomy. Furthermore, the fetus is dependent for its well-being on the choices made by the mother. In UK and Canadian common law “the fetus does not have legal rights until it is born alive and with complete delivery from the body of the pregnant woman.”通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>5 </sup></u> If a competent woman refuses medical advice, her decision must be respected even if the doctor believes that her fetus will suffer as a result. According to the ACOG Committee on Ethics通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>6 </sup></u> :\n\n【20】> Pregnant women’s autonomous decisions should be respected. Concerns about the impact of maternal decisions on fetal well-being should be discussed in the context of medical evidence and understood within the context of each woman’s broad social network, cultural beliefs, and values. In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, circumstances that, in fact, the Committee on Ethics cannot currently imagine, judicial authority should not be used to implement treatment regimens aimed at protecting the fetus, for such actions violate the pregnant woman’s autonomy .\n\n【21】Regarding CDMR, the fetus’s best interests are usually considered in terms of the risks of prematurity and trauma if delivered by elective cesarean section, weighed against the risks of injury arising from difficult delivery, emergency intervention, or post-maturity.\n\n【22】In the case of Jane and Jim, CDMR is particularly controversial because they request it at 37 weeks’ gestation. Compelling evidence concludes that neonatal outcomes are improved if Cesarean delivery is delayed until 39 weeks.通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>7 </sup></u> The risks should clearly be presented to Jane and Jim as well as the option to perform fetal lung tests prior to scheduling the surgery.\n\n【23】##### CDMR from the doctor’s perspective\n\n【24】###### Do doctors have the choice whether or not to perform a CDMR ?\n\n【25】Principles of beneficence and nonmaleficence are particularly challenging with CDMR, since they must balance benefits and harms for both mother and baby in a situation where 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> there is a lack of reliable authoritative data, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> physicians’ own personal views may vary widely, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> there is heated political as well as medical debate.\n\n【26】The most compelling arguments against performing an elective Cesarean section relate to complications. To reduce fetal morbidity, CDMR should at least not be performed before fetal lung maturation has been established, and therefore should not be scheduled before 39 weeks’ gestation. Data regarding maternal morbidity are generally based on nonscheduled procedures in women with medical and obstetrical conditions that both increase risks and may require general rather than regional anesthesia. Data for maternal morbidity following scheduled procedures are few. In addition, maternal risks are known to increase with successive Cesarean sections. From a nonmaleficence perspective, therefore, CDMR risks to future pregnancies must be thoroughly examined and discussed.\n\n【27】Should obstetricians ever be compelled to provide a Cesarean delivery they do not believe to be medically necessary? Most doctors believe that professional autonomy protects them from providing such therapy, and ensures their “clinical freedom.” There are cases (e.g. abortion) in which doctors are excused from obligations to provide treatment to which they have a moral or religious objection. Obstetricians might argue it is against their moral integrity to perform a nonindicated surgical procedure such as a CDMR. However, as reinforced in the UK by the Burke ruling,通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>8 </sup></u> a much stronger argument may be one based on risks and benefits and the interests of the patient(s), rather than one based on physicians’ personal morals. In the UK, National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines suggest that doctors have the right to “decline a request for a caesarean section in the absence of an identifiable reason.”\n###### What do obstetricians believe?\n\n【28】Surveys show disagreement among obstetricians regarding CDMR, and that a significant proportion of obstetricians would either choose CDMR for themselves or their partners and/or would comply with women’s requests. Their reasons include fears of complications of vaginal delivery, desires to avoid medicolegal consequences if such complications develop after refusing to perform CDMR, and desires to respect women’s autonomy. In a survey involving eight European countries and over 1500 obstetricians, wide differences in culture and case law appeared to account for variation in compliance with a woman’s request for CDMR, which ranged from 15% (Spain) to 79% (UK).通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>10 </sup></u> A survey of ACOG members found that of 699 respondents, just over half believed that women had the right to CDMR and a similar proportion had complied with such a request.",

After thorough imaging studies and histopathologic confirmation of Wilms tumor, the physician prescribes a medication that acts by causing arrest of the cell cycle during metaphase. However, the parents are concerned about the use of that medication because of what they have read about its adverse effects. Which adverse effect are the parents most likely concerned about?\n\n【1】> (A) Cardiotoxicity\n\n【2】> (B) Hemorrhagic cystitis\n\n【3】> (C) Hyperglycemia\n\n【4】> (D) Pulmonary fibrosis\n\n【5】> (E) Neurotoxicity\n\n【6】 Answer: The correct answer is E. The patient has a Wilms tumor, a childhood nephroblastoma that can be treated with the MOPP regimen, which includes the plant alkaloid vincristine (Oncovin). Vincristine halts cell division by inhibiting microtubule polymerization, thus preventing formation of the mitotic spindle and causing metaphase arrest. It has the adverse effect of neurotoxicity as manifested by areflexia, peripheral neuritis, muscle weakness, and paralytic ileus. The MOPP regimen refers to the chemotherapeutic agents M echlorethamine, O ncovin, P rocarbazine, and P rednisone.  \nAnswer A is incorrect . Cardiotoxicity is most often associated with the use of anthracycline antibiotics such as doxorubicin and daunorubicin. It is thought that these medications can cause toxic levels of free radicals to build up in the myocardium, leading to muscle damage, decreased left ventricular ejection fraction, and symptoms of congestive heart failure.  \nAnswer B is incorrect . Hemorrhagic cystitis is an adverse reaction seen with the use of cyclophosphamide, an alkylating agent used to treat solid tumors and lymphoma. It is also used as an immunosuppressant to treat severe rheumatologic disorders.  \nAnswer C is incorrect . Hyperglycemia is a common adverse effect of prednisone and other steroid drugs. Vincristine, however, does not cause hyperglycemia. Prednisone is part of the MOPP regimen. Its mechanism of action is unclear, but is thought to relate to triggering apoptosis.  \nAnswer D is incorrect . Pulmonary fibrosis is seen with several chemotherapeutic agents including busulfan, which is used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia, and bleomycin, which is used to treat testicular cancer and lymphoma.",

        "text": "【0】### Treatment Planning\n\n【1】This section provides a sample of ways that therapists teach clients about the concepts of faulty cognitive maps and maladaptive schemas; help them evaluate beliefs by examining empirical evidence, effect on mood, degree of rationality, or impact on achieving goals; and promote positive cognitive change.\n\n【2】#### Explanations and Teaching\n\n【3】A commonly used method provides an ABC model for teaching clients the role of cognitions in determining their emotional reactions. The therapist begins by explaining that we usually operate on the assumption that events or people make us feel a certain way: “I got depressed because he didn’t call.” “She makes me mad when she asks where I’m going.” “He told me I had to work on the weekend, so I snapped.” This cause-effect assumption can be drawn with the letters A and C:\n\n【4】Then the therapist can explain why this is not so: The same event can cause different feelings. There is something that intervenes between A and C, and that is what you think (B):\n\n【5】Once this ABC model is understood, clients become collaborators in searching for the thoughts that cause their feelings. They learn that (a) it is their own thinking that is creating pain and frustration, and (b) they have control over their thinking and therefore can choose to think differently.\n\n【6】#### Therapeutic Conversations\n\n【7】Cognitive maps will be changed in the course of any type of therapeutic conversation. Sometimes the conversation is a philosophical discussion of the client’s view of the world and an evaluation of its tenets in terms of truth, morality, expediency, and other values. Narrative therapists encourage clients to tell stories about their lives and use techniques such as externalizing or reauthoring conversations to encourage the client to create an alternative view.\n\n【8】An example of three different reactions to the same event will illustrate the power of thinking. For instance, here is how three people reacted to a rejection letter from a graduate school:\n\n【9】1.  Person 1 became severely depressed; she interpreted the letter as catastrophic proof of her worthlessness. She decided she was not smart enough for graduate school and found a job that she never liked.\n2.  Person 2 felt relief and elation; the rejection letter meant that he was free to pursue what he loves instead of pleasing his parents. He enrolled in art school.\n3.  Person 3 became more motivated and determined; she interpreted the rejection as an unfortunate but impersonal event and understood it as a reasonable outcome, given the high number of applicants for few positions. She decided to improve her GRE scores and apply again, this time to more schools.\n\n【10】Therapists can tell stories of their own lives and struggles, talking about their own schemas and how they were changed through experiences and choices. After listening to the client’s stories, the therapist can offer a hunch about a possible schema: You seem to have the expectation that this problem can be solved without your having to expend any effort. The wording and tone of voice show that the therapist is tentative, awaiting the client’s agreement or disagreement. Therapists need to be sensitive to the client’s feelings and careful not to shame clients by implying that they were stupid to have such faulty beliefs. By connecting schemas to prior life experiences, you can help people understand that their schemas make sense, they just have to be updated.\n\n【11】#### Persuasion and Direct Influence\n\n【12】Therapists also teach clients about the cognitive concept of “rights” and about how beliefs about the rights of the self and others contribute to either unassertiveness or aggressiveness instead of an appropriate level of assertiveness. Lange and Jakubowski 通用删除7(英):<u>(1978)</u> illustrate how socialization messages that are more commonly given to girls than boys can limit their sense of personal rights:\n\n【13】   I have no right to place my needs above those of other people.\n   I have no right to do anything that would imply that I am better than other people.\n   I have no right to feel angry or to express my anger.\n   I have no right to make requests of other people.\n   I have no right to do anything that might hurt someone else’s feelings.\n\n【14】Here are some examples of rights that empower people to speak up and express their thoughts and feelings, ask for what they want, and say no to what they do not want:\n\n【15】   I have the right to assert my needs because they are as important as those of other people.\n   I have a right to show my abilities, enjoy my accomplishments, and take pride in myself.\n   I have a right to my angry feelings, and I have a right to express them appropriately at the time they occur so they won’t build up and explode.\n   If my rights are violated, I have the right to make demands for change.\n   I have the right to express my thoughts and feelings, even if occasionally someone’s feelings get hurt, as long as I am not deliberately trying to inflict hurt.\n\n【16】#### Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy\n\n【17】Training in CBT will give tools for working with faulty cognitive maps and will build competence in cognitive formulations. The approach of CBT is to use an agenda, a didactic approach, and structured activities. However, an exclusive reliance on CBT will limit your treatment options. Reinecke and Freeman 通用删除7(英):<u>(2003)</u> make the point that:\n\n【18】Any intervention or technique that alters a patient’s perceptions or beliefs might be viewed as cognitive. The number of techniques that are potentially available is virtually infinite. The effective cognitive therapist is able to provide patients with experiences in a creative, flexible manner that will refute their maladaptive beliefs. \n\n【19】#### Create a Collaborative Relationship\n\n【20】In Aaron Beck’s language, you are engaging in “collaborative empiricism,” teaching the client to function as a “personal scientist” by testing beliefs against empirical reality. Instead of taking the attitude that you have to change the client, assume that an adult of normal intelligence will want to make changes when he discovers that his own patterns of thinking are creating and maintaining problems.\n\n【21】#### Downward Arrow Technique\n\n【22】By repeating the same questions (And that means? And then? And next?), a series of responses leads the client from the original thought to deeper schemas and core beliefs. By drawing a downward arrow on paper as you write each successive response, you are showing that the movement is toward a deeper, fundamental level. For example, when the client identifies a negative thought that leads to anxiety about performance, good questions to ask are If that thought were true, why would it be upsetting ? Or What would that mean to you ? A client will move from I might make a mistake to My colleagues will think I’m stupid to They will know that I don’t deserve this job to That would mean I’m worthless.\n\n【23】When the questions do not produce a “deeper” response, then the core belief has been identified and the therapist can move on to challenging that belief. Once this technique has been demonstrated in a session with the therapist, the client is able to use it as a homework assignment.\n\n【24】#### Cost-Benefit Analysis\n\n【25】Instead of addressing whether a core belief is rational or true, the cost-benefit analysis engages the client in an examination of whether it is useful to continue to maintain that belief. The belief is written down, and then under it are drawn two columns, one for advantages or reasons for maintaining and the other for disadvantages or reasons for changing. Then, when the two lists are finished, the client divides 100 points between the two columns to indicate the relative weight given to each argument.\n\n【26】Clum 通用删除7(英):<u>(1990)</u> provides an example of the downward arrow technique with a person who has a fear of driving on the interstate highway.\n\n【27】#### Identifying the Underlying Belief\n\n【28】1.  Therapist: What will happen?\n2.  Client: I will have a panic attack.\n3.  Therapist: What will happen next?\n4.  Client: I will have to pull off the road.\n5.  Therapist: And next?\n6.  Client: I will be there forever.\n\n【29】#### Challenging the Belief\n\n【30】1.  Therapist: How likely is it that you will be there forever?\n2.  Client: Of course I wouldn’t be there forever. Either my panic attack would subside and I’d drive off, or someone would come to help me. Panic attacks always end, so I’ll be able to drive away. And the police always stop to help cars stopped alongside the road.\n\n【31】Burns 通用删除7(英):<u>(2005)</u> provided an example of a cost-benefit analysis for the belief “I need everyone’s approval to be worthwhile.”\n\n【32】#### Advantages\n\n【33】I’ll work hard to get people to approve of me; I’ll respect other people and pay careful attention to what they say and how they feel; I’ll sell lots of life insurance and make lots of money; I’ll be a people person and have lots and lots of friends. I’ll feel great when people do approve of me.\n\n【34】#### Disadvantages\n\n【35】Other people will control my self-esteem; I’ll get upset when people criticize me; I may try too hard and turn people off; I may not know what I believe in or stand for; my emotions will go up and down like a roller coaster depending on whether people like me.\n\n【36】In the example, the client gave 30 points to the advantages and 70 to the disadvantages.\n\n【37】#### Focus on Changing Behaviors\n\n【38】Behavior change can precede schema change. To change poor self-esteem, the person needs data that he or she is behaving in a way worthy of esteem; people create self-efficacy beliefs by experiencing mastery at challenging tasks. The Skill Deficits (BL3) hypothesis can be integrated: As people become more competent and effective, they will develop positive beliefs about themselves, as well as achieve positive appraisals from others, which also contribute to confidence and optimism.\n\n【39】If the cognitive map creates fear by labeling many situations as “threatening and dangerous,” it can be beneficial to help the person engage in risky behaviors, doing what is difficult, in spite of fear. Then when the client masters those situations, the cognitive map will change and the situations will no longer be labeled dangerous. For instance, Albert Ellis gave this assignment to a client who had catastrophic beliefs about the consequences of appearing silly in public: Take the New York subway and as you approach each station, shout out the name of the stop.",

        "text": "【0】Question: 26.1 A 27-year-old man has been rushed to the emergency department following his sudden collapse and entry into a state of unconsciousness. Examination of personal belongings revealed the patient is an insulin-dependent diabetic. A rapid decline in which of the following humoral factors likely triggered the sudden collapse of the patient?\n\n【1】A. Insulin\n\n【2】B. Glucagon\n\n【3】C. Fatty acids\n\n【4】D. Glucose\n\n【5】E. Triglyceride\n\n【6】Answer: 26.1 D . Glucose is the primary source of energy for the central nervous system. A sudden decrease in circulating glucose levels will therefore impair ATP generation, in turn impeding cognitive function. If hypoglycemia persists, then the patient will slip into a coma and eventually die. This unfortunately common complication in people with type 1 diabetes is a consequence of oversupplementation with insulin. By contrast, a sudden decrease in circulating insulin, glucagon, fatty acids, or triglyceride would have little immediate effect on cognitive function.\n\n【7】Question: 26.2 Which of the following is the least likely to contribute to the hyperglycemia associated with uncontrolled type 1 diabetes?\n\n【8】A. Decreased skeletal muscle glucose uptake\n\n【9】B. Decreased adipose lipogenesis\n\n【10】C. Increased adipose lipolysis\n\n【11】D. Increased hepatic gluconeogenesis\n\n【12】E. Increased skeletal muscle glycogenolysis\n\n【13】Answer: 26.2 E . Unlike the liver, skeletal muscle cannot export glucose into the circulation. Once glucose enters the myocyte, it is destined for use by that cell. Thus, intramyocellular glycogen is used as a fuel source by skeletal muscle and therefore cannot contribute to the hyperglycemia observed in uncontrolled type I diabetes. In contrast decreased insulin-mediated glucose utilization by skeletal muscle and adipose will contribute to hyperglycemia, as will decreased insulin-mediated suppression of hepatic glucose output. Decreased insulin-mediated suppression of lipolysis will indirectly contribute to hyperglycemia, by providing alterative, nonglucose fuels (fatty acids and ketone bodies) for organs such as skeletal muscle and the liver.\n\n【14】Question: 26.3 Which of the following changes in hepatic metabolism best explains the increased incidence of ketoacidosis observed in type 1 diabetes?\n\n【15】A. Increased glucose uptake\n\n【16】B. Increased protein synthesis\n\n【17】C. Increased lipoprotein synthesis\n\n【18】D. Increased β-oxidation\n\n【19】E. Increased glycogen breakdown\nAnswer: 26.3 D . Decreased circulating insulin signals a need to increase hepatic glucose production. This is an energetically demanding process, driven by β-oxidation of fatty acids. However, acetyl-CoA, the major end product of β-oxidation, cannot be used for glucose production. Instead, acetyl-CoA is shunted into the pathway of ketone body synthesis (ketogenesis). By contrast, carbon from intrahepatic glycogen will contribute less to ketone body synthesis in uncontrolled type 1 diabetes mellitus. Net glucose uptake, protein synthesis, and lipoprotein synthesis are decreased, as opposed to increased, during uncontrolled type 1 diabetes.\n\n【20】BIOCHEMISTRY PEARLS\n\n【21】 The liver uses 2 mechanisms for endogenous glucose production, the mobilization of intracellular glycogen (glycogenolysis) and the synthesis of glucose from noncarbohydrate precursors (gluconeogenesis).\n\n【22】 Flux of carbon through the pathways of hepatic glucose metabolism described above is strongly influenced by the hormones insulin, glucagon, and epinephrine.\n\n【23】 Lack of insulin, in the face of elevated glucagon and epinephrine, leads to high rates of hepatic glucose output, driven by β-oxidation of fatty acids. The latter results in an excessive production of ketone bodies and subsequent ketoacidosis.",

Physical examination shows weak to absent left knee patellar reflexes (right knee reflex strong and intact). Laboratory studies show a markedly elevated eosinophil count. A diagnosis is made, and the patient is treated with cyclophosphamide. Further laboratory studies show elevated serum levels of the most common autoantibody associated with this condition. What structure is primarily targeted by the autoantibodies that are most likely elevated in this patient’s serum?\n\n【1】> (A) Acetylcholine receptors\n\n【2】> (B) Neutrophils\n\n【3】> (C) Oligodendrocytes\n\n【4】> (D) RBCs\n\n【5】> (E) Thyroid-stimulating hormone receptors\n\n【6】 Answer: The correct answer is B . This patient has Churg-Strauss syndrome (also known as allergic granulomatosis and angiitis), which is one of a trio of diseases (Wegener granulomatosis and microscopic polyangiitis being the others) that are commonly referred to as the ANCA (antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody)-associated vasculitides (ie, diseases causing inflammation of blood or lymphatic vessels). Fifty to seventy percent of patients with Churg-Strauss syndrome have elevated levels of ANCA, usually the perinuclear pattern of staining type (P-ANCA). Pulmonary vasculature involvement is common and patients often have preexisting asthma and allergic rhinitis. They also present with markedly elevated eosinophil counts and mononeuritis multiplex (simultaneous deficits of two or several peripheral nerves in different areas of the body). Other symptoms includeuveitis, conductive hearing loss, and muscle/joint pain. An eosinophilic gastroenteritis may precede the onset of the other symptoms.  \nAnswer A is incorrect . Autoantibodies to acetylcholine receptors are not particularly associated with Churg-Strauss syndrome. Myasthenia gravis is characterized by an autoimmune attack on the acetylcholine receptors of the neuromuscular junction between motor neurons and skeletal muscle fibers.  \nAnswer C is incorrect . Autoantibodies to oligodendrocytes are not particularly associated with Churg-Strauss syndrome. There is evidence suggesting that multiple sclerosis may be partially caused by autoimmune antibody attack on CNS myelin-secreting oligodendrocytes.  \nAnswer D is incorrect . Autoantibodies to RBCs, which may be found in certain cases of immune hemolytic anemia, are not particularly associated with Churg-Strauss syndrome.  \nAnswer E is incorrect . Autoantibodies to thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptors are not particularly associated with Churg-Strauss syndrome. Graves disease is a disorder resulting from IgG-type autoantibodies to the TSH receptor.",

There is no relevant medical history. She is  删除换行1 a non-smoker who drinks around 8 units of alcohol per week and is taking no medication  删除换行1 except vitamin pills bought over the counter in a health food shop. Her mother has type  删除换行1 2 diabetes. She works as a teacher.\n\n【3】Examination\n\n【4】The lesions over this young woman’s shins are raised and tender. They are of differing  删除换行1 ages and sizes, between 5 and 20 mm, passing through the stages of a bruise as they fade.\nThere are no other skin lesions. Although she reports knee swelling in the past, there is  删除换行1 no current evidence of inflammatory arthropathy.\n\n【5】Questions\n\n【6】• What is the rash?\n\n【7】• What management would be appropriate?\n\n【8】ANSWER 70\n\n【9】The description of the rash is typical of erythema nodosum. This is most common over  删除换行1 the shins although it may occasionally be seen over the arms or thighs. Common causes  删除换行1 for erythema nodosum include:\n\n【10】• pregnancy\n\n【11】• inflammatory bowel disease\n\n【12】• sarcoidosis\n\n【13】• tuberculosis\n\n【14】• streptococcal infection\n\n【15】• drugs (sulphonamides, penicillin, oral contraceptives among others)\n\n【16】• Behçet’s syndrome\n\n【17】• rheumatic fever\n\n【18】• idiopathic.\n\n【19】The history should be directed towards highlighting or eliminating these most common  删除换行1 underlying conditions by seeking out their associated symptoms. Direct questions in the  删除换行1 systems review might therefore include: pregnancy or contraceptive pill use; fever, sore  删除换行1 throat, cough or breathlessness; diarrhoea or abdominal pain; presence and pattern of  删除换行1 arthropathy.

Somatic symptom disorder\n\n【4】E.Illness anxiety disorder\n\n【5】60.1 A 23-year-old pregnant woman complains of an inability to feel her legs. She wonders if the fetus is grabbing her spinal cord. Although she does not appear concerned about her condition， on further questioning she admits that her pregnancy was unplanned and that it has been a source of stress for her and her husband. Her neurologic examination is unremarkable except fordecreased sensation below her waist. The results of a computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging of her brain and spine are normal.\n\n【6】60.2 A 45-year-old man complains of lower back pain and weakness in his legs after lifting heavy boxes while at work. He says that he has not been able to go to work for several days. He requests treatment and a letter excusing him from work. On examination， he is found to have significant lumbar pain without spasms. The strength in his legs is decreased because of a lack of effort. His reflexes are within normal limits. He was observed to be ambulat-ing without any problem in the waiting area prior to the appointment.\n\n【7】60.3 A 38-year-old woman comes in for evaluation of an abscess on her thigh. Her chart documents frequent outpatient and hospital visits. She is admitted， her abscess is drained， and she is treated with antibiotics. Culture studies dem-onstrate microorganisms consistent with fecal matter， and a further physical examination reveals many old scars， presumably self-inflicted.\n\n【8】60.4 A 50-year-old man is referred to a clinician because he has ongoing migraine headaches. His headaches are chronic and bilateral， are worse with loud noises and light， and occur without aura or vomiting. His physi-cal examination is unremarkable except that the patient does not appear to be in significant distress. When he is presented with various options for treatment， including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications， he becomes angry， demanding that acetaminophen with codeine is \"the only thing that has ever helped\" him. When he is told that non-narcotic medica-tions should be tried first， he accuses the provider of not believing him and storms out of the clinic.\n\n【9】60.5 A 53-year-old man pulls a back muscle while doing his usual exercise routine6 months ago. He sought out several medical opinions with sports medicine， orthopedics， and neurology， al IL l of which assured him that he only experi- enced an unfortunate muscle strain. However， the patient currently exhib-its high levels of anxiety and ascribes any ache or pain to some unknown malady. He is so fearful of reinjury that he no longer exercises， always walks with a cane， and is insistent that someone be with him at all times in case he becomes debilitated.\n\n【10】60.6 A healthy 25-year-old man becomes preoccupied with his health after his father has a stroke. This man monitors his blood pressure several times a day， starts an aggressive cardiovascular exercise program， and becomes a vegan. He spends 2 to 3 hours per day reading the latest research in strokes and other cardiovascular disease. He attempts to make quarterly appoint-ments with his primary care provider even though there is no apparent reason to do so.\n\n【11】ANSWERS\n\n【12】60.1 C. The most likely diagnosis for this woman is conversion disorder. She pres-ents with symptoms of a neurologic disorder (motor or sensory) without an obvious cause or trauma. She does not appear particularly concerned about her symptoms (la belle indifference)； however， this is not specific to conversion disorder. There is no obvious possibility of obtaining external gain (answer B). Her motivation does not seem to be assuming the sick role (answer A) but rather expressing an unconscious conflict involving her unwanted pregnancy.\n\n【13】60.2 B. In this case， the most likely diagnosis is malingering. Although this man may indeed have some minor injury， his physical examination is remarkable only in revealing tenderness without spasms. His complaints of weakness and inability to work appear exaggerated given the lack of objective findings. The patient clearly has an obvious external motivation for embellishing his symp-toms， namely， avoiding work.\n\n【14】60.3 A. The most likely diagnosis for this woman is factitious disorder. She pres-ents with a self-induced infection， as well as a history of frequent utilization of hospitalizations and other medical services. Her illnesses are consciously created， without a desire to obtain obvious external gain (answer B) other than assumption of the patient role.\n\n【15】60.4 B. In this case， the most likely diagnosis is malingering. This man presents with only subjective complaints； there are no significant medical findings or apparent suffering. He is angry and defensive， and he appears to be motivated solely by a desire to obtain narcotics rather than appropriate treatment.\n\n【16】60.5 D. In this case， the most likely diagnosis is somatic symptom disorder. This man exhibits a distressing somatic symptom that disrupts his usual life rou-tines， excessive thoughts of his physical condition， and persistent anxiety. His suffering is authentic， whether or not it is medically explained.\n\n【17】60.6 E. This man is preoccupied with acquiring a serious illness， without any somatic symptoms. He demonstrates a high level of anxiety about his health and indulges in excessive health-related behaviors. This symptom array is consistent with the diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder.\n\n【18】CLINICALPEARLS\n\n【19】Consider malingering when there is an inconsistent history or presenta-tion， coupled with the possibility of obtaining an obvious external gain.\n\n【20】Patients with factitious disorder also consciously produce symptoms， but their motivation is to assume the patient/sick role.\n\n【21】A neutral，empathic stance with no abrupt confrontations or accusations of lying often promotes a more effective provider-patient alliance.\n\n【22】Referral to a mental health professional can be indicated to help a malingering individual cope with the ongoing stressors promoting the deception.\n\n【23】The presence of malingering doesn't preclude an individual from having other physical or mental illnesses.",

What other treatments would you recommend at this time?\n5.  What is the patient’s disposition?Rationale and Evidence‐based Practice Explanation\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】### Based on the currently available data, what are the differential diagnoses and the most likely diagnosis for this child?\n\n【11】Differential diagnoses for this child would include anaphylaxis, acute asthma exacerbation, severe croup, urticaria, foreign body aspiration, isolated angioedema, food poisoning, vasovagal episode, idiopathic capillary leak syndrome, and other causes of shock. Anaphylaxis is the most likely diagnosis due to the presentation of facial angioedema, urticaria, and respiratory compromise following an insect sting. Anaphylaxis is commonly misdiagnosed and underdiagnosed when cutaneous signs are not present, so it is important to recognize the other signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis, including, but not limited to, dizziness, hypotension, cough, stridor, dyspnea, vomiting, diarrhea, and wheezing.\n\n【12】### What is the best way to treat this patient’s current signs and symptoms on arrival at the ED?\n\n【13】Epinephrine continues to be the mainstay of treatment for anaphylaxis, with the greatest benefit on administration prior to ED presentation. For pediatric patients, epinephrine should be administered intramuscularly at a dose of 0.01 mg/kg of 1:1000 concentration in the vastus lateralis muscle, with a maximum dose of 0.3 mg but up to 0.5 mg in prepubertal and teenage children. All other medications, including antihistamines, inhaled beta‐agonists and glucocorticoids, are adjuvant medications that should be administered only in addition to, but not to replace, epinephrine.\n\n【14】### How would you determine if the treatment was effective?\n\n【15】Close monitoring for improvement of presenting signs and symptoms are paramount in determining the effectiveness of treatment. In addition, close and continuous monitoring of vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturations, during treatment and until signs and symptoms are resolved are important in determining if other signs of anaphylaxis and shock are present.\n\n【16】### What other treatments would you recommend at this time?\n\n【17】Additional systemic symptoms should be treated with second‐line agents following epinephrine administration, as appropriate, with particular consideration of biphasic anaphylactic reactions. Histamine H <sub>1 </sub> and H <sub>2 </sub> receptor antagonists, such as diphenhydramine and ranitidine, may be administered for cutaneous and gastrointestinal symptoms, and inhaled beta‐agonists, such as albuterol, may be administered to treat reactive airway. Intravenous fluid replacement and oxygen therapies should be provided for patients with hypoxia and hypotension.\n\n【18】### What is the patient’s disposition?\n\n【19】For those patients with concern for protracted or biphasic reactions, they should be monitored in the ED for approximately 3–4 hours after administration of epinephrine to assess for recurrence of symptoms. If symptoms recur, then medications should be re‐dosed for a 24‐hour period and hospitalization is warranted.\n\n【20】Consideration should be made about a referral to an allergy and immunology specialist for treatment with venom immunotherapy for insect sting‐induced anaphylaxis. This treatment can reduce the risk of subsequent anaphylaxis to less than 5% if a full course of therapy is completed.",

        "text": "【0】CASE 47: I’M IMPOTENT\n\n【1】History\n\n【2】A 30-year-old man comes to see you in the general practitioner surgery. He is embarrassed  删除换行1 and explains that he was married last year and is having problems with his sex life. In particular he mentions that since he was married he has had problems maintaining an erection  删除换行1 when he is with his wife. He says that when he has been able to get an erection he often has  删除换行1 a premature ejaculation. His wife has not been able to achieve orgasm. She has been very  删除换行1 understanding and says that she does not mind, but he is concerned that there is something  删除换行1 very wrong with him. He says that their relationship is good and he is very much in love with  删除换行1 his wife. He has not told her that he is seeking advice. On further questioning he indicates  删除换行1 that before he married he was a virgin, but that he did masturbate regularly and had sustained erections. He still occasionally masturbates in private and can sustain an erection for  删除换行1 at least 5 minutes. His erections are normal and not painful. Brief systemic enquiry is normal. He has no polydipsia, polyuria, frequency, other urological symptoms or cardiovascular  删除换行1 symptoms. He is an amateur football player who plays regularly and has not had any difficulties recently with fitness. He drinks socially at weekends only and is a non-smoker. He can  删除换行1 still enjoy himself with his friends and his wife and denies any low mood. His work as owner  删除换行1 of a small plumbing firm is going well.\n\n【3】Physical examination\n\n【4】He is clearly anxious and embarrassed. When you put him at his ease by explaining that the  删除换行1 consultation is confidential and that this is a common problem with one in ten men experiencing it at some time, he becomes more relaxed. There is no evidence of any serious mental  删除换行1 illness.\n\n【5】He has a pulse of 88 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 125/75 mm Hg. His heart  删除换行1 sounds are normal. He is fit and appears healthy. His body mass index is 22. There are no  删除换行1 penile, testicular or scrotal abnormalities, and he has normal muscle and hair distribution.\nThe pulses in his legs and feet are normal. Neurological examination is also normal including  删除换行1 reflexes, fundi, visual fields and motor power. Urine stick test is normal with no sugar.\n\n【6】Questions\n\n【7】• What possible differential diagnoses go through your mind?\n\n【8】• Should you refer him on to a specialist urologist?\n\n【9】• What advice can you give him?\n\n【10】ANSWER 47\n\n【11】Erectile dysfunction can be caused by cardiovascular problems (e.g. vascular disease in diabetes) reducing blood flow to the area, but the fact that this man can sustain an erection at  删除换行1 other times, and the normal cardiovascular examination, make this unlikely. There is no evidence that he has low testosterone. Visual field defects are absent and there is no evidence of  删除换行1 raised intracranial pressure or brain pathology. Smoking and alcohol consumption can affect  删除换行1 sexual function. This is not obviously present but it will be worth asking more questions about  删除换行1 potential illicit drug use or use of any other medications (neuroleptics and antihypertensives  删除换行1 would be the usual culprits). Nervous system disorders that affect sexual function tend to be  删除换行1 those affecting older people such as Parkinson’s disease, cerebrovascular accident or multiple  删除换行1 sclerosis, although trauma to the spine may also affect function. All of these are ruled out here  删除换行1 by history and examination. Some local cancers or local disease (e.g. Peyronie disease) can be  删除换行1 ruled out by normal appearance and the absence of pain or other symptoms. Aggressive cancer  删除换行1 treatment or treatments for some systemic diseases can also affect erectile function.\n\n【12】There is no evidence of any physical illness. A referral to a urologist is likely to make him  删除换行1 more anxious and is unnecessary at this point. The most likely diagnosis is that this man’s  删除换行1 problems are psychological. He is able to sustain a normal erection when he is not with his  删除换行1 wife and he clearly has a high level of performance anxiety. This has been reinforced by experiences of premature ejaculation. Research shows that problems such as this can be greatly  删除换行1 reduced by reduction in anxiety about performance.\n\n【13】In the first instance a lot of reassurance will help, as well as some literature to help him understand how the body works sexually and about different sexual needs within relationships.\nIt will also help to explain the importance of the mind, expectations and circumstances in  删除换行1 sexual relationships, and various self-help books may help him here. If these strategies do not  删除换行1 work then he should return to you for other alternatives. It could be helpful to talk with him  删除换行1 and his spouse together since it is difficult to fully understand the problems of one person in  删除换行1 the relationship when sexuality is often expressed in a dynamic between two people. Discuss  删除换行1 this option with him but respect his wishes. The attitudes and expectations of his wife may  删除换行1 be relevant, and the solution may need to involve them both. It may be that a local couple’s  删除换行1 therapy or psychosexual clinic would help them. In this case, for example, it may be helpful  删除换行1 to take the performance of sexuality out of the equation and ask them to explore each other’s  删除换行1 bodies through massage and caressing with an instruction not to have intercourse. It may be  删除换行1 that mutual masturbation (if acceptable to them culturally) will allow him to see that he can  删除换行1 maintain erection and reduce subsequent performance anxiety. Exploring sexuality together  删除换行1 will also allow them as a couple to better understand each other’s needs and preferences.\n\n【14】Many people’s problems disappear with time and reassurance. A request to visit you again  删除换行1 should the problem persist would allow you to review the situation and make a referral to a psychosexual clinic for support, if the problem does not resolve with reassurance and information.\n\n【15】Key Points\n\n【16】• Many people are anxious about sexual performance, especially in a new  删除换行1 relationship.\n\n【17】• Simple advice and reassurance may be effective, with follow-up should the  删除换行1 situation not improve with time.\n\n【18】• A psychosexual clinic can sometimes be helpful if problems persist.\n\n【19】删除测试2：<u>Case 48: I love him but I don’t want sex\n\n【20】</u>",

        "text": "【0】Case Files® Biochemistry, Third Edition    \n\n【1】CASE 42\n-------\n\n【2】A 38-year-old vegetarian (vegan) Caucasian woman presents to her primary care doctor with fatigue and tingling/numbness in her extremities (bilateral). The symptoms have been gradually getting worse over the last year. Upon further questioning she reports frequent episodes of diarrhea and weight loss. On examination, she is pale and tachycardic. Her tongue is beefy red and a neurologic examination reveals numbness in all extremities with decreased vibration senses. A complete blood count demonstrates megaloblastic anemia.\n\n【3】 What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【4】 What is the most likely underlying problem for this patient?\n\n【5】 What are the 2 most common causes of megaloblastic anemia and how would this patient’s history and examination differentiate these 2 causes?\n\n【6】### ANSWERS TO CASE 42:\n\n【7】#### Cobalamin Deficiency (Vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> )\n\n【8】Summary: A 38-year-old vegetarian woman with gradually worsening fatigue, neurologic and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, and megaloblastic anemia.\n\n【9】• Diagnosis: Cobalamin (vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> ) deficiency.\n\n【10】• Underlying problem: Lack of cobalamin intake with complete vegetarian diet (vegan).\n\n【11】• Causes of megaloblastic anemia: Folate and cobalamin deficiency. Patients with folate deficiency have similar hematologic and GI findings but do not have the neurologic symptoms as with cobalamin deficiency.\n\n【12】### CLINICAL CORRELATION\n\n【13】The 2 most common etiologies of megaloblastic anemia are deficiencies in folate or cobalamin. Cobalamin deficiency can occur from a lack of intake (such as with complete vegetarians), absence of intrinsic factor (either inherited or from removal/damage to gastric mucosa), intestinal organisms, or ileal abnormalities (tropical sprue). Patients present with anemic symptoms, including fatigue, weakness, palpitations, vertigo, and tachycardia. GI symptoms include sore, beefy-red tongue, weight loss, and diarrhea. Both folate and cobalamin deficiencies have similar anemic and GI symptoms. However, cobalamin deficiency also can present with numerous neurologic manifestations including: numbness, paresthesia, weakness, ataxia, abnormal reflexes, diminished vibratory sensation, and disturbances in mentation (from irritability to psychosis). Treatment consists of identifying/treating the underlying cause of deficiency and replacement of cobalamin or folate.\n\n【14】### OBJECTIVES\n\n【15】1\\. Describe the role of cobalamin in red blood cell formation.\n\n【16】2\\. Explain why cobalamin deficiency leads to megaloblastic anemia.\n\n【17】3\\. Develop a comprehension of the role of cobalamin in metabolism.\n\n【18】### DEFINITIONS\n\n【19】COBALAMIN (VITAMIN B <sub>12 </sub> ) DEFICIENCY: Inadequate uptake of cobalamin from the diet; often due to lack of intrinsic factor an intestinal transport protein or less often due to unaugmented vegetarian diet that strictly avoids meat or meat products, the source of dietary cobalamin.\n\n【20】MEGALOBLASTIC ANEMIA: A disturbance in erythroid cell synthesis due to an impaired DNA synthesis. This results in cells with small nuclei and normal cytoplasm, and a high RNA to DNA ratio. Impaired DNA synthesis is due to decreased thymidylate synthetase conversion (C <sub>1 </sub> transfer) of deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) to deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP) as a result of insufficient cobalamin or folate pool impairment.\n\n【21】ONE-CARBON POOL: Folate derivatives that carry a single carbon in various oxidation states (formyl, methenyl, methylene, and methyl) for transfer to acceptor molecules; that is, transfer to deoxyuridine monophosphate to form deoxythymidine monophosphate; transfer to homocysteine to form methionine.\n\n【22】### DISCUSSION\n\n【23】The structure of cobalamin (vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> ) is shown in Figure 42-1 . Cobalamin is somewhat analogous to heme in its structure having as its base a tetrapyrrole ring. Instead of iron as a metal cofactor for heme, cobalamin has cobalt in a coordination state of 6 with a benzimidazole group nitrogen coordinated to one axial position, the 4 equatorial positions coordinated by the nitrogens of the 4 pyrrole groups and the sixth position occupied by either a deoxyadenosine group, a methyl group or a CN <sup>− </sup> group in the commercially available form in vitamin tablets. Dietary cobalamin is absorbed in the Co <sup>3+ </sup> oxidation state and must be reduced by intracellular reductases to the Co <sup>+ </sup> form for use.\n\n【24】删除3：<u>Figure 42-1. The structure of cobalamin, vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> . X = deoxyadenosine in deoxyadenyosylcobalamin; X = CH <sub>3 </sub> in methylcobalamin; X = CN <sup>− </sup> in cyanocobalamin, the commercial form found in vitamin tablets.</u>\n\n【25】Dietary cobalamin is absorbed from animal food sources by a multistage process shown in Figure 42-2 . Cobalamin absorption requires the presence of a protein (the intrinsic factor) secreted from the parietal cells of the stomach to bind cobalamin and aid in its absorption in the ileum. The protein is released into the ileum while the cobalamin is transported to the blood stream where it binds specialized serum proteins, the transcobalamins, which transport it to other tissues such as liver where cobalamin can be stored (usually several milligrams are present in liver). In the absence of the intrinsic factor inadequate amounts of cobalamin are absorbed (the dietary requirement is approximately 200 ng/day) resulting in megaloblastic anemia. When the root cause of the resultant megaloblastic anemia is absence of or inadequate amounts of intrinsic factor the condition is called pernicious anemia. Other conditions or choices may also eventuate in cobalamin deficiency–induced megaloblastic anemia. This condition is also observed in vegetarians who strictly avoid meat and meat products.\n\n【26】通用删除2(英):<u>删除3：<u>Figure 42-2. Absorption, transport, and storage of vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> . IF = intrinsic factor, a glycoprotein secreted by gastric parietal cells; TC = transcobalamins, blood proteins that carry cobalamin to the liver. 删除10：<u>( Reproduced, with permission, from D.B. Marks, et al . Basic Medical Biochemistry: A Clinical Approach. Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins; 1996:619.)</u></u></u>\n\n【27】The cause of megaloblastic anemia seen in strict nonsupplemented vegetarians is attributed to the effects of cobalamin deficiency on DNA synthesis, specifically the thymidylate synthetase reaction, which converts dUMP to dTMP. Inadequate dTMP restricts DNA but not RNA synthesis, leading to the appearance of large erythroid cells with small nuclei containing a high ratio of RNA to DNA. These cells are removed from the circulation, thus stimulating erythrogenesis and giving rise to anemia with an elevated presence of megaloblasts.\n\n【28】This process focuses on the role of cobalamin in folate metabolism. As shown in Figure 42-3 , cobalamin is required for the conversion of homocysteine into methionine. Cobalamin must first undergo methyl transfer to form methyl cobalamin. It receives the methyl group from N通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>5 </sup></u> \\-methyltetrahydrofolate thus regenerating tetrahydrofolate to participate in other one-carbon transfers in purine metabolism or pyrimidine remodeling. If there is a cobalamin deficiency, then the methionine synthase reaction cannot occur, N通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>5 </sup></u> \\-methyltetrahydrofolate accumulates and the other C-1 donor forms of tetrahydrofolate cannot be formed. If N通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>5 </sup></u> , N通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>10 </sup></u> \\-methylenetetrahydrofolate, which is required for the methylation of dUMP to dTMP, cannot be formed, then the thymidylate synthase reaction will be slowed and dTMP levels will drop. An added complication is that the thymidylate synthase reaction produces dihydrofolate unlike all the other C-1 pool reactions, which produce tetrahydrofolate. The dihydro-form must be reduced to the tetrahydro-form by dihydrofolate reductase, which can be inhibited by many drugs. Thus, in the absence of cobalamin, methionine synthesis from homocysteine ceases, allowing the “trapping” of the folate pool as N通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>5 </sup></u> \\-methyltetrahydrofolate, diminishing levels of N通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>5 </sup></u> , N通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>10 </sup></u> \\-methylenetetrahydrofolate, and impairing dTMP formation and, thus, DNA synthesis. Cells requiring regeneration due to turnover feel the brunt of this situation early and thus megaloblastic anemia is a result.\n\n【29】删除3：<u>Figure 42-3. The role of cobalamin as a cofactor in the methylation of homocysteine to methionine.</u>\n\n【30】##### Role of Cobalamin in Metabolism\n\n【31】Cobalamin plays a vital role in the catabolism of odd-chain fatty acids, threonine, methionine, and the branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine), as shown in Figure 42-4 . The degradation of each of the compounds named above produces the same metabolite, propionyl-CoA. This activated 3-carbon fatty acid enters the energy generating metabolic pathway at the level of the citric acid cycle as succinyl-CoA. The process requires 3 specialized enzymes. Propionyl-CoA carboxylase adds another carbon to propionyl-CoA to form D \\-methylmalonyl-CoA in a reaction that requires ATP and the CO <sub>2 </sub> \\-binding cofactor biotin. A racemase converts the D isomer of methylmalonyl-CoA to the L isomer. The last step is catalyzed by methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, a deoxyadenosylcobalamin-requiring enzyme that moves the acyl-CoA group from the methylene carbon to the methyl carbon to form succinyl-CoA. In cases of cobalamin deficiency this reaction is compromised and leads to an accumulation of methylmalonyl-CoA in serum, which has been suggested as a possible source of neurologic defects seen in cobalamin deficiency by decreasing lipid synthesis. Alternatively, impaired biosynthesis of phosphatidyl choline due to decreased levels of methionine and S-adenosylmethionine may play a role for the neurologic symptoms of cobalamin deficiency by compromising the repair of demyelination.\n\n【32】删除3：<u>Figure 42-4.

        "text": "【0】CASE 51: TREATMENT FOR EATING DISORDERS\n\n【1】Samantha is a 27-year-old who has suffered with anorexia nervosa since her teenage years.\nShe has had recurrent admissions to specialist eating-disorders units under Section 3 MHA,  删除换行1 and on a number of occasions has required feeding with a nasogastric tube against her  删除换行1 wishes. During each admission her weight would improve slightly, she would be discharged,  删除换行1 attend outpatient psychotherapy sessions, but subsequently relapse, lose weight and require  删除换行1 readmission.\n\n【2】On this occasion she has been admitted with dangerously low electrolyte and glucose levels  删除换行1 due to her anorexia. She has a body mass index of just 13 and is critically unwell. She has  删除换行1 refused all treatment and therefore is being treated under Section 63 MHA. She initially had  删除换行1 a nasogastric tube inserted (requiring restraint and sedation for the insertion) but has subsequently pulled it out and is currently refusing further nasogastric feeding.\n\n【3】The team is seeking advice as to whether they should continue to attempt nasogastric feeding  删除换行1 in her case.\n\n【4】Questions\n\n【5】• What is the justification for providing nasogastric feeding to patients with anorexia  删除换行1 without their consent?\n\n【6】• What factors should be taken into account when making decisions around appropriateness of treatment in such cases?\n\n【7】ANSWER 51\n\n【8】Samantha has been admitted under Section 3 MHA. Her anorexia constitutes a ‘disorder or  删除换行1 disability of the mind’ and appropriate medical treatment is necessary for her own health  删除换行1 and safety. As she is refusing treatment (and such treatment can be provided only if she is  删除换行1 detained), an admission under Section 3 is necessary.\n\n【9】Appropriate treatment which could be given to Samantha without her consent could include  删除换行1 psychotherapy and psychiatric medications but may also extend to nasogastric feeding.\n‘Treatment’ as referred to in the MHA can include medical treatment for ‘alleviating, or preventing a worsening of, a mental disorder or one or more of its symptoms or manifestations’  删除换行1 删除10：<u>(MHA Code of Practice 2015)</u>. Nasogastric feeding in anorexic patients treats the physical  删除换行1 manifestations of their mental disorder (i.e. treats the malnutrition which results from the  删除换行1 patient’s lack of food intake). It may also maintain and improve their physical health enough  删除换行1 to allow them to gain the cognitive ability to participate in psychological therapies, and  删除换行1 weight gain may even be psychologically therapeutic in itself.\nSamantha should be treated in accordance with her best interests. However, these are difficult  删除换行1 to determine. Both possible courses of action here – deciding not to give Samantha nasogastric feeding, or alternatively forcing her to have nasogastric feeding against her will – have the  删除换行1 potential to result in harm. Deciding not to provide feeding could result in her death, which  删除换行1 would fail to give appropriate weight to the sanctity of life principle. On the other hand,  删除换行1 forcing Samantha to have nasogastric feeding fails to respect her autonomy, and whilst her  删除换行1 ability to make autonomous decisions may be adversely affected by her mental illness, there  删除换行1 is still an inherent moral good in taking into account her wishes. Additionally, the need for  删除换行1 physical restraint could amount to inhuman and degrading treatment contravening Article 3  删除换行5 ECHR, although this is unlikely if it can be convincingly shown to be a therapeutic necessity.\n\n【10】Although Samantha has a mental illness, it is important that the doctors still involve her in  删除换行1 decisions regarding her care as much as possible. The views of her family and friends may be  删除换行1 valuable, particularly given the support she may require from them during her treatment.\nFurthermore, the likely success of the various treatment options should be considered, as this  删除换行1 will be important in assessing whether the proposed benefits are sufficiently great to justify  删除换行1 the potential harms that may be associated with each treatment option.\n\n【11】Key Points\n\n【12】• Nasogastric feeding is recognised as a potential treatment that may be enforced  删除换行1 under Section 63 MHA for patients with eating disorders.\n\n【13】• The appropriateness of enforced nasogastric feeding must be considered. Factors  删除换行1 such as the patient’s wishes, previous treatments, the need for restraint and the  删除换行1 patient’s prognosis should be taken into account.",

Thanks to the resident of respiratory ward who found her symptoms met criteria of KD and requested consultation with. Luckily she was treated on time.\n2.  2.\n    Aspirin has been the first choice to treat KD. This girl developed rashes after taking aspirin when she had recurrent KD. Considering she had taken aspirin before and did not have itch, we continued to give her aspirin and monitored the dynamic changes in rashes at the same time. Eventually, rashes regressed. We concluded that she was not allergic to aspirin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n3.  3.\n    It has been reported that about 1–2% KD patients will have recurrent KD within 2 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. During the treatment for her first KD, aspirin was stopped earlier, and there was no record showing when she stopped taking aspirin during recurrent KD. Coronary dilation was not found until on Day11 of recurred KD.\n4.  4.\n    KD vasculitis can present all over the body, which can cause inflammation in intestinal arteries, leading to edema in intestinal wall. As a result of this edema, indigitation is developed and will need warm saline clysis to be relieved (case 25). However, if it is not identified on time, the complication can lead to intestinal obstruction, and then the necrosis segment need to be surgically removed. This girl had incomplete indigitation, and the inflammation regressed after IVIG and oral aspirin treatment, and then edema in intestine settled subsequently.\n5.  5.\n    The most common complication in KD is digestive system symptoms. When this patient had recurrence of KD, she had black stool and dark brown urine. Investigation revealed higher T Bil and major in D Bil, positive urobilirubin, which supported she had cholestatic hepatitis (case 17).\n6.  6.\n    In KD, inflammatory mediators may cause necrosis of adrenal medulla 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. It is not clear how calcification is developed in acute stage and there is no literature reporting this. The calcification was found by chance in chest CT performed in her first KD diagnosis.

        "text": "【0】Case Files® Biochemistry, Third Edition    \n\n【1】CASE 35\n-------\n\n【2】A 9-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department (ED) by his parents after 2 days of worsening nausea/vomiting and abdominal pain. The abdominal pain is located in the epigastric region and radiates to his back. He has had several episodes of similar pain in the past but none quite as severe as this one. His parents deny fever/chills and change in bowel habits. In the ED, the patient is afebrile and in moderate distress. Both the liver and spleen appear to be enlarged and he has epigastric tenderness. Several small yellow-white papules were noted on his back and buttocks. Laboratory tests reveal elevated amylase and lipase levels. On further questioning, the father reports having high triglyceride levels and several members of the mother’s family have had early heart disease. Laboratory tests performed after hospitalization revealed elevated triglyceride levels and reduced lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity.\n\n【3】 What is etiology of the boy’s abdominal pain?\n\n【4】 What is the likely underlying biochemical disorder?\n\n【5】 What is the role of lipoprotein lipase?\n\n【6】### ANSWERS TO CASE 35:\n\n【7】#### Hypertriglyceridemia (Lipoprotein Lipase Deficiency)\n\n【8】Summary: A 9-year-old boy with acute abdominal pain consistent with pancreatitis, hepatosplenomegaly, eruptive xanthomas, and a family history of hypertriglyceridemia and heart disease.\n\n【9】• Etiology of abdominal pain: Acute pancreatitis\n\n【10】• Underlying biochemical disorder: Disorder of lipoprotein metabolism\n\n【11】• Role of lipoprotein lipase: Hydrolysis of triglycerides from very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and chylomicrons\n\n【12】### CLINICAL CORRELATION\n\n【13】LPL is an enzyme found on the capillary endothelial surface of adipose tissue, heart, and skeletal muscle, and it is required, along with apoC-II, for the hydrolysis of triglycerides. ApoC-II, found on the surface of chylomicrons and VLDL, serves as an activator of LPL. A deficiency in LPL results in elevated levels of triglycerides (VLDL and chylomicrons). The cholesterol level may be normal or slightly elevated. LPL deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Patients with LPL deficiency often present with recurrent episodes of pancreatitis in their childhood and may have other clinical signs of hypertriglyceridemia, including xanthomas, hepatosplenomegaly, and lipemia retinalis. Reduced serum LPL activity, following an injection of intravenous heparin, confirms the diagnosis of either LPL or apoC-II deficiency. The initial therapeutic intervention consists primarily of dietary modification (reduction of fat intake).\n\n【14】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【15】#### Lipid Transport\n\n【16】### OBJECTIVES\n\n【17】1\\. Describe the metabolism and transport of lipoproteins.\n\n【18】2\\. Understand the rationale for serum blood test results with the different hypertriglyceridemias.\n\n【19】### DEFINITIONS\n\n【20】APOLIPOPROTEIN C-II (APOC-II): The apolipoprotein on the surface of chylomicrons and VLDLs that binds to and activates lipoprotein lipase.\n\n【21】APOLIPOPROTEIN E (APOE): The apolipoprotein on the surface of several lipoproteins including chylomicrons, chylomicron remnants, very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), VLDL remnants, and intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL). It mediates the binding of apoE-containing lipoproteins with the LDL receptor and the chylomicron remnant (apoE) receptor.\n\n【22】LIPOPROTEIN LIPASE (LPL): An enzyme bound to the surface of the capillary endothelium by heparan sulfate proteoglycans. LPL catalyzes the hydrolysis of triglyceride in chylomicrons and VLDL to free fatty acids and glycerol.\n\n【23】HEPATIC LIPASE (HL): An enzyme bound to the surface of sinusoidal endothelial cells of liver. It catalyzes the hydrolysis of mono-, di-, and triglycerides as well as the phospholipids phosphatidyl choline and phosphatidyl ethanolamine.\n\n【24】### DISCUSSION\n\n【25】Triglycerides (TGs) are safely transported in the bloodstream packaged into lipoproteins called chylomicrons or VLDLs. Chylomicrons are formed in the epithelial cells of the intestine and are responsible for the transport of dietary lipids. VLDL is synthesized in the liver and transport endogenously synthesized lipids from the liver to peripheral tissues. Both of these lipoproteins are composed of a core composed primarily of TGs enveloped by a monolayer composed of phospholipids, free cholesterol, and apolipoproteins.\n\n【26】Dietary triglycerides are hydrolyzed by pancreatic lipase in the lumen of the small intestine. Colipase, a protein secreted along with pancreatic lipase, binds to the TG and the pancreatic lipase and improves the hydrolytic process. TG is broken down to free fatty acids and 2-monoacylglycerols, which form micelles along with bile salts and other lipid soluble compounds such as cholesterol and fat-soluble vitamins. The free fatty acids and monoglycerides are absorbed by the microvilli of the intestinal epithelial cells. In the epithelial cell, the fatty acids and monoglycerides are reformed into triglycerides, which are packaged with phospholipids, cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B-48 into chylomicrons.\n\n【27】The newly synthesized chylomicrons are secreted into the lymph and enter the bloodstream via the thoracic duct. In the bloodstream, the chylomicron particles obtain proteins from high-density lipoproteins (HDLs), including apoC II and apoE, which are important for the function of the chylomicron 删除33：<u></u>.\n\n【28】删除3：<u>Figure 35-1. Formation and metabolism of chylomicrons. (Abbreviations used are defined in the enclosed box.)</u>\n\n【29】In the capillary beds in adipose tissue, muscle tissue (especially cardiac muscle) and in lactating mammary glands, apoC II binds to and activates LPL, which is bound to the endothelial surface of the capillaries by heparan sulfate. LPL hydrolyzes the TG in the core of the chylomicron to free fatty acids and glycerol. The fatty acids are taken up by the adipose or muscle cells; glycerol is recycled back to the liver. In muscle, the fatty acids are oxidized to produce ATP and in adipose they are reformed into TG for storage. The TG-depleted chylomicron remnant remains in the blood stream until it binds to the chylomicron remnant receptor located on hepatocytes, a process mediated by apoE. The remnants are taken into the hepatocytes by endocytosis and degraded in the lysosome to fatty acids, amino acids, cholesterol, glycerol, and phosphate.\n\n【30】Chylomicrons appear in the blood stream shortly after consumption of a meal containing fat. However, the clearance rate for chylomicrons is fast and blood is usually free of chylomicrons following an overnight fast.\n\n【31】VLDLs are lipoproteins synthesized in the liver from endogenous TG, cholesterol, and phospholipids, along with several apolipoproteins including, apoB-100, apoE, and apoC-II. Following synthesis, the VLDL is secreted into the bloodstream, where it obtains more apoE and apoC II from HDL 删除33：<u></u>. In a process similar to that of chylomicron degradation, the VLDL apoC-II binds to and activates LPL in the capillary beds of adipose, muscle, and mammary tissue. LPL degrades the VLDL TG core, releasing free fatty acids and glycerol. About one-half of the resulting VLDL remnants bind to receptors in liver cells that recognized apoE and are taken up by endocytosis. The remaining VLDL receptors are further degraded to IDLs, which have their residual TG removed by the action of hepatic lipase to yield low-density lipoproteins (LDLs). HL is synthesized and secreted from liver and is tethered to the external surfaces of liver cells by heparan sulfate. LDL is taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis upon binding to the LDL receptor in liver and peripheral tissues.\n\n【32】删除3：<u>Figure 35-2. Formation of very-low-density lipoprotein and metabolism into low-density lipoprotein. 删除33：<u>通用删除1(英):<u>(Abbreviations are as used in Figure 35-1 .)</u></u></u>\n\n【33】Elevated serum TG levels can occur due to a number of factors. Hypertriglyceridemia can be the result of a genetic disorder in one of the proteins involved in lipoprotein metabolism, or it can arise secondarily to a number of other disorders, including diabetes mellitus, obesity, and alcohol abuse, and as an adverse event of some medications such as β-blockers, oral estrogens, and some diuretics. Genetic deficiencies in LPL, apoC-II, or HL can give rise to elevations in circulating TG, as can cause an overproduction of apoB-100 or increased apoE <sub>2 </sub> levels. ApoE <sub>2 </sub> has a decreased affinity for hepatic receptors than apoE <sub>3 </sub> and chylomicron remnants and VLDL remnants containing apoE <sub>2 </sub> are cleared more slowly from the circulation.\n\n【34】The most common genetic defect leading to hypertriglyceridemia is a deficiency in LPL, which results in increased levels of both chylomicrons and VLDL. Individuals who are homozygous for the defective gene usually present with symptoms of chylomicronemia (TG levels > 2000 mg/dL, abdominal pain, pancreatitis, xanthomas, lipemia retinalis) in childhood. Clinical diagnosis of LPL deficiency requires measurement of LPL activity in plasma following intravenous injection of heparin, which displaces the LPL from its heparan sulfate tether. However, heparin also releases HL into the plasma and the postheparin plasma must be treated with antibodies specific to HL to remove it. Alternatively, LPL can also be measured in adipose tissue, which has no HL activity. A deficiency in apoC II will also show evidence of decreased postheparin plasma LPL activity. An increase in LPL activity when normal apoC II is added to the assay indicates that a defect in apoC-II is the culprit.\n\n【35】A deficiency in HL can also lead to elevated plasma TG levels, however, these increases in TG are usually found in VLDL remnants, LDL, and HDL, which all become more buoyant in their densities. Definitive diagnosis of HL deficiency is made by demonstrating the absence of HL activity in postheparin plasma.\n\n【36】###",

She also used shea butter on her face to help even out her skin tone. Her menstrual cycles were normal.\n\n【11】Physical Examination\n--------------------\n\n【12】On examination, multiple erythematous papules and pustules and enlarged pores were noted on the cheeks, nose, jawline, and chin. Hyperpigmented macules were also noted on the cheeks and the jawline. A 1 cm erythematous cyst was noted on the right nasal sidewall 删除33：<u></u>.

An erythematous cyst is noted on the right nasal sidewall</u>\n\n【15】Differential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【16】Comedonal acne should be distinguished from acneiform eruptions from follicular occlusion, like pomade and occupational acne. Sebaceous hyperplasia, characterized by yellowish, indurated papules on the forehead and cheeks, is common in adults. Inflammatory acne can be confused with folliculitis (staphylococcal, gram negative, or eosinophilic). Lesions from folliculitis are typically monomorphic papules, and comedones are not present. Papulopustular rosacea favors the forehead, malar region, and the chin. Patients also have telangiectasias and report a history of flushing. Although rosacea typically occurs at a later age, both acne and rosacea can occur in a single individual. Perioral dermatitis is characterized by monomorphic papules and pustules, usually resulting from prolonged use of corticosteroids. Neurotic excoriations on the face, chest, and back can also be confused with acne 删除10：<u>(Zaenglein and Thiboutot 2008 )</u>.\n\n【17】Histopathology\n--------------\n\n【18】Acne is a clinical diagnosis, and biopsy is typically not indicated. However, biopsy of an acneiform lesion shows a microcomedo with infundibular dilatation and narrowing of the follicular opening. As the follicular epithelium distends, cystic contents rupture into the dermis. The acute inflammatory reaction is characterized by neutrophils creating pustules, foreign body granulation tissue, and subsequent end stage scarring 删除10：<u>(Zaenglein and Thiboutot 2008 )</u>.\n\n【19】Diagnosis\n---------\n\n【20】Acne vulgaris\n\n【21】Case Treatment\n--------------\n\n【22】A gentle cleanser was recommended for both morning and evening. A combination benzoyl peroxide/clindamycin gel was recommended for the morning, and a tretinoin 0.1 % cream was recommended for the evening. The patient was also started on doxycycline 100 mg twice daily. A moisturizer with a broad spectrum sunscreen (SPF 30) was recommended for the morning. This same moisturizer was recommended for the evening to prevent irritation from tretinoin. She was advised to discontinue her use of shea butter, as it is typically comedogenic. She was seen back in clinic in 3 months to attempt to taper the doxycycline.\n\n【23】Discussion\n----------\n\n【24】Acne is one of the most common skin disorders in people with skin of color. Practice surveys at the Skin of Color Center in New York City 删除10：<u>(Alexis et al. 2007 )</u>, Howard University in Washington, D.C. 删除10：<u>(Halder et al. 1983 )</u>, and in south-east London 删除10：<u>(Child et al. 1999 )</u> reported that acne vulgaris was the most common diagnosis in patients with skin of color, accounting for 28 % of dermatoses.\n\n【25】The pathogenesis of acne is due to four well known factors: excessive sebum production; abnormal follicular keratinization and plugging; proliferation of Propionobacter acnes ; Hormone changes also contribute to acne pathogenesis. 删除10：<u>(Callender 2004 ; Leyden 1995 )</u>. Although this classic pathophysiology is shared amongst all skin types, subsequent evolution of the acne lesion and the degree of inflammation at clinical presentation may vary among individuals according to their skin types. In particular, nodulocystic acne appears to be more common in Caucasians and Hispanics than in African Americans 删除10：<u>(Callender 2004 ; Taylor et al. 2002 )</u>. Pore size may also explain differences in acne presentation, as enlarged pore size is highly correlated with sebum output and may contribute to acne pathogenesis. Epidemiologic studies demonstrate that gland pores are larger in patients with skin of color 删除10：<u>(Yin and McMichael 2014 )</u>.\n\n【26】Clinically, acne vulgaris is characterized by open and closed comedones, papules, pustules, nodules, and cysts 删除33：<u></u>. Lesions are usually present on the forehead, cheeks, jawline, chin, chest, and upper back. In patients with skin of color, postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH), characterized by hyperpigmented macules, may be present after the lesions heal 删除33：<u></u>.\n\n【27】删除3：<u>Figure 1.2\n\n【28】Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation secondary to acne. Hyperpigmented macules are noted on the forehead, cheeks, and jawline</u>\n\n【29】Although acne treatment for patients with skin of color are similar to those for patients with lighter skin, specific considerations exist, especially due to the risk of PIH. Clinically, PIH presents as hyperpigmented macules or patches which correspond to the area of injury. Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation can develop in response to the acne itself or to any overly aggressive acne treatment that disturbs the skin. Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation is thought to be a default pathophysiologic response of darker skin to cutaneous injury in which the inflammation triggers an increase in epidermal or dermal melanogenesis from labile melanocytes 删除10：<u>(Callender 2004 ; Taylor et al. 2002 )</u>. For many patients, the lingering PIH is more psychologically disturbing than the acne itself.\n\n【30】Permanent and disfiguring keloid formation is also more common following acne in skin of color. The biologic basis for a tendency for scarring in patients with skin of color may involve differences in fibroblast size and activity, immune related cellular actions, and growth factors—all of which seem to combine to promote production of excess collagen and inhibit degradation of the extracellular matrix 删除10：<u>(Callender 2004 ; Taylor et al. 2002 )</u>.\n\n【31】Hair care practices among patients with skin of color may also cause a unique form of acne known as pomade acne. The daily use of pomades on the hair and scalp to overcome an inherent tendency for hair dryness and fragility often leads to a characteristic distribution of comedonal acne on the forehead and anterior hair line 删除10：<u>(Callender 2004 )</u>. Additionally, corticosteroid containing skin bleaching agents that are used by some individuals with darker skin to improve hyperpigmentation may induce steroid acne, which may further worsen PIH 删除10：<u>(Shah and Alexis 2010 )</u>.\n\n【32】Treatment\n---------\n\n【33】The treatment of acne in patients with skin of color can present unique challenges, both pathophysiologically (i.e. risk of PIH and keloid scarring) and culturally (i.e. use of skin and hair care products). The overall goal of acne management is to select treatment that addresses as many of its pathogenic factors as possible while minimizing potential PIH 删除10：<u>(Alexis et al. 2007 )</u>. Because acne treatment can cause cutaneous irritation that initiates or exacerbates PIH in darker-skinned patients, the patient’s skin should be carefully assessed to determine the risk of irritant contact dermatitis.\n\n【34】Topical retinoids are the top choice for first line therapy, as not only do they target hyperkeratinization and comedogenesis, but they also possess direct anti-inflammatory and antifibroblastic actions, and may block the key pathophysiologic pathways leading to PIH and keloids 删除10：<u>(Callender 2004 ; Alexis 2011 )</u>. Special care should be taken in selecting the most appropriate retinoid vehicle. For skin of color, cream based formulations of retinoids are often initiated because there is a decreased likelihood of irritation and resultant PIH. Retinoid formulations may also be started on an alternate-day dosing regimen to decrease irritation. Another useful strategy is to start with the lowest concentration and titrate up as tolerated to minimize retinoid dermatitis and the risk of PIH 删除10：<u>(Alexis 2011 )</u>.\n\n【35】Topical antibiotics like clindamycin and erythromycin are effective in reducing P. acnes and help reduce inflammation. Adding an antimicrobial agent to a topical retinoid regimen can result in a more rapid and complete resolution of acne lesions and PIH. In addition, the use of a fixed combination agent (topical antibiotic plus benzoyl peroxide) is recommended to assist in preventing new acne lesions and reduces the risk of antibiotic resistance 删除10：<u>(Alexis 2014 )</u>. Reducing potential irritation and dryness, which may adversely affect darker skin, can be achieved by using benzoyl peroxide in low concentrations and in a cream or water-based gel.\n\n【36】Azelaic acid has been used to treat both inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions. Because azelaic acid is considered to have a low potential for irritation, it may be suitable for patients with dark sensitive skin or with a history of PIH. Furthermore, because it inhibits melanin synthesis, it is also somewhat effective in treating PIH 删除10：<u>(Webster 2000 )</u>.\n\n【37】Hydroquinone is the gold standard for treating PIH associated with acne. Hydroquinone inhibits conversion of tyrosine to melanin and alters several normal activities of the melanosomes. It is important to monitor extended hydroquinone use to avoid risk of exogenous ochronosis, which is characterized by asymptomatic blue-black or slate-gray speckled macules typically affecting the malar eminences, temples, and inferior cheeks. Although uncommon in the United States 删除10：<u>(Lawrence et al. 1988 )</u>, hydroquinone induced exogenous ochronosis of the face can be difficult to treat. The more common adverse effects of hydroquinone include irritant and allergic contact dermatitis and temporary hypopigmentation of surrounding normal skin. Therefore, it is important to use only on dark areas, not for full facial treatment 删除10：<u>(Callender 2004 )</u>.\n\n【38】Broad spectrum antibiotics like doxycycline, minocycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and cephalosporins are often added to topical medications for moderate to severe inflammatory acne. There is a preference for doxycycline over minocycline given the risk of bluish pigmentation deposition in acne scars with minocycline. Isotretinoin, a systemic retinoid, is the treatment for nodulocystic acne. Isotretinoin must be used with caution in child bearing women given its risk of teratogenicity. Androgens also play a central role in over stimulation of sebaceous glands in patients with acne. To counteract the androgenic hormones, a variety of hormonal therapies have been used, including oral contraceptives and androgen receptor blockers (i.e. spironolactone) 删除10：<u>(Callender 2004 )</u>. In skin of color, a lower threshold for systemic agents may be advisable to reduce inflammation at an earlier stage, thus reducing the risk of PIH and scarring.\n\n【39】Adjunct therapies reserved for cases of advanced acne, include intralesional corticosteroids (especially for keloids), manual comedonal extraction, and chemical peels. Salicylic acid peels are generally safe and effective in skin of color. They are comedolytic, accelerate the clearance of epidermal melanin, and increase the penetration of topical agents 删除10：<u>(Grimes 1999 )</u>. Although chemical peels can be used safely in skin of color, they should be applied conservatively, with careful consideration of any irritation that may result in PIH.\n\n【40】In addition to combination therapy, certain practical measures should be taken to identify and reduce exacerbating factors. First, a careful patient history should be obtained to review what patients have used to treat acne on their own. Many patients with PIH use products such as cocoa butter to attempt to even their skin tone; however, these products can be comedogenic and exacerbate acne. A careful history of hair care product use is also important, since certain hair emollients can exacerbate acne 删除10：<u>(Callender et al. 2014 )</u>. In addition, patients should be counseled to avoid harsh exfoliants, which may contribute to PIH by causing irritation. A careful history may reveal that some patients have tried online “fade creams” that paradoxically contain corticosteroids, which in turn increase acne and subsequent PIH. Finally, many skin of color patients believe that their skin is resistant to effects of ultraviolet radiation. Therefore, the daily use of a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 should be recommended to help prevent exacerbation of PIH. A noncomedogenic vehicle should be selected 删除10：<u>(Callender et al. 2014 )</u>.\n\n【41】Key Points\n\n【42】   Management of acne in patients with skin of color can be particularly challenging, given their potential for cosmetically disturbing complications, including postinflammatory hyperpigmentation and keloids.\n   The overall goal of acne management is to select a treatment that addresses as many pathogenic factors as possible while minimizing potential postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.\n   Acne treatments designed to dry the skin, such as benzoyl peroxide, should be carefully chosen. These medications may irritate the skin and prolong post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.\n   Hair care practices using oil based products may cause pomade acne.\n   Comedogenic moisturizers or steroid based fade creams can worsen acne in skin of color.",

Undiagnosed salpingitis\n\n【23】ANSWERS\n\n【24】38.1 C. There is a predominance of anaerobes in bacterial vaginosis. The vaginal pH in BV is usually>4.5， and the discharge is homogenous. The most com-mon symptom is a fishy or\"musty”odor when introduced to an alkaline sub-stance (ie，10%KOH， semen， or menses). Clue cells are found on microscopy. BV is associated with genital tract infection， such as endometritis， pelvic inflammatory disease， and pregnancy complications， such as preterm delivery and PPROM. Frothy discharge， normal to acidic pH， and flagellated organ-isms are more typical of trichomoniasis.\n\n【25】38.2 C. After antibiotic therapy， candidal organisms often proliferate and may induce an overt infection. The mechanism is likely that the lactobacilli are eliminated by the antibiotic， allowing overgrowth of yeast. Treatment of can-didal vulvovaginitis is oral fluconazole or imidazole cream. Metronidazole is used to treat BV and T. vaginalis. Patients should be instructed to avoid alco-hol while taking metronidazole to avoid a disulfiram reaction. Erythromycin may be used in the treatment of syphilis in nonpregnant women allergic to penicillin. Clindamycin is typically used in conjunction with gentamicin in the treatment of infections requiring broad-spectrum antibiotics，necessitat-ing anaerobic coverage (ie，postpartum endomyometritis). H ydrocortisone is most commonly indicated for severe allergic reactions.\n\n【26】38.3B. Trichomonas vaginalis is a hardy organism and may be isolated from a wet surface up to 6 hours after inoculation. The organisms difficulty to eradicate is the reason that therapy requires high tissue levels， metronidazole 2 g orally all at once， to be able to obtain sufficiently high tissue levels to be effective. Not uncommonly， a single course is not effective， and a 2-or 3-day course of metronidazole of high dose orally is needed.\n\n【27】38.4 C. The patient takes 2 g of metronidazole as a single dose to attain sufficient tissue levels to eradicate the trichomonads. Metronidazole gel is not as effec-tive. Erythematous vagina and punctuations of the cervix (strawberry cervix) are classic findings of the inflammatory effects induced by trichomoniasis. Classic findings in candidal vaginitis include the curdy or cottage cheese appearance of the vaginal discharge with hyphae or pseudohyphae found on microscopy after discharge is mixed with KOH； this would be treated by flu-conazole. HPV is associated with findings of cervical dysplasia. Ceftriaxone and doxycycline is the treatment for PID. Metronidazole gel would treat BV.\n\n【28】38.5 C. The most common side effects from metronidazole are gastrointestinal including nausea， abdominal discomfort， bloating or diarrhea. A disulfi-ram (Antabuse) effect that can be seen with metronidazole includes facial flushing， headache， hypotension， tachycardia， dizziness， and nausea and vomiting.\n\n【29】CLINICALPEARLS\n删除38：<u>)</u>The three most common types of vaginal infections are trichomoniasis， candidal vaginitis， and bacterial vag inosis.

        "text": "【0】#### Research involving prisoners\n\n【1】##### Why are prisoners <sup>a </sup> vulnerable?\n\n【2】Prisoners are not a homogenous group. Statistically, they include a higher percentage of members from other vulnerable groups, such as the poor, illiterate, mentally ill, and – in many countries – foreigners who do not understand or speak the local language sufficiently to understand explanations regarding research.\n\n【3】As a group, prisoners are vulnerable due to their particular situation: being detained and therefore being deprived of the freedom to move freely, which implies that they are, possibly, under the influence of different kinds of pressures. Several prison-related factors are relevant for ethical considerations about research involving prisoners.\n\n【4】First, prisoners are vulnerable because they have limited choices: they cannot freely choose and consult their own physician. Their access to healthcare depends on the available health structures. Prisoners might not have access to alternative healthcare or adequate and independent clinical advice when a research study is carried out in a prison.\n\n【5】Second, prisoners are vulnerable because the pressures from prison officers and co-detainees, as well as pressures resulting from their living conditions, could interfere with free informed consent. Prisoners might accept participation in research because they fear punishment if they do not participate. Hierarchical structures are strong among prison inmates and leaders might force others to participate or, on the contrary, could force inmates not to participate. Prisoners are also vulnerable to real or perceived incentives to become a research subject, especially if they think that participation could be advantageous because research subjects obtain better living conditions or shorter prison terms than other prisoners.\n\n【6】Among ethics scholars and researchers, controversy exists as to whether prisoners should be considered competent to give informed consent. At one extreme are those who, based on the principle of beneficence, claim that, since studies are lacking which prove prisoners’ capacity to give truly informed consent, one should not let them decide on their own. At the other extreme is the opinion that prisoners should not be treated differently from other potential research subjects, since their mental faculties are not fundamentally changed by detention. A part of this question is empirical: there has been insufficient exploration of whether prisoners have a tendency to make different decisions while in prison from those they would make if they were not detained. A second argument refers to the right to respect autonomy: being deprived of liberty does not include deprivation of the autonomy to decide about one’s body and healthcare-related issues. Treating prisoners, by definition, as incompetent concerning health-related matters is a violation of their human rights.\n\n【7】###### What follows from the vulnerability of prisoners for research ethics?\n\n【8】The vulnerability of prisoners has triggered various strategies for their protection against research risks and abuse.通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>16,17 </sup></u> Strategies are used either alone or cumulatively by different guidelines and legislations.\n\n【9】The first is characterized by different forms of restrictions. The most extreme form is general prohibition of all forms of research with prisoners as is the case in some of the US. Others, such as US federal regulations, allow only certain categories of research to be carried out with prisoners. Categories are allowed either because they imply only minimal risk or because their benefits are particularly important and outweigh the (limited) risks.通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>18 </sup></u> The Council of Europe varies restrictions according to the type of benefit. It restricts only research that does not promise direct benefit to prisoners. If research is expected to produce indirect benefit, i.e. benefit only to prisoners as a group, it is allowed only if three conditions are fulfilled: “(i) Research of comparable effectiveness cannot be carried out without the participation of persons deprived of liberty; (ii) The research has the aim of contributing to the ultimate attainment of results capable of conferring benefit to persons deprived of liberty; (iii) The research entails only minimal risk and minimal burden”. Research without at least indirect benefit is prohibited.通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>16,17</sup></u>\n\n【10】A second strategy is to require higher efforts than with nonprisoners to assure informed consent and freedom of choice. This could imply that prisoners should be informed several times and particular tests could be indicated to ensure that they have understood the information. It could also mean to provide prisoners with more time than nonprisoners to consider their decisions. Most regulations prohibit incentives in the form of money or better living conditions or influence on prison terms. Other means to ensure that prisoners’ choices are in line with their best medical interest is to grant them access to an independent and qualified doctor who is not part of the research team who could advise prisoner patients impartially.\n\n【11】A third strategy is to increase oversight mechanisms by research ethics committees (RECs) or ERCs. <sup>b </sup> In the US, for example, ERCs that approve research with prisoners need to have a particular composition including a prisoner representative who has experience with prison healthcare. RECs should receive clear indications how to evaluate specific ethical issues concerning research with prisoners such as the principle of subsidiarity and issues of distributive justice: prisoners should not bear a disproportionate burden of research risks, and research should be carried out inside prisons only if results of comparable efficiency and meaning cannot be obtained with nonprisoners. Stricter oversight mechanisms might include the obligation to visit the prison before, during, and after the study to control whether confidentiality, informed consent, and other ethical requirements are respected.\n\n【12】A fourth strategy is to require special ethical training for researchers carrying out research with prisoners to assure that they are aware of ethical issues and specific risks related to research with prisoners, and engage themselves in the protection of prisoners from abuse through research.\n\n【13】Such strategies are important to protect prisoners from the risk of abuse, and preferable to their exclusion from research entirely. Empirical studies inside prisons can be beneficial and are necessary to obtain evidence-based answers to some research questions that need to be addressed in order to improve prisoners’ healthcare.\n\n【14】#### Key points\n\n【15】• With children, prisoners, and other vulnerable populations, the challenge is to find the right balance between protection from abuse and the need to grant vulnerable populations access to participation in research.\n\n【16】• Although the exclusion of vulnerable subjects from a specific study will sometimes be an appropriate way to minimize their risk of being wronged in the conduct of research, this will not always be true.\n\n【17】• Studies designed to address health problems specific to a vulnerable population are needed to improve care for this very population, and often cannot be conducted on others.\n\n【18】• Participation in research can hold a prospect of benefit from which it is sometimes wrong to exclude vulnerable persons. In such cases, enrollment with special protections tailored to the sort of wrong to be avoided is ethically preferable to exclusion.\n\n【19】Notes 删除换行1 a In this text, the term “prisoner” is meant to include any kind of detained person, in any kind of detention facility. The term prison is used in its British meaning all kinds of detention facilities, such as jails, federal prisons or other places of detention.\n\n【20】b Institutional review boards (terminology used in the US). In this chapter we do not make any difference between the terminology: both REC and IRB refers to the competent body of research oversight in a given country.\n\n【21】####",

One of the drugs he is taking causes him to have periodic fevers and chills and a sense of depression that he did not have prior to treatment. Which of the following drugs most likely is responsible for this patient’s adverse effects?\n\n【1】> (A) Intravenous immunoglobulin\n\n【2】> (B) Lamivudine\n\n【3】> (C) Pegylated interferon\n\n【4】> (D) Ribavirin\n\n【5】> (E) Tumor necrosis factor-α\n\n【6】 Answer: The correct answer is C . Pegylated interferon is a cytokine derivative that improves the body’s antiviral response. It is used in the treatment of HBV and HCV. Adverse effects of interferon therapy include a flu-like reaction that manifests as episodic fevers and chills, as well as occasional profound depression. As a result, interferon is contraindicated in severely depressed or suicidal patients. Although interferon is not a cure for hepatitis, it is recommended to slow the progression of cirrhotic liver disease in some patients. Pegylated interferon is a longer-acting form of interferon.  \nAnswer A is incorrect . IV immunoglobulin is an engineered antibody that is used to clear the serum of protein products. It often is used in treatment of autoimmune diseases such as Guillain-Barré syndrome. Adverse effects include flu-like reaction and anaphylactic reaction.  \nAnswer B is incorrect . Lamivudine is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor used in the treatment of HIV and HBV. Its principal adverse effect is hepatotoxicity.  \nAnswer D is incorrect . Ribavirin is an antiviral drug used in the treatment of HCV, respiratory syncytial virus, and, occasionally, other viral illnesses. It is not associated with depression or a flu-like reaction.  \nAnswer E is incorrect . Tumor necrosis factor-α is a cytokine involved in the antiviral and antitumor response. It is not used currently as a treatment for HCV.",

Gram-negative organisms are common and likely to contaminate the wound with such a severe laceration injury. The organism grew rapidly on all three culture media used (BA， Choc BA， and MAC). It was oxidase positive， non-lactose fermenting， mucoid， and beta-hemolytic on sheep BA. It did not require high salt concentration to grow， making certain Vibrio organisms (those that need high， 6.5% salt concentration) unlikely. The sensitivity pattern is also useful . The organism turned out to be sensitive to the two agents originally recommended (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and cefuroxime). The child was unable to take the antibiotics because of persistent nausea.\n\n【27】Differential diagnosis\n\n【28】Our differential diagnoses at the onset were Aeromonas or Pleisiomonas， more likely than Vibrio， because of the fresh water or brackish water environment where the injury occurred. The luxuriant growth in all three media was in keep-ing with the differential diagnoses chosen.\n\n【29】·Final diagnosis： Aeromonas hydrophila\n\n【30】Some data from the literature on Aeromonas are shown in Table 1.1a and given below.\n\n【31】Sites of isolation of Aeromonas (environmental reservoirs) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>\n\n【32】· Fresh water\n\n【33】· Estuarine (brackish) water\n\n【34】Table 1.1a Organisms associated with soft tissue infection following water exposure.\n\n| Organisms  | Exposure  | Clinical syndromes  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Aeromonas spp\\  | Fresh water  | Rapidly developing infection associated  |\n|  |  | with fever； sepsis  |\n| Edwardsiella tarda\\  | Fresh water  | Cellulitis， occasionally fulminant  |\n|  |  | infection with bacteremia  |\n| Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae  | Puncture wounds from  | Indolent localized cutaneous eruption；  |\n|  | shrimp， crabs， and fish  | erysipeloid  |\n| Vibrio vulnificus\\  | Salt or brackish water  | Rapidly progressive necrotizing  |\n|  |  | infection； bullous cellulitis； sepsis  |\n| Mycobacterium marinum  | Salt or fresh water including  | Indolent infection； papules progressing  |\n|  | fish tanks  | to shallow ulcers； ascending lesions  |\n|  |  | may resemble sporotrichosis  |\n\n【36】\\Infection associated with patients with underlying liver disease， iron overload syndromes， and cancer； infections in these high-risk groups are particularly fulminant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n删除21：<u>Reproduced with permission of UpToDate from Baddour 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.</u>\n· Surface water， especially recreational\n\n【37】· Drinking water， including treated， well， and bottled\n\n【38】· Polluted waters\n\n【39】·Waste water effluent sludge The organism grows at a range of temperatures from 0°C to 42C.\n\n【40】Characterization and classification of Aeromonas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>\n\n【41】· Aeromonads are ubiquitous inhabitants of fresh and brackish water.\n\n【42】·They have also been recovered from chlorinated tap water， including hospital water supplies.\n\n【43】·They occasionally cause soft tissue infections and sepsis in immunocompro-mised hosts and increasingly have been associated with diarrheal disease.\n\n【44】· Because of recent phylogenetic studies， Aeromonas species have been moved from the family Vibrionaceae to a new family， the Aeromonadaceae.\n\n【45】Microbiologic identification of Aeromonas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u>\n\n【46】·Oxidase-positive， polar flagella， glucose fermenter， facultative anaerobic GNR.\n\n【47】· Resistant to the vibriostatic agent O/129， and unable to grow in 6.5% NaCl.\n\n【48】· Hemolysis is variable but most are beta-hemolytic on BA media.\n\n【49】· There are a few useful standard biochemical tests (A. hydrophila is catalase pos-itive and motile， converts nitrate to nitrite， and is urease negative).\n\n【50】Antimicrobial susceptibility tests of motile Aeromonas spp 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>\n\n【51】·Most strains are resistant to penicillin， ampicillin， carbenicillin， and ticarcillin.\n\n【52】· Most are susceptibleeto second- and third-generation cephalosporins， aminoglycosides， (carbapenems)， chloramphenicol， tetracyclines， trimetho-prim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX)， and fluoroquinolones.

        "text": "【0】Question: A 21-year-old woman presents to her male family practitioner complaining of sleep deprivation and severe depression. When asked about her sleeping habits in greater depth, she reports sleeping for seven-nine hours per night, but states that it is “just not right.” In addition, she later claims to not have any problems with her personal life and is happy and excited about her recent promotion. Throughout the course of the visit, the patient becomes progressively more animated and begins making aggressive sexual advances toward the physician and the staff. She reports that her mood has been good, but not overly elevated, expansive, or elated. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【1】> (A) Bipolar disorder type I\n\n【2】> (B) Histrionic personality disorder\n\n【3】> (C) Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder\n\n【4】> (D) Paranoid personality disorder\n\n【5】> (E) Schizotypal personality disorder\n\n【6】 Answer: The correct answer is B. Histrionic personality disorder is one of the cluster B personality disorders (the “wild” group) that presents early in adulthood. It is best characterized as a pattern of excessive emotionality and attention seeking, and it is often accompanied by somatoform disorders (somatization is a process by which an individual uses his or her body or symptoms for a range of psychologic purposes and gains). An especially important characteristic to remember about histrionic personality disorder is the often overtly sexual nature of those affected. Relationships with physicians in particular are affected by the patient’s attention-seeking behavior, as is evident in this case by the patient reporting both sleep deprivation and depression without objective signs of either.  \nAnswer A is incorrect. Type 1 bipolar disorder is characterized by manic episodes (periods of elevated or irritable mood that must last at least one week) as well as depressive syndromes and mixed syndromes. Sleep of seven-nine hours per night is not usually consistent with a manic syndrome.  \nAnswer C is incorrect. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is characterized by an excessive preoccupation with control, order, and perfectionism. This patient presents none of these characteristics.  \nAnswer D is incorrect. Paranoid personality disorder is characterized by the inherent belief that the world is a dangerous and threatening place. Upon meeting these individuals they often project strength and capability, and their distrust and suspiciousness of everyone is evident. These individuals tend to believe in various conspiracy theories.  \nAnswer E is incorrect. Schizotypal personality disorder is characterized by interpersonal awkwardness, odd beliefs or magical thinking, and an eccentric appearance.",

She remembers eating undercooked shrimp.\n\n【8】• Most likely etiologic agent: Vibrio cholerae .\n\n【9】• Cause of the diarrhea: Hypersecretion of water and electrolytes into the intestinal lumen caused by cholera toxin.\n\n【10】### CLINICAL CORRELATION\n\n【11】The first priorities as with any patient are the “ABCs”: airway, breathing, and circulation. This patient is in hypovolemic shock, meaning insufficient circulation to maintain tissue perfusion needs. The most important step in intervention is volume repletion, usually with intravenous isotonic saline solution. A likely therapy would be 3 L of normal saline intravenously.\n\n【12】Vibrio species are found in saltwater and infections usually occur in the spring and summer. Transmission is by either consumption of contaminated shellfish or traumatic injury associated with infected water. The disease cholera is caused by toxigenic strains of V. cholerae (01 and 0139 serotypes). V. cholerae is spread by ingestion of contaminated water or food. The organism is sensitive to gastric acid; therefore, the dose required to cause an infection is high. Conditions that reduce gastric acid, such as antacid medications or achlorhydria, increase the risk of infection.\n\n【13】The hallmark of cholera is severe watery diarrhea with mild to severe dehydration because of production of toxin by the organism. In cases of severe dehydration, patients have a nonpalpable pulse and very low blood pressure. Fever is usually not present. Patients may become obtunded with sunken eyes and dry mucous membranes.\n\n【14】V. parahaemolyticus is associated with gastroenteritis that is self-limited even though patients present with explosive watery diarrhea, with abdominal pain and with fever. The disease rarely progressed to the severity of dehydration of V. cholerae. V. vulnificus is more often associated with wound infections, ie, cellulitis, rather than gastroenteritis. In patients who abuse alcohol or those with other underlying liver disease, the organism can become disseminated and be associated with a high mortality rate.\n\n【15】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【16】#### Suspected Vibrio Infection\n\n【17】### OBJECTIVES\n\n【18】1\\. Know the structure, physiology, and virulence factors of V. cholerae .\n\n【19】2\\. Know the reservoirs and mechanisms of spread of V. cholerae and the mechanism of action of the cholera toxin in causing disease.\n\n【20】### DEFINITIONS\n\n【21】AZOTEMIA: Buildup in the blood of nitrogenous end products of protein metabolism\n\n【22】OBTUNDED: Loss or dulling of sensations\n\n【23】### DISCUSSION\n\n【24】Characteristics of Vibrio\n\n【25】Vibrio species are motile, curved, gram-negative bacilli with a single polar flagellum. They are facultative anaerobic organisms. Their natural environment is saltwater, where they can multiply freely, and they have been found in shellfish and plankton. The major human pathogens are V. parahaemolyticus, V. vulnificus , and V. cholerae .\n\n【26】More than 200 serotypes of V. cholerae have been identified, based on their O antigen serogroup. Serotype O1 has been responsible for the major cholera pandemics of the past 200 years, but serotype O139 has been identified as contributing to disease since 1992.\n\n【27】The major virulence of this organism is its enterotoxin. The toxin consists of 5 B subunits, which bind to mucosal cell receptors and allow for release of the single A subunit into the cell. The A subunit activates adenyl cyclase, resulting in the hypersecretion of water, sodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate into the intestinal lumen.\n\n【28】Bacteria that survive transit through the stomach can colonize the upper small intestine. Colonization pili facilitate attachment to the intestinal mucosa. The volume of the secreted fluid and electrolytes can overwhelm the gastrointestinal tract’s ability to reabsorb them, resulting in large volumes of watery diarrhea. The loss of an isotonic, bicarbonate-containing fluid results in dehydration, hypovolemia, metabolic acidosis, hemoconcentration, and hypokalemia.\n\n【29】### DIAGNOSIS\n\n【30】The presumptive diagnosis of Vibrio disease can be made after history of association with saltwater either involving trauma or consumption of raw shellfish. The watery diarrhea associated with V. parahaemolyticus cannot be easily distinguished clinically from other forms of bacterial gastroenteritis. Cellulitis caused by V. vulnificus should be diagnosed rapidly to avoid mortality. History of recent exposure to seawater is helpful in making a presumptive diagnosis.\n\n【31】The diagnosis of cholera should be suspected in those with severe diarrheal illness who live in or have traveled to an endemic area. Diagnosis of Vibrio infection can be confirmed by culturing stool or wound samples. Gram stain of wound or blood cultures may demonstrate a characteristic curved appearance to the gram-negative bacilli.\n\n【32】Most of the Vibrio species require salt for growth and therefore specialized media, such as thiosulfate citrate bile salts sucrose (TCBS) agar. Most of the Vibrio species will grow on blood agar and may appear β-hemolytic, but poor growth is seen on MacConkey agar. V. cholerae appear as yellow colonies, and V. parahaemolyticus and V. vulnificus appear as green colonies on TCBS agar.\n\n【33】### TREATMENT AND PREVENTION\n\n【34】The treatment of cholera involves volume replacement with isotonic, bicarbonate-containing fluids, either using oral rehydration solutions in mild to moderate dehydration or intravenous fluids, such as Ringer lactate, in the profoundly dehydrated or those unable to tolerate oral intake. Oral antibiotics can be given to kill the bacteria and decrease the duration of the illness, but they do not take away the need for appropriate rehydration therapy. The most commonly administered antimicrobial is doxycycline.\n\n【35】Treatment with antimicrobials is not usually needed for gastroenteritis caused by V. parahaemolyticus . Wound infections or bacteremia caused by V. vulnificus require rapid administration of antimicrobials such as tetracycline or a quinolones. Prevention of cholera includes improvement of hygienic practices, including treatment of the potable water supply with either heat or chlorine and ensuring thorough cooking of seafood. Research is ongoing to perfect a vaccine to prevent cholera.\n\n【36】###",

Her history is unremarkable except for a wrist fracture after a fall onto her right hand 2 years ago that was fixed with open reduction internal fixation. Her postoperative course was uncomplicated. Physical examination in the office reveals a well-healed surgical incision on the volar aspect of her wrist， normal grip strength， and no sensory deficits.

The palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve is given off approxi-mately 5 cm proximally to the carpal tunnel in most patients. This explains why patients with carpal tunnel syndrome typically have sparing of sensa-tion of the thenar/palmar aspect of the affected hand. The motor fibers of the median nerve branch off distally to the tunnel， and as a result， patients may exhibit weakness and/or atrophy of the thenar musculature. The 9 flexor ten-dons of FDP， FDS， and FPL are all contained within the carpal tunnel.\n\n【17】29.2 D. The patient in this question does exhibit symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. However， her history and physical exam also point strongly to undiagnosed hypothyroidism. Further workup and treatment of her meta-bolic condition should be performed before intervention of her carpal tunnel symptoms.\n\n【18】29.3D. Distal radius fractures and subsequent fixation are associated with a num-ber of potential complications， including iatrogenic carpal tunnel syndrome of variable severity. In this case， the patient does have postoperative symptoms that are consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome， but they are mild and inter-mittent. Acute or emergency carpal tunnel release is not indicated. There are no signs of infection or refracture， and cast immobilization may exacerbate her symptoms. MRI of the wrist would not likely provide any new information. The correct choice would be conservative management with close follow-up to monitor for change in symptoms.\n\n【19】CLINICALPEARLS\n\n【20】The carpal tunnel is an effectively closed space， containing the median nerve， among other structures. Any reduction in volume of this finite space can lead to increased pressure upon， and thus dysfunction of， the median nerve. This results in carpal tunnel syndrome.\n\n【21】Carpal tunnel syndrome is a clinical diagnosis， made by history and physical exam findings； adjunctive tests such as EMG studies may be used to confirm， but never make， the diagnosis.\n\n【22】Other neurologic conditions or injuries may be differentiated from carpal tunnel syndrome by thorough history and physical exam， including exact localization of motor and sensory symptoms.\n\n【23】Conservative management should always be attempted before operative treatment of CTS. If conservative management fails， surgical carpal tunnel release is performed with either open or endoscopic techniques. Both meth-ods are associated with excellent outcomes.",

        "text": "【0】EPIGASTRIC HERNIA\n\n【1】It is an extremely rare condition. It means hernia occurs  删除换行1 through the obturator foramen traversed by the obturator  删除换行1 vessels and nerve. This obturator foramen is wider in  删除换行1 females and that is why it is about 6 times commoner in  删除换行1 women.\n\n【2】Clinical features.— Most of the patients are old  删除换行1 women above 60 years of age who have lost considerable  删除换行1 fat.\n\n【3】The condition is difficult to diagnose, since the swelling  删除换行1 is covered by the pectineus and no definite swelling can  删除换行1 be seen even in the Scarpa’s triangle. The hernia becomes  删除换行1 only apparent when the limb is flexed, abducted and  删除换行1 rotated outwards. The patient usually keeps the limb in  删除换行1 the semiflexed position and movements increase pain.\n\n【4】Obturator hernia often gets strangulated as it comes  删除换行1 out through an opening surrounded by osseoaponeurosis.\nIn about V2 the cases of strangulation, pain is referred  删除换行1 along the obturator nerve to the knee joint of the  删除换行1 corresponding side by its articulate branch.\n\n【5】Only rectal or vaginal examination can detect the  删除换行1 tender swelling in the region of the obturator foramen.\n\n【6】Richter’s hernia is quite common.\n\n【7】Treatment.-— Operation should always be performed  删除换行1 as strangulation is very common.\n\n【8】Abdominal approach is usually preferred by lower  删除换行1 paramedian incision as the condition is often discovered  删除换行1 only after laparotomy which has been performed for  删除换行1 intestinal obstruction. The obturator foramen is widened  删除换行1 and the hernia is pulled in after the abdomen has been  删除换行1 properly mopped to prevent contamination from the toxic  删除换行1 fluid of the hernial sac. The obturator vessels are always  删除换行1 vulnerable of being injured. If the hernia cannot be  删除换行1 released from the abdomen or the diagnosis has been made  删除换行1 before operation, the femoral approach may be employed.\n\n【9】Femoral approach.— A vertical incision is made  删除换行1 extending downwards from the inguinal ligament 2 cm  删除换行1 medial to the femoral vessels. The adductor longus is  删除换行1 retracted medially. The pectineus muscle is separated or  删除换行1 divided to expose the obturator externus. The hernial sac 删除换行1 is usually found lying on the surface of this muscle having  删除换行1 emerged along its superior border. The sac and the  删除换行1 contents are dealt with in the similar manner as  删除换行1 strangulated hernia and herniorrhaphy is performed by  删除换行1 repairing the gap in the obturator foramen.\n\n【10】INCISIONAL HERNIA\n\n【11】This hernia extrudes out through  删除换行1 the greater sciatic foramen either above or below the  删除换行1 piriformis muscle.\n\n【12】This hernia occurs through the lesser  删除换行1 sciatic foramen. In the differential diagnosis of gluteal  删除换行1 and sciatic herniae one should remember (i) a cold abscess, 删除换行1 (ii) a lipoma, (iii) a gluteal aneurysm, (iv) fibrosarcoma  删除换行1 beneath the gluteus maximus.\n\n【13】It is a type of interparietal hernia  删除换行1 occurring at the level of the arcuate line just lateral to  删除换行1 the rectus muscle.\n\n【14】The extraperitoneal fat alongwith the hernial sac lies  删除换行1 just deep to the internal oblique muscle or may advance  删除换行1 to reach the gap between the external and internal oblique  删除换行1 muscles. Only a slight swelling can be detected.\n\n【15】Treatment.— Operation is the treatment. Incision is  删除换行1 made on the swelling just lateral to the rectus muscle.\nAfter incising skin and subcutaneous tissue, external  删除换行1 aponeurosis is split to expose the hernial sac. The sac is  删除换行1 isolated, the contents are reduced. The sac is ligated and  删除换行1 excised. The transversus and oblique muscles are repaired.\n\n【16】In this case hernia occurs through  删除换行1 the pelvic floor. It is extremely rare and occasionally seen  删除换行1 in —\n\n【17】(i) Postoperative hernia through the perineal scar  删除换行1 following excision of rectum.\n\n【18】(ii) Pudendal hernia when the hernia occurs as a  删除换行1 swelling of the labium majus.\n\n【19】(iii) Ischiorectal hernia, in which the hernia passes  删除换行1 through the levator ani or through hiatus of Schwalbe  删除换行1 into the ischiorectal fossa.CHAPTER\n\n【20】TESTIS, EPIDIDYMIS\n\n【21】AND SCROTUM 18\n\n【22】CLINICAL FEATURES.—\nTestis develops in the lumbar region from the  删除换行1 thickened epithelium on the medial side of the  删除换行1 mesonephric ridge in the 5th week. This thickened  删除换行1 epithelium continues to proliferate displacing the  删除换行1 mesonephros in a dorsilateral direction and forming a  删除换行1 projection into the coelomic cavity, which is termed the  删除换行1 genital ridge. Upto the 7th week the genital gland  删除换行1 possesses no differentiating feature. The proliferating  删除换行1 epithelium on the surface sends a number of cellular cords  删除换行1 inwards which are known as testis cords. At the 7th week a  删除换行1 mesenchyme cuts off the testis cord from the surface and  删除换行1 forms the tunica albuginea. At this stage one can  删除换行1 differentiate between testis (where tunica albuginea is  删除换行1 prominently present) and ovary (where tunica albuginea  删除换行1 is absent). The testis cords encroach on the medulla where  删除换行1 they unite with the network derived from the  删除换行1 mesenchyme and becomes rete testis. The premordial germ  删除换行1 cells are incorporated in the cords (testis cords), which  删除换行1 later become enlarged and canalised to form the  删除换行1 seminiferous tubules. The cells derived from the surface of  删除换行1 the gonad form the supporting cells of Sertoli. The  删除换行1 interstitial cells of the testis are derived from the  删除换行1 mesenchyme which do not become incorporated into the  删除换行1 tubules. The cords of the rete testis canalise at a later  删除换行1 stage and become connected to the mesonephric duct by  删除换行1 5 to 12 most cephalic of the persisting tubules and these  删除换行1 become exceedingly convoluted and form the lobules of 删除换行1 the head of the epididymis. The mesonephric duct becomes  删除换行1 the canal of the epididymis and the ductus deferens of the 删除换行1 testis.\n\n【23】DESCENT OF THE TESTIS.— At first, the testis lies  删除换行1 on the dorsum of the abdominal wall. Mesenchymal cells  删除换行1 form a cord which extends from that part of the skin  删除换行1 which later forms the scrotum, through the inguinal fold  删除换行1 to the lower pole of the testis. This cord later becomes a  删除换行1 fibromuscular bundle and is termed the gubernaculum 删除换行1 testis. It traverses the site of the future inguinal canal,  删除换行1 which is formed around it by the muscles of the  删除换行1 abdominal wall as they become differentiated. The testis  删除换行1 descends along the path of the gubernaculum whether or  删除换行1 not due to pull of it. A fold of peritoneum protrudes 删除换行1 down the inguinal canal along with the testis forming  删除换行1 the processus vaginalis. The lower pole of the testis is kept  删除换行1 in apposition with the deep inguinal ring by the  删除换行1 gubernaculum until the 7th month. Suddenly the testis  删除换行1 passes through the inguinal canal and gains the scrotum.\nAs it descends, it is necessarily accompanied by its  删除换行1 peritoneal covering and by a fold of peritoneum from the  删除换行1 adjoining peritoneum from the iliac fossa which is drawn  删除换行1 down as the processus vaginalis as also its blood vessels  删除换行1 and nerve supply. The peritoneal covering of the testis  删除换行1 which represents the distal end of the processus vaginalis  删除换行1 and into which the testis projects, is termed the tunica 删除换行1 vaginalis testis. The part of the processus vaginalis which  删除换行1 is associated with the spermatic cord in the inguinal canal  删除换行1 normally becomes obliterated. The fascial covering of the  删除换行1 testis and spermatic cord including the Cremaster are  删除换行1 developed from the surrounding structures as the testis  删除换行1 descends.\n\n【24】Time-table of testicular descent.—\n\n【25】In the lumbar region in the 2nd month of foetal life.\n\n【26】In the iliac fossa — 3rd month of foetal life.\n\n【27】At the deep inguinal ring — till the 7th month.\n\n【28】Travels the inguinal canal — in the 7th month.\n\n【29】At the superficial inguinal ring — at the later part of  删除换行1 the 7th month or 8th month.\n\n【30】Scrotum (its final position) — testis enters the scrotum  删除换行1 in the 9th month.\n\n【31】Factors which cause descent of testis.—\n\n【32】(i) Shortening and active contraction of the  删除换行1 gubernaculum.\n\n【33】(ii) Increased intra-abdominal pressure.\n\n【34】(iii) Active contraction of the lower fibres of the internal oblique muscles which squeezes the testis through  删除换行1 the canal.\n\n【35】(iv) Higher temperature of the abdominal cavity,  删除换行1 which is detrimental to spermatogenesis.\n\n【36】(v) Hormone, specially Chorionic gonadotrophin  删除换行1 from the maternal circulation helps descent of the testis.\n\n【37】Causes of undescended testis.—\n\n【38】(i) Abnormality of the gubernaculum testis.— \n\n【39】Gubernaculum plays a major role in descent of testis and  删除换行1 abnormality of this structure may result in undescended 删除换行1 testis.\n\n【40】(ii) Intrinsic testicular defect.— The testis may be 删除换行1 insensitive to gonadotrophins and may not act to it. This  删除换行1 may lead to undescended testis.\n\n【41】(iii) Deficient 删除换行1 gonadotrophic hormonal 删除换行1 stimulation.— Lack of  删除换行1 adequate maternal  删除换行1 gonadotrophins may  删除换行1 be a cause of incomplete  删除换行1 descent.\n\n【42】(iv) Obstruction  删除换行1 due to adhesions of the  删除换行1 testis.\n\n【43】(v) Short vas  删除换行1 deferens.\n\n【44】(vi) Short testicular vessels or  删除换行1 pampiniform plexus.\n\n【45】3rd Month\n\n【46】Beginning;  删除换行1 of 7th Month!\n\n【47】7 th Month, 删除换行1 8 th Month 删除换行1 9 th Month\n\n【48】©-2nd Month 删除换行4 (vii) Imperfectly developed testis interferes with its  删除换行1 own descent.\n删除3：<u>Fig.18.1.— Shows the time-table of  删除换行1 testicular descent. See the text.</u>\nHISTORY.—\nAn undescended testis is one which has failed to  删除换行1 descend to the scrotum and is retained at any point along  删除换行1 the normal path of its descent. About 30% of premature  删除换行1 male babies have undescended testes. For full term infants,  删除换行1 the incidence is 4%. Spontaneous descent occurs in most  删除换行1 of these by 1 year of age, when the incidence of  删除换行1 undescended testis is 0.8%.\n\n【49】Undescended testis is more common on the right side  删除换行1 (50%). It is less common on the left side (30%). In about  删除换行1 20% cases it is bilateral. When both the testes are absent  删除换行1 in the scrotum, the condition is called cryptorchidism 删除换行1 (Hidden testes).\n\n【50】Cryptorchidism.— This term is derived from the \n\n【51】Greek word ‘cryptos’, which means hidden.When both  删除换行1 testes are impalpable the condition is known as  删除换行1 cryptorchidism or hidden testes. As the right testis descends  删除换行1 later than the left testis, undescended testis is more  删除换行1 common on the right side.\n\n【52】Anorchism.— Complete agenesis of testis is known as  删除换行1 anorchism. One testis may fail to develop occsionally in  删除换行1 association with ipsilateral agenesis of kidney and ureter.\nThis is known as monorchism and is seen more often on  删除换行1 the right side and is termed 'right-sided syndrome’. There  删除换行1 are cases who exhibit no evidence of viable testicular tissue,  删除换行1 though the external genitalia are fully differentiated in  删除换行1 masculine configuration. Such persons are apparently  删除换行1 normal males, though with a completely empty scrotum.\nPuberty is delayed and incomplete with inadequate  删除换行1 plasma testosterone levels and with persistent elevation 删除换行1 of gonadotrophin levels. It is postulated that such persons  删除换行1 with complete anorchism did have normal testes at early  删除换行1 stage of gestation, but sometime after the 16th week of  删除换行1 foetal life the testes atrophied possibly due to mechanical  删除换行1 torsion or interference with testicular blood supply in  删除换行1 the course of descent. A gratifying therapeutic response  删除换行1 to continuing exogenous testosterone therapy will be  删除换行1 observed with sexual maturity, increased libido, masculine  删除换行1 distribution of body fat and muscle mass.\n\n【53】(i) Growth of the testis.— It is clear now that scrotal  删除换行1 temperture is at least 1°C cooler than the abdominal  删除换行1 temperature, Proper development of spermatogenic  删除换行1 tubules cannot take place in abdominal cavity. As a result  删除换行1 the spermatogenic tubules are of diminished size and  删除换行1 fewer spermatogonia have been detected in undescended  删除换行1 testis in boys at about 6 years of age.\n\n【54】Histologically the epithelial elements are grossly  删除换行1 immature and by the age of 16 years irreversible  删除换行1 destructive changes have occurred which halt  删除换行1 spermatogenesis and limit the production of androgens  删除换行1 to around half of the normal output.\n\n【55】After 6 years of age, changes become more obvious.\nThe diameter of the tubules is smaller than normal. The  删除换行1 number of spermatogonia decreases. Fibrosis is noticed  删除换行1 between the tubules.\n\n【56】After puberty, the difference is obvious and the  删除换行1 undescended testis is much smaller and flabby than the  删除换行1 normal intrascrotal testis. The undescended testis is hardly  删除换行1 more than 1/2 the size of its intrascrotal counterpart.\n\n【57】(ii) Internal secretory function.—- Fortunately the \n\n【58】Leydig cells are not affected by body temperature and  删除换行1 are therefore usually found in normal numbers in  删除换行1 undescended testis. So secondary sex characters appear  删除换行1 and endocrinologic cause of impotence is rare in this  删除换行1 group. However in bilateral cryptorchidism, androgen  删除换行1 level is diminished to certain extent.\n\n【59】(iii) Epididymis remains separated from the testis with  删除换行1 a long mesorchium, which is the primitive mesogenitale  删除换行1 which connects the genital fold to the mesonephros. So  删除换行1 torsion of testis is more common in these cases.\n\n【60】(iv) Sometimes an undescended testis is associated  删除换行1 with a hernial sac. In a series about 90% of cases of  删除换行1 undescended testes were associated with patent processus  删除换行1 vaginalis.\n\n【61】(v) Undescended testis may be associated with other  删除换行1 urinary tract abnormalities.\n\n【62】(vi) Chance of malignancy is more in undescended  删除换行1 testis. The chance is more if the undescended testis  删除换行1 presents in a patient of 10 years of age or older and many  删除换行1 surgeons recommend orchidectomy for unilateral  删除换行1 undescended testis at this age group rather than 删除换行1 orchidopexy.\n\n【63】Types of undescended testis.—\n\n【64】(a) Intra-abdominal.— The testis remains  删除换行1 extraperitoneally or retroperitoneally deep within the  删除换行1 pelvis or just above the deep inguinal ring or it may even  删除换行1 be located anywhere within the lower abdomen.\n\n【65】(b) Inguinal.— The testis is in the inguinal canal. The  删除换行1 testis may or may not be palpable.\n\n【66】(c) In the superficial inguinal pouch the testis frequently  删除换行1 comes to rest just outside the superficial inguinal ring in  删除换行1 the superficial fascia. This testis must be differentiated  删除换行1 from the much more common retractile testis, which also  删除换行1 lies often in the same position.\n\n【67】(d) lumbar testis.— Complete failure of descent and  删除换行1 the testis remains where it was developed.\n\n【68】(e) Iliac testis.— Testis is just deep to the deep inguinal  删除换行1 ring.\n\n【69】(f) At the superficial inguinal ring.— The testis  删除换行1 frequently comes to rest just outside the external inguinal  删除换行1 ring.\n\n【70】(g) Scrotal testis.— The testis lies in the upper part of  删除换行1 the scrotum. It is often a retractile testis due to contraction of overactive cremaster muscle. In this case the scrotal sac is of normal size. The testis is also of normal size.\nThe testis can also be brought down to the scrotum.\n\n【71】ON EXAMINATION.—\n\n【72】Age.— Undescended testes are usually noticed in  删除换行1 children, but are occasionally not noticed until  删除换行1 adolescence or even adult life.\n\n【73】TREATMENT.—\n\n【74】(i) Obviously absence of one or both testes from the  删除换行1 scrotum is the commonest presenting symptom. In fact  删除换行1 the child or the parent first notices that the scrotum is not 删除换行1 developed, rather than absence of testis within it.\n\n【75】(ii) Occasionally patients present in adult life with  删除换行1 infertility, though secondary sex characteristics, are usually  删除换行1 normal.\n\n【76】(iii) In a small proportion of cases patients present  删除换行1 with indirect inguinal hernia i.e. a swelling in the groin,  删除换行1 along with undescended testis.",

He also has a CD4 count of 50 cells/mm <sup>3 </sup> (normal range: 500–1000 cells/mm <sup>3 </sup> ). He has had a fever of 101°F (38.3°C) for a few weeks and “feels tired all the time.” He has no other symptoms, and findings on physical examination are normal. CBC, urinalysis, and chest radiography are normal. Bone marrow biopsy reveals granulomas, and a culture grows an organism that is a budding yeast at 98.6°F (37°C) but produces hyphae and tuberculated chlamydospores at 77°F (25°C). Of the following, which is the most likely cause?\n\n【1】A. Aspergillus fumigatus\n\n【2】B. Coccidioides immitis\n\n【3】C. Cryptococcus neoformans\n\n【4】D. Histoplasma capsulatum\n\n【5】E. Mucor species\n\n【6】Answer: 40.1 D. An individual who is HIV-positive may have normal immune capacity, as measured by laboratory parameters, but will still be more at risk for opportunistic organisms. Respiratory infections may have been caused by fungi, bacteria, or viruses. As a result, laboratory results may be crucial in determining the exact organism causing an infection. In this case, bone marrow biopsy revealed a budding yeast form at 98.6°F (37°C), but hyphae and tuberculated chlamydospores at room temperature (77°F \\[25°C\\]). In disseminated histoplasmosis, bone marrow cultures are often positive. Tuberculate macroconidia are characteristic for the mycelial form of H. capsulatum .\n\n【7】Question: 40.2 A 4-year-old girl who lives in California has had a low-grade fever. Skin tests performed for the first time give the following results:\n\n【8】The test results suggest which of the following?\n\n【9】A. The patient has been exposed to C. immitis .\n\n【10】B. The patient has been immunized against C. immitis .\n\n【11】C. The patient has had scarlet fever.\n\n【12】D. The patient has IgG antibody to Mycobacterium tuberculosis .\n\n【13】E. The patient has immunity to Corynebacterium diphtheriae .\n\n【14】Answer: 40.2 A. The Dick and Schick tests relate to streptococcal/corynebacterial infections, specifically scarlet fever and diphtheria, respectively. The young girl has been exposed to Mycobacterium , most likely M. tuberculosis , but the positive reaction observed is based on a cellular immune reaction, not one mediated by antibodies. The location is a region where Coccidioides is endemic and should be one of the suspected pathogens to be considered. No vaccine is available for C. immitis . Therefore, a positive coccidioidin test indicates that the young girl has been exposed to the agent and has developed a cellular immune reaction in response.\n\n【15】Question: 40.3 A 50-year-old immunocompromised woman is diagnosed as having meningitis. A latex agglutination test on the spinal fluid for capsular polysaccharide antigen is positive. Of the following organisms, which one is the most likely cause?\n\n【16】A. Aspergillus fumigatus\n\n【17】B. Cryptococcus neoformans\n\n【18】C. Histoplasma capsulatum\n\n【19】D. Nocardia asteroides\n\n【20】E. Toxoplasma gondii\n\n【21】Answer: 40.3 B. Cryptococcus neoformans is yeast characterized by a thick polysaccharide capsule. It occurs worldwide in nature and in very large numbers in pigeon feces. Cryptococcus infection is usually associated with immunosuppression. Tests for capsular antigen can be performed on cerebrospinal fluid and serum. The latex agglutination test for cryptococcal antigen is positive in 90% of patients with cryptococcal meningitis (meaning a sensitivity rate of 90%). With effective treatment (amphotericin B and possibly flucytosine), the antigen titer usually drops, except in patients with AIDS.\n\n【22】Question: 40.4 Which of the following is the most common portal of entry in B. dermatitidis infection?\n\n【23】A. Genitourinary tract\n\n【24】B. Lymphatic system\n\n【25】C. Mouth\n\n【26】D. Respiratory tract\n\n【27】E. Skin\nAnswer: 40.4 D. B. dermatitidis grows as a mold culture, producing septate hyphae and conidia. In a host, it converts to a large, singly budding yeast cell. It is endemic in North America. Human infection is initiated in the lungs. Diagnosis may be difficult because no skin (despite the name, which probably comes from the fact that it can spread to cutaneous disease in late stages) or serologic tests exist. Chronic pneumonia is a common presentation. Sputum, pus, exudates, urine, and lung biopsy material can be examined microscopically, looking for thick walled yeast cells with broadly attached buds. It may also be cultured.\n\n【28】MICROBIOLOGY PEARLS\n\n【29】 C. immitis is a dimorphic, systemic fungus, commonly found in the soil of arid areas.\n\n【30】 Most patients exposed to the arthroconidia of C. immitis develop an asymptomatic or respiratory infection. Disseminated disease occurs rarely in severely immunosuppressed patients.\n\n【31】 Person-to-person transmission of C. immitis is not known to occur.",

Unfortunately， only a minority of patients with adrenal incidentalomas undergo appropriate workup. Although Cushing syndrome (CS) is asso-ciated with physical and metabolic changes，approxi-mately half of patients with adrenal CS are diagnosed incidentally， suggesting poor recognition of CS in the clinical practice. Undiagnosed CS may present with abnormal menses and infertility.2 During pregnancy， unrecognized and untreated CS may be associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes.3.4\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 41-year-old woman presented for evaluation of an adrenal mass. After searching online for a rea-son for her symptoms， she came across a descrip-tion of “Cushing syndrome\" and requested further workup. She reported a 5-year history of progres-sive muscle weakness， weight gain， episodes of dia-phoresis， and menstrual irregularity. Over the prior2 years， she developed moon facies， dorsocervical and supraclavicular pads， erythema， insomnia， dif-ficulty concentrating， and an increase in anxiety and depression. She was diagnosed with new onset hypertension and dyslipidemia 2 years ago. Over-all， she gained 50 pounds over the prior 5 years， and 20 pounds in the prior 2 years.\n\n【5】Several years ago， after unsuccessfully attempt-ing to conceive for 12 months， she pursued fertility therapy. During pregnancy， she developed gesta-tional diabetes that necessitated insulin therapy.\n\n【6】Otherwise， her medical history was positive for nephrolithiasis. Two years prior an abdominal com-puted tomography (CT)scan wasperformed that described a 3-cm right adrenal mass. No hormonal workup was performed at that time.\n\n【7】Her current medications included carvedilol、losar-tan， sertraline， and alprazolam. On physical examina-tion， her blood pressure was 138/88 mmHg and body mass index was 46.64 kg/m2. She had no striae or proximal myopathy but did have a dorsocervical pad， supraclavicular pads， and rounding and erythema of the face. She had minimal edema of the lower extremities.\n\n【8】INVESTIGATIONS\n\n【9】Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen that was per-formed recently was reviewed and compared to the CT performed 2 years prior. The most recent CT demon-strated a stable 3.3×2.1×3.1-cm right adrenal mass删除33：<u></u>. The left adrenal gland was atrophic. Hor-monal workup for hypercortisolism was performed， including morning measurement of ACTH and dehy-droepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S)， 1-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test (DST)， and 24-hour urinary free cortisol excretion. The laboratory data were consistent with ACTH-independent hypercorti-solism . Laparoscopic adrenalectomy was recommended.\n\n【10】TREATMENT\n\n【11】The patient was treated with a laparoscopic right adrenalectomy at an institution other than ours， with pathologic analysis demonstrating an adrenocortical adenoma. She was educated on adrenal insufficiency and initiated on hydrocortisone therapy.\n\n【12】删除3：<u>Fig. 97.1 Axial (below) and coronal (above) images from a contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan showed a 3.3×2.1×3.1-cm right adrenal mass .</u>\n\n【13】The patient presented with unrecognized， progressive ACTH-independent CS of at least 5 years duration. An opportunity for an earlier diagnosis was lost when the incidental discovery of an adrenal mass several years prior was dismissed as not clinically significant， without any workup at that time. Assuming another diagnosis is not obvious (e.g.，pheochromocytoma)， a DST should be performed in all patients with an adrenal mass， regard-less of symptoms of hormone excess. Our patient was diagnosed with overt CS， as she presented with clini-cal features of hypercortisolism on examination (Box C.1). Biochemical workup was consistent with ACTH-independent hypercortisolism with undetectable ACTH and DHEA-S， abnormal DST， and elevated 24-hour urine cortisol. With confirmation of ACTH-indepen-dent hypercortisolism， the unilateral adrenal mass was considered the culprit lesion， and adrenalectomy was\n\n| TABLE 97.1 Laboratory Tests  |\n| --- |\n| Reference Biochemical Test Result Range  |\n| 1-mg overnight DST， 12.4 <1.8 mcg/dL  |\n| Morning cortisol， mcg/dL 13 7-25  |\n| ACTH，pg/mL <5 7.2-63  |\n| DHEA-S， mcg/dL 14 27-240  |\n| Urine free cortisol， “Elevated，”not 3.5-45 mcg/24h repeated at our institution  |\n| Aldosterone，ng/dL 4.4 <21  |\n| Plasma renin activity， ng/ 2.1 2.9-10.8mL per hour  |\n| Plasma metanephrine， <0.20 <0.5 nmo/L  |\n| Plasma normetanephrine。0.38 <0.9nmol/L  |\n\n【15】ACTH.

Adrenal insufficiency andglucocorti-coid withdrawal should be anticipated andproperly treated in these cases .\n\n【17】In retrospect， the patients irregular menses and infertility may have been caused or exacerbated by the undiagnosed and untreated CS.2 A systematic review of the literature reported adrenal CS as the most common CS subtype diagnosed during preg-nancy4 Patients with untreated CS during pregnancy had higher rates of pregnancy-related complications such as gestational diabetes mellitus (37%)， gesta-tional hypertension (41%)， and preeclampsia (26%).4Preterm delivery and low birth weight were the most common adverse fetal outcomes.\nDepending on the severity of CS and gestation week， if diagnosed during pregnancy， conservative manage-ment of comorbidities， antepartum adrenalectomy， or medical therapy can be considered. Metyrapone is the most commonly used medication used for treatment of CS during pregnancy4.5 In-depth monitoring is required in these cases to document optimal therapy of hypercortisolism， prevent or appropriately treat adrenal insufficiency， observe for possible metyrapone-induced side effects of hypertension and hypokalemia， and adapt any ongoing management of hyperglycemia.\n\n【18】Key Points\n\n【19】Workup for ACTH-independent hypercortisolism is recommended in all patients with an adrenal mass， regardless of symptoms.\n\n【20】●Untreated CS is associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes during pregnancy\n\n【21】●Management of CS during pregnancy depends on its severity， etiology， and the gestational stage at diagnosis， and includes conservative management of comorbidities， surgery， or medical therapy.\n删除20：<u>1\\.

He was previously treated with methotrexate resulting in complete clearance of his skin but ultimately discontinued the medication due to liver enzyme elevation, diarrhea, and stomach ache. He was then started on apremilast but discontinued it due to inefficacy. He is unable to try phototherapy due to his work schedule. Review of systems was unremarkable, and the patient has no AIDS-defining conditions.\n\n【14】On physical examination , there were several pink, round plaques with thick white scale on the bilateral upper and lower extremities.

Although the prevalence of psoriasis in the HIV-infected population is similar to that of the general population, psoriasis has a propensity to be more severe and treatment-refractory in patients with concomitant HIV 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Psoriasis in HIV patients may also present at any degree of severity during any stage of the HIV infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. However, more severe psoriasis is correlated with worsening HIV-mediated immunosuppression. Psoriasis may be the first manifestation of HIV infection in some patients. Therefore, those with new-onset psoriasis may benefit from HIV testing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. Psoriasis patients at risk for infection or with treatment-refractory disease may also benefit from HIV testing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】Although HIV-infected patients may present with any subtype of psoriasis, the most common subtypes include plaque, guttate, inverse, and erythrodermic psoriasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Multiple subtypes of psoriasis may be present in the same patient. HIV-positive psoriasis patients are more likely to have significant psoriatic arthritis when compared to HIV-negative psoriasis patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Histological examination of skin specimens from HIV-infected psoriasis patients classically shows elevated plasma cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】Treatment of HIV-infected psoriasis patients poses a unique challenge, as HIV-associated psoriasis is paradoxically a T-lymphocyte mediated disease in the setting of T-lymphocyte depletion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Many psoriasis treatments are immunosuppressive and can potentially lead to severe complications in HIV patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Interestingly, psoriasis may improve in HIV patients that begin antiretroviral therapy and replenish T-lymphocyte counts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】Treatment\n---------\n\n【24】In general, HIV patients with psoriasis should be treated with agents that have minimal to no immunosuppressive properties, which limits the treatment options for these patients. First-line therapy for psoriasis with concomitant HIV includes phototherapy, which lacks systemic properties. Topical agents such as corticosteroids, vitamin D analogues , a combination of corticosteroids and vitamin D analogues (e.g. betamethasone dipropionate with calcipotriol), or topical calcineurin inhibitors may also be used as first-line therapy with or without phototherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Based on the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, any HIV patient, regardless of CD4 count or the presence of an AIDS-defining illness, should start on antiretroviral therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In addition to treating HIV, antiretroviral therapies have been shown to reduce the severity of psoriasis in HIV patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】If phototherapy , topical treatments , and antiretroviral therapies are unsuccessful in treating psoriasis patients with concomitant HIV, second-line treatments include acitretin , apremilast , TNF inhibitors , and ustekinumab 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 8 \\]</u>. However, acitretin may interfere with some antiretroviral drugs. Apremilast, a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, is safe and well-tolerated in psoriasis patients with HIV. Side-effects of apremilast include nausea, diarrhea, weight loss, and upper respiratory tract infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】Biologic agents should be considered in HIV-positive psoriasis patients with refractory psoriasis or debilitating psoriatic arthritis. Specifically, ustekinumab and TNF inhibitors such as etanercept, adalimumab, and infliximab have been deemed safe and effective in psoriasis patients with concomitant HIV in multiple case studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. One case study found that etanercept treatment in a patient with HIV led to complete clearance of pustular psoriasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. In a case study of an HIV-positive psoriasis patient treated with IL-12/23 inhibitor ustekinumab, the patient tolerated the medication well, and his CD4 count increased from 429 cells/mL at baseline to 480 cells/mL 7 months after initiating ustekinumab 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【27】Methotrexate and cyclosporine should be avoided in psoriasis patients with concomitant HIV due to the risk of opportunistic infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Methotrexate may worsen HIV disease severity and may also lead to leucopenia and opportunistic infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Cyclosporine may inhibit activation of CD4 lymphocytes via calcineurin inhibition, which may theoretically be beneficial in HIV patients because T-cell activation is needed for HIV replication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. A number of case reports found that cyclosporine was effective and tolerable in a psoriasis patient with concomitant HIV 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. However, further data supporting the use of cyclosporine in psoriasis with concomitant HIV is limited. Due its known immunosuppressive effects and limited literature supporting its use, cyclosporine should also be avoided in this population.\n\n【28】Psoriasis patients with HIV treated with immunosuppressant medications should be managed in collaboration with infectious disease specialists for monitoring of CD4 counts and viral load and prevention of opportunistic infections. In some cases, infectious disease specialists may recommend prophylaxis to prevent opportunistic infections in these patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】Unfortunately, there are currently no randomized controlled trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of treatments for psoriasis with concomitant HIV. The evidence supporting the use of the aforementioned therapies consist mainly of case reviews and case reports.\n\n【30】The patient was treated with acitretin and topical betamethasone dipropionate alternating with topical tacrolimus. At 3-month follow-up, the patient experienced improvement of his psoriasis lesions, and his total affected BSA was 1%.\n\n【31】Key Points\n----------\n\n【32】   Psoriasis prevalence in HIV patients is similar to that of the general population. However, HIV patients with psoriasis may have more severe and treatment-refractory disease.\n   All HIV patients should start antiretroviral therapy regardless of CD4+ count or presence of AIDS-defining illnesses.\n   First-line treatments for psoriasis with concomitant HIV include phototherapy and topical therapies. Second-line treatments include TNF inhibitors, ustekinumab, acitretin, and apremilast.\n   Methotrexate and cyclosporine should be avoided due to the risk of opportunistic infection.\n\n【33】###",

In the past, her atopic dermatitis was manageable with topical agents alone, but recently, it has generalized to the trunk and all extremities and topical agents are no longer adequate to control her disease. Furthermore, the atopic dermatitis now also involves her face where mild topical steroids have also been inadequate. On examination, typical erythematous, eczematous lesions are observed scattered over the trunk and extremities. There are also patchy areas of excoriations and lichenification. The periorbital region, antecubital fossae and popliteal fossae are also involved. The patient reports that her skin is easily aggravated by various materials she comes in contact with such as wool clothing, soap, and even some moisturizing lotions.\n\n【8】Because of the chronic hyper-irritability of her skin, which is not at all unusual in the atopic dermatitis population, the patient is started on a conservative dose of BB-UVB phototherapy. Her face is also treated while wearing proper eye protection. Despite initiating phototherapy at low dose with precaution, she experiences of symptoms of mild sunburn, and therefore, the dose of BB-UVB is decreased further. After approximately 2 weeks, small increments in dosimetry are attempted and tolerated well. After 3 to 4 weeks, the patient is able to tolerate the usual dosing protocol per her skin type 删除25：<u></u>, and her skin greatly improves along with the pruritus. The patient is instructed to continue using topical steroids and non-steroids focally on the lesions while largely maintaining with BB-UVB phototherapy.\n\n【9】Discussion\n----------\n\n【10】Phototherapy is a second-line treatment option for atopic dermatitis recalcitrant to topical therapies 删除33：<u></u> 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Table 24.1 shows the recommended use of phototherapy for the treatment of atopic dermatitis per the American Academy of Dermatology. Phototherapy is advantageous in that there are no internal side effects as opposed to systemic treatments for atopic dermatitis such as prednisone, methotrexate, azathioprine, and mycophenolate mofetil.

The recommended protocols to treat patients with atopic dermatitis are similar to that of psoriasis patients as discussed in Chap. 1 for UVB phototherapy, Chap. 2 for PUVA, and Chap. 3 for excimer laser, although atopic dermatitis patients can be treated slightly more conservatively due to the hyper-irritability of their skin . Furthermore, as discussed in Chap. 4 , the Goeckerman regimen is also very effective for severe, recalcitrant, generalized atopic dermatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】删除3：<u>Figure 24.1\n\n【12】A patient with severe, generalized, recalcitrant atopic dermatitis who is a candidate for UVB phototherapy</u>\nTable 24.1 删除换行 Recommended use of phototherapy for the treatment of atopic dermatitis per the American Academy of Dermatology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>\n\n| Phototherapy is a second line treatment, after failure of first-line treatment (emollients, topical steroids, and topical calcineurin inhibitors). |\n| --- |\n| Phototherapy can be used as maintenance therapy in patients with chronic disease. |\n| Phototherapy treatment of all forms should be under the guidance and ongoing supervision of a physician knowledgeable in phototherapy techniques. |\n| The light modality chosen should be guided by factors such as availability, cost, patient skin type, skin cancer history, patient use of photosensitizing medications, etc. |\n| The dosing and scheduling of light should be based upon minimal erythema dose (MED) and/or Fitzpatrick skin type. |\n| Home phototherapy under the direction of a physician may be considered for patients who are unable to receive phototherapy in an office setting. |\nTable 24.2 删除换行 Treatment protocol for NB-UVB for atopic dermatitis at the UCSF Phototherapy Unit\n\n| Skin type | Dose (mJ/cm 2 ) | Subsequent increase (mJ/cm 2 ) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| I | 130 | 15–50 |\n| II | 220 | 15–50 |\n| III | 260 | 15–100 |\n| IV | 330 | 15–100 |\n| V | 350 | 15–150 |\n| VI | 400 | 15–150 |\nTable 24.3 删除换行 Treatment protocol for BB-UVB for atopic dermatitis at the UCSF phototherapy unit\n\n| Skin type | Initial dose (mJ/cm 2 ) | Subsequent increase (mJ/cm 2 ) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| I | 10 | 10–50 |\n| II | 20 | 10–50 |\n| III | 30 | 10–50 |\n| IIII | 40 | 10–50 |\n| V | 50 | 10–75 |\n| VI | 60 | 10–75 |\n\n【16】Although there is no single phototherapy modality that is clearly superior in terms of efficacy, it has been shown that natural sunlight is likely less effective than artificial light sources 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. In the authors’ experience, BB-UVB appears to work notably better for patients with atopic dermatitis as BB-UVB appears to be less irritating as compared to NB-UVB in this patient population. Patients with idiopathic, generalized pruritus, many of who are elderly, also appear to tolerate BB-UVB better. Therefore, at the UCSF Phototherapy Unit, BB-UVB is recommended first for patients with atopic dermatitis or chronic idiopathic pruritus.\nTable 24.4 删除换行 Missed treatment protocol for both NB-UVB and BB-UVB for atopic dermatitis\n\n| Missed visit | Action (for all skin types) |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1–7 days | Increase dose per protocol |\n| 8–11 days | Hold dose constant |\n| 12–20 days | Decrease by 25% |\n| 21–27 days | Decrease by 50% |\n| 28 or more days | Restart with initial dose |\n\n【18】As discussed on in Chap. 7 on “inititation burn”, it is not uncommon for patients with atopic dermatitis to experience irritation and even frank sunburn from a very low dose of UV light. This is because the skin of atopic dermatitis patients is chronically hyper-irritable with or without obvious eczematoid lesions, that they can even be irritated initially by light. However, in most cases, unless it is a case of severe photosensitive eczema, the skin is capable of “getting used to” the light with persistence and gentle modulation of dosimetry 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Since UVB phototherapy is one of the safest therapeutic options available to help maintain atopic dermatitis skin under good control long term, it is a shame to give up on this modality as soon as the patient complains of initial irritation. Therefore, it is important to be able to figure out how to make phototherapy work for atopic dermatitis patients who may have very sensitive skin.\n\n【19】In this patient with generalized atopic dermatitis uncontrolled on topical therapies, UVB phototherapy is a good option provided that it is started very carefully, monitoring for initiation burn or light-induced irritability. Due to involvement of her face, the face can be exposed during phototherapy, but proper precautions should be taken with eye protection 删除33：<u></u>. The patient should commit to 3 times per week treatment sessions for at least 12 weeks, followed by ongoing treatments at least once weekly for maintenance therapy long-term. Concomitant use of topical therapies, including topical corticosteroids, non-steroid topical therapies (tacrolimus, pimecrolimus), and topical tar, are encouraged (but not on the skin during actual phototherapy sessions) in addition to a gentle skin care regimen consisting of frequent moisturizing and avoidance of triggers.\n\n【20】删除3：<u>Figure 24.2\n\n【21】When the treating the face with phototherapy, proper eye protection should be worn by the patient</u>",

The cancer risk is increased among postmenopausal women， when discharge is associated with abnormal findings on breast imaging， or when a mass is associated with nipple discharge.\n The most common cause ofunilateral serosanguineous nipple discharge in the absence ofa breast mass is an intraductal papilloma.\nPathologic nipple discharge evaluation needs to include evaluation to rule out breast cancers.\n Antihypertensive medications， phenothiazines， antidepressants， and antipsychotic medications can all cause nipple discharges.

        "text": "【0】Case Files™ Neurology, Second Edition    \n\n【1】### CASE 46\n\n【2】A 13-year-old right-hand dominant girl has increasingly frequent headaches over the past year. She has “always” had headaches, but they became more bothersome approximately 3 years ago in association with onset of menses, and decreased sleep. Her typical headache begins with a sense of slowed thinking and malaise followed soon after by a throbbing pain over the left side of her head, the right side of her head or, at times, over her forehead. The pain increases to its maximum severity of 8 to 9 out of 10 over the course of approximately 1 hour and will last for “many hours” if untreated. The patient reports that even light touch over the affected part of her head causes pain, and she is sensitive to bright lights and loud sounds. She typically feels nauseous and will occasionally have emesis. Acetaminophen and ibuprofen seem to help, but the best pain relief comes with sleeping in a dark room. After the pain resolves, she feels cognitively slow and “out of sorts” for up to a full day. Over the past year, however, the incidence of such attacks has increased to once every 2 to 3 weeks leading to frequent missed days in school and a drop in school performance. They seem to be associated with menses or poor sleep. Her physical examination and neurologic examination are completely normal. She consistently has had motion sickness “for as long as she can remember.” Neurodevelopmentally she met all milestones. The patient’s mother had “bad headaches” as a teenager and young adult and she has a maternal aunt, who was diagnosed with migraines at approximately 20 years of age. No other neurologic diseases are noted in the family.\n\n【3】 What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【4】 What is the next diagnostic step?\n\n【5】 What is the next step in therapy?\n\n【6】### ANSWERS TO CASE 46: Pediatric Headache (Migraine Without Aura)\n\n【7】Summary : This 13-year-old right-handed healthy girl presents with a history of recurrent hemicranial headaches that are throbbing with moderate to moderately severe pain in a crescendo–decrescendo pattern associated with nausea and occasional emesis. She also reports photophobia and phonophobia. The headaches will last for many hours untreated, are improved somewhat with low doses of acetaminophen, and resolved if the patient can get to sleep. There is a brief prodrome of malaise and a more prolonged postdrome of cognitive dulling. The only noted triggers are sleep deprivation, and she has noted an association with her menstrual cycle. Her neurologic examination is completely normal, and her family history is significant for two people with probable migraines.\n\n【8】• Most likely diagnosis: Migraine without aura ( common migraine ).\n\n【9】• Next diagnostic step: No diagnostic workup necessary at this point.\n\n【10】• Next step in therapy: Trial of appropriately dosed nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) followed by a trial of triptans if necessary. Consider prophylactic therapy given headache frequency.\n\n【11】#### ANALYSIS\n\n【12】##### Objectives\n\n【13】1\\. Understand the difference between primary and secondary headaches.\n\n【14】2\\. Know the clinical criteria for pediatric migraine headaches.\n\n【15】3\\. Understand the role of neuroimaging in evaluating headaches.\n\n【16】4\\. Know the different options available for acute abortive therapy for pediatric migraines.\n\n【17】5\\. Recognize when daily prophylactic therapy is warranted in migraine treatment and what possible options exist.\n\n【18】##### Considerations\n\n【19】This otherwise healthy and neurodevelopmentally normal 13-year-old girl is brought in for evaluation of frequent headaches. Because she is currently headache-free with a normal neurologic examination, attention can be turned to classifying her headache disorder, which will aid in dictating any necessary workup and intervention. A primary headache is one in which the head pain itself is the principal clinical entity, and there is no other underlying causative disorder. Tension-type headaches and migraine headaches would be common examples of such conditions. Secondary headaches, conversely, are headaches caused by another underlying disorder such as intracranial hemorrhage, central nervous system infection, temporomandibular joint pain, or substance abuse. In general, secondary headaches are defined by the underlying principal problem and require a more extensive and prompt evaluation. Primary headaches, however, are generally defined by their clinical symptoms and can require no workup if clinical criteria are met. The history in this scenario is classic for migraine with the unilateral aspect, throbbing, aura, family history, and triggers.\n\n【20】### APPROACH TO: Pediatric Headache\n\n【21】Head pain in children and adults can be divided into primary and secondary headaches. It can also be useful to consider the pattern of the patient’s headaches: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> acute recurrent —episodic head pain with pain-free intervals in between; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> chronic progressive —gradually worsening head pain with no pain-free intervals; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> chronic daily headache—a persistent headache that neither worsens nor remits; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> a mixed headache —a chronic daily headache with episodic exacerbations. Chronic progressive headaches raise the possibility of increasing intracranial pressure and require further evaluation with neuroimaging. Chronic daily headaches can be a secondary headache caused by cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, or can arise from a primary headache disorder. This condition as well as mixed headaches can require referral to a headache specialist.\n\n【22】In 2004, the International Headache Society defined the criteria for pediatric migraine:\n\n【23】A. Headache attack lasting 1 to 72 hours\n\n【24】B. Headache has at least two of the following four features:\n\n【25】通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Either bilateral or unilateral (frontal/temporal) location\n\n【26】通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> Pulsating quality\n\n【27】通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> Moderate-to-severe intensity\n\n【28】通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> Aggravated by routine physical activities\n\n【29】C. At least one of the following accompanies headache:\n\n【30】通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Nausea and/or vomiting 删除换行1 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> Photophobia and phonophobia (can be inferred from their behavior)\n\n【31】D. Five or more attacks fulfilling the above criteria\n\n【32】The mean age of onset for pediatric migraine is approximately 7 years of age for boys and 11 years of age for girls. With regard to prevalence, 8% to 23% of children meet criteria for migraines in the second decade of life making such primary headaches a very common problem. Although migraines can be seen in children as young as 3 years of age, the prevalence is less than 3%. This is likely an underestimate, however, given the difficulty of making the diagnosis in very young children. Migraines commonly “run in families” and have a significant genetic component although only relatively rare migraine syndromes have been directly linked to a single gene mutation. Many cases of familial hemiplegic migraine, for example, have been linked to a mutation in the CACNA1A gene that encodes a voltage-gated P/Q-type calcium channel. One interesting association with migraine is that many patients report having motion sickness (ie, “car sickness”) as children. Although this clinical finding is useful if present, its absence in no way diminishes the possibility of migraine.\n\n【33】As in adults, migraines in children often begin with a prodromal premonitory phase with neurologic or constitutional symptoms lasting for hours or days before the headache. These “warning signs” can slowly increase over time or remain constant. Some patients develop an aura prior to the onset of pain that consists of a stereotyped focal symptom usually preceding the headache by no more than an hour. Visual auras are the most common type and can involve a variety of visual aberrations such as scotomata, flashes, or geometric forms. Motor, sensory, and cognitive auras can also be seen. The pattern of the pain is typically crescendo in onset and decrescendo in offset and is certainly not maximal from the beginning. As the pain continues, the patient often develops cutaneous allodynia, which means that normally non-noxious stimulation is perceived as painful during the headache. Associated elements such as nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, vertigo, and nasal congestion are common. Following the headache, most patients experience a post-dromal phase with symptoms such as difficulty concentrating, particular food cravings, and fatigue. Triggers commonly associated with migraine headaches include strong smells, particularly if noxious, exercise, sleep deprivation, missing meals, and mild head trauma. Many patients associate certain foods with the onset of their migraines, but this can at times be difficult to distinguish between food cravings occurring during the prodromal phase. Women with migraines are more likely to experience headaches around the time of menses.\n\n【34】#### EVALUATION\n\n【35】A careful history and physical examination are the most important aspects of the evaluation. When the history is unequivocally consistent with migraine and the neurologic examination is completely normal, no further workup is needed. In particular, neuroimaging is unnecessary, and the yield is low. However, an abnormal neurologic examination, or worrisome feature on history necessitates an MRI scan. Although most parents fear the presence of a brain tumor, more than 98% of patients with intracranial masses have abnormalities on their neurologic examination. It is important that the neurologic examination include an assessment of head circumference, visualization of the optic discs, assessment of nuchal rigidity, and palpation of the sinuses in order to carefully screen for underlying causes. Electroencephalography (EEG) is not routinely indicated in the evaluation of headaches. Patients with epilepsy often have postictal headaches, but it would be quite unusual for the headache to be the primary presenting complaint. Lumbar puncture (LP) is essential if head pain is thought to be caused by a CNS infection and is part of the evaluation of subarachnoid hemorrhage (if a CT scan is unrevealing). LP however has no routine role in the evaluation of primary headache disorders.\n\n【36】#### TREATMENT AND MANAGEMENT\n\n【37】Treatment of migraine focuses on two concepts: acute pain relief (abortive therapy) and headache prevention (prophylactic therapy) . There are an ever-increasing number of available medications that can be used for abortive therapy with few controlled trials to help guide decision making. Perhaps the best studied medications are ibuprofen and acetaminophen and both have been shown to be safe and effective in children. Many patients will already have tried such medications prior to coming to see their doctor, but they often have been underdosed or given late in the progression of the headache, which renders them as much less effective. In such patients, it is worth a trial of adequately dosed ibuprofen (10 mg/kg) or acetaminophen (15 mg/kg) given as soon as possible after the onset of the pain. If these medications prove ineffective, then a trial of 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor agonists (the triptans ) is indicated. These agents are available in a variety of formulations and also differ from one another in terms of half-life. At present, the best pediatric data supports the use of sumatriptan nasal spray as an abortive agent in children . Oral formulations and subcutaneous injections have not been subjected to adequate trials in children at this point.\n\n【38】For patients with frequent migraines (eg, two or more a month) or particularly long-lasting or disabling migraines, daily prophylactic medications can be considered with the treatment goal being to decrease headache frequency. Compliance with a daily medication is a requirement. Sometimes, avoidance of triggers can significantly diminish headache frequency obviating the need for prophylactic medications. Simple lifestyle modification, such as keeping to a regular schedule of eating and sleeping and avoiding triggers, can significantly decrease the headache burden. Should medication be necessary, several classes of pharmacologic agents are used as prophylactic treatments: beta-blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, antihista-mines, calcium channel blockers, and anticonvulsants. As is the case with abortive therapies, much better data exists for the use of prophylactic medications in adults. Cyproheptadine has long been used in younger children for this purpose, but supportive data is based on retrospective nonblinded trials. Similarly, amitriptyline is somewhat sedating although generally well tolerated, but its efficacy has only been shown in retrospective studies. The use of anticonvulsants, particularly topiramate, for migraine prophylaxis is increasing in both adult and pediatric patients. Although good quality studies have supported its use in adults, there have yet to be adequate clinical trials in children.\n\n【39】####",

This is the localized  删除换行1 presentation of the staphylococcal scalded-skin syndrome and patients are otherwise well.\nAt the other end of the spectrum are those who present with generalized cutaneous involvement and systemic illness. Both are caused by Staphylococcus aureus, most of which are from  删除换行1 phage group 2. In bullous impetigo, the organism can be cultured from the lesions but the  删除换行1 systemic form is mediated by exfoliative toxins and swabs are sterile.\n\n【23】In contrast, the weepy, golden, crusty forms of impetigo are also usually caused by S. aureus, 删除换行1 but generally not from phage group 2. Group A β-haemolytic Streptococcus can also cause  删除换行1 impetigo. This common form of impetigo starts on skin that has been damaged, e.g. by insect  删除换行1 bites, chickenpox or abrasions. It spreads easily to other sites and to other children. Patients  删除换行1 with eczema are at increased risk of infective exacerbations due to these organisms. It is  删除换行1 likely that Amy’s infection was transmitted from her mother, either because of her eczema or  删除换行1 because she has mastitis.\n\n【24】A much rarer cause of blistering in the neonatal period is epidermolysis bullosa. There are  删除换行1 several different types that differ in severity, clinical features, distribution and inheritance  删除换行1 patterns, but all are characterized by blisters that develop with even relatively mild trauma  删除换行1 and are exacerbated in warm weather. Blisters present at birth would be strongly supportive  删除换行1 of this diagnosis.\n\n【25】Treatment of bullous impetigo is with a β-lactamase-resistant antibiotic such as co-amoxiclav.\nIn this case, Amy is systemically well and so the oral route can be safely used whilst monitoring for a satisfactory response. In systemic-scalded skin syndrome, antibiotics are administered parenterally. Such patients need careful monitoring because they are at risk of significant  删除换行1 heat and fluid losses. They also require adequate pain relief.\n\n【26】The umbilical lesion is likely to be a granuloma. The umbilical cord usually dries and separates within 6–8 days after birth and the surface epithelializes. When this is incomplete or  删除换行1 there is mild infection, granulation tissue can develop and persist. A granuloma is soft, friable but not painful. A number of treatments are available, most commonly cauterization  删除换行1 using a silver nitrate stick. This can be repeated once a week until the lesion has resolved.\nIt is crucial to differentiate the common umbilical granuloma from the rare umbilical polyp  删除换行1 which results from persistence of the omphalomesenteric duct or the urachus. If this communicates with the ileum or bladder, there may a faeculent or urinary discharge. The treatment  删除换行1 is surgical.\n\n【27】Key Points\n\n【28】• Skin infections due to Staphylococcus aureus have a range of presentations from  删除换行1 mild, localized lesions to severe, systemic infections.\n\n【29】• Blistering present at birth is likely to be due to epidermolysis bullosa.",

Which of the imnmunological defects in this disease would you think is involved?\n\n【4】4 Why does bone marrow transplantation not affect the oculocutaneous albinism and neurological disease?\n\n【5】5 Do you know ofanother immurodeficiengy caused by mutations in aBEACH protein family member?\n\n【6】删除6：<u>This page intentionally left blank to match pagination of print book</u>\n\n【7】Answers: Answer 1\n\n【8】The nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) test measures the capacity of the lysosomes in a phagocyte to produce superoxide and other oxygen free radicals. The test is done by adding yellow NBT dye to phagocytes that are then stimulated with a cell activator， typically phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). Activation of the NADPH oxidase enzyme complex in the lysosome by PMA leads to the production of the reactive intermedi-ates of oxygen that modify NBT into formazan， which has a deep blue color. Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) affects the normal formation and traffic of vesicles in the cell， but does not affect function of the NADPH oxidase. Thus， Shweta's neutrophils could readily reduce NBT to a blue color.\n\n【9】Answer 2\n\n【10】An easy and non-invasive test with which to confirm CHS is microscopic observa-tion of a hair shaft. The hair of patients with CHS has abnormal pigmentation： when observed under the microscope， the hair shaft is seen as speckled with clumps of pig-ment instead of the normal homogeneous distribution 删除33：<u></u>. When the hair bulb of CHS patients is examined under electron microscopy， melanocytes showing enlarged melanosomes with variable amounts of melanin pigment are seen\n\n【11】Answer 3\n\n【12】The accelerated phase of CHS is thought to be due to impaired lymphocyte cyto-toxicity， although the precise pathogenic mechanism is so far unclear. A similar process is observed in other diseases with impaired cytotoxicity such as familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHL) 删除25：<u></u>. Many cases of FHL are due to mutations in perforin l， a gene that encodes a lytic enzyme that is contained in the granules of cytotoxic lymphocytes and is essential for cytotoxicity. Evidence suggests that the accelerated phase of CHS may typically occur after infection with Epstein-Barr virus. In this setting， the immune system is unsuccessful in killing the virus-infected cells； in attempting to control the infection， lymphocytes proliferate without restraint.\n\n【13】Answer 4\n\n【14】Bone marrow transplantation is only able to correct defects that are due to cells of hematopoietic origin. Oculocutaneous albinism and the neurological defects seen in patients with CHS are not due to dysfunction of hematopoietic cells， so these abnormalities cannot be corrected by a bone marrow transplant. At one time， it was believed that the neurological disease was due to persistent lymphocyte infiltration of the CNS， but later studies have shown intrinsic defects in the neurons and glia of patients with CHS， which have disproved that hypothesis. The oculocutaneous albi-nism is due to a defect in the melanocytes that produce pigment in the skin， eyes， andhair\n\n【15】LPS-responsive beige-like anchor (LRBA) deficiency 删除25：<u></u>.",

        "text": "【0】Case 2.1 Hypersensitivity masquerading as sepsis\n\n【1】A 57-year-old Caucasian male was seen in the emergency department (ED) late on 6/9/15 with fever， chills， fatigue， and body aches. His symptoms had started on that day， less than 12 hours before. His temperature at home was as high as 104°F. He was brought to the ED by his wife for further evaluation. An air-line pilot， he had flown in from the West Coast of the United States back home to the Gulf Coast of Mississippi that same day. Because of his history of interna-tional travel， the initial suspicion was for some exotic viral infection. The physical examination was in general unremarkable. He had no jaundice and no rash.\n\n【2】His initial labs showed a WBC of 2.8， H/H 14.3 and 43.7， respectively. MCV was normal at 87.5， but platelet count was low at 86，000. The comprehensive metabolic profile， including liver tests and renal function tests， was unremark-able.\n\n【3】The past history was significant for the following： known aortic stenosis with systolic murmur， allergic rhinitis， and various surgical procedures that included colonoscopy x3， left Achilles tendon repair， left upper jaw dental implant， ton-sillectomy and appendectomy in childhood， as well as right orchiectomy for seminoma in 1978， treated and cured following radiation therapy. He had allergy to penicillin： rash， noted in childhood years.\n\n【4】The family and epidemiologic history were significant for the following： a pilot with an international airline， he was married and had two grown daughters in their late 20s. He did not smoke or drink. No member of the family was ill. For the last 2-3 years he had been flying from a US city to Lagos， Nigeria， typically weekly， 3-4 times a month. These weekly flights are non-stop and he would stay overnight in Nigeria， at an international hotel with air conditioning， and would leave the next day on the trip back to the US. He left on 5/27/15 from Lagos on his last trip back home， 12 days before the ED visit.\n\n【5】· What differential diagnoses would you contemplate in this patient?\n\n【6】He was required to take malaria prophylaxis， and had been prescribed daily atovaquone-proguanil. However， he admitted taking the last dose of this drug I year earlier， in June 2014.\n\n【7】Following initial evaluation， blood cultures ×2 were done， along with other labs， including malaria smears， thick and thin smears by Giemsa stain.\n\n【8】A presumptive diagnosis of malaria was made and the patient was prescribed an antimalarial agent. Fortunately， he already had some atovaquone-proguanil at home， left over from his previous prescription for prophylaxis. Although he was clinically stable， it was important to start antimalarial therapy as soon as possible. Typically， antimalarial drugs are not usually available on demand at the local pharmacies. However， he was able to start his antimalarial therapy within a few hours of leaving the ED. He was prescribed 3 days of four tablets of atovaquone-proguanil daily， which he completed. He started feeling much better within 24-48 hours of starting the medication.\n\n【9】I spoke with the ED physician and the patient's primary care physician later， and with the patient， to confirm that he was doing well. I reviewed the Giemsa malaria smears (thin smears) shown in Figs 5.3a and 5.3b. The smears show the ring forms (early trophozoites) in normal-sized RB’s， as well as two ring form trophozoites in a single RBC.\n\n【10】We requested follow-up malaria smears， to document clearance of the para-sitemia.\n\n【11】One week later， the patient was off on vacation with his family， already back to his baseline healthy status.\n\n【12】删除3：<u>Figure 5.3a A. Peripheral blood malaria stain (Giemsa， thin smear) done on 6/9/15 showing intracellular ring forms in normal-sized red cells. B. Segmented PMN noted for size comparison. </u>\n\n【13】删除3：<u>Figure 5.3b Peripheral blood malaria stain (Giemsa， thin smear)， 6/9/15， showing intracellular ring forms in normal-sized red cells. One RBC had two ring forms， suggesting P. falciparum.</u>\n\n【14】Follow-up visit and post-treatment course\n\n【15】The peripheral smears were reviewed later， confirming the result as compatible with malaria， likely falciparum malaria， especially with two ring forms in a single normal-sized RBC.\n\n【16】The follow-up Giemsa smear done 6 days later on 6/15/15 (before his vaca-tion trip) showed no malaria parasites. The platelet count had recovered back to normal at 202，000. The WBC was 4.4 (up from 2.8). The comprehensive metabolic profile was still normal， including the liver and renal function tests.\n\n【17】He was seen 3 weeks later in the office on 7/2/15 for a scheduled follow-up visit. He was completely asymptomatic. He admitted that he had not taken the prescribed prophylaxis for malaria. There had been no unusual exposures that he was aware of， including to mosquitoes， but he did spend some brief time in Nigeria outside his air-conditioned hotel room.\n\n【18】His physical exam was generally unremarkable， except for a systolic ejection murmur， grade 3/6， consistent with the known aortic stenosis. He was well-built and fit. He had no jaundice and no rash. His neurologic exam was normal.\n\n【19】Results of the Plasmodium species PCR test (done at a reference laboratory) were received just before the scheduled office visit. The test confirmed that P fal-ciparum was positive， while the test was negative for the other species： P. knowlesi， P. malariae， P. ovale， and P. vivax. This was compatible with the clinical impression and the Giemsa thin smear findings previously described.\n\n【20】We did not order a G6PD test on the patient and he did not receive any additional therapy， such as primaquine， because for P. falciparum， the atovaquone-proguanil therapy was adequate， with no need for a \"radical cure\"of the liver phase infection.\n\n【21】·Final diagnosis： Uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria.\n\n【22】The patient had appropriate antimalarial therapy， and responded as expected. He did not require admission to the hospital.\nComparison of the characteristics of five patients with malaria seen between 1998 and 2015 删除换行5 Table 5.3a is a comparison of the characteristics of five patients with malaria seen between 1998 and 2015.\n\n【23】Case discussion\n\n【24】All five patients presented here had high fever (maximum temperature above103°F) with chills， in association with head and body aches. They were all rela-tively young people who had undertaken recent travel， except for case #2， who had left the region of infection acquisition 8-9 months earlier. He did not com-plete his malaria prophylaxis appropriately. In fact， two of these five patients did not take any antimalarial medication at all (patients #1 and #4)， while patients #2and #3 took the prescribed prophylactic antimalarial medication inappropriately or incompletely. Case #5 was an airline pilot who did frequent trips to Nigeria， in West Africa. He had not taken any antimalarial prophylaxis since June 2014， for I year before the onset of his febrile illness with malaria.\n\n【25】Plasmodium falciparum was found in the two patients who acquired their infec-tion from Central America or the Caribbean， while two of those acquiring their infection from West-Central Africa likely had non-falciparum malaria. All of these patients recovered without sequelae， and responded appropriately to antimalar-ial medication. Thrombocytopenia resolved rapidly in all five patients within a few days to 1 week of starting appropriate antimalarial medication.\n\n【26】All five cases of malaria were considered imported into the United States， while two of three cases acquired from Africa were both imported and possibly relapsing or recrudescent. Case #5 was uncomplicated acute acquired P. falci-parum malaria， imported from West Africa. This patient had not taken the pre-scribed atovaquone-proguanil in I year.\n\n【27】The patient seen in 2006 (case #4) acquired her malaria while vacationing in the Dominican Republic， and became ill after return to the USA. Her illness was complicated by iatrogenic septic thrombophlebitis (methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus positive blood culture 4 days after admission) related to contaminated\n\n【28】Table 5.3a Comparison of five cases of malaria seen between 1998 and 2015\n\n| Characteristic  | Case 1 (Case 5.1)  | Case 2 (Case 5.2)  | Case 3  | Case 4  | Case 5 (Case 5.3)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Dates ot  | 10/28-11/2/98  | 5/15-5/17/99  | 5/3-5/8/01  | 4/23-4/29/06  | 6/9/15  |\n| hospitalization  | (5 days)  | (2 days)  | (5 days)  | (6 days)  | (0 day)： seen in  |\n| (days)  |  |  |  |  | ED only  |\n| Age (years)/sex  | 15/male  | 23/male  | 43/male  | 39/female  | 57/male  |\n| Major symptoms  | Fever， chills， rigors， dry  | Nausea， vomiting，  | Splitting headache，  | Fever， chills， head and  | Fever， chills，  |\n|  | cough， headache  | fever， chills， sweats，  | fever， chills， rigors，  | body aches； some  | fatigue， body aches  |\n|  |  | head and body ache  | body aches， dry cough  | nausea， fatigue， and  |  |\n|  |  |  |  | malaise  |  |\n| Duration of symptoms  | 6 days  | 6 days  | 2-3 weeks?  | 2-3 days  | One day  |\n| before admission  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Max. temperature  | 104.4  | 103.5  | 104.5  | 103.2  | 103.7  |\n| recorded (F)  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Lowest platelet count  | 31，000  | 32，000  | 96，000  | 22，000  | 86，000  |\n| notec  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Region where  | Central America  | West-Central Africa  | West-Central Africa  | Caribbean (Dominican  | Nigeria， West Africa  | 删除换行3 | infection was acquirec  |  |  |  | Republic)  |  |\n| Time from  | 13-19 days  | Probably 8-9 months  | 2-4 weeks  | 18 days (2-3 weeks)  | 2-4 weeks  |\n| presumptive exposure  | (2-3 weeks)  |  |  |  |  |\n| to illness onset  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| (estimate)  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n【30】Table 5.3a (Continued)\n\n| Characteristic  | Case 1 (Case 5.1)  | Case 2 (Case 5.2)  | Case 3  | Case 4  | Case 5 (Case 5.3)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Plasmodium sp.  | P falciparum  | Non-falciparum  | Likely non-falciparum  | P. falciparum  | P falciparum  |\n| incriminated  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Chemoprophylaxis  | None  | Inconsistent or  | Inconsistent or  | None  | None  |\n| taken  |  | incomplete  | sporadic  |  |  |\n| Mode of acquisition  | Imported  | Imported or relapsing  | Imported/relapsing/or  | Imported  | Imported  |\n|  |  |  | recrudescent  |  |  |\n| Outcome/treatment  | Survived/chloroquine  | Survived/quinine and  | Survived/quinine and  | Survived/chloroquine  | Survived/  |\n|  |  | doxycycline  | doxycycline  |  | atovaquone-proguanil  |\n| Other comments  | Patient responded  | Because the  | A merchant marine：  | Her illness was  | Malaria was  |\n|  | rapidly to Rx.  | Plasmodium species  | made several trips to  | complicated with  | uncomplicated.

She is in a stable relationship, and she and her partner  删除换行1 have had regular sexual intercourse hoping that she would conceive after coming off the pill.\nShe did a pregnancy test 2 days previously and it was negative. Before she started on the contraceptive pill, she used to have irregular periods with cycles between 28 days and 3 months.\nShe does complain of mild acne and some facial hair. She has no significant past medical  删除换行1 history in particular no past history of abdominal operations or pelvic inflammatory disease.\nShe has never been pregnant. Her partner has no children.

This excess visceral adipose fat causes various abnormalities， such as type 2 diabetes， arterial hypertension， or dys-lipidaemia. Epidemiological studies have shown an increase in the relative risk of cardiovascular mortality， myocardial infarction， and general mortality in patients with an enlarged waistline.\n\n【6】It is also important to know that even a slight reduction in weight brings a significant reduction in the risks associated with abdominal obesity. Dietary recommendations are important in this respect， and it is preferable to manage with a modest calorific reduction in conjunction with what I often recommend， which is a change in eating behaviour， rather than a diet that the patient would be content with following for a shorter or longer period.\n\n【7】I often tell my students and patients that weight loss can only be established over longer periods than those envisaged by my medical colleagues； I am thinking of three- to five-year periods necessary for losing five to ten kilos in order to consolidate， over ten years in total， an ideal weight adapted to the patient's new eating behaviours. The 删除换行1 time that I indicate observes much more closely the body's adaptation to new ways of eating. Excessively fast weight loss constitutes an attack for the body， and the central nervous system， as the main agent that controls eating behaviours， not understanding what is suddenly hap-pening， does everything it can to store what are assumed to be the nec-essary calories to ensure the survival of the body that it is controlling. The central nervous system precisely calculates weight based on cur-rent data； it is these data that have to be changed. According to my clinical experience， the central nervous system has very long periodsof adaptation， and the of2weight loss has to be achieved in a similar way to going down a staircase stopping at each step. Observing such a pro-cedure allows the brain to encode the weight reduction gradually and to maintain the weight that the patient wishes to reach. It is important to understand that this requires an alliance between the patient’s ego and the central “management\"organ of the body-the central nerv-ous system (or CNS)； knowing your body well is the best strategy. The benefits of physical exercise have been abundantly demonstrated， and must accompany the changes in eating behaviour.\n\n【8】Marie-Laure's psychosomatic risk\n\n【9】Marie-Laure has returned to some physical activity； she is being treated by a physiotherapist and the doctors emphasise that this is a patient with a good observance of medical advice.\n\n【10】How does a psychosomatician analyse the data presented above? We first have to ascertain the latency periods between life events and the emergence of somatic symptoms； the arterial hypertension that has become resistant over time emerged soon after her first daughter was born and， according to my hypothesis， was considerably reinforced by the conflict with her husband， which ended in a divorce three years after the symptom appeared， combined with continuous work-related stress over a twenty-year period. No doctor can overlook the conse-quences of life events on the general equilibrium； to these two events， we must add the patient's incapacity to mourn even her conflictual rela-tionships. I must note here the existence of a masochistic component that enabled her to tolerate difficult situations for lengthy periods.\nHaving reached the age of fifty， two years before I examined her， our patient became menopausal， which constitutes a challenge to be over-come； she has to adapt psychically to a new， altered state of her body.\n\n【11】This period is very often accompanied by depression， and my medical colleagues emphasise the patient's depressed state， for which her psychiatrist had prescribed an antidepressant. The menopause is often accompanied by changes in the body image that represent an ordeal for women. As will be seen later， in another case presentation relating to organ transplants， we are dealing with two changes： a change in the neuronal body image and a change in the psychic body image.\n\n【12】The patient also has difficulties adapting to changes in her life situ-ations， especially in her body； she is deeply regressed and psychically fixed in an \"oral\" position， since oral satisfactions (food， cigarettes， etc.) are the favoured formulas of her equilibrium. The results are visible， since she has put on forty kilos in twenty years and her current body-mass index (BMI) is 31.5， that is to say obese (from 30 to 35). The patient's resources are limited， since physical activities are only recent and still very infrequent； there are no leisure activities， friendly relationships are restricted to rare annual meetings， and there is no love relationship. We note that the “zone\" of satisfaction in life is very limited. This state can only cause us concern for the future， especially given that if the psychia-trist does not manage to instigate the mourning process， the patient will be in danger when she takes her retirement， and， of course， when her second daughter leaves home. The future looks bleak if we follow a sce-nario of the patient's progressive disorganisation caused by her retire-ment and the incapacity to redeploy her energy in projects that might support the life drives. My report on the consultation could therefore contain some pessimistic comments.\n\n【13】But we can also envisage a second scenario by considering the fol-lowing positive elements： presence of a narcissistic core (self-love) that allows the patient to continue to take care of herself， as shown by her physical appearance at the time of the consultation； the presence of a masochistic core that enables her to tolerate painful ordeals； and finally the presence of a capacity to observe medical guidance. This is a crucial factor in medicine and psychosomatics， because the doctors know (and there are statistics to prove it) that the proportion of patients follow-ing medical recommendations is increasingly low， hence the questions often raised about the efficacy of medicine. A patient who follows the prescriptions is therefore favourably viewed by the medical staff， who form the hypothesis that the somatic risk is consequently lower.\n\n【14】Another factor in the patient’s favour is the relationship of trust that she maintains with “good mother figures\"； this relationship with 删除换行1 external objects， such as the nurses， doctors， psychosomaticians， and so on enables her to lead her life. The nurses have noted this behaviour， as they have written in their logbook： “good observance， the stay in hospital has restored her spirits a little\". I often tell my students that， for some patients， the hospital is a good mother， and that is borne out in Marie-Laure's case. The nurses’ logbook should never be overlooked when considering patients.\n\n【15】The importance of a favourable environment that is conducive to improving health can therefore be noted； my therapeutic recommenda-tions will be made according to the hypothesis of a favourable environ-ment. If， in her psychotherapy， Marie-Laure manages to strengthen her capacities to invest her vital energy in new activities， such as friends， leisure pastimes， and physical activities， we can then take a more opti-mistic view of her future at a seven-year horizon. We cannot predict the accidents of life， but if the therapy does not achieve its objective—if Marie-Laure cannot confront the separation from her daughter and her work when she retires-we will be confronted with a severe problem of probable somatic disorganisations： cardiovascular risk and arterial hypertension.\n\n【16】Where the medical and psychosomatic predictions converge and diverge\n\n【17】The current medical approach is essentially based on analysing the biological factors and the patient’s medical history； the integrative psychosomatic examination， as I have developed it， considers the state of psychic functioning and its relation to somatic and psychic incidents in the patient’s history. To this， I add the effect of the mal-functioning of the mental apparatus on the neurological and entire biological system. This approach concerns all somatic pathologies， and in this respect I agree with my friend and colleague Christophe Dejours's observation that there are no psychosomatic illnesses or psychosomatic patients.\n\n【18】I am putting forward the hypothesis that the psychic apparatus participates to a greater or lesser degree in all somatic pathologies. If we take the medical approach， we note that Marie-Laure is in serious danger of cardiovascular risk in the long-term； if we add the psychoso-matic analysis we can understand that the cardiovascular risk can be greatly reduced by reintroducing Marie-Laure's capacity to change her 删除换行1 behaviour. Adding in the psychosomatic analysis means that we are reintroducing the dimension of the subject to medical practice.\n\n【19】The stability of psychic functioning is initially assessed on the basis of a person's relationship with his first love object—the mother， or mater-nal substitute. All research in psychoanalysis and the neurosciences emphasises the importance， in the first case， of psychic programming， and in the second， of neuronal programming in the earliest years of life. For human beings， and mammals in general， these two forms of programming occur through the relationship to the mother， who her-self exists in a relationship to the father， who is himself integrated into a wider environment. Psychoanalysts refer to the \"introjection of the object\"， confirming that the first stage of human psychosexual devel-opment has been completed (for Klein， at around nine months， in the ninth-month depression that signals this internalisation).\n\n【20】The unconscious perception of my relationship with Marie-Laure evolved throughout the interview； sitting opposite me was a woman of about fifty years， who seemed to want to talk. Then， her constant quest for approval led me to wonder about the new image that she was communicating to me； the pathological mournings gradually returned to what Klein terms the ninth-month depression， indicat-ing that the child has introjected the maternal object， making him capable of coping with the mother’s absence. The object seemed to me to be unstable； I perceived a fragile being in distress， and I still sensed in her the emotion connected with this demand for presence. The breakdown of the relationship with her mother led me to con-sider the hypothesis that， although she had separated from her mother， she had developed a strategy for moving as close as possible to her“good object\" choices and protecting herself against the \"bad object\"by separations (e.g.， from her mother) or from her managers at work by means of somatic problems. She was therefore in the position of splitting the good and the bad object： her mother was the bad object that she kept at a distance in time， and the doctors， medical staff， her husband， daughters， and so on were good objects with whom she could maintain relations because they allowed her to reduce the men-tal excitations connected with the stress of her life. I suppose that her superiors belonged to the bad objects. At the end of the interview， the image I had deep inside of me was of a fragile little girl who had been left on her own. One really wanted to help her， and the nurses were right about this in their comments.\n\n【21】14 A NEW BODY-MINDAPPROACH\n\n【22】On the theoretical level of integrative psychosomatics it can be noted that the psychic apparatus has not been able to provide an equilibrium to the patient at a very early stage， and that， through her oral libidinal fixations， the hypothalamic component3 of the central nervous system has provided the general equilibrium in conjunction with the psyche. We are confronted with interrelations between two systems that can provide a state of equilibrium in the psychosomatic unity； this is what I called the dual-control model， before establishing the model of the five systems.\n\n【23】The psychosomatic clinical examination form\n\n【24】Once the clinical examination has been conducted， it is advisable to complete the form (below) that I have developed from a new grid of the characteristics of somatic patients' functioning and a new nosography； this document considerably facilitates the communication between doctors and psychosomaticians， and enables us to assess the patient’s psychosomatic risk.\n\n【25】Concerning the creation and scientific development of this method-ological tool， entitled： “Method for assessing and diagnosing psycho-somatic health； the general assessment of psychosomatic risk\"， I have written the following brief introduction.\n\n【26】This psychosomatic diagnostic tool was developed from my research into professional stress undertaken from 1980； this has been the subject of many publications in France and worldwide， in par-ticular with Prof Cary Cooper of Manchester University and with a group of researchers from twenty-four countries. In 1984， I joined Pierre Marty at the Institute of Psychosomatics， which he founded in1978， and I undertook some research with him from 1987 on the psy-chosomatic classification that he had developed. I published some of our research findings jointly with him， and after his death I continued to apply this classification， leading to two publications in psychiatric journals 删除10：<u>(Stora， 1994，1995)</u>.\n\n【27】Applying this classification led me to conclude that the Marty clas-sification was incomplete and could not be used in its current form by doctors and psychologists if it was to be turned into a tool of psycho-somatic diagnosis and a method of epidemiological research. Pierre Marty possessed considerable clinical experience that he had not yet integrated into his classification.\n\n【28】I used many North American classifications for my research， and finally I formulated the present-day method， of which I have used a first outline to assess the greater or lesser risk of rejection in heart transplant patients. My publication now forms a chapter of the book on cardiology published by the heart transplant department at La Pitie-Salpetriere 删除10：<u>(Gandjbakhch et al.， 2000)</u>.\n\n【29】This method makes it possible to form a diagnosis and a strategy for psychotherapeutic treatment， as well as epidemiological studies in integrative psychosomatics. It is over a year ago that I undertook an investigation into breast cancer with Dr Pascale Surugue and col-leagues from the Institut Curie， with a view to validating the method that I have developed.\n\n【30】I know that psychoanalysts are opposed to such investigations， but， in Pierre Marty's lifetime and subsequently， our publications have proved that it is possible. Epidemiological research does not have ther-apeutic objectives， but sets out to compare structures of psychic and psychosomatic functioning in a way that allows patients’ points of vulnerability to be ascertained in order to assess their psychosomatic functioning and consequently their risk factors in psychic and somatic dimensions. I introduced the concept of risk to meet the concerns of the doctors with whom I work at La Pitie-Salpetriere.\n\n【31】Every observed patient (anamnesis) must first be resituated in the three dimensions to which the human being belongs， according to the bio-psycho-social model developed in Boston by Professor Engel.\n\n【32】I also refer to：\n\n【33】1\\. The model of the psychic apparatus in Freud’s metapsychology，and his first and second topography， articulated according to Marty's theoretical proposition from the integration of the second phase of the anal stage. I also adopt Freud’s theory of the drives， emphasis-ing the process of fusion and de-fusion (I particularly emphasise the second theory of the drives， life drives， death drives).\n\n【34】2\\. For a more detailed study of the stages of pregenital development， the models of Klein， Meltzer， Winnicott， Bion， Joyce McDougall， E. Kestenberg.\n\n【35】3\\. For narcissism， mainly Kohut's contributions (the grandiose self and Ego Ideal)， as well as Grunberger and Green.\n\n【36】4\\. For masochism， Freud'scontributionsand， more recently， Rosenberg's important work.\n\n【37】16 A NEW BODY-MINDAPPROACH\n\n【38】As an example， here is the form for Marie-Laure.\n\n【39】RESULTS OF THE PSYCHOSOMATIC CLINICAL EXAMINATION JBS-PSYSOMA-21 October 2010 version THE PSYCHOSOMATIC GRID Developed by J.

        "text": "【0】Question: 13.1 A 16-year-old girl presents to your office without her parents. She reports that she had recently had unprotected sex with her boyfriend. She is concerned she may have gonorrhea. She does not want her parents to know that she is requesting sexually transmitted infection screening because “they will kick me out of the house if they knew.” What is your obligation to her in most states in regard to patient confidentiality?\n\n【1】A. You are unable to perform any testing without permission from her parents because she is a minor.\n\n【2】B. You perform the sexually transmitted infection testing due to the duty to warn (as she may be spreading gonorrhea to other partners).\n\n【3】C. You perform the sexually transmitted infection testing due to exceptions of the duty to inform legal guardians in the care of a minor.\n\n【4】Answer: 13.1 C. Most states allow for adolescents to be screened for sexually transmitted infections without the consent of their legal guardians. This exception is to encourage adolescents to be screened for sexually transmitted infections.\n\n【5】Question: 13.2 You are a psychiatrist and one of your patients was recently fired from his job. At your last visit, you were concerned about his mental stability. During previous visits, you have established that your patient is an avid hunter and has easy access to a gun. In the mail today, you find a letter where he describes a detailed plan to kill his former boss along with himself. You believe the threat is credible and the former boss is at risk. What is your obligation in regard to patient confidentiality?\n\n【6】A. You contact the authorities immediately as you believe the threat is credible, and the duty to warn supersedes patient confidentiality in this situation.\n\n【7】B. You are upset but unable to contact the authorities because there is no situation that warrants breaking patient confidentiality.\n\n【8】C. You call the patient to have him come in to discuss his current mental status.\n\n【9】Answer: 13.2 A. The duty to warn has been established in cases where there is a possibility of serious harm to a nonpatient. As long as you feel the threat to a nonpatient is credible, it is your duty to contact the authorities or the possible victim.\n\n【10】Question: 13.3 A 38-year-old man presents to your clinic. He is a long-distance truck driver. He admits that he abuses alcohol and typically drinks at least 6 beers a day. He reports that he experiences withdrawal symptoms if he does not drink. You are concerned about his safety because he is frequently driving his truck while under the influence. What is you obligation in regard to patient confidentiality?\n\n【11】A. You develop a plan to treat him for alcoholism and advise him that it is against the law to drive a motor vehicle under the influence.\n\n【12】B. You develop a plan to treat him for alcoholism and advise him that it is against the law to drive a motor vehicle under the influence. You also contact the authorities to report that he is not able to safely operate a motorized vehicle in his current medical condition.\n\n【13】C. You develop a plan to treat him for alcoholism and advise him that it is against the law to drive a motor vehicle under the influence. You also contact his wife to let her know that he is not able to safely operate a motorized vehicle in his current medical condition.\n\n【14】Answer: 13.3 B. Most states have laws requiring or allowing the report of patients who are unable to safely operate a motorized vehicle. Until this patient’s alcoholic dependence is adequately treated, he is not able to safely operate a motorized vehicle and the proper authorities should be notified.\n\n【15】Question: 13.4 A 26-year-old woman presents to your office with complaints of hand pain that she attributes to an injury that occurred at her work while operating a machine. Radiographs are obtained, and a care plan is developed. A representative from her place of employment contacts your office a few days after the visit. Your patient has filed a workers’ compensation claim due to the hand injury. The representative would like copies of your office visit and radiologic findings. What is your obligation to your patient in regard to patient confidentiality?\n\n【16】A. You inform the representative from her place of employment that you are unable to give any copies of her medical record because doing so violates her confidentiality.\n\n【17】B. You inform the representative that you are going to fax her entire medical record today.\n\n【18】C. You inform the representative that you are going to fax only the portions of the medical record relevant to the hand injury.\nAnswer: 13.4 C. Under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, medical records can be disclosed to process workers’ compensation claims. To protect your patient’s confidentiality, only medical records related to the claim should be disclosed.\n\n【19】KEY POINTS\n\n【20】 The physician–patient relationship must be protected by protecting patient confidentiality.\n\n【21】 The legal implications of patient confidentiality have been established by common law, state law, and federal law including under the HIPAA federal regulations.\n\n【22】 There are exceptions to patient confidentiality that include the duty to warn, the duty to report reportable conditions, and the duty to inform legal guardians of the care of minors.",

        "text": "【0】CASE 39: A STIFF GREAT TOE\n\n【1】History\n\n【2】A 45-year-old woman has been experiencing a painful right great toe for 4 years. There is  删除换行1 no recall of trauma or infection, or history of gout in the great toe, but it is swollen and  删除换行1 stiff. The pain is localized to the first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint, and is aggravated  删除换行1 by activity. The woman is otherwise medically fit and well.\n\n【3】Examination\nThe first MTP joint shows no signs of erythema. There is a firm dorsal swelling over the  删除换行5 MTP joint that is tender to palpation. There is no active or passive dorsiflexion in the  删除换行1 first MTP joint. There are no signs of neurovascular deficit. Radiographs of the affected  删除换行1 toe are shown in Figs 39.1 and 39.2.\n\n【4】删除3：<u>Figure 39.1 Figure 39.2 </u>\n\n【5】Questions\n\n【6】• What is the diagnosis?\n\n【7】• What are the radiological features?\n\n【8】• What are the management options?\n\n【9】ANSWER 39\n\n【10】The diagnosis is hallux rigidus because of the stiffness and presence of dorsal osteophytes  删除换行1 seen on the radiographs. This condition encompasses mild to severe degenerative arthritis  删除换行1 of the first MTP joint of the foot. The patient complains of pain from impingement of the  删除换行1 dorsal osteophytes, especially during walking on rough ground and slopes. The patient  删除换行1 may also complain of diffuse, lateral forefoot pain resulting from increased weightbearing on the lateral foot to offload the hallux. Dorsiflexion is restricted, but the foot  删除换行1 may demonstrate compensatory hyperextension of the interphalangeal joint.\n\n【11】Hallux rigidus is the second most common condition affecting the great toe, the first  删除换行1 being hallux valgus. The condition is more common in females than males. This condition is seen in two distinct populations: those who present in adolescence and those who  删除换行1 present in adulthood. In the adolescent type, localized chondral lesions in the articular  删除换行1 surface of the metatarsal head are present. In the adult type, there is more generalized  删除换行1 arthritis.\n\n【12】Radiological features include squaring off of the first MTP joint and loss of joint space,  删除换行1 osteophytes as seen in the radiographs, cyst formation and sclerosis. The articular degenerative changes are associated with dehydration of the cartilage, which in turn is more  删除换行1 susceptible to injury resulting from shear and compressive forces. The subchondral bone  删除换行1 shares these stresses, which subsequently lead to increased subchondral bone density, formation of periarticular osteophytes and, in severe cases, cystic changes. The osteophytes  删除换行1 limit first MTP joint motion. In severe cases, the articular cartilage is completely denuded.\nInitially the management is conservative. Medication options include analgesic and  删除换行1 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Mechanical methods limiting the first  删除换行5 MTP joint motion are helpful. The use of in-shoe orthotics with medial stiffness, stiffsoled shoes with a rocker bottom, shoes with a wide toe box, low-heeled shoes, and  删除换行1 shoe modifications, such as a steel shank placed along the entire medial side, may be  删除换行1 beneficial. Activity modifications include avoiding extremes of dorsiflexion of the great  删除换行1 toe, such as those caused by kneeling or squatting with the toes in an extended position.\nManipulation combined with steroid injection into the joint can be useful in the early  删除换行1 stages of the disease.\n\n【13】Conservative management can often be used to successfully treat patients with varying  删除换行1 degrees of severity of hallux rigidus. However, in refractory cases the choice of operation depends on the degree of involvement, limitations of the range of movement, and  删除换行1 the person’s activity level. Surgical options comprising joint-sparing procedures that  删除换行1 remove the dorsal osteophyte (chielectomy) are indicated in early disease. Other surgical  删除换行1 procedures are bone-cutting (proximal phalanx and/or metatarsal osteotomy) and joint  删除换行1 replacement, which can improve joint movement and relieve pain but is not without  删除换行1 complications. Joint fusion (arthrodesis), particularly in advanced cases, provides reliable  删除换行1 results in individuals involved in strenuous activities.\n\n【14】KEY POINTS\n\n【15】• Hallux rigidus is associated with mild to severe degenerative arthritis of the first MTP \n\n【16】joint of the foot.\n\n【17】• Pain comes from impingement of the dorsal osteophytes.\n\n【18】• Hallux rigidus may present in adolescence or in adulthood.删除个例：<u>Orthopaedics</u>",

        "text": "【0】Case Files® Microbiology, Third Edition    \n\n【1】CASE 48\n-------\n\n【2】A 50-year-old woman presents to your office with the complaints of fever, chills, nausea, and vomiting for the past 5 days. She is especially concerned because she just returned from a 3-week long church mission trip to central Africa during which she did not take the recommended malaria prophylaxis. She was careful about using insect repellent and wearing long-sleeved clothing, but she did not take the recommended weekly dose of mefloquine because it made her nauseous. Starting a few days after her return, she has had episodes of shaking chills followed by fever spikes as high as 103.5°F (39.7°C) and then profuse sweating. After these episodes she would feel so exhausted that she would sleep for hours. These severe episodes have been occurring every other day. In between these episodes, she has had low-grade fever, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. On examination, she appears very fatigued and pale. Her temperature is 99.9°F (37.7°C), pulse is 100 beats/minute, blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg, and respiratory rate is 18 breaths/minute. Other than signs of dehydration, her examination is unremarkable. A complete blood count shows her to be anemic. She has elevated blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and lactate dehydrogenase levels. A thin-blood smear is sent to the laboratory, which shows erythrocytes with ring forms at the periphery of the cell and multiple erythrocytes with 3 or 4 ring forms present.\n\n【3】 What is the most likely etiology of her infection?\n\n【4】 What findings on the thin blood smear are specific for this organism?\n\n【5】### ANSWERS TO CASE 48:\n\n【6】#### Malaria\n\n【7】Summary: A 50-year-old woman has fever and body aches. A thin-blood smear shows erythrocytes with ring forms at the periphery of the cell and multiple erythrocytes with 3 or 4 ring forms.\n\n【8】• Most likely etiology of her infection: Plasmodium falciparum .\n\n【9】• Findings on the thin blood smear are specific for this organism: Multiple ring forms in a single erythrocyte and ring forms located at the periphery of the erythrocytes.\n\n【10】### CLINICAL CORRELATION\n\n【11】Malaria is caused by 1 of the 4 species of plasmodia involved in a human–mosquito–human life cycle. Plasmodia are coccidian parasites of erythrocytes. Their life cycle involves asexual reproduction in humans and sexual reproduction in the mosquito. Human infection is initiated by the bite of an infected mosquito, which introduces sporozoites into the bloodstream. The sporozoites travel to the liver, where they mature and reproduce asexually by schizogony. P. ovale and P. vivax may also establish a dormant—hypnozoite—stage in the liver; P. falciparum and P. malariae are incapable of this. On completion of the hepatic growth and reproductive stage, merozoites are released from hepatocytes and infect erythrocytes, initiating the erythrocytic cycle. Asexual reproduction continues, resulting in rupture of erythrocytes and release of more infectious merozoites. The classic symptoms of malaria relate to the paroxysm of shaking chills, fever, and sweating and correspond with the cyclical lysis of erythrocytes and release of merozoites. P. vivax, P. ovale , and P. falciparum species of malaria tend to produce paroxysms in 48-hour cycles (tertian malaria), whereas P. malariae causes paroxysms in 72-hour cycles (quartan malaria).\n\n【12】A series of paroxysms of decreasing intensity constitutes a primary malarial attack. After the primary attack, parasites tend to disappear from the blood. In infections with P. falciparum or P. malariae , this would constitute a cure. In P. vivax and P. ovale infections, relapses may occur as a result of hypnozoites persisting in the liver.\n\n【13】Complicating pathologic changes such as anemia, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly may occur. In the case of falciparum malaria, capillaries are blocked by infected erythrocytes that typically tend to become “sticky” and sequestered in capillary beds. Erythrocyte destruction leads to anemia. Capillary blockage leads to ischemia, anoxia, and subsequent organ damage. This is the basis for cerebral symptoms and kidney damage that leads to “blackwater fever,” a condition in which hemoglobin and erythrocytes appear in the urine; blackwater fever is associated with a poor prognosis. Falciparum malaria is the most virulent and lethal form of malaria, sometimes called malignant tertian malaria.\n\n【14】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【15】#### The Suspected Malaria Infection\n\n【16】### OBJECTIVES\n\n【17】1\\. Learn the life cycle of Plasmodium species and the epidemiology and clinical course of infection.\n\n【18】2\\. Describe the 3 basic aspects of infection: transmission, diagnosis, and treatment/prevention.\n\n【19】### DEFINITIONS\n\n【20】RELAPSE MALARIA: Infection derived from hypnozoites ( hypnos \\= sleeping; zo ites \\= animals) or residual liver stages that persist after a primary infection with P. vivax and P. ovale\n\n【21】APPLIQUÉ FORM: Parasite on the periphery of erythrocytes, as in P. falciparum infection\n\n【22】RING STAGE: Stage in the life cycle of Plasmodium in an erythrocyte consisting of a thin ring of protoplasm with a nucleus at one side\n\n【23】SCHIZOGONY: Asexual division or “splitting” carried out by all Plasmodium species\n\n【24】BLACKWATER FEVER: A dangerous complication of malaria, especially falciparum, characterized by passage of red to black urine and associated with high mortality\n\n【25】### DISCUSSION\n\n【26】Characteristics of Plasmodium That Impact Transmission\n\n【27】Plasmodium is a genus in the phylum Apicomplexa, which contains other human parasites such as Toxoplasma, Cryptosporidium, Cyclospora , and Isospora . All of these organisms belong to a phylogenetic class in which all species are parasitic.\n\n【28】Malaria infections are endemic in tropical developing countries. Although endogenous malaria has occurred in the United States, most cases are imported by travelers. There are numerous species of Plasmodium , but only 4 species cause human malaria— P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae , and P. ovale . All species are transmitted by an infected Anopheles mosquito. Plasmodium sporozoites are the infective forms injected into the bloodstream when the mosquito takes a blood meal. The sporozoites circulate in the bloodstream and then invade hepatocytes to initiate a pre-erythrocytic cycle. In the liver parenchymal cells, the parasite multiplies asexually by a process called schizogony or splitting. Asexual reproduction gives rise to multiple individual stages or merozoites. These merozoites become blood-borne and invade erythrocytes to initiate the erythrocytic cycle. In the case of P. vivax and P. ovale , the liver phase can be sustained for years by sporozoite-derived dormant stages known as hypnozoites. It is the presence of the hypnozoites that leads to relapses of malarial symptoms, possibly occurring several years after the first acute episode has been cured.\n\n【29】When merozoites parasitize erythrocytes, their development takes 2 routes. Merozoites develop into either micro (male) or macro (female) gametocytes. When a female Anopheles mosquito bites an infected person and ingests the gametocytes, fertilization of the macrogametocyte by the microgametocyte takes place in the mosquito with the subsequent and sequential formation of diploid zygotes, oocysts, and, eventually, sporozoites. Sporozoites travel to enter the salivary glands of the mosquito, where they are capable of initiating a new infection when the mosquito takes a blood meal. Through the second route in the erythrocytic cycle, the parasite develops successively through ring, trophozoite and schizont stages. As a result of schizogony, the erythrocyte breaks open and releases many new merozoites. These parasites then infect more erythrocytes and repeat the development cycle, ultimately causing the destruction of massive numbers of erythrocytes. The characteristic chill, fever, and sweating paroxysms occur when the parasites are released from the erythrocytes. Because the release of parasites becomes synchronized and periodic, the paroxysms are also periodic, occurring at 48 or 72 hours depending on the species. The destruction of erythrocytes and release of cell and parasite debris elicit host responses that contribute to pathologic changes.\n\n【30】### DIAGNOSIS\n\n【31】Diagnosis is made by finding the characteristic organisms on thick and thin blood smears. Differential diagnosis rests on knowing the specific morphologic characteristics of each species, which are revealed in a thin blood smear . P. vivax and P. ovale appear as ring shapes and in other advanced stages of development in enlarged erythrocytes that contain numerous granules, known as Schüffner dots. P. malariae has characteristic “band or bar” pattern and do not enlarge the host erythrocytes. P. falciparum can be identified by the presence of multiple ring forms within a single erythrocyte, in contrast to other plasmodia that will have only 1 ring form per erythrocyte. P. falciparum ring forms also tend to occur at the periphery of the erythrocyte; these “appliqué” forms are distinctive for this species. Mixed infections with more than 1 species of Plasmodium may occur.\n删除4：<u>Table 48-1 • APPEARANCE OF MALARIA PARASITES IN BLOOD SMEARS</u>\n\n【32】### TREATMENT AND PREVENTION\n\n【33】From the perspective of patient management, drugs to treat malaria fall into three categories: prophylactic, schizonticidal, and antirelapse. Prophylactics are designed to prevent infection by attacking the sporozoite stages or preventing the development of clinical symptoms by preventing schizogony in the erythrocytic cycle. Schizonticidal compounds may be used in prophylactic measures and to affect a clinical cure in an acute infection. Antirelapse drugs are directed against hypnozoite stages, as in P. vivax infection. A radical cure in P. vivax and P. ovale infections requires the use of drugs that eradicate both the erythrocytic and exoerythrocytic schizonts in the liver.\n\n【34】Chloroquine is a schizonticidal compound and with the exception of the treatment of P. falciparum derived malaria (which has developed widespread resistance to chloroquine), it is the drug of choice in treating all other clinical cases of malaria. Mefloquine, referred to in the case presentation, is used in prophylaxis and also to treat chloroquine resistant strains of Plasmodium . Drug resistance of certain strains of Plasmodium is a practical problem. For P. falciparum infections, intravenous artemisinin-derivatives such as artesunate are first-line options if available; however, if they are unavailable, then second-line drugs are quinine, chemically related mefloquine, or combination sulfadoxine (a sulfonamide)/ pyrimethamine (pyrimidine derivative). Antirelapse or tissue schizonticidal drugs are aimed at hypnozoites (liver schizonts). The drug of choice in this category is primaquine.\n\n【35】### SYNOPSIS\n\n【36】The synopsis of malaria is presented in Table 48-2 .\n删除4：<u>Table 48-2 • SYNOPSIS OF MALARIA</u>\n\n【37】###",

The symptoms were self-limiting and lasted approximately two-three weeks. Upon presentation at the campus health clinic, a blood sample tests positive for heterophil antibodies and she is diagnosed with symptomatic primary Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. Which of the following innate immune cell types plays a direct and important role in controlling the early stages of the systemic response to EBV infection?\n\n【1】> (A) Eosinophils\n\n【2】> (B) Mast cells\n\n【3】> (C) Megakaryocytes\n\n【4】> (D) Microglia\n\n【5】> (E) Natural killer cells\n\n【6】> (F) Plasma cells\n\n【7】> (G) Regulatory T lymphocytes\n\n【8】 Answer: The correct answer is E . Natural killer (NK) cells are a component of the innate immune system. These cells have a battery of germline-encoded activating and inhibitory receptors that can detect and distinguish virally infected cells from uninfected cells. For example, virally infected cells often express less major histocompatibility complex class I on their surface, and this absence is detected by the NK cell. Detection of a virally infected cell signals the NK cell to release cytotoxic granules onto the infected cell; thus they play a direct and important role in controlling the early stages of systemic response to viral infection. NK cells express CD16 and CD56 among other markers. It should be noted that individuals with defective NK cell function are particularly susceptible to herpes virus infection. This suggests that NK cells play an important, non-redundant physiologic function in the control of this family of viral infections. EBV binds to CD21 on B lymphocytes, which become infected. In addition to the NK cell-mediated response, CD8+ T lymphocytes mediate the main cellular immune response to this infection.  \nAnswer A is incorrect . Eosinophils are important effector cells in host defense against parasites.  \nAnswer B is incorrect . Mast cells control the early inflammatory response by release of potent vasoactive granules.  \nAnswer C is incorrect . Megakaryocytes are resident bone marrow cells that give rise to platelets.  \nAnswer D is incorrect . Microglia are tissue macrophages located within the CNS and do not play as direct a role in the control of systemic viral infections as natural killer cells do.  \nAnswer F is incorrect . Plasma cells are antibody-producing B lymphocytes and an important component of the adaptive immune system.  \nAnswer G is incorrect . Regulatory T lymphocytes are components of the adaptive immune response that suppress effector T-lymphocyte functions in both an antigen-specific and antigen-nonspecific manner.",

Do not make any changes.\n\n【11】ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS\n\n【12】9.1 B. Previously， it was thought that tidal volumes (V ) of 10 to 15 mL/kg were required to prevent atelectasis during MV； however， these higher volumes are no longer used. The Surviving Sepsis Guidelines recommend a strategy of low-volume ventilation using a V of6 to 8 mL/kg with a plateau pressure <30 mmHg H，O. This method is referred to as low-volume ventilation and is very effective in supporting patients with sepsis and ARDS. The best initial V is approximately480 mL using 6 mL/kg. The arterial pH should be kept at 7.20 or higher. Bicar-bonate treatment should only be considered when the pH is below 7.20. This low-volume ventilation method is effective in preventing and treating ARDS. Sedation will be needed for patient comfort with this method.\n\n【13】9.2 A. Increased PEEP or auto PEEP increases the intrathoracic pressure (ITP)， and decreases venous return to the heart. This reduces right ventricular filling and can decrease cardiac output， leading to hypotension. Attempts should be made to increase expiratory time to decrease auto PEEP. With severe hypoten-sion due to auto PEEP， disconnecting the patient from the MV and allowing a long expiration will generally correct the hypotension. Lowering the auto PEEP levels can be achieved by decreasing the respiratory rate， decreasing the tidal volume， and increasing the expiratory time. Giving IV fluids and expand ing the intravascular space helps reverse the decreased preload and assists in restoring the blood pressure by restoring intravascular and right ventricular fill-ing volume.\n\n【14】CLINICAL PEARLS\n\n【15】Low-volume ventilation is important in patients with ARDS to prevent alveolar barotrauma.\n\n【16】PPressure support ventilation (PSV) helps reduce the need for sedation.\n\n【17】Acid suppression with proton-pump inhibitors or histamine-2 (H，) block-ers heightens the risk for resistant bacterial pneumonia in hospitalized patients， PPI more than H， blockers.\n\n【18】PPSV increases patient comfort and resistance to spontaneous respiration by patient.\n\n【19】Avoid neuromuscular blockade since this is associated with long-term neurological defects.\n\n【20】Do not change the plastic circuitry of MV unless needed. Unnecessary changing of tubing increases the rate of infection.\n\n【21】The use of artificial noses for humidification in MV circuitry reduces the risk of waterborne respiratory infections compared with the use of inline humidifiers.\n\n【22】Volumetric diffusive percussive respiration (VDR) enables clearance of copious secretions resulting from smoke inhalation and patients with cystic fibrosis.",

Most hairs (80%–90%) on the scalp at any given moment are in the anagen phase and thus, patients can experience a uniform loss of hair of this magnitude. The most common cause of anagen effluvium is classically seen in those undergoing chemotherapy, as dividing cells display high metabolic activity and thus take up the drug more rapidly, but other medications and inflammatory disorders have also been implicated. Hair loss in anagen effluvium is often reversible as the quiescent stem cells responsible for the initiation of follicular regrowth are unharmed. Removal of the offending agent or treatment of the implicated conditions often results in resolution and regrowth. The clinical picture with a thorough history and physical exam is key for diagnosis but clinicians may also rely on laboratory techniques such as microscopy and even biopsy for an anagen-to-telogen ratio. Management is centered around patient education, coping strategies, and decreasing the duration and amount of hair loss experienced. Patient education should focus on the natural course and likely reversibility of hair loss as well as daily preventative measures including grooming strategies and hair care. While these aid in the management of both psychological and emotional distress these patients may experience, it is important to assure social support and to offer counseling appropriately. With appropriate use, external devices, such as scalp cooling, which induces vasoconstriction, and scalp tourniquet application, which clamps arteries supplying the scalp, have been shown to reduce the degree of hair loss. Medical intervention, with agents such as minoxidil, which induces arterial vasodilation, may be used topically to promote hair growth but does not prevent hair loss.\n\n【11】Keywords\n\n【12】Anagen effluvium Non-cicatricial Alopecia Chemotherapy Scalp cooling Minoxidil\n\n【13】A 55-year-old female presented with almost complete loss of hair on the scalp and the rest of the body, including her eyebrows and eyelashes.

The toxic insults most commonly occur from medications, especially chemotherapy, but it also occurs with other inflammatory insults. As a result, AE has become synonymous with chemotherapy-induced alopecia (CIA) as other causes are rare and often not considered unless indicated by the clinical picture. AE in the context of drug-administration can be classified within drug-induced alopecia. Drug-administration and inflammatory conditions may also cause patients significant distress, so, in these scenarios, it is important to differentiate AE from telogen effluvium (TE) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【27】The inflammatory or toxic insult in AE results in diffuse hair loss as 90% of hairs on a scalp are in the anagen phase. The anagen phase, or growth phase, of the hair cycle lasts between 2 and 6 years during which epithelial proliferation of the bulb matrix cells forms the hair shaft. Consequently, these cells demonstrate both high metabolic activity and pigmentation which leaves them particularly susceptible to insult 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. This insult disrupts epithelial proliferation, and impedes cellular mitosis at the bulb matrix, damaging the shaft, and ultimately resulting in hair breakage or loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. This results in rapid, diffuse hair loss, often greater than 100 hairs per day over a period of 2–4 weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. However, since the quiescent stem cells that continue to initiate follicle growth are spared, hair loss is usually completely reversible 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】AE is most commonly seen in patients receiving cytotoxic therapy. Shedding occurs in approximately 65% of patients using these therapies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. Patients may begin to experience shedding within 14 days of administration of the offending agent and complete hair loss within 1 or 2 months of continued exposure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 5 \\]</u>. Most common medication culprits include chemotherapy agents which inhibit cellular proliferation of anagen hairs, causing apoptosis of the proximal bulb region 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Anti-microtubules, topoisomerase inhibitors, alkylating agents, and antimetabolites have been associated with alopecia with an occurrence of 80%, 60%–100%, greater than 60%, and 10%–50% respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 4 \\]</u>. Other less commonly implicated agents include isoniazid, levodopa, colchicine, cyclosporine, tamoxifen, allopurinol, bromocriptine, high-dose albendazole, and radiation therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 5 , 7 , 8 \\]</u>. AE secondary to these therapies is typically a reversible process that occurs naturally 1–3 months after the removal of the offending agent; however, while CIA is thought to follow this same pattern, recent studies have linked certain classes of chemotherapy to irreversible alopecia or permanent chemotherapy-induced alopecia (PCIA) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. One study reported an incidence of 42.3% of PCIA in patients 3 years after undergoing chemotherapy, with taxane-based agents being the most offending 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. This has also been reported with patients undergoing radiation therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】Heavy metals, such as thallium and mercury, are able to disrupt hair shaft formation by binding the sulphydryl group of keratins in the hair. Other heavy metals reported to be associated with AE include boron, and arsenic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Patients would demonstrate systemic symptoms associated with toxic levels of the varying heavy metals as well as elevated blood levels.\n\n【30】Associated medical conditions include autoimmune and inflammatory disorders and severe malnutrition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 5 \\]</u>. Lymphocytes seen in alopecia areata infiltrate the hair follicle which causes the rapid progression from anagen to catagen and telogen and then back to the anagen phase. This continuous cycle changes the follicle’s morphology into a short, incompletely keratinized or pencil point hair that is sensitive to trauma and breakage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. With pemphigus vulgaris, the autoantibodies disrupt hair growth as desmosomal proteins are expressed in the follicle epithelium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Recently, there have also been case reports of COVID-19 related anagen effluvium associated with an urticaria and maculopapular rash that was associated with the massive inflammatory insult related to the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】Diagnosis of AE is typically made through history and physical exam. On examination, areas of hair loss will show no signs of active inflammation or scarring such as erythema, scaling, or pigmentation seen in cicatricial alopecia, but will show diffuse hair loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Patients retaining 10%–20% of hair in a uniform distribution is highly specific for AE, especially in the context of association with one of the previously listed medications or medical conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. Microscopy may be helpful to differentiate between conditions, such as TE, which presents with clumping, non-uniform distribution of hair loss with the onset of a significant life stressor, such as chemotherapy induction or systemic disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Microscopically, anagen hairs have full pigmentation with roots covered with inner and outer root sheaths, whereas telogen hairs lack inner and outer root sheaths, as well as pigmentation of the proximal shaft 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. AE hairs will characteristically demonstrate a narrowing, fractured shaft as well 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. A biopsy is rarely required for diagnosis but would show a low (15%) anagen-to-telogen ratio, differentiating it from TE. Follicles would also show no signs of inflammation, dystrophy of the inner sheath, or traction, distinguishing AE from alopecia areata, androgenic alopecia, and traction alopecia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【32】Treatment\n---------\n\n【33】Treatment of anagen effluvium is multifaceted, including decreasing the total quantity of hair loss, decreasing the overall duration of hair loss, increasing patient coping ability, and educating patients on the treatment course. Prior to the development of more current, promising treatments, management largely focused on patient education and the use of aesthetic devices. Patients may still choose this form of management but with the emergence of scalp cooling devices and hair growth medications, these may be utilized less often 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Current research is largely aimed at eliminating hair loss completely but has largely been unremarkable. Recent clinical trials have shown methods that decrease but do not eliminate hair loss. Cessation of implicating medications and treatment or the resolution of implicating medical conditions has been the only method to lead to complete resolution of anagen effluvium. Reports show that regrowth is scarce and less likely to occur in patients receiving high doses of radiation therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>.\n\n【34】Patient education has been at the forefront of management for patients experiencing or may be experiencing it in the future as many patients experience emotional and psychological distress 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. It is imperative to educate patients not only on the probability of hair loss, but also on the current recommendations, course, and reversibility of it 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Recommendations for hair care before and during treatment include avoiding physical and chemical trauma to the scalp and hair (bleach, color, perm, irons, rollers) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 4 \\]</u>. Other recommendations include scarcely washing hair and the use of a satin pillowcase. Patients should be educated on coping strategies such as keeping their hair shorter, as this helps it appear fuller, as well as considering the use of an aesthetic covering, such as a hairpiece, wig, or scarf 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. These have the added benefit of scalp protection from sun and cold exposure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【35】Currently, the mainstay of treatment for medication-induced AE has been to reduce the quantity of offending agent delivered to the scalp follicles. This can be done with the application of a scalp tourniquet, clamping arteries, or inducing scalp hypothermia, causing arteriolar vasoconstriction. These techniques are especially effective for chemotherapy agents that have short half-lives and are rapidly cleared 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【36】Scalp cooling has been well-studied and is shown to be highly effective in significantly reducing this effect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Influencing factors include the type and dose of medication, as well as the degree of scalp temperature reduction. Studies have shown beneficial outcomes with temperature reduction below 22 degrees Celsius 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. Mechanically, scalp cooling would be beneficial to reduce the delivery of any systemic medication to the scalp, with most evidence shown through studies in breast-cancer patients on anthracycline therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 , 18 \\]</u>. Therefore, the lowest efficacious dose would likely have the lowest risk of inducing AE. Studies have also looked at specific cooling systems, such as the Paxman PCS-2 (PAX). This system is most efficacious at reducing the risk of AE when used with a cold cap (CC) during therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. With the emergence and efficacy of this intervention, there is an enormous potential to ease the psychological burden of this unpleasant side effect and improve patient quality of life as some patients report treatment hesitancy and decline it in fear of hair loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 20 \\]</u>. Common adverse effects include a sensation of cold, scalp discomfort, and headaches 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 19 \\]</u>. Scalp cooling is contraindicated in patients with hematological malignancies due to its mechanism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【37】Scalp tourniquet devices have been shown to be effective in preventing hair loss in some studies, but populations and techniques have not been uniform, needing to account for different techniques, type of chemotherapy regimen, and amount of external pressure applied 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u>. While generally tolerated, side effects include headache and varying degrees of nerve compression that can induce scalp anesthesia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 17 \\]</u>. Contraindications include any brain or scalp metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【38】Pharmacological intervention is largely employed to reduce the severity and duration of hair loss experienced by patients. Topical minoxidil has been shown to reduce the period of baldness by about 50 days but does not prevent alopecia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 , 17 \\]</u>. While minoxidil does induce local vasodilation to the scalp arteries when applied topically, the leading mechanism for which this drug stimulates hair growth include the increased activity of enzymes, such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase or sulfotransferase, but this is not fully understood 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 , 22 \\]</u>. It has a good safety profile and tolerability with scalp pruritus being the most common side effect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 \\]</u>. Due to the mechanism of arterial vasodilation, its use is only recommended after the discontinuation of the implicating agent or condition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【39】Numerous agents, such as small molecules, biologicals, and medications have shown promise in preliminary studies but failed larger clinical trials. These include keratinocyte growth factor, and combinations of topical dexamethasone, calcitriol, and calcipotriol or calcineurin inhibitors, interleukin-1, and calcitriol 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【40】Key Points\n----------\n\n【41】   Anagen effluvium is diffuse hair loss caused by toxic or inflammatory insult to hair follicles during the anagen phase of the hair cycle.\n   Toxic insult from patients undergoing treatment with chemotherapeutic agents is the most common cause of anagen effluvium, but other medications and inflammatory conditions have been implicated.\n   Patient management is centered around patient education and coping strategies, as well as decreasing the duration of hair loss through mechanical and pharmacological interventions.\n   Minoxidil is the mainstay of pharmacological therapy while the application of scalp cooling and tourniquets have shown benefit as external devices during chemotherapy treatment.",

The CBC will rule out systemic illness and give a picture of general health. The comprehensive metabolic panel will show Fred's diabetes control， kidney and liver function， and fluid status. The lipid profile will evaluate the status of his hyperlip-idemia， while the urine studies will evaluate several aspects of Fred's diabetes control. The serum testosterone will evaluate for hypogonadism.\n\n【43】Relevant test results for Fred include a free testosterone level of 128ng/dL. Normal levels for a young adult male are 300-1000ng/dL. In men older than 60 years with signs or symptoms of andro-gen deficiency， a total testosterone level below 200ng/dL is almost always clinically significant.\n\n【44】What is the most likely differential diagnosis and why?\n\n【45】Secondary hypogonadism：\n\n【46】Given the objective report of clinically significant low testosterone， we can conclude that Fred has secondary hypogonadism. This explains his decreased sexual function， along with his lowered con-centration and impaired mood.\n\n【47】However， looking further into the constellation of Fred’s symptoms and conditions， it becomes evident that there is interplay of many factors. Fred's uncontrolled diabetes is a wildcard， as it can also contribute to his decline in sexual function. The problem is autonomic neuropathy that results from failure of the small vessels that lead to vasodilation. In addition， it is known that obesity leads to lower free and total testosterone levels. Adding in Fred's probable depressive syndrome completes the clinical picture that shows many overlaps in symptoms. However， an objective diagnosis of hypogonadism can be confidently made considering the laboratory results. Diagnosis is made via evaluation of serum testosterone levels.\n\n【48】It is known that blood concentrations of testosterone and prehormones are significantly lower in older men than younger men， as they begin a gradual decline at midlife. In aging men who have not always had symptoms， hypogonadism is referred to as secondary， since the problem is not a primary dysfunction of the testes. Signs and symptoms of secondary hypogonadism due to aging include decreased muscle mass and strength， decreased bone mass， decreased libido (desire)， erectile dysfunc-tion， impaired mood， and impaired sense of well-being.\n\n【49】The diagnosis of male sexual dysfunction can include any or all of the following categories： 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> decreased libido， 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> erectile dysfunction， 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> ejaculatory insufficiency， or 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> impaired orgasm. Fred reports both decreased libido and erectile dysfunction， which can have several different etiologies. Decreased libido can occur due to psychogenic factors， medications， androgen deficiency， substance use or abuse， or central nervous system disease. Erectile dysfunction can occur due to psychogenic factors， medications， endocrine disorders， aging， or systemic illness. Diagnosis is generally made on subjective reporting， and treatment is symptom based.\n\n【50】Fred reports being on antidepressants in the past， which alludes to a previous diagnosis of depres-sive disorder. Today， Fred's report of altered mood， fatigue， sexual dysfunction， poor concentration， substance use， and personal stressors all suggest the possibility of a depressive syndrome.\n\n【51】What is your plan of treatment?\n\n【52】As an initial approach to Fred's low testosterone， an appropriate treatment is testosterone therapy. There are several different administration modalities， including intramuscular (IM) injections， skin patches， and transdermal gel preparations. IM injection is widely used and is an appropriate choice for Fred. The recommended dose is 150-200mg IM every 2-3 weeks. The testosterone transdermal patch delivers 5mg of testosterone daily but has a high incidence of skin irritation. There are other patch preparations that are larger and cause less irritation， but they may have a tendency to fall off with activity. The transdermal testosterone gel is widely used and the dosage is 5-10 mg of 1% tes-tosterone gel applied daily. It causes little skin irritation， though there is a possibility for transfer through direct skin contact. Since Fred has difficulty with daily medication compliance， bringing him to the clinic for routine injections is a wise choice.\n\n【53】In adjunct to testosterone therapy， Fred should be educated about medication compliance. Explaining to him the importance of diabetes control and the interplay of his numerous symptoms may be an effective approach.\n\n【54】Since Fred will be coming to the office for routine injections to start， there will be opportunities to reassess his symptoms. There will also be an opportunity to assess whether Fred or his spouse should 删除换行1 be instructed in injection administration. Follow-up intervals should occur between every 4 and 6months to evaluate progress， symptoms， and blood levels. Blood levels should be drawn periodically to evaluate whether his serum testosterone has returned to normal levels. Therapy could continue for as long as 3-4 years.\n\n【55】Are there any referrals needed?\n\n【56】Education about diet and exercise should be reinforced； and， if he is willing， he should be given a referral for nutritional counseling.\n\n【57】What would be relative and absolute contraindications to the treatment plan of testosterone therapy?\n\n【58】Testosterone therapy is absolutely contraindicated in those with carcinoma of the prostate or of the male breast， as these cancers require androgens for proliferation. Testosterone therapy should be used with caution in older men with enlarged prostates， with urinary symptoms， or elevated hematocrit.\n\n【59】Are there standardized guidelines that would help in this case?\n\n【60】The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists Medical Guidelines for Clinical Practice for the Evaluation and Treatment of Hypogonadism in Adult Male Patients—2002 Update. 通用删除1(英):<u>(删除9：<u>http：//www. aace.com/pub/pdf/guidelines/hypogonadism.pdf)</u></u>",

A computed tomographic scan of the thorax (CT thorax) revealed mass in the  删除换行4 anterior segment of the left upper lobe with irregular margins measuring 4 × 5 × 3 cm in  删除换行1 size and a pleural effusion on the left side. The lesion was infiltrating the pleura. There was  删除换行1 also present a large mass with irregular margins in the prevascular region of the anterior  删除换行1 mediastinum infiltrating the mediastinal pleura.

The patient had also  删除换行1 complained of backache and hence we carried out an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 删除换行1 of the spine which revealed a diffuse and patchy altered signal intensity with the collapse  删除换行1 of sixth cervical and first lumbar vertebra, with the picture suggestive of diffuse marrow  删除换行1 infiltration indicative of multiple myeloma (MM) 删除33：<u></u>. His skull X-ray revealed  删除换行1 multiple lytic lesions. Serum protein electrophoresis was done which revealed raised  删除换行1 total proteins (11 g/dL) (normal 6.5–8.5 g/dL) with normal albumin, α1, α2, ad β globulin  删除换行1 but markedly raised g globulin (5 g/dL) (normal 0.75–1.8 g/dL), and the electrophoresis  删除换行1 showed an M-spike.

Myeloma  删除换行1 cells found at the extramedullary site may thus either be due to extramedullary  删除换行1 plasmacytoma or due to extramedullary dissemination of MM. Extramedullary  删除换行1 plasmacytoma is a variant of MM. It usually involves submucosal lymphoid tissues  删除换行1 of nasopharynx or paranasal sinuses without bone marrow involvement. It is highly  删除换行1 responsive to local irradiation and has excellent prognosis. Extramedullary dissemination  删除换行1 of MM occurs in advanced disease but is a rare phenomenon. The sites of extramedullary  删除换行1 dissemination reported in the literature are spleen, liver, lymph nodes, kidneys, thyroid  删除换行1 gland, adrenal gland, ovary, testes, lung, pleura, pericardium, intestinal tract, and skin.\nLung involvement is extremely rare. In fact, it is so rare that in one large case series of  删除换行1 869 cases, there was no mention of lung involvement. Shin et al. had described two cases  删除换行1 of extramedullary plasmacytoma involving the lung parenchyma. The first case had  删除换行1 a mass lesion in the right infrahilar region while the second case had reticulonodular  删除换行1 opacities in the lower zones of both lungs. The first case did not have generalized  删除换行1 myelomatosis but he developed it 5 years after treatment, namely, local radiotherapy,  删除换行1 while the second case had generalized myelomatosis. Because it is a disorder of the aged  删除换行1 population, with its severe clinical course and heterogeneous symptoms, the diagnosis  删除换行1 is difficult. This disorder presents primarily in the elderly with organ dysfunctions and  删除换行1 symptoms such as bone pains, renal dysfunction, anemia, susceptibility to infections,  删除换行1 hypercalcemia, hyperviscosity, and neurological manifestations. The most frequent  删除换行1 thoracic involvement by MM is pulmonary infiltrate secondary to an infectious process.\nIn our patient, after encountering atypical plasma cells in lung parenchyma, we first  删除换行1 investigated in order to find out whether he was having extramedullary plasmacytoma  删除换行1 or MM with extramedullary dissemination since the treatment and prognosis of  删除换行1 these two conditions are vastly different. For the diagnosis of MM, at least two of the  删除换行1 following three criteria should be present: Marrow plasmacytosis, lytic bone lesions,  删除换行1 and M component, i.e. monoclonal immunoglobulin in blood and/or urine. In our 100 Cases in Pulmonary Medicine Pulmonary and Nodal Multiple Myeloma with a Pleural Effusion.\n\n【7】patient, all the three were present. In a recent study to investigate the causes, and the  删除换行1 frequency and the effects of prognosis of the pulmonary involvement, it was found that  删除换行1 the cases with pulmonary involvement were associated with progressive diseases, which  删除换行1 included mainly renal failure and pathological bone fractures. Despite advances in the  删除换行1 management of MM in the past few decades, it remains an incurable disease. The disease  删除换行1 follows a relapsing course in majority of patients, regardless of the treatment regimen  删除换行1 or initial response to treatment. Traditionally, newly diagnosed myeloma patients have  删除换行1 been classified as either transplant or nontransplant candidates. This classification  删除换行1 is based on a number of factors including age, performance status, comorbid medical  删除换行1 conditions, and patient performance. Transplant candidates were typically treated  删除换行1 with nonalkylating agents to prevent marrow damage. Nontransplant candidates often  删除换行1 received alkylating agent-based therapy (most oncologists prefer cyclophosphamide or  删除换行1 melphalan as an alkylating agent with prednisolone). However, cyclophosphamide is  删除换行1 preferred more because it is less toxic to the bone marrow. These agents are administered  删除换行1 over 4 days every 4 weeks till the disease reaches a plateau phase which is defined as  删除换行1 the phase when patient’s hemoglobin, paraprotein, and beta-2 microglobulin levels have  删除换行1 become stable, and the patient is asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic over a period  删除换行1 of at least 3 months. Lately, a high-dose alkylating agent with hematopoietic support has  删除换行1 been used. It has improved the remission rate from <10–50%. However, such therapy is  删除换行1 suitable for younger patients only. Recently, the management of patients with MM has  删除换行1 been transformed by introduction of three novel agents: Thalidomide, lenalidomide, and  删除换行1 bortezomib. We have reported the above case in order to demonstrate variability in the  删除换行1 presentation of MM.",

She has had head-aches since she was a teenager， but they have become more debilitating recently The episodes occur once or twice each month and last for up to 2 days. The pain begins in the right temple or at the back ofthe right eye and spreads to the entire scalp over a few hours. She describes the pain as a sharp， throbbing sensation that gradually worsens and is associated with severe nausea. Several factors aggravate the pain， including loud noises and movement. She has taken several over-the-counter medications for the pain， but the only thing that works is going to sleep in a quiet， darkened room. A thorough history reveals that her mother suffers from migraine headaches. Her vital signs， general physical examination， and a thor-ough neurologic examination are all within normal limits.\n\n【2】What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【3】What imaging study is most appropriate at this time?\n\n【4】What are the most appropriate therapeutic options?\n\n【5】 34：Summary： A 33-year-old woman presents with headaches that are throbbing and over her right eye. Her headaches have occurred since she was a teenager and have progressively worsened. She has not found relief from over-the-counter preparations.1\\. Know the differential diagnosis of chronic headache.\n\n【6】2\\. Learn the “red flag”'symptoms and signs that should prompt rapid， specific diagnostic and treatment interventions.\n\n【7】3\\. Know how to manage common headache syndromes.The patient described in the case has symptoms that are very characteristic of classic migraines without aura. Her headaches are unilateral， throbbing in nature， and have been progressively worsening. Migraine headaches are the most common headaches of vascular origin and the second most common cause of headaches overall. Migraines are a member of a group of primary headache syndromes dif-ferentiated by their associated features. Migraines typically cause recurrent epi-sodes of headache， nausea， and vomiting. They can also be associated with other neurologic symptoms such as photophobia， light-headedness，paresthesias， vertigo， and visual disturbances. In the patient described in this case， the history and lack of physical findings can reasonably lead to the diagnosis of migraine headaches without aura (“common migraine\")， the most frequently occurring form. Other classifications of migraines include migraine with aura (“classic migraine\")， oph-thalmoplegic migraine， retinal migraine， and childhood periodic syndromes that may be precursors to or associated with migraines. During the evaluation of this patient， the focus should be on determining the etiology of the headache， assessing for any red flags  that may indicate worse pathologic causes， identify-ing triggers， and therapy for the condition.\n\n【8】According to the International Headache Society， symptoms diagnostic of migraine headache  include moderate to severe headache with a pulsating quality； unilateral location； nausea and/or vomiting； photophobia；\n\n| Table 34-1·“RED FLAG”SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS IN THE EVALUATION OF  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| HEADACHES  |  |  |\n| Red Flag  | Differential Diagnosis  | Workup Studies  |\n| Sudden-onset maximum severityworst headache”or new anddifferent headache  | Subarachnoid hemorrhage， pituitary apoplexy，hemorrhageinto a mass lesion or vascular malformation，mass lesion  | Neuroimaging first；lumbar puncture if neuroimaging negative  |\n| Headaches increasing in severityand frequency， brought on byValsalva or physical exertion  | Mass lesion，subdural hematoma，medication overuse  | Neuroimaging，drugscreen  |\n| Headache beginning afterage 50；especially if jaw pain onchewing (jaw claudication)  | Temporal arteritis， mass lesion  | Neuroimaging，erythro-cyte sedimentation ratelevel  |\n| New-onset headache in patientwith risk factors for HIV infectionor cancer  | Meningitis，brain abscess (includ-ing toxoplasmosis)， metastasis  | Neuroimaging first；lumbar puncture if neuroimaging negative  |\n| Headache with signs of systemicillness (fever， stiff neck， rash)  | Meningitis，encephalitis， Lyme dis-ease， systemic infection， collagenvascular disease  | Neuroimaging，lumbarpuncture，serology  |\n| Focal neurologic signs or symptoms of disease (other thantypical aura)  | Mass lesion， vascular malforma-tion， stroke，collagen vasculardisease  | Neuroimaging，collagenvascular evaluation including antiphospho-lipid antibodies)  |\n| Papilledema  | Mass lesion，pseudotumor cerebri，meningitis  | Neuroimaging，lumbarpuncture  |\n| Headache subsequent to headtrauma  | Intracranial hemorrhage，subduralhematoma，epidural hematoma，posttraumatic headache  | Neuroimaging of brain，skull， and cervical spine  |\n删除23：<u>Data from South-Paul JE， Matheny SC， Iewis EL， et al.

These headaches are usually episodic； however， a small subset may have chronic headaches.</u>\nCHRONIC DAILYHEADACHE： Experiencing headache on 15 days or more per month. Chronic daily headache (CDH) is not a single entity； it can encompass a number of headache syndromes， including chronic tension headaches， migraines， infection， inflammation，trauma， and medication overuse.Status： A severe headache that has lasted more than 72 hours.A patient with symptoms and signs consistent with migraine and who does not have any “red flag”findings 删除25：<u></u> does not require any further testing prior to instituting treatment. Neuroimaging should be performed if there is an unexplained neurologic abnormality on examination or if the headache syndrome is not typical of either migraines or some other primary headache disorder. The presence of rapidly increasing headache frequency or a history of either lack of coor-dination， focal neurologic symptom， or headache awakening the patient from sleep raises the likelihood of finding an abnormality on an imaging test. Magnetic reso-nance imaging (MRI) may be more sensitive than computed tomography (CT) scanning for the identification of abnormalities， but it may not be more sensitive at identifying significant abnormalities. CT scanning would be initial imaging for“thunderclap\"headaches where intracranial bleeds are considered. Other testing(eg， blood tests， electroencephalogram \\[EEG\\]) should only be performed for diag-nostic purposes ifthere is a suspicion based on the history or physical examination.The goal of therapy in migraine prophylaxis is a reduction in the severity and frequency of headache by 50% or more. Options for pharmacologic treatment and prophylaxis of migraines are listed in Tables 34-3 and 34-4， respectively.Tension headache is the most prevalent form of primary headache disorder， typically presenting with pericranial muscle tenderness and a description of a bilateral band-like distribution of the pain. Headaches can last from 30 minutes to 7 days and there is no aggravation by walking stairs or similar routine physi-cal activity. There is no associated nausea or vomiting. Both photophobia and phonophobia are absent， or one， but not the other， is present. They can be either episodic (<180 d/y) or chronic (>180 d/y).\n\nInitial medical therapy of episodic tension-type headache includes aspirin， acet-aminophen， and NSAIDs. Combination analgesics containing caffeine are second-line options.

Which of the following is the most appropriate management at this time?\n\n【1】A. Counsel the patient on the high likelihood of gross hematuria after a urologic procedure and that this will likely subside. Let him know no test is required today.\n\n【2】B. Do a urine dipstick first. If positive then proceed to urinalysis with microscopy and have the patient return in a few weeks for a repeat UA with microscopy.\n\n【3】C. Discuss with the patient the high likelihood of malignancy with gross hematuria especially given his age and past history and recommend imaging upper and lower urinary tracts.\n\n【4】D. Tell him that he likely needs urine cytology today to rule out malignancy.\n\n【5】14.2 A 54-year-old postmenopausal woman with past medical history of hyper-tension is incidentally found to have significant microscopic hematuria on a UA that was done as part of her annual hypertension laboratory tests. She denies dysuria， gross hematuria， fevers， chills， and nausea/ vomiting. Her physical examination is negative for suprapubic tenderness and flank pain. What would be the next best step in the management of this patient?\n\n【6】A.Repeat UA with microscopy in 3 months at her next follow-up visit for hypertension.\n\n【7】B. Perform a urine culture and if positive， treat immediately. Repeat UA posttreatment.\n\n【8】C.Order renal function testing to rule out medical renal disease as an etiology.\n\n【9】D. Repeat UA with microscopy in 6 weeks.\n\n【10】14.33 A 65-year-old man with past medical history of hypertension， coronary artery disease， chronic kidney disease (CKD)， and a pacemaker presents to your office with complaint ofdark urine\"for many weeks now. He states he has been evaluated by several other physicians who had done“several tests”that all came back negative. He states he has never had any imaging done and would like you to“take a look at what is going on in there?Upon accessing his medical records you see that he has already had several UA with microscopy that were all positive for microscopic hematuria， renal function testing， which is significant for elevated BUN and creatinine and decreased GFR， and nega-tive urine cultures. At this time， what would be the most appropriate imaging modality and management for this patient?\n\n【11】A1.Counsel the patient against imaging at this time as any imaging may worsen his CKD.\n\n【12】B. Order magnetic resonance urography (MRU) as the patient is unable to undergo CT urography given his renal insufficiency， along with an urgent urology referral.\n\n【13】C.Order a combined renal ultrasound and retrograde pyelogram for maxi-mum visualization of upper urinary tract， along with an urgent urology referral.\n\n【14】D. Order urine cytology and urine markers as these are the least invasive test of choice at this time.\n\n【15】ANSWERS\n\n【16】14.11B. Although it is very likely that the patients hematuria is secondary to the recent urologic procedure， it is not a good practice to simply assume the cause and not do appropriate initial evaluation for hematuria， like one would for any patient with that chief complaint. The initial step in this case would be to do a urine dipstick， which if positive in office， would warrant a UA with microscopy. If this shows 3 or more RBCs per HPF， one would immediately go to thorough workup. However， if UA with microscopy shows fewer than3 RBCs per HPF， the patient should be asked to return in 6 weeks for a repeat. It is appropriate to discuss with the patient that his gross hematu-ria， given his lack of risk factors for malignancy， is most likely caused by the recent bladder catheterization； however， as stated earlier， this is not a reason to dismiss further evaluation. Since there is a probable cause for this patient’s hematuria， one would not immediately begin workup to rule out malignancy. Certainly， if his gross hematuria continues after several weeks， it would be imperative to conduct further evaluation.\n\n【17】14.2I D. This patient does not have signs or symptoms of a UTI and additional workup looking for an infection is not going to change management， as asymptomatic bacteriuria need not be treated except in pregnancy. As per the current guidelines， this patient needs a repeat UA with microscopy in 6 weeks before beginning workup to rule out medical renal disease. A 3-month inter val between repeat UA testing is not an appropriate interval.\n\n【18】14.3删除38：<u>(</u>C. This patient has two simultaneous contraindications to imaging modali-ties preferred in the workup of microscopic hematuria. Due to his renal insufficiency he should not get a CT urography， and due to his pacemaker， he should not undergo MRI/MRU. For this reason， the next best imaging modality would have to be done， a renal ultrasound， which when combined with a retrograde pyelogram would provide maximum information about the upper urinary tracts. This would have to be done with a concurrent urology referral. Urine cytology and urine markers， although noninvasive， are not cur-rently recommended in the routine evaluation of microscopic hematuria.\nCLINICALPEARLS\n\n【19】Hematuria in adults should always be evaluated. If no source is found on a thorough initial workup，patients should be followed for at least 3 years to monitor for an underlying condition. In every case ofa first-time microscopic hematuria， a repeat urinalysis with microscopy is required at 6--wWeeek interval before any other manage-ment is done.\n删除20：<u>Cohen RA， Brown RS.

Examination of the pharynx reveals a cherry-red mass at the base of the tongue. The vaccine that could have prevented this child’s illness contains two parts: purified bacterial capsule and mutant diphtheria toxoid. Which of the following characteristics of the causative organism makes necessary the addition of the diphtheria toxoid to the vaccine?\n\n【1】> (A) Attachment pili\n\n【2】> (B) Gram-negative rod\n\n【3】> (C) IgA protease\n\n【4】> (D) Polyribitol-ribose phosphate capsule\n\n【5】> (E) Protein A\n\n【6】 Answer: The correct answer is D. This child is suffering from acute epiglottitis, caused by Haemophilus influenzae type B (HiB). The incidence of this illness has decreased drastically in recent years because of immunization efforts. The HiB vaccine consists of two parts: the bacterial capsule antigen and diphtheria toxoid protein. Because the bacterial capsule is a polysaccharide, it alone will not generate a sufficient immune response. Therefore, a protein (the toxoid) is added to the vaccine in order to generate an antibody response.  \nAnswer A is incorrect. Whereas attachment pili are an important virulence factor of H influenzae , they are not the reason why the vaccine must contain a toxoid protein.  \nAnswer B is incorrect. Whereas H influenzae is a gram-negative rod, its Gram stain characteristics do not play a role in the body’s ability to generate antibodies against it.  \nAnswer C is incorrect. IgA protease is an important virulence factor in H influenzae . It functions to cleave IgA, which allows the bacteria to colonize the mucosa. It does not, however, play a role in vaccination.  \nAnswer E is incorrect. H influenzae does not generate protein A. This is a virulence factor found in Staphylococcus aureus that binds the Fc portion of IgG and thus helps prevent opsonization.",

The  删除换行1 lesions have slowly been increasing in size and number over the last two years and are  删除换行1 mainly asymptomatic. The lesions were treated with liquid nitrogen by her GP but they  删除换行1 were unresponsive. She had been diagnosed two years previously with stage B chronic  删除换行1 lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). She has received several courses of chlorambucil, fludarabine and cyclophosphamide to which she partially responded and is being considered for  删除换行1 alemtuzumab (Campath – antiCD52) biological therapy in the future.\nExamination\n\n【4】She has multiple hyperkeratotic flesh-coloured papules and nodules, mainly over the  删除换行1 dorsi of her fingers and hands 删除33：<u></u> The lesions are warty in nature and firm on  删除换行1 palpation. The surrounding skin is normal.\n\n【5】At the time of review in the dermatology clinic, blood counts were normal.\n\n【6】INVESTIGATIONS\n\n【7】删除3：<u>Figure 77.1</u>\n\n【8】Questions\n\n【9】• Why does she have multiple lesions on  删除换行1 her hands?\n\n【10】• What treatment options are possible  删除换行1 for her skin lesions?\nANSWER 77\n\n【11】This woman has been suffering from multiple viral warts on her hands for many years.\nThe warts result from an infection with human papilloma virus (HPV) in the cutaneous keratinocytes. HPV is specific to humans and is passed by direct skin contact and  删除换行1 through fomites. HPV infects the basal keratinocytes; when these infected cells leave  删除换行1 the basal layer they become highly differentiated, triggering viral genome replication.\nConsequently, when the keratinocytes reach the epithelial surface, viral particles are  删除换行1 released with the sloughed-off cells into the environment where they can survive for  删除换行1 many months.\nHPV infections are common in the general population but are more frequently found  删除换行1 in patients who are immunosuppressed, when warts are often multiple. CLL causes  删除换行1 down-regulation of immune surveillance and an increased susceptibility to all manner  删除换行1 of infections. In addition, chemotherapy depletes patients’ white cell populations rendering them more vulnerable to infections. These patients are unable to clear the HPV and  删除换行1 subsequently develop multiple recalcitrant warts.\nAlthough cutaneous warts are not harmful in themselves they can cause a considerable  删除换行1 amount of distress to patients both psychologically and socially. Patients frequently feel  删除换行1 embarrassed by their warts and can often feel stigmatized by others.\nMost treatments for HPV are locally destructive (cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen, salicylic acid, electrodessication, CO2 laser) and then the host’s immune cells ‘mop-up’ the  删除换行1 residual virus released; however, when the host’s immune system is suboptimal, locally  删除换行1 destructive treatments are frequently ineffective.\nAlthough not licensed to treat cutaneous warts, treatment options include immunotherapy with imiquimod 5% cream (daily with Elastoplast occlusion) or diphencyprone (DPC) 删除换行1 fortnightly. DPC is a highly sensitizing chemical – patients are rendered allergic to it by  删除换行1 painting a small amount on their forearm skin, then increasing percentages are applied  删除换行1 directly to the warts to recruit immune cells into the local tissue. Cure rates of 60 per cent  删除换行1 are reported in immunosuppressed patients after 6 months of treatment. This patient was  删除换行1 treated with DPC immunotherapy to good effect. Topical bleomycin has also been used  删除换行1 with some success to treat recalcitrant warts in this group of patients.\n\n【12】 KEY POINTS\n\n【13】• If a patient presents with multiple HPV warts, then consider immune deficiency.\n\n【14】• Warts will eventually resolve spontaneously in the majority of patients.\n• Management of warts includes local destructive modalities and immunotherapy to the skin.",

        "text": "【0】CASE 51: BLEEDING IN EARLY PREGNANCY\n\n【1】History\n\n【2】A 23-year-old woman is referred by her GP with vaginal bleeding. She noticed that there was  删除换行1 blood on the toilet paper 2 days ago, and following this she has had bright red spotting intermittently. She has no pain and there are no urinary or bowel symptoms.\n\n【3】Her last menstrual period started 9 weeks and 6 days ago and she has a regular 31-day  删除换行1 cycle. She had a positive home urine pregnancy test 3 weeks ago after she realized she had  删除换行1 missed a period and was feeling very tired. This is her first pregnancy. She had been using  删除换行1 condoms but with poor compliance, so the pregnancy was unplanned but she is now happy  删除换行1 about it.\n\n【4】She is generally well, only having been admitted to hospital once in the past for an appendectomy at the age of 17 years. She takes no medication, does not smoke and drinks minimal  删除换行1 alcohol. She denies any use of recreational drugs.\n\n【5】Examination\n\n【6】The woman is apyrexial. The blood pressure is 120/65 mmHg and heart rate 78/min. The  删除换行1 abdomen is soft and non-tender with no palpable uterus or other masses.\n\n【7】INVESTIGATIONS\n\n【8】Transvaginal ultrasound is shown in Fig. 51.1. The crown–rump length is 25 mm (equivalent  删除换行1 to around 9 weeks’ gestation) and the fetal heartbeat is seen.\n\n【9】Questions\n\n【10】• How would you interpret the ultrasound result?\n\n【11】• What further examination, investigations or management would you like to perform or request?\n\n【12】删除3：<u>Figure 51.1 Transvaginal ultrasound scan.</u>\n\n【13】ANSWER 51\n\n【14】The ultrasound scan shows a viable single intrauterine pregnancy. The crown–rump length  删除换行1 is compatible with the gestational age by menstrual dates, especially as the woman reports a  删除换行1 long menstrual cycle (3 days longer than normal, therefore gestational age would be 3 days  删除换行1 less than the ‘normal’). Where there is a significant discrepancy with menstrual and ultrasound gestational age estimation (e.g. more than 7 days), one should consider the possibility  删除换行1 of inaccurate reporting of the last menstrual period date, irregular cycles leading to inaccurate estimated ovulation date, or of a possible growth-retarded fetus which may be destined  删除换行1 to miscarry.\n\n【15】In this case, as the ultrasound is reassuring the diagnosis would be of a ‘threatened miscarriage’.\n\n【16】Figure  51.2 shows a three-dimensional image of the fetus, demonstrating the developing  删除换行1 limbs and the physiological midgut herniation which occur at this developmental stage.\n\n【17】Further management\n\n【18】A speculum examination should be performed. The possible findings may be:\n\n【19】• normal appearance\n\n【20】• cervical ectropion (often associated with postcoital bleeding)\n\n【21】• cervicitis (common with chlamydia)\n\n【22】• cervical polyp\n\n【23】• cervical malignancy (rare but should not be missed).\n\n【24】No further investigations are necessary at this stage – the amount of bleeding is unlikely to  删除换行1 have caused anaemia. Rhesus status is irrelevant as anti-D immunoglobulin is only indicated  删除换行1 in a rhesus negative woman where the bleeding occurs after 12 weeks’ gestation or where a  删除换行1 miscarriage has occurred.\n\n【25】Management in this case is simple reassurance. Available evidence suggests that the pregnancy is at less than 5 per cent risk of miscarriage if the fetal heartbeat is normal and the  删除换行1 bleeding resolves. There is no clear evidence for progesterone, bedrest or avoidance of sexual  删除换行1 intercourse with threatened miscarriage. Further assessment should be offered if the bleeding becomes heavier or recurs. Otherwise the woman’s next appointments are likely to be the  删除换行1 antenatal midwife booking visit and the 11–14-week ultrasound scan.\n\n【26】删除3：<u>Figure 51.2 Three-dimensional transvaginal ultrasound scan.Case 51: Bleeding in early pregnancy</u>\n\n【27】KEY POINTS\n\n【28】• Vaginal bleeding in pregnancy is associated with miscarriage in up to 50 per cent  删除换行1 of cases, but the risk is lower if the bleeding is light.\n\n【29】• After a fetal heartbeat has been visualized, the chance of subsequent first-trimester miscarriage is around 5 per cent.\n\n【30】• Threatened miscarriage is managed supportively with reassurance – administration of progesterone and other measures have not yet been proven beneficial.Section 4\n\n【31】GENERAL OBSTETRICS\n删除测试1：<u>Case 52: Pain in pregnancy\n\n【32】</u>",

        "text": "【0】CASE 20: MANAGING DELIRIUM\n\n【1】History\n\n【2】An 83-year-old woman was admitted to hospital with shortness of breath and fever. She was  删除换行1 diagnosed with a community-acquired pneumonia and was treated with intravenous antibiotics. Despite being lucid throughout the day, she became agitated and confused overnight.\nThe following morning, the patient’s mental state and cognition had returned to baseline.\nThe patient had no history of dementia or cognitive impairment. Her past history was significant for hypertension and a previous hip replacement. Her regular medications were ramipril \n\n【3】2.5 mg OD and paracetamol 1 g QDS PRN. She lived alone and was independent with all  删除换行1 activities of daily living. She did not drink alcohol and had never smoked.\n\n【4】Examination\n\n【5】The  patient was examined whilst she was confused. She  was alert and agitated. She  was  删除换行1 not  orientated to time or place but was orientated to person. Cardiovascular, respiratory,  删除换行1 abdominal and neurological examinations were unremarkable.\n\n【6】Results\n\n【7】Bloods: WCC 11.6 (neutrophils 8.1), Hb 102, MCV 83, Plt 344, Na 140, K 4.1, Creat 65, CRP 72\n\n【8】Questions\n\n【9】1. Which investigations should be considered to identify a cause for the patient’s transient confusion?\n\n【10】2. If the patient becomes confused and agitated again, which medications could be  删除换行1 prescribed to manage this?\n\n【11】ANSWERS\n\n【12】1. The patient has fluctuating confusion consistent with delirium. Infection is a common precipitant for delirium and, in this case, the patient has an underlying pneumonia. Where infection is suspected as a cause for delirium, blood tests should be  删除换行1 sent to identify possible raised inflammatory markers. Blood cultures should be  删除换行1 considered, particularly if the patient is febrile and investigations such as a sputum  删除换行1 culture, urine dip, stool sample for microscopy and culture if there is diarrhoea, and  删除换行1 a chest X-ray should be considered.\n\n【13】 Electrolyte abnormalities, particularly hyper- and hyponatraemia, hyper- and  删除换行1 hypoglycaemia, and hypercalcaemia, are common causes of confusion, and these  删除换行1 should therefore be checked. Hyper- and hypothyroidism can also lead to cognitive  删除换行1 impairment, and a thyroid stimulating hormone level should therefore be measured.\n\n【14】 If there is a history of preceding trauma such as a fall that resulted in a head  删除换行1 injury, or if the patient is taking anticoagulant medications, then a CT scan of the  删除换行1 head should be considered to exclude an intracranial bleed.\n\n【15】2. It is important to emphasise that non-pharmacological methods of managing delirium, such as nursing patients in a quiet, dimly lit environment with continuity of  删除换行1 care from staff, is always preferable. Where patients are at risk of harming themselves or others and de-escalation techniques have failed, pharmacological management should be commenced.\n\n【16】 Firstly, drugs that may exacerbate delirium, including psychoactive medications,  删除换行1 should need to be discontinued where possible. Secondly, drugs to treat agitation  删除换行1 may need to be prescribed. Administering a low dose, observing the effect and then  删除换行1 prescribing a further dose if needed is safer than starting with a higher dose.\n\n【17】 Antipsychotic medications, such as haloperidol and olanzapine, are usually  删除换行1 the first-line therapy, although they can prolong the QT interval, and a baseline \n\n【18】ECG should therefore be reviewed prior to prescribing these drugs. Adverse effects  删除换行1 of antipsychotic medications also include extra-pyramidal symptoms and they  删除换行1 should thus be avoided in patients with Parkinson’s disease or Lewy body dementia. Benzodiazepines are generally accepted as the second-line agent of choice to  删除换行1 manage delirium and are particularly recommended for the treatment of delirium  删除换行1 tremens.",

The fingers, hands, flexor surfaces of the arms, axilla and feet seem to be the worst  删除换行1 affected areas but there are also lesions around the umbilicus and on the face.\n\n【5】Questions\n\n【6】• What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【7】• What is the differential diagnosis of an itchy rash in a child?\n\n【8】• What is the treatment?\n\n【9】ANSWER 45\n\n【10】The most likely diagnosis is scabies. This is caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei and is highly  删除换行1 contagious. Intense itching is typical. However in children under 1 year, this may present as  删除换行1 irritability. A history of contact may be present. The classic features are burrows, papules,  删除换行1 vesicles and pustules. Thread-like, linear burrows, typically in the finger webs and wrists,  删除换行1 are pathognomonic but are often difficult to see. Definitive diagnosis involves removal of  删除换行1 the mite from the burrow and examination under the microscope, but this, too, is difficult.\nSecondary bacterial infection due to scratching is common. In infants, the rash usually  删除换行1 affects the palms, soles, axilla and scalp. In older children, lesions typically involve the web  删除换行1 space between the fingers, the flexor aspects of the wrist and arm, the axilla and the waistline.\nThe face is rarely involved in those over 5 years of age. Other areas of the body can also be  删除换行1 affected. Although there is a strong family history of atopy, Diamond has never had eczema  删除换行1 and it would be unusual for eczema to present for the first time at this age in this way.\n\n【11】Common causes of an itchy rash in a child are as follows:\n\n【12】• Eczema – very common, often involves face, elbow and knee flexures.\n\n【13】• Seborrhoeic dermatitis – affects infants, often in association with cradle cap.\n\n【14】• Scabies – itchy where mite has burrowed.\n\n【15】• Insect bites – affects uncovered areas such as arms and legs.\n\n【16】• Drug and contact allergies.\n\n【17】• Urticaria – idiopathic or secondary to allergens, consists of wheal (raised and white) 删除换行1 and flare (red).\n\n【18】• Fungal infections – e.g. tinea capitis or tinea pedis (athlete’s foot).\n\n【19】• Chickenpox.\n\n【20】Treatment consists of the application of scabicidal medication, e.g. permethrin. Family members and ‘kissing contacts’ should also be treated. Topical or oral antibiotics may also be  删除换行1 required to treat secondary bacterial infection. Oral antihistamines and topical steroids, e.g. 删除换行2 1 per cent hydrocortisone, may be needed to help treat the itching. All clothing, bed linen and  删除换行1 soft toys should be laundered to remove eggs and mites. It can take 4–6 weeks for the itching  删除换行1 to resolve. If lesions are still present at this time, persistent infection or reinfection should be  删除换行1 suspected and treatment may need repeating.\n\n【21】Key Points\n\n【22】• Scabies infestation causes severe itching.\n\n【23】• The classic features are linear burrows, papules, vesicles and pustules.\n\n【24】• The treatment of choice is permethrin.",

The pain is continuous and dull in  删除换行1 character. Over the past 10 years she has had previous episodes of loin pain that have  删除换行1 occurred on both sides and resolved spontaneously over a few days. She has never passed  删除换行1 any stones. She was noted to be mildly hypertensive during her three pregnancies. She  删除换行1 has no other significant medical history. Her father died of a subarachnoid haemorrhage,  删除换行1 aged 48 years. Her father’s brother has had a kidney transplant. She has no siblings. Her  删除换行1 three children, aged 17, 14 and 10 years, are well. She works as a teacher and neither  删除换行1 smokes nor drinks alcohol.\n\n【3】Examination\n\n【4】On examination she is afebrile. Her pulse is regular at 76/min, and her blood pressure is  删除换行1 135/105mmHg. Examination of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems is otherwise  删除换行1 unremarkable. On palpation of her abdomen, ballottable masses are palpable in each flank.\nThe right-sided mass is tender to palpation.

She has macroscopic haematuria, hypertension and impaired renal function. The palpable abdominal  删除换行1 masses in both flanks have the characteristic features of enlarged kidneys. They are ballottable and resonant to percussion because of overlying bowel. The other principal causes for  删除换行1 palpable kidneys are renal cell carcinoma and massive hydronephrosis. Rest is the best management for cyst bleeding. Gross haematuria rarely lasts for more than a week.\n\n【23】ADPKD is the most common inherited renal disease, occurring in approximately 1:600 to  删除换行1 1:1000 individuals. Although the name ‘ADPKD’ is derived from renal manifestations of cyst  删除换行1 growth leading to enlarged kidneys and renal failure, this is a systemic disorder manifested  删除换行1 by the presence of hepatic cysts, diverticular disease, inguinal hernias, mitral valve prolapse,  删除换行1 intracranial aneurysms and hypertension. Flank pain is the most common symptom and  删除换行1 may be caused by cyst rupture, cyst infection or renal calculi. Macroscopic haematuria due  删除换行1 to cyst haemorrhage occurs commonly and usually resolves spontaneously. Renal calculi  删除换行1 occur in approximately 20 per cent of ADPKD patients (most commonly uric acid stones).\nHypertension occurs early in the course of this disease, affecting 60% of patients with normal  删除换行1 renal function. Approximately 50% of ADPKD patients will develop end-stage renal failure.\n\n【24】Although it is not known if this patient’s father had renal disease, it is highly likely that he  删除换行1 had ADPKD and an associated ruptured berry aneurysm as the cause for his subarachnoid  删除换行1 haemorrhage. The patient’s uncle required a renal transplant. The pattern of inheritance in  删除换行1 this family is consistent with an autosomal dominant trait.\n\n【25】Ultrasound is the preferred initial screening technique as it is cheap, non-invasive and rapid.\nIt detects cysts as small as 0.5 cm. For a certain diagnosis, there should be at least three renal  删除换行1 cysts with at least one cyst in each kidney. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are more sensitive techniques for detecting smaller cysts. Ultrasound  删除换行1 in this patient shows the typical appearance of multiple cysts (black areas) surrounded by  删除换行1 thickened walls 删除33：<u></u>. She should be referred to a nephrologist for long-term followup of her renal failure, and plans should be made for renal replacement therapy. She needs to  删除换行1 have effective blood pressure control with diastolic pressure less than 85mmHg to retard the  删除换行1 progression of her renal failure. Clinical trials are starting of vasopressin receptor antagonists, which show promise at inhibiting cyst growth.\n\n【26】She should have MRI angiography to exclude an intracranial aneurysm. This is not advocated  删除换行1 for all ADPKD patients but is indicated for those patients with a positive family history of  删除换行1 aneurysm rupture. The patient’s children should have their blood pressure checked and later  删除换行1 be screened by ultrasound. By age 30 years, 90% of ADPKD patients will have cysts detectable  删除换行1 by ultrasound.\n\n【27】Ninety per cent of ADPKD patients have mutations in the ADPKD1 gene. This gene encodes  删除换行1 for the protein polycystin, which is a membrane glycoprotein that probably mediates cell–cell  删除换行1 or cell–matrix interactions. Most remaining patients have mutations in the ADPKD2 gene,  删除换行1 which codes for polycystin-2, which has structural homology to polycystin and to calcium  删除换行1 channels. ADPKD1 patients generally have an earlier age of onset of hypertension and development of renal failure as compared to ADPKD2 patients.Case 26: Loin Pain and Haematuria\n\n【28】KEY POINTS\n\n【29】•\t Patients with ADPKD are often asymptomatic.\n\n【30】•\t ADPKD patients may present with loin pain or haematuria.\n\n【31】•\t ADPKD is the commonest familial cause of renal failure.\n\n【32】•\t ADPKD is the most likely cause of bilateral renal masses.\n\n【33】•\t Family members who may have ADPKD should be advised to have their blood pressure measured and a renal ultrasound.\n\n【34】删除3：<u>Figure 26.1 Renal ultrasound demonstrating multiple cysts.</u>",

She complains of painful ulcerations on the digital pulp of her fingertips that heal with scars. She also notes areas of asymptomatic dilated blood vessels on her lips that she finds unsightly. On examination, there are pitted scars on the tips of the fingers with some associated atrophy 通用删除7(英):<u>( 26 )</u>.\n\n【4】i. Based on this patient’s clinical presentation, what is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【5】ii. What basic laboratory studies can be performed to confirm the diagnosis and what additional screening tests can be performed?\n\n【6】Answer 26\n\n【7】i. This patient is presenting with systemic sclerosis (SSc), also known as scleroderma and progressive systemic sclerosis, which is an autoimmune connective tissue disease that affects the skin, blood vessels and visceral organs. There are two major clinical subtypes of systemic sclerosis: limited and diffuse. In the limited subtype of systemic sclerosis, fibrotic changes in the skin are limited to the fingers, hands and face. Classic cutaneous features involving the hands include pitting edema of the digits, a taut shiny appearance of the skin and flexion contractures and ulcers. In the face, contractures can lead to a beaked nose and microstomia. Matted or squared off telangiectasias are other common skin findings, seen on the face, lips and palms of patients with limited SSc. CREST syndrome is a variant of limited SSc and is an acronym for the clinical features of this entity, which include c alcinosis, R aynaud’s phenomenon, e sophageal involvement, s clerodactyly and t elangiectasias. In this patient, the most likely diagnosis is limited SSc, given the involvement of the fingers and face.\n\n【8】Diffuse SSc occurs when the skin disease involves distal and proximal portions of the extremities, the trunk and the face. Internal organ involvement can be seen with both subtypes, but the diffuse variant is typically associated with visceral involvement within the first 5 years of disease onset and is associated with a worse prognosis. The most common organ systems involved in SSc are the gastrointestinal tract, lung, heart and kidneys.\n\n【9】The diagnosis of systemic sclerosis can be made based on the classification scheme of the American College of Rheumatology, which includes one major criterion: symmetric cutaneous sclerosis proximal to the metacarpophalangeal or metatarsophalangeal joints; or ≥2 minor criteria, which include: sclerodactyly, digital pitted scars or loss of substance of finger pads and bibasilar pulmonary fibrosis.\n\n【10】ii. The presence of antinuclear autoantibodies has been reported in 80%–98% of the SSc cases. Classically, the autoantibodies detected are anti-centromere and anti-topoisomerase I in up to 50%–60% of patients with SSc. Further diagnostic tests to appropriately define the stage of patients with systemic sclerosis include esophageal manometry and pH-metry, lung vital capacity and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide, intrarenal duplex Doppler sonography, echocardiography and skin plicometry.",

Clinical Orthopaedic Examination,  删除换行3 Churchill Livingstone, Edinburgh, UK, 2003. With  删除换行1 permission.)</u></u>\n\n【20】ANSWER 58\n\n【21】A limp is a common problem in childhood. It is important to be aware that it can be due to  删除换行1 an abnormality anywhere from the back to the foot.\n\n【22】Causes of a limp in a child are best considered according to age as follows:\n\n【23】• 0–3 Years\n\n【24】• Trauma, e.g. fracture (may be accidental or non-accidental)\n\n【25】• Infections, e.g. septic arthritis, osteomyelitis or discitis\n\n【26】• Malignancy\n\n【27】• Developmental dysplasia of the hip\n\n【28】• Neuromuscular disease, e.g. cerebral palsy\n\n【29】• 4–10 Years\n\n【30】• Trauma\n\n【31】• Transient synovitis (irritable hip)\n\n【32】• Infection – septic arthritis, osteomyelitis or discitis\n\n【33】• Perthe’s disease\n\n【34】• Juvenile idiopathic arthritis\n\n【35】• Malignancy, e.g. leukaemia\n\n【36】• Neuromuscular disease, e.g. cerebral palsy\n\n【37】• 10–18 Years\n\n【38】• Trauma\n\n【39】• Infection, e.g. septic arthritis, osteomyelitis or discitis\n\n【40】• Slipped upper femoral epiphysis\n\n【41】• Juvenile idiopathic arthritis\n\n【42】• Malignancy, e.g. osteogenic sarcoma\n\n【43】The diagnosis is a slipped upper femoral epiphysis (SUFE). SUFE is commoner in boys and in  删除换行1 obese individuals. Pain can be felt in the groin, hip or thigh or there may be referred pain in  删除换行1 the knee. Classically, the affected hip is flexed and the leg is externally rotated. A small slip  删除换行1 may be missed on the anteroposterior view, therefore a lateral or frog leg view of the hip is  删除换行1 also necessary. The lateral X-ray shows displacement of the proximal femoral epiphysis relative to the femoral neck. Approximately 25 per cent of patients will also have a contralateral  删除换行1 slip and the other hip must therefore be carefully assessed.\n\n【44】A minority of patients with SUFE have an underlying endocrinopathy or metabolic abnormality (hypothyroidism, hypogonadism, growth hormone abnormalities, panhypopituitarism or renal osteodystrophy) and if this is suspected, then the appropriate investigations  删除换行1 should be performed. Janis is short and overweight and has a family history of thyroid disease. A more detailed examination demonstrated that she had a small goitre. Thyroid function tests revealed a free T4 of 9.2 pmol/L 通用删除7(英):<u>(12–22)</u>, a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) of  删除换行1 64 mU/L (0.5–6.0) and thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies of 1342 IU/mL 通用删除7(英):<u>(0–34)</u>. These  删除换行1 results are compatible with a diagnosis of Hashimoto’s (autoimmune) thyroiditis, and she  删除换行1 should be started on thyroxine. Obese individuals should have investigations looking at the  删除换行1 causes (such as hypothyroidism) and consequences (such as type 2 diabetes) of obesity.\n\n【45】Janis should be admitted and told not to weight-bear. She should be referred urgently to the  删除换行1 orthopaedic surgeons. Although it would seem that the SUFE has been present for 4 months,  删除换行1 one can get an acute or chronic slip of the epiphysis that can lead to avascular necrosis of the  删除换行1 femoral head. Surgery is therefore urgent and consists of pinning the femoral head to the  删除换行1 femoral neck.\nCase 58: A girl with a limp\n\n【46】Key Points\n\n【47】• In SUFE, a lateral or frog leg view, as well as an anteroposterior view, of the hip is  删除换行1 necessary to avoid missing minor slips.\n\n【48】• Urgent treatment is necessary in SUFE to try to avoid the complication of avascular  删除换行1 necrosis of the femoral head.",

        "text": "【0】Question: 6.1 A 24-year-old woman was hospitalized for acute pelvic inflammatory disease, and was treated with intravenous cefoxitin and clindamycin. Three days after discharge from the hospital, she developed severe abdominal pain and diarrhea. Which of the following organisms is the most likely causative agent?\n\n【1】A. Bacillus anthracis\n\n【2】B. Bacillus cereus\n\n【3】C. Clostridium botulinum\n\n【4】D. Clostridium difficile\n\n【5】E. Clostridium tetani\n\n【6】Answer: 6.1 D. The use of broad-spectrum antibiotics such as ampicillin and clindamycin has been associated with pseudomembranous colitis. Antibiotic administration results in the proliferation of drug-resistant C. difficile that produces toxins A (a potent enterotoxin with cytotoxic activity) and B (a potent cytotoxin). This disease is most appropriately treated by discontinuing the offending antibiotic and instead administering oral doses of either metronidazole or vancomycin. The administration of antibiotics may also lead to a milder form of diarrhea, called antibiotic-associated diarrhea. This form is associated with C. difficile approximately 25% of the time.\n\n【7】Question: 6.2 Which laboratory test is the best method to confirm the diagnosis of the patient in Question 6.1?\n\n【8】A. Gas/liquid chromatography\n\n【9】B. Pseudomembranous visualization\n\n【10】C. Rapid fatty acid detection assays\n\n【11】D. Tissue culture toxin detection assay\n\n【12】Answer: 6.2 D. All of the above tests may be used as detection assays for C. difficile . However, only the tissue culture toxin detection assay is the gold standard laboratory test. This test involves a specific toxin-neutralizing antibody that detects toxin (toxins A and B) production in the stool using a tissue culture detection assay. Not all C. difficile strains produce toxins, and the toxin genes are not carried on plasmids or phages.\n\n【13】Question: 6.3 A hospitalized patient developed severe diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis within 5 days after antibiotic therapy was initiated. The severe diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis occurred as a result of which of the following?\n\n【14】A. Collagenase\n\n【15】B. Fibrinolysin\n\n【16】C. Hyaluronidase\n\n【17】D. Lecithinase\n\n【18】E. Mucinase\n\n【19】F. Toxins A and B\nAnswer: 6.3 F. Clostridium difficile produces 2 toxins, toxins A and B. Both toxins are present in stool samples. Toxin A is enterotoxic causing the severe diarrhea, whereas toxin B is cytotoxic leading to the destruction of enterocytes, resulting in pseudomembranous colitis. For additional information please refer to the discussions for questions 6.1 and 6.2.\n\n【20】MICROBIOLOGY PEARLS\n\n【21】 The most common cause of diarrhea in a patient who has been hospitalized for 3 or more days is C. difficile .\n\n【22】 The initial treatment for pseudomembranous colitis is metronidazole. Oral vancomycin is used for those who fail to respond to metronidazole.\n\n【23】 Detection of toxins in the stool is the method of choice for diagnosis of C. difficile colitis.",

        "text": "【0】Question: A 27-year-old man enters the emergency department in an agitated state. He complains of severe abdominal pain, but soon becomes paranoid and combative, requiring five-point restraint. His vital signs show elevated blood pressure and tachycardia. When a straight catheter is inserted, reddish urine flows into the Foley bag. The urine is negative for RBCs, and a toxicity screen result is negative. The doctor suspects a porphyria. Laboratory tests for urine porphobilinogen are positive. Which of the following enzyme deficiencies is most likely responsible for this patient’s disorder?\n\n【1】> (A) Aminolevulinate dehydratase\n\n【2】> (B) Aminolevulinate synthase\n\n【3】> (C) Ferrochelatase\n\n【4】> (D) Heme oxygenase\n\n【5】> (E) Porphobilinogen deaminase\n\n【6】> (F) Uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase\n\n【7】> (G) Uroporphyrinogen III cosynthase\n\n【8】 Answer: The correct answer is E. Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) and porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) are the two most common porphyrias seen clinically. AIP results from a defect in the enzyme porphobilinogen (PBG) deaminase, also called uroporphyrinogen (URO) I synthase. PBG deaminase is the third enzyme in the heme synthetic pathway, and its absence leads to an aberrant accumulation of aminolevulinate (ALA) and PBG. In contrast, PCT is a defect in the enzyme URO decarboxylase, the fifth step in the heme pathway, which causes an accumulation of URO but not ALA or PBG. In this case the patient presents with symptoms most consistent with AIP: neurovisceral symptoms (most commonly abdominal pain, muscle weakness, and psychiatric manifestations such as anxiety, paranoia, and depression) and high PBG levels in urine. In severe cases the PBG can cause the urine to appear the color of port wine.  \nAnswer A is incorrect. ALA dehydratase, the enzyme responsible for condensing ALA into PBG, is absent in ALA dehydratase porphyria. Whereas this porphyria clinically resembles AIP, deficiency of ALA dehydratase is extremely rare, making AIP a more likely diagnosis in this patient.  \nAnswer B is incorrect. ALA synthase deficiency is associated with X-linked sideroblastic anemia. ALA synthase is the first and rate-limiting step in heme synthesis.  \nAnswer C is incorrect. Ferrochelatase incorporates iron into protoheme, the last step of heme biosynthesis. Deficiency of ferrochelatase results in erythropoietic porphyria, a disorder that usually begins with marked photosensitivity in childhood.  \nAnswer D is incorrect. Heme oxygenase catalyzes the oxidation of heme to biliverdin.  \nAnswer F is incorrect. PCT is seen frequently in the clinical setting. PCT results from a deficiency in URO decarboxylase. This deficiency may be inherited or acquired, the latter due to the inactivation of URO decarboxylase by iron, alcohol, estrogens, and infection with HCV or HIV. In contrast to AIP, patients with PCT present with photosensitivity, chronic, blistering lesions on sun-exposed skin, and an absence of neuropsychiatric signs.  \nAnswer G is incorrect. URO III cosynthase deficiency can result in congenital erythropoietic porphyria, and is associated with hemolytic anemia and photosensitive cutaneous lesions.",

        "text": "【0】CASE 42: ‘ALIEN IMPULSES’ AND RISK TO OTHERS\n\n【1】History\n\n【2】A 30-year-old shop assistant presents to the emergency department requesting that they  删除换行1 remove the microchip from her brain. She says that this chip was implanted into her brain  删除换行1 some weeks ago in order that aliens could control her mind.\n\n【3】She has previously been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and has had a number of  删除换行1 previous admissions to psychiatric hospitals, the majority of which have been involuntary  删除换行1 admissions. She has previously been treated with a number of different types of antipsychotic  删除换行1 medications, and this is currently olanzapine 20 mg once daily. Her last admission to hospital  删除换行1 was 6 months ago and since this time she has often missed her medication. She has no past  删除换行1 medical history of note.\n\n【4】There is no family history of mental illness. She is currently living with her parents who are  删除换行1 supportive of her. From the ages of 18 to 28 she smoked high-potency cannabis (‘skunk’) on  删除换行1 an almost daily basis, but following advice and support from her community mental health  删除换行1 team she has successfully cut down her use of cannabis to approximately once every month.\nShe has no other history of alcohol or illicit substance abuse. Although she has no previous  删除换行1 convictions she has previously assaulted her parents and ward nursing staff when psychotic.\n\n【5】Mental state examination\n\n【6】She presents as unkempt and is surprised that she is being asked about her previous psychiatric history rather than being referred to a neurosurgeon for removal of the microchip.\nDespite this it is possible to establish a good rapport. At several points during the interview  删除换行1 she stops speaking in mid-sentence and stares intently into one of the corners of the room  删除换行1 and begins whispering to herself.\n\n【7】She believes that a microchip has been implanted into her brain and that aliens are using this  删除换行1 to ‘put things into my mind’. She describes how the aliens put impulses into her mind which  删除换行1 she feels compelled to act upon. For 2 days the ‘alien impulses’ have concentrated on killing  删除换行1 her mother and she is concerned that she may act upon these. She denies any hallucinations  删除换行1 but during the interview appears to be responding to unseen auditory stimuli. She has little  删除换行1 insight and does not accept that a relapse of her mental illness could be responsible for her  删除换行1 current difficulties. There is no abnormality upon physical examination.\n\n【8】Questions\n\n【9】• What psychopathological term could be used to describe her belief that aliens are  删除换行1 putting impulses into her brain which she must act on?\n\n【10】• How would you assess the risk that this patient may pose to others?\n\n【11】ANSWER 42\n\n【12】Her belief that impulses are being put into her brain and are no longer under her control is  删除换行1 an example of passivity. The term passivity is used when the patient has the delusion that  删除换行1 some aspect that is normally under his or her own control is instead controlled by an external  删除换行1 agency. Examples of passivity phenomena are made impulses, made feelings and somatic passivity (a delusion that part of the body is under external control). Thought passivity refers to  删除换行1 the belief that thoughts are inserted, removed or blocked.\n\n【13】There are indications from this patient’s presentation and history that she may pose a risk to  删除换行1 others and in particular her mother. She is experiencing passivity phenomena that include  删除换行1 the made impulse to kill her mother. In addition to this she has a history of assaults upon  删除换行1 others (including her parents) when unwell. Her risk to others is also increased by her lack of  删除换行1 insight, poor compliance and history of cannabis abuse.\n\n【14】A comprehensive risk assessment is essential in this case. In order to do this it is important  删除换行1 to obtain relevant information from as many sources as possible. This could include a more  删除换行1 detailed history and mental state examination from the patient, discussion with an informant  删除换行1 (her parents would be especially helpful in this case) and previous psychiatric and medical  删除换行1 records and information from any professionals recently involved in her care (such as community psychiatric nurse, social worker or general practitioner). This information should  删除换行1 then be used to evaluate the presence/absence of relevant risk factors.\n\n【15】Other areas of risk that should be  删除换行1 explored include risk of harm to  删除换行1 self or suicide, risk of exploitation  删除换行1 and risk of neglect. A summary  删除换行1 judgement of risk should then be  删除换行1 made. This should include what the  删除换行1 risk is, who is at risk and the likelihood of this harm occurring. From  删除换行1 this should follow an appropriate  删除换行1 risk management plan. In this case  删除换行1 it would be appropriate to consider  删除换行1 admitting the patient to hospital.\nGiven the risk here, if this offer  删除换行1 is declined consider involuntary  删除换行1 admission using appropriate legislation, e.g. the Mental Health Act  删除换行1 通用删除7(英):<u>(1983)</u> in England.\n\n【16】Examples of relevant risk-increasing factors\n\n【17】• History of previous violence\n\n【18】• Substance abuse\n\n【19】• Psychotic illness\n\n【20】• Personality disorder\n\n【21】• Anger\n\n【22】• Lack of social support\n\n【23】• Relationship or employment problems\n\n【24】• Evidence of early maladjustment\n\n【25】• Non-compliance with treatment\n\n【26】• Use of/access to weapons\n\n【27】• Negative attitudes and violent fantasies\n\n【28】• Impulsivity\n\n【29】• Lack of insight\n\n【30】Key Points\n\n【31】• Passivity phenomena involve the patient believing that some aspect of his or her  删除换行1 body or mind is under the control of an external agency.\n\n【32】• Comprehensive risk assessment should involve information from several sources  删除换行1 and will lead on to appropriate risk management and the provision of appropriate  删除换行1 clinical care.\n\n【33】删除测试2：<u>Case 43: Feels like the room is changing shape\n\n【34】</u>",

        "text": "【0】CASE 92: FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION\nSayida, 21 years old, has recently arrived in the UK with her husband and 2-year-old daughter from their home country, Sierra Leone. The family left Sierra Leone because of war and  删除换行1 continuing political unrest and are seeking asylum in the UK. Sayida is 10 weeks pregnant  删除换行1 when she attends the antenatal clinic for her first booking appointment, accompanied by  删除换行1 her husband and a middle-aged female relative of her husband. The latter explains that she  删除换行1 has come along to act as chaperone and interpreter because Sayida speaks no English and  删除换行1 her husband very little. During initial assessment it transpires that a friend already living in  删除换行5 London has told Sayida about the African Well Woman Clinic (AWWC) and Sayida’s husband has telephoned for an appointment. Through the interpreter Sayida explains that she  删除换行1 had problems with her first pregnancy and during the birth, and her friend has told her that  删除换行1 the AWWC would be able to help her with this and ‘difficulties’ she has had since the birth  删除换行1 of her daughter.\n\n【1】Clinical examination by a female genital mutilation (FGM) public health specialist reveals  删除换行1 that Sayida has FGM III and is presenting with symptoms consistent with problems associated with urinary tract infection and the menstrual cycle.\n\n【2】Questions\n\n【3】• What is FGM?\n\n【4】• What are the laws in the UK regarding the practice of FGM?\n\n【5】• Should a competent adult be able to consent to the procedure?\n\n【6】• What is cultural relativism?\n\n【7】ANSWER 92\nAcross the globe the controversy of FGM has ignited arguments by human rights activists,  删除换行1 healthcare professionals and feminists for nearly half a century. In 2000 the World Health  删除换行5 Organisation (WHO) defined FGM as ‘all procedures which involve partial or total removal  删除换行1 of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs whether for cultural or any other non-therapeutic reasons’.\n WHO classification of FGM\n\n【8】• Type I: excision of the prepuce, with or without excision of part or all of the clitoris\n\n【9】• Type II: excision of the clitoris with partial or total excision of the labia minora\n\n【10】• Type III: excision of part or all of the external genitalia and stitching/narrowing of  删除换行1 the vaginal opening, also known as infibulation\n\n【11】• Type IV: unclassified. This includes pricking, piercing or incising of the clitoris  删除换行1 and/or labia, stretching of the clitoris and/or labia, cauterisation by burning of the  删除换行1 clitoris and surrounding tissue.\n\n【12】In many countries, FGM is accepted as the norm – an expected part of the customary practice  删除换行1 of many local communities. For many women FGM is a fact of life, a pain that must be borne  删除换行1 because they must conform to social expectation. People with little or no knowledge, skill or  删除换行1 training in female anatomy and surgical techniques perform FGM. It is usually performed  删除换行1 on girls between the ages of 4 and 13 years, but sometimes it is done in newborns or on  删除换行1 young women before marriage or pregnancy. It is often performed in unhygienic conditions  删除换行1 and without anaesthesia. Despite worldwide attempts to end the ancient tradition, every year  删除换行1 millions of women and girls are being ‘circumcised’. There are three main arguments against  删除换行1 the practice of FGM:\n\n【13】• It is a dangerous tradition with horrific medical consequences.\n\n【14】• It is primarily performed on girls who cannot consent to the procedure.\n\n【15】• It is a misogynistic practice carried out in patriarchal societies to repress female  删除换行1 sexuality.\n\n【16】Ethical issues\n\n【17】In a multicultural environment, it is important to respect others’ religious and cultural  删除换行1 beliefs and value systems. Many of the arguments centred on FGM are tied up in an intricate  删除换行1 web of ethical issues with the main conflict arising between cultural and individual rights.\nOpponents of FGM argue against the practice on the ethical basis that some human rights  删除换行1 are fundamental and supersede differences in cultural morality. The counterargument to this  删除换行1 is that different moral codes are applied by different cultures and that these should not be  删除换行1 criticised by people who do not have an intimate understanding of that culture. In bioethics  删除换行1 this argument is described as cultural relativism.\n\n【18】Relativism is a strain of ethical theory that holds that there are no absolute truths or morals. Mackie, a contemporary philosopher, cites that the proof of this is the existence of  删除换行1 diverse moral values, which have changed greatly over time and culture. Cultural relativism  删除换行1 argues that morals are merely socially approved habits, and the moral code that one culture  删除换行1 follows does not have to be the same as that of another culture. It holds that the morals of  删除换行1 other cultures should not be subjected to criticism from the subjective view of an outsider.\nIt  encourages diverse cultural expression and harmonious living in pluralistic societies  删除换行1 because it fosters an attitude of acceptance of other cultures.删除个例：<u>Faith, Values and Culture</u>\nA strong example of the ethical hypocrisy of criticism of FGM and of moral double standards  删除换行1 is reflected in the law concerning it. The UK and other countries have legislation making it a  删除换行1 crime to ‘excise, infibulate or otherwise mutilate the whole or any part of the labia majora or  删除换行1 labia minora or clitoris of another person’ 删除10：<u>(Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003, Section 1)</u>.\nYet in these same countries, genital cosmetic surgery in terms of piercings or labioplasty is  删除换行1 rarely criticised and has not resulted in prosecution.\n\n【19】Legal issues\n\n【20】In 1985 the Prohibition of Female Circumcision Act was introduced due to pressure from  删除换行1 global conventions to criminalise the practice amid fears that FGM was occurring in Britain  删除换行1 by African immigrants who had fled their own countries to escape from war and poverty.This Act made it a criminal offence to circumcise any girl or woman living in the UK no  删除换行1 matter what her nationality, religion or culture. In 2003 this Act was repealed by the Female  删除换行5 Genital Mutilation Act 2003, which was introduced to close a loophole in the law. It prevented \n\n【21】British inhabitants from taking their children away on ‘holidays’ to be circumcised. This is  删除换行1 an unusual step to take since crimes usually committed abroad are not liable to prosecution  删除换行1 under the British penal system.\nSection 6 of the 2003 Act clarifies that no distinction is made between FGM being performed  删除换行1 on minors or competent adults and prosecution can occur no matter in which country FGM  删除换行5 is performed. Note that the 2003 Act specifically forbids mutilation ‘required as a matter of  删除换行1 custom or ritual’, even if not performing it may have adverse mental health consequences.\nThe Act also extended the prison sentence from 5 years to 14 years, demonstrating once again  删除换行1 how serious a crime this is considered to be in the UK.\n\n【22】There are several defences to FGM:\n\n【23】No offence is committed by a registered medical practitioner who performs a surgical  删除换行1 operation necessary for a girl’s physical or mental health. Nor is an offence committed by  删除换行1 a registered midwife or a person undergoing a course of training with a view to becoming  删除换行1 a registered medical practitioner or registered midwife, but only if the operation is on a girl  删除换行1 who is in any stage of labour, or has just given birth, and is for purposes connected with  删除换行1 the labour or birth.\n\n【24】Crown Prosecution Service, Female Genital Mutilation Guidance\nDespite FGM being illegal since 1985, there have been no successful prosecutions. In a  删除换行1 recent landmark case, the Crown Prosecution Service charged a trainee obstetrician with  删除换行1 the crime of re-infibulation following the need for an episiotomy in a woman who had  删除换行1 undergone circumcision in Somalia at the age of 6. The jury cleared the doctor very quickly  删除换行1 and there was a public outcry that this attempted prosecution was detracting from the real  删除换行1 crime of circumcision and making midwives and obstetricians vulnerable. In comparison,  删除换行5 France has had over 100 successful prosecutions and has a zero tolerance policy on FGM, to  删除换行1 the extent that girls who are taken abroad during school term time and are at risk of being  删除换行1 mutilated are examined first, the parents are warned about the law and grave consequences  删除换行1 and then they are re-examined on their return to ensure they remain intact. The Serious \n\n【25】Crime Act 2015 删除10：<u>(by making changes to the 2003 Act)</u> now imposes a duty on healthcare professionals, teachers and social care workers, to notify the police when, in the course of their  删除换行1 work, they discover that an act of female genital mutilation appears to have been carried out  删除换行1 on a girl who is under 18. Such a notification would not breach any duty of confidence or 256 删除换行1 other restriction on the disclosure of information. A court can make a protection order to  删除换行1 protect a girl against the commission of FGM.\n\n【26】Child protection issues\nHealthcare professionals have an obligation to safeguard girls who are at risk of FGM and  删除换行1 must report cases to the child protection team. Refugees, asylum seekers and migrants to the  删除换行5 UK need to be given information about their health and the UK legal and child protection  删除换行1 issues regarding FGM. Sensitivity is an essential component of any interaction with patients  删除换行1 and their families. Wherever possible the aim must be to work in partnership with parents  删除换行1 and families to protect children through parents’ awareness of the harm caused to the child.\nA girl may be considered to be at risk if it is known that older girls in the family have been subjected to the procedure. Pre-pubescent girls aged 7–10 years are the main subjects, although  删除换行1 the practice has been reported among babies. If any agency is informed that a girl has been or  删除换行1 may be subjected to these practices, a referral must be made to social services in accordance  删除换行1 with child protection procedures. In planning any intervention it is important to consider  删除换行1 cultural factors because culture and cultural identity are frequently given as the reason that  删除换行5 FGM is performed, and any intervention is more likely to be successful if it involves workers  删除换行1 from, or with a detailed knowledge of, the community concerned.\n\n【27】Female genital mutilation is different from other child protection issues since it is a oneoff event of physical abuse (albeit one that may have grave permanent sexual, physical and  删除换行1 emotional consequences). A girl who has already been genitally mutilated should not usually  删除换行1 be registered on the child protection register, unless additional protection concerns exist,  删除换行1 although she should be offered counselling and medical help. Consideration must be given to  删除换行1 any other female siblings at risk.\n\n【28】Key Points\n\n【29】• In the UK, FGM is illegal. But despite this it continues to be practised due to the  删除换行1 growing number of refugees and asylum seekers from countries where FGM is  删除换行1 widespread.\n\n【30】• People who might perform FGM on their children should be educated sensitively  删除换行1 about the dangers of the practice and its illegality.\n\n【31】• In a multicultural environment it is important to respect others’ religious and cultural beliefs and value systems, but some human rights are considered universal.删除个例：<u>Faith, Values and Culture</u>",

Withdrawal of life support in a patient with a nonterminal illness\n\n【6】Answer: 3.1 D. Euthanasia, also called active mercy killing, is illegal in every US jurisdiction. It is permissible in The Netherlands. Euthanasia is distinguished from PAS as follows. In euthanasia, the physician directly causes the patient’s death; in cases of PAS, the physician provides a prescription to the patient to obtain a lethal dose of medication that the patient self-administers. Competent patients have the right to refuse all care, including life-sustaining care, even if such refusal will cause certain death and even if the illness is reversible. Finally, the principle of secondary effect refers to the permissible use of medications, such as morphine, in sufficient doses to treat suffering, even if those doses may secondarily hasten death.\n\n【7】Question: 3.2 Ethical principles about decisions on end-of-life care include all of the following except :\n\n【8】A.

Montana has case law allowing the practice. These are the only 4 states authorizing the practice in any way as of the time of publication. New Mexico has a case law that allows the practice, though it is currently being appealed.\n\n【20】KEY POINTS\n\n【21】 Patients have broadly recognized autonomy to refuse life sustaining or prolonging interventions, but access to legally permissible PAS is limited in the most US jurisdictions.\n\n【22】 The AMA opposes the practice of PAS.\n\n【23】 PAS is an issue that highlights the potential for conflict between ethics as articulated by organized medicine and legally permissible conduct.\n\n【24】 Physicians are never obligated to participate in PAS, even in jurisdictions in which the practice is legally permissible.\n\n【25】 Euthanasia, or active mercy killing, is illegal in all US jurisdictions. However, euthanasia must be distinguished from other interventions that are permissible and may secondarily cause death such as palliation and withdrawal of life-prolonging/sustaining care in cases of futility or competent patient choice.",

He is complaining of mild lightheadedness and feels the symptoms are getting worse. The pain is sharp and stabbing in nature.\nHe was previously fit and well. One day earlier he returned on a long haul flight from a  删除换行1 business trip to Asia. He denies any history of leg swelling.\n\n【3】Examination\n\n【4】Upon admission to hospital his oxygen saturation on air was 94 per cent and his respiratory rate was 20/minute. A chest radiograph failed to demonstrate any focal lesion.\nRoutine bloods were normal although D-dimer performed in the emergency department  删除换行1 was elevated.

After  删除换行1 24–72 hours, one third of patients with proven PE develop focal infiltrates that are  删除换行1 indistinguishable from an infectious pneumonia. Occasionally, there may be evidence of  删除换行5 Westermark sign, which is focal oligaemia (absence of blood vessel markings) beyond  删除换行1 the location of the pulmonary embolism and dilatation of those vessels proximally. A  删除换行5 rare late finding of pulmonary infarction is the Hampton hump, a triangular or rounded  删除换行1 pleural-based infiltrate with the apex pointed toward the hilum, frequently located adjacent to the diaphragm.\n\n【10】CTPA is the most common study used for detection of pulmonary embolism and has  删除换行1 become accepted both as the preferred primary diagnostic modality and as the standard  删除换行1 for making or excluding the diagnosis of PE. In the majority of patients, multi-detector \n\n【11】CT scans with intravenous contrast can resolve third-order pulmonary vessels.\n\n【12】It is important to note, however, that multi-detector CTPA carries a radiation dose and  删除换行1 can miss lesions in a patient with pleuritic chest pain due to multiple small emboli that  删除换行1 have lodged in distal vessels. In patients with a normal chest radiograph, nuclear scintigraphic ventilation–perfusion (V/Q) scanning of the lung is an alternative diagnostic  删除换行1 modality for detecting PE with a lower radiation dose.

This condition may occur at any age and can be either primary or secondary.\n\n【40】The primary form occurs de novo without a preexisting disease. It is isolated or associated with syndromes such as Albright hereditary osteodystrophy, fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, progressive osseous heteroplasia, and Gardner’s syndrome.\n\n【41】The secondary form represents 85% of cases and it develops in association with an underlying condition, such as inflammatory skin disease, tumors, trauma, malignancies, and scars. Acne vulgaris is the most common cause of secondary osteoma cutis.\n\n【42】The lesions of osteoma cutis may present as papules, plaques, nodules, or military (1–4 mm) lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【43】The main histopathologic feature of osteoma cutis is bone formation by the process of membranous ossification in subcutaneous tissue or the deep dermis. The bone thus forms a nodule of mature lamellar bone, containing osteoblasts, rarely osteoclasts, connective tissue, and mature fat cells. Occasionally marrow elements can be seen.\n\n【44】Treatment of osteoma cutis is mainly surgical excision of the lesion. Recurrences, especially in genetic forms, may occur 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【45】Calcinosis cutis, or cutaneous calcification , is the differential diagnosis for this patient. In contrast to osteoma cutis, calcinosis cutis is characterized by calcium salt deposits in the absence of osteoids. The calcified lesions are presented as palpable nodules that can vary in shape and size, depending on the calcinosis cutis subtype. They can be painful leading to functional impairment. There are five subtypes of calcinosis cutis described: dystrophic, metastatic, idiopathic, iatrogenic, and calciphylaxis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【46】The dystrophic type is associated with tissue damage and is the most frequent type. It is associated with various connective tissue diseases such as systemic sclerosis, dermatomyositis, mixed connective tissue disease, which induce tissue damage and creates a favorable environment for calcification.\n\n【47】The metastatic type is due to elevated calcium or phosphate levels.\n\n【48】The idiopathic type includes idiopathic calcified nodules of the scrotum, subepidermal calcified nodules, and tumoral calcinosis and has no underlying tissue damage or abnormal laboratory values.\n\n【49】Iatrogenic calcinosis is determined by the precipitation of calcium salts within the skin after administering calcium and phosphate-containing agents.\n\n【50】Calciphylaxis involves small and medium-size vessels with vascular calcification and skin necrosis, and it is associated with chronic renal failure and dialysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【51】The treatment is challenging and depends on the cause. Surgical treatment is chosen for small and localized lesions, whereas more generalized disease will require medical management 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【52】Another condition that must be considered is dermoid cyst that typically presents as a discrete, subcutaneous nodule. Dermoid cysts result from the sequestration of ectodermal tissue along embryonic fusion planes during development 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Dermoid cysts have a diameter between 1–4 cm. They are most commonly localized around the eyes, but they can also occur on the scalp. The cyst presents a thick wall lined with stratified squamous epithelium and may contain other typical cutaneous structures such as hair, sebaceous lobules, eccrine glands, apocrine glands, and smooth muscle. Treatment is surgical. Preoperative imaging studies may be required to exclude a connection to central nervous system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【53】Pilomatrixoma , also known as calcifying epithelioma of Malherbe , is a benign tumor of the hair follicle matrix that presents as a solitary skin-colored or bluish nodule. When syndromic (myotonic dystrophy, Turner syndrome, Gardner syndrome) pilomatrixoma can present with multiple lesions. Over 70% of the tumors arise on the head and neck areas, although they may develop on any hair-bearing surface. Histopathological features of pilomatrixoma include islands of epithelial cells that contain basaloid matrical cells, shadow, ghost, or enucleated cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm, foreign body giant cells, and calcifications. Unless the lesion is symptomatic, no treatment is required 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【54】Keloid scars are caused by an aberrant response of the healing process that follows a cutaneous injury or irritation that reaches the reticular dermis. Clinically, they appear as raised and firm scars, containing excessive collagen production; type III collagen is replaced by type I collagen, usually after four to eight weeks from the injury. Keloids extend beyond the original wound’s borders, do not usually regress spontaneously, and tend to recur after excision 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【55】Key Points\n\n【56】   Osteoma cutis refers to bone formation in the dermis and/or subcutis.\n   It can be primary, but more often is secondary.\n   Most common sites include the face (in female) and scalp (in male).\n   It is a benign tumor with an excellent prognosis.",

She was well until 8 months ago when she developed Raynaud’s phenomenon  删除换行1 and joint pains. The latter responded to a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID),  删除换行1 so she ‘got on with normal life’. Over the last few months she has noticed the skin over  删除换行1 her fingers becoming tighter. In recent weeks she has developed muscle weakness such  删除换行1 that she finds it difficult to climb stairs or get out of a chair unaided.\n\n【3】Examination\n\n【4】There is some skin tethering over the fingers, with reduction in the finger pulps.

The most likely diagnosis  删除换行1 is, therefore, mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD). Whether MCTD remains a truly distinct clinical entity is somewhat controversial and many patients may eventually develop  删除换行1 sufficient features to fulfil established diagnostic criteria of a particular autoimmune disease. The case presented here highlights the most common presenting features for MCTD:\n\n【19】• joint symptoms\n\n【20】• Raynaud’s phenomenon\n\n【21】• sclerodactyly\n\n【22】• proximal myopathy.\n\n【23】Other frequent problems include oesophageal dysmotility, serositis and lymphadenopathy.\n\n【24】Although respiratory involvement is common in MCTD, it is often asymptomatic. This  删除换行1 patient has fine bibasal crackles, which is suggestive of interstitial lung disease. She will  删除换行1 need a chest X-ray and possibly a high-resolution CT scan to identify interstitial changes,  删除换行1 as well as lung function studies to quantify any restrictive defect or reduced gas transfer  删除换行1 (diffusion capacity).\n\n【25】Management of MCTD involves directing therapy at specific abnormalities. The treatment  删除换行1 for each clinical feature in the combination is identical to that for a given presentation  删除换行1 in isolation; for example, vasodilators for Raynaud’s phenomenon, hydroxychloroquine  删除换行1 for arthralgia, and corticosteroids for myositis.

        "text": "【0】Question: A 19-year-old woman with no significant past medical history presents to her primary care physician for a sports physical. Her examination is notable for a brachial artery pressure of 160/110 mm Hg and a weak femoral pulse. Prompted by the weak pulse, her physician measures her blood pressure in the lower extremity and finds it to be 80/40 mm Hg. An x-ray film of the chest shows rib notching. This woman is presenting with a congenital condition that places her at high risk for bacterial endocarditis and which of the following other conditions?\n\n【1】> (A) Acute lymphocytic leukemia\n\n【2】> (B) Boot-shaped heart\n\n【3】> (C) Cerebral hemorrhage\n\n【4】> (D) Cor pulmonale\n\n【5】> (E) Eisenmenger syndrome\n\n【6】 Answer: The correct answer is C . A blood pressure in the upper extremity significantly greater than in the lower extremity, a weak to nonexistent femoral pulse, and rib notching on chest x-ray are all consistent with postductal coarctation of the aorta. This condition is associated with a high risk of bacterial endocarditis and cerebral hemorrhage. Postductal coarctation is caused by an abnormal constriction of the aorta distal to the ductus arteriosus during fetal development.  \nAnswer A is incorrect . Acute lymphocytic leukemia is associated with Down syndrome, which is also associated with an increased risk of an atrial septal defect. However, this is not associated with coarctation of the aorta.  \nAnswer B is incorrect . A boot-shaped heart refers to the cardiac silhouette produced in cases of isolated right ventricular hypertrophy, classically seen in tetralogy of Fallot. While aortic coarctation may theoretically lead to right ventricular hypertrophy, it will do so only after the left ventricle has hypertrophied and thus will not produce the boot-shaped silhouette.  \nAnswer D is incorrect . Cor pulmonale is defined as heart failure secondary to lung disease. If lung disease produces pulmonary hypertension, it will lead to right-sided failure. Since aortic coarctation is not lung disease, it cannot be associated with cor pulmonale.  \nAnswer E is incorrect . Eisenmenger syndrome is the secondary development of cyanosis in conditions that produce a left-to-right shunt, such as ventricular septal defects. The increased blood flow in the pulmonary circulation leads to pulmonary hypertension, which raises the pressure on the right side of the heart, eventually reversing the shunt. Because blood is now shunted right to left, avoiding the pulmonary circulation, cyanosis develops. Aortic coarctation does not produce a left-to-right shunt and thus does not lead to Eisenmenger syndrome.",

        "text": "【0】Case Files™ Neurology, Second Edition    \n\n【1】### CASE 52\n\n【2】A 43-year-old right-handed woman presents to the office with hearing loss, facial paralysis, and headache. Her history began 1 month ago with a sudden decrease in hearing from her right ear. One week prior to this visit, she began to notice weakness of the right face, which has now progressed to complete paralysis. Over the last 3 months she has had intermittent right occipital headache, and clumsiness and imbalance if she turns quickly. She denies any change in her voice or difficulty with swallowing or swallowing difficulty. Her past medical history is unremarkable. She is not on any medications except birth control pills. Her physical examination shows a 43-year-old woman that has an obvious right facial paralysis. Her pulse is 62 beats/min; blood pressure, 118/62 mmHg; and temperature, 36.7°C (98.6°F). The head and face have no lesions. Her voice is normal, but her speech is slightly distorted because of the facial paralysis. Her extraocular movements are normal. Her eye grounds do not show any papilledema. Her ears have normal tympanic membranes. The Weber tuning fork lateralizes to the left ear. Air conduction is louder than bone conduction in both ears. There is no neck lymphadenopathy or other masses. There are no cerebellar signs. The remaining physical examination, including the neurologic examination, is normal. An audiogram shows a mild sensorineural hearing loss in the right ear; the left ear has normal hearing. An auditory brainstem response (ABR) is abnormal for the right ear; it is normal for the left ear.\n\n【3】 What is the most likely neuroanatomic etiology and diagnosis?\n\n【4】 What is the next diagnostic step?\n\n【5】### ANSWERS TO CASE 52: Meningioma of the Acoustic Nerve\n\n【6】Summary : A 43-year-old woman has a history of headache, hearing loss, and facial paralysis.\n\n【7】• Neuroanatomic etiology and diagnosis : Cerebellopontine angle tumor, with the most common tumors being acoustic neuroma and meningioma\n\n【8】• Next diagnostic step : MRI with gadolinium\n\n【9】#### ANALYSIS\n\n【10】##### Objectives\n\n【11】1\\. Learn the most common tumors that occur in the cerebellopontine angle.\n\n【12】2\\. Learn the most common imaging features of these tumors.\n\n【13】3\\. Learn the available treatment options for these tumors.\n\n【14】##### Considerations\n\n【15】This 43-year-old woman has symptoms of hearing loss, facial paralysis, and headache. She also has symptoms of imbalance and disequilibrium. The most common cause of facial nerve paralysis is Bell palsy; however, this patient also has hearing loss, balance issues, and headache, which point to a central rather than peripheral disorder. Patients that present with the combination of hearing loss and facial paralysis demand evaluation by diagnostic imaging . This patient’s symptoms strongly suggest an abnormality in the cerebellopontine angle. Modern imaging techniques have revolutionized the evaluation of this area. MRI with contrast can readily differentiate the various pathologic processes that occur in this area .\n删除4：<u>Table 52–1 • MRI CHARACTERISTICS OF COMMON PATHOLOGY IN THE CEREBELLOPONTINE ANGLE</u>\n\n【16】### APPROACH TO: Cerebellopontine Angle Tumors\n\n【17】#### DEFINITIONS\n\n【18】ACOUSTIC NEUROMA : A benign tumor that rises from Schwann cells on the vestibular nerve also called vestibular schwannoma. This is the most common tumor found in the cerebellopontine angle.\n\n【19】AUDITORY BRAINSTEM RESPONSE (ABR) : An electrically evoked hearing test. In this test, electrodes are placed on each earlobe and on the forehead. A stimulus sound (either a click or tone burst) is delivered into the test ear at a specified loudness; an attached computer captures the electrical brain activity that results from this stimulus and filters out background noise.\n\n【20】BELL PALSY : Idiopathic facial weakness.\n\n【21】CEREBELLOPONTINE ANGLE : The anatomic space between the cerebellum, pons, and temporal bone. This space contains cranial nerves V through XI.\n\n【22】CONDUCTIVE HEARING LOSS : A form of hearing loss that results from a defect in the sound collecting mechanism of the ear. These structures include the ear canal, tympanic membrane, middle ear, and the ossicles.\n\n【23】EPIDERMOID TUMOR : A benign tumor composed of squamous epithelial elements thought to arise from congenital rests.\n\n【24】GLOMUS TUMOR : The common name for paraganglioma. This highly vascular tumor arises from neuroepithelial cells. These tumors are further named by the structures that they arise from: glomus tympanicum (middle ear), glomus jugulare (jugular vein), glomus vagale (vagus nerve), and carotid body tumor (carotid artery). A rule of 10% is associated with this tumor: approximately 10% of these tumors produce a catecholamine-like substance, approximately 10% of these tumors are bilateral, approximately 10% are familial, and approximately 10% are malignant (ie, potential to metastasize).\n\n【25】MENINGIOMA : Common benign extra-axial tumors of the coverings of the brain. The cell of origin is probably from arachnoid villi. Several histologic subtypes are described: syncytial, transitional, fibroblastic, angioblastic, and malignant.\n\n【26】SENSORINEURAL HEARING LOSS : A form of hearing loss that results from an abnormality in the cochlea or auditory nerve.\n\n【27】#### CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【28】##### Meningiomas\n\n【29】Meningiomas are usually benign tumors, of mesodermic origin, attached to the dura. They commonly are located along the sagittal sinus, over the cerebral convexities, and in the cerebellar-pontine angle. Grossly, they are gray, sharply demarcated, and firm. Microscopically, the cells are uniform with round or elongated nuclei, and a characteristic tendency to whorl around each other. Meningiomas tend to affect women more than men in the middle age. The typical clinical presentation is the slow onset of a neurologic deficit or a focal seizure; an unexpected finding on a brain imaging is also a common presentation. MRI usually reveals a dural-based mass with dense homogeneous contrast enhancement. Surgical therapy is optimal, and complete resection is curative. For lesions not amenable to surgery, local or stereotactic radiotherapy can ameliorate symptoms. Small asymptomatic lesions in older patients can be observed. Rarely, meningiomas can be more aggressive and have malignant potential; these tumors tend to have higher mitosis and cellular and nuclear atypia. Surgical therapy followed by radiotherapy should be used in these instances.\n\n【30】### APPROACH TO: Facial Paralysis\n\n【31】Facial paralysis is a relatively common disorder. In its most common presentation, facial paralysis occurs as a sudden sporadic cranial mononeuropathy. It is not associated with hearing loss; rather, it might be associated with hyperacusis. This form of facial paralysis, also called Bell palsy, is not associated with middle ear disease, parotid tumor, Lyme disease, or any other known cause of facial paralysis. Essentially, Bell palsy is a diagnosis of exclusion. Generally, a pointed history and detailed physical examination will eliminate most of the differential diagnosis. Likewise, the various causes of hearing loss can be eliminated by a careful physical examination. Disease processes, such as otitis media, cholesteatoma, and otosclerosis, can be eliminated by careful history and physical examination with tuning fork tests. However, to know the type and degree of hearing loss, an audiogram is necessary.\n\n【32】Although it requires patient cooperation, the audiogram will give the clinician a very accurate measure of the patient’s hearing level. The audiogram can distinguish between sensorineural and conductive hearing loss. Occasionally, patients have mixed hearing loss, or a combination of conductive and sensorineural losses in a single ear. Furthermore, the audiogram can give a clue regarding the presence of retrocochlear hearing loss or hearing loss caused by diseases proximal to the cochlea. Tests that might indicate retrocochlear pathology include speech discrimination, acoustic reflexes, and reflex decay.\n\n【33】#### DIAGNOSIS\n\n【34】Sensorineural hearing loss can be further evaluated by auditory brainstem response (ABR) . This test measures the electrical activity within the auditory pathway; and as such, this test helps to evaluate retrocochlear causes of hearing loss. The ABR has five waves that are numbered I through V, and these are correlated to major neural connections in the auditory pathway. These waves have expected morphologies and occur at predictable latencies. Waves that are absent or delayed are indicative of pathology at that point in the auditory pathway. The interwave latencies (such as I to III, III to V, or I to V) can be compared to the opposite side or to standard norms. Abnormalities on ABR need to be further evaluated by imaging studies.\n\n【35】MRI provides excellent definition of the structures within the posterior fossa. Gadolinium contrast allows additional differentiation of various pathologies. Additionally, newer technology, such as fat suppression and diffusion-weighted imaging can help to identify pathology 删除33：<u></u>. The MRI appearances of the most common tumors in the posterior fossa are indicated in Table 52–1 .\n\n【36】删除3：<u>Figure 52–1 . Post-gadolinium T1 MRI with fat suppression. Cerebellopontine angle meningioma. 删除10：<u>(Reproduced, with permission, from Lalwani A . Current Diagnosis and Treatment in Otolaryngology: Head & Neck Surgery, 2nd ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Publishers, 2008:154 .)</u></u>\n\n【37】Although MRI with gadolinium contrast gives excellent resolution for brain, nerve and soft tissues, CT scanning is necessary for bony imaging. Often, both imaging modalities are combined to understand the full extent of the disease process within the skull base.\n\n【38】#### TREATMENT\n\n【39】A treatment plan must be created once a cerebellopontine angle tumor is diagnosed. Many factors must be considered when approaching these tumors. The patient’s age, overall health status, tumor size and location, degree of hearing loss, and other neurologic signs should be taken into account. The various available treatment options must be discussed with the patient; the final decision of treatment course must be decided between the patient and the physician.\n\n【40】At least three options should be considered in managing tumors in the posterior fossa: observation and serial imaging, stereotactic radiosurgery, or conventional surgery . Some of these options might be unavailable or unwise for certain tumor types or tumor size. Clearly, the patient that has a large tumor that is producing brainstem compression or obstructive hydrocephalus should not be observed over time and serially imaged. These findings demand immediate attention.\n\n【41】Surgery can provide several benefits to the patient. Removal of tumor allows for final pathologic diagnosis, might correct neurologic deficits, and might prevent further complications caused by continued tumor growth. These benefits can come at a price of new neurologic deficits, meningitis, infection, stroke, or even death. The patient’s underlying health status must be considered because these surgical procedures are often lengthy. Patients with low overall health status might not tolerate such a procedure.\n\n【42】A relatively new (although more than 20 years experience) type of therapy involves the use of directed, focus radiation beam to the tumor . Several different proprietary devices have been developed to destroy or at least prevent growth of these types of tumors. The experience with stereotactic radiotherapy is probably greatest with acoustic neuroma , because that tumor is the most common mass found in the cerebellopontine angle . Stereotactic radiotherapy has been found to be very effective at managing small-to-medium-sized tumors (up to 3 cm). In these tumors, the complication rate for stereotactic radiotherapy is at least as low as that from conventional surgery; and with this type of therapy, a long hospital stay or recovery period is not required. The disadvantage with stereotactic radiotherapy is the potential for continued growth, and this growth does occur in a significant number of patients. Unfortunately, surgery following stereotactic radiotherapy is technically more difficult, and surgical results are not as successful as from surgery alone.\n\n【43】Stereotactic radiotherapy does have limitations. It is not useful for certain tumor types (meningiomas and epidermoids). Of course, stereotactic radiotherapy cannot provide pathologic specimens for study, and it should never be used when the pathologic diagnosis is in doubt.\n\n【44】####",

        "text": "【0】CASE 28\n\n【1】A 38-year-old G3P3 divorced executive presents to your clinic for contraceptive advice. She has been in a monogamous relationship with her boyfriend for sev-eral months. She denies any drug allergies. She occasionally drinks alcohol and smokes half a pack of cigarettes a day. She mentions that she used to take birth control pills without any problems. All three of her children were born via vaginal delivery without complication. She and her partner are free of sexually transmit-ted diseases (STDs) based on their recent checkups. She reports that she is tired of using over-the-counter contraceptives because they are inconvenient. She said that her life is very busy because of work. She fears any form of surgery and has not excluded having another child. Her laboratory workup is normal. Her physical examination is normal. She is looking for the “best contraceptive method\"for her situation.\n\n【2】What contraceptive options are available to this woman?\n\n【3】Which contraceptives are contraindicated for her?\n\n【4】Combination pills are the most commonly used contraceptive method. The combination pill suppresses ovulation through inhibition of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis， alters the cervical mucus， retards sperm entry， and discour-ages ovum implantation by creating an unfavorable endometrium. Combination oral contraceptives offer significant protection against ovarian cancer， endometrial cancer， iron-deficiency anemia from menstrual blood loss， pelvic inflammatory dis-ease (PID)， and fibrocystic breast disease. Women who take combination pills have a lower risk of functional ovarian cy CUS sts. The POP reduces cervical mucus and causes it to thicken. The mucus thickening prevents the sperm from reaching the egg and keeps the uterine lining from thickening， which prevents the fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus. The POP is ideal for breast-feeding mothers because it does not interfere with milk production as combination OCPs do. When taken as directed， the failure rate for the POP is 1% to 3%； the failure rate of the combina-tion pill is 1% to 2%. Typical use of OCPs has a failure rate of 8% to 10%.\n\n【5】Women over the age of 35 who smoke cigarettes and women with certain medi-cal conditions should not take the combined OCP. Table 28-2 lists the absolute\n\n| Table 28-2·CONTRAINDICATIONS TO COMBINED HORMONAL  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| CONTRACEPTION  |  |\n| Absolute Contraindications  | Relative Contraindications  |\n| Previous thromboembolic event  | Severe vascular headache (classic migraine，cluster)  |\n| Cerebral vascular disease  | Severe hypertension (if younger than 35-40 years and ingood medical control， can elect OCP)  |\n| Coronary occlusion  | Diabetes mellitus (prevention of pregnancy outweighs therisk of complicating vascular disease in a diabetic who isyounger than 35-40 years)  |\n| Impaired liver function  | Gallbladder disease (may exacerbate emergence of symp-toms when gallstones are present)  |\n| Known or suspected breast cancer  | Obstructive jaundice in pregnancy  |\n| Smokers (>15 cigarettes/day)olderthan 35 years  | Epilepsy (antiepileptic drugs may decrease effectiveness ofOCPs)  |\n| Congenital hyperlipidemia  | Morbid obesity  |When starting an O CP， ideally a patient should take the first pill on the first day of the start of menses. Women may also choose to start on the Sunday after the start of their menses for convenience. A quick-start method has also been pro-posed， in which patients start taking the pills as soon as they obtain the prescrip-tion (if pregnancy is unlikely)， which improves compliance. Both Sunday-start and quick-start methods require an additional backup method to be used for the first week. Postpartum， non-breast-feeding women should start the OCP during the fourth week after delivery. Breast-feeding women should start the minipill dur-ing the sixth week after delivery. OCPs can be started the day after an induced or spontaneous abortion. If a pill is missed， it should be taken as soon as possible and the next dose should be taken as usual. If two or more pills are missed， the patient should be directed to the package insert for instructions and additional backup contraception should be used for at least 7 days following resumption.A transdermal contraceptive patch (Ortho Evra and others) is a combined hormone patch containing norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol. The treatment regimen for each cycle is three consecutive 7-day patches followed by one patch-free week， so that withdrawal bleeding can occur. It can be started in a similar fashion to com-bined OCPs： on the first day of the menstrual cycle， the first Sunday after the men-strual cycle， or the day the prescription is filled. If the Sunday-start or quick-start methods are used， a backup method of contraception is needed for 7 days. The patch may be placed on the buttocks， lower abdomen， upper outer arm， and upper torso， 删除换行1 except for the breasts. If a patch becomes detached， it should be replaced as soon as possible. If the patch is detached for more than 24 hours， it should be replaced and a backup method of contraception used for the next 7 days. The patchs efficacy and side effects are comparable to that of combined OCPs， although there may be an increased risk of vascular thrombosis with use of the patch. Women who weigh more than 90 kg may be at increased risk of pregnancy with patch use.NuvaRing is a flexible， transparent ring about 5 cm in diameter that delivers etono-gestrel and ethinyl estradiol. A woman inserts the NuvaRing herself， wears it for 3 weeks， then removes and discards the device. After one ring-free week， during which withdrawal bleeding occurs， a new ring is inserted. It does not need to be fit-ted by a health professional， and does not need to be removed during intercourse. If a patient or her partner experience problems with the ring during intercourse， it may be removed， but should be replaced within 3 hours. If it is out for more than3 hours， ovulation may occur. The manufacturer recommends using backup birth control for the first 7 days after placement if not switching from another hormonal contraceptive.Rarely， NuvaRing can slip out of the vagina， and it is recommended to check the position of the ring before and after intercourse.NuvaRing may not be appropriate for women with conditions that increase likelihood of ring expulsion， such as vaginal stenosis， cervical prolapse， cystocele， or rectocele. The efficacy and most side effects of NuvaRing are similar to those of combined OCPs， although vaginitis， discomfort， and foreign body sensation are also commonly reported.Medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo-Provera， Depo-subQ Provera 104) is an injectable form of a progestin. Medroxyprogesterone acetate has a failure rate of only 0.3% with perfect use， or 3% with typical use. Each injection provides contra-ceptive protection for 13 weeks， but can last for up to 4 months. It is injected every3 months (90 days) into the gluteus or deltoid muscle. The first dose should be given within 5 days of the onset of menses， so that no backup contraception is needed. Its side effects include irregular menses， weight gain， and injection site reactions. Irregular bleeding and spotting is more significant during the first few months and then is followed by periods of amenorrhea. About half of women develop amenor-rhea after a year of medroxyprogesterone acetate use. There may be a prolonged period of time prior to return of fertility after discontinuing Depo-Provera， up to18 months in a small proportion of women.Contraceptive implants， Implanon and Nexplanon， are inserted subdermally in an in-office minor surgical procedure， and may be removed with another minor proce-dure. Placement should be timed during the menstrual cycle or during the hormone-free week ifusing a combined hormonal contraceptive method.The implant contains etonogestrel， the active metabolite of desogestrel， and is effective for 3 years. At the end of 3 years， when the device is removed， a new device may be placed in the same site. The failure rate is less than 1% for women who weigh less than 70 kg.IUDs are small， plastic， flexible devices that are inserted into the uterus through the cervix by a trained physician. Three IUDs are presently marketed in the United States： ParaGard T380A， which is a T-shaped plastic device partially covered by copper that is effective for 10 years， Mirena， which is also a T-shaped plastic device， but contains levonorgestrel (a progestin) released over a 5-year period， and Skyla， which is essentially a smaller version of Mirena that releases slightly less levonorg-estrel and lasts for 3 years. All are very effective； the copper-T IUD has a 0.6%to0.8% failure rate， the Mirena has a failure rate of 0.2%， and Sklya has a failure rate of 0.9%. An IUD alters the uterine and tubal fluids， particularly in the case of cop-per-bearing IUDs， inhibiting the transport of sperm through the cervical mucus and uterus. Progesterone-containing IUDs also thin the uterine lining. Timing of placement should occur during the menstrual cycle and more specifically during the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle for levonorgestrel-containing IUDs.\n\n【7】Manufacturer contraindications for IUD include current or suspected preg-nancy； current or recent acute PID or mucopurulent cervicitis； postpartum endo-metritis or infected abortion in the past 3 months； anatomically distorted uterine cavity， known or suspected uterine or cervical malignancy； unexplained uterine bleeding； and IUD already in place. Copper IUD is also contraindicated in Wilson disease. Levonorgestrel IUDs are also contraindicated in acute liver disease or liver tumor (benign or malignant)； breast cancer； and prior ectopic pregnancy. A history of STDs is not a contraindication to IUD placement， but if a woman has a known STD， it is recommended to delay insertion for 3 months following resolution of the infection. Levonorgestrel IUDs may actually reduce the risk of PID by thick-ening cervical mucus and thinning the endometrium， but caution should be used in patients who are at high risk for PID， and women with multiple sex partners should be counseled to use condoms in conjunction with IUD to reduce risk of contracting an infection.\n\n【8】Side effects include irregular bleeding patterns during the first few months of use， headache， nausea， hair loss， acne， depression， decreased libido， ovarian cysts， and mastalgia. Many patients will become amenorrheic or oligomenorrheic with a levonorgestrel IUD in place， so it can be used to treat patients with menorrhagia. The copper IUD may actually cause heavy， irregular bleeding. Women may also experience some short-term side effects such as cramping and dizziness at the time of insertion； bleeding， cramps， and backache may continue for a few days after the insertion. Complications include expulsion， perforation of the uterus， and ectopic pregnancy. Approximately， 5% of women expel their IUD within the first year.The patient should check that the strings are palpable once a month， and if she cannot find the strings， she should see a health-care provider. The absolute rate of ectopic pregnancy is reduced with the IUD because of its high contraceptive efficacy. How-ever， when accidental pregnancy does occur， there is increased likelihood ofectopic pregnancy. Adolescence and nulliparity are not contraindications.Tubal ligation seals a womans fallopian tubes so that an egg cannot travel to the uterus. Hysteroscopic tubal obstruction through the placement of steriliza-tion devices in the fallopian tubes is also available. Two types are Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved： the micro-insert device (Essure) and the polymer matrix system (Adiana). Vasectomy involves closing off a man’s vas deferens so that sperm will not be carried to the penis. Vasectomy is a minor surgical procedure， most often performed in a doctors office under local anesthesia. Hysteroscopic tubal obstruction may be performed with local anesthesia or oral analgesics alone. Tubal ligation is an operating room procedure performed under general anesthesia. Major complications， which are rare in female sterilization， include infection， hem-orrhage， and problems associated with the use of general anesthesia. The failure rate is less than 1%. Although there has been some success in reopening the fal-lopian tubes and the vas deferens， the success rate is low， and sterilization should be considered irreversible.All female patients of reproductive age should be made aware of postcoital contra-ception some of which are available over the counter for adolescent girls of 17 years and older. This knowledge does not increase the likelihood of high-risk behavior. The Yuzpe method consists of taking high-dose combined OCPs for emergency con-traception， and can decrease the risk of pregnancy by about 75%. This method can be used up to 5 days after unprotected intercourse but is most effective when used within 72 hours. Consider prescribing an antiemetic to be used 1 hour before each dose， as nausea and vomiting are common side effects. Progestin-only emergency contraception is available without a prescription. One or two oral doses of levo-norgestrel (Plan B) 0.75 mg， with 12 hours between doses， is more effective than the Yuzpe method， better-tolerated， and can be used up to 5 days after unprotected intercourse. Preven， a convenient emergency contraception kit， includes two doses of medication and a pregnancy test. A single dose of mifepristone(RU-486)，apro-gesterone antagonist， is the most effective emergency contraceptive and has few side effects. A selective progesterone-receptor modulator， known as ulipristal ace-tate (Ella)， is taken in a single dose up to 5 days after unprotected intercourse， and does require a prescription. Placing a copper-containing IUD within 5 days after unprotected sex is the most effective form of emergency contraception， and also provides another 10 years of birth control， but should be avoided in those at risk for STDs， ectopic pregnancy， or if long-term contraception is not desired.",

Lyme disease\n\n【2】B. Varicella zoster reactivation\n\n【3】C. Acoustic neuroma\n\n【4】D. Herpes simplex virus reactivation\n\n【5】E. Noncaseating granulomas\n\n【6】Answer: 35.1 D . By far the most common cause of acute facial weakness in an adult is Bell palsy. This disorder is caused by reactivation of herpes simplex virus. However, this is a diagnosis of exclusion as no accurate serologic tests have been discovered that confirm the diagnosis.\n\n【7】Question: 35.2 What is the key indicator of Ramsay Hunt syndrome?\n\n【8】A. Vesicles on an erythematous base found in the external ear\n\n【9】B. Noncaseating granulomas on lower lip biopsy\n\n【10】C. Circulating antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi\n\n【11】D. Uveitis and parotid gland swelling\n\n【12】E. Loss of taste on the ipsilateral tongue\n\n【13】Answer: 35.2 A . The pathognomonic feature of herpes zoster oticus (Ramsay Hunt syndrome) is a vesicular eruption on an erythematous base in an area of facial nerve sensory distribution (external ear). This disorder is caused by reactivation of varicella-zoster virus and is treated with antiviral medications and steroids. Inadequately treated zoster infections can lead to poor recovery of facial function and postherpetic neuralgia.\n\n【14】Question: 35.3 A 69-year-old man complains of right facial weakness. A close examination of his facial movements indicates loss of the nasolabial fold and inability to raise the upper lip on that side. His blink, forehead, and lower lip movement are normal. What is the most likely cause of his facial paralysis?\n\n【15】A. Bell palsy\n\n【16】B. Herpes zoster oticus\n\n【17】C. Malignant parotid gland tumor\n\n【18】D. Acoustic neuroma\n\n【19】E. Lyme disease\nAnswer: 35.3 C . Incomplete facial nerve palsy or involvement of an isolated facial nerve branch(s) is caused by malignancy until proven otherwise. Bell palsy, herpes zoster oticus, and Lyme disease affect the entire nerve. Acoustic neuromas can cause facial paralysis when they are very large, but this is very rarely seen in the modern area. Their location in the cerebellopontine angle would produce whole face weakness, and not an isolated branch weakness as described.\n\n【20】CLINICAL PEARLS\n\n【21】 Bell palsy is the most common cause of acute, unilateral facial weakness in adults.\n\n【22】 The diagnosis of Bell palsy is a diagnosis of exclusion.\n\n【23】 Facial paralysis with vesicles on an area of facial nerve sensation is pathognomonic for herpes zoster oticus (Ramsay Hunt syndrome).\n\n【24】 An isolated facial nerve branch weakness is a sign of malignant tumor involving the facial nerve until proven otherwise.\n\n【25】 Patients with facial paralysis or paresis should be given instructions regarding eye care and moisturization to avoid exposure keratopathy.\n\n【26】 Steroid and antiviral medications should be given to patients with either Bell palsy or Ramsay Hunt syndrome.\n\n【27】#",

He is currently intubated and ventilated, and requires haemofiltration. He will likely  删除换行1 require a prolonged hospital admission.\n\n【3】The intensive care consultant asks you to ‘take care of his nutrition’.\n\n【4】Questions\n\n【5】1. What are the causes of nutritional disturbance?\n\n【6】2. How can nutrition be assessed?\n\n【7】3. What are the options for optimising nutrition? Name some complications.\n\n【8】DISCUSSION\n\n【9】Nutrition is an important part of every patient’s care and should be optimised with the help  删除换行1 of a dietician, in parallel with treating his or her underlying pathology. It should be assessed  删除换行1 soon after admission as it is estimated that around a quarter of hospital inpatients are inadequately nourished. This may be due to increased nutritional requirements (e.g. in sepsis or  删除换行1 post-operatively), nutritional losses (e.g. malabsorption, vomiting, diarrhoea) or reduced intake  删除换行1 (e.g. sedated patients).\n\n【10】Signs of malnutrition include a body mass index (BMI) under 20 kg/m2, dehydration, reduced  删除换行1 tricep skin fold (fat) and indices such as reduced mid-arm circumference (lean muscle) or  删除换行1 grip strength. Low serum albumin is sometimes quoted as a marker of malnutrition, but this  删除换行1 is not an accurate marker in the early stages as it has a long half-life and may be affected by  删除换行1 other factors including stress.\n\n【11】The body’s predominant sources of energy are fat (approximately 9.3 kcal/g of energy),  删除换行1 glucose (4.1 kcal/g) and protein (4.1 kcal/g). The recommended daily intake of protein is  删除换行1 around 1 g/kg; nitrogen 0.15 g/kg; calories 30 kcal/kg/day. A patient’s basal energy expenditure is doubled in head injuries and burns. The major nutrient of the small bowel is amino  删除换行1 acid glutamine, which improves the intestinal barrier thereby reducing microbe entry. The  删除换行1 fatty acid butyrate is the major source of energy for cells of the large bowel (colonocytes).\n\n【12】There are two options for nutrition, namely enteral (through the gut) and parenteral (intravenous). Enteral feeding can be administered by different routes including oral, nasogastric (NG) 删除换行1 tube, nasojejunal (NJ) tube and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG)/jejunostomy  删除换行1 (PEJ). Enteral nutrition is generally preferred to parenteral nutrition as it keeps the gut barrier healthy, reduces bacterial translocation and has less electrolyte and glucose disturbances.\nFeeding through the mouth is the ideal scenario as it is safe and provides adequate nutrition.\nBefore abandoning oral intake, patients should be tested on semi-solid or puree diets and  删除换行1 reassessed for risk of aspiration (e.g. in stroke).\n\n【13】When comparing NG and NJ tube feeding, NG tubes are advantageous in terms of being  删除换行1 larger in diameter and less likely to block, whereas NJ tubes are better if a patient is at risk  删除换行1 of lung aspiration as they bypass the stomach. NJ tubes are also used in pancreatitis as they  删除换行1 bypass the duodenum and pancreatic duct, which reduces pancreatic enzyme release that  删除换行1 would have exacerbated pancreatic inflammation. NG/NJ feeds should be built up gradually,  删除换行1 and if the patient experiences diarrhoea or distention, the feed can be slowed down. Patients  删除换行1 on a feed should undergo initially daily blood tests for re-feeding syndrome, which causes  删除换行1 deficiencies in potassium, phosphate and magnesium.\n\n【14】Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is composed of lipids (30% of calories), protein (20% of  删除换行1 calories) and carbohydrates (50% of calories in the form of dextrose), as well as water, electrolytes, vitamins and minerals. TPN is indicated in patients who have inadequate gastrointestinal absorption (short bowel syndrome), or where bowel rest is needed (e.g. gastrointestinal  删除换行1 fistula or bowel obstruction). The disadvantage of TPN compared to enteral nutrition is that  删除换行1 it is more expensive, contributes to gut atrophy if prolonged and exacerbates the acute phase  删除换行1 response. Other complications of TPN include intravenous line infection or insertion complication, re-feeding syndrome, fatty liver, electrolyte and glucose imbalance and acalculous  删除换行1 cholecystitis.\nCase 2: Nutrition\n\n【15】Key Points\n\n【16】• Nutrition should be optimised in all patients, in parallel with treating their underlying pathology. A dietician should be involved especially where critical care input  删除换行1 or prolonged inpatient stay is predicted.\n\n【17】• There are two types of nutrition, enteral and parenteral. If it is safe and provides  删除换行1 adequate nutrition, oral intake is the preferred option.\n\n【18】• NG/NJ/TPN feeding all have complications including re-feeding syndrome, which  删除换行1 can cause hypophosphatemia, hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia.删除9：<u>http://taylorandfrancis.com9</u>",

He had  删除换行1 a syringe and needle in his hand when he was found. The paramedics examined the patient  删除换行1 and found that he was unresponsive to voice and pain. His pupils were 1–2 mm bilaterally.\nHis heart rate was 50 bpm and his respiratory rate was 4 breaths per minute. No other positive findings were elicited on systemic examination.\n\n【3】The paramedics diagnosed opioid toxicity and administered naloxone. The patient regained  删除换行1 consciousness and was brought to hospital where he recovered well. His blood results were  删除换行1 sent for toxicological screening and were positive for both fentanyl and heroin. The patient  删除换行1 expressed an ongoing desire to abstain from intravenous drug use and was eventually admitted to an inpatient drug rehabilitation unit. He commenced treatment with buprenorphine  删除换行1 to support his gradual withdrawal from opioid use 删除33：<u></u>.\n\n【4】Drug dose (log scale)\n\n【5】Response to drug (analgesia, euphoria, respiratory depression)\n删除14：<u>D</u>删除14：<u>B</u>删除14：<u>A</u>删除14：<u>C</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 14.1 Dose-response curves.</u>\n\n【6】Questions\n\n【7】1. The  patient was treated with naloxone, and subsequently with buprenorphine.\nWhat is the mechanism of action of these two drugs?\n\n【8】2. This patient has been exposed to a number of drugs in the history relayed above,  删除换行1 including heroin, fentanyl, buprenorphine and naloxone. Can you suggest which of  删除换行1 these drugs are depicted in the dose-response curves A, B, C and D?\n\n【9】ANSWERS\n\n【10】1. Naloxone is a non-selective competitive µ-opioid receptor antagonist that can be  删除换行1 administered by intravenous, intramuscular or nasal routes to treat opioid overdoses. Naloxone competitively binds to the µ-opioid receptor, thus preventing  删除换行1 both endogenous and exogenous opioids from binding and exerting their effects.\nNaloxone is rapidly distributed and metabolised and thus has a rapid duration of  删除换行1 effect. Patients with significant opioid toxicity may require multiple doses of naloxone, or even a continuous intravenous infusion to prevent respiratory depression.\n\n【11】 Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the µ-opioid receptor that is prescribed to  删除换行1 reduce dependence on opioids, such as heroin. The drug has a strong affinity for  删除换行1 the µ-opioid receptor, competitively preventing other opioids from binding. Due to  删除换行1 its partial agonist activity, buprenorphine does not induce significant pleasurable  删除换行1 effects such as euphoria, in contrast with other opioids.\n\n【12】2. The dose-response curves show the potency and efficacy of the four drugs discussed: \n\n【13】heroin, fentanyl, buprenorphine and naloxone. Drugs A and B are similarly efficacious, both achieving a similar level of response to the drugs. Drug A is more potent  删除换行1 than Drug B however, meaning that smaller doses of Drug A are required to achieve  删除换行1 maximal response compared with Drug B. In  this scenario, Drug A  is fentanyl,  删除换行1 which is an extremely potent opioid that is commonly mixed with heroin, and small  删除换行1 quantities of this drug can cause fatal overdoses. Drug B is heroin.\n\n【14】 Drug C is the partial µ-opioid receptor agonist, Buprenorphine, which is considerably less efficacious compared with fentanyl and heroin.

His parents had no records of similar family history including allergy. A biopsy of the fully developed skin lesion showed the infiltration of predominantly histiocytic cells mixed with lymphocytes in the superficial to midreticular dermis. Most of the histiocytes were well-defined without mitosis that had pale cytoplasm and bland round to oval nuclei. The area of the papule also could be observed mild focal vacuolar degeneration at the dermoepidermal junction and a slightly spongiotic epidermis.\n\n【13】Diagnosis\n---------\n\n【14】Benign cephalic histiocytosis\n\n【15】Discussion\n----------\n\n【16】Belonging to the family of non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis, Benign cephalic histiocytosis (BCH) is an orphan disease that mainly affects infants or children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. In 2014 Aikaterini Patsatsi et al. had reviewed 55 cases in Europe since the first case of BCH was reported in 1971 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Owing to its low incidence, the pathophysiology and etiology may still require further clarification.\n\n【17】The classical manifestations of BCH are asymptomatic macules and papules with size less than 1 cm in diameter usually restricted on head and neck, occasionally trunk or other parts of the body are involved 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Still, some reports described the extremities as the sole location of the BCH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The color of the round or oval lesions may range from tan to reddish yellow. The lesions may regress without any treatment. Normally, BCH don’t leave scar or hyperpigmentation.\n\n【18】Biopsy is a necessity to diagnose BCH. The lesions are abundant in well-defined histiocytic cells with low rates of mitosis from superficial to midreticular dermis. The nuclei of the cells are bland round to oval in shape, while the cytoplasm are vacuolated. Mixed inflammatory cells including lymphocytes and scattered eosinophils can be found as well. In most cases, the immunohistochemistry staining for CD 68 and factor XIIIa are positive, whereas CD1a and CD207 (langerin) that commonly used as the Langerhans cell markers are negative. Ultrastructural studies conducted by electron microscopy may find desmosome-like structures, coated vesicles, and comma-shaped bodies which may be characteristic of BCH. Immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy contribute more clues to diagnose BCH accurately.\n\n【19】Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is the most common histiocytic disorder that mainly affects mononuclear phagocyte system. This disease has the ability to influence any organ system which shows higher affinity in skeleton, skin, spleen, liver, and lung. The skin lesions of LCH also present varied manifestations, while a vast majority are seborrheic eczema. Biopsy shows the infiltration of numerous neoplastic cells with a coffee-bean nuclear grove and pale cytoplasm which are positive for CD207 (langerin) and CD1a in epidermis and dermis. When visualized by electron microscopy, rod-shaped inclusions with pentalaminar cytoplasm (Birbeck granules) are helpful to distinguish LCH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】Compared with BCH, juvenile xanthogranuloma (JXG) has a much higher incidence in the spectrum of non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Patients who suffered from JXG are usually infants (40–70%) and children. However, adults whose ages range from 20 to 30 may also have JXG without spontaneous regression. BCH and JXG share many similarities in clinical and histological features. Thus, there are points that BCH may be a variant of JXG. Nevertheless, the traits followed can be helpful to distinguish between BCH and JXG. For instance, JXG is not confined to neck and face and can appear over the entire body. In biopsy specimens, markedly xanthomized cells, ample eosinophils, and Touton-type giant cells may be clues to diagnose JXG rather than BCH. Of note, JXG can have extracutaneous involvement, particularly eye manifestations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】Molluscum contagiosum has been considered as the only member of the Molluscipoxvirus genus in the family Poxviridae that mainly affects children. Patients’ trunks, faces, and other anatomic sites except mucous membranes may present skin-colored to tan papules with the average diameters of 2–5 mm. The cheesy material can come out of the umbilicated top when squeezed. These lesions are usually transmitted by skin contact including scratch. Histologically, the typical results always show a crater-like inverted lobules with large, eosinophilic, intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies (molluscum bodies) and keratin fragments in prickle cell layer of the epidermis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】According to patient’s clinical features and biopsy results, the diagnosis of Benign cephalic histiocytosis was made. Due to the self-healing trait of BCH, we suggested the patient should be followed up without any treatment. Subsequently, his lesions spontaneously regressed after 3 months. In 2 years follow-up, there was no recurrence of similar lesions.\n\n【23】Key Points\n\n【24】   Benign cephalic histiocytosis is a rare non-Langerhans histiocytosis characterized by asymptomatic macules and papules restricted on head and neck.\n   BCH has trait of self-healing and should be followed up.",

        "text": "【0】CASE 18\n\n【1】A 10-year-old boy with chronic asthma is brought to a pediatrician for his 6-month checkup. He has complained of chronic headaches for the past 3 months， as well as increasing gastric upsets，which his family believes are caused by multiple food allergies. The patient has a severe allergy to peanuts， which limits the number of places he can go in public. Thus， he has been home schooled for a year and is doing well. A review of his history shows that he is a highly articulate， thoughtful child who appears to be at or above the educational level of his peers. The child does not agree to be interviewed separately from his mother， stating， \"l don't go anywhere without my mother.\" The two of them are almost never apart. Two years ago， the mother was hospitalized after a serious bout with lupus. She continues to struggle with her disease， and despite having a thriving career before her illness， she can do very little now. She is home all the time， dealing with her own recovery and the management of her illness. During her hospitalization， the patient was quite worried about her illness and even now believes that if he is not around to monitor her condition， she might get sick and require hospitalization again-or even worse.The mother has difficulty sleeping and is most comfortable on the living room couch. The patient no longer uses his own room but sleeps in a chair next to his mother to continue to keep an eye on her. He has very few friends and can be separated from his mother only briefly，and only if he is in the company of his brother or father. After a short period， he becomes anxious and upset and must be reunited with his mother.\n\n【2】What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【3】What is the prognosis for this disorder?\n\n【4】What treatments might be helpful in this disorder?\n\n【5】Summary： A 10-year-old boy presents with\n\n【6】● Extreme anxiety when not in the presence of his mother\n\n【7】No Ionger attending school due to a severe peanut allergy\n\n【8】● Being quite bright and cognitively on target\n\n【9】Anxiety symptoms beginning after the mother experienced a serious， life-threatening ilIness\n\n【10】●Believing separation from her will Iead to something terrible happening to her\n\n【11】● Several somatic complaints that have been difficult to diagnose\n\n【12】Most likely diagnosis： Separation anxiety disorder (a childhood disorder).\n\n【13】Prognosis： This condition is difficult to treat； without treatment， the patient is likely to develop depression and/or an anxiety disorder as an adult.\n\n【14】Helpful treatments： A multisystemic treatment approach is required. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can be helpful in the management of mood symptoms and anxiety. Relaxation techniques can help， along with a gradual sepa-ration program.

It can involve several specific theories and modalities of 删除换行1 treatment， but the essential feature is the involvement of various social systems essential to the life of a child. Examples of the systems involved include school， church， family， and peers.\n\n【26】SOMATIC SYMPTOMS： Vague or diffuse feelings of pain or discomfort for which it is difficult to pinpoint an etiology.\n\n【27】Clinical Presentation and Diagnosis\n\n【28】Separation anxiety disorder is more common in girls than boys. It is often pre-cipitated by the life-threatening disease of a parent—most typically the mother or primary caretaker. Patients become extremely anxious and worried when they are physically separated from the parent. They often worry that the parent will die if they are separated and thus are very difficult to console during these peri-ods. Their beliefs can be qu1Dite strong and are minimally amenable to reason or reassurance. These patients often report a number of difficult-to-diagnose somatic complaints themselves. See Table 18-1 for diagnostic criteria for sepa-ration anxiety disorder.\n\n【29】Children who have separation anxiety disorder have substantial risk of devel-oping either panic disorder as adults (12.6%)， panic with agoraphobia (18.6%)， or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) (26.2%). In addition， 32.6% will experi-ence an episode of major depression during young adulthood. It is thus impor-tant to assure that effective treatment occurs in patients with separation anxiety disorder as children. It is not just a\"phase that will pass.Patients with separation anxiety will often resist interventions that cause short-term discomfort， espe-cially efforts to gradually separate them from the parent， and push for parents to drop out of treatment. Parents should be educated regarding the long-term impact of this disorder and the need to complete treatment even under the pro-tests of their child.\n\n【30】Differential Diagnosis\n\n【31】Some degree of anxiety about separation from a parent is normal， and clinical judg-ment must be used to evaluate the severity of the anxiety and its impact on the functioning of the child. In GAD， the anxiety does not center exclusively on the issue of separation from a parent but is much more diffuse and occurs in many situ-ations. In major depression， patients typically have vegetative symptoms including insomnia and anorexia. Major depression often coexists with separation anxiety disorder and should be diagnosed concurrently if the criteria for the disorder are\n\n【32】Table18-1·DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR SEPARATION ANXIETY DISORDER\n\n【33】Developmentally inappropriate anxiety about separation from home or from the care taker to which an individual is attached. Duration of the illness must be at least 4 wk. Onset of the illness should be prior to 18 y of age. The disturbance should cause clinically significant impairment in important areas of functioning.\n\n【34】met. Panic disorders are rarely seen before the age of 18， and in that case the fear is of having another panic attack， not of separation.\n\n【35】ireatment\n\n【36】In childhood， separation anxiety disorder can be very difficult to treat and resis-tant to improvement. However， the best prognosis is achieved with a timely diag-nosis and rapid initiation of treatment， usually psychotherapeutic modalities directed toward the individual， family and school.\n\n【37】Treatment should always include psychotherapy， with exposure-based cognitive behavioral therapy having the most empirical support. These treatments should occur in conjunction with the development of a gradual plan to incrementally sepa-rate the patient from the parent， with a final goal of returning the patient to his or her earlier level of school and social functioning. Psychotherapy can be supported with the use of SSRIs to decrease the immediate anxiety the patient is feeling while in therapy. It is important to emphasize that medication without therapy is less likely to produce lasting improvement. There is some limited medical evidence suggesting that venlafaxine， tricyclic antidepressants， and buspirone may be effec-tive second-line treatments if SSRIs fail to be of benefit. Benzodiazepines have not shown efficacy in controlled trials in childhood anxiety disorders.\n\n【38】Family therapy can be necessary to identify and address anxiety triggers and to help the child develop skills to lessen anxiety symptoms (eg， relaxation techniques). School consultations can be helpful to aid in rapid， assertive reintroduction of the child into the school setting. A successful transition to gradually longer separations should result in generous praise for the child.\n删除16：<u>CASE CORRELATION\n删除25：<u>See also Case 20 (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) and Case 53 (Dependent Personality Disorder).</u>\n</u>",

TA may present in both adults and children. Hair styling behavior that induces traction results in mechanical damage to the hair follicle and dermal papilla. The initial presentation of patients afflicted with TA involves hair loss in the areas subjected to increased tension with retained hair along the frontotemporal area. TA may be diagnosed clinically or upon histological analysis. When addressed at the early onset of disease, TA may be reversible. However, chronic TA as evidenced by scarring and fibrosis is typically irreversible. Early diagnosis and treatment are imperative, as treatment is dependent upon the stage of disease. The histological findings of early-stage TA may display hair follicle loosening with evidence of inflammation and folliculitis. Additional clinical findings may include trichomalacia and increased number of telogen and catagen hairs. Preventive education involving the avoidance of behaviors increasing tension on the hair should accompany pharmacotherapy. Educational interventions may include counseling on the avoidance of hairstyles causing pain as well as promoting hairstyles that will reduce traction. Patients should be counseled on avoiding brushing, chemicals, or heat, as these practices can increase the risk of hair follicle damage. The goal of treatment in TA is to reduce inflammation and promote hair regrowth. The mainstay of treatment in the pediatric population is education and prevention. Adults in the early stages of TA may be treated with regimens including topical or injectable corticosteroids. Potential side effects include dyschromia and hypopigmentation. Topical minoxidil use may also be considered in the adult population. If pustules or folliculitis is evident, topical antibiotics such as topical or systemic antimicrobial therapy may be considered. Later stage TA management includes surgical options, hair transplantation, or camouflaging techniques. Investigational therapies include topical alpha-antagonist, platelet-rich plasma, and laser-assisted drug therapies.\n\n【11】Keywords\n\n【12】Traction alopecia Fringe sign Trichomalacia Tension hairstyles\n\n【13】A 47-year-old female complained of hair loss along the frontal scalp line.

TA occurs in individuals with hair practices that induce strain on the hair for long periods of time. Higher prevalence has been reported in ballerinas and Sikh Indian males 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. However, TA affects one-third of women of African American descent due to cultural hairstyle practices that induce mechanical damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】The consensus of recent literature determines that traction alopecia is caused by the hairstyle or practice rather than the hair type 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Hairstyles that can increase tension are ponytails, knots or buns, turban, braids, cornrows, extensions or weaves, twists, and dreadlocks. Hair practices such as chemical and thermal treatments can also increase the risk of TA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Strain from pulling can mechanically damage the hair follicle and dermal papilla. The early form of TA, beginning in childhood or upon early identification in adulthood, can be reversible 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Clinically, patients with TA will present with patches of hair loss in the areas subjected to increased tension along with retained hair in the frontotemporal area of the scalp, known as the “fringe sign” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Broken hairs and pustules may also be present and are the earliest clinical sign of TA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The histopathology in the early stages shows hair follicle loosening with inflammation and folliculitis. Tension on the hair follicle can pull the root sheath to the surface represented by white hair casts on the hair shaft 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Other findings may include trichomalacia and an increased number of telogen and catagen hairs.\n\n【25】If tension-creating practices are not modified, a chronic form of TA develops resulting in scarring hair loss which may be irreversible 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. An important identifier of late-stage TA is sclerosis and fibrosis. A common indication is the absence of hair with preserved follicular openings outlined in brown in the periphery of the affected patch on the scalp, corresponding to the pigmented basal cell layer of the follicular infundibulum that can be seen on histology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The histopathology of later stages shows diminished hair density and areas with absent hair follicles or loss of follicular openings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】Treatment\n---------\n\n【27】Management of traction alopecia is dependent upon the stage at diagnosis. Chronic stages are refractory to treatment; therefore, diagnosis at early stages is imperative. Preventative education can help children and adults from developing TA and should focus on avoidance of hairstyles causing pain as well as promoting hairstyles that will reduce traction such as looser braids and ponytails 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Patients should be counseled on avoiding brushing and refraining from chemicals or heat, as discontinuing these practices can decrease the risk of hair follicle damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. However, hair practices can be of cultural importance and care should be taken when discussing with patients. The Skin of Color Society recommends a “Compliment, Discuss, and Suggest” culturally sensitive communication model for approaching TA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】Early diagnosis can be imperative to reversing and preventing chronic TA. Treatment is focused on anti-inflammatory measures and hair regrowth. Topical minoxidil 5% once or twice daily is used in the early stages of TA, however, it has shown variable effectiveness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Combination treatment of steroids and minoxidil can maximize outcomes. Uwakwe et al. showed that combined use of topical minoxidil 5% and 3 intralesional triamcinolone acetonide injections 5 mg/mL at 6–8-week intervals showed halted progression of TA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Topical corticosteroids may be used if there is evidence of inflammation. Akintilo et al. reports the use of topical fluocinolone oil 0.01% for tighter curl patterns or topical fluocinonide 0.05% solution for looser curl patterns once or twice a day until improvement occurs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Oil-based solutions are preferred for curly hair to prevent breakage. Intralesional corticosteroids such as triamcinolone may be used when there is evidence of scaling, erythema, or tenderness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Dosing has not been well documented in the literature, however Akintilo et al. reports using 2.5 or 5.0 mg/cc for 3 cc total to the affected hairline once a month 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. A maximum dose should be limited to 20 mg per month to limit potential side effects of dyschromia and hypopigmentation. If pustules or folliculitis are evident, topical antibiotics such as topical clindamycin (1%) once daily can be used. For systemic treatment, oral antibiotics include the use of tetracyclines with an initial dose of 100 mg twice a day 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Reassessment should be done at each visit and consideration taken to decrease the dose to 20 mg twice a day after 3–4 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Primary management of TA in the pediatric population is hairstyle education and prevention. Minoxidil use for TA in the pediatric population has not been studied 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Consideration should be taken with steroid treatment in pediatric cases to prevent systemic side effects including growth delay.\n\n【29】Later stage TA management includes hair transplantation or camouflaging techniques. Surgical treatment should be considered if the patient has failed medical therapies. Hair transplantation techniques that have proven successful include punch grafting, micro-grafting and mini-grafting, and follicular unit transplantation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Patients often undergo multiple sessions to achieve desired outcomes.\n\n【30】Further investigation into the treatment of TA have focused on α1-adrenergic receptor agonist therapy. The arrector pili muscle expresses the α1-adrenergic receptor and the contraction is hypothesized to increase the amount of force needed to pull the hair from the follicle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. Topical phenylephrine was used to induce piloerection and resulted in decreased hair loss in 80% of the subjects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. Other modes of therapeutic consideration include platelet rich plasma (PRP) and laser-assisted drug therapies.\n\n【31】Key Points\n----------\n\n【32】   Traction alopecia is mechanical damage to the hair follicle from hairstyles and hair practices that place tension on the follicular unit.\n   Counseling and avoidance of specific hairstyles specifically in children are important first-line preventative measures for traction alopecia.\n   Topical medications remain the current recommended clinical management for early reversible traction alopecia.\n   Later stages of traction alopecia can be refractory to medical therapy but hair transplantation is a viable management option.\n   Promising new therapeutic considerations include the use of topical α1- adrenergic receptor agonists to increase the amount of force needed to pull or damage the hair.",

The most likely diagnosis for this infant is cardiomyopathy due to the child’s history, presenting symptoms, and initial imaging.\n\n【14】删除3：<u>Figure 97.1 Chest radiograph.</u>\n\n【15】Table 97.1 Basic metabolic profile.\n\n| Sodium | 130 mEq/L |\n| --- | --- |\n| Potassium | 7.8 mEq/L |\n| Chloride | 103 mEq/L |\n| Carbon dioxide | 11 mEq/L |\n| Blood urea nitrogen | 12 mg/dL |\n| Creatinine | 0.5 mg/dL |\n| Glucose | 88 mg/dL |\n\n【17】Table 97.2 Complete blood count.\n\n| White blood cell count | 12 000/mm 3 |\n| --- | --- |\n| Hemoglobin | 9.9 g/dL |\n| Hematocrit | 34.8% |\n| Platelet count | 203 000/mm 3 |\n| Neutrophils | 25% |\n| Eosinophils | 7% |\n| Monocytes | 18% |\n| Lymphocytes | 41% |\n| Bands | 2% |\n| Metamyelocytes | 7% |\n\n【19】Table 97.3 Arterial blood gas analysis.\n\n| pH | 6.6 |\n| --- | --- |\n| P CO 2 | 75 mmHg |\n| P a O 2 | 74 mmHg |\n| Bicarbonate | 8 mEq/L |\n| Base excess | –30 |\n| Lactate | 18 mmol/L |\n\n【21】Cardiomyopathy is defined as an abnormality of the ventricular myocardium that cannot be explained by congenital heart disease or abnormal loading conditions. Presentation can be highly variable, ranging from an incidental finding to cardiogenic shock. Cardiogenic shock is a medical emergency requiring prompt recognition, therapy, and hospitalization. Management of cardiomyopathy with cardiogenic shock involves medical therapies to treat the acutely decompensated heart failure, including potential mechanical support and/or heart transplantation. Subsequent therapy aims to reverse the chronic effects of ventricular remodeling.\n\n【22】There are two main morphologic types of pediatric cardiomyopathy: hypertrophic and dilated. Other less common types include restrictive, non‐compaction, mixed, arrhythmia‐induced, pacemaker induced, and post‐exposure to drugs or toxins, including chemotherapy. Morbidity and mortality are high: only about 20% of children with dilated cardiomyopathy regain normal function within 2 years, and 40% undergo transplantation or die. Infants with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have a 2‐year mortality rate of 30%. Cardiomyopathy may present at any age; in infants, the presentation is often similar to this case. Infants typically compensate for heart failure for some time before their condition requires emergent treatment.\n\n【23】### What additional diagnostic study is needed to confirm your suspected diagnoses?\n\n【24】Cultures and viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were obtained and empiric antibiotics are started. An echocardiogram is necessary based on the history, presentation, and chest radiograph findings. Pediatric cardiology performed a bedside echocardiogram that demonstrated a structurally normal heart with decreased biventricular function, ventricular hypertrophy, and moderate regurgitation across multiple valves. The ejection fraction was assessed to be severely decreased at 14%.\n\n【25】### What is the best way to support cardiac function and increase cardiac output in this infant?\n\n【26】In addition to increasing cardiac output, the immediate stabilization strategy also includes decreasing the workload of the heart. This will include intubation and mechanical ventilation, oxygen, and inotropic support aimed at increasing cardiac output, improving diastolic filling, and decreasing ventricular workload (i.e. afterload reduction). This infant was started on milrinone and epinephrine infusions. Milrinone is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that results in increased inotropy (improved contractility and stroke volume), lusitropy (improved diastolic relaxation and decreased diastolic pressure to allow for improved filling) and vasodilation (afterload reduction). Low‐dose epinephrine is inotropic, as well as a modest vasodilator.\n\n【27】### How would you determine if the therapy was effective?\n\n【28】Frequent invasive and non‐invasive hemodynamic monitoring is indicated. Normalizing heart rate, increased blood pressure and pulse pressure, and improvement in metabolic acidosis would be key markers of efficacy.\n\n【29】### What other therapies would be recommended at this time?\n\n【30】Beta‐blockade (if hemodynamically tolerated) may reduce outflow tract obstruction and allow the heart more time to fill and empty. Diuretics may be used if there is clinical volume overload. If medical therapy is insufficient, mechanical support may be needed. Options could include veno‐arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or a ventricular assist device, which is a pneumatically driven device that can be used in infants (e.g. Berlin heart).\n\n【31】### Which additional diagnostic studies and consults are needed?\n\n【32】A 12‐lead electrocardiogram (EKG) is indicated and multiple abnormalities may be present, including biventricular hypertrophy, arrhythmias, and first‐degree atrioventricular block. Infants with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy should be evaluated for inborn errors of metabolism or the infantile form of Pompe disease. In the case of Pompe disease, the 12‐lead EKG will show very large QRS voltages as well as a very short PR interval. This infant should have a genetics consultation. Additionally, this infant presented with severe liver dysfunction due to acute heart failure and cardiogenic shock; an abdominal ultrasound with Doppler flow would be recommended to ensure there was no thrombus from the low‐flow state resulting in liver dysfunction.\n增加换行1: Case Resolution\n---------------\n\n【33】This infant ultimately recovered her end‐organ function while being supported with a ventricular assist device while awaiting heart transplantation.",

The patient had a history of a cholecystectomy and tubal ligation. A lipoma was noted on a past physical exam, but it was not removed. She was in prison 5 years ago where she contracted tuberculosis, but failed to complete the course of antibiotics prescribed.\n\n【12】Physical Examination\n--------------------\n\n【13】Examination of the patient exhibited a prominent lipoma at her medial hypogastric region. The patient also presented with an ichthyotic lesion on her right forearm and acrochordons at her bilateral superior axilla and medial hypogastric regions. The right arm showed multiple, red papules, some of which were eroded.\n\n【14】Clinical Differential Diagnosis\n-------------------------------\n\n【15】   Syphilis\n   Sporotrichosis\n   Tularemia\n   Bartonellosis\n   Mycobacterium\n   Tuberulosis\n\n【16】Histopathology\n--------------\n\n【17】A shave biopsy was performed on the patient’s superior right arm 删除33：<u></u>.

Tuberculosis remains a world-wide disease with a third of the world population being infected. Most new infections are arising from Africa. HIV positive patients are at a 20× increased risk of contracting tuberculosis. The organism can be disseminated into all organs, but in the skin it often appears as “lupus vulgaris” or “scrofuloderma”. The organism grows intracellularly, and induces a granulomatous reaction.\n\n【30】While infectious processes can have a similar clinical appearance, microscopic examination using special stains as well as immunostains aid in the identification of a specific organisms. Although tissue cultures remain the traditional method of separating certain species based on metabolic features, newer molecular techniques are gaining acceptance. Clinically, the “B” symptoms are associated with tuberculosis; weight loss, night sweats, and fever.

This is a 66-year-old man with significant cardiopulmonary comorbidities andtypicalGERD-like symptoms that are partially relieved with an H2-blocker. Given this history of partial response， switching to a PPI is the best option at this time. Choice A is not a good answer because Nissen fundoplication may be risky for a patient with significant cardiopulmonary comorbidities； in addi-tion， operative treatment may not be needed as he has not yet received the best medical treatment. Esophageal physiology studies are appropriate to determine if GERD is the cause of his symptoms if he fails to respond to PPI treatment. Dietary recommendation should be provided for all patients but is not the best answer at this time. Reassurance is not an appropriate answer because the patients symptoms are not yet adequately addressed.\n14.2 B. This is a 51-year-old woman with cardiac risk factors and symptoms suggestive of GERD. The patient has been taking a PPI without symp-toms relief. Given her history of cardiac comorbidity (hypertension and hyperlipidemia)， evaluations for her atypical chest pain are indicated. She would likely benefit from cardiac stress test and other cardiac evaluations to rule out coronary artery disease. This patient has a hiatal hernia which occurs commonly and may not have any relevance to her GERD symptoms； therefore， specific work-up of this is not indicated at this time. CT of the abdomen and pelvis can be helpful to identify mass lesions or other structural abnormalities responsible for her symptoms， but without additional symp-toms such as obstructive symptoms or constitutional symptoms， this imaging study is not indicated at this time. Esophageal pH monitoring is a test that could likely help us determine if the cause of her symptoms is GERD-related， but tests to rule out cardiac disease should be done first. Patients with acha-lasia can present with GERD-like symptoms； however， cardiac causes need to be ruled out first.\n\n【31】14.3A. This 50-year-old man has a history of GERD and Barrett's esophagus without evidence of dysplasia. Patients with Barrett's esophagus should have treatment to optimally address their GERD； therefore， he should switched to a PPI which is a better pharmacologic choice than H2 antagonist treat-ment. Esophagectomy is an option for the management of patients with Barrett's esophagus containing severe dysplasia. Nissen fundoplication has not been proven to control Barretts esophagus progression better than PPI treatment.Misoprostol is helpful for gastric mucosal protection， especially in patients taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs， but this agent plays no role in preventing Barrett 's progression.\n\n【32】14.4删除38：<u>(</u> C. Antisecretory treatment and Nissen fundoplications are effective in reduc-ing progression of Barrett’s in GERD patients； however， antireflux surgery is not proven to be more effective than PPI treatment. Unwillingness to continue with PPI treatment， incomplete response to PPI treatment， and inability to tolerate or pay for PPI treatments are all reasonable indications to consider antireflux surgery options.\n14.5 A. Nissen fundoplication is contraindicated in a patient with gastroparesis， bloating， and GERD. Since the reflux of gastric contents in this situation is likely secondary to overdistension of the stomach produced by poor gas-tric motility， a fundoplication might reduce reflux symptoms but will cause worsening of bloating and distension. A displaced fundoplication causing symptoms is an indication for re-operation. A fundoplication procedure is an appropriate treatment option for a patient with Barrett’s changes with-out dysplasia or a patient with GERD and incomplete relief with medical treatment. Although not all patients with GERD are able to discontinue antisecretory therapy following fundoplication procedures， the procedure is not contraindicated for a patient who wishes to discontinue pharmacologic treatment.\n\n【33】14.66 B. A 47-year-old man with dysphagia to solids and liquids and GERD-like symptoms could have achalasia. Patients with achalasia often have undigested and fermented food remaining in their esophagus secondary to esophageal dysmotility and poor esophageal emptying. Fermented food with bacterial overgrowth in the esophagus can cause esophagitis and GERD-like symp-toms. The patient with breakthrough of GERD-like symptoms following initial response to low-dose PPI treatment does not raise a suspicion for alternative causes of the symptoms； therefore， manometric study would not likely contribute to the care. The patient with incomplete healing of his duo-denal ulcer after a course of H. pylori treatment needs biopsy to see if the infection has been eradicated.\n\n【34】CLINICALPEARLS\n A24-hour pHmonitoring study is the most objective indicator of GERD.\n\n【35】Apatient's response to PPI is one ofthe best clinical indicators of GERD.\n\n【36】Adenocarcinoma of the esophagus is a complication of long-standing GERD.\n\n【37】Gastroparesis or delayed gastric emptying can cause GERD-like symp-toms， but these symptoms are usually accompanied by bloating and abdominal distension.\n\n【38】The long-term efficacy of PPI and antireflux operations in reducing esophageal cancer develop in GERD patients appears to be equivalent.\n\n【39】Achalasia can produce GERD-like symptoms because undigested and fermented food in the esophagus can produce esophag itis.\n Endoscopic or operative antireflux procedures are indicated in patients with documented GERD whose symptoms are incompletely controlled with PPI， or in patients who do not wish to continue or are unable to tol-erate long-term PPItreatment.\n删除20：<u>Elmadhun N， Kent M.

This is clearly a moderate to severe flare of her eczema.\nThe severity of eczema can be ‘scored’ by various validated subjective (e.g. CDLQI – children’s dermatology life quality index) and objective scoring systems. Crudely, however,  删除换行1 the impact on sleep and school attendance as well as the clinical severity of her eczema  删除换行1 demonstrated in the photograph denotes severe eczema with significant functional  删除换行1 disruption.\n\n【29】There may be several factors contributing to the current flare. It is likely that there is an  删除换行1 element of secondary infection with Staphylococcus aureus or impetiginization of this  删除换行1 child’s eczema. The extensive yellow crusting of her excoriations, her tender lymphadenopathy, and the fact that her brother has impetigo, suggest colonization of the patient  删除换行1 and potentially other family members. Difficulty in adhering to a bathing regime is likely  删除换行1 to contribute. Other potential factors which worsen pruritus include iron deficiency. She  删除换行1 is also vitamin D deficient, presumably due to her dietary restriction (egg and fish are the  删除换行1 main dietary sources of vitamin D).\nIt is important to gain control of this child’s eczema rapidly. Swabs should be taken for  删除换行1 microbiology culture and sensitivity testing both from the patient and her immediate  删除换行1 family members. As there appear to be at least two members of the family affected by  删除换行5 Staphylococcus aureus it would be worthwhile considering Staphylococcus eradication  删除换行1 protocol for the entire family (i.e. antiseptic washes and antibacterial nasal ointment).\nThe patient might benefit from a 5–10-day course of antibiotic with good Staphylococcus 删除换行1 aureus coverage (first line: flucloxacillin; second line: erythromycin or co-amoxiclav).\nThe extensive use of a moderately potent topical corticosteroid ointment for 2–4 weeks  删除换行1 may be required before weaning back to weak preparations or calcineurin inhibitors as  删除换行1 maintenance therapy.\n\n【30】 KEY POINTS\n\n【31】• Atopic eczema is by definition eczema associated with a personal and/or family history  删除换行1 of atopy.\n\n【32】• Staphylococcus aureus may cause severe flare of eczema.\n\n【33】• Management of such a flare includes Staphylococcus aureus eradication as well as  删除换行1 appropriate treatment of the eczema.",

CT imaging shows lateral and third ventricle enlargement.\n\n【8】• Most likely diagnosis: Hydrocephalus\n\n【9】• Obstruction: Most likely the aqueduct of Sylvius leading to bilateral lateral ventricle and third ventricle enlargement.\n\n【10】### CLINICAL CORRELATION\n\n【11】Hydrocephalus is the accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain. This increased CSF can be due to increased production, disturbance in flow, or altered absorption. Symptoms depend on the age of the patient and the rapidity of development. In this case, the child has an acute onset (less than 1 week) leading to more dramatic symptoms. If the hydrocephalus developed slowly such as over months, the only symptoms may be a vague headache and memory problems. With acute hydrocephalus, the most common complaint is headache. Children often are lethargic or have insomnia; if these symptoms are significant, they can also lead to vomiting. This child also has mild sensitivity to light (photophobia) and neck stiffness (rigidity), which are indications of meningeal irritation. Acute meningitis or blood in the CSF can also cause these symptoms. A brain tumor is another possibility; imaging of the brain is important to rule out the condition. In this case, significant hydrocephalus is identified on the CT scan. Because the lateral ventricles and the third ventricle are dilated, the most likely location of the obstruction is at the aqueduct of Sylvius. The treatment is to relieve the CSF accumulation, which usually involves a shunt placement procedure; a ventriculoperitoneal route is most commonly used. Surgical relief of the obstruction may also be attempted.\n\n【12】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【13】#### Ventricular System of the Brain\n\n【14】### OBJECTIVES\n1\\. Be able to describe the location of the ventricles and circulation of CSF 删除换行5 2\\. Be able to identify the choroid plexus in the lateral, third and fourth ventricles, and the arachnoid granulations in the superior sagittal sinus.\n\n【15】### DEFINITIONS\n\n【16】CHOROID PLEXUS: A structure in the ventricles of the brain where cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is produced. The choroid plexus consists of modified ependymal cells.\n\n【17】ARACHNOID GRANULATIONS: Protrusions of arachnoid mater through the dura mater into the venous sinuses of the brain, allowing CSF to exit the subarachnoid space and return to the venous system. Most of the arachnoid granulations can be found in the superior sagittal sinuses.\n\n【18】### DISCUSSION\n\n【19】There are four ventricles in the brain. The lateral ventricles are located within the cerebral hemispheres. The third ventricle is located between the diencephalons, and the fourth ventricle is located between the brainstem and the cerebellum 删除33：<u></u>.\n\n【20】删除3：<u>Figure 54-1.

The Big Picture: Gross Anatomy. New York: McGraw-Hill Medical, 2011)</u></u></u>\n\n【21】The paired lateral ventricles are the largest in the ventricle system of the brain and are each composed of one body and three horns: the anterior or frontal horn extends into the frontal lobe, the posterior or occipital horn extends into the occipital lobe, and the lateral or temporal horn extends into the temporal lobe. The body of the lateral ventricle is the central portion and is found in the parietal lobe just posterior to the frontal horn. The inner surface of the lateral ventricles is covered by a thin epithelial membrane called the ependyma . In the central portion and temporal horns of the ventricle, the ependyma is folded into the cavity with capillaries to form the choroid plexus , which produces CSF. CSF produced in the lateral ventricles flows into the third ventricle through interventricular foramen of Monro.\n\n【22】The third ventricle is a narrow, slitlike space. The choroid plexus is found in the superior part of this ventricle close to the interventricular foramen. The cerebral aqueduct of Sylvius conducts CSF from the third ventricle to the fourth ventricle.\n\n【23】The fourth ventricle has a tentlike configuration. The rhomboid fossa of the brainstem forms the floor, and the superior and inferior medullary velum of the cerebellum form the roof of this ventricle. The choroid plexus is found in the inferior part of this ventricle. From the fourth ventricle, CSF flows into the subarachnoid space through the foramina of Magendie and Luschka.\n\n【24】After the CSF circulates into the subarachnoid space and surrounds the brain and spinal cord, it is drained into the venous sinuses via the arachnoid granulations located mostly in the superior sagittal sinus 删除33：<u></u>.\n\n【25】删除3：<u>Figure 54-2. Flowchart showing circulation of CSF in the subarachnoid space.</u>\n\n【26】Increasing production of CSF, decreasing the absorption of CSF, or blocking the flow of CSF will cause it to accumulate in the ventricles, leading to hydrocephalus.\n\n【27】###",

        "text": "【0】Question: A 64-year-old woman presents to the physician because of new onset postmenopausal bleeding. Ultrasonography reveals a small mass in the left adnexa, along with a thickened endometrial stripe. A biopsy of her left ovary reveals the presence of Call-Exner bodies. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【1】> (A) Endometrioid tumor\n\n【2】> (B) Granulosa cell tumor\n\n【3】> (C) Krukenberg tumor\n\n【4】> (D) Serous cystadenocarcinoma\n\n【5】> (E) Teratoma\n Answer: The correct answer is B. The classic histologic finding in a granulosa cell tumor of the ovary is the presence of Call-Exner bodies, which are follicles with granulosa cells haphazardly arranged around a space containing eosinophilic secretions. The clinical presentation also supports this diagnosis. About two-thirds of ovarian granulosa cell tumors occur in postmenopausal women (average age at menopause in the United States is 51 years). Granulosa cell tumors are usually estrogen-secreting, but occasionally produce androgens leading to virilization. Estrogen-secreting tumors in children and adolescents can cause precocious puberty. In adults they are often associated with endometrial hyperplasia, cystic breast disease, and endometrial carcinoma. Up to 15% of patients with estrogen-secreting tumors develop an endometrial carcinoma. Evidence of increased endometrial thickness (revealing hyperplasia or carcinoma) is found in this patient as a thickened endometrial stripe on ultrasonography. The endometrial stripe is an area of the endometrium with differing echogenicity, allowing the thickness to be measured. This increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma is due to the unopposed estrogen secretion by the tumor, which stimulates growth of the endometrium. This abnormal endometrial growth leads to subsequent sloughing off, resulting in abnormal vaginal bleeding, a common presentation of endometrial abnormalities.  \nAnswer A is incorrect. An endometrioid tumor, as the name suggests, histologically resembles endometrium. It does not have Call-Exner bodies on histologic examination, and because it does not secrete estrogen, it would not present with vaginal bleeding and a thickened endometrial stripe.  \nAnswer C is incorrect. Krukenberg tumors are tumors that are metastatic to the ovaries from the GI system, most commonly the stomach. The classic histologic finding is a mucinsecreting signet-ring cell, not a Call-Exner body.  \nAnswer D is incorrect. Call-Exner bodies would not be found in serous cystadenocarcinoma. Instead, one would expect to see a tumor lined with epithelium resembling that of the fallopian tube and psammoma bodies (concentric rings of calcification). These types of tumors are very common and account for >50% of ovarian carcinomas. Because they do not secrete estrogen, they do not classically present with vaginal bleeding and would not cause a thickened endometrial stripe.  \nAnswer E is incorrect. A teratoma contains tissue derived from at least two different embryonic layers. For example, thyroid tissue, neural tissue, muscle tissue, bone, and even teeth may be present. Immature teratomas are more aggressive and are always malignant, while mature teratomas are well differentiated and benign. One would not expect to see Call-Exner bodies or vaginal bleeding with a teratoma.",

It typically affects infants and toddlers, and causes systemic vasculitis. The most common pathologic findings include systemic vasculitis and a high incidence of inflammatory lesions affecting various organs, such as liver, kidney, lungs, and nervous system. More and more attentions had been paid to KD complicated with kidney injury in recent years. The involvement of the genitourinary tract in KD manifests itself clinically in various forms. The most common presentations are sterile pyuria and proteinuria; fewer patients have transient microscopic hematuria. Although they are rare, severe complications such as renovascular hypertension, hemolytic uremic syndrome, interstitial nephritis, and acute renal failure have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>.\n2.  2.\n    Histological findings included a normal glomerulus or mild expansion of the mesangial matrix; interstitial infiltration of lymphocytes, plasmocytes, and eosinophils; and a focus of tubular necrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. There are also a few literatures suggesting that KD may affect renal parenchyma. Renal scar formation was found about half a year after KD diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n3.  3.\n    In this case, when the patient was diagnosed with KD at first time, urine routine test indicated urinary protein (+), RBC 7.0/HP, WBC 11.03/HP. The second time he was diagnosed with KD, urine routine test showed that protein level was increased (+++), RBC 491.35/HP, and WBC 10.4/HP. Urologic ultrasonography revealed diffuse injury on both kidneys, but with normal Cr and BUN. RBC malformation rate was 70% indicating RBC coming from glomerular. After IVIG treatment, urine protein was regressed to (+), RBC was reduced to 26.75/HP, WBC was normal. In addition, urine β <sub>2 </sub> micro-globulin was slightly increased, which suggest impaired renal tubular function. The increased urine transferrin suggested impaired renal glomerular function, too. But, normal Cr and BUN implied there were no severe renal function damages. Furthermore, kidney ultrasound showed they were recovered to normal, and urine β <sub>2 </sub> micro-globulin was recovered, which suggested that the impaired renal tubular function may be transient and reversible. Further increased urinary transferrin suggested unrecovered glomerular function. Normal GRF but slow excretion indicated the injury was there for some time. This may be the reason to keep hematuria, and requires dynamic follow-up.\n4.  4.\n    To determine the causes of hematuria proteinuria whether by KD-related vasculitis or by other immune-related diseases prior to KD, we test ANCA and antinuclear antibody serial examinations, but we did not find abnormalities. His parents refused to give consent on further tests including immunodeficiency screening, abdominal CT, lipid, scleral ciliary body, and nephrodialysis.\n5.  5.\n    This was the first time for us to see KD children with both hematuria and proteinuria diagnosed in our center. With the improvement of the disease, the urine routine test results returned to normal at his first time KD, which was consistent with the literature reports. After the recurrence of KD, obvious hematuria and proteinuria were found in the acute phase, and the 24-h urine protein quantification reached the nephropathy standard. Although the urine routine was slightly improved at convalescence period at 2 months of illness, his conditions met the guideline standard for stopping all drugs. The urine routine was still abnormal. The long-term prognosis for this patient is unknown because we have not been given a chance to follow up with him.\n\n【26】Xue-mei Li",

Medical practitioners should suspect photosensitivity  删除换行1 if skin disease affects exposed skin sites – classically the face, hands and anterior chest.\nOn direct questioning, patients may report a worsening of their skin condition during the  删除换行1 summer or following a holiday abroad.\nThis patient was diagnosed with porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) which usually presents  删除换行1 between the 3rd to 5th decades. The condition is characterized by skin fragility leading  删除换行1 to blister formation following minor trauma. Initially, skin changes include tense vesicles/bullae and erosions on a background of normal-looking skin. However, these heal  删除换行1 to leave small atrophic scars and milia (inclusion cysts) as seen in this patient. Waxylooking plaques and hypertrichosis may also be seen.\nPorphyrins are important in the formation of haemoglobin, myoglobin and cytochromes.\nThe porphyrias are diseases in which specific enzyme deficiencies lead to the accumulation of intermediate metabolites in the porphyrin biosynthesis pathway. Porphyrins  删除换行1 absorb light in the 400–405 nm range (the lower range of visible light). This absorbed  删除换行1 light is then transferred to cellular structures, causing damage to tissues. Deficiency of  删除换行1 the enzyme uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD) is responsible for PCT, which may  删除换行1 be inherited or acquired. Patients with acquired disease are deficient in UROD in their  删除换行1 liver and therefore express the disease phenotypically when triggered by agents such as  删除换行1 alcohol, oestrogen and hepatitis C. Familial PCT is inherited in an autosomal dominant  删除换行1 fashion with a resultant defect in the synthesis of UROD.\nA skin biopsy reveals subepidermal bullae. Wood’s lamp examination of the urine shows  删除换行1 orange red fluorescence. A porphyrin screen reveals raised uroporphyrin I in the urine  删除换行1 and increased levels of isocoproporphyrins in the stool.\n\n【13】Treatments include eliminating possible trigger factors such as alcohol.

Propagation of an action potential to the presynaptic terminal\n\n【2】B. Release of neurotransmitter in response to nerve terminal depolarization\n\n【3】C.Response of the postsynaptic cell to neurotransmitter\n\n【4】D.Removal of neurotransmitter from the synaptic cleft\n\n【5】8.2 A 27-year-old man is brought into the emergency room with complaints of severe nausea and vomiting as well as diplopia and weakness. His friend reports he cans his own vegetables and had eaten some the previous evening. Your initial suspicion is that this man has botulism， and you immediately administer botulinum antitoxin. Which of the following processes involved in neurotrans mission is inhibited by botulinum toxin?\n\n【6】A1.1Anterograde axonal transport which delivers neurotransmitter precursors to the synaptic terminal\n\n【7】B. Synthesis of neurotransmitter in the presynaptic terminal\n\n【8】C.IPackaging of neurotransmitter into synaptic vesicles\n\n【9】D.Fusion of the synaptic vesicles with the neuronal membrane， resulting in neurotransmitter release\n\n【10】8.3Which of following best describes the kiss-and-run model of synaptic vesicle recovery!\n\n【11】A.Synaptic vesicles completely fuse with the presynaptic membrane， releas-ing their contents into the synaptic cleft. The vesicle components are then recovered by clathrin-mediated endocytosis.\n\n【12】B. Synaptic vesicles completely fuse with the presynaptic membrane， releas- ing their contents into the synaptic cleft. The vesicle components are then recovered by endocytosis without clathrin-coated pits.\n\n【13】Synaptic vesicles approach the presynaptic membrane but do not com-pletely fuse with it. They open pores with the membrane， releasing their contents into the synaptic cleft， and then separate from the membrane intact.\n\n【14】D删除38：<u>)</u>.Synaptic vesicles fuse with the presynaptic membrane， releasing their con-tents into the synaptic cleft. The vesicle components are not recovered， but rather new components are synthesized in the soma and transported to the presynaptic terminal.\nANSWERS\n\n【15】8.1 B. BecauseEaton-Lambert syndrome is a disorder that stems from destruction of the presynaptic calcium channels， it follows that those steps in neurotransmis-sion that directly involve calcium channels， specifically release of neurotrans-mitter in response to nerve terminal depolarization， would be disrupted. Recall that opening of voltage-gated calcium channels results in calcium influx， which results in fusion of secretory vesicles with the presynaptic membrane and release of neurotransmitter into the cleft. Action potentials depend on sodium and potassium channels， so destruction of calcium channels will not prevent them. In Eaton-Lambert syndrome， there is a deficient response of the postsyn aptic cell， but this is not caused by a disruption in response to neurotransmitter. Rather， it is because there is insufficient neurotransmitter released. The ability of the postsynaptic cell to respond remains intact； there is simply nothing to respond to. Removal of neurotransmitter from the synaptic cleft is unaffected by the loss of calcium channels.\n\n【16】8.2 D. Botulinum toxin binds to and inactivates the acetylcholine synaptic vesicle docking complex， which normally facilitates the fusion of the synaptic vesi-cles with the neuronal membrane， allowing neurotransmitter release. This prevents fusion of the vesicle with the presynaptic membrane and release into the synaptic cleft. The other steps listed in the question are not inhibited by botulinum toxin. Packaging of norepinephrine into vesicles is inhibited by the drug reserpine.\n\n【17】8.3 C. Answer C accurately describes the kiss-and-run pathway. Answers A and B describe the classical pathway for vesicle recycling and the bulk endocy-tosis pathways， respectively. Answer D is not a described method for vesicle recycling.\n\n【18】NEUROSCIENCE PEARLS\n\n【19】 Botulinum toxin is an exotoxin secreted by Clostridium botulinum， and has a protease effect， cleaving integral membrane proteins of the acetylcholine-containing presynaptic vesicles.\n\n【20】The decreased levels of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction produce the weakness that is the hallmark of botulism poisoning.\n\n【21】Ca²+ (the influx of which is triggered by membrane depolarization) is nec-essary for the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the neuronal membrane and the release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft.\n\n【22】The amount of neurotransmitter released is directly proportional to the influx of Ca+ ions.\n\n【23】Synaptic vesicles in the cytosol are anchored in place to cytoskeletal filaments by proteins called synapsins.\n\n【24】TThe three known pathways by which synaptic membranes are retrieved are the classical pathway， the kiss-and-run pathway， and the bulk endo-cytosis pathway.\n\n【25】The classical pathway describes retrieval by endocytosis of the synaptic membrane by means of clathrin-coated pits.\n\n【26】TThe kiss-and-run pathway states that instead of the vesicle completely fusing with the presynaptic membrane， the vesicle’s fusion pore opens to release the neurotransmitter and then closes so the vesicle can be recycled.\n\n【27】The bulk endocytosis pathway describes retrieval of excess membrane without the use of clathrin-coated pits.",

She has a 2-year history of acne vulgaris unresponsive to herbal remedies, topical retinoid agents, and combined topical antibiotic/benzoyl peroxide preparations. She reports that within the past 3 months she has suffered significant discomfort and public embarrassment from the inflamed deep cysts. She is here to get a second opinion about how to improve her acne, stating that her general practitioner has done everything in his power to help her.\n\n【12】Ms. Austin’s past medical history is unremarkable, and she is currently not taking any medications. Physical exam reveals mixed severe inflammatory and moderate nodulocystic acne. Surprisingly, it appears that she has never been given oral antibiotics or oral retinoids. When you broach the subject of trying an oral antibiotic agent in combination with her topical regimen, her strong rejection of your recommendation takes you aback: “Is this a pill, Doctor? I don’t want to take any pills because they are not good for my body. I have heard many horror stories about people having bad side effects while taking pills. These cysts are terrible, but they don’t kill me – I would rather leave them alone than taking pills to make them disappear.”\n\n【13】Teaching Points\n---------------\n\n【14】Ms. Austin reminds us that the same medical information can be perceived very differently from patient to patient. Some patients have no problems taking systemic medications despite clear warnings about significant yet rare adverse effects, while others are reluctant to take anything internally. It is the practitioner’s responsibility to sort out the patient’s fears so that the best approach to controlling her severe cystic acne is ultimately discussed. All of the basic communication and interpersonal skills (e.g. reflective listening, refraining from interrupting the patient, sitting instead of standing while talking to the patient, etc.) are key ingredients in developing a good relationship with a patient who might be fearful of possible adverse effects.\n\n【15】“Ms. Austin, would it be okay if I asked you what questions or concerns you have about this medicine? I promise to do my best to answer them.” A few good things have been demonstrated in these sentences. First, you have shown respect by asking for permission to delve into her fears. Second, you have left an open space for the patient to fill in by phrasing your question as an open-ended request. “What questions or concerns you have” is preferred over asking, “Ms. Austin, do you have any concerns about this medication?” If she is ambivalent about verbalizing her concerns, a close-ended question can easily lead to her answering “no.” Third, the simple phrase “I promise ( or I will try) to do my best to answer them” is designed to make the patient feel reassured and comfortable with discussing issues that might have induced her emotional distress.\n\n【16】Similarly, if the fear is due to uncertainty about whether or not a medication will be therapeutic, then the optimal approach may involve providing reassurance and support. Of note, reassurance can be empty when you have not effectively conveyed that you share Ms. Austin’s perspective. Simple things such as smiling, leaning your body toward the patient when she narrates, demonstrating empathic communication (i.e. naming the emotion she seems to be expressing, understanding, respecting, and supporting her feelings), are all powerful ways to achieve this goal. It may be appropriate to indicate that you have had experiences similar to Ms. Austin’s current situation, without disclosing personal details (i.e. “What I am asking you to do might make you feel nervous. I know this because I have been a patient on a few occasions and got to see things from the other side.”). Showing this patient that you are a vulnerable human being while still maintaining your professionalism (i.e. refraining from over-sharing) might actually help you develop a stronger bond with her.\n\n【17】In addition, it is common for patients to become fearful due to information they have learned that does not apply to their skin diseases. Thanks to the Internet, dermatologic patients can readily access any information available to the public at the click of a mouse. Unfortunately, there has not been any well-established Internet “filter” to help them navigate through this large well of information. Thus, you might have to provide some guidance for your patients in this regard. For instance, Ms. Austin might disclose, “I read on this blog by a young woman close to my age that she took some pill the doctor gave her for acne, and then her face swelled up like a balloon. That really freaked me out, Doctor.” This has been termed “Google terror” by Dr. Neil Prose because the patient’s fear is a result of her learning information that is erroneous, pertaining to extremely rare events, or non-applicable to her case.\n\n【18】In the hypothetical example above, the authors recommend not immediately rebuffing the likelihood of her face swelling up like a balloon, as this might make you appear dismissive to the patient. Please think of it as a legitimate concern. You should compliment Ms. Austin for having done her research on the skin disease: “I applaud you for spending time and effort to learn more about acne. It is often helpful to know that other people have similar experiences as you.” After positively reinforcing her self-efficacy (i.e. the idea that the patient can do a lot to improve her condition), the next moment is a good opportunity to counter her negative impression of the medication, “Ms. Austin, what I am saying is based on my medical knowledge as well as personal experience prescribing these acne pills to many patients. It is very unlikely that your face will swell up like a balloon if you take them the way I ask you to. I understand your concern, but I don’t think that we should worry about it right now.”\n\n【19】According to Dr. Prose, one way to prevent “Google terror” is to anticipate what the patient will possibly find and warn her in advance: “Ms. Austin, you might run across something called acne inversa and descriptions of painful boils in the groin, armpits, or buttocks. This is not what you have, so if I may say this, please ignore it.” This is a strategy to help the patient filter out inappropriate information on the Internet. As a result, she will likely be less anxious before and during subsequent visits, and you can focus your time and energy in those visits to address her legitimate concern",

He is usually fairly independent, looking after himself and going  删除换行1 to the local shops, but he has been unwell for two weeks with a chest infection. His GP prescribed a week’s course of an antibiotic but that did not help. He had a cough with yellow  删除换行1 sputum and was short of breath. He became increasingly lethargic and drowsy, taking to his  删除换行1 bed in the past few days. He has had type 2 diabetes for 15 years and is taking metformin and  删除换行1 gliclazide. His other medications include ramipril for hypertension, aspirin for a previous transient ischaemic attack (TIA) and simvastatin. He does not drink alcohol and is an ex-smoker.\n\n【3】Examination\nThe man’s mucous membranes appear dry and he has cool peripheries. His jugular venous  删除换行1 pulse (JVP) is not visible and heart sounds are normal. He has inspiratory crackles and  删除换行1 bronchial breathing in the right base. His abdominal examination is normal. His reflexes  删除换行1 are normal. Pupils are equal and reactive to light. His score on the Glasgow Coma Scale  删除换行1 is 8/15 (does not open eyes, localizes to pain, makes incomprehensible sounds).

In this  删除换行1 case, the serum osmolality works out to be 379 mosmol/kg. He has a mild metabolic  删除换行1 acidosis but significant ketoacidosis is not present (pH >7.3 and only a trace of ketones  删除换行1 in the urine). This condition mostly occurs in those with type 2 diabetes, in contrast to  删除换行1 diabetic ketoacidosis which occurs in type 1 diabetes. However, the distinction is not  删除换行1 absolute and up to a third of cases can present with both elements.\n\n【36】Precipitants of this condition are usually infection (pneumonia and urinary tract infection are the most common). Other acute stressors such as myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident and surgery can trigger the condition. Significant dehydration, which  删除换行1 accompanies this condition, exacerbates electrolyte abnormalities and can cause acute  删除换行1 kidney injury.\n\n【37】In this case it is likely that the patient has a severe community-acquired pneumonia that  删除换行1 has precipitated this state.\nThe approach to any critically ill person should start with ABCDE (airway, breathing,  删除换行1 circulation, disability, exposure). Each step should consist of an assessment and appropriate management before moving on to subsequent stages. This approach is a logical way  删除换行1 of thinking through and dealing with an acutely ill person. This approach is part of the  删除换行5 IMPACT (Ill Medical Patient’s Acute Care and Treatment) method that is endorsed by the \n\n【38】Federation of the Royal Colleges of Physicians and the Royal College of Anaesthetists.\n\n【39】This man’s airway is certainly at risk owing to his low GCS score: 8 or below is an indication that a definitive airway is likely to be needed. An anaesthetist should therefore  删除换行1 be present to manage this. In the meantime, basic techniques to keep the airway open  删除换行1 (head tilt and chin lift or jaw thrust) with or without airway adjuncts (oropharyngeal or  删除换行1 nasopharyngeal airways) can be used. High-flow oxygen (10 L/min) using a mask with  删除换行1 reservoir should be administered to deliver maximal percentage of oxygen (with this  删除换行1 device about 85 per cent oxygen can be given).\n\n【40】Once the airway is secured and oxygen delivered his breathing can be assessed. He is  删除换行1 noted to be tachypnoeic, which is a response to the metabolic acidosis from renal impairment secondary to dehydration and sepsis. Auscultation and chest X-ray showed consolidation at the right base. Saturations are low with a PO2 of 8.2 kPa on air. He has severe  删除换行1 respiratory compromise with type 1 respiratory failure. As well as high-flow oxygen he  删除换行1 may need assisted ventilation and is at risk of respiratory arrest.\n\n【41】He is hypotensive and tachycardic and requires urgent intravenous access and immediate fluid resuscitation. A urinary catheter should be inserted to quantify urinary output.\nShock is defined as inadequate tissue perfusion and several parameters can indicate  删除换行1 this (e.g. renal dysfunction, rise in lactate, consciousness level). Shock is likely to be  删除换行1 caused by hypovolaemia from fluid depletion and sepsis. An ECG does not show signs  删除换行1 of myocardial ischaemia and his JVP is not visible without signs of pulmonary oedema,  删除换行1 so cardiogenic shock is unlikely. The initial management is the same. Upon intravenous  删除换行1 access a fluid challenge should be given: 250 mL of normal saline should be given over  删除换行1 2 minutes. Response should be checked at 5 minutes. He is likely to be severely dehy-120 删除换行1 drated and will require large volumes of fluid replacement. However, care must be taken  删除换行1 in replacing fluid as he is elderly. In general, the first 2 L of normal saline can be given  删除换行1 over the first 2 hours. He may require additional colloid boluses if he becomes hypotensive. Subsequently care over aggressive fluid resuscitation is required. Sodium should be  删除换行1 reduced slowly and not more than about 10 mmol/L in 24 hours. Further fluid type and  删除换行1 duration of administration should be gauged on renal and electrolyte profiles and the  删除换行1 patient’s haemodynamic status. A central venous line would be helpful to assess central  删除换行1 venous pressure in those at risk of heart failure.\n\n【42】Initial observations showed a temperature of 38°C, tachycardia, tachypnoea, and a raised  删除换行1 white cell count. He also has evidence of organ failure (renal and neurological). He has all  删除换行1 the features of a severe systemic inflammatory response syndrome. It is likely the cause is  删除换行1 pneumonia based on the symptoms and signs present. A urine dip did not show evidence  删除换行1 of infection, but he should have blood and urine cultures. The combination of hypovolaemic and septic shock is unlikely to respond to fluid resuscitation alone and he will need  删除换行1 vasopressor support if he remains hypotensive. Septic shock is associated with a high  删除换行1 mortality, up to 50 per cent in some cases. Multi-organ failure is a poor prognostic sign.\n\n【43】In addition to fluids, once sepsis is recognized he should be given antibiotics urgently  删除换行1 within the first hour of recognition as advocated by the surviving sepsis campaign . Antibiotics should ideally be targeted to the underlying source,  删除换行1 but broad-spectrum organism cover should be initiated without delay.\n\n【44】Serum glucose is corrected slowly with fluid resuscitation and an insulin sliding scale.\nPotassium levels should be checked every hour in the first 4 hours during fluid resuscitation, as they are likely to decrease as the acidosis improves and the intravascular volume  删除换行1 increases.\n\n【45】Renal failure may be exacerbated by underlying diabetes and hypertension, as well as  删除换行1 metformin and ramipril. Renal function and hyperkalaemia may improve with fluid  删除换行1 resuscitation alone, but renal replacement therapy may be required.\n\n【46】The hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state is a hypercoagulable condition and thromboprophylaxis is required.\n\n【47】Recognizing that this patient is critically ill is based on the ABCDE approach. Most of  删除换行1 the initial management can be instituted in the acute setting, including intubation and  删除换行1 invasive monitoring. Once the patient is stable enough he should be transferred to the  删除换行1 intensive-care unit for continued management.\n\n【48】KEY POINTS\n\n【49】• Hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state is a serious complication that occurs most  删除换行1 commonly in elderly people with type 2 diabetes.\n\n【50】• A common trigger for this is infection.\n\n【51】• Coma is rare but is more likely in those presenting with hypernatraemia.",

        "text": "【0】CASE 89: FRONTAL HAIR LOSS IN A WOMAN\n\n【1】History\n\n【2】A 55-year-old woman presents with an 18-month history of hair thinning over her  删除换行1 frontal scalp. She denies any symptoms from her scalp and has not lost hair elsewhere.\nShe takes hormone replacement therapy and is otherwise well. Her brother and father  删除换行1 had both suffered with male pattern baldness in their 40s. Her mother has always had a  删除换行1 ‘good head of hair’.\nExamination\n\n【3】There is diffuse thinning of her hair over the frontal scalp extending to the vertex  删除换行1 删除33：<u></u>. The hair that is present is finer in texture and shorter than the hair over the  删除换行1 rest of her scalp. The scalp skin appears normal as are her nails.\n\n【4】Questions\n\n【5】• What is the diagnosis?\n\n【6】• What are the potential treatment options?\n\n【7】删除3：<u>Figure 89.1198</u>\n\n【8】ANSWER 89\n\n【9】This patient is suffering from androgenetic alopecia. She has noticed gradual thinning  删除换行1 of her hair, particularly over the frontal scalp and vertex. The family history of hair loss  删除换行1 in men is relevant.\n\n【10】Androgenetic alopecia is a very common, progressive hair loss that occurs predominantly  删除换行1 in men (male pattern baldness). This occurs due to the combined effect of genetic predisposition and the action of androgens on hair follicles. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is  删除换行1 believed to shorten the anagen phase (growth phase) causing miniaturization of the hair  删除换行1 follicle which then produces finer hairs. The genetic predisposition can be inherited from  删除换行1 either parent. In men this can occur at any time after puberty as early as in late teens and  删除换行1 is present in 80 per cent by the 7th decade. In women it occurs later and the majority of  删除换行1 women will have a normal hormone profile. It is more pronounced after the menopause,  删除换行1 most commonly occurring in the 6th decade.\nAndrogenetic alopecia in men is usually demonstrated by a receding anterior hairline,  删除换行1 particularly in the parietal-temporal region resulting in the classical M-shape of hair loss.\nFollowing this the vertex (crown) may become affected.\nIn women the pattern of hair loss is different. They commonly exhibit loss over the frontal scalp and the parietal and temporal regions are spared. If a young woman presents  删除换行1 with this pattern of hair loss then she should be examined for signs of virilization such  删除换行1 as clitoral hypertrophy, acne and hirsutism. If present, an underlying systemic endocrine  删除换行1 disease should be excluded. Testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate levels  删除换行1 should be measured.\n\n【11】Treatment options include hairpieces such as wigs/weaves and toupées. Topical minoxidil  删除换行1 can be effective in some patients in reducing and partially restoring hair loss. Once discontinued though, the effect is lost. Finasteride, which inhibits 5-\f-reductase (an enzyme  删除换行1 that regulates production of DHT), can slow down hair loss in men. In women who have  删除换行1 elevated adrenal androgens, anti-androgen drugs such as spironolactone, cyproterone  删除换行1 and cimetidine can be effective. Finally, there may be a role for hair transplantation in  删除换行1 some patients.\n\n【12】 KEY POINTS\n\n【13】• Androgenetic alopecia is a common, progressive hair loss occurring predominantly in  删除换行1 men.\n\n【14】• Genetic predisposition and the effect of androgens on follicles leads to male pattern  删除换行1 baldness.\n\n【15】• In women underlying systemic endocrine disease should be excluded.",

DiMaria\n删除个例：<u>Children’s Hospital Colorado, Aurora, CO, USA</u>\n</u>\nA full‐term previously healthy 18‐month‐old female presents to the emergency department (ED) with 2 days of diarrhea, emesis, and low‐grade fever.\n增加换行1: History of Present Illness\n--------------------------\n\n【2】The toddler was in her usual state of health until 3 days prior to presentation at which time she developed decreased appetite and intermittent complaints of abdominal pain. The following day, she developed a tactile temperature and had frequent bowel movements. Her mother reports that the stools were loose. The day prior to presentation, she developed emesis and was unable to keep any food or liquids down. The mother reported frequent trips to the bathroom for vomiting and diarrhea. The mother encouraged fluids but was only able to get the child to take sips throughout the day. Overnight, she was restless, febrile to 38.3°C (100.9°F), and complaining of a worsening “tummy ache.” This morning, the mother noticed that the child appeared tired and pale, so she was brought to the ED for further evaluation.\n增加换行1: Past Medical History\n--------------------\n\n【3】Born at full term via scheduled cesarean section. She had APGAR scores of 7 and 9 after birth and was discharged home with mother on day of life 3. She was closely followed by primary care physician (PCP) for slow weight gain during the first 3 months of life that improved after initiation of formula supplementation. She has had multiple upper respiratory tract infections and one episode of acute otitis media that required antibiotics. She is otherwise healthy, meeting developmental milestones and tracking consistently at the 25th percentile on the growth curve. Her vaccinations are up to date, including seasonal influenza vaccine. She has no known drug allergies. No hospitalizations.\n增加换行1: Past Surgical History\n---------------------\n\n【4】No previous surgeries.\n增加换行1: Family History\n--------------\n\n【5】Aunt with colon cancer, mother with asthma. Three healthy older siblings.\n增加换行1: Current Status\n--------------\n\n【6】She is a well‐developed toddler sleeping in her mother’s lap.\n\n【7】Vital signs in ED triage as follows: temperature 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate 130 bpm, respiratory rate 35 breaths per minute, blood pressure 92/55 mmHg, oxygen saturations 96% on room air.\n\n【8】She appears lethargic, but irritable with examination. Her eyes are slightly sunken and mucous membranes are dry. No tears are noted when crying during examination. Her capillary refill time is 4 seconds and she has 2+ pulses in all extremities. She cries out when the examiner attempts to palpate her abdomen, but all four quadrants are palpated without evidence of tenderness. Her abdomen is round, soft, and non‐distended. No hepatosplenomegaly. Hyperactive bowel sounds are present.\n增加换行1: Questions\n---------\n\n【9】Answer the following questions using the details provided.\n\n【10】1.  Based on the data given, what is the differential diagnosis and the most likely diagnosis for this child?\n2.  What are the essential questions to ask while obtaining the history?\n3.  What are the initial steps of management?\n4.  How would you evaluate the child’s hydration status?\n5.  What is your management plan?Rationale and Evidence‐based Practice Explanation\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】### Based on the data given, what is the differential diagnosis and the most likely diagnosis for this child?\n\n【12】The initial differential diagnosis is broad and includes gastroenteritis, appendicitis, central nervous system infection, bowel obstruction, bowel perforation/acute abdomen, diabetes ketoacidosis, and ingestion. When further considering the differential diagnosis, appendicitis is on the list because of fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and lethargy, though is less likely due to absence of rebound tenderness or tender abdomen. Central nervous system infection is considered on the differential diagnosis due to fever, emesis, and altered mental status (lethargic and irritable); a thorough neurologic examination including assessment for nuchal rigidity is needed. Bowel obstruction is considered in the differential due to frequent emesis coupled with abdominal pain, though is less likely because the emesis is not bilious and the patient is having diarrhea. A bowel perforation/acute abdomen is unlikely because of reassuring abdominal examination. Diabetic ketoacidosis is considered in the differential diagnosis due to presenting emesis, evidence of dehydration, and mental status changes, but is not accompanied by Kussmaul breathing or polyuria. Toxic ingestion should also be considered, though is less likely due to low‐grade fever and prolonged illness.\n\n【13】The most likely diagnosis for this patient is gastroenteritis because of the symptoms of diarrhea, low‐grade fever, abdominal pain, and emesis in the absence of a rigid and tender abdomen and without focal neurologic symptoms. Gastroenteritis is defined as acute onset of diarrheal illness (e.g. increase in stool frequency and/or decrease in stool consistency) that can occur either in isolation or in combination with nausea, emesis, fever, and abdominal pain. Acute gastroenteritis typically lasts less than 7 days. It is a common illness, especially in children under 5 years of age. The highest incidence of dehydration is in children under 6 months of age. Most commonly, gastroenteritis is the result of infection with rotavirus, norovirus, adenovirus, Salmonella , Campylobacter , and Clostridium difficile . Etiology varies by geographic location and vaccination against rotavirus. Diarrheal illness characterized by frequent small amounts of stool, bloody stool, high fever, and abdominal pain are most likely to be associated with a bacterial etiology.\n\n【14】### What are essential questions to ask while obtaining the history?\n\n【15】Essential elements of the history include onset and duration of the emesis, including color (bloody, bilious) and timing (immediately after eating?); onset and color (blood, mucus) of diarrhea; fluid intake and urinary output (dysuria?); immunization history (specifically rotavirus vaccination); and contact with others with similar symptoms.\n\n【16】### What are the initial steps of management?\n\n【17】Priority is given to evaluation for presence of hypovolemic shock. If present, this must be treated immediately, as it can be life‐threatening. The child’s level of dehydration should be evaluated and treatment targeted to level of dehydration and replacement of ongoing losses. Other steps in management include initiating an age‐appropriate diet, determining the disposition (e.g. does the child require hospitalization?), and considering an antiemetic if emesis prohibits effective oral rehydration therapy or for patient comfort.\n\n【18】In general, children with acute gastroenteritis do not require diagnostic evaluation with stool studies except when the child has underlying chronic conditions, prolonged symptoms, bloody diarrhea, travel history, or during outbreaks.\n\n【19】### How would you evaluate the child’s hydration status?\n\n【20】The largest driver of morbidity and hospitalization rates associated with acute gastroenteritis is dehydration. The exact proportion of a patient’s dehydration is thought to be represented by the difference in their pre‐illness weight and their weight at time of presentation. This assessment is limited in its utility because most parents are unsure of the patient’s exact pre‐illness weight. Because of this limitation, most clinicians rely on a clinical dehydration scale which incorporates presenting symptoms to categorize the patient as having minimal (<3% loss of body weight), mild to moderate (3–9% loss of body weight), or severe (>9% of body weight) dehydration. Multiple clinical dehydration scales have been developed by several organizations . The various scales vary in their reliability in predicting actual dehydration, but can give a healthcare provider an estimate of a patient’s dehydration status that will assist with creating a management plan. All scoring tools must be used in conjunction with the individual clinical examination and history. Newer methods for estimating dehydration status have been evaluated, including ultrasound to measure inferior vena cava diameter, the ratio of inferior vena cava to aorta diameter, and bedside hand‐held bladder ultrasound scanning and digital videography to measure capillary refill time.\n\n【21】Table 4.1 Clinical dehydration scale.\n\n【22】通用删除2(英):<u>删除31：<u>Source: Guarino, A.

Oral rehydration therapy is recommended for mild to moderate cases of acute gastroenteritis. She warrants close observation and may require intravenous fluid therapy. She should be offered an oral rehydration fluid instead of water, juice, or a sports electrolyte drink. She has lost electrolytes because of her diarrhea and emesis and therefore water would not meet her electrolyte replacement needs. A high‐glucose solution (most common in juice or sports drinks) can exacerbate diarrhea. Ideally, an oral rehydration fluid would have a 1 : 1 glucose to sodium ratio. She should be offered 50–100 mL/kg body weight of oral rehydration fluid over 2–4 hours to replace the estimated fluid deficit. Caregivers should offer small amounts of oral rehydration therapy via spoon or syringe, allowing her to drink more if she appears thirsty. In breast‐fed infants, breastfeeding should continue through oral rehydration therapy. An age‐appropriate diet can be initiated after the initial 4–6 hours of rehydration. Modified milk formula and dilution of formula is generally not needed. Enteral hydration by nasogastric route is preferred over intravenous hydration when oral rehydration is not feasible.\n\n【28】The patient requires assessment of ongoing fluid losses and replacement as needed. An antiemetic such as ondansetron can be prescribed if the child is unable to drink the prescribed amount of fluid without continued emesis. Probiotic therapy has been associated with reduction in the duration of diarrhea, but there is limited evidence of its impact on duration of hospitalization.\n\n【29】The patient does not meet hospital admission criteria at this time. However, if she were unable to complete oral rehydration therapy because of ongoing emesis or diarrhea, if oral rehydration therapy at home was unsuccessful, or if she developed signs of hypovolemic shock, she would warrant either prolonged observation in the ED or hospital admission. No laboratory studies or intravenous fluids are indicated currently. Additionally, a basic metabolic panel to assess electrolytes, specifically sodium, as well as blood urea nitrogen and creatinine to assess renal function and severity of dehydration, could be considered if she was refractory to oral rehydration therapy and developed severe dehydration. Antibiotics are not a recommended therapy for acute gastroenteritis.\n\n【30】The patient requires ongoing monitoring of end‐organ perfusion and level of hydration, and for symptoms of acute abdominal process such as appendicitis, bowel obstruction, or perforation, which are less common. If she improves after tolerating oral rehydration therapy, she can be safely discharged home with strict return instructions for deterioration in status.",

She began to notice brown spots on her cheeks a year ago but they have recently started to form into patches. The brown patches are not painful and do not itch, but they are not cosmetically appealing and have caused severe distress. She has a history of birth control pill use during her twenties and has two children. She noticed the brown spots worsening during pregnancy. She wears a moisturizer daily, but does not wear sunscreen. She is an avid gardener.\n\n【13】Physican Examination\n--------------------\n\n【14】There are scattered, hyperpigmented macules coalescing into reticular patches on her forehead, cheeks, nose, and upper lip 删除33：<u></u>.\n\n【15】删除3：<u>Figure 14.1\n\n【16】Centrofacial melasma. Brown, reticular patches are noted on the forehead, cheeks, upper lip, nose, and chin</u>\n\n【17】Differential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【18】The patient’s clinical presentation was most consistent with melasma. Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation may present with brown macules and associated erythema, scale, and pruritus secondary to photosensitivity reactions or irritant contact dermatitis. Solar lentigines are secondary to ultraviolet radiation and present as round, flat, well-circumscribed macules in sun exposed sites. Drug-induced photosensitivity due to thiazides or tetracyclines may present as irregularly shaped hyperpigmentation. Actinic lichen planus often presents on the temples and may involve the neck and intertriginous sites. Exogenous ochronosis presents with hyperpigmentation followed by progressive darkening with superimposed pigmented papules. Acquired bilateral nevus of Ota-like macules (Hori’s nevi) presents with multiple brown to gray to blue macules, primarily on the malar region. It is usually more common in Asian females 删除10：<u>(Chung 2008 )</u>.\n\n【19】Wood’s Lamp Examination\n-----------------------\n\n【20】Wood’s lamp examination (365 nm) shows accentuation or darkening of the hyperpigmented patches.\n\n【21】Histopathology\n--------------\n\n【22】Melasma is typically a clinical diagnosis; however, if a biopsy were performed, pathology would show epidermal melanin in basal and suprabasal keratinocytes. The number of melanocytes is not increased; however, the melanocytes that are present are larger, more dendritic, and more active. Inflammation is typically absent 删除10：<u>(Chung 2008 )</u>.\n\n【23】Diagnosis\n---------\n\n【24】Epidermal melasma\n\n【25】Case Treatment\n--------------\n\n【26】The likely etiology of melasma, including her oral contraceptive usage, pregnancy, and sun exposure was discussed. A triple combination compound consisting of hydroquinone 6 % + tretinoin 0.025 % + fluocinolone 0.01 % cream was started every other night to the dark areas only. The patient was recommended to increase the cream to nightly after 1 week if she had no burning or irritation. A broad spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 was recommended daily. Daily use of Polypodium leucotomos was recommended as a supplement. A 3 month follow-up was recommended. After mild improvement was seen, she was started on a series of three 35 % glycolic acid peels every 4 weeks in addition to her topical regimen.\n\n【27】Discussion\n----------\n\n【28】Melasma is a common acquired disorder of hyperpigmentation that is found mostly in Latina, Southeast Asian, and African American women with Fitzpatrick skin types III-V. Women are more prone to developing the disease than men, especially after the woman has experienced childbirth—leading to the common term, “the mask of pregnancy.” Melasma is worsened by excess exposure to the sun; therefore, it is more common in those living in areas with intense ultraviolet radiation exposure 删除10：<u>(Sheth and Pandya 2011a )</u>. A recent multicenter survey from nine countries found that 41 % of women had onset of the disorder after pregnancy but before menopause. Only 8 % noted spontaneous remission, and 25 % had onset after starting their contraceptive 删除10：<u>(Ortonne et al. 2009 )</u>.\n\n【29】The exact cause of melasma is unknown. The high incidence among family members suggest a genetic component, and various surveys from around the world report 10–70 % of family members being involved 删除10：<u>(Ortonne et al. 2009 )</u>. Sun exposure is likely an exacerbating factor because of the ultraviolet induced upregulation of melanocyte proliferation, migration, and melanogenesis 删除10：<u>(Sheth and Pandya 2011a )</u>. While melasma is known to occur with hormonal changes, clinical evidence to date does not clearly associate serum hormone levels to melasma. Perez et al examined the link between circulating hormones and found that nulligravid women with melasma had significantly higher serum levels of luteinizing hormone and lower levels of estradiol than their counterpart controls, though further research is needed 删除10：<u>(Perez et al. 1983 )</u>. Several studies have noted the onset of melasma with oral contraceptive use and pregnancy. Therefore, it is recommended that patients who develop melasma while taking an oral contraceptive should stop the medication and avoid future use of such drugs when possible 删除10：<u>(Sheth and Pandya 2011a )</u>. However, stopping the culprit oral contraceptive will not necessarily reverse melasma. Some studies have suggested that mild abnormalities in thyroid function are associated with oral contraceptive or pregnancy related melasma; therefore, it is reasonable to consider checking thyroid function tests in melasma patients 删除10：<u>(Lutfi et al. 1985 )</u>.\n\n【30】Melasma presents as symmetrically distributed hyperpigmented macules that coalesce into reticular patches. There are three distribution patterns. Centrofacial melasma, the most common pattern, involves the forehead, cheeks, upper lip, nose, and chin 删除33：<u></u>. The malar pattern is limited to the cheeks and the nose 删除33：<u></u>, and the mandibular pattern is specific to the jawline. Histologically, melasma may be divided into three subtypes. In epidermal melasma, melanin is increased in the epidermis, and patients present with tan to brown hyperpigmentation. In dermal melasma, melanin is found in superficial and mid dermal macrophages, which often congregate around small, dilated vessels, and patients present with a bluish discoloration 删除33：<u></u>. Dermal melasma is typically harder to treat. In mixed melasma, melanin is found in both the epidermis and the dermis. In most cases, the number of melanocytes is not increased, yet the melanocytes that are present are larger, more dendritic, and more active. Inflammation is sparse or absent 删除10：<u>(Kang et al. 2002 )</u>.\n\n【31】删除3：<u>Figure 14.2\n\n【32】Malar melasma. Brown, reticular patches are noted on the medial cheeks and nose</u>\n\n【33】删除3：<u>Figure 14.3\n\n【34】Dermal melasma. Brown-bluish discoloration is noted on the bilateral malar cheeks</u>\n\n【35】The excess melanin can be visually localized to the epidermis or the dermis by use of a Wood’s lamp. Epidermal pigment is enhanced during examination with a Wood’s light, whereas, dermal pigment is not. Lesions that have both enhancing and nonenhancing areas have a mixed pattern.\n\n【36】Treatment\n---------\n\n【37】Melasma is often difficult to treat and has a significant negative impact on patients’ quality of life. The ultimate goal of melasma management is to lighten the affected area enough so that it is even with the rest of the skin. This can be difficult when treating patients with skin of color.\n\n【38】First line therapy involves topical compounds that affect the pigment production pathway. Topical hydroquinone is the most common topical treatment used for melasma. Hydroquinone is a tyrosinase inhibitor, which primarily leads to decreased melanin production, along with altered melanosome formation and increased melanosome destruction 删除10：<u>(Jimbow et al. 1974 )</u>. Ennes et al found that 38 % of patients treated with 4 % hydroquinone cream once daily for 12 weeks had a complete clinical response compared to only 8 % in the placebo group 删除10：<u>(Ennes et al. 2000 )</u>. There is some controversy over the use of hydroquinone. Although rare in the United States, there have been several reports of exogenous ochronosis, a bluish-gray discoloration, after the use of hydroquinone cream, especially in South African blacks 删除10：<u>(Sheth and Pandya 2011b )</u>. One explanation for the high incidence in South Africans is that patients outside of the United States have uncontrolled access to over the counter high concentrations of hydroquinone 删除10：<u>(Olumide et al. 2008 )</u>, often mixed with topical steroids, and used for long periods of time\n\n【39】Topical tretinoin cream is also an effective treatment, but often causes irritation and usually requires months to show improvement as monotherapy. The combination of hydroquinone, a retinoid, and a topical steroid appear to be highly effective for the treatment of melasma, with the Kligman-Willis Formula – 5 % hydroquinone, 0.1 % tretinoin, 0.1 % dexamethasone, and a hydrophilic ointment being the originally studied combination 删除10：<u>(Kligman and Willis 1975 )</u>. The theory behind the effectiveness is that tretinoin prevents the oxidation of hydroquinone and improves epidermal penetration while the steroid reduces the irritation side effect of both. Side effects include erythema, desquamation, burning, and pruritus. Because irritation may lead to post inflammatory hyperpigmentation in patients with darker skin types, there are other topical agents that are available. These include azelaic acid, kojic acid, and ascorbic acid (vitamin C), all which may be less efficacious than hydroquinone but typically have less irritation.\n\n【40】Because ultraviolet and visible light can induce melanin formation, regular use of a broad spectrum sunscreen is effective both in preventing melasma and in enhancing the efficacy of other topical therapies once melasma has developed. It is recommended that all patients with melasma use a UVA and UVB protective sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 preferentially with a physical blocker, such as titanium dioxide or zinc oxide. Patients should also wear wide brimmed hats and protective clothing when outdoors. Many patients also use camouflage make-ups, with the most common brands being Dermablend (Vichy Laboratories, Paris, France), Covermark/CM Beauty (CM Beauty, Northvale, NJ), and Cover FX (Cover FX, Skin Care, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) 删除10：<u>(Sheth and Pandya 2011b )</u>.\n\n【41】Chemical peels can also improve melasma by removing unwanted melanin. However, they must be used with caution in skin of color, as they can cause irritation which can lead to postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. Glycolic acid peels are alpha hydroxyl acids that lead to epidermal remodeling, accelerated desquamation and pigment dispersion, along with inhibition of tyrosinase. When used in combination with a modified Kligman-Willis formula (5 % hydroquinone + 0.05 % tretinoin + 1 % hydrocortisone acetate), there was a decrease in the melasma area and severity index (MASI) by 79.9 % 删除10：<u>(Sarkar et al. 2002 )</u>. Salicylic acid peels, which are beta hydroxyl acids, have also been used for melasma, especially in Fitzpatrick skin types V and VI 删除10：<u>(Grimes 1999 )</u>.\n\n【42】The use of lasers have inconsistent results and is challenging because damage to surrounding tissue and subsequent inflammation can lead to postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. Fractional resurfacing is the only laser approved by the FDA for treatment of melasma. The microthermal zones of injury limit the area of skin that is damaged with each treatment, which may decrease the risk of postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. Studies have been limited to Fitzpatrick skin types III-IV 删除10：<u>(Rokhsar and Fitzpatrick 2005 ; Goldberg et al. 2008 )</u>. Q-switched Nd:YAG lasers appear to have an increased risk of hyperpigmentation and a very high rate of relapse following treatment. Intense pulsed light therapy has been shown to be effective in improving melasma but is also characterized by a high relapse rate. In general, laser and light therapies show the best response in lighter-skinned individuals and should be used very carefully, particularly in dark-skinned patients 删除10：<u>(Rivas and Pandya 2013 )</u>. The use of lasers for melasma should be restricted to cases unresponsive to topical therapy or chemical peels. Appropriate maintenance therapy should be selected to avoid relapse 删除10：<u>(Arora et al. 2012 )</u>.\n\n【43】Recently, orally administered Polypodium leucotomos has been shown to be beneficial for the prevention and potential treatment of several aesthetically relevant conditions, including melasma, due to the presence of its antioxidant and photoprotective properties. In a randomized, placebo-controlled study by Ahmed et al, the oral administration of Polypodium leucotomos as an adjunct to sunscreen improved the severity of melasma in women after 12 weeks. No adverse events have been associated with the use of Polypodium leucotomos. Therefore, Polypodium leucotomos appears to provide adjunctive benefits in treating melasma; however, more data with larger sample sizes are needed 删除10：<u>(Ahmed et al. 2013 )</u>.\n\n【44】Key Points\n\n【45】   Melasma is worsened by exposure to ultraviolet radiation, oral contraceptives, and pregnancy.\n   Regular use of a broad spectrum sunscreen is effective both in preventing melasma and in enhancing the efficacy of other topical therapies once melasma has developed.\n   First line therapy involves topical compounds that affect the pigment production pathway, including hydroquinone and tretinoin.\n   In general, laser and light therapies show the best response in lighter-skinned individuals and should be used carefully in dark-skinned patients.",

She has had these symptoms for several days with no significant improvement. She works as a secretary and says these symptoms have been \"going around the office.\"Physical examination reveals small， tender cervical lymphadenopathy， swollen nasal mucosa， and an erythematous pharynx.\n\n【2】What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【3】Infection with influenza virus.\n\n【4】What are the defining structural features of this class of microorganisms?\n\n【5】Orthomyxoviruses are helical， enveloped， negative， single-stranded RNA viruses. Their primary virulence factors are hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. Hemagglutinin aids in the viral entry into host cells whereas neuraminidase aids in progeny release from infected host cells. The isotypes of these two proteins determine the virulence of each particular strain of virus and are the targets of the influenza vaccine.\n\n【6】The patient has had a similar infection in the past. Why is her immune system not protecting her from this illness?\n\n【7】The isotype of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase is constantly changing because of a phenomenon known as antigenic drift. This is the result of random small mutations that cause changes in the antigenic structure of the virus. These mutations result in antigen structures that are only partially recognized by the host immune system.\n\n【8】What characteristic of this microorganism's genome makes deadly epidemics possible?\n\n【9】Influenza A virus infects diverse species including birds， horses， and swine； by contrast， influenza B and influenza C infect only humans. With its segmented genome， influenza A can swap segments of RNA between animal and human strains (a process known as reassortment)， leading to new human strains with novel surface antigens not recognized by the immune system. This type of change is termed antigenic shift and was responsible for the “swine flu\" or hemagglutinin isotype 1 and neuraminidase isotype 1 (H1N1) influenza A virus outbreak in 2009.\n\n【10】What pharmacologic agents can be used as prophylaxis against this infection?\n\n【11】Amantadine and rimantadine block viral penetration by inhibiting the M2 protein responsible for uncoating and can be used to treat influenza A infection. However， these drugs are rarely used anymore because of the high levels of resistance that have developed against them. Instead， zanamivir and oseltamivir(neuraminidase inhibitors) are used to treat both influenza A and influenza B infections. These agents O1 O1are most effective if started within 48 hours of symptom onset. The influenza vaccine should be given in October or November， before the start of flu season. It takes approximately 2 weeks for the body to make antibodies to the viruses. The vaccine generally has four strains； the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determine which among them is likely to be the most infectious each season. The new \"swine flu\" H1N1 strain was included in the 2010 influenza vaccine.",

It is also possible for another person to acquire parental responsibility through a  删除换行1 court order, or it may be given to a legal guardian or a local authority if they have care of the  删除换行1 child.\n\n【6】Legally, consent is required only from one person with parental responsibility. However, it is  删除换行1 clearly good practice to involve both parents where possible, particularly if treatment is invasive or the benefits of treatment do not overwhelmingly outweigh the burdens. In situations  删除换行1 where there is disagreement between parents, a clinician may still proceed with treatment  删除换行1 if it is in the child’s best interests. However, there are a small group of decisions which  删除换行1 should not be taken by one person with parental responsibility against the wishes of another,  删除换行2 e.g. non-therapeutic male circumcision and immunisations.\nWhere there is disagreement between parents and clinical team, a court order should be  删除换行1 obtained before any treatment is given where there is time to do so. The European Court of  删除换行5 Human Rights in Glass v UK 通用删除7(英):<u>(2004)</u> stated that a failure to refer such cases to the court is a  删除换行1 breach of the child’s Article 8 rights.\n\n【7】When a child presents for treatment, it is good medical practice for staff to inquire about the  删除换行1 relationship the accompanying adult has with the child. Rarely would this need to be verified  删除换行1 through other means. Adults other than parents, such as a child-minder or a teacher, cannot  删除换行1 give consent to treatment. Nevertheless the Children Act 1989 authorises a person with care  删除换行1 of a child to do ‘what is reasonable in all the circumstances of the case for the purpose of  删除换行1 safeguarding or promoting the child’s welfare’. This would mean that another adult could  删除换行1 bring a child for a routine assessment and facilitate examination for simple treatment, for  删除换行1 example, tonsillitis.\n\n【8】In an emergency where no parent is present or contactable, urgent treatment which is in  删除换行1 the child’s best interests may be given. This is the case in the above scenario where delay to  删除换行1 examination under anaesthesia could result in long-term problems.\n\n【9】Key Points\n\n【10】• Only one person with parental responsibility needs to consent except in contentious or serious situations.\n\n【11】• Any treatment can be given in an emergency if it is in the child’s best interests and  删除换行1 the person with parental responsibility is not contactable.",

        "text": "【0】### CASE 24\n\n【1】An 8-year-old girl is brought in by her mother for evaluation of allergies. Each year in the spring the child develops a runny nose; itchy, watery eyes; and sneezing. She has been treated in the past with diphenhydramine, but the child’s teacher says that she is very drowsy during school. She has no other medical problems and is on no chronic medications. Her examination is unremarkable today. You diagnose her with seasonal allergic rhinitis and prescribe fexofenadine.\n\n【2】 What is the mechanism of action of antihistamine medications?\n\n【3】 What are the common side effects of antihistamine medications?\n\n【4】 What is the pharmacologic basis of switching to fexofenadine?\n\n【5】ANSWERS TO CASE 24:\n\n【6】Antihistamines\n\n【7】Summary: An 8-year-old girl with seasonal allergic rhinitis is switched to fexofenadine because of the sedation caused by diphenhydramine.\n\n【8】 Mechanism of action of antihistamines: Competitive antagonist of histamine receptors.\n\n【9】 Common side effects: Sedation, dizziness, nausea, constipation, diarrhea, loss of appetite, anticholinergic effects—dry mouth, dry eyes, blurred vision, urinary retention.\n\n【10】 Rationale for switching to fexofenadine: Less central nervous system (CNS) penetration and less sedating than earlier antihistamines.\n\n【11】#### CLINICAL CORRELATION\n\n【12】Histamine is found in many tissues throughout the body. Most histamine is stored in mast cells and basophils. Histamine is released primarily from mast cells via the process of degranulation. Degranulation occurs when immunoglobulin E (IgE) fixates to mast cells, and there is a subsequent exposure to a specific antigen. Complement activation may also induce degranulation. When released, histamine becomes bound to specific membrane-bound histamine receptors. The therapeutic uses of antihistamine medications primarily involve the H <sub>1 </sub> \\-and H <sub>2 </sub> \\-receptor subtypes. H <sub>1 </sub> receptors are located in the brain, heart, bronchi, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and vascular smooth muscle. Their activation increases phospholipase C activity, causing increases in diacylglycerol and intracellular calcium. Activation of H <sub>1 </sub> receptors in the brain increases wakefulness. In blood vessels, activation causes vasodilation and increased permeability. H <sub>1 </sub> \\-receptor antagonists are competitive inhibitors at this receptor site. H <sub>1 </sub> \\-receptor antagonists are frequently used for the treatment of allergic rhinitis, urticaria, and hives. Some are used as prophylaxis for motion sickness and as sleep aids. Older, first-generation, antihistamines cross the blood-brain barrier, contributing to their potentially use-limiting side effect of sedation and can also have significant anticholinergic effects (dry mouth, dry eyes, blurred vision, urinary retention). They must be used with caution in the elderly and in combination with other sedating medications, because the effects can be additive. Newer, second-generation antihistamines have significantly less penetration into the CNS and reduced anticholinergic activity. This results in a lower incidence of sedation and fewer anticholinergic side effects. H <sub>2 </sub> \\-receptor activity is coupled to increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Activation of H <sub>2 </sub> receptors in gastric parietal cells causes an increase in gastric acid production. Medications that are competitive antagonists of H <sub>2 </sub> receptors are used to reduce gastric acid secretion. These are used clinically in the management of peptic ulcer disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, heartburn, and acid hypersecretory syndromes.\n\n【13】APPROACH TO:\n\n【14】Pharmacology of Histamine and Antihistamines\n\n【15】#### OBJECTIVES\n\n【16】1\\. Know the synthesis and mechanism of action of histamine.\n\n【17】2\\. Know the mechanism of action, uses, and adverse effects of antihistamine medications.\n\n【18】3\\. Understand the biology and pharmacology of the histamine receptors.\n\n【19】#### DEFINITIONS\n\n【20】Allergic rhinitis: An antigen-mediated allergic reaction that causes nasal congestion, sneezing, itchy eyes, and bronchoconstriction; also called hay fever.\n\n【21】#### DISCUSSION\n\n【22】##### Class\n\n【23】Histamine, β-aminoethylimidazole, is formed in many tissues by decarboxylation of the amino acid L \\-histidine by the enzyme histidine decarboxylase. Mast cells and basophils are the principal histamine-containing cells in most tissues. Histamine is stored in vesicles in a complex with heparin and is released by either an immunologic trigger or following a mechanical or chemical stimulus. Once released, histamine produces a number of responses including local vasodilation, transudation of fluid through endothelial cells, and stimulation of nerve endings, producing pain and itching. In the lung, histamine is a bronchoconstrictor, and this action is magnified in patients with asthma. Histamine has actions in the GI tract and causes contraction of smooth muscle; it is also a potent secretagogue for gastric acid secretion, pepsin, and intrinsic factor. In the brain, histamine acts as a neurotransmitter.\n\n【24】The actions of histamine are mediated by four distinct membrane receptors that are coupled to G-proteins. The H <sub>1 </sub> receptor, located in smooth muscle cells, endothelium, and brain, is coupled to increased diacylglycerol and Ca <sup>2+ </sup> release. The H <sub>2 </sub> receptor is located in gastric mucosa mast cells, immune cells, and brain, and is coupled to increased cAMP. There is no clinical pharmacology yet for H <sub>3 </sub> (located in the brain and peripheral neurons) or H <sub>4 </sub> (found on eosinophils and neutrophils) receptors, but both of these receptors are targets for therapeutic agents and are under intense investigation. Histamine itself has a variety of untoward effects and is useful only diagnostically to assess bronchial hyperreactivity.\n\n【25】Antihistamines Compounds that block the active state of histamine H <sub>1 </sub> receptors have been used for years and are widely marketed both as prescription and over-the-counter medications. The current group of available drugs can be divided into first-generation and second-generation agents. In general, first-generation agents can cross the blood-brain barrier, and they have a number of effects in the brain, including sedation and reduction of nausea. Table 24–1 lists some currently used H <sub>1 </sub> antagonists.\n删除4：<u>Table 24–1 • CURRENTLY AVAILABLE ANTIHISTAMINES</u>\n\n【26】All of these drugs block the action of H <sub>1 </sub> receptors, and they do not possess significant affinity for the H <sub>2 </sub> receptor. However, many of the first-generation agents have significant anticholinergic activity, and this is responsible for a significant degree of their central effects. Second-generation agents are less lipid soluble and do not penetrate the blood-brain barrier and hence have many fewer central adverse effects.\n\n【27】The major use of H <sub>1 </sub> \\-receptor blockers is in the treatment of allergic reactions. Histamine is released by IgE-sensitized cells, especially mast cells, and antihistamines can reduce the rhinitis, conjunctivitis, sneezing, and urticaria associated with this reaction. They are most effective in acute allergic reactions with a relatively low antigen burden, and effectiveness diminishes in chronic disorders. Antihistamines are not effective as monotherapy for bronchial asthma. Antihistamines are marketed for treatment of the common cold, but they have very limited effectiveness in this application and their adverse effects (eg, sedation) outweigh their benefit. Some of the first-generation agents, especially dimenhydrinate, meclizine, cyclizine, and promethazine, are useful for the prophylaxis of motion sickness and vertigo. Promethazine is the most potent in this regard but has pronounced sedative activity that limits its usefulness. The sedating action of some antihistamines has been exploited in their use as sleeping aids.\n\n【28】Diphenhydramine is the most commonly used antihistamine in sleeping preparations. The major adverse effect of the first-generation agents is sedation. The anticholinergic activity produces atropine-like effects including dry mouth, urinary retention, and cough. Second-generation agents avoid these effects but do have adverse effects such as headache and back pain, and in the GI tract cause nausea, loss of appetite, and constipation or diarrhea. Of the presently available second-generation antihistamines, cetirizine causes the highest incidence of fatigue and somnolence (approximately 10%); loratadine and desloratadine appear to have the lowest incidence of this effect (approximately 1–3%). Desloratadine is unique among antihistamines in reducing nasal congestion.\n\n【29】These agents may produce cardiovascular adverse effects such as hypotension, bradycardia or tachycardia, and electrocardiograph (ECG) changes.\n\n【30】##### Administration\n\n【31】All of the agents listed in Table 24–1 are available for oral use, and some of the first-generation agents are available for parenteral use. Topical application of diphenhydramine is useful in the treatment of minor allergic dermatologic reactions. Azelastine is administered by nasal spray.\n\n【32】##### Pharmacokinetics\n\n【33】Following oral administration, the H <sub>1 </sub> antagonists reach peak levels in about 2–3 hours and last 6–24 hours depending on the agent.\n\n【34】##### H <sub>2 </sub> Receptor Antagonists\n\n【35】Histamine is a potent gastric acid secretagogue and this action is mediated by histamine H <sub>2 </sub> receptors. Cimetidine, ranitidine, nizatidine, and famotidine are H <sub>2 </sub> \\-specific antagonists and are used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease and peptic ulcers. Adverse effects include hypotension, headache, and diarrhea. Cimetidine inhibits many P450 enzymes and by this mechanism causes drug interactions.\n\n【36】####",

        "text": "【0】Question: A 16-year-old pregnant girl has not received prenatal care. At 17 weeks, she noted some painless vaginal spotting (bleeding) which prompted her to seek medical attention. On arrival at the hospital, pelvic examination showed fetal parts in the cervical os and the patient was told that a miscarriage was inevitable. The products of conception as delivered are shown in the image. What is the most likely pathogenesis of this condition?\n删除个例：<u>> Reproduced, with permission, from USMLERx.com.</u>\n> (A) Ethanol toxicity\n\n【1】> (B) Malrotation\n\n【2】> (C) Maternal folate deficiency\n\n【3】> (D) Omphalomesenteric vessel occlusion\n\n【4】> (E) ToRCHeS infection\n\n【5】 Answer: The correct answer is B. The patient has an omphalocele, which results from failure of closure of the anterior abdominal wall. In this midline abdominal wall defect, the herniated viscera are covered by a membrane consisting of the amniotic membranes, Wharton jelly, and peritoneum. Between 50% and 70% of children with omphalocele have additional congenital anomalies (including cardiac defects and genitourinary malformations such as bladder exstrophy), which are also thought to be related to ventral closure defects. The pathogenesis of omphalocele is believed to be sporadic defective closure of the abdominal wall secondary to malrotation of the midgut derivatives during the 10th week of embryonic development. Alternative theories include abnormal persistence of the primitive body stalk and the failure of body wall closure secondary to incomplete lateral body wall migration. The incidence of omphalocele is 1:5000 live births, and it is most commonly associated with extremes of maternal age (<20 or >40 years of age). It may be associated with a chromosomal abnormality if there is only herniation of the small bowel or the liver.  \nAnswer A is incorrect. Ethanol toxicity is not associated with abdominal wall defects. Ethanol exposure during embryogenesis is associated with fetal alcohol syndrome, which includes mental retardation and a typical facies characterized by a smooth philtrum, thin upper lip, and small palpebral fissures.  \nAnswer C is incorrect. Maternal folate deficiency is not associated with abdominal wall defects. Folate deficiency has been associated with a number of neural tube defects, including anencephaly and spina bifida. A myelomeningocele would be located at the posterior side (superior if using fetal terminology).  \nAnswer D is incorrect. Omphalomesenteric vessel occlusion and consequent ischemia is believed to be the cause of gastroschisis, another congenital abdominal wall defect. This condition is a full-thickness defect in the abdominal wall, and there is no protective membrane with a variable amount of herniation of the intestines and parts of other abdominal organs. Unlike omphalocele, gastroschisis herniation occurs to the right of the umbilicus, and is rarely associated with other congenital anomalies. Children with this defect should be given a warm moist occlusive dressing and receive immediate surgical intervention.  \nAnswer E is incorrect. The ToRCHeS infections include T oxoplasmosis, R ubella, C ytomegalovirus (CMV), H erpesvirus/HIV, and S yphilis. Congenital infection with one of the ToRCHeS viruses is not associated with abdominal wall defects. Instead, common manifestations include fevers, hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, poor feeding, and intrauterine growth restriction. Other specific signs include chorioretinitis, cataracts, and neural deafness (rubella); intracranial calcifications (toxoplasmosis); rhinitis, “blueberry-muffin” skin lesions, and interstitial keratitis (syphilis); cerebral calcifications (CMV); and vesicular skin lesions (herpes simplex virus).",

        "text": "【0】Question: 26.1 A 14-year-old girl has a 1-week history of arthritis involving her hands, wrists, knees, and ankles. At the onset she had noted that her cheeks seemed flushed; this resolved and has been followed by a slightly pruritic red macular rash over her torso and proximal extremities that is now clearing in some areas. On review of systems, she reports rhinorrhea and a low-grade fever 2 weeks ago. On examination, she has tender swelling of the aforementioned joints and an erythematous macular rash with a reticular pattern. Which of the following findings would help identify the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【1】A. Positive rheumatoid factor\n\n【2】B. Reticulocyte count of 0%\n\n【3】C. Anemia\n\n【4】D. Skin biopsy of the rash\n\n【5】E. Synovial fluid analysis\n\n【6】Answer: 26.1 B. The differential diagnosis for childhood arthritis includes infectious and rheumatologic disorders. Her symptoms and physical examination findings are typical of parvovirus B19 infection. Patients with this infection can have a transiently positive RF and often will have mild anemia. Parvovirus B19 targets erythroid precursors; there is no compensatory reticulocytosis as these are lysed by the virus. The other studies would not be helpful in distinguishing the etiology of the arthritis.\n\n【7】Question: 26.2 A 5-year-old girl is referred to a pediatric rheumatologist with a 4-week history of mild swelling and decreased range of motion in the left knee and right elbow. She is afebrile and appears otherwise well. Positive findings on which of the following evaluations will be most helpful in establishing her diagnosis?\n\n【8】A. Arthrocentesis\n\n【9】B. Complete blood count\n\n【10】C. Computerized tomographic scan of the involved joints\n\n【11】D. Slit-lamp examination of her eyes\n\n【12】E. Bone scan\n\n【13】Answer: 26.2 D. JIA is the most common cause of uveitis in children. Uveitis onset may be insidious, and may be the only initial manifestation of JIA. The disease is more common in young girls. Slit-lamp findings include band keratopathy, posterior synechiae, and cataracts. Children with JIA should have periodic slit-lamp examinations in order to detect eye disease early. Consideration may be given to obtaining the tests suggested in the other answer choices, but positive results on these tests are unlikely to be specific for JIA.\n\n【14】Question: 26.3 A 6-year-old boy presents with his mother after developing acute right groin and knee pain that causes him to limp. He and the mother do not recall any trauma. Review of systems is positive only for rhinorrhea and sore throat 2 weeks ago. On examination, he is afebrile and his knee exam is normal, but he walks with a right toe-touch gait. Which of the following are the most appropriate next steps in his evaluation?\n\n【15】A. Assess range of motion of the right hip; measure WBC and ESR; perform ultrasound of the right hip.\n\n【16】B. Perform ophthalmologic exam; measure ANA and RF; perform x-ray of the knee.\n\n【17】C. Perform a full skin exam; interview the child alone about abuse; perform a skeletal survey.\n\n【18】D. Ask the mother about bleeding disorders; measure coagulation factors; perform aspiration of the knee.\n\n【19】E. Interview the child and mother about recent school stressors; provide reassurance to the mother that he is exaggerating growing pains for secondary gain; refer to counseling services.\n\n【20】Answer: 26.3 A. A good rule of thumb is to examine one joint above and one joint below the site of symptoms. Hip pain may refer to the groin, anterior thigh, or knee. If the hip’s range of motion is near-normal, WBC and ESR are normal, and ultrasound shows a joint effusion, the most likely diagnosis is transient (toxic) synovitis of the hip.\n\n【21】Question: 26.4 A 3-year-old boy with suspected systemic-onset JIA develops tachycardia and dyspnea on the fifth hospital day. He complains that his chest hurts. Heart auscultation reveals a “friction rub” sound. Which of the following is the next best step in management?\n\n【22】A. Give him a nebulized albuterol treatment.\n\n【23】B. Give him a dose of furosemide.\n\n【24】C. Give him some acetaminophen.\n\n【25】D. Check his oxygenation status through pulse oximetry, obtain a stat electrocardiogram, and consult with a pediatric cardiologist.\n\n【26】E. Check his oxygenation status via pulse oximetry, obtain a stat chest x-ray, and initiate intravenous antibiotics.\nAnswer: 26.4 D. A friction rub is characteristic of pericarditis, which is a common and serious complication of systemic-onset JIA. The friction rub is a “grating” or “creaking” sound that often is best heard along the left sternal border. Patients typically complain of chest pain that is relieved when the patient is asked to lean forward, and worsened by deep inspiration or coughing; however, pain is not always present. Rarely, pericarditis in JIA may precede the development of arthritis by months or even years. Low-voltage QRS complexes and ST-segment elevation may be seen on the electrocardiogram. Treatment consists of salicylates or steroids.\n\n【27】CLINICAL PEARLS\n\n【28】 The spectrum of juvenile idiopathic arthritis comprises three entities: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> systemic-onset disease, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> polyarticular disease, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> oligoarticular disease.\n\n【29】 Systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis is an important consideration in the differential diagnosis of childhood fever of unknown origin.\n\n【30】 The diagnosis of juvenile idiopathic arthritis is based on clinical criteria and by the exclusion of other possibilities; no single laboratory test confirms the diagnosis.\n\n【31】#",

        "text": "【0】Question: A 68-year-old man with a six-month history of back pain and fatigue presents to the emergency department because of severe low back pain. MRI shows multiple lytic bone lesions scattered throughout the man’s body, and laboratory results show a serum M spike and light chain proteinuria. Bone marrow biopsy demonstrates an excessive number of the cells shown in the image. Which of the following is most likely to be present in these cells?\n删除个例：<u>> Reproduced, with permission, from USMLERx.com.</u>\n> (A) Abundant mitochondria\n\n【1】> (B) Abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum\n\n【2】> (C) Abundant secondary lysosomes\n\n【3】> (D) Abundant smooth endoplasmic reticulum\n Answer: The correct answer is B . This patient has multiple myeloma, a neoplastic proliferation of plasma cells in the bone marrow that often leads to lytic bone lesions and pathological fractures. The plasma cell is a differentiated B lymphocyte that can produce and secrete large amounts of antibody specific to a particular antigen. Rough endoplasmic reticulum is the site of synthesis of secretory proteins; thus antibody-secreting plasma cells are rich in RER. Normally there is a polyclonal distribution of immunoglobulins of different isotypes and antigen specificities in the serum. In multiple myeloma, however, the majority of plasma cells are producing immunoglobulin of one isotype and antigen specifically, which can be detected as an M spike by serum protein electrophoresis. The free light chains (either kappa or lambda) can often be detected in the urine; this is referred to as Bence-Jones proteinuria. Patients with multiple myeloma might also manifest anemia, increased susceptibility to infection, or clotting abnormalities secondary to the reduced production of normal blood components.  \nAnswer A is incorrect . The primary function of mitochondria is the synthesis of ATP. They are abundant in cells that require a large amount of energy, such as myocytes.  \nAnswer C is incorrect . Secondary lysosomes are formed when a primary lysosome, with its hydrolytic enzymes, fuses with materials for degradation. Secondary lysosomes have substrates at different stages of digestion. Cells such as macrophages, which are responsible for phagocytosis of cell debris, may contain multiple secondary lysosomes.  \nAnswer D is incorrect . Smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) is the site of steroid synthesis and detoxification of drugs and poisons; thus, cells like hepatocytes and steroid-producing cells of the adrenal cortex are rich in SER.  \nAnswer E is incorrect . Areas of rough endoplasmic reticulum in neurons are called Nissl bodies. This is the site of enzyme and peptide neurotransmitter synthesis.",

The mother reports the patient has always been healthy and has no significant medical history, but she has lost 20 lb recently without trying and has been complaining of fatigue for 2 or 3 weeks. The patient had attributed the fatigue to sleep disturbance, as recently she has been getting up several times at night to urinate. This morning, the mother found the patient in her room, complaining of abdominal pain, and she had vomited. She appeared confused and did not know that today was a school day.\n\n【3】On examination, the patient is slender, lying on a stretcher with eyes closed, but she is responsive to questions. She is afebrile, and has a heart rate 118 bpm, blood pressure 125/84 mm Hg, with deep and rapid respirations at the rate of 24 breaths per minute. Upon standing, her heart rate rises to 145 bpm, and her blood pressure falls to 110/80 mm Hg. Her funduscopic examination is normal, her oral mucosa is dry, and her neck veins are flat. Her chest is clear to auscultation, and her heart is tachycardic with a regular rhythm and no murmur. Her abdomen is soft with active bowel sounds and mild diffuse tenderness, but no guarding or rebound. Her neurologic examination reveals no focal deficits.\n\n【4】Laboratory studies include serum Na 131 mEq/L, K 5.3 mEq/L, Cl 95 mEq/L, CO <sub>2 </sub> 9 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 35 mg/dL, creatinine 1.3 mg/dL, and glucose 475 mg/dL. Arterial blood gas reveals pH 7.12 with PCO <sub>2 </sub> 24 mm Hg and PO <sub>2 </sub> 95 mm Hg. Urine drug screen and urine pregnancy test are negative, and urinalysis shows no hematuria or pyuria, but 3+ glucose and 3+ ketones. Chest radiograph is read as normal, and plain film of the abdomen has nonspecific gas pattern but no signs of obstruction.\n\n【5】 What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【6】 What is your next step?\n\n【7】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【8】#### Suspected Diabetic Ketoacidosis\n\n【9】#### DEFINITIONS\n\n【10】DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS: A syndrome of hyperglycemia, anion gap metabolic acidosis, and ketone bodies in the serum, caused by insufficient insulin levels.\n\n【11】KUSSMAUL RESPIRATIONS: Deep and rapid breathing; represent hyperventilation in an attempt to generate a respiratory alkalosis to compensate for the metabolic acidosis.\n\n【12】#### CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【13】Diabetic ketoacidosis is a clinical syndrome that results when the triad of anion gap metabolic acidosis, hyperglycemia, and ketosis is present and is caused by a significant insulin deficiency. It is a medical emergency, with an overall mortality rate less than 5% if patients receive prompt and appropriate medical treatment. The majority of episodes are preventable, and many of the deaths also are preventable with proper attention to detail during management.\n\n【14】##### Pathophysiology\n\n【15】In the normal physiologic state, there is a fine balance between anabolic and catabolic hormones. In the fed state, anabolic actions of insulin predominate. Glycogenesis, lipogenesis, and protein synthesis all are increased. This results in storage of energy reserves in the form of triglycerides and glycogen.\n\n【16】In the fasting state, insulin serves to inhibit lipolysis, ketogenesis, gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis, and proteolysis. These effects are critical in controlling the rate of breakdown of energy stores under the influence of catabolic hormones. Glucagon is the most important catabolic hormone. In the fasting state, it maintains normal glucose levels by stimulating hepatic gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis.\n\n【17】Diabetes is the condition of relative or absolute insulin deficiency. When there is a severe insulin deficiency and a relative excess of glucagon, lipolysis is enhanced, causing release of free fatty acids. Oxidation of the fatty acids produces ketones, such as acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate, which are organic acids and often referred to as ketoacids . The excess of these ketoacids can produce a life-threatening metabolic acidosis. In addition, hyperglycemia produces an osmotic diuresis, which causes severe volume depletion, and electrolyte deficiencies by washing extracellular sodium, potassium, magnesium, phosphate, and water out of the body. The combination of acidosis, hypovolemia, and electrolyte deficiencies can lead to cardiovascular collapse, the most common cause of death in DKA .\n\n【18】##### Clinical Presentation\n\n【19】Patients with diabetes have an underlying impairment in glucose metabolism and, when challenged by a stress, an increase in insulin requirements. If they are unable to meet these insulin requirements, DKA may result. The most common precipitating events are infections such as pneumonia or urinary tract infection, vascular disorders such as myocardial infarction, or other stressors such as trauma. Diabetic ketoacidosis may be the presentation of new-onset diabetes, or it can occur in patients with established diabetes because of failure to use insulin for whatever reason or because of use of other medications (eg, glucocorticoids) that interfere with insulin action.\n\n【20】An episode of DKA evolves over a short period of time, typically less than 24 hours. The patient with DKA has the signs and symptoms of hyperglycemia, acidosis, and dehydration. Polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, visual blurring, and decreased mental status are related to hyperglycemia and osmotic diuresis. Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, malaise, and shortness of breath may be related to the acidosis.\n\n【21】Typical signs include reduced skin elasticity, dry mucous membranes, hypotension, and tachycardia related to volume depletion. Kussmaul respirations , deep and rapid breathing, represent hyperventilation in an attempt to generate a respiratory alkalosis to compensate for the metabolic acidosis. One may also note the fruity breath odor typical of ketosis.\n\n【22】##### Laboratory Diagnosis\n\n【23】Laboratory values show hyperglycemia (usually >250 mg/dL), acidosis (pH <7.3), anion gap (usually >15 mmol/L), and ketonemia. The most important laboratory parameters are the degree of acidosis, the anion gap, and the serum potassium level.\n\n【24】Patients with a very low pH (<7.0) are severely acidotic and have a worse prognosis. The lower pH is a result of the higher concentration of ketoacids, which are estimated using the anion gap. The first step in evaluating any patient with metabolic acidosis should be calculation of the anion gap . This concept is based on the principle of electrical neutrality, that is, all the cations must equal all the anions. The anion gap estimates those negatively charged particles that are not routinely measured and can be calculated using the following calculation:\n\n【25】The normal anion gap is 10 to 12 mmol/L. When it is elevated, there is an excess of unmeasured anions, which typically occurs because of one of the four causes, which are listed in Table 43–1 .\n\n【26】Lactic acidosis can be a result of severe tissue hypoxia, as in septic shock or carbon monoxide poisoning, or a result of hepatic failure and subsequent inability to metabolize lactate. Ketoacidosis most commonly occurs as an acute complication of uncontrolled diabetes, but it also can be seen in starvation and alcoholism (discussed later). The ingested toxins may be organic acids themselves, such as salicylic acid, or have acidic metabolites, such as formic acid from methanol. Renal failure leads to an inability to excrete organic acids as well as inorganic acids such as phosphates (often without an anion gap).\n删除4：<u>Table 43–1 • CAUSES OF HIGH ANION CAP METABOLIC ACIDOSIS</u>\n\n【27】Lactic acidosis\n\n【28】Ketoacidosis\n\n【29】• Diabetic\n\n【30】• Alcoholic\n\n【31】• Starvation\n\n【32】Toxins\n\n【33】• Ethylene glycol\n\n【34】• Methanol\n\n【35】• Salicylates\n\n【36】通用删除2(英):<u>Renal failure (acute or chronic) 删除换行1 删除10：<u>(Reproduced, with permission, from DuBose TD. Acidosis and alkalosis. In: Braunwald E, Fauci AS, Kasper KL, et al. eds . Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine. 16th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; 2005:265.)</u></u>\n\n【37】In patients with DKA, total body potassium stores are depleted because of urinary losses, and potassium replacement will always be necessary. Initially, the measured serum potassium levels may be high despite the total body potassium deficit because of acidosis resulting in movement of potassium from the intracellular to the extracellular compartment. As the acidosis is corrected and with the administration of insulin, which drives potassium intracellularly, serum potassium levels will fall rapidly .\n\n【38】The serum sodium level can be variable. Hyperglycemia causes water to move extracellularly, which can lead to hyponatremia. Similarly, phosphate levels can be variable in the presence of body store deficits with the extracellular movement of phosphate caused by catabolic state. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are elevated, reflecting dehydration. Serum acetoacetate may cause a false elevation in serum creatinine level because of interference with the assay.\n\n【39】##### Management\n\n【40】The goal of treatment is restoration of metabolic homeostasis with correction of precipitating events and biochemical deficits, which consists of the following:\n\n【41】1\\. Replacement of fluid losses with improvement of circulatory volume\n\n【42】2\\. Correction of hyperglycemia and, in turn, plasma osmolality\n\n【43】3\\. Replacement of electrolyte losses\n\n【44】4\\. Clearance of serum ketones\n\n【45】5\\. Identification and treatment of precipitating cause and complications\n\n【46】Close monitoring of the patient is important. A flow sheet recording vital signs, input and output, insulin dosage, and metabolic progress is important. Serum glucose concentration should be measured every 1 hour, and levels of serum electrolytes and phosphate must be assessed every 3 to 5 hours. Urinalysis, urine and blood cultures, ECG, and chest x-ray should be obtained to identify precipitating factors and complications. Other investigations should be pursued as symptoms and signs warrant.\n\n【47】##### Fluids\n\n【48】All patients with DKA are volume depleted as a consequence of osmotic diuresis as well as from other ongoing losses, such as vomiting. Hydration improves renal perfusion and cardiac output, facilitating glucose excretion. Rehydration may also diminish insulin resistance by decreasing levels of counterregulatory hormones and hyperglycemia. Sudden reduction in hyperglycemia can lead to vascular collapse with shift of water intracellularly. To avoid this, initial replacement fluid should be isotonic normal saline (NS) to correct circulatory volume deficit. Over the first hour, 1 to 2 L of NS should be infused. Following this, total body water deficit is corrected at the rate of 250 to 500 mL/h, depending on the state of hydration. The composition of fluid should be tailored according to serum sodium and chloride measurements.\n\n【49】Hydration should be gentler in patients with congestive heart failure or end-stage renal disease because such patients can easily get fluid overload.\n\n【50】##### Insulin\n\n【51】The goal of therapy is a glucose reduction of 80 to 100 mg/dL/h. Use of continuous low-dose intravenous infusion of insulin is recommended because it reduces episodes of hypoglycemia and hypokalemia, and it allows a more controlled reduction of serum glucose and osmolality. Intramuscular and subcutaneous routes can be used if tissue perfusion is adequate.\n\n【52】Insulin treatment may be initiated as an intravenous bolus of 0.1 to 0.15 U/kg. This should be followed by a continuous infusion of 0.1 U/kg/h with hourly serum glucose determinations . If blood glucose fails to decline at the desired rate, volume status should be reassessed, and insulin infusion should be titrated. The rate of infusion should be decreased to 0.05 U/kg/h when the blood glucose level decreases to 250 to 300 mg/dL. Glucose levels fall more quickly than ketosis resolves. Insulin is necessary for resolution of the ketoacidosis and can be coad-ministered with a glucose infusion until the anion gap is resolved. A 5% to 10% dextrose solution should be added to the hydrating solution when plasma glucose is less than 300 mg/dL. One can judge the resolution of ketoacidosis when the bicarbonate is more than 18 mEq/L, the anion gap is less than 12, the patient feels better, and the vital signs are stabilized. Serial determination of serum ketone levels is not clinically useful in measuring response to therapy. Laboratory tests measure acetoacetate and acetone, but not beta-hydroxybutyrate. With the administration of insulin, betahydroxybutyrate is first oxidized to acetoacetate, so measured ketone levels may actually increase with effective therapy. Instead, one should be guided by normalizing the anion gap when making decisions about the rate of insulin infusion. Subcutaneous insulin should be given approximately 30 minutes before stopping insulin infusion to avoid rebound acidosis.\n\n【53】##### Bicarbonate\n\n【54】Bicarbonate therapy is controversial and should not be given to ketoacidotic patients unless their arterial pH is less than 7.0 or other indications, such as cardiac instability or severe hyperkalemia, are present. Bicarbonate therapy can cause worsening hypokalemia, paradoxical central nervous system acidosis, and delay in ketone clearance.\n\n【55】##### Electrolytes\n\n【56】In DKA, there is deficit of total body potassium, phosphate, and magnesium . Patients frequently have hyperkalemia as a result of acidosis, insulin deficiency, and hypertonicity that cause a shift of potassium extracellularly. During treatment, plasma potassium concentration will fall as the metabolic abnormalities are corrected. Potassium should be added to initial intravenous fluids once the concentration is less than 5 mEq/L. Once adequate urine output is established, 20 to 40 mEq of potassium should be added to each liter of fluid. The goal is to maintain potassium in the range of 4 to 5 mEq/L. Cardiac monitoring is recommended in the presence of hypokalemia or hyperkalemia.\n\n【57】Phosphate replacement should be given to patients with serum phosphate concentrations less than 1 mg/dL and to patients with moderate hypophosphatemia with concomitant hypoxia, anemia, or cardiorespiratory compromise. Careful monitoring of the serum calcium level is necessary with phosphate administration.\n\n【58】Magnesium and calcium can be supplemented as needed.\n\n【59】##### Precipitating Causes\n\n【60】It is important to correct precipitating factors in order to restore metabolic balance. Identifiable sources of infection should be treated aggressively. Possible presence of ischemia and infarction should be evaluated and treated appropriately with help from specialists as needed.\n\n【61】##### Complications\n\n【62】Cerebral edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome, thromboembolism, fluid overload, and acute gastric dilatation are rare, but serious, complications of DKA.\n\n【63】##### Prevention\n\n【64】The major precipitating factors in the development of DKA are inadequate insulin treatment and infection. These events can be prevented by patient education and effective communication with a health-care team. Sick-day management regarding dosing of insulin, blood glucose monitoring, avoiding prolonged fasting, and preventing dehydration should be addressed. Socioeconomic barriers contribute to the high rates of admission for DKA. Appropriate allocation of health-care resources toward preventive strategies is needed.\n\n【65】Other metabolic complications of deranged carbohydrate metabolism deserve mention at this point. The first is hyperosmolar nonketotic diabetic coma . This condition occurs mainly in patients with type 2 diabetes who become profoundly dehydrated because of osmotic diuresis. However, these patients have sufficient insulin action to prevent the development of ketoacidosis. They may present with glucose levels more than 1000 mg/dL, serum osmolarity more than 320 to 370 Osm, and neurologic symptoms ranging from confusion to seizures to coma. Compared to patients with DKA, they have a much larger fluid deficit, and therapy is primarily volume resuscitation with NS. Insulin is also used to reverse hyperglycemia but usually is given in lesser doses than is required for clearance of ketosis in DKA.\n\n【66】Alcoholic ketoacidosis develops in chronic alcoholics who are malnourished and have depleted glycogen stores, and is often seen in the setting of binge drinking, which may shift the ratio of the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), inhibiting gluconeogenesis. They develop an anion gap metabolic acidosis as a result of ketoacidosis and lactic acidosis. They present with the same symptoms of acidosis as do DKA patients, for example, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, but with low, normal, or slightly elevated glucose levels (in contrast to DKA, in which the glucose level usually is markedly elevated). Treatment is administration of volume in the form of NS and glucose solution. Insulin administration typically is unnecessary.\n\n【67】####",

The company would like to market the drug and is conducting a study to look at its benefits and possible risks. In coordination with a physician at a local hospital, it enrolls 800 people for the study. The physician places 100 patients with the worst and most frequent migraines in the medication group, as he thinks that they are in most need of the drug’s benefit.

Selection bias is being displayed in this scenario. The physician is selecting his more serious cases for the treatment group (ie, those who are in most need of the benefit). The placebo group contains patients who are healthier, less symptomatic, and more likely to have a better outcome. Therefore, when it comes time for collecting data, the drug’s beneficial effect compared to placebo may be blunted.  \nAnswer A is incorrect . Studies can still be valid if there are differences in group size. There is no evidence that there is a difference in group size in this scenario.  \nAnswer B is incorrect . Late-look bias occurs when information or results are gathered at an inappropriate time. Late-look bias is not displayed in this scenario.  \nAnswer C is incorrect . Recall bias occurs when knowledge of the presence of a disorder alters the way a subject remembers his or her history. For example, patients may over- or underestimate their consumption of a certain drug upon learning of its detrimental effect on the body. Recall bias is not displayed in this scenario.  \nAnswer D is incorrect . Sampling bias occurs when those in the trial are not truly representative of the general population. Therefore, the results (both positive and negative) of the study cannot be truly applied to the general population. There is no evidence of sampling bias in this scenario.",

A Case of Insect Immunity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>\n===========================================================\n\n【2】Introduction\n------------\n\n【3】Your immune system is made up of two parts that work together to limit the damage caused when a foreign cell, virus, or other pathogen enters your body. The innate immune system is your first line of defense. It is made up of a class of cells called leukocytes (neutrophils, macrophages, and mast cells) that control infections by physically removing the invading pathogen through the process of phagocytosis . Should the infection overwhelm the leukocytes, a different class of immune cells, the lymphocytes (B cells and T cells), will become activated. Lymphocytes are part of the adaptive immune system .\n\n【4】The adaptive immune system functions differently than the innate immune system. One way the adaptive immune system is different, is the ability of the lymphocytes to produce antibody proteins . Antibody proteins recognize and bind with high specificity to antigens on the surface of foreign cells. The molecules that make up the surface features of a cell (proteins, glycoproteins, polysaccharides, etc.) are all potential antigens. Antibodies bind to specific antigens. Antibodies act as a kind of cellular “red flag,” which signals other immune cells to remove the pathogen either by phagocytosis or cell-mediated killing. This means that only cells carrying that antigen will be targeted for destruction. Another important difference is the ability of the cells of the adaptive immune system to remember. The ability of the immune system to “remember” previous encounters with pathogens means that the immune response to subsequent exposures can occur more quickly and more efficiently, saving the organism from damage or disease.\n\n【5】For humans, vaccinations (immunizations) provide protection from diseases by introducing nonlethal versions of a pathogen to an individual’s immune system. Let us use the example of a vaccination against influenza virus (the flu). Your body reacts to the presence of the injected flu virus as if it were capable of causing the disease. Lymphocytes that can produce antibodies specific to the surface antigens of the virus are activated and will begin to remove the virus from your body. A subpopulation of these activated lymphocytes will not participate in the removal of the virus. Instead, these cells are stored in your body as memory cells . Later, if you again get exposed to the actual flu virus, these memory cells will rapidly produce the antibodies needed to quickly target and destroy the virus, protecting you from getting sick.\n\n【6】Although it is easy to think of this sophisticated type of immune response as an exclusive feature of higher animals like humans, the pathogens of the world do not discriminate between phyla. However, controversy exists as to whether invertebrates possess a type of adaptive immune system that provides the same specificity and long-term protection that are the hallmarks of your immune system.\n\n【7】▪ What happens to a bacterial cell after it is internalized by a macrophage through the process of phagocytosis?\n\n【8】▪ How can an antibody protein “recognize” and bind specifically to a particular antigen?\n\n【9】▪ Outline the roles and relationships between each of the following cells in the adaptive immune response: dendritic cells, T helper cells, cytotoxic T cells, B cells, plasma cells, and memory cells.\n\n【10】▪ Propose an explanation for why you need annual flu vaccines, but not annual polio vaccines.\n\n【11】Background\n----------\n\n【12】Bumblebees ( Bombus terrestris ) are social insects that live in colonies. This means that bees are in constant, close proximity to other bees and are therefore exposed to any pathogens carried by other members of the colony. Pathogens known to infect bees include the Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens and the Gram-positive bacteria Paenibacillus alvei and Paenibacillus larvae. In a high concentration, these pathogens are capable of killing the bees.\n\n【13】Bumblebees, like other insects, have an open circulatory system , which transports hemolymph through the bee’s body, where it can come into direct contact with tissues and any invading pathogens. In addition to the oxygen-carrying molecule hemocyanin, hemolymph contains proteins and cells called granulocytes and plasmatocytes that function as part of an innate immune response by encapsulating, phagocytosing, and killing pathogens. Insects are not known to produce antibodies. The following experiment sought to determine whether prior exposure to a pathogen provided specific, long-term protection in bumblebees.\n\n【14】▪ What types of antigens might be present on the surface of a bacterium?\n\n【15】▪ How would the surface features of a bacterium vary if it is Gram-negative versus Gram-positive?\n\n【16】▪ Outline the steps involved in phagocytosis of a pathogen.\n\n【17】▪ Would it be possible for an organism to have an adaptive immune response in the absence of antibodies? Explain your answer.\n\n【18】Methods\n-------\n\n【19】### Insects\n\n【20】All animals used in this study were of the species B. terrestris . Worker bumblebees were obtained from healthy colonies set up from queens collected in northwestern Switzerland in the spring of 2005. Immature workers were removed from the colony, maintained in isolation, and randomly assigned to one of the experimental groups 5 days after emergence from their pupal case. For each experiment, treatments were fully repeated in each of the colonies used. All colonies and individual bees were kept at 28 ± 2°C under red light with pollen and sugar water provided ad libitum. All injections took place between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. and treatments carried out on a particular day were randomly assigned.\n\n【21】### Bacteria\n\n【22】P. fluorescens 删除10：<u>(DSM 50090)</u>, P. alvei (DSM 29), and P. larvae 删除10：<u>(DSM3615)</u> were used. These bacteria were cultured in the appropriate media at 30°C prior to use. Immediately before use, bacterial cells were washed three times in Ringer saline solution by centrifugation. Cell concentrations were determined and adjusted to the appropriate dosage level; 5 × 10 <sup>4 </sup> cells/mL for initial injections and 2.5 × 10 <sup>6 </sup> cells/mL for lethal injections. Bacterial clearance from the hemolymph was tested using an intermediate dose of 1.5 × 10 <sup>6 </sup> cells/mL. Bacteria or saline solution were injected into the abdomen of worker bees that had been anesthetized by chilling.\n\n【23】### Exposure combinations and survival\n\n【24】Individual bees received an initial dose of one of the three bacterial species or saline 5 days after emerging from their pupal case. At 8 or 22 days after initial exposure, the bees received a second higher dose injection, of one of three bacteria to achieve four possible exposure combinations. The “Ringer” group contained individuals that had previously received an injection with saline. The “heterologous” group received combinations of P. fluorescens with either P. alvei or P. larvae . The “related heterologous” group received combinations of P. alvei with P. larvae. The “homologous” group contained individuals receiving the same bacterial species twice. After the second exposure, survival was recorded every 4 h for 7 days.\n\n【25】### Exposure combinations and bacterial clearance\n\n【26】Injection combinations were carried out as described earlier, except that second bacterial challenges consisted of an intermediate dose of 1.5 × 10 <sup>6 </sup> cells/mL. Twenty four hours after second exposure, individuals were chilled on ice and all hemolymph was removed with a chilled glass microcapillary needle. The hemolymph was added to 100 μL of chilled bacterial media. The solution was further diluted by two sequential 10× dilutions. Ten microliters of each of the solutions, were spread onto plates containing agar media and incubated for 24 h. Bacterial colonies were counted and the number of bacteria per bee, was calculated taking into account the initial volume of hemolymph and the dilution factors. It was assumed that each differentiated bacterial colony originated from a single cell.\n\n【27】▪ Why were immature worker bumblebees maintained in isolation?\n\n【28】▪ What variables are being addressed in the description of the insects provided in the “Methods” section?\n\n【29】▪ Explain the difference between heterologous and related heterologous.\n\n【30】▪ Create a table/matrix outlining all the possible exposure combinations for the Ringer, heterologous, related heterologous, and homologous groups.\n\n【31】▪ Suggest a reason for using an intermediate dose of bacteria in the hemolymph clearance experiments.\n\n【32】▪ Assume 15 μL of hemolymph is collected from a bee and placed into 100 μL of bacterial media (tube 1). What volume would you need to transfer from tube 1 to tube 2 in order to make a 1:10 dilution if tube 2 contains 90 μL?\n\n【33】▪ You transfer 10 μL of media from tube 2 onto an agar plate. After a 24 h incubation you count 72 colonies on the plate. Calculate the original concentration of bacteria in the hemolymph sample in units of cells per milliliter.\n\n【34】▪ The “Methods” section of this chapter does not indicate the temperature used to incubate the hemolymph dilution plates. Based on your knowledge, what temperature would you guess would be appropriate. Justify your answer.\n\n【35】▪ Hemolymph is known to contain granulocytes and other eukaryotic cells. Predict what conditions would be required in order to grow insect cells in culture.\n\n【36】Results\n-------\n\n【37】▪ Which of the bacterial strains shown in Table 15.1.1 are the most lethal for bumblebees?\n\n【38】▪ Interpret the data for the effect of a 5 ×  10 <sup>4 </sup> cells/mL injection of P. fluorescens on the survival of a worker bumblebee.\n\n【39】▪ What biological process could account for the 0 values in the final column of Table 15.1.1 ?\n\n【40】▪ Which of the treatment groups had the highest mortality 8 days after initial exposure?\n\n【41】▪ Which of the treatment groups demonstrates the best survival 8 days after initial exposure?\n\n【42】▪ What was the purpose of injecting some individuals with Ringer saline in the first injection?\n\n【43】▪ Summarize how worker bumblebee survival changes with a 22 days lag between the first and second bacterial exposures 删除33：<u></u>.\n\n【44】▪ Estimate the proportion of bees that survived 48 h following injection with the lethal dose (2.5 ×  10 <sup>6 </sup> cells/mL) of homologous bacteria 8 and 22 days after initial, sublethal exposure. Compare your estimates with the values reported in Table 15.1.1 for single injections of each of the bacterial strains used in this case study. What can you conclude from the comparison?\n\n【45】▪ Explain what is meant by “clear hemolymph” in Figure 15.1.2 .\n\n【46】▪ Binomial distribution refers to an experiment where there are only two possible outcomes. Describe what the two outcomes are for the experiment in Figure 15.1.2 .\n\n【47】▪ Summarize the conclusion supported by the data in Figure 15.1.2 .\n\n【48】▪ Connect the data in Figure 15.1.2 to the data in Figure 15.1.1 . How are these two experiments related?\n\n【49】▪ Why is Figure 15.1.2 , a bar graph, while Figure 15.1.1 is a line graph?\n\n【50】▪ Suggest a reason the Ringer population of worker bumblebees had such a limited clearing of their hemolymph.\n\n【51】▪ Propose an explanation for why the ability of the bumblebee to “clear” a related pathogen (related heterologous) would be better than its ability to clear an unrelated pathogen (heterologous), but not as good as the response to the same pathogen (homologous)?\n\n【52】▪ The normal lifetime of a worker bumblebee is about 28 days. Based on your interpretation of the data, does prior exposure to a pathogen provide long-term and specific immune protection for bumblebees?\n\n【53】▪ Develop a hypothesis to explain the biological basis of long-term protection against pathogens observed in bumblebees.\n\n【54】▪ Propose an experiment that would test your hypothesis.\n\n【55】Table 15.1.1\n\n【56】Preliminary Results of Pathogen Exposure to Bombus terrestris Workers\n\n| Injection Type | Dose of 2 μL Injection (Cells/mL) | Proportion of Bees Surviving 24 h (±95% Confidence Interval) | Proportion of Bees Surviving 48 h (±95% Confidence Interval) | Mean Counts of Bacteria in the Hemolymph 48 h after Injection ( n \\= 12) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Ringer saline | NA | 1.0 | 1.0 | 0 |\n| Bacillus thuringiensis | 5 × 10 4 | 0.33 ± 0.13 | 0.11 ± 0.09 | – |\n|  | 2.5 × 10 | 0.11 ± 0.09 | 0 | – |\n| Serratia marcescens | 5 × 10 4 | 0 | 0 | – |\n|  | 2.5 × 10 6 | 0 | 0 | – |\n| P. fluorescens | 5 × 104 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 0 |\n|  | 2.5 × 10 6 | 0.91 ± 0.06 | 0 | – |\n| Paenibacillus alvei | 5 × 10 4 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 0 |\n|  | 2.5 × 10 6 | 0.88 ± 0.09 | 0 | – |\n| P. larvae | 5 × 10 4 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 0 |\n|  | 2.5 × 10 6 | 0.88 ± 0.09 | 0 | – |\n\n【58】A “low” dose is 5 × 10 <sup>4 </sup> cells/mL and a “high” dose is 2.5 × 10 <sup>6 </sup> cells/mL.

        "text": "【0】Question: A 32-year-old man recently underwent a liver transplant and was prescribed cyclosporine to reduce the chance of immune rejection. After a few weeks of taking the drug, he started experiencing acute pain, tenderness, warmth, and swelling of his right great toe. His physician takes a fluid sample from the affected area. Examination of the contents reveals the presence of intracellular crystals. Which of the following medications would prevent this problem from recurring?\n\n【1】> (A) Allopurinol\n\n【2】> (B) Calcitonin\n\n【3】> (C) Collagenase\n\n【4】> (D) Furosemide\n\n【5】> (E) Warfarin\n\n【6】 Answer: The correct answer is A . The main adverse reactions to cyclosporine therapy are renal dysfunction, tremor, hirsutism, hypertension, and gum hyperplasia. Cyclosporine can damage renal tubules irreversibly, thus decreasing the kidney’s ability to excrete potentially toxic metabolites. This patient is suffering from acute gouty arthritis secondary to impaired renal excretion of uric acid and thus increased serum levels of urate, which can precipitate as monosodium urate crystals in joints. Gout classically presents with a warm, red, painful joint. The most common joint affected in gout is the great toe. Other potential adverse effects of cyclosporine that occur secondary to renal failure include hyperkalemia, hypophosphatemia, hypomagnesemia, hypercalciuria, and metabolic acidosis. Allopurinol is used to prevent gouty arthritis by inhibiting xanthine oxidase, an enzyme involved in uric acid synthesis. The mainstay of therapy for acute gout is nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and corticosteroids.  \nAnswer B is incorrect . Calcitonin counteracts the action of parathyroid hormone (PTH), thus reducing serum calcium level. Whereas cyclosporine is known to cause hypercalciuria, it is not associated with the formation and precipitation of calcium pyrophosphate crystals in joints and connective tissues, also known as pseudogout. The development of pseudogout is associated with joint trauma, familial chondrocalcinosis, hemochromatosis, and certain other metabolic or endocrine disorders. Thus calcitonin would not prevent acute gouty arthritis.  \nAnswer C is incorrect . Collagenase is an enzyme involved in collagen degradation. It is key to pathogenesis of various bacteria, but it also can be induced during an immune response and lead to indirect tissue damage. Cyclosporine does not affect collagen turnover in joints. Collagenase would not counteract the effects of cyclosporine and should not lead to deposition of crystals in joint fluid.  \nAnswer D is incorrect . Furosemide is a loop diuretic used in treatment of congestive heart failure and acute renal failure. Loop diuretics may be used to increase calcium diuresis in hypercalcemic states. However, loop diuretics are known to cause hyperuricemia, which may precipitate gout in some patients and should be avoided in this patient specifically.  \nAnswer E is incorrect . Warfarin is an anticoagulant that inhibits vitamin K-dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X. Neither elevated uric acid levels nor cyclosporine itself predisposes patients to thrombus formation; therefore antithrombotic therapy is unnecessary.",

Previously he was hospitalized in another pediatric clinic where all investigations performed (laboratory tests, microbiological tests, bone marrow examination, x-rays, ultrasound scans, etc.) were negative. The family reported that the child was irritable and didn’t tolerate heat, cried with few or no tears, and seemed not to sweat. The family history was negative, the pregnancy had been normal, with physiological delivery at full term.\n\n【12】On physical examination, the child presented normal growth percentiles. His appearance was abnormal 删除33：<u></u>, his hair was sparse, eyelashes and eyebrows were absent. His skin, thin and very pale, was particularly wrinkled on the eyelids and lips. No other abnormalities were observed, in particularly the nails was normal.\n\n【13】删除3：<u>Fig. 9.1\n\n【14】Sparse scalp hair , absent eyelashes and eyebrows, wrinkled eyelids and lips</u>\n\n【15】At that time, we made no further investigations. We recommended avoiding high environmental temperatures, dressing him lightly and washing him frequently on hot days, without drying him. We also prescribed the use of artificial tears and a physiological solution to moisten the nose and ears. We informed the family that later dental prostheses would be needed and we put them in contact with other specialists to better address any foreseeable aesthetic, functional and psychological problems.\n\n【16】At 6, the boy had normal body weight and regular psychomotor development.

However, these sequelae in the case of syphilis tend to appear later. Furthermore the particular phenotype of our patient, as well as hypodontia, conical teeth and other clinical features described ruled out the diagnosis of congenital syphilis.\n\n【29】In Ellis van Creveld syndrome , dental changes with partial agenesis or conical teeth can be observed. However, this syndrome is also characterized by short stature, congenital heart disease, typical skeletal manifestations and polydactyly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u> which are absent in our case.\n\n【30】Tricho-dento-osseous (TDO) syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterised by curly hair at infancy, anomalies of the eyelashes and eyebrows, hypoplasia and taurodontism of teeth, sclerotic bone, palmar and plantar keratosis, “café au lait” spots with normal sweating 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Our patient presented only some of these manifestations.\n\n【31】Ectodermal dysplasias (Eds) is a genetic heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by developmental dystrophies of ectodermal structures. They mainly affect the hair, nails, teeth and sweat glands. Over 190 varieties have been described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 – 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【32】Ectodermal dysplasia anhydrotic (EDA) is the most common among Eds.\n\n【33】It includes three subtypes, not clinically differentiable, which show, as a cardinal sign, a sweating disorder:\n\n【34】1.  1.\n    Christ-Siemens-Touraine syndrome (X-linked). Associated with EDA gene (Xq12-q13.1)\n2.  2.\n    Autosomal dominant EDA. Associated with the EDAR gene (2q13)\n3.  3.\n    Autosomal recessive EDA. Associated with the EDARADD gene (1q42.3)\n\n【35】A fourth rare subtype is known, EDA with immunodeficiency.\n\n【36】Christ-Siemens-Touraine syndrome (CST) is the most common subtype (80%) and its incidence in males is estimated at 1 in 50,000–100,000 births 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【37】It is characterized by the triad of signs comprising sparse hair (atrichosis or hypotrichosis), abnormal or missing teeth (anodontia or hypodontia) and inability to sweat due to lack of sweat glands ( anhidrosis or hypohidrosis ). All these symptoms were present in our patient.\n\n【38】The autosomic recessive and dominant forms affect both sexes equally. In the X-linked form, carrier females may be asymptomatic or have a milder phenotype: oligodontia , conical incisors, hypotrichosis , and reduced sweating.\n\n【39】The defective sweating ability often leads to recurrent hyperthermic episodes (recurrent fever not otherwise explained) and heat intolerance . The recurrent hyperthermic episodes are commonly the initial presentation causing the request for medical intervention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Dry skin and eczematous dermatitis, decreased teas, and photophobia are common while onychodystrophy is not frequent.\n\n【40】Most patients with EDA have a normal life expectancy.

The conversion of NAD from its oxidized form ( NAD <sup><span class=\"bold\">+ </span></sup> ) to its reduced form ( NADH ), and back, provides the cell with a mechanism for accepting and donating electrons. NAD <sup>+ </sup> /NADH plays a significant role in the reactions associated with glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, and fermentation. Given its importance to cell function, it would be useful if there were a means of visualizing NADH in living cells. The work presented in this case study introduces a new tool for research in cell metabolism – a NADH fluorescent sensor.\n\n【4】▪ Conduct a search for an image of NAD <sup>+ </sup> . What part of the molecule is reduced in the conversion to NADH?\n\n【5】▪ Outline the involvement of NAD <sup>+ </sup> / NADH in the following reactions:\n\n【6】▪ Glycolysis\n\n【7】▪ Fermentation\n\n【8】▪ Citric acid cycle – Krebs cycle; TCA cycle\n\n【9】▪ Mitochondrial electron transport\n\n【10】▪ How does NADH move from the cytoplasm into the mitochondrial matrix?\n\n【11】Background\n----------\n\n【12】A biosensor combines a biological component with a component that will respond to a physiological or chemical cue. The fluorescent biosensor developed for the study of intracellular NADH is a fusion of a NADH-sensitive protein to a fluorescent protein. The Rex protein is a NADH-sensitive transcription factor from the bacteria Bacillus subtilis . The Rex protein only responds to NADH and not to NAD <sup>+ </sup> or NADPH. The fluorescent component of the fusion protein is a circularly permuted yellow fluorescent protein ( cpYFP ). Like all fluorescent molecules, cpYFP absorbs light at one wavelength, the excitation wavelength , and emits light at a second lower wavelength, the emission wavelength . Linking cpYFP to a “sensor” protein means that its excitation/emission properties will change in response to changes in its environment; namely, binding of NADH by Rex. The researchers who developed this biosensor named it Frex (fluorescent Rex).\n\n【13】▪ Suggest a reason a transcription factor would be sensitive to NADH levels.\n\n【14】▪ Explain why a bacterial protein can be expressed in a eukaryotic cell.\n\n【15】▪ Conduct a search to find the excitation/emission spectra for YFP.\n\n【16】▪ Why is the emission wavelength always lower than the excitation wavelength for a fluorescent molecule?\n\n【17】Methods\n-------\n\n【18】### Charactertization of Frex in vitro\n\n【19】Purified Frex protein was stored at −20°C until use. Initial fluorescence levels were determined prior to the addition of any reagents. Reactions were initiated by the addition of the indicated nucleotides, and spectra were immediately recorded. For excitation experiments spectra were recorded with an excitation range from 300 nm to 515 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm. Readings were taken every 1 nm. For emission spectra the emission range was 510–600 nm with an excitation wavelength of 498 nm.\n\n【20】### Cell culture 删除换行1 293FT cells were maintained in tissue culture media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37°C with 5% CO <sub>2 </sub> . Cells were plated in antibiotic-free high-glucose media 16 h before transfection.\n\n【21】### Fluorescence microscopy\n\n【22】For confocal fluorescence microscopy, cells were plated on 35 mm glass-bottomed dishes in growth media and observed for 24–30 h post transfection. Frex was expressed in different subcellular compartments by tagging it with organelle-specific signal peptides. Images were acquired using a laser scanning confocal microscope. For pseudocolor analysis the pixel-by-pixel ratio for a 488 nm excitation image by 405 nm excitation image of the same cell was determined. The purple (RGB value 255, 0, 255) was defined as the lowest ratio and red (RGB value 255, 0, 0) was defined as the highest ratio.\n\n【23】### Live cell fluorescence measurements 删除换行1 293FT cells were harvested, trypsinized, and counted 24–48 h after transfection. Cells were washed and aliquots of cells were incubated at 37°C with different drugs. Fluorescence excited at 485 nm was measured using a microplate reader. Dual excitation ratios were obtained using excitation wavelengths of 410 and 500 nm and an emission wavelength of 528 nm. Fluorescence values were corrected by subtracting background fluorescence of cells not expressing Frex.\n\n【24】▪ Conduct a search to learn more about 293FT cells.\n\n【25】▪ How does a signal peptide work to target a protein at a particular organelle?\n\n【26】Results\n-------\n\n【27】▪ Suggest a reason binding of NADH causes a conformational change in Rex.\n\n【28】▪ Use the model in Figure 11.3.1 b to explain how the Frex biosensor works.\n\n【29】▪ Explain the differences in fluorescence intensity in Figure 11.3.1 c using the model of Frex activity in Figure 11.3.1 b.\n\n【30】▪ Subsequent experiments using the Frex biosensor measured fluorescence of a sample after excitation with 410 and 500 nm wavelength light.

The patient’s clinical, laboratory, and histologic features are indicative of celiac sprue. The classical presentation of this disease is during infancy, but it may also present any time between the ages of 10 and 40. Classic signs include diarrhea, foulsmelling, bulky, floating stools, weight loss, growth failure, and vitamin deficiencies.

        "text": "【0】Question: 26.1 You are on duty at the emergency department. A patient is brought in by ambulance and the paramedics state: “Got no pulse.” In which of the following clinical scenarios would it be appropriate to withhold CPR?\n\n【1】A. A 28-year-old drowning victim with apnea and no spontaneous movement.\n\n【2】B. A 32-year-old man with pinpoint pupils and tract marks on arm.\n\n【3】C. A 46-year-old woman with breast cancer whose advance directive states no CPR desired, but her daughter tells you to do “everything possible.”\n\n【4】D. A 19-year-old man brought out of a burning building with no movement and no spontaneous respirations.\n\n【5】Answer: 26.1 C. Withholding CPR is generally performed in compliance with an advance directive, obvious signs of irreversible death, and with clear physiologic futility (which often takes time to evaluate completely). The 46-year-old woman with breast cancer and an advance directive is the most appropriate patient to withhold CPR, even though the daughter is insisting that everything be done. The patient’s wishes generally take priority over family members’ instructions. The other scenarios describe situations of potentially reversible brain dysfunction. Drowning victims may be successfully resuscitated even after being submerged for 30 minutes and sometimes even longer. A patient with possible heroin overdose may outwardly show absence of brain function, but may gain function with resuscitation and opiate reversal. A patient who has been in a burning building can experience smoke inhalation or carbon monoxide poisoning, but he or she should be resuscitated before a conclusion is drawn about possible brain death or physiologic futility.\n\n【6】Question: 26.2 An 82-year-old woman with colon cancer and liver metastases was admitted for chemotherapy. Because of her poor prognosis, she is asked about a DNR order, but she requests to be a “full code.” Which is the most appropriate management of this patient’s condition?\n\n【7】A. Explain to the patient that signing a DNR order means she will need to be placed in hospice care.\n\n【8】B. Emphasize to her with compassion that a decision should be made in the next several hours in the event that cardiac arrest occurs.\n\n【9】C. Sharing this decision with family members is rarely helpful because guilt is often a complicating factor.\n\n【10】D. Discuss with the patient that a DNR order will not mean she will receive less care.\nAnswer: 26.2 D. This patient is elderly and has metastatic cancer. Out-of-hospital survival would not be expected should this patient require CPR. Thus, CPR for MW could be described as being a futile effort. The patient does not meet other criteria for futility. It is important that she is of sound mind. A DNR order should not be written even if CPR would be judged to be futile unless the patient or family members concur. Patients must be given time to understand the seriousness of their diagnosis. Periodically readdressing the question of CPR with patients and their family should be done on a continual basis. This is best performed in the context of other medical decisions that occur during patient care. The health care professional should emphasize that a DNR order does not mean that the patient will be abandoned or receive a lower standard of care.\n\n【11】KEY POINTS\n\n【12】 Brain death is defined as the irreversible loss of brain function, including brain stem function, and is different from brain injury.\n\n【13】 Brain death is a clinical diagnosis and depends on the absence of spontaneous movement, brain stem function, and apnea.\n\n【14】 CPR can be withheld due to a valid advanced directive or when there is clear evidence of irreversible death (rigor mortis).\n\n【15】 Discussions about organ donation should be approached with sensitivity and only after dealing with the questions about brain death.",

        "text": "【0】Case 16\nA 34-year-old man presents to the emergency department (ED) complaining of shortness of breath and chest pain that he describes as right sided and increased with deep breathing. He states it started suddenly when he woke up and was worse with activity. He denies fever， chills， nausea， vomiting， or cough. He has a recent history of multiple gunshot wounds resulting in ongoing pain in his upper back and T-10 paraplegia. One week ago， he was discharged from the hospital to a rehabilitation facility. He is currently taking acetaminophen/hydrocodone and ibuprofen for his pain， which has increased with his physical therapy and occupa-tional therapy. He is also taking hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril for hyperten-sion and fluoxetine for depression. He recently quit smoking tobacco since he was hospitalized and denies any alcohol or illicit drug use. On physical examination， he is an otherwise fit young man who appears slightly short of breath and uncom-fortable. His heart rate is 101 beats per minute， his blood pressure is 110/78 mm Hg， and his respiratory rate is 26 breaths per minute. His pulse oximetry is 96%on2 L of O， by nasal canula. His lungs are clear to auscultation. There is mild swell-ing of his left calf. He has no sensation in his lower extremities. Laboratory studies reveal a white blood cell count (WBC) of 10，000/mm. Hemoglobin， hematocrit， electrolytes， and renal function are all within normal limits. A 12-lead electrocar-diogram (ECG) reveals a sinus rhythm at a rate of 103 beats per minute. His chest radiograph reveals minimal bibasilar atelectasis but no evidence of infiltrates or effusions.\n\n【1】What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【2】What is your next diagnostic step?\n 16:\nSummary： A 34-year-old man with hypertension， depression， and recent gunshot wounds resulting in T-10 paraplegia presents with dyspnea， pleuritic and right-sided chest pain， tachypnea， tachycardia， left calf swelling， and bibasilar atelectasis on chest radiography.1\\. Learn the clinical presentations of PE.\n\n【3】2\\. Learn to formulate reasonable diagnostic strategy for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in the emergency department setting.\n\n【4】3\\. Learn the sensitivity， specificity， and limitations of the D-dimer test and the contrast-enhanced helical computed tomography angiogram for the diagnosis of DVT and PE.This 34-year-old patient who has been immobilized has a primary risk factor for venous thromboembolism. The presentation of acute dyspnea， chest pain， border-line tachycardia， and unilateral lower extremity swelling in the absence of identifi-able alternative cardiopulmonary disease place him in the high-risk category for a pulmonary embolism. An ECG in patients with suspected PE is generally helpful for identifying other etiologies of his symptoms such as ischemic heart disease， pericar-ditis， and dysrhythmias. In some instances， the ECG may reveal right-heart strain patterns that are more specific for the diagnosis of PE. Although nonspecific， sinus tachycardia is still the most frequent presenting ECG finding among patients with PE. Even 25% of patients with identified PE may have a normal ECG. The rela-tively normal chest radiograph is valuable in eliminating alternative diagnoses， such as pneumonia， pneumothorax， and congestive heart failure. An arterial blood gas can be used to assess patients with shortness of breath， but it is non-specific in the diagnosis of PE. Taking into consideration the clinical， radiographic， and ECG data， a presumptive diagnosis of PE can be made. The next steps in management include maintenance of cardiopulmonary stability， consideration of empiric anticoagulation therapy， and confirmation of the diagnosis.D-DIMER ASSAY： Fibrin D-dimer is released into the circulation following degra-dation of cross-linked fibrin by plasmin. Multiple commercial assays are available that use a monoclonal antibody to detect the D-dimer fragment. The two most com-monly used assays are the whole blood immunoagglutination test (less accurate) and the quantitative plasma ELISA assay (more accurate). Elevated levels may indicate the presence of concurrent thrombus formation and degradation. Other conditions in which D-dimer elevation occurs include sepsis， recent myocardial infarction or stroke (<10 days)， recent surgery or trauma， disseminated intravascular coagulation， collagen vascular disease， metastatic cancer， pregnancy， hospitalized patients and liver disease. The D-dimer may be falsely negative if clot formation is greater than72 hours before the blood is assayed. Conversely， it may be falsely positive since levels may remain elevated for as long as 2 years. In pregnancy， the upper limits of normal are increased with each trimester， but a true normal D-dimer should never be greater than 1000 ug/L.COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY PULMONARY ANGIOGRAPHY (CTPA)：Magnified CT imaging of the pulmonary vasculature obtained during the arterial phases of venous contrast injection. While highly specific for PE， the reported sen-sitivity is variable and ranges from 50% to 90%. The diagnostic sensitivity is higher for centrally located PE but reduced for subsegmental clots. The Prospective Investi-gation of Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis II (PIOPED II) study suggests that CTPA identifies more PE than V/Q scanning， but these may be false-positives or clots that do not require anticoagulation. The diagnostic accuracy is also related to observer expertise. The initiation of multidetector CT scanning has greatly improved imag-ing of central， segmental， and subsegmental arteries. An advantage of this modality is its ability to detect alternative diagnoses. Pulmonary MDCT angiography has a reported sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 96% in PIOPED II.Up to 60% of patients with untreated proximal DVT will develop PE； conse-quently， accurate diagnosis of this condition is critical for emergency physicians. Unfortunately， the clinical features of DVT are frequently nonspecific， and may include pain， tenderness， swelling， edema， and erythema. The physical examination and thromboembolic risk factors  are important in assessing the clinical suspicion (ie， pretest probability)， and based on the pretest probability， clinical algo-rithm for the diagnosis of lower extremity DVT may be formulated 删除33：<u></u>.\n\nDuplex ultrasound is the most common test used to evaluate for the presence of DVT. Its accuracy approaches 98% for proximal DVT detection， when an experienced operator performs the test. ELISA D-dimer can serve as a screening tool for DVT. In practice， a positive ELISA D-dimer is not of any clinical value. However， due to its high sensitivity， a negative ELISA D-dimer suggests the absence of an acute thrombus. In patients with low pretest probability and a negative ELISA D-dimer， the diagnosis of DVT can be ruled out. Venography is the traditional gold standard for DVT. However， due to its invasiveness， risk of reaction to contrast dye， and the advent of newer tech-nologies that are just as accurate， venography is rarely used in clinical practice\n增加换行3：| Table 16-1· RISK FACTORS FOR VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM DISEASE  |  |  |\n| Acquired Disorders  | Medical Conditions  | Inherited Disorders  |\n| Prior history of venous thromboembolism Immobilization Malignancy—active Obesity Trauma Surgery-recent <4 wk Pregnancy Smoking Central venous catheters Estrogen use Lupus anticoagulant  | Congestive heart failure Nephrotic syndrome Myocardial infarction Stroke Hyperviscosity syndromeCrohn disease  | Factor V Leiden Protein C and S deficiency Antithrombin Ill deficiency Other blood factor deficiencies  |\n\n【6】删除3：<u>Figure 16-1.

In patients with extensive DVT that involves the iliac and femoral veins， the use of thrombolytic therapy should be considered to help minimize the postphlebitic sequelae. For most patients， acute management consists of anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH). When UFH therapy is selected， it is vital to achieve therapeutic levels rapidly. When this is accomplished within 24 hours， the DVT recurrence rate is 4% to 6%， compared to 23% when therapeutic levels are delayed. LMWH can be administered for the treatment of DVT with or without PE. Enoxaparin is a commonly used LMWH . Patients developing recurrent DVT during optimal anticoagulation therapy should undergo evaluation for hypercoagulability conditions and be considered for inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement (eg， Greenfield filter). IVC filters are also useful for individuals with contraindications to anticoagulation. However， these filters present their own risks for developing thrombosis and PE and have limited effect over time.Few common medical conditions are as difficult to diagnose as PE. The majority of patients have dyspnea and chest pain at presentation， whereas cardiovascular col-lapse is observed in 10% of the patients. Symptoms of PE include sudden onset cough(3%-55%)， blood-streaked sputum (3%-40%)， sudden onset of dyspnea at rest or with exertion (75%)， splinting of ribs with breathing， chest pain (50%-85%)， and diaphoresis (25%-40%). Nonspecific signs of PE include tachypnea (50%-60%)， tachycardia (25%-70%)， rales/crackles (50%)， and low-grade fever (7%-50%)， the latter of which is suggestive of pulmonary infarction. Tachypnea is the most com-monly reported sign in patients diagnosed with PE. Chest pain associated with PE is commonly pleurtitic in nature. The “classic triad\" for PE (hemoptysis， dyspnea，\n\n| Table 16-2·TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR DVT/PE  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Agent  | Loading Dose  | Maintenance Dose  | Monitoring of Levels  |\n| Unfractionated Heparin (UFH)  | 5000 units (80U/kg)  | 1000 units/h  | Yes targetPTT 50-90  |\n| Unfractionated Heparin (UFH)  | 5000 units (80U/kg)  | (18U/kg/h)  | Yes targetPTT 50-90  |\n| Low-molecular-weight heparin's (LMWH)  |  |  |  |\n| Enoxaparin  | None  | 1.5 mg/kg SQ qd Or 1 mg/kg SQ bid  | None  |\n| Dalteparin  | None  | 200 IU/kg SQ qd 100 IU/kg SQ bid  | None  |\n| Fondaparinux  | None  | <100 lbs 5 mg daily110-220 lb 7.5 mg daily>220 lb 10 mg daily  | None  |\n| Long-term oral therapy  |  |  |  |\n| Warfarina  | 5 mg PO qd  | Varies  | INR 2-3  |and chest pain删除38：<u>)</u> occurs in fewer than 20% of patients in whom PE is diagnosed. PE is occasionally diagnosed in young， active patients presenting to the ED complaining only of pleuritic chest pain. Such patients are often dismissed inappropriately with inadequate workups and nonspecific diagnoses such as musculoskeletal chest pain or pleurisy. Spontaneous onset of chest wall tenderness without a history of trauma is worrisome， because this may be the only physical finding of PE. In a recent study by Courtney et al， non-cancer-related throbophilia， pleuritic chest pain and family his-tory of VTE increased the probablility of PE or DVT. Unusual clinical presentations of PE also include seizure， syncope， abdominal pain， high fever， productive cough， adult-onset asthma， new-onset supraventricular arrhythmias， or hiccups.The diagnosis of PE remains a difficult task despite the multitude of resources. Rou-tine tests obtained in the ED， such as radiographs， ABGs， and ECG provide limited and nonspecific information. In an effort to make the correct diagnosis， EPs must calculate a pretest probability for PE. There are multiple scoring systems available that attempt to classify patients into low， intermediate， and high-risk categories. A commonly used scoring system is the Wells criteria . Based on findings from the PIOPED study， clinicians correctly excluded pulmonary embolism 91%of the time in low-clinical-probability patients； however， in the intermediate- and high-probability patients， clinicians correctly diagnosed PE only 64% to 68% of the time. Because clinical variables alone lack power to permit treatment decisions， patients with intermediate to high probability must undergo further testing until the diagnosis is proven， ruled out， or an alternative diagnosis is identified.\nThe Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria (PERC) is another commonly used clinical decision rule . This rule only applies to those who are low risk for PE. If eight of the clinical criteria are met， then there is less than a 2% risk that the patient has a PE and no further work-up is needed.\n\n| Table 16-3。 WELLS CRITERIA FOR ASSESSMENT OF PRETEST  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |\n| PROBABILITY OF PULMONARY EMBOLISM  |  |  |  |\n| Criterion  |  |  | Points  |\n| Suspected DVT  |  |  | 3  |\n| An alternate diagnosis is less likely than PE  |  |  | 3  |\n| HR>100 beats/min  |  |  | 1.5  |\n| Im mobilization or surgery in the previous 4 weeks  |  |  | 1.5  |\n| Previous DVT/PE  |  |  | 1.5  |\n| Hemoptysis  |  |  | 1  |\n| Malignancy (being treated currently or in the last 6 months)  |  |  | 1  |\n| Score Range (Points)  | Mean Probability of PE  | Interpretation of Risk  |  |\n| 0-2  | 4%  | LOW  |  |\n| 3-6  | 21%  | Moderate  |  |\n| \\>6  | 67%  | High  |  |\n删除23：<u>Data from Wells PS， Anderson DR， Rodger M， et al.

However， there is no finding on chest radiograph that is diagnostic of PE. Rarely， the classic Westermark sign (peripheral lung vasoconstric-tion) and Hampton hump (pleural wedge-shaped density associated with pulmonary infarction) are seen. Serial CXRs obtained in a patient with PE are frequently associ-ated with progression suggestive of atelectasis， pleural effusion， and elevated hemi-diaphragm. After 2 to 3 days， the CXR in one-third of patients with PE demonstrates focal infiltrates mimicking pneumonia. Because of the variability in these findings， chest radiography is of limited use in diagnosing PE.",

Antigens from food， commensal microorganisms， or pathogens that enter the mucosal lymphoid tissues through M cells can initiate adaptive immune responses， including the production of IgA antibodies. In the absence of infection， dendrtic cells presenting antigens(such as those derived from food and commensal microorganisms) to naive T cells in the mucosa tend to stimulate the production of regulatory T cells (Treg cells)， thus avoiding a damaging inflammatory response to the commensal microbiota.

The cells and organs of the gut mucosal immune system are collectively known as the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). The GALT is the largest lymphoid tissue in the human body， containing a significant portion ofthe body's2×10-2lymphocytes.\n\n【3】Neutrophils， macrophages， and dendritic cells of the innate immune system express pattern recognition receptors and act as sensors for potentially pathogenic microorganisms in the gut. Pattern recognition receptors recognize lipids， carbo-hydrates， nucleic acids， and peptides that are common features of bacteria， viruses， fungi，and parasites.One important class of these receptors is the Toll-like receptors(TLRs)， which are located at the cell surface and in the membranes of endosomes. Activation of TLRs by microorganisms and their products triggers innate immune pathways that mediate inflammation and host defense 删除33：<u></u>. NOD pro-teins (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing proteins) comprise another class of pattern recognition receptors； these are located in the cytoplasm and bind to bacterial peptidoglycans released during infection 删除33：<u></u>.\n\n【4】The professional antigen-presenting cells of the gut mucosa-the macrophages and dendritic cells-take up and kill bacteria via phagocytosis， and present bacte-rial antigens to， and activate， the resident naive T cells and B cells within the GALT. B cells within the bowel wall are activated to produce antigen-specific secretory dimeric IgA antibodies， which are transported into the gut lumen. Between 3 and5 g of IgA is secreted into the intestinal lumen daily， where it functions to neutral-ize pathogenic bacterial proteins required for mucosal colonization and transloca-tion and also helps prevent invasion by the gut's commensal microbiota. The GALT includes a full complement of T lymphocytes： CD4 helper T cells (THl and TH2) and CD8 cytotoxic T cells， and the more recently characterized lineages of CD4effector T cells， regulatory T cells (Treg cells)andTH17 cells. The role ofTH17 cells in autoimmunity and inflammation has generated intense research interest. In some contexts， TH17 cells may have a protective role in preventing gut inflammation and maintaining homeostasis with the bacterial flora.\n\n【5】Given the high concentration of bacteria in the distal ileum and the colon (more than 10-2organisms per gram)， the mucosal immune system performs a remarkable 删除换行4 function in promoting the colonization of beneficial bacteria， which contribute to nutrient digestion， while mediating the destruction， clearance， and development of immunologic memory to pathogens and toxins. Dysregulation of the complex mechanisms responsible for mucosal immune function can result in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-most commonly， Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.\n删除3：<u>Fig. 37.2 Epithelial cells have a crucial role in innate defense against pathogens.

The cytokines IL-1 and IL-6 are also produced and activate macrophages and other components of the acute inflammatory response. The epithelial cells also express MIC-A and MIC-B and other stress-related nonclassical MHC molecules， which can be recognized by cells of the innate immune system. lkB， inhibitor of NFKB.</u>\n\n【6】Dorian was a healthy 8-year-old when he developed painful swelling and redness of his right elbow. The following day， he developed mouth ulcers (aphthous ulcers) that persisted for several days. He was taken to the pediatrician， who thought that the ulcers could be due to a Coxsackie virus infection. X-rays of the elbow were done and showed no fracture or injury. Over the next 2 months， Dorian developed frequent poorly localized abdominal pain. Passing stools was particularly difficult， and his parents would often find Dorian crying in the bathroom. He had difficulties with constipation， passing three hard stools per week， but had no bloody stool or sensation of incomplete bowel evacuation.\n\n【7】The severity of Dorian's abdominal pain， elbow swelling， and oral ulcers seemed to wax and wane over the next 2 months. Dorian developed daily low-grade fevers， at times as high as 39'C. His abdominal pain became more severe and he passed stools more frequently.Dorian was fatigued and listless and was unable to attend school. His appetite was very poor and his parents noticed that he had lost about3.5 kg over the previous 2 months. He was seen again by his pediatrician， who set up outpatient appointments to investigate Dorian’s illness. But when Dorian developed painful red lesions on his right shin and a pain in his jaw soon after this visit， his parents became concerned and brought him to the Children’s Hospital Emergency Department.\n\n【8】The Grays were asked about the health of their family and told the staff that there was no history of inflammatory bowel disease or autoimmune illness. When exam-ined， Dorian looked ill， tired， and pale. Numerous aphthous ulcers were present in his mouth. His abdominal examination showed no focal tenderness or masses. Two inflamed anal skin tags were found and the rectal exam showed no tenderness， fis-sures， or evidence of occult blood. Several raised， red skin lesions were present on Dorian’s shins and his right elbow was swollen and warm.

The white blood cell count was elevated at 14，700 ul-1 (normal 5，700-9，900 ul-)， and the platelet count was high at 759，000 ul-1 (normal 198，000-371，000 ul-1). The eryth-rocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)， an index of systemic inflammation， was elevated at 80 mm h-1 (normal 0-20 mm h-). The level of another acute-phase reactant， C-reactive protein (CRP)， was also high at 2.2 mg dl- (normal less than 0.5 mgdr). Dorian was told to return for an upper and lower endoscopy the following week.\n\n【16】On endoscopy， Dorian's pediatric gastroenterologist found ulceration of the esopha-gus and small intestine， and a perianal fistula 删除33：<u></u>. The pathologist found neutrophilic infiltration of the esophageal and ileal lesions， active colitis with rare crypt abscesses， but no granulomatous inflammation 删除33：<u></u>. The arthritis， oral aphthous ulcers， erythema nodosum lesions on the shins， and the endoscopic find- ings were all consistent with a diagnosis of Crohn's disease， and Dorian was started on a proton pump inhibitor to treat the esophageal lesions and oral corticosteroids as an initial anti-inflammatory treatment.\n\n【17】Over subsequent months， additional immunosuppressive agents in combination with oral steroids were tried， including 6-mercaptopurine and infusions of antibod-ies (infliximab and adalimumab) that inhibit the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-u (TNF-g). Unfortunately， Dorian’s symptoms were not completely controlled. A year after receiving his diagnosis， Dorian developed worsening fever and abdominal pain， and an abdominal mass in the right lower quadrant could be felt. He was admitted to the Children's Hospital； abdominal ultrasound and CT scans revealed a large abscess of the distal small intestine (ileum and cecum). He was treated with intravenous antibiotics and was taken to the operating room， where the ileum and cecum were resected ileocecectomy) and multiple smaller abscesses were drained. Dorian recovered well from surgery， continues to take weekly adali-mumab injections， and has been able to discontinue steroid therapy. Although the weekly injections are difficult for Dorian and his family， the abdominal， skin， and joint symptoms of his Crohn’s disease are all well controlled.\n\n【18】Crohn's disease.\n\n【19】Crohn's disease was first described in the medical literature by the Italian physi-cian Giovanni Battista Morgagni， who presented the case of a chronically ill young man with diarrhea in 1769. American physician Burrill Crohn and colleagues published a case series of patients with \"regional ileitis\" in 1932. Crohn’s disease is a disorder of mucosal immune dysregulation that is characterized by inflam-matory lesions that can involve the entire gastrointestinal tract， from mouth to anus. In 40-50% of pediatric cases， Crohn's disease involves the ileum and colon.\n\n【20】By contrast， ulcerative colitis， typically involves only the colon and rectum. Biopsy evidence of inflammatory cell infiltrate is ‘transmural'in Crohn's disease in that it may involve the epithelium， the lamina propria， and other layers of the bowel wall删除33：<u></u>. As a result， fistulas and intra-abdominal abscesses， as in Dorian's case， are frequent complications. The presence of extra-intestinal inflammatory manifestations of IBDs， including skin (erythema nodosum， pyoderma gangreno-sum)， joints (IBD-related arthritis)， and eyes (uveitis)， underscores that IBDs are systemic inflammatory diseases. Colon cancer occurs with increased frequencyin individuals with ulcerative colitis.\n\n【21】Breakthroughs in understanding the pathogenesis of IBDs as a result of new human genetics tools and animal disease models have focused attention on the dysregu-lation of mucosal immunity to the gut commensal microbiota and a resulting impaired mucosal barrier function 删除33：<u></u>. These recent discoveries have identified proteins that participate in innate immune recognition of bacteria， cell-ular stress-response pathways， and host-microbiota interactions as targets of new therapies for IBD patients. The finding that deficiencies in the NFKB signal pathway component NEMO 删除25：<u></u>， IL-10， the IL-10 receptor， or Treg cells result in IBD provides evidence that the innate immune system and Treg cells are essential in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Mice with genetic disruption of genes for the cytokines interleukin (IL)-2， which is essential for Treg cell function， or IL-10， an immunosuppressive cytokine， are protected from the development of intestinal inflammation only when raised in germ-free conditions， revealing an essential role for host-microbiota interactions in initiating IBD pathogenesis. Isoforms of the cytokine receptor IL-23R have been shown to confer both susceptibility to and pro-tection from Crohn's disease， indicating complex regulatory roles of Treg and TH17cells in intestinal inflammation. The cytokine IL-23 is required for TH17-cell main-tenance and survival. Th17 and Treg cells have a reciprocal relationship， because both compete for the cytokine TGF-B for their induction， which in the case ofTH17cells， but not Treg cells， also requires IL-23R.\n\n【22】Genome-wide association studies， which mine genetic data from large popula-tions of patients and control individuals to identify variants of genes that con-fer increased disease risk， have led to new knowledge related to Crohn's disease删除33：<u></u>.Mutations in NOD2， an intracellular innate immune receptor， expressed in macrophages and epithelial cells， that binds to muramyl dipeptides from bacte rial cell walls and activates the production ofinflammatory cytokines 删除33：<u></u> results in severe ileal Crohn’s disease. Intestinal epithelial cells from individuals with a Crohn's disease-associated mutation in NOD2 have impaired secretion of antimicrobial peptides called defensins when exposed to invasive bacteria. Blau syndrome， a rare autosomal dominant condition characterized by granulomatous inflammation of the eyes， skin， and joints， has also been found to be due to muta-tions in NOD2.\n\n【23】Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved cellular stress-response pathway that delivers intracellular organelles and cytoplasmic contents to the lysosomes for degradation. Autophagy is important for walling off and eliminating bacteria that escape into the cytosol or enter it directly. ATG16L1 and IRGM are two genes whose products are important for the formation of the autophagocytic vacuole. Identification of disease-related variants of the ATG16Ll and IRGM genes impli-cate defects in autophagy in Crohn's disease， possibly because inefficient elimina-tion of microbes from the cytosol leads to sustained cytokine secretion and Paneth cell dysfunction， resulting in intestinal inflammation. Cellular stress caused by misfolded proteins， metabolic factors， and microbes activate what is known as the unfolded protein response. This response activates the transcription factor XBP1， which regulates the expression of genes important for the proper function of the immune system. Defects in XBP1 result in IBD in mouse models， and XBP1 vari-ants have been described in patients with Crohn's disease， suggesting that abnor-malities in the cellular stress response may result in intestinal inflammation and decreased survival of Paneth cells.\n\n【24】删除3：<u>Fig. 37.5 Genome-wide association studies reveal patterns of Crohn’s disease pathogenesis.</u>",

Dark marks appeared after resolution of acne lesions on the chest and are not associated with any symptoms. Acne is still present but has abated in severity over the past 5 years, initially involving the face and back but persisting on the chest. Treatment with over the counter hydroquinone 2 % cream twice a day for 4 months has been ineffective.\n\n【21】Physical Examination\n--------------------\n\n【22】Skin examination revealed several scattered ill-defined hyperpigmented macules and patches localized to the chest along with 3 scattered erythematous papules 删除33：<u></u>.\n\n【23】删除3：<u>Figure 13.1\n\n【24】Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. 30 year-old African-American woman with ill-defined hyperpigmented macules and patches on the chest</u>\n\n【25】Clinical Differential Diagnosis\n-------------------------------\n\n【26】In this particular case of scattered macules and patches involving the chest, one may consider diagnoses such as pityriasis versicolor, postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) or erythema dyschromicum perstans. The former tends to present with surface scale, while the latter may have a component of erythema and a more widespread distribution. The differential diagnosis of hyperpigmentation can be vast and depends on the clinical presentation. Preceding inflammation may be subclinical in some instances, which may further complicate diagnosis. History, morphology and distribution can help narrow down potential inciting factors.\n\n【27】Histopathology\n--------------\n\n【28】Hyperpigmentation on histology can be epidermal, dermal or mixed, where an excess of melanin is present in both the epidermis and dermis 删除10：<u>(Ortonne and Passeron 2005 )</u>. Most cases of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation will show increased pigmentation in basal epidermal keratinocytes; however, there may also be a dermal component, showing melanophages. Clinically, brown and blue hyperpigmentation are caused by excessive amounts of melanin within the epidermis or dermis, respectively. Focal deposition of melanin is mainly seen in PIH, which can occur after a burn, laceration, acne or any inflammation inducing insult to the skin 删除10：<u>(Davis and Callender 2010 )</u>.\n\n【29】Diagnosis\n---------\n\n【30】Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) secondary to acne vulgaris.\n\n【31】Case Treatment\n--------------\n\n【32】As aforementioned, the patient did not note improvement with 4 months of twice a day use of over-the-counter hydroquinone 2 % cream. Hydroquinone 4 % cream twice a day to affected areas, along with daily broad spectrum sunscreen with at least sun protection factor 30 were recommended. In addition to addressing treatment of hyperpigmentation, the underlying causative condition, acne vulgaris, was also treated with benzoyl peroxide 4 % wash followed by topical clindamycin 1 % lotion every morning. Three months of this treatment regimen caused significant clinical improvement of hyperpigmentation.\n\n【33】Discussion\n----------\n\n【34】Hyperpigmentation is an umbrella term for a group of conditions that cause dark discoloration of the skin and includes melasma, PIH and medication-induced hyperpigmentation. Hyperpigmentation most commonly affects patients with Fitzpatrick skin phototypes IV-VI who are often patients of African, Asian, Hispanic, Pacific Islander, and/or Native Hawaiian backgrounds. There is no gender or age predilection. Considering dyschromia is one of the top five skin diagnoses in African-American patients, keen knowledge of pathogenesis, diagnosis and available treatment options for hyperpigmentation is of vital importance 删除10：<u>(Alexis et al. 2007 )</u>. While considered cosmetic by some standards, dyschromias, such as PIH may have lasting psychosocial effects.\n\n【35】Acne-induced PIH is a particularly common occurrence in patients of color 删除33：<u></u>. In a 2002 study that evaluated acne in skin of color, 65.3 % of African-American (N = 239), 52.7 % of Hispanic (N = 55), and 47.4 % of Asian (N = 19) patients acquired acne-induced PIH 删除10：<u>(Taylor et al. 2002 )</u>. Atopic dermatitis, a chronic inflammatory dermatosis, has a prevalence of 10.7 % in the US, with a significantly higher prevalence seen in both the African-American populations. A common sequela is PIH 删除10：<u>(Vachiramon et al. 2012 )</u>.\n\n【36】删除3：<u>Figure 13.2\n\n【37】Acne induced postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. A young African-American woman with hyperpigmented macules on the cheek as a result of mild inflammatory acne vulgaris</u>\n\n【38】The etiology of PIH has not been fully elucidated, however, it is hypothesized to involve inflammatory mediators, including prostaglandins (PGE2) and leukotrienes (LTC4 and LTD4). These mediators go on to stimulate epidermal melanocytes, causing an increase in melanin synthesis in the basal layer of the epidermis or release of melanin from labile melanocytes into the dermis. Elevation of melanin in the dermis in turn activates dermal macrophages 删除10：<u>(Desai 2014 )</u>.\n\n【39】Treatment\n---------\n\n【40】The initial approach to treating PIH begins with identifying and treating the underlying dermatosis. Once this is achieved, the resulting hyperpigmentation may then be targeted. A crucial element in the treatment of hyperpigmentation is the use of photoprotection. Use of a broad spectrum sunscreen with a sun protection factor of 30 or higher every two hours during sun-exposure will effectively prevent the worsening of hyperpigmentation 删除10：<u>(Desai 2014 )</u>. After any possible inciting causes and photoprotection are addressed, it is then reasonable to initiate topical skin lightening agents. Such agents, alone or in combination, include: hydroquinone (HQ), mequinol, azelaic acid, kojic acid, retinoids, and soy.\n\n【41】HQ is a potent inhibitor of melanin production by competitively inhibiting tyrosinase, the key regulatory enzyme in the conversion of amino acid tyrosine to melanin within melanocytes. By decreasing the production of melanin, HQ once or twice daily effectively lightens the skin. It is important to know that at higher concentrations (4 % or higher), HQ can pose a strong irritant effect (e.g. contact dermatitis). Any strength of hydroquinone can cause a paradoxical hypermelanosis termed exogeneous ochronosis with prolonged unmonitored use 删除10：<u>(Ortonne and Passeron 2005 )</u>. Although the exact amount of time required to cause ochronosis has not been delineated, clinical monitoring of patients using HQ and limiting refills can be preventative. Mequinol (4-hydroxyanisole) also functions as a competitive inhibitor of tyrosinase and is a less irritating derivative of HQ, which can be used as an alternative in patients who are particularly sensitive to HQ 删除10：<u>(Davis and Callender 2010 )</u>.\n\n【42】Azelaic acid is a naturally occurring dicarboxylic acid produced by yeast, malassezia furfur that live on the skin. Dicarboxylic acid functions to inhibit tyrosinase, thereby, reducing the production of melanin. In addition, azelaic acid, 15 or 20 % is used to treat both comedonal and inflammatory acne by decreasing the bacterial load and keratin on the skin. In fact, a randomized controlled trial performed on 52 Fitzpatrick skin types IV-VI patients who presented with facial hyperpigmentation showed a visible decrease of pigment intensity after 24 weeks of treatment with 20 % azelaic acid cream 删除10：<u>(Davis and Callender 2010 )</u>. Reported adverse effects include desquamation, pruritus, transient erythema, and irritation; all of which are usually mild and resolve within a few weeks 删除10：<u>(Alexis and Blackcloud 2013 )</u>.\n\n【43】Kojic acid, a fungal metabolite, is yet another potent inhibitor of tyrosinase that can be compounded with other lightening agents, like HQ, to increase its effectiveness at reducing hyperpigmentation. However, there is a paucity of data showing its efficacy in the treatment of PIH. Common side effects of kojic acid are contact dermatitis and increased skin sensitization, which can also lead to PIH in patients of color 删除10：<u>(Alexis and Blackcloud 2013 )</u>.\n\n【44】Functioning as derivatives of vitamin A, topical retinoids (e.g. tretinoin) are effective alone or combined with other topicals, including HQ, to treat hyperpigmentation in patients with darker complexions. Through several biologic effects that include the interference of melanogenesis and enhancement of both keratinocyte proliferation and epidermal cell turnover, tretinoin improves acne-induced PIH in patients of color. Potential adverse effects include erythema, desquamation, dryness, pruritus, and PIH.\n\n【45】Soy, formulated alone or with other agents like retinol, functions as an inhibitor of protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR-2) that are found on keratinocytes and mediate the transfer of melanosomes from melanocytes to the surrounding keratinocytes 删除10：<u>(Alexis and Blackcloud 2013 )</u>. As a result, the phagocytosis of melanosomes into keratinocytes is reduced, triggering a reversible skin lightening effect in patients with acne-induced PIH. Although soy products are well tolerated, there is a need for more large-scale clinical trials in patients with skin of color 删除10：<u>(Ortonne and Passeron 2005 ; Davis and Callender 2010 )</u>.\n\n【46】Adjunctive therapy with chemexfoliation (i.e. chemical peels) may be added once first line topical therapies, like HQ, have been initiated. Chemical peels are common, nonsurgical procedures that may aid in the reversal of various dyschromias and are safe in patients of color when used properly. Chemical peels, with a peeling agent such as glycolic acid (20–70 %), are well tolerated and work superficially by penetrating the papillary dermis and inducing epidermolysis, which causes the dispersal of basal layer melanin and increases dermal collagen synthesis. In patients with darker skin, salicylic acid peels have also been shown to improve the dyschromia seen in acne-associated PIH in addition to the concomitant acne (due to its comedolytic effect). Efficacy may be achieved with applications at 2–4 week intervals, with concentrations ranging between 20 and 30 % 删除10：<u>(Grimes 1999 )</u>. In addition, pretreatment with 4 % hydroquinone may improve results. Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) is another peeling agent used for treating dyschromias, but research data to support its use in Fitzpatrick skin types IV to VI is lacking. Regardless of the acid used, it is important to treat initially with the lowest concentration to avoid irritation, which can potentially worsen PIH or lead to new areas of dyspigmentation, hypertrophic scarring, or even keloid formation. Common side effects include burning sensation, superficial desquamation, and erythema. Likewise, the use of photoprotection is essential to prevent worsening PIH after chemical peeling.\n\n【47】Key Points\n\n【48】   PIH is a common condition that most dermatologists will face in practice.\n   Identification and treatment of the underlying cause of the PIH is the key to successfully treating this disorder.\n   Sun protection is an important adjunct to treatment of dyschromias.\n   Skin lightening agents such as hydroquinone are effective and safe when used properly.\n   Being mindful of the diagnostic and therapeutic nuances of dyschromias in patients of color will help to guide the approach to treatment.",

She is taken to the operation room(OR) where her lower extremity is explored， washed out， has an external fixa-tion device placed， and a wound vacuum device placed over the open wound. The surgery takes several hours， and she is admitted to the ICU after the sur-gery. Her wound vacuum output is 1.5 L of frank blood over the next 4 hours. She received 2 U of PRBCs during the surgery and has received 3 more units since arriving in the ICU， and 1 more unit is being transfused now. Her heart rate is 120 beats/minute and her blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Her current hemoglobin concentration is 7 g/dL and platelet count is 475，000. Her INR is 1.9. Her temperature is 35℃.

During the operation， there is a significant amount of bleeding from an unidentified mesenteric vessel. The surgeons have stated that they are having difficulty getting control of the vessel and have called for a vascular surgeon. While the surgeons are working to get surgical control of the bleeding， she has been transfused 6 U of PRBCs in the last hour. She is still bleeding and intermit-tently hypotensive. The next step in management is：\n\n【18】A. Continue to transfuse red blood cells based on whether she is still hypotensive.\n\n【19】B.Continue to work on surgical control of bleeding and begin a massive transfusion protocol.\n\n【20】C. Check her INR and transfuse FFP only if INR >2.0.\n\n【21】D. Administer rFVII and normal saline intravenously\n\n【22】ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS\n\n【23】41.1 D. This patient has a gunshot wound to the right upper quadrant and is hypotensive and tachycardic. His appearance is consistent with high grade of shock. He is breathing and has normal saturations， so it is unlikely that he has an injury to his chest. His abdomen is tender and he most likely has blood in his abdomen. In this patient who has already received 2 L of normal saline before reaching the hospital and is still hypotensive， it is appropriate to start giving the patient blood. In the initial trauma setting， it is inappropriate to wait for type-specific blood. The first blood transfusions should be non-type and crossed blood (Type O). A sample of the patient’s blood should be sent for analysis so that future transfusions can be cross-matched. While it is important to start warming the patient as soon as possible， immediate resuscitation with blood and blood products predicates the warming and evaluation of coagula-tion status.\n\n【24】41.2 C. This patient suffered a significant injury to her lower extremity that required an operation， fixation device， and wound vacuum placed over her open wound. After being admitted to the ICU， she continues to have several problems. Her bleeding has not stopped， she has low blood concentrations，her coagulation has elevated， and she is cold. The most concerning aspect of this patient is her continued bleeding as noted by the high output of blood in her wound vacuum. When faced with a patient who does not respond appropri-ately to resuscitation， it is important to consider that the cause is inadequate“source control.”In this case the acute surgical bleeding must be stopped so that she can be adequately resuscitated. It is likely that she will need more blood， FFP， and possibly platelets while the bleeding is being controlled， but the first step is to control surgical bleeding.\n\n【25】41.3 C. During a massive transfusion， the goal is to achieve a hemostatic resus-citation. Although this is best achieved in a 1：1：1 ratio of blood products. One pack of plateletpheresis equal to 6 to 10 packs of pooled platelet packs. Thus， after 6 to 8 U of PRBCs and FFP are given， 1 U of platelets should be administered.\n\n【26】41.4 B. This patient has required 6 U of PRBCs in the last hour and there is antici-pation that the she will have ongoing transfusion requirements. This meets the definition of a dynamic massive transfusion needs. While the surgeons are gaining surgical control of the bleeding， a massive transfusion should begin so that hemostatic resuscitation can be started to decrease the probability that the patient will become coagulopathic.\n\n【27】CLINICAL PEARLS\n\n【28】UUpto one-third ofall trauma patients who arrive tothe emergency depart-ment are already coagulopathic.\n\n【29】The “triad of death” is the presence of coagulopathy， acidosis， and hypo-thermia. Each of these detrimental conditions exacerbates the other and should be preempted by active warming of the patient and the use of hemostatic resuscitation.\n\n【30】The current recommendation for massive transfusions is that it should be done in a 1：1：1 ratio of PRBCs：FFP：platelets.\n\n【31】The standard coagulation laboratory studies lag behind in severely injured trauma patients undergoing massive transfusions. TEG or ROTEM anal-ysis is likely a better representation of the patient's actual coagulation status.\n\n【32】One unit ofsingle pool plateletpheresis is equivalent to 6-10 units ofran-domly donated platelets and is given for every 6 units of packed RBC in the massive transfusion protocol.",

        "text": "【0】Question: A 44-year-old woman presents with worsening fatigue for the past two months. She recently overcame her battle with alcoholism and says her next goal is to improve her “horrible diet.” Physical examination is unremarkable. Laboratory studies are significant for a hemoglobin level of 8 g/dL and a mean corpuscular volume of 110 fL. A folic acid deficiency is suspected. Which of the following is the most accurate description of the function of folic acid?\n\n【1】> (A) Catalyzes γ-carboxylation of glutamic acid residues\n\n【2】> (B) Hydroxylates prolyl and lysyl residues\n\n【3】> (C) Increases intestinal calcium and phosphate absorption\n\n【4】> (D) Makes up the constituents of the visual pigments\n\n【5】> (E) Transfers one-carbon intermediates\n\n【6】 Answer: The correct answer is E . Folic acid plays a key role as a coenzyme for one-carbon transfer as seen in methylation reactions and is essential for the biosynthesis of purines and the pyrimidine thymidine. Deficiency of the vitamin is characterized by growth failure in children and macrocytic megaloblastic anemia. The anemia is a result of diminished DNA synthesis in erythropoietic stem cells. Large cells are seen with mean cell volumes of 100-150 fL and reduced levels of hemoglobin. Folic acid is a water-soluble vitamin stored in small amounts by the body; thus a continuous supply is needed from foods such as green, leafy vegetables, lima beans, and whole-grain cereals. Nutrient deficiency can commonly lead to folate deficiency. The deficiency is usually seen in pregnant women and alcoholics, and is the most common vitamin deficiency in the United States. Folic acid supplementation by pregnant women reduces the incidence of neural tube defects.  \nAnswer A is incorrect . Vitamin K serves as a coenzyme in the γ-carboxylation of glutamic acid residues in blood clotting proteins. A vitamin K deficiency is rarely seen because adequate amounts are generally produced by intestinal bacteria or easily obtained from the diet. Decreased bacterial production in the gut (as with antibiotics, for example) can lead to hypoprothrombinemia and, subsequently, hemorrhage. Newborns have sterile intestines and cannot initially synthesize vitamin K. Because human milk fails to provide the adequate daily requirement of vitamin K, it is recommended that all newborns receive a single dose of vitamin K as prophylaxis against hemorrhagic diseases.  \nAnswer B is incorrect . Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) acts as a coenzyme in hydroxylation of prolyl- and lysyl- residues of collagen, allowing collagen fibers to crosslink and providing greater tensile strength to the assembled fiber. A deficiency of ascorbic acid results in scurvy, a disease characterized by sore, spongy gums, loose teeth, fragile blood vessels, swollen joints, anemia, and poor wound healing.  \nAnswer C is incorrect . 1,25-Dihydroxychole-calciferol, the active molecule of vitamin D, produces its effect at the DNA level to produce proteins in intestinal cells that allow for greater calcium and phosphate absorption. Vitamin D deficiency causes a net demineralization of bone, resulting in rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. Rickets is characterized by continuous formation of collagen matrix of bone but incomplete mineralization, resulting in soft, pliable bones. In osteomalacia, demineralization of preexisting bones increases their susceptibility to fracture.  \nAnswer D is incorrect . Vitamin A (retinol) is a component of the visual pigments of rod and cone cells. This fat-soluble vitamin plays an essential role in vision, growth, maintenance of epithelial cells, and reproduction. Night blindness is one of the earliest signs of vitamin A deficiency as a result of a loss in the number of visual cells. Further deficiency can lead to dryness of conjunctiva and cornea, leading to corneal ulceration and ultimately blindness.",

This lesion is flat， nonindurated， has ill-defined borders， and is without surrounding erythema. Examination of the patient’s left axilla and neck revealed no abnormalities. No other pigmented lesions are noted during a thorough evaluation ofthe patient’s skin. According to the patient's wife， the lesion has been there for the past several months， and has increased in size and become darker over this time. The patient is otherwise healthy.\n\n【2】What is your next step?\n\n【3】What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【4】What is the best treatment for this problem?\n 41:\nSummary： A 33-year-old man presents with a suspicious pigmented skin lesion on his left shoulder.1\\.

The ABCDE approach is the recommended approach to help one rec-ognize and identify a melanoma. (A) Asymmetry； (B) border irregularity；(C) color change；(D) diameter over 6 mm；(E) enlargement or elevation.\n\n【7】All skin lesions that are concerning for malignant melanoma should be biopsied. Tissue biopsy helps confirm the diagnosis as well as determine the tumor thick-ness. Accurate tumor depth assessment is vital for patients with malignant melano-mas because this information provides prognostic information and serves as a guide for treatment. During the initial biopsy， it is important to take a full-thickness skin biopsy， which provides important microstaging information. It is unnecessary and undesirable to take a wide margin during the initial biopsy， because the size of the margin for definitive treatment is dictated by tumor thickness. Once the biopsy demonstrates melanoma and the depth of penetration is determined， the patient will need a second procedure to excise the surgical bed with an appropriate skin margin. Patients with intermediate depth melanomas (1.0-4.0 mm) should also undergo lymphoscintigraphy and SLNB to assess for regional spread of disease， because selected patients with disease involvement in the regional lymph nodes benefit from therapeutic lymph node dissection.BRESLOW MEASUREMENT： Measures the primary tumor in millimeters. This measurement is taken from the top of the epidermal granular layer to the base. In cases of ulcerated tumors， the measurement is taken from the base of the ulcer to the bottom of the tumor. Stage I is <0.75 mm； stage II is 0.75 to 1.5 mm； stage III is 1.51 to 2.25 mm； stage IV is 2.25 to 3.0 mm； stage V is>3.0 mm.\n\n【8】PROGNOSIS BASED ONTUMORDEPTH： (Estimated 5-year survival)；<1mm：95%to 100%；1 to 2 mm： 80%to 96%；2.1 to 4 mm： 60%to 75%；>4mm：50%.The incidence of melanoma is increasing worldwide. In 2014， the incidence of mela-noma in the United States is estimated at 76，000， with 9700 projected deaths from the disease. Currently， melanoma accounts for 4% of all newly diagnosed cancers in the United States and responsible for 1% of all cancer deaths. Melanoma is the fifth most common cancer in men and the seventh most common cancer in women in the United States. Risk factors for melanoma include family history， sun exposure， dysplastic nevus， a history of blistering sunburns， prior history of melanoma， and fair complexion. Patients with these risk factors should have thorough skin exam-inations on a regular basis by a trained healthcare professional. Suspicious skin lesions may be recognized based on ABCDE (Asymmetry， Borders， Color， large Diameter， and Enlargement or Elevation) characteristics .\n\n【9】The four types of melanoma are 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> superficial spreading， 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> nodular sclerosing， 删除换行1 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> lentigo maligna， and 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> acral lentiginous. By far， the most common form is the superficial spreading， which accounts for 70% of all melanoma cases. This type of lesion has a slight female predominance and typically has a prolonged radial growth phase (1-10 years) and a late vertical growth phase. In comparison to the other forms of melanomas， the superficial spreading type has a more favorable prognosis with the exception of the lentigomaligna type. Nodular sclerosing is the second most\n\n| Table 41-1·RISKFACTORS FOR MELANOMA  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Genetica  | Environmental Factors  | Other  |\n| Fair skin (2.1) Red hair 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> White 通用删除7(英):<u>(5-10)</u> \\>20 nevi on body (3.4) Blue eyes (4.5) Easily burned and unable totan (4.5) Familial cases 通用删除7(英):<u>(4-10)</u> Prior history of melanoma 通用删除7(英):<u>(900)</u>  | Sunlight (especially ultraviolet B)Areas near the equator First sunburn at young age  | Age Gender Tanning lamps Ultraviolet A Higher socioeconomic class Immunosuppression Halogenated compoundsAlcohol/tobacco Coffee/tea  |common type(~15%)， is associated with rapid vertical growth phase， and is most commonly found in the head and neck， and truncal regions. The lentigo maligna variant occurs in approximately 4% to 10% of patients and has a prolonged radial growth phase (5-15 years) with a better prognosis. Acral lentiginous type represents35%to 60%of the melanoma cases seen in African Americans， Asians， and Hispanics. These lesions occur primarily on the palms and soles of the hands and feet and in nail beds.\n\n【11】Melanoma incidence is directly related to sun exposure. To minimize sun damage，patients are advised to avoid sun exposure between the hours of 10 AM to 4 PM， seek shade， and apply sunscreen liberally. Additional protective mea-sures include the application of titanium dioxide or zinc oxide for ultraviolet A(UVA) protection.\n\n【12】Once a suspicious lesion is recognized， the next steps are to perform a thorough search for other skin lesions and then perform a biopsy. Biopsy goals are to deter-mine the histological diagnosis， and in the case of melanoma， identify the depth or thickness of the tumor (microstaging). Excisional biopsy can be performed for small lesions. For lesions that are larger or are in a cosmetically sensitive area， a full-thickness punch biopsy of the thickest portion of the lesion should be performed. When performing extremity biopsies， the skin incisions should be oriented in the longitudinal directions. Once the thickness of the primary tumor has been deter-mined by biopsy， a wide-local excision should be performed with margin size based on the tumor depth 删除25：<u></u>.\n\n【13】The regional lymph node basin is the most common first area of melanoma spread， and the sentinel lymph node(s) is/ are the first node(s) where metastatic dis-ease occurs. The probability of nodal involvement increases with increasing thick-ness of the primary tumor. Surgical lymphadenectomy is the primary therapy for patients with nodal involvement. Prior to the introduction of the SLNB technique in the late 1980s， patients with intermediate thickness (1-4 mm) melanomas often underwent prophylactic lymph node dissections， which often contributed to lymph-edema in the affected area/ extremity. Following the introduction of SLNB in the late 1980s， patients with intermediate thickness melanoma first undergo SLNB to identify lymph node metastasis， and therapeutic lymph node dissections is only per-formed if SLN Bs reveale positive node(s) .\n\n| Table 41-2·RECOMMENDED WIDE LOCALEXCISION MARGINS  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Primary Melanoma Thickness  | Marg in Size  |\n| Melanoma in situ  | 5mm  |\n| <1mm  | 1cm  |\n| 1.01-2mm  | 1-2cm  |\n| 2.01-4mm  | 2cm  |\n| \\>4mm  | \\>2cm (depending the feasibility oflarge excisionand cosmetic importance ofthe location)\"  |\n\n【15】\\More extensive local excision for melanomas >4 mm in depth is not always associated with improved survival because ofthe increased rates ofregional and distant metastases associated with these thick tumors.\n\n| Table 41-3·2009 AJCC CANCER STAGING CLASSIFICATIONS FOR MELANOMA  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Stage  | TClassification  | N Classification  | M Classification  |\n|  | Thickness  | Lymph Node  | Metastases  |\n| IA  | T<1.0 mm no ulcerations ormitosis  |  |  |\n| IB  | T<1.0 mm with ulceration ormitosis 1-2 mm no ulceration  |  |  |\n| IA  | T1.01-2 mm with ulceration2.01-4mm no ulceration  |  |  |\n| IIB  | T2.01-4mm with ulcerationT>4.0 mm no ulceration  |  |  |\n| IC  | T>4.0 mm with ulceration  |  |  |\n| IIA  | Any thickness， no ulceration  | Micrometastasis 1-3 lymph nodes  |  |\n| IIIB  | Any thickness， with ulcerationAny thickness， no ulcerationAny thickness， no ulceration  | Micrometastasis 1-3 lymph nodes1-3 palpable lymph nodes No involved lymph nodes but within-transit or satellite metastasis  |  |\n| ⅢC  | Any thickness， with ulcerationAny thickness， with or withoutulceration Any thickness， with ulceration  | Up to 3 palpable IN 4 or more matted LN or in-transitdisease+IN No IN but with in-transit metastasisor satellite metastasis  |  |\n| VI  |  |  | Lung metastases or all other sites ofmetastases or elevated LDH  |\n\n【17】The Multicenter Sentinel Lymphadenectomy Trial I (MSLT-I) published in2006 reported the findings of a randomized controlled trial of patients with pri-mary melanomas >1 mm in depth and no clinical nodal disease. The patients were randomized to clinical observation versus SLNB. When SLNB was positive or when clinical nodal recurrences occurred， the patients underwent therapeutic lymph node dissections. Overall， there was no difference in patient survival between the two treatment arms； however， when patients with positive SLNB were compared to patients randomized to initial observation and subsequently developed clini-cal nodal disease， those patients randomized to initial SLNB were found to have improved overall survival. The observations from this trial verified the accuracy of the SLNB technique for patients with melanoma and suggested that early identifi-cation and treatment of microscopic nodal disease offered an advantage over initial observation alone. Subset analysis of the MSLT-I trial suggests that patients with intermediate thickness melanomas (defined as 1.2-3.5 mm) benefited the most from early therapeutic lymph node dissections. The MSLT-II trial is currently ongoing， and is designed to assess the actual benefits of therapeutic lymph node dissection 删除换行1 in patient with primary melanoma >1.2 mm and positive SLNBs. Patients fitting these inclusion criteria are being randomized to immediate complete lymph node dissection versus ultrasound surveillance of the lymph node basin. Results of the MSLT-II should provide additional evidence to determine the subsets of patients with microscopic lymph node involvement who would benefit from therapeutic lymph node dissections.\n\n【18】Unfortunately， patients with thick melanomas and melanomas with regional lymph node involvements are at high risk for systemic disease recurrence. For those patients with confirmed lymph node metastasis， the initial evaluation with CT scans or PET scans can be helpful in identifying occult distant metastasis. Adju-vant therapy with interferon-2A (Intron-A) is a therapeutic option for patients with stage III melanoma， but is associated significant side-effects on the patients’physical and emotional well-being. There are several options currently offered for patients presenting with melanoma with distant metastasis. These include surgical excision for isolated distant disease， dacarbazine， interleukin-2 (IL-2)， and biologic response modifier such as ipilimumab (an anticytotoxic T-cell antigen 4 monoclo-nal antibody) and vemurafenib (BRAF inhibitor). The selection of optimal treat-ment options for patients with advanced diseases is not well-defined and needs to be individualized.Follow-up of patients after surgical resection of melanomas is important because recurrences commonly occur， especially for patients with thick melanomas or nodal disease involvement. Patients with melanomas have an increased risk of developing a second melanoma， basal cell carcinomas， and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin. The overall risk of developing a second melanoma is in the range of 5% to10% over the patient s lifetime. Therefore， all melanoma patients require life-long dermatologic surveillance. Recommended laboratory surveillance during routine follow-up include， CBC， liver functions test， and LDH which may indicate meta-static recurrences .\n\n| Table 41-4·PATIENTPROGNOSIS BY STAGE  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| AJCC Stage  | 5-year Survival  | 10-year Survival  |\n| IA  | 97%  | 95%  |\n| IB  | 92%  | 86%  |\n| IA  | 81%  | 67%  |\n| IB  | 70%  | 57%  |\n| IC  | 53%  | 40%  |\n| IIA  | 78%  | 68%  |\n| IIIB  | 59%  | 43%  |\n| ⅢIC  | 40%  | 24%  |\n| IV  | 15-20%  | 10-15%  |",

He is complaining of severe lower back pain. Radiographs and CT imaging are acquired of his lumbar spine. Which of the following findings is indicative of an unstable lumbar burst fracture that may need surgical stabilization?\n\n【1】50% loss of vertebral height at the level of injury 删除换行1 20 degrees of kyphosis at the level of injury\n\n【2】C. 30% of canal compromise\n\n【3】D.Injury to the anterior and middle spinal columns only\n\n【4】E.Injury to the posterior column only\n\n【5】27.2A 43-year-old woman who fell from a third-floor balcony presents to the ED with bilateral foot numbness as well as 2/5 bilateral extensor hallucis longus(EHL) function and absent plantar flexion. Radiographs demonstrate an L5burst fracture with 40% retropulsion and 30% loss of height. On further history， the patient states she fell 4 days ago and finally sought care because she was experiencing decreasing sensation in her groin and can no longer void. What is the next most appropriate step in management?\n\n【6】IV high-dose corticosteroids\n\n【7】Epidural steroid injection\n\n【8】Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)， bedrest， and appro-priate bracing\n\n【9】D.Surgical anterior decompression with fusion\n\n【10】E. Surgical posterior decompressive lumbar laminectomy without fusion\n\n【11】27.3A 56-year-old male rock climber falls 8 feet from a ledge and lands on his buttocks. He arrives 6 hours later in the ED and complains of lower back pain. He is completely neurologically intact. Imaging of his lumbar spine shows an L3 burst fracture involving both anterior and middle columns with 30%loss of height anteriorly and minimal retropulsion. He has no other injuries. What is the most appropriate treatment for this patient?\nA.IV steroids and appropriate bracing\n\n【12】B.Low-dose narcotics， NSAIDs， and appropriate bracing\n\n【13】C. Surgical decompression with fusion\n\n【14】D. Further imaging must be obtained， including an MRI to rule out spinal cord injury\n\n【15】E. Reassurance and activity modification\n\n【16】ANSWERS\n\n【17】27.1 A. Lumbar burst fractures are considered unstable and indicate surgical stabi-lization if they involve all 3 columns， result in >40% to 50% loss of height or >30 degrees of kyphosis， or have >40% canal compromise. Burst fractures by definition are not exclusive to the posterior elements.\n\n【18】27.2 D. Although there are details suggesting that this patient’s burst fracture may be stable (ie， only 40% retropulsion and only 30% loss of height)， her progres-sive neurologic symptoms are indication for surgical intervention. E is incor-rect because it does not address the fracture or provide stabilization， as would an anterior decompression and fusion. Local epidural steroids do not address the fracture. ⅣV steroids are controversial； however， they are not indicated greater than 8 hours from injury.\n\n【19】27.3  B. This patient has a stable burst fracture involving only the anterior and middle columns without significant loss of height or angulation. The appropriate treat-ment is pain control (narcotics are appropriate given his acute painful injury) and brace immobilization. Because the injury is stable and because he has no neurologic disruption， he does not necessarily need surgical stabilization， nor does he need extensive， expensive imaging such as an MRI. The patient may be reassured and should certainly refrain periodically from rock climbing， but requires a minimum of brace immobilization until the fracture has healed.\n\n【20】CLINICALPEARLS\n\n【21】Patients with injuries secondary to axial-loading mechanisms should be evaluated for additional associated injuries， such as calcaneus fractures and lumbar burst fractures.\n\n【22】A careful physical exam， including testing of the bulbocavernosus reflex， gives valuable information about whether neurologic injury has occurred and whether or not the patient is in spinal shock.\n\n【23】Patients with incomplete neurologic injuries (preservation of motor or sensory function below the level of the injury) should undergo urgent decompression and stabilization of the injury to maximize the likelihood of neurologic improvement or preservation.",

        "text": "【0】Question: 34.1 A male patient who is sexually active and HIV positive has 2 current partners and is refusing to disclose any information about his HIV status to them. Which of the following would not be an acceptable justification for the physician to breach physician–patient confidentiality?\n\n【1】A. The patient has more than 1 sexual partner.\n\n【2】B. Breaching confidentiality is done to protect a known person from significant harm.\n\n【3】C. The patient is not competent—as measured by guidelines—to decide about disclosure.\n\n【4】D. The physician has exhausted all possible options in working with the patient to reduce risk of infection to other known persons.\n\n【5】Answer: 34.1 A. There are certain exceptions to the general principle of patient confidentiality that may justify informing sexual partners about their risk against the patient’s wishes. If the physician fails to convince the patient of the importance of notifying sexual partners of their risk, and of acting to minimize risk of transmission to partners, then a breach to confidentiality may be considered when the harm to others is significant, or if a patient is clinically judged to be incompetent in making medical decisions. The number of partners is not relevant as a sole determinant for breech in confidentiality.\n\n【6】Question: 34.2 In outreach programs that aim to screen large populations for HIV infection, which of the following actions or services should be considered?\n\n【7】A. Distributing condoms to all participants.\n\n【8】B. Disclosing information to partners and families of persons who are HIV positive.\n\n【9】C. Pre- and post-test counseling services.\n\n【10】D. Providing Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) tests and other confirmatory tests on-site.\n\n【11】Answer: 34.2 C. In settings in which screening of many individuals is simultaneously performed, there are important considerations to ensure that adequate care is given to all patients. In areas with limited access to health care resources, pre and post-test counseling are vital in assisting patients in their decisions to be tested, as well as to follow-up on the test result. Confirmatory testing, distributing medications, and ancillary services are provided by secondary or tertiary health care centers.\n\n【12】Question: 34.3 A medical student is asked to scrub in on a caesarian delivery where the patient is known to be HIV positive. The student is reluctant to scrub in. What ethical principle is best demonstrated by this case?\n\n【13】A. Confidentiality\n\n【14】B. Duty to treat\n\n【15】C. Respect\n\n【16】D. Duty to warn\n\n【17】Answer: 34.3 B. The student’s reluctance to scrub in may be due to several factors, including personal prejudices or misconceptions. The student should recall that, first and foremost, as a physician she has a duty to treat all patients. The other principles are also applicable as the student should respect all patients and keep their information confidential.\n\n【18】Question: 34.4 A third-year medical student is completing a research elective in Haiti. As part of her studies, she is assisting a team that is investigating the prevalence of HIV in the community. She has intermediate French language skills. One afternoon, due to shortage of team personnel she is assigned the task of reporting laboratory test results, including the HIV rapid test results to the patients. She has not had any experience or training in reporting HIV results, and she is not aware of any pretest counseling or follow-up services. The manager of the team gives her a list of patients to call. How should the student respond?\n\n【19】A. Do some research on the Internet regarding how to give this news and follow the published protocol.\n\n【20】B. Discuss her concerns with her senior or supervisor at the medical camp.\n\n【21】C. Use a mobile phone application to translate for her.\n\n【22】D. Proceed to counsel the patients because they will require only a fifth-grade level of language.\nAnswer: 34.4 B. The student is not familiar with breaking bad news in this cultural context and should avoid the task of reporting to patients. She should discuss her concerns with her senior or supervisor at the medical camp. There are major ethical issues. Because one of the student’s goals is to assist with a research project that involves reporting on the prevalence of HIV infection, she may experience a conflict of interest to assist in the disclosure of results. For example, she may wish to impress her team to garner a good evaluation or to contribute substantially to the research in order to be a named author in a study publication. This setting for disclosing HIV rapid test results is different from and would not likely be appropriate at her home institution. Her actions should be driven by shared ethical principles, including equity, justice, and nonmaleficence, especially given that no pre- or post-test counseling and follow-up services are noted.\n\n【23】KEY POINTS\n\n【24】 HIV is a reportable public health infection in the United States, with varying reporting requirements by state.\n\n【25】 When balancing the duty to warn versus maintaining patient confidentiality, the key guiding ethical principles are beneficence, justice, social responsibility, and autonomy.\n\n【26】 Breach of confidentiality in cases of duty-to-warn should only be considered when 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> attempts to reason with the patient have failed, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> identifiable high-risk contacts are noted, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> the patient has been informed of the intention to disclose this information.\n\n【27】 A physician’s willingness to treat patients positive for HIV infection should be explored with attention to the attitudinal barriers and misconceptions about perceived risk that may influence decision-making.\n\n【28】 Physicians have an ethical responsibility to treat all patients without prejudice, with nonmaleficence, and with justice.\n\n【29】 In international settings with limited resources and a high prevalence of HIV infection, there is a need for pre- and post-test counseling, education about follow-up services, and attention to patient confidentiality and autonomy in informed consent for testing and in disclosure of HIV status.\n\n【30】 From a global perspective, some differences in ethical frameworks may exist, especially regarding the principles of autonomy and social responsibility.",

After transferred to our ward, high dosage IVIG infusion was given twice (totally IVIG 6 g/kg), followed by oral methylprednisolone (5 mg/kg/day). Then his symptoms were gradually settled down.\n\n【7】### 10.1.5 The Special Features of the Patient\n\n【8】1.  1.\n    The peak temperature in KD patients is usually >39 °C, even >40 °C. With timely and adequate medications (aspirin and IVIG), fever is usually improved within 36 h. Without appropriate medical treatment, the fever may last 3–4 weeks, 11 days on average. Approximately 10–20% of patients with KD are refractory to IVIG therapy, and these “non-responders” are at higher risk of developing coronary artery abnormalities. This is generally thought to be the result of failure to halt the inflammatory process and is commonly referred to as refractory or resistant KD. The differential activation of monocytes from T cells involves endothelial activation and systemic vascular inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The effects of IVIG treatment could arise from FcγRIIB-mediated immune-regulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u> and regulatory T cell functions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The standard treatment protocol for IVIG-resistant KD has not yet been established. Corticosteroids are the second most commonly used medication used to treat KD patients who have recurrent or persistent fevers after IVIG treatment. Additional second-line drugs for IVIG-resistant KD including methylprednisolone (high-dose pulse methylprednisolone 20–30 mg/kg intravenously for 3 days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>), infliximab, cyclosporine, and methotrexate have been reported.\n2.  2.\n    The best timing to give IVIG infusion is Day 5–9 after fever onset. Application of IVIG earlier than that may be one of the reasons causing IVIG non-response, possibly that IVIG disturbs the varying balance and recovery of inflammatory factors/mediators at different stages of the disease course. Timing of IVIG administration is important, as a very early treatment of KD within 4 days presents an additional risk factor for IVIG non-responsiveness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n3.  3.\n    A multicenter study indicates that IVIG non-responders are prone to develop CAA (18.6%), though initial sufficient IVIG therapy decreases the risk of IVIG nonresponse. Recent studies have focused on determining the predictive factors for initial IVIG-resistance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> and adjunctive anti-cytokine therapies to reduce the risk of cardiac sequelae 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Clinical trials and meta-analyses demonstrated that treatment with addition of corticosteroids to IVIG is beneficial for the prevention of coronary artery aneurysms in severe cases with the highest risk of IVIG-resistance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Disease susceptibility genes could affect the incidence of KD as well as the response to IVIG 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. According to the critical assessment of risk scoring systems (Egami score, Kobayashi score, and Sano score) for Kawasaki syndrome, high CRP level is globally considered a risk factor for non-responsiveness to IVIG and the subsequent risk of CAA in all systems, probably as a result of stronger systemic inflammation driving endothelial abnormalities and final development of cardiovascular complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. In addition, most scores have considered thrombocytopenia and patient’s age less than 6–12 months as individual risk factors for the occurrence of CAA. Damage to coronary arteries is still a substantial risk for a non-negligible percentage of children with KD, mostly in the cases showing resistance to IVIG 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>: the identification of this cohort of children at the time of first clinical assessment may help in discerning those who would benefit from a combined primary treatment with IVIG and corticosteroids.\n4.  4.\n    At the acute stage of KD, 50% patients present WBC >15 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L. As a result of increase of premature and mature neutrophil, leukopenia was rare. The convalescent stage was characterized by thrombocytosis (even more than 1000 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L), which gradually peaked on the third week after illness, then dropped to normal during the fourth week.

Some endosymbionts can be found either inside cells (intracellular), while others attach to the surface of cells (extracellular). Symbiotic relationships are ones in which both parties benefit. In the example of corals, the host animal is a multicellular cnidarian, and the endosymbiont is a unicellular alga called a dinoflagellate. The host animal serves as a protected environment, providing the alga with a constant supply of nutrients in the form of nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur. In turn, the alga provides the host with glucose. Another important example of a beneficial relationship between a host and an endosymbiont is found in the roots of bean and pea plants. Bacteria called rhizobia colonize the root cells of plants forming nodules. Rhizobia bacteria convert atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia that the plant can use to build biological molecules. The conversion of nitrogen gas into ammonium, requires large amounts of ATP. Plants supply the bacteria with carbohydrates to help drive the reaction.\n\n【4】▪ Explain how an alga endosymbiont could provide a host organism with glucose.\n\n【5】▪ Describe how a symbiotic relationship might alter an organism’s phenotype.\n\n【6】▪ What biological molecules require nitrogen?\n\n【7】▪ Connect the activity of nitrogen-fixing rhizobia bacteria to the global nitrogen cycle.\n\n【8】▪ The endosymbiotic theory explains the origin of mitochondria and chloroplasts.

        "text": "【0】Question: 4.1 The use of succinylcholine as an adjunct to general anesthetics during surgery is based on its ability to:\n\n【1】A. Block the action of ACh at the motor endplate\n\n【2】B. Increase release of ACh from autonomic ganglia\n\n【3】C. Increase release of histamine from mast cells\n\n【4】D. Inhibit cholinesterase\n\n【5】Answer: 4.1 A. Succinylcholine acts like ACh to cause depolarization of the muscle endplate. However, unlike ACh, succinylcholine is not metabolized at the synapse. Therefore, the endplate remains depolarized and unresponsive to endogenous ACh, resulting in muscle paralysis.\n\n【6】Question: 4.2 Continued exposure of muscle endplates to succinylcholine results in their:\n\n【7】A. Conversion to ion channels\n\n【8】B. Enhanced sensitivity to ACh\n\n【9】C. Regeneration of ACh receptors\n\n【10】D. Repolarization\n\n【11】Answer: 4.2 D. Continued exposure of the muscle endplate to succinylcholine results in desensitization (phase II block) where the endplate repolarizes but cannot readily be depolarized.\n\n【12】Question: 4.3 Cholinesterase inhibitors can reverse the action of which of the following?\n\n【13】A. Cisatracurium\n\n【14】B. Succinylcholine\n\n【15】C. Both A and B\n\n【16】D. Neither A nor B\n\n【17】Answer: 4.3 C. Cholinesterase inhibitors like neostigmine can effectively antagonize and reverse the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents and succinylcholine during phase II. However, they will augment the action of succinylcholine during phase I.\n\n【18】Question: 4.4 A 35-year-old man undergoes surgery for a hernia repair. After the surgery, he complains of diffuse muscle aches, which the anesthesiologist states is likely caused by the skeletal muscle relaxant. He has a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F). Which of the following is the most accurate statement?\n\n【19】A. The agent also commonly causes hypokalemia.\n\n【20】B. The agent blocks ACh at the nicotinic receptor.\n\n【21】C. The agent causes persistent endplate depolarization and desensitization.\n\n【22】D. The patient likely has malignant hyperthermia.\nAnswer: 4.4 C. Myalgia (muscle aches) is a common adverse reaction of depolarizing agents such as succinylcholine; these agents also may induce hyperkalemia and malignant hyperthermia.\n\n【23】PHARMACOLOGY PEARLS\n\n【24】 Malignant hyperthermia is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by tachycardia, muscle rigidity, and high body temperatures, which occurs when the patient is exposed to inhaled anesthetics in combination with muscle relaxants, usually succinylcholine.\n\n【25】 Dantrolene interferes with the release of intracellular calcium and is therefore used to treat the muscle rigidity and hyperthermia associated with malignant hyperthermia.\n\n【26】 The neuromuscular blocking agents are highly polar and highly ionized and, therefore, must be administered parenterally and have limited volume of distribution and limited access to the CNS.\n\n【27】 A small number of patients (1:10,000) with atypical cholinesterase experience long-lasting apnea of 1–4 hours following succinylcholine (or the nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drug mivacurium that is also eliminated by the action of butyrylcholinesterase). Mechanical ventilation is used to manage the apnea even though prescreening could detect this rare condition.\n\n【28】#",

Wu\n\n【10】</u>\n### Keywords\n\n【11】Psoriasis BCG vaccine Tuberculosis\n\n【12】Case\n----\n\n【13】47-year-old male, with an extensive history of psoriasis on his whole body for many years, presented with persistent erythematous plaques on bilateral lower legs. He had previously been on multiple medications for his psoriasis including methotrexate and acitretin. For the past 2–3 years, patient had been on etanercept 50 mg twice weekly. His psoriasis had mildly improved, but he continued to experience lesions on the legs, arms, and trunk. His last etanercept injection was the previous week. Patient had no history of psoriatic arthritis or injection site reactions. He denied any fevers, chills, night sweats, cough, hemoptysis, shortness of breath, leg edema, weakness, or numbness in the extremities. Of note, patient is Filipino and received the BCG vaccine as a child.\n\n【14】On physical examination , a total body skin check was performed with erythematous, scaly indurated papules and plaques visualized mostly on the bilateral lower legs and some on arms and trunk. The affected body surface area was approximately 6%.\n\n【15】Based on the clinical case description, what is the best treatment recommendation for this patient?\n\n【16】1.  1.\n    Start adalimumab\n2.  2.\n    Start topical steroids\n3.  3.\n    Start rifampin and isoniazid\n4.  4.\n    Start topical calcineurin inhibitor\n5.  5.\n    Continue etanercept\n\n【17】Treatment\n---------\n\n【18】Start adalimumab\n\n【19】Discussion\n----------\n\n【20】TNF-alpha is an inflammatory cytokine that plays an important role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis and is often the target of therapy in the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis involving more than 5% body surface area 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. TNF-alpha is also crucial in inhibiting viral replication and maintaining granulomas in tuberculosis (TB) infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. While TNF inhibitors have been successful in treating psoriasis, careful testing for latent and active tuberculosis infections is necessary, as incidence of TB infections have gone up with TNF inhibitor use 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】Mycobacterium tuberculosis is responsible for the transmission of TB infections through aerosolized inhalation. An inadequate pulmonary immune response that is unable to clear the mycobacterium via macrophages results in infection. The CDC estimates that one fourth of the world is infected with 1.7 million TB related deaths each year. In 2016, the United States experienced 9272 new TB cases, a 3.6% decrease from 2015.\n\n【22】Patients with latent TB infection are mostly asymptomatic as Mycobacterium are contained within granulomas, which prevents further replication of the bacteria and disease progression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Reactivation of latent TB from decreased host defenses can lead to extrapulmonary spread of the bacterium to multiple organ systems including the vertebra and kidney 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Risk factors for reactivation are multifactorial and include age, bacterial load, and immune compromise. TNF-alpha works on increasing phagocytic activity of macrophages and the formation of granulomas. Thus, use of TNF inhibitors can increase the risk of TB infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】All TNF inhibitors increase the risk of tuberculosis, although adalimumab and infliximab confer the highest risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. Prior to initiating a TNF inhibitor for psoriasis treatment, a thorough history and physical exam should be performed to rule out any TB infection. Epidemiologic risk factors should be taken into consideration along with performing a purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test or interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Patients with a positive PPD or IGRA should be followed up with a chest plain film to rule out active TB 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】Patients with a positive PPD or IGRA and negative plain film reading have a diagnosis of latent TB infection (LTBI) . Those with epidemiologic risk factors of TB exposure such as birth or travel to endemic area, occupation in homeless shelter or prison, occupation in healthcare settings, or contact with a patient with known active TB should be tested initially using IGRA as recommended by the CDC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Patients that have received BCG vaccine should also be initially tested with IGRA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. IGRA is preferred as initial screening test, as it is more sensitive and can be completed in one visit. It is also unnecessary to know a patient’s Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine history, which can cause a false positive PPD. Interestingly, there have been a few reported cases of patients developing psoriatic skin lesions following BCG vaccine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. For patients without risk factors for TB exposure and have not received the BCG vaccine, PPD skin test is a reasonable alternative test 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】Treatment\n---------\n\n【26】Patients with latent or active TB must be properly treated prior to initiating biologic therapy. For LTBI, 9 months of isoniazid in conjunction with vitamin B6, 4 months of rifampin, or 12 weeks of isoniazid plus rifapentine are the recommended treatments by the CDC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Those with active TB must defer biologic therapy and be referred to a specialist for treatment using standard multidrug therapy of rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol (RIPE).\n\n【27】Without proper screening or treatment of TB infections, potentially life threatening infections can occur for patients treated with TNF inhibitors. Adalimumab, etanercept, and infliximab all contain black box warnings for risk of disseminated and extrapulmonary tuberculosis. From 1998 to 2002 there were 54 cases per 100,000 people of infliximab associated TB infection and 28 cases per 100,000 people of etanercept associated TB infections in the United States 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Regarding adalimumab, a 5-year observational registry study demonstrated 18 cases of TB infection with 3 being active TB 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. These cases highlight the importance of thorough evaluation for TB risk factors and appropriate screening for LTBI. Patients with LTBI should not be started on TNF inhibitor therapy without receiving TB prophylaxis.\n\n【28】There are alternative treatments that are safe in the setting of TB infection. Narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) has been demonstrated to be effective for psoriasis affecting more than 10% body surface area and is not associated with TB reactivation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Screening for TB is therefore unnecessary and therapy can be administered safely. Other topical medications including corticosteroids, vitamin D analogs, and calcineurin inhibitors have also not been shown to increase risk of TB reactivation, although these treatments may be difficult to use in patients with psoriasis affecting more than 10% body surface area 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】Ustekinumab , an immunomodulator that works by blocking IL-12/IL-23, can also be considered as low risk for reactivation of TB. Safety data from five studies using ustekinumab showed 167 of 3177 patients having latent TB infection, but no cases of active TB were reported while patients were simultaneously receiving ustekinumab and isoniazid treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Ixekizumab and secukinumab , which act through inhibiting IL-17, have also not been shown to increase the risk of TB reactivation as seen from multiple studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 – 17 \\]</u>. However, both of these medications have been mandated by the FDA to include warnings of TB infection as cytokines play a vital role in immune response.\n\n【30】The patient from the clinical scenario previously received the BCG vaccine as a child. He was thoroughly examined and screened for history of tuberculosis and risk factors. Given his persistent psoriatic lesions on etanercept, treatment was switched to adalimumab 40 mg every other week. He was counseled to go to the emergency department if he experienced any symptoms of fever, cough, and hemoptysis.\n\n【31】Key Points\n----------\n\n【32】   Immunosuppressive therapy such as TNF inhibitors increase the risk of tuberculosis infection.\n   Patients should be screened for latent tuberculosis infection with a PPD skin test or IGRA. Those who have previously received BCG vaccine should have an IGRA due to the chance of false positives.\n   Patients diagnosed with latent TB and are at high risk of reactivation should either begin TB treatment prior to starting any immunosuppressive therapy or consider other safer forms of psoriasis treatment.\n\n【33】###",

        "text": "【0】CASE 59: KNEE PAIN IN AN ATHLETE\n\n【1】History\n\n【2】A 36-year-old recreational runner presents with anterior knee pain. She has recently  删除换行1 increased training in preparation for a marathon and runs exclusively on roads. A few  删除换行1 weeks prior to presentation she developed crescendo knee pain while running which  删除换行1 did not resolve when she stopped. The pain is now also present at rest. She is otherwise  删除换行1 well with no previous injuries but did experience 8 months of secondary amenorrhoea  删除换行1 due to overtraining in her early twenties. Since then her periods have been normal. She  删除换行1 does not smoke or drink and is on no regular medication although she has been taking  删除换行1 paracetamol for the pain.\n\n【3】Examination\n\n【4】This patient has a normal gait but is unable to hop on the affected side because of the  删除换行1 pain. There is an area of focal bony tenderness in the medial proximal tibia. Examination  删除换行1 of her knee and other joints is normal.\n\n【5】Questions\n\n【6】• What is the likely diagnosis?\n\n【7】• What is the investigation of choice?\n\n【8】• What is the differential diagnosis of anterior knee pain?\n\n【9】• How would you manage this patient?\n\n【10】ANSWER 59\n\n【11】The most likely diagnosis is a stress fracture of the proximal tibia. Stress fractures are  删除换行1 overuse injuries and occur when periosteal resorption exceeds bone formation. They are  删除换行1 commonly seen in two main patient groups: soldiers may suffer so-called march fractures  删除换行1 in the metatarsals, while athletes may develop them in different sites according to their  删除换行1 sporting activity. Although the knee is a common site in runners due to excess mechanical loading, stress fractures may also result in non-weight-bearing sites due to repetitive  删除换行1 and excessive traction (e.g. rib fractures in rowers due to traction from serratus anterior).\nThe classic symptom – as in this case – is of pain that occurs throughout running and  删除换行1 crucially persists with rest; this is in contrast to shin splints, a traction injury to the  删除换行1 tibial periosteum in which the pain diminishes somewhat with continued activity, only  删除换行1 to return again after the patient has stopped running.\n\n【12】The investigation of choice is CT or MRI as radiographs are frequently normal.\n\n【13】The differential diagnosis of anterior knee pain is extensive and includes:\n\n【14】• patellar maltracking and malalignment\n\n【15】• chondromalacia patellae (a degenerative condition of patellar cartilage)\n\n【16】• patellar tendinopathy\n\n【17】• pre- or infrapatellar bursitis\n\n【18】• meniscal damage\n\n【19】• tight iliotibial band\n\n【20】• referred pain from the hip or lumbosacral spine.\n\n【21】The management of stress fractures is rest until the pain has completely settled and  删除换行1 focal tenderness has resolved. For those with severe stress fractures in the lower limb,  删除换行1 an air-cast boot can offer support and assist in a gradual resumption of weight-bearing.\nThe crucial feature of rehabilitation is a graded return to sport to prevent progression or  删除换行1 recurrence. Patients with stress fractures should also undergo a thorough physiotherapy  删除换行1 assessment to identify and treat any predisposing biomechanical factors. In addition this  删除换行1 patient already has a history of overtraining and so one should remain alert for the development of the ‘female athlete triad’ of disordered eating, amenorrhoea and osteoporosis.\nMany physicians would screen any stress fracture patient with a clinical assessment of  删除换行1 osteoporosis risk followed by a DEXA scan and assessment of serological bone profile  删除换行1 (calcium, alkaline phosphatase and vitamin D status).\n\n【22】KEY POINTS\n\n【23】• Stress fractures are overuse injuries and common in athletes.\n\n【24】• Patients with stress fractures should be assessed for osteoporosis.\n\n【25】• Consider the female athlete triad in any woman with a stress fracture.\n\n【26】删除测试2：<u>Rheumatology\n\n【27】</u>",

        "text": "【0】### Session 2\n\n【1】In session 2, the therapist reviewed the self-monitoring log with Emily and completed a functional analysis 删除33：<u></u>. Emily noted that her focused picking most often occurred when she felt anxious, angry, or bored; in the morning before showering; and in the evening after getting home from work and during her bedtime preparations. In these situations, Emily reported that she would go to the bathroom and lean into the mirror, looking for “good spots” to pick. Picking targets most frequently included irregularities in the skin, including clogged pores, bumps, dried skin, and scars or scabs from previous picking episodes. Following most picking episodes, the therapist noted that Emily reported feeling not only “calmer” and “relieved” but also sometimes ashamed or annoyed with herself. The therapist drew a simple functional analysis diagram, showing that certain emotions (e.g. anxiety) and behaviors (e.g. leaning into the mirror) led to an increased urge to pick, which was then reduced by completing the picking. The therapist also noted that scabs and open lesions from picking episodes might increase Emily’s “touching” behavior and mirror checking, while the shame that resulted from picking increased her negative affect and might make her more vulnerable to future picking episodes.\n\n【2】删除3：<u>Fig. 19.2\n\n【3】Sample functional analysis</u>\n\n【4】To increase Emily’s awareness of her picking behaviors, the therapist then assisted Emily in completing a more detailed, step-by-step chain analysis. Emily identified feeling stressed and anxious after a difficult day at work as a strong vulnerability factor. Contexts that increased the likelihood of picking included being home alone, feeling anxious or lonely, or noticing a “bump” on her skin (usually after face touching or inspection in the mirror). Other prompting events included automatically touching or picking the skin on her face, neck, arms, and chest. These contexts created a strong “urge” to pick. In response to this urge, Emily would go to the bathroom and closely examine her face in the mirror. Sometimes, she would disinfect the identified area with alcohol prior to picking. She then squeezed and picked her skin until she felt satisfied (often following the dislodging of sebum or pus) or until she “gave up” on an area, at which point she would search for a new target. Immediate, short-term consequences of picking were a mixture of feelings of relief, satisfaction, shame, and self-directed anger. Emily was also able to identify long-term negative consequences, including patches of dry skin (from harsh disinfectants), shame, anxiety, and increased use of heavy makeup. Emily agreed that these consequences likely perpetuated her picking. For homework, Emily was given another copy of the monitoring form and a chain analysis handout to complete at home.\n\n【5】### Session 3\n\n【6】In session 3, the therapist first reviewed the self-monitoring and chain analysis forms. In the remainder of the session, the therapist and Emily jointly identified stimulus control and competing response techniques. Stimulus control techniques, which Emily was instructed to use whenever possible, included turning the bathroom lights off during her bedtime routine and using stall bathrooms rather than individual bathrooms at work (Emily reported reluctance to pick in public bathrooms due to the fear that a coworker would see her). The therapist recommended that Emily place a sticker on her mirror to remind her not to “zoom in.” Emily was also encouraged to wear gloves during sedentary activities to reduce time spent touching her face; however, she did not agree to this recommendation because she was concerned it would “make her look stupid.” Competing response techniques, which Emily was instructed to use in response to picking urges, included sitting on her hands, making a fist, combing her cat, and preparing a meal. The social support component of habit reversal training was also introduced: Emily was encouraged to talk to her partner or post on the forum for an online skin-picking support group when she had an urge to pick.\n\n【7】For homework, Emily was instructed to practice her stimulus control and competing response techniques. Emily was also given a self-monitoring form and a copy of the SPS and SPIS to complete and bring to the next session.\n\n【8】### Session 4\n\n【9】In session 4, the therapist first reviewed Emily’s self-monitoring log and self-report measures. Her SPS score was 14 and her SPIS score was 27, representing a decrease from baseline of 26 and 13 %, respectively. Emily reported noticing a decrease in focused picking, including picking only two to three times most days, picking for shorter durations, and one pick-free day (Emily’s first pick-free day in several months). Emily was surprised and pleased to discover that her efforts had been successful, although she was disappointed that she was not able to stop picking completely. The therapist congratulated Emily on her progress and on her hard work and normalized her struggle and frustration.\n\n【10】Emily reported that she found placing reminders on her mirror to be particularly helpful in preventing picking episodes. However, she still struggled to resist strong picking urges, particularly with respect to scabs on her face (which were visible from a distance), dried skin, and urges that accompanied anger and anxiety. Therefore, the remainder of the session focused on relaxation training (e.g. diaphragmatic breathing, which was practiced in session) and identifying distress tolerance techniques. Emily had some familiarity with mindfulness (i.e. intentionally and nonjudgmentally shifting the focus of attention to what is happening in the present moment, thereby increasing awareness of emotions, urges, and behaviors) as a result of completing mindfulness-based yoga classes at the gym. The therapist therefore suggested that Emily apply her mindfulness skills to other activities that would distract or soothe her in times of distress (e.g. mindfully savoring a special treat or taking a bath).\n\n【11】For homework, Emily was asked to brainstorm and introduce other competing responses and ways to keep her hands busy. The self-monitoring log was expanded to include successful attempts to resist picking, including which techniques Emily had successfully employed to combat the urge to pick.\n\n【12】### Session 5\n\n【13】The session began with a review of the past week’s self-monitoring log. Emily reported that her focused and automatic skin picking continued to decrease. For the focused picking, Emily noted that exercising was a helpful alternative to managing her negative affect and urges to pick. Emily noted that while she was able to decrease the overall frequency of the skin picking, the stronger urges remained difficult to control.\n\n【14】Emily expressed difficulty using competing responses for automatic picking, given her lowered awareness at that time. Based on the monitoring log, Emily’s high-risk situations for automatic picking included talking on the telephone and driving. Emily was therefore encouraged to implement stimulus-control strategies during these times (e.g. driving with both hands on the wheel). She was also encouraged to engage in mindfulness in these high-risk situations. Contingency management was also introduced as a strategy to help Emily further reduce her focused picking. Emily was asked to identify “treats” that she valued and use these as rewards for meeting behavioral goals. Emily’s behavioral goals included multiple consecutive pick-free days and consistent use of stimulus control and competing response techniques. Reward contingencies included purchasing a gentle “luxury” face cleanser that Emily enjoyed, a new sweater, a new computer game, and a ski trip with her partner.\n\n【15】For homework, the therapist instructed Emily to complete the self-monitoring log, continue stimulus control and competing response techniques, and practice mindfulness skills. She was also asked to complete the SPS and SPIS.\n\n【16】### Sessions 6–8\n\n【17】At the beginning of session 6, Emily’s SPS and SPIS scores were 8 and 20, representing decreases from baseline of 58 and 35 %, respectively. The therapist began sessions 6–8 by reviewing Emily’s self-monitoring logs. During these reviews, Emily was asked to identify particular situations and coping strategies that led to increases or decreases in picking urges and behaviors. Emily reported an overall decrease in picking over the course of these sessions, as well as increases in her number of total and consecutive days free from picking. Emily also noted that her automatic picking at home reduced when she began knitting again, an activity that she had enjoyed in early adulthood but which she had discontinued in recent years. Emily reported that knitting was distracting and kept her hands busy; she was also pleased to be able to gift the products to loved ones. By session 8, she was pick-free more days than not, with one period of five consecutive pick-free days (her longest stretch in “years”).\n\n【18】However, some “slips” were observed, particularly during times of stress (following an argument with her partner or family and upon being rejected from a job for which she interviewed). Emily often became angry with herself following these slips. Cognitive interventions to reduce black-and-white thinking (e.g. challenging Emily’s belief that a single picking episode “undid” her previous success) were particularly helpful in reducing this anger. Although Emily wished to be entirely pick-free, she was ultimately able to acknowledge her considerable progress since beginning treatment.\n\n【19】Additional interventions during these sessions included motivational interviewing 删除10：<u>(Miller and Rollnick 2013 )</u>, mindfulness exercises, and distress tolerance coaching. Motivational interviewing techniques, including “rolling with resistance,” eliciting change talk, and planning behavioral changes, were used to sustain Emily’s commitment to treatment, particularly when she became frustrated with her “slips.” Emily was reminded to apply the mindfulness and distress tolerance skills reviewed in session 5 during high-risk situations (e.g. while driving; when she noticed a “bump” or clogged pore; following arguments with her partner or family). Emily agreed to continue practicing these skills, as she found them moderately helpful.\n\n【20】At the beginning of session 8, Emily reported an SPS score of 9 and SPIS score of 16, which corresponded to a slight increase from session 6 (attributable in part to life stress during week 7) but a decrease from baseline of 53 and 48 %, respectively. The final session was scheduled for 2 weeks later. Emily was given an additional battery of self-report measures to complete and bring to the final session.\n\n【21】### Session 9\n\n【22】Session 9 occurred 2 weeks after session 8 and was designed as a consolidation and relapse prevention session. Emily was asked to develop a list of skills, techniques, and observations that she had found particularly helpful in reducing her picking. Emily noted that stimulus-control techniques (especially dimming bathroom lights and placing reminders around her home) had been particularly helpful for her, as had distress tolerance techniques (e.g. taking a walk, knitting, talking with her partner and friends). Emily was also asked to list positive outcomes that she had noticed from implementing these strategies. These included healthier skin, reduced makeup (which she reported that her partner found more attractive), higher self-confidence, and reduced guilt and shame. Emily was encouraged to review this list frequently (at least weekly and whenever she had an urge to pick). Emily was also encouraged to continue her involvement in online support groups for skin picking.\n\n【23】Emily’s self-report measures revealed a significant decrease in skin picking, with SPS and SPIS scores of 6 and 13, corresponding to a decrease of 68 and 58 %, respectively 删除33：<u></u>. Emily’s SPS score placed her below the clinical cutoff 删除10：<u>(Keuthen et al. 2001b )</u>. Emily also evidenced a significant decrease in depression symptoms (BDI-II = 16) and some decrease in worry (PSWQ = 57). However, she still experienced interference and distress as a result of these symptoms. Emily was therefore referred to a therapist known to our clinic who specialized in CBT for emotional disorders and emotional dysregulation. This therapist was also competent in skin-picking treatment.\n\n【24】删除3：<u>Fig. 19.3\n\n【25】Skin picking severity over treatment. SPS Skin-Picking Scale, SPIS Skin-Picking Impact Scale</u>\n\n【26】Emily reported that she was highly satisfied with her skin-picking treatment. Her self-report measures and subjective ratings reflected considerable improvement in her skin-picking symptoms, and she scored below the clinical significance cutoff on one self-report skin-picking measure. Emily was highly motivated to continue improving her skin-picking symptoms and was invited to recontact our clinic if she experienced a relapse that she did not feel equipped to manage independently.\n\n【27】Complicating Factors\n--------------------\n\n【28】Emily’s case was characterized by several complicating factors. First, Emily met diagnostic criteria for OCPD. Correspondingly, she presented with significant black-and-white thinking and rigidity regarding several treatment recommendations. For example, she refused a consultation with a psychiatrist. Had Emily presented with more severe or treatment-resistant psychopathology, additional cognitive interventions may have been necessary to increase her willingness to consider psychoactive medication. Additionally, Emily initially refused several dermatological recommendations (e.g. discontinuing her use of heavy makeup). However, Emily was amenable to other recommendations to reduce the likelihood of infection, including using more gentle approaches to disinfecting her skin and switching to a gentle, pH-balanced cleanser and moisturizer. Finally, Emily refused several stimulus-control techniques (e.g. wearing gloves) for fear that these would make her look “unprofessional” or “stupid.” As such, Emily continued to engage in some automatic picking until she and her therapist ultimately developed a more acceptable stimulus-control technique for her to use at home (knitting).\n\n【29】Additional black-and-white thinking was observed in Emily’s reaction to “slips” (usually focused picking episodes), particularly following a streak of several pick-free days. Following these slips, Emily became angry with herself for “undoing” her considerable progress. Cognitive interventions focused on identifying and challenging Emily’s black-and-white distortions were necessary to help Emily place her “slips” in the context of her (much more significant) progress in treatment.\n\n【30】Emily’s case was also characterized by subthreshold features of BPD, including impulsivity, emotion dysregulation, and fears of abandonment. These features occasionally impeded the therapy dynamic, as Emily would sometimes become irritable or impatient with the therapist or treatment. During treatment, Emily was more likely to engage in severe focused picking episodes during periods of distress. Emily also picked more following arguments with her partner and family members, which may have reflected her difficulty tolerating disruptions in these relationships. The therapist worked with Emily to help her realize the connections between arguments with loved ones and picking behavior. DBT strategies, including breathing exercises and distress tolerance skills (e.g. distraction, self-soothing) appeared moderately useful in helping Emily manage her emotions and resist the urge to pick on these occasions. Emily was also encouraged to use these skills following severe picking episodes to regulate her emotions.\n\n【31】Emily also experienced some mild life disruptions during the course of treatment, including applying and interviewing for several new jobs, which she was not offered. These disappointments exacerbated Emily’s anxiety and depression, which resulted in more severe and damaging picking. Distress tolerance techniques were only modestly helpful on these occasions. Although Emily’s depression and anxiety were moderately reduced following her skin-picking treatment, she and the therapist agreed that referral to another cognitive-behavioral therapist was warranted to improve Emily’s overall well-being and improve her ability to tolerate and regulate her distress.\n\n【32】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【33】Emily was a 33-year-old Caucasian woman with excoriation (skin-picking) disorder who was successfully treated with nine sessions of CBT over 11 weeks. Treatment incorporated a combination of several cognitive-behavioral interventions, including psychoeducation, awareness training, habit reversal training, stimulus control, cognitive restructuring, contingency management, and DBT skills. Emily reported clinically significant reductions in skin-picking frequency, intensity, and impact, with reductions of 68 and 58 % reported on the SPS and SPIS, respectively 删除33：<u></u>.\n\n【34】The heterogeneous and complex presentation of this disorder is reflected in the present case. In our clinical experience, oftentimes it is necessary to combine traditional habit reversal training with other cognitive-behavioral interventions (e.g. cognitive restructuring, distress tolerance skills) to manage comorbid psychiatric symptoms that may contribute to picking behaviors or interfere with treatment. A thorough assessment at the outset of treatment is critical to accurately identify the reinforcement contingencies that maintain the picking, as well as any other factors (e.g. comorbid psychopathology) that may complicate treatment. Ongoing assessment throughout treatment is also necessary to continually tailor the treatment course for each patient. Given the present dearth of treatment efficacy data, randomized controlled trials of cognitive-behavioral therapy for excoriation (skin-picking) disorder are warranted.\n\n【35】Key Practice Points\n-------------------\n\n【36】   Conduct a thorough assessment to provide an accurate differential diagnosis and identify potentially complicating comorbid psychopathologies.\n   Recommend the patient to consult with a dermatologist to identify any infections or skin damage that may require medical attention.\n   Provide detailed psychoeducation regarding the nature of excoriation disorder, potential tissue damage associated with picking, and a rationale for treatment.\n   Develop a behaviorally oriented treatment plan tailored to the individual needs of the patient.\n   Continuously assess skin-picking symptoms to tailor the treatment plan and establish whether medical intervention (e.g. to treat infections) is warranted.",

The DNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and then sequenced. The region of the sequencing gel where the normal gene differs from the mutated gene is shown in the image. Which of the following types of DNA mutations caused this disease?\n删除个例：<u>> Reproduced, with permission, from USMLERx.com.</u>\n> (A) Deletion mutation\n\n【1】> (B) Frameshift mutation\n\n【2】> (C) Insertion mutation\n\n【3】> (D) Missense mutation\n\n【4】> (E) Nonsense mutation\n\n【5】> (F) Silent mutation\n\n【6】> (G) Transition\n\n【7】 Answer: The correct answer is A. This is a deletion mutation. Bases 7-9 of the normal gene have been deleted in the mutant gene, resulting in the subsequent loss of one amino acid. Because three nucleotides were deleted, there is no change in the reading frame. The most common cystic fibrosis mutation, ΔF508, does in fact yield gene product three nucleotides shorter than the normal gene product.  \nAnswer B is incorrect. A frameshift mutation is an insertion or deletion of nucleotides that results in a misreading of all codons downstream. Deletions or insertions in multiples of three do not cause a shift in the reading frame.  \nAnswer C is incorrect. An insertion mutation is an addition of one or more nucleotides to the DNA.  \nAnswer D is incorrect. A missense mutation occurs when a point mutation causes one amino acid in a protein to be replaced by a different amino acid.  \nAnswer E is incorrect. A nonsense mutation occurs when a point mutation results in an early stop codon. This type of mutation causes a truncated protein.  \nAnswer F is incorrect. A silent mutation occurs when a point mutation does not change the amino acid sequence of the protein. The point mutation is often in the third position of the codon.  \nAnswer G is incorrect. A transition is a mutation in which a nucleotide is replaced by another nucleotide of the same type (ie, purine for purine, or pyrimidine for pyrimidine). Purine-for-pyrimidine and pyrimidine-for-purine substitutions are called transversions.",

        "text": "【0】CASE 63: CHICKEN POX EXPOSURE IN PREGNANCY\n\n【1】A woman has telephoned the antenatal clinic for advice. She is 16 weeks’ gestation in her  删除换行1 second pregnancy. She took her son to a birthday party yesterday and has been telephoned  删除换行1 now by the party host to say that one of the other children at the party has just developed a  删除换行1 typical chicken pox rash.\n\n【2】She is worried about the effect of chicken pox on her pregnancy.\n\n【3】Questions\n\n【4】• What, if any, further questions do you need to ask her?\n\n【5】• What investigations should be performed?\n\n【6】• How will you advise and manage the case depending on the investigation results?\n\n【7】ANSWER 63\n\n【8】Chicken pox (caused by varicella zoster virus) is a very common, highly contagious and generally self-limiting mild childhood illness, mostly spread by respiratory droplets. Ninety per cent  删除换行1 of antenatal women will have been previously infected with chicken pox and immunity can  删除换行1 be demonstrated by the presence of varicella zoster virus (VZV) IgG antibodies in the serum.\n\n【9】Questions to be asked\n\n【10】• Does the woman know whether she has had chicken pox before?\n\n【11】• What was the nature of her contact with the affected child?\n\n【12】• What was the duration of her contact with the affected child?\n\n【13】When asked she can’t remember whether or not she had chicken pox as a child. It was an  删除换行1 indoor party and she herself had stayed at the party with her son for about 30 minutes.\n\n【14】Investigations to be performed\n\n【15】In many cases, a blood sample will have been retained from the antenatal booking blood tests  删除换行1 that can be tested for VZV immunoglobulin (IgG). Otherwise the woman should be asked  删除换行1 to have blood taken urgently for VZV IgG (ideally taken at the general practitioner’s practice  删除换行1 so that she does not attend the antenatal clinic and potentially infect other non-immune  删除换行1 pregnant women).\n\n【16】Advice and management\n\n【17】If the serum varicella IgG is positive then immunity is confirmed and the woman can be  删除换行1 reassured that neither she nor her fetus is at risk of infection.\n\n【18】Maternal risks\n\n【19】If the IgG is negative then she is not immune and more than 15 minutes in the same room  删除换行1 as the infected individual is sufficient to place her at risk of infection. She should be given  删除换行1 varicella immunoglobulin VZIG as soon as possible (effective if given up to 10 days after contact). She should then be advised that she is still potentially infectious and to avoid any other  删除换行1 pregnant women during the infectious period of 8–28 days after exposure.\n\n【20】The risk of maternal varicella to the mother is greater than in the mild childhood form of  删除换行1 the illness. Pneumonia, encephalitis and hepatitis are the potential complications. Maternal  删除换行1 death is reported in 1 per cent of affected pregnant women (five times higher than in nonpregnant women). If she is infected then the rash would be expected to appear within 1–3  删除换行1 weeks. She must be advised to seek medical attention at the outset of a rash developing and  删除换行1 should be prescribed acyclovir orally at the start of symptoms. She must be referred to hospital for supportive care and intravenous acyclovir if chest symptoms, neurological symptoms  删除换行1 or a haemorrhagic rash occurs.\n\n【21】Fetal risks\n\n【22】The risk of miscarriage is not increased in women who develop chicken pox in the first trimester. However fetal varicella syndrome (skin scarring, limb hypoplasia and neurological  删除换行1 abnormalities) may occur in 1 per cent of fetuses of women infected up to 28 weeks, as a result  删除换行1 of herpes zoster reactivation after the initial infection. Specialist fetal medicine ultrasound  删除换行1 5 weeks after initial infection may detect the anatomical abnormalities. If infection occurs  删除换行1 before 12 weeks’ gestation the chance of varicella syndrome is much lower.Case 63: Chicken pox exposure in pregnancy\n\n【23】Maternal infection at term carries the risk of varicella of the newborn which is a severe  删除换行1 infection with up to 30 per cent mortality if untreated. The risk is approximately 30 per  删除换行1 cent in infants of mothers infected 1–4 weeks before delivery, with highest risk conferred if  删除换行1 infection is within 7 days of delivery. If possible delivery should therefore be delayed until  删除换行1 after recovery from maternal infection to allow transplacental transfer of maternal antibodies to the fetus. VZIG should be given to the susceptible neonate.\n\n【24】If the woman is non-immune but does not develop the infection then vaccination should be  删除换行1 recommended after delivery.\n\n【25】KEY POINTS\n\n【26】• Chicken pox in pregnancy is potentially much more severe than in nonpregnant  删除换行1 adults, with maternal death reported in up to 1 per cent of affected women.\n\n【27】• VZV is spread by respiratory droplets with same room contact for more than 15  删除换行1 minutes considered to place a nonimmune woman at high risk.\n\n【28】• VZIgG should be given as soon as possible after exposure.\n\n【29】• Fetal risks of maternal chicken pox infection are fetal varicella syndrome (if mother  删除换行1 infected before 28 weeks) or varicella of the newborn (if mother infected 1–4 weeks  删除换行1 before delivery).\n删除测试1：<u>Case 64: Bleeding in pregnancy\n\n【30】</u>",

He is brought into the accident and emergency department as a trauma  删除换行1 call. He was sitting in the rear of the car in the central passenger seat restrained by an  删除换行1 old-style ‘lap belt’, unlike the other passengers who were wearing standard shoulder and  删除换行1 lap belts. He was thrown forward into the seat in front. He was conscious throughout but  删除换行1 is complaining of severe pain in the lower thoracic and lumbar spine.\n\n【3】Examination\n\n【4】Primary survey is unremarkable and his observations are stable. There is marked tenderness over the lower thoracic and lumbar spine. On neurological examination of the  删除换行1 lower limbs there are no motor or sensory abnormalities.

Chance  删除换行1 in 1948. It consists of a compression injury to the anterior portion of the vertebral body  删除换行1 and a transverse fracture through the posterior elements of the vertebra and the posterior  删除换行1 portion of the vertebral body. It is caused by violent forward flexion, causing distraction  删除换行1 injury to the posterior elements.\nChance fractures later became known as ‘seatbelt’ fractures with the advent of lap seatbelts in cars. A head-on collision would cause the passenger wearing a lap belt to suddenly be flexed at the waist, hence creating significant stress on the posterior elements of  删除换行1 the vertebra. From the 1980s when shoulder and lap belts became more common in cars  删除换行5 Chance fractures have become less associated with road traffic accidents and are more  删除换行1 commonly seen with falls or crush-type injuries where the thorax is acutely hyperflexed.\n\n【10】The most common site at which Chance fractures occur is the thoracolumbar junction and  删除换行1 mid-lumbar region in paediatric populations.\n\n【11】An anterior–posterior (AP) view of the spine may reveal disruption of the pedicles and  删除换行1 loss of vertebral body height. Frequently a transverse process fracture will be identified  删除换行1 on AP projection. The lateral view will demonstrate the spinous process fracture and fractures through the laminae and pedicles. The vertebral body will usually look compressed  删除换行1 and wedge shaped.\n\n【12】CT of the spine should be performed on all Chance fractures to assess the extent of the  删除换行1 fracture and to evaluate the spinal canal. Sagittal reconstructions of the axial images  删除换行1 provide a great deal of information about the fracture pattern. Posterior element fractures  删除换行1 are better seen on lateral projection, although the AP view helps to demonstrate pedicle  删除换行1 involvement.\nUp to 50 per cent of Chance fractures have associated intra-abdominal injuries, including fractures of the pancreas, contusions or lacerations of the duodenum and mesenteric  删除换行1 contusions or lacerations.\n\n【13】 KEY POINTS\n\n【14】• The incidence of associated intra-abdominal injuries with a Chance fracture reaches  删除换行1 50 per cent. Therefore, when a Chance fracture is diagnosed a CT of the abdomen  删除换行1 should be obtained.\n\n【15】• Injuries associated with Chance fractures include fractures of the pancreas, duodenum  删除换行1 and mesentery contusions/rupture.",

NK cells are lymphocytes of innate immunity that are activated to kill virus-infected cells by recognizing alterations in the MHC molecules on their surface. NK cells carry numerous activating and inhibitory receptors that between them control the cells cytotoxicity. In contrast， the T-cell receptors on cytotoxic CD8+T lymphocytes specifically recognize viral antigens presented on the infected cell's surface by MHC class I molecules. Antigen binding by the T-cell receptor activates the cytotoxic T cell. Despite the differences in recognition mechanisms， both these cell types kill their targets in the same way-by release of the cytotoxic proteins perforin， granzyme B， and granulysin onto the target cell 删除33：<u></u>. Perforin forms multimeric pores in the cell membranes that enable the delivery of the other cytotoxic proteins from the killer cell into the target.\n\n【4】Cytotoxic proteins are preformed and stored in endosomal ‘lytic granules' within the lymphocyte. Once activated， cytotoxic lymphocytes reorient the microtubule-organizing center of the cell toward the point of contact with the target， and this cytoskeletal rearrangement guides the lytic granules to the contact point. After the lytic granules dock at the cell membrane， perforin polymerizes and inserts into the 删除换行1 activation 删除换行4 membrane of the target cell， thus forming pores that connect the killer and target cells. Granzyme B and granulysin are released through the pore into the target cell， where they induce apoptosis 删除33：<u></u>.\n删除3：<u>Fig. 14.1 Intracellular trafficking of lytic granules and genetic defects that can lead to hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis(HLH). On activation， cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and NK cells mobilize lytic granules filled with cytotoxic proteins that are transported toward the point of contact between the lymphocyte and the target cell， where they dock with the membrane. This is followed by the exocytosis of granule contents and the release of cytotoxic proteins through pores formed by perforin. Different steps of this process are impaired in the forms of familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHL) for which the genetic defect is known (FHL 2，3， 4， and 5) and in another disease in which HLH is a symptom (Griscelli syndrome type 2)； the protein deficient in each disease is shown next to each form of FHL. A deficiency in perforin does not affect the formation of the cytolytic granules but impairs the release of the cytotoxins and their entry into the target cell.</u>\n\n【5】Several other proteins apart from the cytotoxins are crucial to successful cell-mediated cytotoxicity. The small GTPase Rab27a promotes the docking of mature cytotoxic granules to the cell membrane. The Munc13-4 protein promotes priming of the cytolytic granules； finally， syntaxin-11 and Munc18-2 (both are part of the docking complex) enable fusion of the secretory granules with the cell membrane删除33：<u></u>. Cytotoxic proteins may then be released by exocytosis through the pores formed by perforin.\n\n【6】The process of degranulation can be detected by the appearance of lysosomal-membrane-associated glycoproteins on the cell membrane. In particular， surface expression of one such protein (CD107a) is often used to detect release of lytic granules (degranulation) by activated cytotoxic T cells and NK lymphocytes. Under resting conditions， CD107a is located on the inner surface of the lytic granule mem-brane； upon degranulation， it becomes exposed on the lymphocyte surface.\n\n【7】Several genetic defects that affect the cytotoxic machinery and cause disease in humans have been identified.

At 2 months of age he developed rhinorrhea (‘running nose') and fever. Seven days later he was referred to the emergency room with a high fever (39.5℃) and difficulty in feeding.His physical examination showed significant enlargement of the liver and the spleen， which were both palpable 4 cm below the costal edge.\n\n【11】A complete blood count showed marked lymphocytosis (29，000 ul-1)， thrombo-cytopenia (platelet count 73，000 ul-l； normal 150，000-300，000 uF)， and anemia(hemoglobin (Hb) 6.2 g dl-1； normal 9.0-14.0 g dl-1). Spinal fluid sampled by lumbar puncture showed mild pleocytosis (increased white blood cell count). Laboratory investigations revealed increased levels of liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase(ALT) 375 U F-1； aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 220 U I)， markedly high ferritin(7500 ng ul-1； normal 50-200 ng ul-)， positive C-reactive protein， and elevated fibrin degradation products.\n\n【12】Serological tests for Epstein-Barr virus， cytomegalovirus， and adenovirus were all negative. Although blood cultures were negative， Jude was treated with intravenous antibiotics (ampicillin and amikacin)， but his condition continued to worsen， and his consciousness rapidly deteriorated. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with T2 intensity revealed spotty high-density lesions in the white matter of the cer-ebrum， basal nuclei， and cerebellum. Laboratory investigations showed a worsening of anemia (Hb 5.2 g di-1) and thrombocytopenia (31，000ul-1)， but also high serum levels of triglycerides (750 mg dl-1； normal value less than 150 mg dl-1) and low fibrinogen (40 mg dl-1； normal value 200-400 mg dl-1). Bone marrow aspiration was performed and showed hypocellularity with an increased number of large granu-lar lymphocytes and macrophages with hemophagocytic activity. Jude was diag-nosed with HLH. Flow cytometry analysis revealed an absence of perforin. Complete absence of NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity was demonstrated using a suitable target(K562) cell line. Sequence analysis of the perforin gene revealed a single nucleo-tide deletion in exon 2， resulting in a frameshift and the production of an amino-terminally truncated perforin protein that could not be detected by flow cytometry analysis. Both parents were heterozygous for the same mutation.\n\n【13】Jude received chemotherapy according to the HLH-94 protocol， which consisted of dexamethazone， etoposide， and cyclosporin A (CsA). He subsequently underwent matched unrelated hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) with a reduced intensity conditioning regimen based on fludarabine， melphalan， and alemtuzumab(a monoclonal antibody directed against CD52， which is expressed by mature lym-phocytes but not by stem cells)， and CsA and methylprednisolone for graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis. Three years after HSCT， Jude is doing well， with mild men-tal and motor delay in his development.\n\n【14】Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.\n\n【15】The case of Jude Fawley illustrates the typical features of HLH. Both congenital and acquired forms of HLH are known； Jude had the congenital form， which is often known as FHL. Acquired HLH may be secondary to infections， malignancies， or autoimmune diseases. In particular， patients with juvenile arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus can develop a disease similar to HLH， called macrophage activation syndrome. HLHis an aggressive and potentially life-threatening disease.\n\n【16】FHL is a rare disorder， with an estimated frequency of 1 in 50，000 births in the United States. The disease typically appears in infancy or early childhood； both\n\n【17】Coagulopathy and markedly ritin. inireaser 删除换行1 nagocyvttosis in the\n\n【18】Hemopi\n\n【19】NK-cell bone marrow；10 删除换行1 sexes are affected， which is consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance. The clinical presentation is characterized by high and persistent fever， and spleen and liver enlargement. Neurological manifestations (ranging from seizures and confu-sion to coma) are common and are associated with pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid， also known as lymphocytic meningitis. Patients develop severe anemia and thrombocytopenia， abnormal liver function， and coagulopathy (decreased fibrino-gen and increased levels of fibrin degradation products， which make the blood less able to clot). Increased levels of serum triglycerides and of inflammatory markers(ferritin and C-reactive protein) are also observed.\n\n【20】These manifestations are the consequence of the defect in lymphocyte cytotoxic-ity that makes patients with HLH unable to kill virus-infected cells. In this situa-tion， there is continuous activation of NK cells and CD8+ T lymphocytes， which infiltrate the liver， spleen， bone marrow， and central nervous system and secrete high amounts of IFN-y. This cytokine is a potent activator of macrophages， which are induced to secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-C. The hemophagocytosis-the phagocytic destruction of red blood cells-is also a con-sequence of macrophage activation 删除33：<u></u>. An increase in serum levels of the soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R) is also characteristic of HLH during active phases of the disease， and is a marker of T-cell activation.\n\n【21】In FHL， the clinical symptoms of fever， immune activation， and increased inflam-mation are precipitated especially by infections with herpesviruses， such as cyto-megalovirus， Epstein-Barr virus， and varicella-zoster virus. These episodes are known as the ‘accelerated phase of the disease. They can lead to multiple organ failure and death， and can occur multiple times in a patient's life.\n\n【22】At least five variants of FHL are known 删除33：<u></u>， and the underlying genetic defect is known in four of them. Jude had FHL2， and was unable to produce a func-tional perforin. Some forms of HLH (Griscelli syndrome type 2， Chediak-Higashi syndrome， and Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 2) are also characterized by hypopigmentation， reflecting the role of the affected proteins in melanogen-esis (melanin production). Patients with Chediak-Higashi syndrome also exhibit peripheral neuropathy and their leukocytes have characteristically large lysosomes删除25：<u></u>， whereas patients with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 2 show neutropenia (low levels of circulating neutrophils) and increased bleeding due to functionally abnormal platelets. Finally， hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is often observed in patients with X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome type 1 or type 2 删除25：<u></u>， IL-2-inducible T cell kinase (ITK) deficiency 删除25：<u></u>， and CD27 deficiency.\n\n【23】The diagnosis of HLH is based on a combination of clinical and laboratory fea-tures. In FHL， there is a genetically determined defect in lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity. NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity is usually assessed by culturing the patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells with 51Cr-labeled K562 target cells. If the patient's NK cells have intact cytotoxic activity， 51Cr is released into the super-natant. Any defect in activation， docking， or priming of the lytic granules can be detected by flow-cytometric analysis for the appearance of CD107a on the surface\n\n【24】删除3：<u>Fig. 14.3 Cytokine storm in HLH.</u>\n\n【25】In patients with HLH， viral infections trigger the activation of CD8+ T cells that undergo clonal expansion and activation， but cannot clear the viral infection. The activated CD8+T cells secrete large amounts of IFN-y， which promotes the activation of macrophages and the release of TNF-a， IL-6， and other pro-inflammatory molecules. This series of events ultimately causes tissue damage and hemophagocytosis.\n\n【26】of the patient's lymphocytes activated in vitro. This test gives a normal result in patients such as Jude， whose specific deficiency is in perforin. Flow cytometry may also be used to diagnose FHL2， by means ofintracellular staining for perforin.\n\n【27】Treatment of FHL is based on aggressive immunosuppression to stop the ongo ing immune activation. However， even if this is sufficient to achieve clinical remis-sion， patients remain highly prone to other episodes of accelerated phase， and the disease has a very high mortality rate. The only cure is through HSCT， which gives better results if reduced intensity conditioning is used. Experience in animal models suggests that administration of anti-IFN-y monoclonal antibody might be effective to achieve remission， without the risk of side effects related to the use of chemotherapy， steroids， or other immunosuppressive drugs. Administration of anti-human IFN-y for patients with HLH is currently being evaluated in a clinical trial. For the nonfamilial， secondary forms of HLH， treatment is based on elimina-tion of the trigger， in addition to immune suppression.",

He was referred by his primary physician to a physiatrist for an elec-tromyography (EMG) study， which showed slowed conduction in the median nerve at the carpal tunnel. He was then referred to a hand sur-geon for carpal tunnel release as an outpatient.\n\n【2】The patient's medical history is negative except for diet-controlled diabetes. He has had no previous operations， and thus has no history of previous anesthetics， nor a family history of problems with anesthesia. He has no allergies to medications， does not smoke， and consumes alco-hol occasionally at social events. His laboratory results and physical examination by his internist were normal as well. The patient has had nothing to eat or drink since he went to bed last night. He wishes to leave the Surgicenter as quickly as possible after the operation.\n\n【3】On examination， the patient weighs 225 lb and is 5 ft， 8 in tall.

His past medical history is remarkable for diet-controlled diabetes mellitus. His laboratory results and physical exam-ination are normal except for morbid obesity and a BMI of 35 kg/m.\n\n【10】\\> Anesthetic options： General， intravenous regional， peripheral nerve block， or local with sedation\n\n【11】\\> Indications for i.v. regional anesthesia： Extremity surgery of brief duration(<90 minutes)\n\n【12】\\> Risks of IV regional anesthesia： Local anesthetic toxicity， injury from tourniquet compression， block failure due to tourniquet pain requiring con-version to general anesthesia\n\n【13】ANALYSIS\n\n【14】Objectives\n\n【15】1\\. Understand the options for outpatient orthopedic anesthesia.\n\n【16】2\\. Describe the indications for intravenous regional anesthesia.\n\n【17】3\\. Recognize the risks of intravenous regional anesthesia.\n\n【18】4\\. Describe the technical approach to performing intravenous regional anesthesia.\n\n【19】Considerations\n\n【20】This patient is undergoing a minor surgical procedure followed shortly there-after by discharge from the facility. A carpal tunnel repair can easily be per-formed using intravenous (i.v.) regional anesthesia， thus allowing the patient to remain fully awake or lightly sedated during the procedure. There is no need for a general anesthetic， so his cognitive functions will remain intact， and he will experience little or no nausea or vomiting.\n\n【21】In addition to the i.v. inserted routinely for the surgery， a small， distal i.v. catheter is inserted into the extremity undergoing surgery. Next the operative extremity is exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage as the arm is elevated， and a proximal tourniquet is applied. A large dose of local anesthesia (typi-cally 50 mL of 0.5% lidocaine) is then injected through the catheter， quickly rendering the limb insensitive to pain and unable to move. Once the opera-tion is complete， the tourniquet is deflated， the remaining local anesthetic passes into the systemic circulation， and the limb's functions promptly return.\n\n【22】In a comparison of 126 patients undergoing hand surgery (excluding carpal tunnel release and ganglion excision) only 51% of the patients who received intravenous regional required postoperative analgesics compared to 85% of those who received general anesthesia.\n\n【23】Many orthopedic cases， ranging from minor procedures such as a carpal tun-nel repair to more complex cases such as arthroscopic rotator cuff repair are typically performed on an ambulatory basis. Since the patient is to be dis-charged on the same day as the surgical procedure， the primary goals of the anesthetic necessitate a rapid recovery to normal mentation， minimal side effects， and adequate pain control for discharge. Modern general anesthetics provide these conditions quite effectively.\n\n【24】Yet when compared to peripheral nerve blockade， general anesthetics are associated with higher postoperative nausea and pain scores anda greater need for post-anesthesia care unit time. However， the difference in overall time to discharge has not been reliably reproduced. (It was， however， noted that the discharge process may be sufficiently long as to mask any difference between these two procedures.).\n\n【25】CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【26】Indications for Intravenous Regional Anesthesia\n\n【27】Intravenous regional anesthesia was first introduced by German surgeon August Gustav Bier in 1908， and is often known as the “Bier block.\" Dr. Bier had an interest in the use of exsanguinating bandages to provide a bloodless surgical field. He found that by introducing procaine into a cut down periph-eral vein distal to a tourniquet， anesthesia would quickly occur in the extrem-ity， and that once the tourniquet was released， anesthesia would rapidly resolve. However， peripheral nerve blockade did not gain significant popular-ity until the 1960s， when a series of 30 patients receiving intravenous regional anesthesia appeared in The Lancet.\n\n【28】Today， i.v. regional anesthesia remains a popular choice for upper extrem-ity surgery including foreign body removal， arthroscopies， carpal tunnel release， de Quervain disease， amputations， plastic surgeries， and synovec-tomies. In addition to providing anesthesia for surgery， this technique has also for the treatment of palmar hyperhydrosis involving the injection of botu-linum toxin， as well as for the treatment of complex regional pain syndrome.\n\n【29】Anesthesia from the i.v. regional technique results from the exposure of small nerve endings and， to some extent， larger peripheral nerves， to local 删除换行1 anesthetics thus blocking nerve transmission. Ischemia of the extremity also contributes to the slowing nerve conduction. Unfortunately， the intercostal brachial nerve is not anesthetized because of its origin relative to the tourni-quet. This nerve， as well as unmyelinated C-fibers under the tourniquet， are also responsible for the pain related to prolonged tourniquet inflation.\n\n【30】Contraindications\n\n【31】Few absolute contraindications exist for i.v. regional anesthesia. Sickle cell disease is contraindicated， since the use of a tourniquet could potentially trig-ger a sickle crisis. An allergy to local anesthetics， or presence of infection or the inability to place an intravenous catheter at the site of placement also pre-cludes the use of this technique. Or， patients may simply refuse. Relative con traindications include untreated seizure disorders (since a lidocaine bolus may rapidly enter the systemic circulation)， high-grade heart block， bleeding disor-ders， and hepatic failure.\n\n【32】Risks of Intravenous Regional Anesthesia\n\n【33】Intravenous regional anesthesia has been lauded for its extremely high-safety profile. Early authors proposed that this technique could be used readily by non-anesthesiologists， including in the emergency department for the man-agement of a variety of injuries. However， given the amount of localanes-thetic involved， any practitioner utilizing this technique must be familiar with all aspects of local anesthetic toxicity and amply prepared for its management.\n\n【34】Local anesthetic toxicity often initially presents with symptoms period of nervous system excitability culminating in grand mal1profoundSseizure. Cardiovascular toxicity can follow， with significant arrhythmias and the potential for cardiovascular collapse. The tourniquet should have functioning alarms to alert the anesthesiologist of a sudden loss in tourniquet pressure， which could lead to the sudden systemic distribution of a large dose of local anesthetic. After a period of time， usually around 20 minutes， the local anes-thetic molecules become fixed to the tissues of the extremity. At this point， deflation of the tourniquet no longer results in a large quantity of the anes-thetic being released into the systemic circulation.\n\n【35】Other risks emanate from injury to structures compressed by the tourni-quet. The tourniquet for upper extremity surgery tends to be placed well above the antecubital region， but compression of peripheral nerves against bony prominences can lead to prolonged nerve ischemia and subsequent injury. Inattention to the placement of padding around the tourniquet can also contribute to skin injury. Lastly， if the duration of the operation exceeds expectations， the patient may begin to develop an almost uncon-trollable tourniquet pain that is not very responsive to analgesics， and which may require deepening the sedation， or even the induction of gen-eral anesthesia.\n\n【36】The choice of local anesthetic is relatively straightforward. The duration of action of the local anesthetic in this anesthetic approach is primarily deter-mined by duration of the tourniquet. Therefore， the use of short-acting local anesthetics has been advocated due to the lower risks of serious， persistent cardiovascular complications in the setting of a tourniquet failure. Procaine and lidocaine are the most common choices.\n\n【37】Technique for Intravenous Regional Anesthesia\n\n【38】The patient is prepared for anesthesia as all patients are prepared and accord-ing to the guidelines of the ASA. A preoperative evaluation must be per-formed； patients should have fasted in the usual fashion； appropriate monitors including the standard ASA monitors (pulse oximetry， noninvasive blood pressure， ECG) should all be applied. Standard emergency medications as well as a functioning bag-mask system or anesthesia machine should be available.\n\n【39】Intravenous catheters are placed in both extremities. In the operative extremity， the catheter should be placed as distal as possible and not in the operative field if at all possible. Small doses of premedication may be given for anxiolysis. Some authors promote routine use of benzodiazepines to raise the seizure threshold in the event of systemic vascular uptake of local anesthetic， though excessive premedication may contribute to a prolonged recovery room stay. Infiltration of the intercostal brachial nerve may be performed at this time with 3 to 5 mL of local anesthetic.\n\n【40】Next， a double tourniquet should be placed above the antecubital fossa on the operative extremity. The tourniquet should be padded and carefully inspected to verify absence of any pressure points. Wider tourniquets may be better tolerated， due to the greater surface area of tissue bearing the impact of the tourniquet. The electronic monitoring of the tourniquets must have passed their initial self-check and appear to function appropriately. Most authors rec-ommend an extremity pressure of 250 mm Hg， or at least 100 mm Hg above sys-temic pressure. The extremity should then be raised above the heart for a few minutes， and an Esmarch bandage applied to exsanguinate the extremity. Once the exsanguination is complete， the proximal tourniquet should be raised.\n\n【41】Once satisfactory inflation of the tourniquet has been achieved， the injec-tion of local anesthetic into the operative extremities intravenous catheter is undertaken. A typical volume of 50 mL of 0.5% lidocaine， or approximately3 mg/kg， is injected slowly to prevent an excessive intravenous pressure which can overcome the tourniquet’s pressure. During the injection， the patient is ques-tioned for signs of local anesthetic toxicity such as numbness around the mouth， ring- ing in the ears， headache， or a general sense of feeling bad. The injection should take approximately 90 seconds to complete. The limb will remain almost white in color， and become rapidly insensitive to pain and lose the ability to move. If the limb's color becomes either dark red or blue， the tourniquet is leaking and local anesthetic could be rapidly absorbed into the circulation if the injection is continued.\n\n【42】After approximately 25 to 45 minutes of anesthesia， the patient may begin to complain of tourniquet pain. At this time， the distal cuff (which is over an area anesthetized by the lidocaine) may be inflated and the proximal cuff deflated. Prior to performing this maneuver， it is useful to pause to reconsider the procedure. This reflation-deflation technique may allow for an additional15 to 20 minutes of operative time.\n\n【43】At the completion of the operation， the surgeon should be encouraged to infiltrate the wound with local anesthetic to minimize the need for postoper-ative analgesics in the recovery room. The cuff may then be released briefly(5-10 seconds) and then reinflated for 30 seconds for several iterations 通用删除7(英):<u>(3-6)</u>. This may allow for a lower maximum dose of local anesthetic released as a sin-gle bolus. If the patient complains of symptoms consistent with local anes-thetic toxicity， it may be reasonable to prolong the reinflation period.\n\n【44】Local Anesthetic Toxicity\n\n【45】Signs： Light headedness， tinnitus， headache， circumoral numbness or tin-gling， metallic taste in the mouth\n\n【46】Symptoms： Muscle twitching， loss of consciousness， grand mal seizure， vas-cular collapse\n\n【47】Treatment：(“Airway， breathing， circulation\").Oxygen， support ventilation if necessary (local anesthetic toxicity is exacerbated by hypercarbia)， anti-convulsants such as a benzodiazepine or thiopental， support the circulation. Intubation may be necessary to protect the airway. Bretylium or cardioversion is given for ventricular arrhythmias， intralipid for bupivacaine toxicity.",

A chest x-ray will determine the underlying status of the lung parenchyma and whether a trigger for the current situation can be identified.CHRONIC BRONCHITIS： COPD component that is diagnosed clinically and is characterized by excessive secretion of bronchial mucus and productive cough for3 months or more in at least 2 consecutive years in the absence of any other disease that might account for this symptom.\n\nCHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD)： Chronic air-flow obstruction caused by chronic bronchitis or emphysema.COPD is a prevent-able and treatable disease characterized by persistent airflow limitation that is usually progressive and associated with enhanced chronic inflammatory response in the lungs to noxious particles and gases. Diagnosis in the right clinical setting is usually supported by FEV /FVC ratio less than 0.7. Severity of COPD on spirom-etry is based on the level of FEV，/FVC ratio compared to the predicted value. The severity of airflow limitation can be classified based on postbronchodilator FEV.FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN 1 SECOND (FEV)： Volume of air expired in the first second during maximal expiratory effort. FEV is reduced in both obstructive lung disease (increased airway resistance) and restrictive lung dis-ease (low VC)\n增加换行3：| Table 15-1·CLASSIFICATION OF SEVERITY OF COPD BASED ON THE RESPONSE OF FEV TO BRONCHODILATORS  |  |  |\n| Stage  | Severity  | FEV，(% predicted)  |\n| GOLD 1  | Mild  | \\>80%  |\n| GOLD 2  | Moderate  | 50%-79%  |\n| GOLD 3  | Severe  | 30%-49%  |\n| GOLD 4  | Very severe  | <30%  |\n\n【9】Abbreviations：FEV。 forced expiratory volume in 1 second； GOLD， Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease.The most common etiology for COPD is inhalation injury， specifically cigarette smoking. Another important cause is alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency， which is hered-itary； pulmonary disease may become evident by age 40 and may occur without cough or smoking history. Therapy by replacement of alpha-1 antitrypsin enzyme is available. Characteristically， patients with COPD present with progressively worsening dyspnea (first on exertion， then with activity， then at rest). Patients may vary in appearance from a\"blue bloater” (chronic bronchitis， overweight， edema-tous， cyanotic) to a\"pink puffer\" (emphysema， thin， ruddy cheeks).\n\n【10】Arterial blood gases often are normal in the early phase of the disease； however， in more advanced disease， there is evidence of hypoxemia and hypercapnia， often with a chronic compensated respiratory acidosis as a consequence of CO， reten-tion. Such chronic stable patients may have a Pao， near 50 mm Hg and a Paco， near 50 mm Hg， but a near-normal pH (the“50-50\" club). During an acute exac-erbation， more severe hypoxemia or hypercapnia， or respiratory acidosis noted on ABG， may be an indication of impending respiratory failure and need for ventila-tory support. Given an appropriate clinical context， general indications for measur-ing ABGs include low oxygen saturation on pulse oximetry (< 92%)， depressed level of consciousness， acute exacerbation， or assessment of hypercapnia in at-risk patients 30 to 60 minutes after supplemental oxygen is initiated.\n\nSpirometry is the most basic， inexpensive， widely valuable PFT to diagnose pulmonary diseases 删除33：<u></u>. Spirometric tracings of forced expiration删除33：<u></u> and flow-volume loops 删除33：<u></u> help to identify the type of lung disease (obstructive vs restrictive)， as well as potential reversibility of airflow obstruction. Restrictive lung diseases tend to have lower lung volumes (decreased TLC and VC)， whereas obstructive diseases have larger lung volumes (TLC normal or increased) with decreased expiratory flow rates (reduced FEV < 80% expected， and FEV，/FVC< 0.7). Specific parameters help to classify the type and degree of lung dysfunction . Reduced FEV /FVC with minimal response to bronchodilators is the hallmark of COPD.Figure 15-1.

        "text": "【0】CASE 41: STANDARD OF CARE AND NEGLIGENCE\n\n【1】Joe is on a busy ward round with his consultant. The round is post-take and he has seen 23  删除换行1 patients so far. One of his patients is septic and needs a prescription for intravenous antibiotics. The consultant tells Joe to put him on ciprofloxacin. However, Joe is aware that the  删除换行1 hospital protocol has changed and that ciprofloxacin is no longer the first-line antibiotic due  删除换行1 to the increasing incidence of Clostridium difficile infection after its use. He suggests giving intravenous co-amoxiclav instead. The consultant agrees and appears impressed that Joe  删除换行1 is up-to-date with the antibiotic guidelines. Joe prescribes the antibiotic. A few hours later  删除换行1 he is called to the ward urgently as the septic patient is having difficulty breathing and has  删除换行1 developed urticaria. He has had an anaphylactic reaction to co-amoxiclav. Joe realises that  删除换行1 the allergies box on the drug chart states that the patient is allergic to penicillin. He puts out  删除换行1 a medical emergency call and after further assessment the patient is transferred to ITU. After  删除换行1 24 hours on ITU the patient returns to the ward. No permanent damage has occurred.\n\n【2】Questions\n\n【3】• What is clinical negligence?\n\n【4】• Has Joe been negligent?\n\n【5】• What can he do to protect himself against a claim in negligence?\n\n【6】ANSWER 41\n\n【7】A healthcare professional owes a duty of care toward his patients. This duty is to exercise  删除换行1 reasonable skill and care in diagnosis, treatment and provision of healthcare information  删除换行1 (Case 42). The healthcare professional breaches his duty of care if he falls below the standard of care. For a doctor, this is the standard of care practised by a responsible body of  删除换行1 doctors professing that skill. A patient who has been harmed as a result of medical care  删除换行1 may bring a claim in negligence seeking compensation.\n\n【8】A patient has to prove that a doctor is negligent by demonstrating that\n\n【9】• The doctor owed the patient a duty of care\n\n【10】• The doctor failed to give an appropriate standard of care\n\n【11】• But for the failure of care, the harm would not have occurred and the harm is reasonably foreseeable\n\n【12】The claim must be brought within 3 years of the date when the harm occurred or the date  删除换行1 when the patient knew or should have realised that he may have a claim. Experts provide evidence about the appropriate standard of care and will consider professional guidance issued  删除换行1 by the relevant speciality. If the claim is successful, compensation will be awarded and damages can be very high. In 2012 compensation worth £10.8 million was awarded to enable fulltime care and equipment for a girl who suffered injuries after doctors failed to notice that her  删除换行1 heart had stopped shortly after birth.\nThe NHS hospital trust is vicariously liable for negligence of its employees. A claim is brought  删除换行1 against the NHS trust employing the doctor who is alleged to have caused the harm. The  删除换行5 National Health Service Litigation Authority handles claims against the NHS in England. It  删除换行1 reported that there was a 10.8% increase in clinical claims (from 9,143 claims in 2011/12 to  删除换行1 10,129 in 2012/13) but less than 1% go to a court hearing. Nearly one-fifth 删除10：<u>(£22.7 billion in  删除换行1 2012)</u> of the NHS annual budget is set aside for compensation payments.\nLitigation is a stressful and costly experience for claimants and has a negative effect on  删除换行5 NHS staff. The Francis Report published in 2013 following the inquiry into care at the Mid \n\n【13】Staffordshire Hospital recommended an open and transparent culture within the NHS.\nThere is now a ‘duty of candour’ on all NHS trusts in England which requires them to be  删除换行1 open and honest with patients and their families, admit their mistakes and apologise when  删除换行1 things go wrong.\n\n【14】In this scenario it was Joe’s responsibility to check before prescribing medication that the  删除换行1 patient did not have any allergies. However, the nurse who gave the drug also has a responsibility to check allergies. Although Joe failed in his care to the patient, because there was no  删除换行1 long-term harm, it is unlikely that a claim for negligence would be pursued.\n\n【15】Key Points\n\n【16】• Clinical negligence claims are increasing and a large part of the NHS budget is set  删除换行1 aside for compensation awards.\n\n【17】• A duty of candour requires healthcare professionals to be open and honest with  删除换行1 patients when something goes wrong.",

Multinodular toxic goiter\n\n【5】Answer: 44.1 C. Graves disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in the United States. It often includes the thyroid gland features described, as well as the distinctive eye findings.\n\n【6】Question: 44.2 Which of the following distinguishes hyperthyroidism from thyroid storm?\n\n【7】A. Tachycardia to heart rate 120 bpm\n\n【8】B. Weight loss\n\n【9】C. Fever and delirium\n\n【10】D. Large goiter\n\n【11】Answer: 44.2 C. Thyroid storm is an exaggeration of hyperthyroid features with extreme tachycardia (heart rate >140 bpm), fever, and central nervous system dysfunction, such as confusion or coma. It is a medical emergency with a high mortality.\n\n【12】Question: 44.3 A 58-year-old woman is noted to have Graves disease and has a small goiter.

        "text": "【0】Case Files™ Neurology, Second Edition    \n\n【1】### CASE 13\n\n【2】A 22-year-old previously healthy college student presents to the emergency department with the complaint of gait instability and a right eyelid droop. He began noticing these symptoms 2 days ago, the morning after a friend put him in a choke hold during a wrestling match. He managed to break free after a struggle and subsequently noticed a right temporal headache after the wrestling match. The patient’s temperature is 36.4°C (97.6°F); heart rate, 64 beats/min; and blood pressure, 118/78 mmHg. General physical examination is unremarkable. The neurologic examination reveals ptosis of the right eye and anisocoria, with a pupillary diameter of 2 mm on the right and 4 mm on the left. Light reactivity is intact directly and consensually. Extraocular movements are normal. There is a mild left hemiparesis involving left face, arm, and leg. Gait is hemiparetic, and the patient tends to fall without assistance. The electrocardiogram is normal. Complete blood count, electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, glucose, urinalysis, prothrombin time (PT), and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) are normal. Noncontrast head CT shows an area of acute hypodensity in the right frontoparietal region.\n\n【3】 What is the most likely diagnosis and mechanism?\n\n【4】 What is the next diagnostic step?\n\n【5】### ANSWERS TO CASE 13: Stroke in a Young Patient (Acute Ischemic)\n\n【6】Summary : A 22-year-old patient presenting with a right Horner syndrome and right hemispheric ischemic stroke after minor neck trauma.\n\n【7】• Most likely diagnosis and mechanism: Acute ischemic stroke caused by right carotid artery dissection as a result of trauma.\n\n【8】• Next diagnostic step: Cerebral arteriogram.\n\n【9】#### ANALYSIS\n\n【10】##### Objectives\n\n【11】1\\. Understand that stroke occurs in patients of all ages.\n\n【12】2\\. Recognize the less typical stroke etiologies that often affect younger patients.\n\n【13】3\\. Be familiar with the diagnostic workup of stroke in the young patient.\n\n【14】##### Considerations\n\n【15】The clinical diagnosis of a stroke relies on the appropriate clinical history, neurologic findings, and supportive brain imaging studies. Although the majority of strokes occur in patients 65 years of age or older, tens of thousands of strokes per year nonetheless occur in patients 55 years of age or younger in the United States. Just as in older patients, the clinical suspicion of stroke should come to the forefront when focal neurologic deficits emerge acutely. This particular patient underwent a “choke hold,” which injured the right carotid artery, leading to ischemia to the right frontal aspect of the brain and associated carotid structures.\n\n【16】### APPROACH TO: Stroke in a Young Patient\n\n【17】#### DEFINITIONS\n\n【18】CAROTID DISSECTION: A tear in the carotid arterial wall that can result in luminal obstruction, thromboembolic complications, and/or pseudoaneurysm formation. Dissections can also occur in the vertebral arteries, or less commonly, the large intracranial arteries.\n\n【19】PATENT FORAMEN OVALE: A persistent opening in the interatrial septum associated with paradoxical embolism in patients with cryptogenic stroke.\n\n【20】ARTERIOVENOUS MALFORMATIONS: Congenital high-pressure, high-flow cerebral vascular malformations characterized by direct arteriovenous shunting.\n\n【21】#### CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【22】The diagnostic evaluation in a younger stroke patient is more extensive because the likelihood is greater of a nonatherosclerotic etiology. Some of these are discussed below. The workup may include a brain MRI, cerebral angiography or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the intracranial and cervical vessels, transesophageal echocardiogram, and laboratory studies including lipid panel, homocysteine, protein C, protein S, antithrombin III, anticardiolipin antibody, lupus anticoagulant, factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin gene mutation, and a toxicology screen. Other studies that can be indicated in the appropriate clinical setting might include lumbar puncture, HIV serology, blood cultures, vasculitis serologies, and screening for sickle cell disease.\n\n【23】#### ETIOLOGIES AND CLINICAL PRESENTATIONS\n\n【24】The same causes of stroke in older patients can affect younger adults, especially in younger patients who possess the traditional atherosclerotic risk factors of hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. The largest categories of stroke in the general population are cardioembolic, large-vessel atherothrombotic, and lacunar. A patent foramen ovale (PFO) is detectable in approximately 15% to 30% of the general population, but its prevalence is higher in young patients with cryptogenic ischemic stroke. The mechanism is presumed to be paradoxical embolism. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is the most common way to detect a PFO, although its sensitivity is impaired by the need to sedate a patient for the exam. Alternatively, transcranial Doppler bubble testing is highly sensitive for a right-to-left cardiac shunt, but may result in false positives from a noncardiac source, such as a pulmonary AVM. Atrial septal aneurysms are also linked to cryptogenic stroke and best evaluated by TEE.\n\n【25】Craniocervical dissection is commonly but not always preceded by head or neck trauma such as a motor vehicle accident, chiropractic neck manipulation, or a bout of severe coughing, vomiting, or sneezing 删除33：<u></u>. Dissections can present with headache or thromboembolic cerebrovascular events. Carotid dissection is often associated with a Horner syndrome , that is, ipsilateral ptosis and miosis. Fibro-muscular dysplasia, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, and Marfan syndrome are predisposing factors to spontaneous craniocervical dissection.\n\n【26】通用删除2(英):<u>删除3：<u>Figure 13–1 . Cerebral arteriogram of internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection. 删除10：<u>删除33：<u>通用删除1(英):<u>( Reproduced, with permission, from Brunicardi FC, et al . Schwartz’s Principles of Surgery, 8th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Publishers, 2004:Fig. 22–92 .)</u></u></u></u></u>\n\n【27】Arteriovenous malformations and the lower-flow cavernous angiomas are associated with intracerebral hemorrhage as well as seizures and other neurologic presentations. Moyamoya disease is an idiopathic noninflammatory cerebral vasculopathy characterized by progressive occlusion of the large arteries at the circle of Willis, most commonly the distal internal carotid artery. The characteristic moyamoya vessels refer to the small penetrating arteries that hypertrophy in response to chronic cerebral ischemia.\n\n【28】Drugs of abuse, especially cocaine and amphetamines, are associated with both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Oral contraceptives are a risk factor for thromboembolic stroke, especially in women over 35 who smoke. A history of intravenous drug abuse should raise the suspicion of endocarditis and HIV disease. Other rarer infectious etiologies of stroke include tuberculous meningitis and varicella zoster.\n\n【29】Hypercoagulable conditions can predispose to stroke. These include malignancy, antiphospholipid antibodies, protein C deficiency, protein S deficiency, anti-thrombin III deficiency, factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin gene mutation, and hyperhomocysteinemia. Some of these entities are most clearly linked to venous thromboembolism, which is particularly relevant to patients with cerebral venous thrombosis or a PFO.\n\n【30】##### Treatment\n\n【31】Treatment is tailored to the specific stroke etiology. Antithrombotic drugs are a mainstay of therapy for most patients with ischemic stroke. Very few randomized clinical trials have been performed to help guide the choice of antiplatelet or anticoagulant treatment for the specific stroke subtypes discussed above. One such trial revealed no significant difference between aspirin and warfarin in patients with ischemic stroke associated with an antiphospholipid antibody. Similar studies comparing aspirin to anticoagulation in cervical artery dissection have shown no significant difference in efficacy.\n\n【32】Endovascular closure of PFO is currently under investigation and not recommended outside of a clinical trial. Because a substantial proportion of carotid or vertebral dissections spontaneously recanalize, stenting is usually reserved for patients who show no vessel recanalization after 3 to 6 months or who have unstable appearing psuedoaneurysms. The treatment of arteriovenous malformations can employ a combination of surgery, radiation, and endovascular therapies. Surgical revascularization procedures such as encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis or superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) bypass are frequently performed for moyamoya disease.\n\n【33】####",

        "text": "【0】Case 47\nA 23-year-old man is brought into the clinic by his mother. She states he has not been acting like himselfever since he received a head injury in the war. Previously a polite and easygoing individual， she says he is now ill-tempered and makes fre-quent inappropriate comments. As a result the patient has not been able to hold down a steady job and has alienated many of his friends. She says he has noticed simple tasks to be more frustrating lately but otherwise does not think he has changed since his injury.\n\n【1】On examination， the patient has a scar over his right forehead. His neurologi-cal examination is normal with the exception of perseveration on his cerebellar function testing.\n\n【2】What area of the brain has most likely been injured， leading to this patient’s symptoms：\n\n【3】Why has the patient experienced personality changes?\n\n【4】How will the patient respond when presented with a novel task?\n\n【5】Summary： A 23-year-old posttraumatic brain injury patient presents with symptoms of disinhibition and personality change.\n\n【6】· Region of the brain most likely injured： The frontal lobes， the site of executive cognitive function， are the most likely area to have been damaged. The frontal lobes are commonly involved in traumatic brain injury (TBI)， owing to location and size. Likewise， the sphenoid wing and orbit of the skull damage the brain when applied with force to the tissue.\n\n【7】Most likely cause of the patient’s symptoms： The frontal lobes are responsible for executive cognitive function and are considered the source of personality and emotional control. Patients with dysexecutive syndrome have difficulty in social settings requiring intricate thought processes and intuitive nuances.\n\n【8】When the patient is presented with a novel task： The executive system facili-tates learning， making actions and problem solving less effortful with repeti-tion. The frontal lobes also function in conceptualization of abstract problems and following through with a complex， predetermined plan. Inability to adapt to novel situations and interactions combined with a disinhibition of emo-tional control and social norms may cause patients with frontal lobe damage to become easily enraged.\n\n【9】CLINICAL CORRELATION\n\n【10】The symptoms exhibited by this patient suggest that he has a frontal lobe lesion. Lesions in the frontal lobes are known to cause aggressiveness in patients (ie， Phineas Gage phenomenon) and hinder the patient’s ability to carry out executive functions. These functions include behaviors such as planning multistep tasks， the capacity for quick switching to the appropriate mental mode， the ability to with-stand distractions or internal urges， anticipation， logical analysis， working memory multitasking， and decision making.\n\n【11】APPROACH TO：Executive Function\n\n【12】OBJECTIVES\n\n【13】1\\. Be able to define the role of the frontal lobes in higher cognitive function.\n\n【14】2\\. Understand the common symptoms associated with frontal lobe lesions and traumatic brain injury.\n\n【15】3\\. Be familiar with the mechanisms for testing executive function.\n\n【16】DEFINITIONS\n\n【17】PERSEVERATION： Persistent repetition of an activity， word， phrase， or move-ment without any apparent stimulus for it.\n\n【18】COUP/CONTRECOUP： Contusions both at the site of impact (coup) and on the opposite side (contrecoup) of the brain.\n\n【19】THURSTONE (LETTER FLUENCY， WORD GENERATION) TEST： Ask the patient to generate as many words as possible beginning with the letter F in1 minute. A normal score for a native English speaker with at least a high school education is 8 words or more.\n\n【20】SERIAL 7S： Counting down from 100 by 7s. Tests concentration and memory. Spelling the word world backward is commonly used as a substitute for patients who cannot perform calculations of 7s.\n\n【21】DIGIT SPAN： Also a measure of attention and concentration. A normal span is seven digits forward and five backward. An abnormal digit span is the most common neuropsychological deficit in patients with head injury.\n\n【22】The frontal lobe is an area in the brain of mammals located at the front of each cere-bral hemisphere. The frontal lobes are positioned anterior to the parietal lobes， and the temporal lobes are located beneath and behind the frontal lobes. In the human brain， the precentral gyrus and the related cortical tissue that folds into the central sulcus comprise the primary motor cortex， which controls voluntary movements of specific body parts associated with areas of the gyrus. The frontal lobes have been found to play a part in impulse control， judgment， language production， working memory， motor function， sexual behavior， socialization， and spontaneity. The fron-tal lobes assist in planning， coordinating，controlling， and executing behavior. Peo-ple who have damaged frontal lobes may experience problems with these aspects of cognitive function， being at times impulsive， impaired in their ability to plan and execute complex sequences of actions， and perhaps persisting with one course of action or pattern of behavior when a change would be appropriate.\n\n【23】The executive functions of the frontal lobe involve abstract thinking， rule acqui-sition， problem solving， planning， cognitive flexibility， selecting relevant sensory information， initiating behavior， monitoring behavior via judgment and impulse control， motor function， executive memory， language， sexual behavior， and decision making. It allows for adaptation to new environments and the acquisition of new skills or manners of thinking. This includes insight and error correction， enabling one to navigate dangerous or technically difficult situations. Important in social functioning， executive cognition allows for the suppression of strong habitual responses or temptations.\n\n【24】The executive system organizes and prioritizes cognitive resources in such a way as to allow for complex conceptualization of abstract problems and execution of detailed plans and actions. It is required for foresight or temporal planning， crit-ical analysis of rules， limitations and abilities， focus for attainment of goals， and 删除换行1 reflection for troubleshooting and adaptation. For previously encountered situa-tions， a patient with dysexecutive syndrome can rely on learned， automatic physical and psychological responses. In novel situations， however， the patient does not have these automatic responses to fall back on or the abilities to organize his thoughts in order to deal with the new circumstances. Patients are unable to reach a particular goal secondary to the fact that they cannot plan and execute the smaller individual steps to achieve the desired end. The end result is thatthe patient is seen as apa-thetic and easily distractible. This can also be frustrating for a patient， which may lead to outbursts of anger.\n\n【25】Damage to the frontal lobes may occur through traumatic injury， mass lesions， cerebrovascular and degenerative disease， or infection. For example， the frontal lobes are affected by normal aging， and by pathological degenerative processes， such as multiple sclerosis， Huntington’s disease， and AD. Cerebrovascular disease， such as the occlusion or hemorrhage of the anterior communicating artery， also may lead to damage of the frontal lobes. The dominant neurotransmitter in the frontal lobe is dopamine. Low levels of dopamine often present as problems in frontal lobe func-tioning， one example of such being schizophrenia.\n\n【26】The most commonly cited example of a dysexecutive patient is that of Phineas Gage. Mr Gage sustained injury to his prefrontal cortex (PFC) following a railroad construction accident in 1848， when a 1.1-m， 6-kg tamping iron went in under his left cheek bone and out through the top of his head. Mr Gage went from being an efficient foreman to an impulsive， profane individual with an inability to plan and carry out productive goals. While intelligence is intact， patients with frontal lobe damage show difficulty with emotional control， social interaction， and memory. This disinhibition is attributed to a disconnection between the PFC and the auto-nomic nervous system. Without a“warning\" to alert the individual to a dangerous， undesirable， or sensitive situation， executive decision making is severely hampered. As such， executive cognition may not act so much to inform us of what behaviors are appropriate but more to deter us from inappropriate interactions. The difficulty interpreting environmental stimuli contributes to the previously described social dysfunction and impaired learning (feedback to guide behavior).\n\n【27】The impulse-control difficulties leading to social dysfunction also may manifest as utilization behavior. For example， without instruction or reason， patients may be compelled to use daily objects within their visual field. For example， if a patient were to see a toothbrush in front of him， he would begin to brush his teeth， and do so repeatedly， even if he had already brushed his teeth. When asked why they are using this object without purpose， patients tend to confabulate. Patients may also perseverate in speech and action.\n\n【28】Spontaneity appears to originate in the frontal lobes as well. Patients with frontal lobe damage have limited facial expression and can have either increased spontaneity of speech (right frontal in a right-handed individual) or decreased (left frontal). Patients may also have deficits of declarative memory or memory for tem-poral order of events. Working memory and attention are frequently impaired. This is in contrast to the declarative memory deficits found with hippocampal damage.",

Angioedema secondary to ACE inhibitors can occur at any subsequent point during use， not solely after the initial doses. Reactions to exogenous agents such as soap (answer B) typically result from a type IV HSR and usually present as a skin rash. Causes of anaphylactic reactions include drugs (answer D) and food (answer E). A true anaphylactic reaction is life threatening； it may present with angioedema with or without urticaria， but it also presents with other life threatening processes， such as hypotension. Drug allergies may present as an anaphylactic reaction or a drug rash； most drug rashes are maculopapular and occur several days after starting treatment with an offending drug and resolve with discontinuation of the drug. Hypo-thyroidism (answer C) is an autoimmune disease process most commonly caused by autoantibodies against thyroid peroxidase， thyroglobulin， and/or TSH receptors.\n\n【20】40.2 B. This is a common presentation of hypersensitivity syndrome associated with aromatic anticonvulsants (phenytoin， carbamazepine， phenobarbital). Poison ivy (answer A) is not associated with fever and lymphadenopathy. Lyme disease (answer D) is associated with erythema migrans， an erythema-tous annular rash with a central clearing (target lesion) developing within days of infection. HIV (answer C) is a less likely answer considering that a history of risk factors is not being presented.\n\n【21】40.3 D. This patient has developed airway obstruction due to an anaphylactic reaction. He requires intubation and mechanical ventilation to maintain oxygenation. The first step in treating anaphylaxis is assessing the ABCs. Intubation， if required， should not be delayed. Second， epinephrine (answer B) should be administered to help control symptoms and blood pressure. Additional treatment measures include placing the patient in a recumbent position， elevating the legs， administration of oxygen as needed (answer C)， NS volume replacement and/or use of vasopressors as required， and adminis-tration of diphenhydramine 50 mg orally or intravenously every 4 hours as needed (answer A). Electrical cardioversion (answer E) is not indicated in the treatment of anaphylaxis.\n\n【22】40.4 D. Pretreatment with diphenhydramine， H， blockers， and corticosteroids beginning 12 hours before the procedure greatly decreases the reaction to contrast dye. For patients presenting with clinical indication for rapid imag-ing， premedication should be given at least 5 hours prior to contrast admin-istration (answer B). Therefore， there is no need to cancel the procedure and proceed with surgery (answer C). Desensitization (answer A) is not an appropriate treatment course since radiocontrast allergy is not a true allergic reaction.\n\n【23】CLINICAL PEARLS\n\n【24】Anaphylaxis is characterized by respiratory distress caused by broncho-spasm， cutaneous manifestations such as urticaria or angioedema， and gastrointestinal hypermotility. Patients may die as a consequence of air-way compromise or vascular collapse caused by widespread vasodilation.\n\n【25】Treatment of anaphylaxis is immediate epinephrine， antihistamines， air-way protection， and blood pressure support as necessary. Corticosteroids may help prevent late recurrence of symptoms.\n\n【26】Epinephrine is the immediate drug of choice in treating anaphylaxis.\n\n【27】Serum sickness is an immune complex-mediated disease that may include fever， cutaneous eruptions， lymphadenopathy，arthritis， and glo-merulonephritis. It usually is self-limited， but treatment may be necessary for renal complications.\n\n【28】Erythema multiforme minor is characterized by urticarial or bullous eruptions， often with target lesions， usually following HSV infections.

        "text": "【0】Case 6\nA 29-year-old parous (G5P4) woman at 39 weeks'gestation with preeclampsia delivers vaginally.Her prenatal course has been uncomplicated except for asymp-tomatic bacteriuria caused by Escherichia coli in the first trimester treated with oral cephalexin.

She denies a family history of a bleeding diathesis. After the placenta is delivered， there is appreciable vaginal bleeding， estimated at 1000 cc.\n\n【6】Most likely diagnosis： Uterine atony.\n\n【7】Next step in therapy： Dilute intravenous (IV) oxytocin， bedside uterine mas-sage and compression， and if this is ineffective， then intramuscular prostaglan-din F，-alpha (Hemabate) or rectal misoprostol.\n\n【8】ANALYSIS\n\n【9】Objectives\n\n【10】1\\. Know the definition of postpartum hemorrhage.\n\n【11】2\\. Understand that the most common cause of postpartum hemorrhage is uter-ine atony.\n\n【12】3\\. Know the treatment for uterine atony and the contraindications for the vari-ous agents.\n\n【13】Considerations\n\n【14】This 29-year-old woman delivers at 39 weeks’gestation and has an estimated blood loss of 1000 cc after the placenta delivers. This meets the definition of postpartum hemorrhage for a vaginal delivery， which is a loss of 500 mL or more. The most common etiology is uterine atony， in which the myometrium has not contracted to cut off the uterine spiral arteries that are supplying the placental bed. Bladder emptying， uterine massage， and dilute oxytocin are the first therapies. If these are ineffective， then prostaglandin F -alpha or rectal misoprostol is the next agent to be used in this patient. Because she is hypertensive， methylergonovine maleate(Methergine) is contraindicated. It should be noted that if the uterus is palpated and found to be firm and yet bleeding continues， a laceration to the genital tract should be suspected. Her risk factors for uterine atony include preeclampsia since she is likely to be treated with magnesium sulfate.\n\n【15】APPROACHTO：\n\n【16】Postpartum Hemorrhage\n\n【17】DEFINITIONS\n\n【18】POSTPARTUMHEMORRHAGE(PPH)：Classically defined as greater than 500mL of blood loss at a vaginal delivery and greater than 1000 mL during a cesarean delivery. Practically speaking， it means significant bleeding that may result in hemo-dynamic instability if unabated.\n\n【19】Also， a decline in hematocrit levels of 10% has been used to define postpartum hemorrhage， but it is not a satisfactory definition because determinations of hemo-globin or hematocrit concentrations may not reflect the current hematologic status.\n\n【20】UTERINE ATONY： Lack of myometrial contraction， clinically manifested by a boggy uterus.\n\n【21】METHYLERGONOVINE MALEATE (METHERGINE)： An ergot alkaloid agent that induces myometrial contraction as a treatment of uterine atony， contra-indicated in hypertension.\n\n【22】PROSTAGLANDIN F.-ALPHA： A prostaglandin compound that stimulates myometrial contraction， contraindicated in asthmatic patients.\n\n【23】CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【24】Postpartum hemorrhage is defined as primary (early) and secondary (late) accord-ing to whether it occurs within the first 24 hours or after that period. The most common cause of early PPH is uterine atony， with bleeding arising from the placen-tal implantation site. \n\n【25】The physical examination reveals a boggy uterus. Table 6-2 summarizes the stepwise approach to PPH. Because of the large proportion of cardiac output that perfuses the uterus and placental bed， a postpartum woman can exsanguinate in 10to 15 minutes without intervention.\n\n【26】Uterotonic agents include intramuscular methylergonovine (Methergine)， intra-muscular prostaglandin F -alpha， and rectal misoprostol. Ergot alkaloids should not be given in women with hypertensive disease because of the risk of stroke. Prostaglandin F -alpha should not be administered in those with asthma due to the potential for bronchoconstriction. Among these three agents， rectal misoprostol has emerged in many centers as the preferred agent due to high efficacy， low cost，\n\n| Table 6-1·RISKFACTORS FORUTERINE ATONY  |\n| --- |\n| Magnesium sulfate Oxytocin use during laborRapid labor and/or delivery Overdistention ofthe uterus (macrosomia， multifetalpregnancy， and hydramnios)Intraamniotic infection (chorioamnionitis) Prolonged labor High parity  |\n\n| Table 6-2·TREATMENT FOR POSTPARTUM HEMORRHAGE  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Assessment Steps  | Intervention  | Comment  |\n| Assess hemorrhage byvital sig ns and blood in collection (recall that Hg b not accurate)  | Support ABCs  | Continue to monitor ABCsand support BP  |\n| Palpate uterine fundus  | If firm， consider lacerations(surgical management) or coagu-lopathy (replace clotting factors) Ifboggy，then bimanual massage and Ⅳdilute oxytocin  | Bimanual compression withabdominalhand and vaginalhand concurrently  |\n| Pharmacological agents  | Ergot alkaloids， prostag landinF，-alpha and/or misoprostol×2-3 doses  | Contraindications to ergotalkaloid =hypertension；con-traindication to PGF2-alpha=asthma  |\n| If continues to bleed  | Two large-bore Is， Foley catheterplacement to empty bladder，callfor blood， monitor vitals， move the patient to the OR  | Do not continue interven-tions in the labor and delivery room ifno responseto medications  |\n| Ifsomewhat stable， consider nonsurg icalintervention  | Intrauterine balloon or uterineartery embolization  | Intrauterine balloon cantamponade bleeding  |\n| Ifunstable orbleeding rapidly， then laparotomy  | If future childbearing is desired，consider compression stitches such as B-lynch， ligation ofblood supplies such as OTearysutures for ligating bilateraluterine arteries Ifno childbearing desired， thenhysterectomy  |  |\n\n【29】and low side effects. If medical therapy is ineffective， two large-bore intravenous lines should be placed， the blood bank should be notified， and anesthesiologist alerted.Intrauterine tamponade such as with a balloon can be performed while pre-paring for surgical therapy. Surgical therapy may include exploratory laparotomy with interruption of the blood vessels to the uterus such as uterine artery liga-tion or internal iliac artery ligation. More recently， suture methods that attempt to compress the uterus， such as the B-lynch stitch， have been described. If these fail， hysterectomy may be lifesaving.\n\n【30】Other causes of early PPH include genital tract lacerations， which should be sus-pected with a firm contracted uterus while bleeding persists. The vaginal side walls and cervix should be especially carefully inspected. Repair of the complete extent of the laceration is important. Uterine inversion 删除25：<u></u>， whether partial or complete， must also be considered. Placental causes include accreta or retained placenta. If the uterus is firm and there are no lacerations， one must also consider coagulopathy.\n\n【31】Secondary (late) PPH， defined as occurring after the first 24 hours， may be caused by subinvolution of the placental site， usually occurring at 10 to 14 days after delivery. In this disorder， the eschar over the placental bed usually falls off and the 删除换行1 lack of myometrial contraction at the site leads to bleeding. Classically， the patient will not have bleeding until about 2 weeks after delivery and is not significantly anemic. Oral ergot alkaloid and careful follow-up is the standard treatment； other options include intravenous dilute oxytocin or intramuscular prostaglandin F，-alpha compounds.\n\n【32】Other causes of secondary postpartum hemorrhage include uterine atony (per-haps secondary to retained products of conception) and infection. Ultrasound examination helps to confirm the diagnosis. If uterus is atonic， uterotonic agents are the first-line therapy. If suspecting retained products of conception， suction dilation and curettage can be performed. Women with retained products of con-ception (POCs) generally have uterine cramping and bleeding. If suspecting infec-tion (endometritis)， broad-spectrum antibiotics are indicated. Endometritis is sus-pected with uterine fundal tenderness， fever， and foul-smelling lochia.\n\n【33】Emerging Concepts\n\n【34】Recent studies have indicated that active management of the third stage of labor reduces the incidence and severity of PPH. This includes oxytocin given immedi-ately upon delivery of the infant， late cord clamping， and gentle cord traction with uterine countertraction with a well-contracted uterus. Several randomized trials found a 25% to 50% decrease in the incidence of PPH. Although retained placenta is a theoretical risk with early oxytocin administration， studies have not found this complication.\n删除16：<u>CASE CORRELATION\n删除25：<u>See also Case 3， Uterine Inversion， which is strongly associated with postpar-tum hemorrhage； see also Section I—Approach to Reading and What Is the Most Likely Diagnosis-for the clinical approach.</u>\n</u>",

She had a history of a normal pubertal development with onset of menarche at age 12. Her menses were regular until age 20 when the intermenstrual interval shortened. She then experienced amenorrhea and galactorrhea associated with headaches and visual disturbance at age 21. At age 22 she was seen by her ophthalmologist who noted bitemporal hemianopsia, and an MRI revealed a large 4.2 × 3.4 × 3.5 cm sellar and suprasellar mass consistent with a pituitary macroadenoma. Hormonal evaluation demonstrated hyperprolactinemia 7000 ng/ml associated with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with low follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) 2 IU/L, luteinizing hormone (LH) 1 IU/L, and a prepubertal estradiol level 22 pg/mL. In addition, she had evidence of central hypothyroidism with a low thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) of 0.1 mIU/L and low free T4 of 0.6 ng/dL. Her remaining pituitary-adrenal axis testing was within normal limits with an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level of 15 pg/mL and morning cortisol of 10 μg/dL. The patient was placed on a dopamine agonist (DA), cabergoline 0.5 mg biweekly, and her prolactin level decreased to 500 ng/mL after 3 months. After 1 year, her prolactin level had decreased to 250 ng/mL, but did not normalize (goal <10) despite increasing the dose of the DA and spreading the dosing across the week for the potential rapid metabolism of the medication. Her menses did not return. MRI imaging demonstrated resolution of the intra- and suprasellar components of the mass with residual tumor in the bilateral cavernous sinuses. Surgery was considered but was not thought to be an option. Radiation therapy also was considered. She presented to the endocrine clinic to discuss optimal sex hormone therapy now and in the future.\n\n【11】Introduction: Incidence, Prevalence, and Implications\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】The prevalence of sex hormone deficiency can be as high as 95% in patients presenting with sellar tumors, as well as after surgery or radiotherapy for sellar lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Central hypogonadism is also prevalent for patients who have had cranial irradiation for other brain lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Hyperprolactinemia directly secreted from the tumor, stalk compression, or medications is a common cause of central hypogonadism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. There are limited studies of the long-term impact of sex steroid deficiency in patients with hypopituitarism. However, untreated gonadotropin deficiency is an independent factor adversely affecting mortality (hazard ratio, 1.86 \\[99% CI, 1.15–2.45\\]) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. In contrast, sex steroid replacement has been associated with a significantly reduced standard mortality ratio (SMR) (1.42 \\[99% CI, 0.97–2.07\\] vs 2.97 \\[99% CI, 2.13–4.13\\]), although men and women were not considered separately 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. A more recent meta-analysis of 12 studies in the literature of 23,000 patients confirmed an increased excess mortality (SMR 1.55; 95% CI 1.14–2.11) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Risk factors included younger age at diagnosis, female gender, and hypogonadism as well as a diagnosis of craniopharyngioma, radiation therapy, transcranial therapy, and diabetes insipidus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】Although there are no longitudinal studies in women with hypopituitarism and selective gonadotropin deficiency resulting in prolonged estrogen deficiency, premature ovarian insufficiency as a model of sex hormone deficiency is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. Studies suggest that bilateral oophorectomy without estrogen replacement before the age of 45 years increases cardiovascular mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 10 \\]</u>. In patients with central hypogonadism, there is a reported SMR of 2.09 (95% CI, 0.94–4.65) in females with untreated gonadotropin deficiency compared to a SMR of 0.94 (95% CI, 0.35–2.49) in those with treated hypogonadism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Physiology and Pathophysiology\n------------------------------\n\n【15】The normal control of the reproductive axis in women is complex with changes during pubertal development to mature the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis and then across the menstrual cycle to control ovulatory cycles 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 13 \\]</u>. The exact constellation of factors controlling the onset of puberty in the female is still not clear, but the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis in the human is activated postnatally and then repressed at about 6 months to allow childhood growth. The repression of the axis is mediated by neurotransmitters, but with onset of sexual maturation; kisspeptin neurons activate gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons in the hypothalamus to release GnRH in an episodic fashion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. GnRH then travels down the median eminence of the pituitary to activate the transcription of the α subunit, FSHβ, and LHβ subunit genes to produce the functional heterodimeric gonadotropins, FSH and LH. These hormones then act at the ovary to produce androgens, estrogens, and progesterone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】The first sign of puberty in girls is breast development under the control of estrogens, which increase glandular development 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Only later in puberty, when progesterone is secreted from the corpus luteum, do the breasts mature fully with differentiation of ductules. This is important to remember when inducing pubertal development in a girl with congenital hypopituitarism or acquired before pubertal completion. Unlike males who have a fairly static GnRH-induced LH pulse pattern of secretion, in females the pattern must change across the monthly cycle to induce folliculogenesis, trigger ovulation, and then ensure normal luteal function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. This pattern is mimicked when attempting to induce ovulation for pregnancy. When hormone therapy is considered to induce sexual maturation, estrogen alone for a period of time is used to optimally develop breast glandular development, and then progestin added intermittently after menses begin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】In the adult woman with central hypogonadism because of pituitary disease, one may consider physiologic hormone therapy regimens with cyclic estrogen and progestin: however, often the patient can be placed on a low-dose oral contraceptive to ensure optimal estrogen replacement for convenience 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 , 18 \\]</u>. Consideration of hormone therapy for the menopausal woman with hypopituitarism is similar to that of all symptomatic menopausal women based on individual risks and benefits 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 , 20 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】Diagnostic Testing and Monitoring\n---------------------------------\n\n【19】In the patient from the case presentation, there is the consideration that, if her prolactin is normalized , the reproductive axis may reactivate without intervention if the tumor has not caused additional compressive damage to the gonadotrophs. If the tumor is large and the prolactin decreasing slowly, replacement of the sex hormones with an oral contraceptive can be useful to maintain menstrual cyclicity, provide contraception, and provide target tissues with optimal estrogen action 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 21 \\]</u>. If the prolactin level cannot be normalized, often libido is not improved with sex steroid replacement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Estrogen at high doses may increase prolactin levels, but effects of physiologic sex hormone replacement therapy or even low-dose oral contraceptive agents have minimal effects in clinical practice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】Diagnostic testing in our patient would be to confirm low FSH, LH, and estradiol, inability to normalize the prolactin, treatment of the central hypothyroidism, and, if present, cortisol deficiency. No further monitoring of the reproductive axis hormone levels is needed in patients treated with oral contraceptives . If low-dose estrogen and progestin are chosen as a therapeutic intervention, then a transdermal or oral estradiol preparation can be administered, with the ability to target an estradiol level to the early to mid-follicular phase range. A progesterone component given intermittently is needed to ensure endometrial shedding, such as medroxyprogesterone 5 mg or micronized progesterone 200 mg on days 1–12 of each month. There are no studies of the long-term outcome of cyclic or continuous low-dose hormone therapy in young women compared to postmenopausal women given these regimens 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>. Recent meta-analysis of effects of hormone therapy in menopausal women suggests that daily progestin increases the risk of breast cancer compared to intermittent or no progestin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 \\]</u>. Thus, this author’s recommendation is to use intermittent progestin days 1–12 each month rather than continuous dosing if this regimen is chosen instead of oral contraceptives for women with hypopituitarism in their reproductive years.\n\n【21】Management of Sex Steroids in Women with Hypopituitarism\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【22】### Prepubertal/Pubertal Patients\n\n【23】To induce pubertal development if the patient has congenital hypopituitarism or acquired during childhood, the goal is to replicate the timing and process of sex steroid action to develop secondary sexual characteristics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Therefore, one should not immediately prescribe an oral contraceptive or cyclic estrogen/progestin. If no breast development has occurred, estrogen alone is given in a “staircasing” escalation as occurs with normal pubertal development. The estrogen patches which come in doses from 0.025 to 0.1 mg weekly or biweekly can be useful to induce breast development. Oral estradiol can be used, but it has more of a peak and trough pattern, and one solution is to split it to twice daily dosing to mimic a more continuous level . The estradiol alone is given for 6–18 months until vaginal bleeding occurs . The onset of vaginal bleeding suggests endometrial stimulation has occurred and progestin, either natural progestin (Prometrium) 200 mg days 1–12, or medroxyprogesterone, 5 mg days 1–12 each month, is added to the continuous estrogen therapy . Once vaginal bleeding is occurring, many providers will switch the patient to a low-dose oral contraceptive. The packaging of the contraceptive facilitates compliance, and the adolescent can feel more like her peers who are on similar hormonal therapy, albeit for alternative reasons. Regular follow-up visits to a primary care or gynecologist are suggested for any woman on hormonal therapy or oral contraceptives especially when sexually active 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 , 19 \\]</u>.\nTable 23.1 删除换行 Estrogen/progesterone replacement in female patients with hypogonadism\n\n| Life stage  | Goals  | Potential regimens  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Adolescent female  | Estrogen replacement to induce breast development 6–18 months prior to addition of cyclical progestin once menstrual bleeding commences  | Transdermal estradiol patch (titration 0.025 mg to 0.1 mg) Oral progestin (medroxyprogesterone acetate 5 mg, micronized progesterone 200 mg days, norethindrone 1 mg) for days 1–12 per month Oral estrogen and progestin containing contraceptive pills once menstrual cycles commence  |\n| Pre-menopausal adult female  | Estrogen replacement combined with progestin to protect the endometrium  | Oral estradiol and progestin containing contraceptive pills Transdermal estrogen with daily intermittent progestin days 1–12 of the month Oral estradiol with progestin containing intrauterine device  |\n| Menopausal female a  | Estrogen replacement combined with progestin to protect the endometrium if uterus still present  | Oral estrogen or transdermal estrogen combined with progestin days 1–12 of the month or continuous daily progestin Combined estrogen/progestin transdermal preparation Additional systemic estrogen therapies include gels, creams, sprays which would need to be used with a progestin to protect the endometrium Lower-dose vaginal estrogen preparations include cream, tablet, ring for vaginal and urinary tract symptoms of hypoestrogeniemia  |\n\n【25】<sup>a </sup> After careful assessment of individual risks and benefits including breast cancer, metabolic bone disease, hypertension, hypercoagulability, smoking, cardiometabolic disease, and personal symptoms of hot flashes, painful intercourse, urinary frequency, sleep, and cognitive issues\n\n【26】### Adult Patients\n\n【27】If the patient develops hypopituitarism after sexual maturation, as in our case presentation , the goal is to replace gonadal sex steroids in a convenient manner. Although some advocate continued use of physiologic sex hormone therapy, the cost of this therapy in comparison to oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) as well as convenience may alter the patient’s preference. Some have argued that oral estrogen may suppress the insulin-like growth factor (IGF-)1 response to growth hormone and might then attenuate metabolic responses to growth hormone therapy if the patient is on this regimen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>, although no head to head studies have been performed. Dosing of growth hormone in a patient with hypopituitarism may have to be adjusted in the presence of concomitant oral estrogen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 \\]</u>. Thyroid hormone levels may also need to be adjusted in women on any type of estrogen therapy and when this is discontinued after menopausal age.\n\n【28】The goal is to maintain sex hormone levels to estrogen target tissues including the bones , the cardiovascular system, sexual function, cognition, and mental health . There have been no prospective controlled studies comparing risk/benefit of different types of hormonal replacement strategies. Obviously, if the patient has contraindications to oral contraceptives, then low-dose hormonal therapy would be the treatment of choice, usually with transdermal estrogen preparations .\n\n【29】### Menopausal Patients\n\n【30】As the woman with hypopituitarism enters her 40s, discussion of the type of hormonal therapy should be reconsidered . Smoking, hypertension, obesity, and diabetes may increase the risk of oral contraceptives as the mode of hormonal therapy and trigger the switch to a lower-dose sex hormone regimen which can be provided with oral or transdermal estrogens and cyclic progestin to protect the endometrium. If the woman has had a hysterectomy, only estrogen is administered. There are no specific studies that examine risk/benefit of menopausal hormone therapy in women with hypopituitarism. Discussion of individual risk factors for breast cancer, metabolic bone disease, cardiometabolic diseases and personal symptoms of hot flashes, painful intercourse, urinary frequency, sleep, and cognitive issues when not prescribed estrogen is an issue for the patient to review with her provider. The advantage of using the estrogen patches for hormonal therapy in the menopause is the availability of a stepwise decrease in dose potencies to taper hormonal therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. Thyroid replacement dosing for central hypothyroidism will often need to be decreased as a woman reduces and stops estrogen therapy. Routine health monitoring for all women with hypopituitarism should include control of hypertension, performance of lipid panel, hemoglobin A1c, mammograms, bone densitometry , and colonoscopies as recommended by health guidelines and individual risk based upon family history 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. The Endocrine Society and the International Consensus guidelines recommend against the routine prescribing of testosterone to women with hypopituitarism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 , 26 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】Regarding the patient in the case presentation, we attempted to normalize her prolactin levels with various dosage regimens of cabergoline 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 27 \\]</u> . We discussed the variable options for sex hormone therapy, and she chose to start oral contraceptive therapy with ethinyl estradiol 30 μg and norethindrone 1 mg daily. Her menses returned and were regular at monthly intervals lasting 3 days . Her thyroid hormone replacement dose was increased to target the free T4 to the top one-third of the normal range 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 28 \\]</u> . Retesting of her adrenal axis was performed due to effects of estrogen on serum cortisol levels. She will be referred to reproductive gynecology for induction of ovulation  when she desires fertility and will need to follow with an endocrinologist during and after her pregnancy as well as across her lifespan.",

Initially she did not 删除换行1 pay much attention to it but she has had several episodes and it now occurs most days. It 删除换行1 is generally light but for a few days recently it was almost like a period. There is no associated pain. The woman has never married or been sexually active. She has no previous 删除换行1 gynaecological history and has never had a smear test. She was diagnosed with type 2 删除换行1 diabetes 4 years ago for which she takes oral hypoglycaemics. However she is not very 删除换行1 compliant with diet modification, and her blood glucose is not well controlled such that 删除换行1 starting insulin is being considered.\n\n【3】Examination\n\n【4】The woman is obese with a body mass index of 32 kg/m2 删除换行1 . Her blood pressure is 删除换行1 150/80 mmHg. The abdomen is non-tender, but due to her adiposity it is not possible to 删除换行1 feel abdominal masses.\n\n【5】External genital examination is unremarkable. Speculum and bimanual examination are 删除换行1 not performed as she has never been sexually active.\n\n【6】Transvaginal ultrasound was not possible and a transabdominal ultrasound examination 删除换行1 was therefore performed with a full bladder.\n\n【7】Transabdominal ultrasound report: the uterus is normal size and anteverted. The 删除换行1 endometrium could not be clearly visualized. Both ovaries appear normal. Ultrasound view 删除换行1 was restricted by patient adiposity.\n\n【8】Examination under anaesthetic and hysteroscopy: the vagina and cervix appear normal.\n\n【9】Hysteroscopy showed an irregular vascular mass arising from the uterine wall with contact 删除换行1 bleeding. Curettage was performed and products sent for histological examination.\n\n【10】The findings at hysteroscopy are shown in Fig. 22.1.\n\n【11】INVESTIGATIONS\n\n【12】Questions\n\n【13】• What is the likely diagnosis?\n\n【14】• If this is confirmed how would you manage this patient?\n\n【15】删除3：<u>Figure 22.1 Hysteroscopy findings.

In many cases the diagnosis turns out to be benign. However, in this 删除换行1 case early suspicion is raised by the risk factors for endometrial carcinoma:\n\n【19】• type 2 diabetes\n\n【20】• obesity\n\n【21】• nulliparity.\n\n【22】There is also a long history of significant bleeding suggesting a more significant pathology. In women who can tolerate the examination, the diagnosis may be made by outpatient endometrial sampling. In this case however, the inability to examine properly meant 删除换行1 it was appropriate to investigate the uterine cavity and the rest of the lower genital tract 删除换行1 under anaesthetic. The diagnosis of endometrial cancer was confirmed on histology report 删除换行1 from the curettage specimen.\n\n【23】Management\n\n【24】Management of endometrial carcinoma is simple total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingoophorectomy, as 90 per cent of women present with early-stage disease.\n\n【25】Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan prior to the procedure may be carried out to 删除换行1 check for possible lymph node involvement, in which case lymph node biopsy should be 删除换行1 performed at the time of surgery.

        "text": "【0】CASE 38: PASSED OUT DURING BOXING\n\n【1】History\n\n【2】A 17-year-old male student is brought to the Emergency Department after being punched  删除换行1 from the side in a boxing match. He passed out but quickly regained consciousness. He complains of a throbbing headache and nausea, and has also vomited twice.\n\n【3】Examination\n\n【4】Screening cervical spine, central and peripheral nerve exams are normal. Abbreviated mental test score is 9/10.\n\n【5】Questions\n\n【6】1. Would you order a CT scan of the head? Justify your answer.\n\n【7】2. What other aspects of his history are important to explore?\n\n【8】3. What advice would you give the patient and his parents?\n\n【9】DISCUSSION\n\n【10】The basic principles of Advanced Trauma Life Support should be applied when dealing with  删除换行1 this patient. Major injuries to rule out include cervical spine fractures or ligamentous injuries,  删除换行1 intracranial bleeding and blunt cerebrovascular injuries. Imaging studies are not necessary  删除换行1 in all cases, but should be considered if the clinical suspicion is high. The NICE guidelines on  删除换行1 head injury state that a CT scan is indicated if any of the following are present:\n\n【11】• GCS < 13 on initial assessment\n\n【12】• GCS < 15 at 2 hours after injury on assessment in the Emergency Department\n\n【13】• Suspected open or depressed skull fracture\n\n【14】• Any sign of basal skull fracture\n\n【15】• Post-traumatic seizure\n\n【16】• Focal neurological deficit\n\n【17】• More than one episode of vomiting since the head injury\n\n【18】• Dangerous mechanism of injury\n\n【19】• Anti-coagulant use (e.g. warfarin, NOACs)\n\n【20】• >30 minutes of retrograde amnesia\n\n【21】In this case, as the patient has vomited twice post head injury, a non-contrast CT scan of  删除换行1 the head would be indicated to rule out skull fracture and/or subdural haematoma with the  删除换行1 lateral head injury. The CT scan in this case is normal.\n\n【22】Concussion is typically managed in the outpatient setting. While the most important aspects  删除换行1 of the ED encounter include ruling out life- and limb-threatening injuries, establishing a  删除换行1 diagnosis of concussion can have profound impact on the long-term outcomes of the individual. A suspicion of concussion should prompt a referral to a concussion expert. Depending  删除换行1 on local practice, this could be a General Practitioner with an interest in sports medicine, a  删除换行1 neurologist or a neurosurgeon. In larger centres, these specialists often work together in the  删除换行1 evaluation and management of the patient.\n\n【23】The patient should be advised to avoid contact or collision sports until further evaluation and  删除换行1 clearance by a concussion specialist. Young athletes in particular should not be allowed to  删除换行1 return to play due to the risk of Second Impact Syndrome. In the acute period after a concussion, the patient is particularly vulnerable to further injury as a result of impaired reaction  删除换行1 and decision-making abilities.\n\n【24】One of the key elements to establish is the concussion history of the patient. A history of multiple concussions, each with progressively longer recovery times, should prompt warning to  删除换行1 the patient that further injury could lead to substantially greater morbidity and mortality. The  删除换行1 effects of performance-enhancing drugs and illicit substance use in a concussed individual  删除换行1 are controversial but should be taken into account, and screening should be considered. The  删除换行1 use of helmets, while protective to a certain extent, does little to prevent rotational injuries.\n\n【25】No treatment has been proven to speed recovery from a concussion. Some advocate for strict  删除换行1 rest (no physical activities, no reading, no television/computers/phones) for 5–7 days, but  删除换行1 compliance will be an issue. Others have suggested an early active rehabilitation approach  删除换行1 including strict rest in the first day or two, followed by the gradual introduction of mental  删除换行1 activities and subsequently progressively intense physical activities.\n\n【26】In this case, with a negative CT scan, the patient should be discharged, provided there is  删除换行1 someone on hand to supervise him at home, with both written and verbal instructions of the 139\n\n【27】Case 38: Passed out during boxing 删除换行1 normal symptoms of concussion and red flags such as increased drowsiness, seizures, focal  删除换行1 neurology and ongoing vomiting. Should the patient deteriorate at home or if the carer is  删除换行1 concerned, they should return to the ED for reassessment. On occasion, patients may have  删除换行1 delayed bleeds, which may necessitate re-scanning.\n\n【28】Key Points\n\n【29】• Rule out life- and limb-threatening injuries when dealing with a suspected concussion injury.\n\n【30】• Establish a diagnosis of concussion based on high clinical suspicion.\n\n【31】• Refer the patient to a concussion specialist for further outpatient evaluation and  删除换行1 management.\n\n【32】• Always discharge patients with head injury into the care of a relative with both  删除换行1 verbal and written head injury instructions detailing normal concussive symptoms  删除换行1 and when to return to the ED.删除9：<u>http://taylorandfrancis.com141</u>",

She had abdominal striae， facial round-ing and erythema， dorsocervical pad， and supracla-vicular pads.\n\n【4】INVESTIGATIONS\n\n【5】After confirmation of ACTH-independent hypercorti-solism ， abdominal imaging was obtained. Ablominal computed tomography demonstrated bilateral adrenal nodules， 2.6 cm on the right and2.8 cm on the left 删除33：<u></u>. As imaging phenotype was not consistent with bilateral macronodular hyper-plasia， AVS was performed to identify the source of autonomous cortisol secretion. In preparation for the AVS procedure， dexamethasone 0.5 mg was initiated on the morning the day prior and every 6 hours， including the morning of AVS. Cosyntropin (which is commonly infused during AVS in patients with pri-mary aldosteronism) was not administered. Concen-trations of cortisol and epinephrine were measured in inferior vena cava (IVC) and both adrenal veins (Box18.1). Based on the left adrenal yein-to-IVC cortisol ratio of 17.2 and the left adrenal vein to right adrenal vein cortisol ratio of 3.9， ACTH-independent hyper-cortisolism due to the dominant left adrenal adenoma was diagnosed， and left adrenalectomy was recom-mended. However， the patient was advised that she may continue to demonstrate a mild autonomous cor-tisol secretion from the right adrenal adenoma， given the right adrenal vein to inferior vena cava ratio of 4.4.\n\n| TABLE 18.1  | Laboratory Tests  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  | Reference  |\n| Biochemical Test  |  | Result  | Range  |\n| Morning cortisol， mcg/dL  |  | 22  | 7-25  |\n| ACTH，pg/mL  |  | <5  | 7.2-63  |\n| DHEA-S， mcg/dL  |  | <15  | 18-284  |\n| Aldosterone，ng/dL  |  | 4  | <21  |\n| Plasma renin activity，ng/mL  |  | <0.6  | 2.9-10.8  |\n| per hour  |  |  |  |\n| Plasma metanephrine， nmol/L  |  | 0.21  | <0.5  |\n| Plasma normetanephrine， nmol/L  |  | 0.6  | <0.9  |\n| Urine free cortisol， mcg/24 h  |  | 373  | 3.5-45  |\n\n【7】ACTH， Corticotropin； DHEA-S， dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate.\n\n【8】删除3：<u>Fig. 18.1 Axial (top) and coronal (bottom) images from a contrast enhanced computed tomography scan showed bilateral adrenal masses， 2.6 cm on the right and 2.8 cm on the left .</u>\n\n【9】BOX 18.1 ADRENAL VENOUS SAMPLINGa\n\n|  | Right AV  | VC  | Left AV  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Epinephrine，pg/dLb  | 3905  | 69  | 1796  |\n| Cortisol，mcg/dL  | 74  | 17  | 292  |\n| Cortiso AV/VC ratio  | 4.4  |  | 17.2  |\n| Cortiso RAV/LAV ratio  | 3.9  |  |  |\n\n【11】aAVS completed under continuous dexamethasone suppres-sion of 0.5 mg every 6 hours started 24 hours before the AVS. bAdrenal vein epinephrine concentrations of at least 100 pg/mL more than concentrations in the inferior vena cava were used to confirm successful adrenal vein cannulation.\n\n【12】Interpretation： Cortisol AV/IVC ratio >6.5 confirms autono-mous cortisol secretion from the adrenal gland， while cortisol AV/IVC ratio <3.3 excludes it.

She was very pleased with res-olution of diabetes mellitus type 2 and hypertension， weight loss of 20 pounds， and a significant improve-ment in anxiety. Two years after left adrenalectomy， abdominal imaging was repeated and redemonstrated a right 2.6-cm stable adrenal adenoma.

While macronodular hyperplasia presents with bilateral cortisol secretion， this may not be the case in a patient with bilateral adenomas (when one adrenal adenoma may be cortisol-secreting， while 删除换行1 the other one is nonfunctioning). AVS in these situa-tions can be useful， as illustrated in this case.1.2 Adre-nal vein cortisol ratio >2.3 in these cases identifies the culprit lesion.2 Notably， in patients with bilateral adenomas of unequal size， cortisol secretion usually originates from the much larger adrenal mass， and in these cases， AVS may not be needed.\n删除3：<u>Fig.18.2 Gross anatomy of left adrenal gland： well-circumscribed pig- mented adrenal cortical adenoma measuring 2.8×2.3 cm.</u>\n\n【16】Key Points\n\n【17】●Adrenal imaging is the first step to determine the etiology of ACTH-independent hypercortisolism.\n\n【18】● AVS under dexamethasone suppression， with cortisol and epinephrine measurements， is useful in patients with ACTH-independent hypercorti-solism and imaging suggestive of bilateral adrenal adenomas.\n\n【19】●AVS is not indicated in patients with unilateral adenoma， bilateral micronodular hyperplasia， or macronodular hyperplasia.\n\n【20】●AVS may not be useful in patients with bilateral adenomas with significant differences in size(>2 cm)， as cortisol secretion usually originates from the larger adrenal mass.",

She was trying to conceive for 18 months prior to this pregnancy.\n\n【3】Her estimated delivery date was corrected after her 11–14-week scan to make her now 40  删除换行1 weeks and 6 days. All pregnancy blood tests and ultrasound scans have been normal. The  删除换行1 baby was breech at 34 weeks but cephalic at 37 weeks.\n\n【4】This morning she had a mucus-like dark red discharge followed by the onset of irregular  删除换行1 period-type pains. Two hours ago she felt a gush of clear fluid from the vagina and since then  删除换行1 pains have become much more severe now occurring every 4 min, lasting for 45 s.\n\n【5】The baby has moved normally during the day.\n\n【6】She had a bath at home and took paracetamol but is now distressed and has come to hospital  删除换行1 for assessment. Her partner and sister who are both very anxious accompany her.\n\n【7】Examination\n\n【8】On examination she is comfortable between pains. Her blood pressure is 129/76 mmHg and  删除换行1 pulse 101/min. Symphysiofundal height is 37 cm and the fetus is cephalic with 2/5 palpable.\n\n【9】Speculum examination shows clear fluid pooled in the posterior vaginal fornix.\n\n【10】Vaginal examination reveals the cervix to be fully effaced and 4 cm dilated. The position is  删除换行1 right occipitoposterior and the head is 2 cm above the ischial spines. There is no fetal caput  删除换行1 or moulding.\n\n【11】INVESTIGATIONS\n\n【12】Urinalysis: blood ++\n\n【13】Proteinuria: +\n\n【14】Leucocytes: negative\n\n【15】Nitrites: negative\n\n【16】Questions\n\n【17】• What is the diagnosis?\n\n【18】• What is the appropriate management?\n\n【19】ANSWER 89\n\n【20】This woman is in normal labour.\n Definition of labour\n\n【21】The onset of regular painful contractions with progressive dilatation of the cervix and  删除换行1 descent of the presenting part.\n\n【22】Spontaneous rupture of membranes has occurred but is not necessary for the diagnosis of labour.\n\n【23】The woman’s observations and examination findings are normal for labour:\n\n【24】• the dark mucus discharge is a ‘show’ and is not a cause for concern unless the bleeding is fresh or ongoing\n\n【25】• the pulse is almost certainly raised secondarily to the pain\n\n【26】• the haematuria and proteinuria are secondary to contamination by the show and liquor\n\n【27】• the symphysiofundal height is low because the head has descended into the pelvis  删除换行1 and because the liquor has been released from the uterus.\n\n【28】Management\n\n【29】The pregnancy and labour are low risk in that there is no evidence of any fetal or maternal  删除换行1 disorder that requires doctor-led care. The woman should therefore remain under midwifeled care and does not need continuous electronic fetal monitoring (cardiotocograph (CTG)).\nThe fetus does need assessment for wellbeing with intermittent auscultation for a full minute  删除换行1 after a contraction at least every 15 min in the first stage of labour and for a full minute after  删除换行1 a contraction every 5 min in the second stage of labour.\n\n【30】The progress of the labour should be recorded on a partogram, which should include maternal and fetal observations.\n Monitoring in low-risk labour\n\n【31】• Hourly blood pressure\n\n【32】• Hourly heart rate\n\n【33】• Four-hourly examinations for cervical dilatation\n\n【34】• Assessment for meconium\n\n【35】Once labour is established, expected dilatation is approximately 1 cm/h. If this does not  删除换行1 occur or if signs suggest that fetal or maternal wellbeing might be compromised, then medical assessment and possible intervention may be indicated.\n\n【36】KEY POINTS\n\n【37】• Normal labour is the onset of regular painful contractions with progressive dilatation of the cervix and descent of the presenting part.\n\n【38】• Continuous CTG is not required for low-risk women in normal labour, but intermittent auscultation is essential.\n删除测试1：<u>Case 90: Pain in pregnancy\n\n【39】</u>",

USPSTF recommends routine screening for colorectal cancer in all adults starting at the age of 50.\n\n【2】B. USPSTF recommends stopping screening for cervical cancer with Pap smear in all women past the age of 65.\n\n【3】C.The USPSTF recommends that all men should be screened for prostate cancer with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing annually starting at the age of 50.\n\n【4】D.

All women with strong risk factors， regardless of age， should be screened for osteoporosis.\n\n【13】B.Only women above the age of 65 should be screened for osteoporosis.\n\n【14】C. Men and women above the age of 65 should be screened for osteoporo-sis.\n\n【15】D. African-American race is an independent risk factor for osteoporosis and should warrant screening regardless of other risk factors.\n\n【16】ANSWERS\n\n【17】18.1 F A. The only accurate answer among the choices is that regarding colorectal screening. There is no recommendation for annual routine PSA testing for prostate cancer screening. Pap smears can be safely discontinued in women over the age of 65 who have had adequate prior screening. The herpes zoster vaccine is recommended for routine use at age 60 or older.\n\n【18】18.2 C. Up to one-third of people older than age 65 suffer from hearing loss.Pres-bycusis typically presents with symmetric high-frequency hearing loss. There is loss of speech discrimination， so that patients complain of difficulty under-standing rapid speech， foreign accents， and conversation in noisy areas. The mechanism is sensorineural rather than a conductive problem.\n\n【19】18.3A. USPSTF recommends screening for osteoporosis in women above 65 years and younger than 65 years with risk factors. Therefore， considering age as a risk factor， essentially all women with risk factors must be screened for osteoporosis with bone mineral density test or DEXA scan. The current recommendation applies only to women， as there is insufficient evidence to support screening in men， and the race mostly at risk is Caucasian.\n\n【20】CLINICALPEARLS\n\n【21】Protein undernutrition is associated with an increased risk of infections. anemia， orthostatic hypotension， and decubitus ulcers.\nSmoking is associated with osteoporosis.\n\n【22】If\"osteoporotic”fractures， such as vertebral compression fractures，occur in conjunction with osteopenia on x-ray， the diagnosis ofosteoporosis is almost certain.\n\n【23】Hearing loss and sensory impairments， in general， can be confused with cognitive impairment or an affective disorder.\n\n【24】Presbyopia， macular degeneration， glaucoma， cataracts， and diabetic retinopathy account for the majority of conditions leading to vision loss in the elderly.",

        "text": "【0】CASE 31: SOMETHING’S NOT QUITE RIGHT\n\n【1】History\n\n【2】A 24-year-old man’s parents bring him to see you. Up until a few months ago he seemed to  删除换行1 be doing well and there were no concerns. He was in the second year of his PhD, but then  删除换行1 apparently quite suddenly lost interest in his academic work and also stopped socializing  删除换行1 with his friends. He returned to live at home and has been increasingly more withdrawn at  删除换行1 home. He is speaking less and less and is becoming apathetic and rarely shows any emotion  删除换行1 or engagement with anyone including his family members with whom he had been reasonably close. When asked how he is, the man insists he is fine and he cannot understand his  删除换行1 parents’ concern. When asked about what they think is wrong, his parents cannot say what  删除换行1 concerns them, but they are sure something is not right.\n\n【3】Mental state examination\n\n【4】His eye contact is variable and when he does make eye contact it is fixed but there is no sense  删除换行1 of rapport with you. He is a polite and reasonably cooperative man. He does not appear  删除换行1 anxious or agitated but appears rather flat in affect. He seems slightly detached from his  删除换行1 parents and does not look at them. His speech appears normal, but he does at times struggle  删除换行1 to answer even quite basic questions and his responses are short. He describes his mood as  删除换行1 ‘fine’ and denies any self-harm ideation. He does not look depressed but seems detached and  删除换行1 in a world of his own. He denies any hallucinations or delusions. There is no evidence of any  删除换行1 thought disorder, although he says very little so this is difficult to elicit. He is orientated in  删除换行1 time, place and person. His serial sevens testing is poor, but his parents say he has never been  删除换行1 good at mathematics.\n\n【5】You then call (with his consent) his university tutor who reports that a few months prior to  删除换行1 him leaving university and returning home, it was brought to the tutor’s attention by his  删除换行1 peers that there had been episodes of strange and erratic behaviour. By the time the university health service saw him, the episodes seemed to have settled, but it was suggested he  删除换行1 would benefit from a break.\n\n【6】Questions\n\n【7】• What is the differential diagnosis?\n\n【8】• How would you manage this case?\n\n【9】ANSWER 31\n\n【10】The man needs to be assessed and he will need to be seen alone. If he has capacity, his consent  删除换行1 is required to share information about his care with his parents. You will need to ask about  删除换行1 any changes in mood, any experience of perceptual abnormality, any evidence of delusions  删除换行1 and any changes in behaviour. A risk assessment is also needed.\n\n【11】The differential diagnoses will include depression, substance misuse, schizophrenia presenting with negative symptoms, autism spectrum disorder (extremely unlikely as onset appears  删除换行1 to be recent and autism spectrum disorder would have displayed features from before age 3) 删除换行1 and possible organic causes.\n\n【12】The most likely diagnoses are depression or schizophrenia. This man appears to be presenting with the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, but it is important not to jump too quickly  删除换行1 to conclusions as making this diagnosis has a number of weighty implications for this man  删除换行1 and his family. Make sure that other possibilities are excluded.\n\n【13】Although there are no tests that can diagnose schizophrenia, simple blood and urine tests  删除换行1 can rule out other medical causes of symptoms. Brain imaging studies, such as magnetic  删除换行1 resonance imaging or a computed tomography scan, can exclude other rare problems such  删除换行1 as space-occupying lesions. A thorough history and blood screen could exclude any missed  删除换行1 systemic illness such as anaemia or hypothyroidism.\n\n【14】The management of this man would depend on the final diagnosis. Initial treatment may  删除换行1 focus on psychosocial interventions including psychoeducation, activity scheduling, family  删除换行1 therapy and cognitive behaviour therapy. Other aspects of treatment include the development of coping strategies and helping him function the best he can whatever the symptoms  删除换行1 are. Depression would warrant antidepressants, and a diagnosis of schizophrenia would  删除换行1 involve treatment with antipsychotic medication, although compliance may be an issue as  删除换行1 the man does not believe he is unwell. Psychosocial interventions would allow a period of  删除换行1 monitoring before deciding on medication. Antipsychotics appear less effective in reducing negative symptoms than positive ones. Educating and supporting the family are also  删除换行1 important components of care. It is very important that patients stay in treatment even after \n\n【15】Negative symptoms and signs of schizophrenia\n\n【16】• Avolition and low energy – the person tends to sit around and sleep much more  删除换行1 than normal, lacks interest in life and has poor motivation.\n\n【17】• Affective flattening – a blank, blunted facial expression or less lively facial movements, flat voice (lack of normal intonations and variance) or physical movements  删除换行1 and poverty of emotional expression compared to before.\n\n【18】• Alogia describes poverty of speech.\n\n【19】• Interest in others is reduced.\n\n【20】• Inability to make friends or keep friends.\n\n【21】• Social isolation.\n\n【22】• Poor self-care.\n\n【23】• Catatonia can present in a number of ways with profound effects on movement  删除换行1 and activity. There may be an apparent unawareness of the environment, near total  删除换行1 absence of motion and speech, aimless body movements and bizarre postures.\nCase 31: Something’s not quite right 删除换行1 recovery. Four out of five patients who stop taking their medication after a first episode of  删除换行1 schizophrenia will have a relapse. Relapse prevention work is therefore a key part of any  删除换行1 treatment programme.\n\n【24】Key Points\n\n【25】• Antipsychotic medication is less effective for the negative symptoms of schizophrenia; only with clozapine is there good evidence of significant effects on negative symptoms.\n\n【26】• Educating and supporting the family are key components of care.\n\n【27】删除测试2：<u>Case 32: Tricyclic antidepressant overdose\n\n【28】</u>",

He was playing squash when he suddenly felt as though he had been hit on the back of the  删除换行1 ankle. A loud snapping sound accompanied the pain.\n\n【3】Examination\n\n【4】Examination of the left foot and ankle reveals no obvious deformity. There is tenderness over  删除换行1 the calf and posterior aspect of the ankle. There is a full passive range of movement of the  删除换行1 foot,  ankle and knee joints. There are normal foot pulses, and neurological examination is  删除换行1 unremarkable.\n\n【5】Questions\n\n【6】• What clinical test is being demonstrated on a normal leg in Figure 67.1?\n\n【7】• What is the likely diagnosis in this patient?\n\n【8】• What investigation can be performed if the diagnosis is in question?\n\n【9】删除3：<u>Figure 67.1 Normal leg being tested.</u>\n\n【10】ANSWER 67\n\n【11】The clinical test that is being demonstrated is the ‘Simmonds test’. It describes the absence of  删除换行1 ankle plantar flexion when the calf is compressed. This picture demonstrates normal plantar  删除换行1 flexion with calf compression on the right leg.\n\n【12】Failure of plantar flexion indicates that the patient has ruptured his Achilles tendon. The history  删除换行1 of sudden pain affecting the calf during sporting activity is typical. Other examination findings  删除换行1 may include a palpable gap in the Achilles tendon and an inability to actively plantar flex the  删除换行1 ankle (i.e. the patient is unable to stand on ‘tip-toes’). The latter feature may be misleading, as  删除换行1 the deep flexors of the foot can compensate for this movement.\n\n【13】An ultrasound scan can confirm a gap in the Achilles tendon when the diagnosis is in doubt.\nSerial ultrasound scans can also be used to assess healing of the tendon. There is debate as to the  删除换行1 best way to treat this injury. Non-surgical management involves immobilizing the leg in a plaster  删除换行1 of Paris cast, with the foot initially in full plantar flexion. While this avoids the risks of surgery,  删除换行1 it delays functional rehabilitation and results in a greater risk of the tendon re-rupturing. The  删除换行1 tendon can be repaired surgically, which is thought to result in a stronger tendon repair. This  删除换行1 may be more appropriate for patients who require a greater level of sporting activity.\n\n【14】KEY POINTS\n\n【15】•\tUltrasound can be used to detect damage to the Achilles tendon.\n\n【16】•\tSimmonds test is diagnostic of an Achilles tendon rupture.删除个例：<u>Orthopaedic</u>",

The eruption  删除换行1 corresponds with the striae distensae and there is sparing of the umbilicus. She has a  删除换行1 few similar lesions over her upper thighs. She is normotensive and the remainder of her  删除换行1 examination is normal. It is of note that according to her antenatal notes she has gained  删除换行1 5 kg since her last antenatal check 3 weeks ago. Urine dipstick is negative.\n\n【6】删除3：<u>Figure 32.1</u>\n\n【7】Questions\n\n【8】• What is this eruption?\n\n【9】• What other diagnoses would you  删除换行1 consider?\n\n【10】• What are the implications for the baby?\nANSWER 32\n\n【11】This presentation with a very pruritic eruption beginning in the third trimester of the  删除换行1 first pregnancy and arising within the striae distensae (sparing the umbilicus) is typical of pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy (PUPPP), also referred to as  删除换行1 toxic erythema of pregnancy or polymorphic eruption of pregnancy. Over a few days the  删除换行1 eruption can become more widespread involving the trunk and extremities; less commonly, annular or polycyclic lesions develop. It is thought that maternal weight gain may  删除换行1 somehow precipitate the lesions. Anecdotally it is more often associated with male fetus  删除换行1 pregnancy and the risk of PUPPP seems to be higher with multiple gestation pregnancies.\nIt is important to consider other pregnancy-specific pruritic eruptions (such as pemphigoid gestationis, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy) as well as common eruptions  删除换行1 unrelated to pregnancy (such as urticaria, drug eruptions, viral exanthems, scabies). A  删除换行5 comprehensive examination for evidence of scabies is indicated as well as investigations  删除换行1 to rule out pemphigoid gestationis (skin biopsy for direct immunofluoresence studies).\n\n【12】Although PUPPP can be very symptomatic and consequently distressing for the affected  删除换行1 mother, the eruption itself is not thought to have any adverse effects on the fetus.\nManagement is therefore based on symptomatic relief with cool baths, light clothing,  删除换行1 emollients and topical corticosteroids, as well as reassurance.\n\n【13】 KEY POINTS\n\n【14】• Pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy (PUPPP) is a benign pregnancy  删除换行1 dermatosis which usually arises in the third trimester.\n\n【15】• The most distressing aspect of the eruption is the associated pruritus. It is otherwise  删除换行1 self-limited with no adverse effects on fetal outcome.\n\n【16】• The pathomechanism of the eruption is unknown but it is more commonly observed  删除换行1 in association with recent, sudden weight gain, male fetus and multiple gestational  删除换行1 pregnancies.",

The image depicts the epithelium that lies above the Peyer patches, found within the ileum. This epithelium superficial to Peyer patches has several microfold cells (known as M cells), specialized cells that function to endocytose and phagocytose particles in the lumen of the gut. Thus, they serve as immune surveillance in the intestines. In adults, B lymphocytes predominate in Peyer patches and secrete IgA, the main antibody present within the mucosal lining of the gut. IgA is synthesized by plasma cells that reside within the lamina propria. Of note is the fact that several gut pathogens express virulence factors, known as IgA proteases, which cleave and therefore deactivate the dimeric IgA antibodies. Mycobacterium avium infection is common in patients with AIDS. Eighty percent to 90% acquire the infection by oral ingestion and subsequent penetration of the bacteria through Peyer patches of the ileum.  \nAnswer B is incorrect . IgD is found only on the surface of B lymphocytes; its function is not known.  \nAnswer C is incorrect . IgE orchestrates the type I hypersensitivity response. Cross-linking of two IgE molecules on the surface of mast cells by antigen results in mast cell degranulation and allergic reaction.  \nAnswer D is incorrect . IgG is the main antibody produced during a secondary immune response and also the most abundant.  \nAnswer E is incorrect . While IgM can be found within the gut lumen, IgA predominates.",

What is the treatment regime suggested for this child?\n\n【13】Explanations\n\n【14】A.1. This child is suffering with classical galactosemia which is due to deficiency of enzyme： 'Galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase' (GaliPUT). This enzyme is responsible for conversion of galactose-1-phosphate to glucose-1-phosphate. It is an autosomal recessive disorder. The pathway of galactose metabolism is illustrated in Fig.1.\n\n【15】A.2. Biochemical explanation of clinical signs and symptoms is as follows：\n\n【16】a. Hepatomegaly\\： Lack of this enzyme impairs galactose metabolism and results in 删除换行1 accumulation of galactose-1-phosphate in liver which results in hepatomegaly.\n\n【17】b.

Cataract is bilateral and most of the cases cataract is mild and transient and it is reversible provided dietary treatment with lactose- and galactose-free diet starts early within 20 davs of life.\n\n【21】A.3. Treatment of this child is lactose and galactose-free diet. This regime should be started within 10 days of life. Delay in starting the treatment results in organ damage and low IQ. Despite adequate treatment from an early age， children with classic galactosemia remain at increased risk for developmental delays， speech problems and motor dysfunction.\n\n【22】Childhood apraxia\\ of speech and dysarthria\\ require expert speech therapy.

She also complains about feeling increasingly anxious, “hot all the time,” and weight loss, but she attributes these symptoms to increased stress at work, where she was recently promoted to a project manager position. On physical examination, the physician finds fine hair growth on her face and extremities, with body mass index of 16.5 kg/m <sup class=\"calibre40\">2 </sup> . Which of the following autoantibodies is responsible for this woman’s condition?\n\n【1】> (A) Antimicrosomal antibodies\n\n【2】> (B) Thyrotropin receptor inhibitory antibodies\n\n【3】> (C) Thyrotropin receptor stimulatory antibodies\n\n【4】> (D) Thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor inhibitory antibodies\n\n【5】> (E) Thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor stimulatory antibodies\n\n【6】 Answer: The correct answer is C . Graves disease is caused by autoantibodies to the thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone) receptor. The autoantibodies activate the receptor, stimulating thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion and growth of the thyroid gland. Hence, Graves disease most commonly presents with the signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism, including heat intolerance, sweating, weight loss, tremor, anxiety, weakness, and diarrhea as well as exophthalmos and pretibial myxedema.  \nAnswer A is incorrect . Antimicrosomal antibodies are present in >90% of patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis and in 50%-80% patients with silent thyroiditis.  \nAnswer B is incorrect . Thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone) receptor inhibitory autoantibodies lead to Hashimoto thyroiditis and thus signs and symptoms consistent with hypothyroidism.  \nAnswer D is incorrect . Graves disease does not involve thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor inhibitory antibodies, but rather is a result of stimulatory autoantibodies to the thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone) receptor.  \nAnswer E is incorrect . Graves disease does not involve thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor stimulatory antibodies, but rather is a result of stimulatory autoantibodies to the thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone) receptor.",

        "text": "【0】CASE 92: STIFFNESS OF THE SKIN DEVELOPING AFTER BONE\n\n【1】MARROW TRANSPLANTATION\n\n【2】History\n\n【3】A 37-year-old man presents with a rash and diarrhoea to the haematology out-patient  删除换行1 team. Six months previously he had developed red patches on his skin, which then  删除换行1 became pale and gradually felt firm and tight. He describes stiffness of his elbow and  删除换行1 knee joints, such that he is having trouble straightening his limbs. One year previously  删除换行1 he had undergone a matched, unrelated, allogenic bone marrow transplant for acute myeloid leukaemia. He is taking multiple medications including aciclovir, co-trimoxazole,  删除换行1 penicillin V, itraconazole and omeprazole.\n\n【4】Examination\n\n【5】He has extensive skin changes over his trunk and limbs with erythematous patches with  删除换行1 hypopigmented centres 删除33：<u></u>. There is mottled hyperpigmentation and generalized  删除换行1 thickening of the skin, which appears waxy and feels tight. Also, fixed flexion deformities  删除换行1 are present over his elbows and knees.\n\n【6】删除3：<u>Figure 92.1</u>\n\n【7】Questions\n\n【8】• What is the diagnosis?\n\n【9】• What other systems can be involved?\n\n【10】• How would you manage this patient?\nANSWER 92\n\n【11】This patient was diagnosed with chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Skin changes  删除换行1 characterized by thickening and tightening after bone marrow transplantation are  删除换行1 referred to as sclerodermoid GVHD.\n\n【12】GVHD is an immune disorder that commonly follows bone marrow transplantation. It  删除换行1 is less common after solid organ transplantation and, rarely, has also been reported in  删除换行1 patients after blood transfusion and by maternal–fetal transfusion. GVHD results from a  删除换行1 reaction of incompatible, immunocompetent donor cells against the tissue of an immunocompetent host. Acute and chronic disease are described both of which increase the  删除换行1 patient’s susceptibility to infection.\n\n【13】Chronic GVHD is said to occur more than 100 days after transplantation. Patients may  删除换行1 have had acute GVHD (usually between 14 and 21 days post-transplantation) or it arises  删除换行1 de novo. Cutaneous disease has different morphological types. These include lichenoid,  删除换行1 sclerodermoid and eczematous types. Lichenoid disease is characterized by flat-topped  删除换行1 violaceous ‘lichen–planus’-like papules and plaques, which manifest initially on the  删除换行1 extremities but can become generalized. Mucosal disease is also seen. Sclerodermoid disease occurs predominantly over the trunk and upper lower limbs and the skin is described  删除换行1 as ‘hardening’ or ‘tight’. This disease can also become generalized leading to joint contractures. Hair loss is also a common feature, which is usually permanent.\n\n【14】GVHD may also affect the eyes, mouth, joints, gastrointestional tract (diarrhoea), liver  删除换行1 (transaminitis) and respiratory system.\n\n【15】Prevention of GVHD is the mainstay of treatment. Chronic GVHD carries a high morbidity and mortality. It is commonly associated with recurrent and occasionally fatal bacterial infections, which are the main cause of death in patients with GVHD. Patients are  删除换行1 immunosuppressed with a variety of medication including ciclosporin, mycophenolate  删除换行1 and tacrolimus with or without prednisone.\nManaging skin GVHD is dependent on the extent and affected site. For limited disease  删除换行1 topical therapy with potent corticosteroids can be of benefit. For more extensive disease the aim is to treat GVHD before life-threatening sepsis occurs. High-dose systemic  删除换行1 corticosteroids are usually added to the immunosuppressant regime. Phototherapy with  删除换行1 psoralen–UVA and high-dose long-wave ultraviolet (UV) radiation (UVA1) may reduce  删除换行1 the severity of the cutaneous skin problems. In addition, to reduce the amount of immunosuppression required, extracorporeal photophoresis can be effective.\n\n【16】 KEY POINTS\n\n【17】• Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is an immune disorder that may occur after bone  删除换行1 marrow transplantation.\n\n【18】• Acute and chronic forms of GVDH have been described.\n\n【19】• Different types of cutaneous GVHD include lichenoid, sclerodermoid and eczematous.",

CT of the abdomen/pelvis\n\n【16】E.Open reduction and internal fixation of the pelvis\n\n【17】ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS\n\n【18】28.1 B. Although there are insufficient data to make Level I recommendations， patient B does fulfill the criteria of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons for possible intracranial pressure monitoring. These criteria are： CT confirmed intracranial hemorrhage， GCS of 8 or less， and receiving sedation.\n\n【19】28.2 C. This scenario describes a patient who was involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision and is hemodynamically unstable. Her FAST examination is positive suggesting intraabdominal hemorrhage. She requires exploratory laparotomy. Bleeding takes priority in this instance， since without control of hemorrhage she is likely to die； she is already hemodynamically unstable， suggesting that she is in Class IV shock. Angiography and embolization are options for relatively stable patients with solid organ injuries， and reasoning behind embolization is that early embolization can help avoid surgical inter-ventions in some of the patients. If this patient stabilizes with resuscitation and a CT demonstrates such injuries， then angiography and embolization can be viable options.\n\n【20】28.3 A. This patient has a pelvic fracture with a pattern known to result in bleed-ing. Additionally， he is hemodynamically unstable. A normalFAST examina tion has ruled out intra-abdominal hemorrhage. It must be assumed that his hemodynamic instability is secondary to bleeding from his pelvic fracture. The first step is to place a pelvic binder to reduce the potential pelvic space where bleeding can occur. If his hemodynamic status improves， he would not need angiography. If he continues to deteriorate despite placement of the binder and transfusion， he would require angiography and possible embolization of branches of the internal iliac artery which may be bleeding.\n\n【21】CLINICAL PEARLS\n\n【22】Patients who have suffered blunt polytrauma can have multiple poten-tially lethal injuries. It is the physician's responsibility to triage the patient's injuries.\n\n【23】The great majority of mild head injuries (GCS 13-15) can be monitored and do not require intervention.\n\n【24】A positive FAST examination in a hypotensive patient mandates exploration.\n\n【25】Several radiographic findings can help predict success of nonoperative management of spleen injuries.\n\n【26】Liver injury management (operative vs nonoperative) is dictated by the patient's clinical status.",

She states that they began to develop as blisters initially, but would burst within a day and leave behind a scaly rash that is mildly painful and pruritic. She denies any recent illness or changes to her personal care products. On examination, there are scattered erythematous and hyperpigmented macules and papules with overlying scale and secondary excoriations on the upper chest and back 通用删除7(英):<u>( 12 )</u>. There is no involvement of the oral or genital mucosa.\n\n【4】i. What is the most likely diagnosis? What molecule is most likely to be targeted in the pathology of this disease?\n\n【5】ii. What are the characteristic features on histology and immunofluorescence studies? What substrate should be used for indirect immunofluorescence studies?\n\n【6】iii. What is the first-line treatment of choice?\n\n【7】Answer 12\n\n【8】i. The patient’s history and the clinical presentation are most consistent with pemphigus foliaceus, a form of pemphigus. In most populations, pemphigus vulgaris is more common than pemphigus foliaceus, except among the populations of Finland, Tunisia and Brazil. Unlike pemphigus vulgaris, pemphigus foliaceus rarely involves the oral mucosa. It is caused by the development of IgG autoantibodies against desmoglein-1 (DSG1), a protein found in desmosomes in the keratinocytes of the skin.\n\n【9】Clinically, patients develop scattered scaly, crusted erosions often distributed on the scalp, face and upper trunk. The primary lesions are vesicles and bullae but are typically so superficial and fragile that the resultant crust and scale are the main findings on examination.\n\n【10】ii. On histopathologic examination, blisters in pemphigus foliaceus demonstrate acantholysis in the upper epidermis, often similar in appearance to that seen in staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome or bullous impetigo. On direct immunofluorescence studies, IgG deposition can be seen on the keratinocyte cell surfaces. Indirect immunofluorescence performed on a guinea pig esophagus can be used to detect anti-DSG1 autoantibodies.\n\n【11】iii. In localized disease, pemphigus foliaceus can be managed with potent topical corticosteroids. For more widespread and active disease, systemic medications such as those used for pemphigus vulgaris are used, including prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil and other immunosuppressants.",

She says that he is a regular heroin user.\nShe found him with a needle and syringe in his hand but is unsure what he had injected  删除换行1 himself with. He has no medical or surgical history.\n\n【3】Examination\n\n【4】This young man is drowsy but rousable. His pupils are very small. His respiratory rate is  删除换行1 6/min but his lungs sound clear. He has needle track marks up his arm, as well as a fresh  删除换行1 puncture mark in the left antecubital fossa.\n\n【5】Questions\n\n【6】• How can this patient’s consciousness level be assessed?\n\n【7】• What is the likely cause of the reduced consciousness?\n\n【8】• How would you manage this patient?\nANSWER 81\n\n【9】There are two main scoring systems used for assessing a patient’s consciousness level: \n\n【10】the AVPU and the GCS.\n\n【11】The AVPU score is based on noting whether the patient is:\n\n【12】A Alert spontaneously;\n\n【13】V alert to Voice;\n\n【14】P alert to Pain;\n\n【15】U Unresponsive.\n\n【16】Although the system is not very detailed, it does allow you to very rapidly note how  删除换行1 responsive a patient is and often prompts you to take action and call for help if the  删除换行1 patient is scoring a V or less.\n\n【17】The second commonly used scoring system is the Glasgow Coma Scale 删除25：<u></u>.\nPatients score points for their verbal response, whether their eyes are open, and the movements that they make. The GCS is an objective score that allows a patient’s neurological  删除换行1 function to be accurately assessed and monitored.\n\n【18】Table 81.1 Scoring on the Glasgow Coma Scale\n\n【19】GCS score Best  删除换行1 eye response (E)\n\n【20】Best  删除换行1 verbal response (V)\n\n【21】Best  删除换行1 motor response (M) 删除换行1 1 Does not open eyes Makes no sounds Makes no movements 删除换行1 2 Eyes open to pain Incomprehensible  删除换行1 sounds\n\n【22】Extension to painful stimuli  删除换行1 (decerebrate response)\n3 Eyes open to voice Inappropriate words Abnormal flexion to  删除换行1 painful stimuli (decorticate  删除换行1 response) 删除换行1 4 Eyes open  删除换行1 spontaneously 删除换行5 Confused Flexes/withdraws from  删除换行1 painful stimuli 删除换行1 5 – Orientated, normal  删除换行1 conversation\n\n【23】Localizes painful stimuli 删除换行1 6 – – Moves obeying commands\n\n【24】The patient has a history of substance misuse, and from the examination it can be concluded that he has injected himself with something, probably heroin. Like morphine,  删除换行1 heroin is an opiate drug and features of opiate toxicity are manifold.\n\n【25】• Respiratory system. There is a slow respiratory rate with shallow breathing. This can  删除换行1 progress to respiratory arrest.\n\n【26】• Abdominal system. Vomiting is common and, if the patient has a reduced consciousness level, there is a risk of aspirating (inhaling) the vomit. Later, once the patient has  删除换行1 recovered, he/she is likely to be constipated, as the opiate drug will slow intestinal  删除换行1 motility.\n\n【27】• Neurological system. Patients show a reduced consciousness level and may be unable  删除换行1 to protect the airway. They may present anywhere on a spectrum from alert and orientated, to confused and drowsy, to comatose. A classic sign of opiate toxicity is small  删除换行1 pupils, which are often described as ‘pin-point’.\n\n【28】The first thing to do is assess the patient according to the ABCD protocol. Then a scoring  删除换行1 system should be applied. For example, a GCS score of 8 or less means that the patient 217 删除换行1 is probably not able to safely protect his/her own airway, so simple airway management  删除换行1 techniques should be carried out until a senior doctor or member of the anaesthetics team  删除换行1 can assess for more definitive airway management.\n\n【29】Naloxone is an opiate antagonist and can be used to reverse the effects of morphine and  删除换行1 heroin. Naloxone acts within seconds and patients will often dramatically regain consciousness, but the drug effect lasts only for a few minutes. An infusion of naloxone may  删除换行1 need to be given; ideally this would be done in a high-dependency setting.\n\n【30】KEY POINTS\n\n【31】• In any patient with a reduced consciousness level, a neurological scoring system  删除换行1 should be applied. This allows monitoring of improvement or deterioration in  删除换行1 consciousness.\n\n【32】• Signs of opiate overdose include reduced consciousness level, pin-point pupils,  删除换行1 reduced respiratory rate and vomiting.\n\n【33】• With a suspected opiate overdose, help from senior doctors should be sought as the  删除换行1 patient may need to be managed in a high-dependency setting.删除6：<u>This page intentionally left blank 219</u>",

Rare physical causes like short-loop Hirschsprung  删除换行1 disease, if considered, would require referral to a paediatrician. This would be sensible if constipation is ongoing. The smearing is not likely to be organic, but physical and psychological  删除换行1 causes can coexist. In many respects the behaviour represents maladaptive coping strategies.\n\n【12】Encopresis (involuntary soiling) is more likely to occur in boys than girls. It tends to improve  删除换行1 with age and is relatively uncommon after age 16. Most children with encopresis have learnt  删除换行1 to control their bowels, but for various reasons lose this ability and develop secondary  删除换行1 encopresis.\n\n【13】Management will usually begin with treatment of any constipation and reinstatement of an  删除换行1 effective training strategy with support for the carers. Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) 删除换行1 and contingency strategies are useful. However, any underlying psychiatric disorder will  删除换行1 need to be treated or managed (such as counselling for past abuse) although this can be more  删除换行1 difficult the older the child is. It is also important to be aware that encopresis may lead to  删除换行1 scapegoating, anxiety and low self-esteem. Addressing these will also need to be part of the  删除换行1 overall management strategy. The initial treatment can begin immediately and supporting  删除换行1 treatments can be undertaken simultaneously. Child protection issues need to be reviewed,  删除换行1 particularly as these behaviours may represent a ‘flag’ for emotional or family disturbance  删除换行1 that needs to be addressed.\n\n【14】Key Points\n\n【15】• Faecal smearing should alert professionals that there may be child protection  删除换行1 issues to consider.\n\n【16】• Treatment of the constipation will not be sufficient.\n\n【17】Medical causes for faecal soiling\n\n【18】These include functional constipation and faecal retention, anorectal lesions that make  删除换行1 defecation painful, neurological causes, bowel disease, endocrine or metabolic causes.\n\n【19】删除测试2：<u>Case 86: She won’t say anything at school\n\n【20】</u>",

        "text": "【0】Question: 45.1 A 55-year-old man with congestive heart failure develops bilateral pleural effusions. Which of the following is the most likely pleural fluid characteristic if thoracentesis is performed?\n\n【1】A. Pleural fluid LDH 39, LDH ratio 0.2, protein ratio 0.7\n\n【2】B. Pleural fluid LDH 39, LDH ratio 0.2, protein ratio 0.1\n\n【3】C. Pleural fluid LDH 599, LDH ratio 0.9, protein ratio 0.1\n\n【4】D. Pleural fluid LDH 599, LDH ratio 0.9, protein ratio 0.7\n\n【5】Answer: 45.1 B. Congestive heart failure is commonly associated with bilateral pleural effusions, which are transudative, as a consequence of alteration of Starling forces. The effusions of heart failure are best managed by treating the heart failure, for example, with diuretics, and typically do not require thoracentesis.\n\n【6】Question: 45.2 A 39-year-old man develops a moderate free-flowing pleural effusion following a left lower lobe pneumonia. Thoracentesis reveals straw-colored fluid with gram-positive diplococci on Gram stain, pH 6.9, glucose 32 mg/dL, and LDH 1890. Which of the following is the best next step?\n\n【7】A. Send the fluid for culture.\n\n【8】B. Continue treatment with antibiotics for pneumococcal infection.\n\n【9】C. Tube thoracostomy to drain the effusion.\n\n【10】D. Schedule a follow-up chest x-ray in 2 weeks to document resolution of the effusion.\n\n【11】Answer: 45.2 C. The positive Gram stain, low pH, low glucose, and markedly elevated LDH all suggest that this parapneumonic effusion is “complicated,” that is, it is unlikely to resolve with antibiotic therapy and is likely to produce loculated pockets of pus, which will require surgical intervention. Drainage by serial thoracentesis or tube thoracostomy is essential.\n\n【12】Question: 45.3 A 69-year-old man complains of gradually worsening dyspnea and a nagging cough over the past 3 months but no fevers. He is found to have a right-sided pleural effusion, which is tapped and is grossly bloody. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【13】A. Parapneumonic effusion\n\n【14】B. Malignancy in the pleural space\n\n【15】C. Rupture of aortic dissection into the pleural space\n\n【16】D. Pulmonary embolism with pulmonary infarction\nAnswer: 45.3 B. The most common causes of hemorrhagic pleural effusion are malignancy, pulmonary embolism, and tuberculosis. Pulmonary embolism would be suggested by acute onset of dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain rather than this subacute presentation. Similarly, aortic rupture can produce a hemothorax but would have an acute presentation with pain and hemodynamic compromise.\n\n【17】CLINICAL PEARLS\n\n【18】 Transudative effusions meet none of the following criteria (exudative effusions meet at least one): (a) Pleural fluid protein/serum protein ratio more than 0.5. (b) Pleural fluid LDH/serum LDH ratio more than 0.6. (c) Pleural fluid LDH greater than two-thirds normal serum LDH.\n\n【19】 Tube thoracostomy or more aggressive drainage of parapneumonic effusion usually is required with gross pus (empyema), positive Gram stain or culture, glucose less than 60 mg/dL, pH less than 7.10, and loculations.\n\n【20】 The most common cause of pleural effusion is congestive heart failure, which typically gives bilateral symmetric transudative effusions and is best treated with diuresis.\n\n【21】 The most common causes of bloody pleural effusion (in the absence of trauma) are malignancy, pulmonary embolism with infarction, and tuberculosis.\n\n【22】#",

        "text": "【0】Case 9\nA 26-year-old waiter was serving food at a social function when he tripped and fell down a flight of stairs. He did not lose consciousness following the event but complains of severe neck pain and right wrist and hand pain. He was placed in a C-collar and transported by EMS to the emergency department (ED) with appro-priate C-spine precautions. His vital signs and cardiopulmonary examinations are within normal limits， Glasgow coma scale (GCS) is 15， and he is able to move all extremities. Palpation of his neck reveals tenderness at the midline， and his right distal forearm/wrist/hand is swollen and exquisitely tender to touch.\n\n【1】What are the appropriate steps in the evaluation of his neck pain?\n\n【2】What are the important elements in the evaluation of his right upper extremity?\n\n【3】ANSWERS TO CASE 9：Extremity Fracture and Neck Pain\n\n【4】Summary： A young man tripped and fell down some stairs and now complains of neck and right upper extremity pain. His history and presentation are concerning for cervical spine and right upper extremity injuries.\n\n【5】● Evaluation of neck pain： Obtain computed tomography (CT) of the cervical spine. If the CT does not demonstrate any bony fractures or dislocation and his midline tenderness persists， then obtain flexion/extension x-rays or MRI of the C-spine to help differentiate ligamentous injury/spinal instability from soft tis-sue contusion.\n\n【6】· Evaluations of upper extremity： Given the soft tissue swelling and the location of pain， physical examination of the affect extremity should include detailed evaluation of the hand， wrist， and forearm， and this should include clinical assessments of tissue perfusion and functionality. Although， vascular injuries are uncommon with this patient's injury mechanism， arterial inflow need to be evaluated based on capillary refill and presence or absence of pulses. If the perfusion status is in doubt， Doppler evaluation of pulse quality and pressures should be obtained. X-rays of the humerus， radius， ulna， wrist， and hand should be obtained to assess for possible bone injuries.\n\n【7】ANALYSIS\n\n【8】Objectives\n\n【9】1\\. Learn the common cervical spine injuries associated with the various injury mechanisms.\n\n【10】2\\. Learn the decision rules that guide the use of cervical spine radiography in trauma patients.\n\n【11】3\\. Learn the current role of corticosteroids in patients with spinal cord injuries.\n\n【12】4\\. Learn the emergency department management of elbow， forearm， wrist， andhand injuries.\n\n【13】Considerations\n\n【14】The neck pain associated with midline tenderness on palpation in this patient raises the concern for C-spine injury； therefore， radiographic evaluations must be obtained for further assessment. Either three views of the C-spine (AP， lateral， and odontoid views) or CT can be performed. CT is preferable over three views as the preferred diagnostic study in many centers because it is associated with much lower rates of false-negative examinations than plain radiography. CT would be especially help-ful in this patient who exhibits concerning symptoms and physical findings. If the neck pain and midline C-spine tenderness persist despite negative CT， additional 删除换行1 imaging to determine C-spine stability or to identify ligamentous injuries should be obtained. C-spine precautions should be maintained until the possibility of unstable injury can be eliminated based on imaging. Only when imaging studies indicate the absence of flexion/extension instability or the absence of ligamentous injuries can the patient be assumed to have neck pain related to soft tissue injuries only.\n\n【15】This patient also exhibit findings in the right distal forearm/wrist/hand that sug-gest the possibility of bony injuries. The initial evaluation should be directed toward evaluations of hand and digits functions； namely， motor/sensory functions and liga-mentous integrity. Careful palpation of the hand， wrist， and forearm should also be performed to localize areas of concern for bony injuries. Two-view radiographs should be obtained to assess the bony integrity of the humerus， radius， ulna， carpal bones， and phalanges. When identified， fractures and dislocations should be reduced to minimize neurovascular compromises. Further assessments and management of all bony， ligamentous injuries and functional abnormalities should be discussed with an orthopedic or hand specialist.\n\n【16】APPROACH TO：\n\n【17】DEFINITIONS\n\n【18】NEXUS LOW-RISK CRITERIA： This C-spine clearance approach was derived 删除换行1 based on a 1998 publication by Hoffman et al 删除10：<u>(Ann Emerg Med 1998；32：461-469)</u>. The recommendations are that C-spine radiography is indicated for asymptomatic trauma patients unless they meet all of the following criteria： 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> No posterior mid-line cervical tenderness. 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> No evidence intoxication. 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> Normal level of alert-ness. 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> No focal neurologic deficits. 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> No painful distracting injuries. The major limitation of this approach is that no precise definition for painful distracting inju-ries was provided.\n\n【19】THE CANADIAN C-SPINE RULE (CCR)： This is a guideline to determine the need for radiographic evaluations of alert and stable trauma patients. In comparison to the NEXUS criteria， the CCR has been shown to have slightly greater sensitivity and specificity for identification of patients who do not have C-spine injuries. 删除33：<u></u>\n\n【20】PARTIAL CORD SYNDROMES： Compression or contusions to the spinal cord can develop with or without concomitant bony injuries. Compression of the ante-rior cord can produce complete motor paralysis， loss of pain and temperature percep-tions. Posterior cord syndrome (Brown-Sequard) causes paralysis loss of vibratory sensation and proprioception ipsilaterally and loss of pain and temperature sensa-tions contralaterally. Central cord syndrome is produced by injuries to the cortico-spinal tract， which produces great upper extremities weakness in comparison to the lower extremities.\n\n【21】删除3：<u>Figure 9-1. Sample algorithm for assessing neck injury.</u>\n\n【22】CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【23】Millions of adults at risk for cervical spine injuries and/or upper extremity orthope-dic injuries are evaluated in emergency departments throughout the United States and Canada every year. Among patients presenting with intact neurological sta-tus to the emergency department， the incidence of acute C-spine fracture or spinal injury is less than 1%. Even though spinal injury incidences are low， there are great consequences associated with mismanagement. Similarly， mismanagement of upper extremity injuries can lead to potential employment and functional compromises.\n\n【24】Clearing the C-spine in the Blunt Trauma Patient\nThe goal of C-spine clearance is to establish that injuries are not present， and based on statistics， probabilities for injuries are low. The approach to patients is based on patient classifications， where individuals are classified as asymptomatic， tem-porarily non-assessable， symptomatic， and obtunded. Asymptomatic patients can be approached using the CCR， which has been shown to lead to the reduction in unnecessary radiography and has been demonstrated to be superior in comparison to the NEXUS criteria. For temporarily non-assessable patients (either due to intoxi-cation or distracting injuries)， the approach is to assess the patient as an obtunded patient or reassess the individual after treatments of distracted injuries or return of normal mentation. Symptomatic patients are recognized by the presence of neck pain， midline tenderness， or neurologic signs and symptoms； symptomatic patients need to be initially evaluated with either 3-view C-spine x-rays or preferably CT； symptomatic patients with negative CT who are suspected of having ligamentous injuries need to be further evaluated with MRI of the C-spine， and if both CT and 删除换行5 MRI are negative， then the patients can be discharged with a collar for comfort； however， if the patient has persistent neck pain after 2 weeks， flexion/extension films are recommended to assess C-spine stability. All symptomatic patients should be evaluated by a spine specialist prior to discharge from the ED. For obtunded trauma patients (altered mental status or prolonged intubation or psychiatric dis-turbances or uncooperative)， the initial evaluation is CT of the C-spine. If this is negative， there are two options； one option is to clear the C-spine， and the second option is to perform MRI to rule out ligamentous injuries. The major argument for option one is that isolated ligamentous injuries are rare， and the major argument for option two is that the negative predictive value of CT for ligamentous injuries is only 78%. It should be pointed out that the American College of Radiology recom-mends that CT and MRI are the most appropriate modalities for C-spine evaluation in the obtunded trauma patient. All obtunded trauma patients should be evaluated by trauma and/or spine specialists.\n\n【25】Emergency Department Management of C-spine Injuries\n\n【26】The initial management of any patient with C-spine injuries is to prioritize the ABCs， as most C-spine injuries do not occur as isolated injuries. Early definitive airways may be required for some patients who develop soft tissue swelling of the neck that lead to airway compromise. Similarly， definitive airway and mechanical ventilation may be required in patients with paralysis or muscle weakness associ-ated with C-spine injuries. Definitive airway management in these patients is best accomplished by in-line C-spine stabilization and orotracheal intubations， following rapid-sequence induction. It is important to bear in mind that most of the respi-ratory accessory muscles receive their motor innervations from the thoracic level， and the diaphragm receives its innervations from C3-C5； therefore， patients with compromised ventilation secondary to C-spine injuries generally do not exhibit any external signs of respiratory distress， and the most reliable way to detect hypoven-tilation is by Paco， measurements on arterial blood gas. Estimation of neurologic deficits can be determined based on physical examinations and radiographic evidence of fracture and/or dislocation. From C1 to C7， nerve root exit above the level of the vertebrae， and from C8 and below， the nerve roots exit below the vertebrae.\n\n【27】If possible， it is always preferable to be able to perform a thorough motor-sensory examination prior to intubation. For patients with spinal cord injuries， it is always preferable to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 85 to 90 mm Hg to maximize spi-nal cord perfusion. If needed， patients with isolated spinal cord injuries may benefit from initiation of vassopressors such as dopamines or norepinephrine. Bradycardia associated with neurogenic shock can be addressed with atropine.\n\n【28】The priorities for any spinal cord injury patients are to address the life-threatening injuries first followed by management of the limb and quality-of-life threatening injuries.\n\n【29】Role of Corticosteroids for Spinal Cord Injuries\n\n【30】Corticosteroids had been a mainstay of therapy in the early management of spinal cord injury patients； however， more recent publications suggest that high-dose corti-costeroids administration had only some benefits for individuals when the treatment 删除换行1 was initiated within 3 hours of the injury. Unfortunately， the treatments with high-dose corticosteroids are associated with increased rates of sepsis and other steroid-associated medical complications. In light of these published data， the application of corticosteroids for spinal cord injured patients have been dramatically reduced， and steroids should not be initiated for patients in the emergency department prior to discussions with the trauma and/or spine specialists who will ultimately manage the patient after ED discharge.\n\n【31】Management of Upper Extremity Injuries\n\n【32】Upper extremity injuries are commonly encountered in the ED. Inappropriate diag-nosis and management in the ED can lead to chronic pain， and threat to recreational and vocational activities. Orthopedic injuries to the upper extremities are catego-rized by the bone， location (proximal， midshaft， or distal)， presence or absence of joint involvement， degree of angulation， extent of comminution， and whether the fracture is open or closed.\n\n【33】Forearm fractures： Rotation of the forearm is crucial for hand function and activi-ties of daily living. Normally， the radius rotate around the fixed ulna， and the ability of these bones to rotate around each other depends on the shape of the bones and their positions in relationship to each other. Initial evaluations of patients require careful determination of neurovascular status of the extremity followed by x-rays. Injuries that involve only one of the two bones are generally stable and are treated by closed manipulation， cast immobilization under conscious sedation or ultra-sound-guided regional nerve blocks. Most displaced， fractures that involve both the ulna and radius are considered unstable fractures and are less amendable to closed fixations； therefore， many of these fractures are managed by open-reduction and internal fixations.\n\n【34】Distal radius fractures： This is one of the most common fractures encountered in children and adults. The bimodal distribution of this injury demonstrates a peak in late childhood (predominantly males) and after the sixth decade of life (pre-dominantly females). The most common mechanism associated with this injury is a ground-level fall with outstretched hand. The Colles-Pouteau fracture is a fracture of the distal radial metaphysic with dorsal displacement of the distal fragment， and this represents the most commonly encountered distal radial fracture. In children， distal radius fractures are grouped as metaphyseal and physeal fractures， with the physeal fractures demonstrating involvement of the growth plate and can be further classified by the Salter-Harris classifications. Most of distal radius fractures in chil-dren are treated by closed reduction and cast fixation. The goals of a management in adults are to restore bone alignment and avoid shortening of the radius. The deci-sion to treat patients by closed reduction and fixation versus operative reduction and fixation are determined by the degree of alignment， age， and functional status of the patients. Common complications associated with these injuries are malunion， nerve injury， tendon injury， stiffness， and chronic pain.\n\n【35】Carpal bone fractures： There are eight carpal bones in the hand. Carpal bones in general have limited blood supply and are susceptible to avascular necrosis following injuries. Often， details of fractures and/or dislocations of the carpal bones are difficult to 删除换行1 visualize by plain radiography， therefore CTs or MRIs are sometimes used to deter-mine the location and extent of injuries. Most displaced fractures are managed by operative reduction and fixation. Some of the stable， non-displaced carpal fractures can be initially approach with cast fixation. The management of any carpal injuries should be discussed with an orthopedic or hand specialist.\n\n【36】Metacarpal and phalangeal fractures： These fractures can be sometimes over-looked especially in a patient with multisystem injuries. The failure to identify and treat these injuries could lead to potential finger misalignement， pain， and functional loss. The goals of management of metacarpal fractures are to preserve bone length， rotational functions， and articular functions， which can be accomplished by either immobilization or internal fixation. The goals of managing phalangeal fractures are to minimize angulation and rotational deformities. Functional recoveries in most cases require patients'participation in rehabilitation programs. Early involvement of a hand or orthopedic specialist is vital in the management of these patients.",

        "text": "【0】Case Files® Biochemistry, Third Edition    \n\n【1】CASE 32\n-------\n\n【2】A 63-year-old woman presents to the clinic with recurrent midepigastric pain during the last 3 months. She reports some relief shortly after eating, but then the discomfort returns. She has tried various over-the-counter medications without relief. She also reports feeling tired and has had to increase the amount of ibuprofen needed for relief of her arthritis. She denies nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. On examination she is found to have mild midepigastric tenderness and guaiac positive stool. A complete blood count revealed a microcytic anemia and normal white blood cell count, consistent with iron deficiency. The patient was referred to a gastroenterologist who performed an upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy that identified gastric ulcers. He stated that he suspected that the ibuprofen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) was the causative agent and suggested switching from ibuprofen to a coxib, such as celecoxib.\n\n【3】 What is the likely biochemical etiology of the disorder?\n\n【4】 Why do coxibs generally have a lower incidence of upper GI problems than other NSAIDs?\n\n【5】 What is the major difference between aspirin and other NSAIDs with regard to platelet function?\n\n【6】### ANSWERS TO CASE 32:\n\n【7】#### NSAID-Associated Gastritis\n\n【8】Summary: A 63-year-old woman with arthritis taking an NSAID with recent onset of epigastric pain relieved with food, guaiac positive stools, and iron deficiency anemia. Endoscopic examination reveals gastric ulcers.\n\n【9】• Biochemical etiology: Primarily, NSAID inhibition of a gastric enzyme (cyclooxygenase \\[COX\\]-1) required for synthesis of prostaglandins that have a protective effect on the gastric mucosa. A contributory factor is direct mucosal damage due to the acidic chemistry of NSAIDs.\n\n【10】• Decreased gastric side effects with coxibs: Traditional NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and aspirin, inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2. The coxibs are selective inhibitors of COX-2, allowing continued production of protective prostaglandins by gastric COX-1.\n\n【11】• Difference between aspirin and other NSAIDs: Aspirin covalently modifies platelet COX-1, thus irreversibly blocking thromboxane formation and reducing platelet function for the lifespan of the affected platelet (platelets cannot synthesize new proteins). The inhibitory action of other NSAIDs on platelet COX-1 is not covalent and is eventually reversed when the agents’ blood levels decline.\n\n【12】### CLINICAL CORRELATION\n\n【13】NSAIDs, also known as prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors or COX inhibitors, can induce upper GI irritation or ulcers. The NSAIDs include a wide variety of medications including aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, and indomethacin. These medications are used for pain, inflammation, dysmenorrhea, headache, arthritis, or fever. These compounds act as anti-inflammatory and antipyretic agents by inhibiting COX catalysis by prostaglandin H synthase (PGHS). PGHS has 2 isoenzymes: PGHS-1 (or COX-1) is generally a basal enzyme found in various tissues including platelets and gastric mucosa, while PGHS-2 (or COX-2) is an inducible enzyme typically expressed in response to cytokines and mitogens at sites of inflammation or cell proliferation.\n\n【14】Older NSAIDs, such as aspirin and ibuprofen, inhibit both COX-1 and -2, but a newer class of NSAIDs, called coxibs, is selective for COX-2 inhibition. By sparing production of cytoprotective prostaglandins by mucosal COX-1, coxibs have fewer problems with irritation and ulceration in the upper GI tract.\n\n【15】Thromboxane produced by platelet COX-1 in concert with a downstream enzyme is prothrombotic, so aspirin and other NSAIDs cause platelet dysfunction and increase bleeding time. Aspirin is unusual in that it causes covalent, irreversible inhibition of the COX protein, whereas other NSAIDs have noncovalent, reversible actions. Thus, because they cannot synthesize more COX protein, platelets are irreversibly affected by aspirin but only temporarily affected by other NSAIDs. Low-dose aspirin is often used in antithrombotic prophylaxis.\n\n【16】The prothrombotic and vasoconstrictive actions of COX-1-derived thromboxane in the vasculature are opposed by an antithrombotic and vasodilative prostaglandin, prostacyclin, that originates from COX-2 in vascular endothelial cells. Thus, the COX-2 selective coxibs tend to decrease prostacyclin levels in the vasculature without reducing the thromboxane levels. This tendency is thought to explain the small but significant increase in cardiovascular risk that led to withdrawal of 2 coxibs from the US market.\n\n【17】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【18】#### Prostaglandin Metabolism\n\n【19】### OBJECTIVES\n\n【20】1\\. Describe the biosynthetic and cell signaling pathways involving prostanoids.\n\n【21】2\\. Distinguish between the pathophysiologic roles of the 2 PGHS isoforms.\n\n【22】3\\. Cite the pharmacologic targets of NSAIDs and the characteristics that distinguish coxibs and aspirin from other NSAIDs.\n\n【23】### DEFINITIONS\n\n【24】EICOSANOIDS: Oxygenated lipid-signaling molecules containing 20 carbons derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids released from membrane phospholipids by the action of phospholipase A <sub>2 </sub> . These include the prostanoids produced by the cyclooxygenase pathway and the leukotrienes produced by the lipoxygenase pathway.\n\n【25】PROSTANOIDS: Oxygenated lipid signaling molecules derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids released from membrane phospholipids by the action of phospholipase A <sub>2 </sub> . Prostanoids include prostaglandins, prostacyclin, and thromboxanes.\n\n【26】PROSTAGLANDIN: An oxygenated lipid-signaling molecule that has a 5-member ring system that is derived from arachidonic acid and other 20-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids. The prostaglandins are hormone-like molecules that regulate cellular events near the area in which they are synthesized.\n\n【27】THROMBOXANE: An oxygenated lipid-signaling molecule that has a 6-member ring system derived from arachidonic acid and other 20-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids. Thromboxanes are involved in platelet aggregation as well as vasoconstriction and bronchoconstriction and lymphocyte proliferation.\n\n【28】PGH SYNTHASE: Prostaglandin H synthase; the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of prostaglandin H from C <sub>20 </sub> polyunsaturated acids. PGH synthase has 2 activities; the cyclooxygenase activity introduces the 5-membered ring into the polyunsaturated fatty acid while also introducing an endoperoxide between carbons 9 and 10 and a hydroperoxide at carbon 15. The peroxidase activity reduces the hydroperoxide to a hydroxyl group using glutathione as the source of reducing equivalents. PGH synthase exists in 2 isoforms, PGHS-1 and PGHS-2. PGHS-1 is the “basal” isoform and is expressed constitutively, whereas PGHS-2 is the inducible isoform and has been implicated in cell proliferation and inflammation.\n\n【29】NSAID: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug; NSAIDs inhibit the COX activity of PGH synthase, thus inhibiting the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes.\n\n【30】COXIBS: A class of NSAIDs that is selective for inhibition of the cyclooxygenase activity of PGHS-2, with weaker action against the PGHS-1 cyclooxygenase.\n\n【31】### DISCUSSION\n\n【32】Prostanoids are oxygenated lipid-signaling molecules derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids . The major prostanoids synthesized from the prototypical polyunsaturated fatty acid, arachidonic acid, are prostaglandin (PG) D <sub>2 </sub> , PGE <sub>2 </sub> , PGF <sub>2a </sub> , PGH <sub>2 </sub> , PGI <sub>2 </sub> (also known as prostacyclin) , and thromboxane (TX) A <sub>2 </sub> . The prostanoid-signaling cascade begins with an external stimulus, most often the binding of a ligand to a cell surface receptor that activates one or more phospholipases A <sub>2 </sub> . The latter are enzymes that release arachidonic acid from its esterified form in membrane phospholipids such as phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylinositol. Arachidonate is converted to PGH <sub>2 </sub> by one of the isoforms of PGH synthase (PGHS-1 or -2), enzymes localized to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and the nuclear envelope.\n\n【33】In turn, PGH <sub>2 </sub> is metabolized to the prostanoid lipid signals (PGD <sub>2 </sub> , PGE <sub>2 </sub> , PGF <sub>2a </sub> , PGH <sub>2 </sub> , PGI <sub>2 </sub> , or TXA <sub>2 </sub> ) by one of the secondary enzymes named for the individual prostanoid produced 删除33：<u></u>. The type of prostanoid produced is determined by which downstream enzyme is present; usually one downstream enzyme predominates in a given cell. For example, the prominent secondary enzyme in platelets is thromboxane synthase , whereas vascular endothelial cells feature prostacyclin (PGI) synthase . Prostanoid signaling molecules usually exit the cell that produces them to act on G-protein coupled receptors on the surface of the same cell or cells nearby (termed autocrine or paracrine actions). Some prostanoids may be further metabolized to ligands for a subset of nuclear receptors, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). The active prostanoids are rapidly converted to inactive metabolites by enzymes present in a variety of cells. As a result, prostanoid signaling molecules have very short half-lives in the circulation and are not hormones in the conventional sense.\n\n【34】删除3：<u>Figure 32-1. Diagram illustrating cell-signaling pathways involving prostanoids.</u>\n\n【35】Conversion of arachidonate to PGH <sub>2 </sub> is a key regulatory step in prostanoid biosynthesis . Each PGHS isoform catalyzes 2 separate reactions 删除33：<u></u>. The first reaction ( arachidonate → PGG <sub>2 </sub> ) involves insertion of 2 molecules of oxygen and cyclization of the fatty acid backbone. This step is catalyzed by the COX activity of PGHS-1 or -2; it is these COX activities (also called COX-1 and COX-2) that are inhibited by NSAIDs. The second step (PGG <sub>2 </sub> →PGH <sub>2 </sub> ) involves the reduction of the hydroperoxide on C15 to an alcohol and is catalyzed by the peroxidase activity of PGHS-1 or -2 .\n\n【36】删除3：<u>Figure 32-2. Steps in conversion of arachidonic acid to PGH <sub>2 </sub> by PGH synthase. A cosubstrate, indicated by e <sup>- </sup> , is required to furnish 2 reducing equivalents for the peroxidase reaction.</u>\n\n【37】Although both PGHS isoforms have cyclooxygenase and peroxidase activities and are structurally similar proteins, they have very distinct pathophysiologic functions. Many cells, including platelets and gastric mucosal cells, have moderate levels of the “basal” isoform, PGHS-1. Functions attributed to PGHS-1 include regulating hemostasis and vascular tone, renal function, and maintaining gastric mucosal integrity. A smaller number of cells, such as macrophages, vascular endothelial cells, and fibroblasts, dramatically upregulate levels of the “inducible” isoform, PGHS-2, in response to cytokines or mitogens. PGHS-2 has been implicated in cell proliferation, inflammation, carcinogenesis, and parturition.\n\n【38】Many COX inhibitors have been developed and their structures are quite varied 删除33：<u></u>. All known inhibitors compete with fatty-acid substrate for binding to the cyclooxygenase site on the enzyme. Aspirin was one of the earliest NSAIDs discovered and is now widely used as an analgesic and antiinflammatory agent. More recently, aspirin has emerged as a very useful antithrombotic agent because of its action against platelet COX activity . Aspirin shows both archetypal modes of COX inhibition. The first mode involves rapid reversible binding of inhibitor (I) at the COX site of the enzyme (E) to form an EI complex; the second mode involves a slower conversion of EI to a higher affinity complex, EI′ (Equation 1).\n\n【39】删除3：<u>Figure 32-3. Structures of some cyclooxygenase inhibitors.</u>\n\n【40】EI and EI′ cannot bind fatty acid and thus neither can catalyze the cyclooxygenase reaction. For aspirin, conversion of EI to EI′ is accompanied by covalent modification of the protein, making the transition irreversible . Formation of the EI′ complex produces a more powerful COX inhibition because the inhibitor is not readily displaced by substrate and because inhibition persists even when free inhibitor is removed. Flurbiprofen and indomethacin form EI′ complexes with both PGHS-1 and -2, although they do not covalently modify either protein. Ibuprofen forms only EI complexes with both PGHS isoforms. The coxibs (such as celecoxib and rofecoxib) derive their exquisitely selective inhibition of PGHS-2 cyclooxygenase from their ability to form noncovalent EI′ complexes with PGHS-2 and not with PGHS-1. This selectivity has made coxibs useful for anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative therapy with reduced GI adverse events, but it also makes them ineffective as antiplatelet agents and, consequently, can increase cardiovascular risks.\n\n【41】###",

        "text": "【0】Question: A 25-year-old woman comes to her physician complaining of pain with intercourse and dysmenorrhea that worsens one-two days before her period starts. Ultrasonography reveals unilateral adnexal masses, and laparoscopy shows reddish-brown cysts on the ovaries. This patient is at increased risk for developing which of the following conditions?\n\n【1】> (A) Carcinoma\n\n【2】> (B) Infertility\n\n【3】> (C) Intracranial hemorrhage\n\n【4】> (D) Masculinization\n\n【5】> (E) Obesity\n\n【6】 Answer: The correct answer is B. A blood-filled cyst (a so-called chocolate cyst) is characteristic of endometriosis, a condition that results in non-neoplastic endometrial glands/stroma being abnormally located outside the endometrial cavity. The ovary and the pelvic peritoneum are the most common sites. The cysts are formed during cyclic bleeding from the tissue, mimicking menstruation. Severe menstrualrelated pain (dysmenorrhea), pain during sexual intercourse (dyspareunia), and infertility are possible complications of endometriosis.  \nAnswer A is incorrect. Common cancers in the reproductive tract include endometrial carcinoma, which can arise from endometrial hyperplasia caused by excess estrogen stimulation, and cervical carcinoma, associated with human papillomavirus infection. Endometriosis does not progress to cancer.  \nAnswer C is incorrect. Autosomal dominant (adult) polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is characterized by bilaterally enlarged kidneys with multiple cysts. Cysts can also involve the liver, pancreas, heart, and brain. This disease manifests as renal abnormalities that progresses to end stage renal disease. In patients with ADPKD there is usually a family history, bilateral involvement, and constant pain that does not wax and wane in conjunction with menstrual cycles. Another manifestation of ADPKD is the emergence of intracranial berry aneurysms that can rupture and produce intracranial hemorrhage. Endometriosis is not associated with ADPKD.  \nAnswer D is incorrect. Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS or Stein-Leventhal syndrome) has many causes. The main characteristics of PCOS are irregular or anovulation and hyperandrogenism. Features seen in PCOS include ovarian cysts, amenorrhea, infertility, obesity, and hirsutism caused by excess LH and androgens. In some women this is associated with insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, which increases androgen production in the ovarian theca cells and, secondarily, LH production. The insulin resistance also leads to hyperglycemia and suppresses hepatic steroid hormone binding globulin (SHBG) synthesis. The decrease in SHBG along with the increase in androgen production leads to a vicious cycle of amenorrhea and infertility. Endometriosis is not associated with masculinization and PCOS.  \nAnswer E is incorrect. Endometriosis is not associated with obesity.",

        "text": "【0】Question: 5.1 A 7-month-old baby boy is brought into the office for a possible ear infection. In assessing the infant’s posture, you note that he is not able to sit very well without support. You also observe other fine motor skills and speech. Which of the following is the most accurate statement?\n\n【1】A. By 3 months of age, a child should be able to sit up without support.\n\n【2】B. By 6 months of age, a child should be able to transfer objects from one hand to another.\n\n【3】C. By 9 months of age, a child should be able to walk.\n\n【4】D. By 12 months of age, a child should be able to put two words together.\n\n【5】Answer: 5.1 B . It is critical to understand the normal milestones for gross motor, fine motor, speech and social categories. Delay in one or more areas can indicate problems which if addressed can alleviate long-term issues. Most 6-month-old children would be expected to sit without support. Six-month-old children would also be expected to transfer objects from one hand to the other, roll from a prone to supine position, babble, and recognize strangers.\n\n【6】Question: 5.2 A 5-year-old presents to your clinic for a school physical. The child weighs 42 lb and is up-to-date on his immunizations. Which of the following anticipatory guidances is most appropriate for a child at this age?\n\n【7】A. He should ride in a rear-facing car seat in the back seat of the vehicle.\n\n【8】B. He should ride in a forward-facing car seat in the back seat of the vehicle.\n\n【9】C. He should ride in a forward-facing car seat in the front seat of the vehicle.\n\n【10】D. He should ride in a booster seat in the back seat of the vehicle.\n\n【11】Answer: 5.2 D . A child who weighs more than 20 lb and is older than 1 year of age may sit in a forward-facing car seat in the back seat of the car. A child who weighs more than 40 lb is usually big enough to use a booster seat, also in the back seat of the car.\n\n【12】Question: 5.3 A 4-month-old infant is brought into the family physician’s office for routine checkup and immunizations. Which of the following vaccines is routinely recommended at this time?\n\n【13】A. Diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis (DTaP)\n\n【14】B. Oral polio vaccine (OPV)\n\n【15】C. Measles, mumps, rubella (MMR)\n\n【16】D. Varicella\n\n【17】Answer: 5.3 A . DTaP is routinely recommended at ages 2, 4, 6, and 12 to 18 months, and at 4 to 6 years of age. Oral polio vaccination is no longer routinely recommended in children; the inactivated, injectable polio vaccine is recommended in its place and is recommended at ages 2, 4, 6 to 18 months and 4 to 6 years. MMR and varicella vaccination are recommended at ages 12 to 15 months and 4 to 6 years.\n\n【18】Question: 5.4 A 5-year-old child is brought into the pediatrician’s office for immunization and physical examination. The mother is concerned that her child is a little “under the weather.” Which of the following is a contraindication to vaccinating the child?\n\n【19】A. Acute otitis media with a temperature of 100°F requiring antibiotic therapy\n\n【20】B. Previous vaccination reaction that consisted of fever and fussiness that lasted for 2 days\n\n【21】C. History of an allergic reaction to penicillin\n\n【22】D. Previous vaccination reaction that consisted of wheezing and hypotension\nAnswer: 5.4 D . A previous anaphylactic reaction is a true contraindication to vaccination. Minor illnesses or vaccination reactions, even with fever, are not contraindications. Penicillin is not a component of vaccines and history of allergy to this medication is not a contraindication.\n\n【23】CLINICAL PEARLS\n\n【24】 True contraindications to providing vaccinations are rare; acute care visits are an excellent opportunity to provide childhood vaccinations.\n\n【25】 SIDS is the leading cause of death in infants younger than age 1 year. Parents should place their children on their “Back-to-Sleep.”",

She has been treated by her pediatrician for atopic dermatitis (AD). The pediatrician has been treating the areas with topical hydrocortisone 2.5% cream, which has not helped control the symptoms. Her mother states that despite using generous emollients and hydrocortisone, the girl scratches rigorously at night and is unable to concentrate during school due to pruritus. She has a past medical history of moderate intermittent asthma and allergic rhinitis, and her mother reports a strong history of asthma on her side of the family without any dermatologic issues. On physical examination, there is extensive generalized xerosis of the skin with areas of eczematous lichenified plaques, many with secondary excoriations and hypopigmentation 通用删除7(英):<u>( 1 )</u>.\n\n【4】i. What is the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis?\n\n【5】ii. What are the ‘atopic stigmata’?\n\n【6】iii. What treatments are on the therapeutic ladder for atopic dermatitis?\n\n【7】Answer 1\n\n【8】i. Atopic dermatitis also commonly known as eczema, is a common chronic inflammatory disorder of the skin, with a prevalence of up to 30% in children and 10% in adults. Atopic dermatitis is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. There are two sets of genes that have been implicated: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> genes encoding epidermal proteins such as filaggrin ( FLG ) and serine protease inhibitor LETKI ( SPINK5 ) and 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> genes encoding immunologic proteins such as high-affinity IgE receptors ( FCER1A ), toll-like receptor-2 ( TLR-2 ) and different interleukins ( IL4, IL5, IL12B, IL13 ), among others. Ichthyosis vulgaris, which is an autosomal semidominant disorder of the skin caused by a mutation in FLG , is seen in up to 15% of patients with AD.\n\n【9】Due to genetic factors, patients with atopic dermatitis have an impaired epidermal barrier that is characterized by epidermal barrier dysfunction and increased transepidermal water loss as a result of an altered stratum corneum.\n\n【10】ii. Atopic stigmata are associated features observed in patients with atopic dermatitis. One of the most important cutaneous features observed in patients with atopic dermatitis is xerosis, characterized by dry skin with fine scale, often worse during the winter. Xerosis promotes pruritus, which can lead to inflammation through the release of proinflammatory cytokines by keratinocytes due to scratching.\n\n【11】Additional stigmata include palmar hyperlinearity, white dermatographism, periorbital darkening, pityriasis alba, infraorbital folds (Dennie–Morgan lines), hypodense lateral eyebrows (Hertoghe’s sign) and low hairline.\n\n【12】iii. Given the extent and areas of involvement, more potent topical steroids would be appropriate for this patient based on the therapeutic ladder for atopic dermatitis. Triamcinolone 0.1% is appropriate for use on most areas of the skin, excluding the skin folds and face, whereas thicker lichenified plaques can be treated with topical corticosteroids with high or very high potency such as fluocinonide or clobetasol, respectively. In addition to topical steroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus, pimecrolimus) have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of AD in prospective controlled trials. Adjunctive therapies include dilute bleach baths, oral antihistamines for antipruritic and sedative effects, cool mist room vaporizers and antibacterial soaps.\n\n【13】Other potential treatments include narrowband UV therapy, cyclosporine, azathioprine, methotrexate and mycophenolate mofetil. The use of systemic corticosteroids should be limited because other agents have a more favourable long-term side-effect profile.",

He had been working outside， paving a city street， when， according to witnesses， he said he needed to sit down and then collapsed. He did not lose consciousness at that time. His skin all over his body is red with very rapid capillary refill， and he is sweating profusely. He is correctly diagnosed with heat exhaustion， and treatment is begun. Which hypothalamic nucleus is involved in generating heat-dissipating responses?\n\n【13】AMedial hypothalamusBC\n\n【14】Lateral hypothalamus\n\n【15】Posterior hypothalamus\n\n【16】D.Anterior hypothalamus\n\n【17】30.1 1 A. Thermoreceptors in the skin are responsible for responses to cold. There are two areas in the body in which thermoreceptors are located： the skin and the anterior hypothalamus， specifically the preoptic area. These areas do not behave the same， however. There are significantly more cold receptors than warm in the skin and more warm receptors than cold in the hypothalamus. This means that skin-based thermoreceptors are more important for detect-ing cold conditions and hypothermia， while hypothalamic receptors are more important for detecting warm conditions and hyperthermia. Of course in an extreme example such as this， both the skin and the hypothalamic thermore-ceptors would be generating signals to conserve or generate body heat.\n\n【18】30.2FB. The posterior hypothalamus generates the signals that cause an increase in heat conserving and producing behaviors. The posterior hypothalamus is also involved in sympathetic outflow， which is important in heat conserva tion. Sympathetic outflow is responsible for peripheral vasoconstriction and piloerection， both of which are heat conserving. Shivering， which is a heat-generating mechanism， is not mediated by the sympathetic system but rather by the shivering center， found in the dorsomedial posterior hypothalamus. Posterior hypothalamic projections to the cortex are involved in the more complex behavioral responses to cold， such as putting on more clothing， pacing， and going inside. The anterior hypothalamus， while being the location of hypothalamic thermoreceptors， is more sensitive to heat than cold and is involved in heat-dissipating activities.\n\n【19】30.3 D. The anterior hypothalamus is the area involved in heat-dissipating activities. It receives warm signals primarily from the preoptic hypothalamus but also from warm receptors located in the skin. Heat-dissipating activities include cutaneous vasodilation， achieved by sympathetic inhibition， which causes the skin to appear very red， and sweating. All heat-conserving activities are inhibited as well. There are also cortical responses to overheating， including fanning， removing clothing， and drinking cold drinks.\n\n【20】Thermoregulation is controlled primarily by neural feedback mechanisms operating through the hypothalamus， namely the preoptic area.\n\n【21】Involuntary responses for heat conservation are initiated by the hypothal-amus and include vasoconstriction， piloerection， and thermogenesis (ie， sympathetic excitation and shivering).\n\n【22】Fever differs from hyperthermia in that during a fever， the body's thermoregulatory set point itself is elevated， whereas in hyperthermia， body temperature rises above the set point.\n删除20：<u>Bear MF， Connors BW， Paradiso MA， eds.

Such overgrowth of skin is often  删除换行1 stimulated by virus.\n\n【2】Warts may occur at any age but are most common  删除换行1 in children, adolescents and young adults. The symptoms  删除换行1 are usually disfiguring. Warts tend to occur on sites of  删除换行1 trauma e.g hands, feet and genital region. These lesions  删除换行1 first appear as small smooth nodules, when they are better  删除换行1 palpable than inspectable. Sometimes these are quite  删除换行1 painful as seen on the sole. These are usually multiple.\nThe presumed mode of transmission is virus, contact or  删除换行1 autoinoculation. Warts are only painful if they are rubbed  删除换行1 or become infected.\n\n【3】Once warts appear, they may persist for many years  删除换行1 or regress spontaneously. Sometimes family history may  删除换行1 be obtained.\n\n【4】Three types of warts may be seen :—\n\n【5】1. The common warts, which have been described 删除换行1 above.\n\n【6】2. Senile warts (Basal cell papilloma).\n\n【7】3. Venereal warts or papilloma accuminata.\n\n【8】1. The common warts can be conveniently classified  删除换行1 into 3 groups —\n\n【9】(a) Verruca vulgaris is the most frequent type and  删除换行1 occurs anywhere on the skin or oral mucosa — the  删除换行1 common area is the hands. These are greyish white or  删除换行1 brown and are covered with rough, horny surface.\n\n【10】(b) Verruca plana or flat wart is mainly seen on  删除换行1 the face and dorsal surface of the hand. This is slightly  删除换行1 elevated, flat, smooth, papules measuring approximately 2  删除换行1 to 5 mm across.\n\n【11】(c) Verruca plantaris or palmaris is hyperkeratotic  删除换行1 lesion measuring approximately 3 to 15 mm across. As  删除换行1 the name suggests it occurs mainly on the sole or palm.\n\n【12】Histological features of all these warts includeSKIN AND SUBCUTANEOUS TISSUE 17 删除换行1 epidermal hyperplasia, vacuolisation of the cytoplasm  删除换行1 of keratinocytes and presence of eosinophilic cytoplasmic  删除换行1 inclusions and deeply basophilic nuclei.

Both sexes are equally affected.\nIn men it usually appears in the 5th decade or later,  删除换行1 whereas in women it occurs at the time of menopause.\nOne may find a familial history as it is often transmitted  删除换行1 by autosomal dominant gene. It is a benign tumour, often  删除换行1 pigmented and develops in the large numbers on the  删除换行1 trunk, arms and face.\n\n【15】Pathologically it consists of two layers, the base is  删除换行1 formed by dermis and the outer surface is formed by  删除换行1 thin keratotic epidermis. Between these 2 layers there is  删除换行1 plenty of immature epidermal cells which may be carried  删除换行1 to the surface for shedding.

As mentioned above it is more  删除换行1 common on the upper trunk and face. This lesion hardly  删除换行1 shows any tendency towards spontaneous regression.\n\n【17】Treatment is removal by curettage which gradually  删除换行1 heals with normal epithelium in about a week's time.\nCryosurgery is now being performed with better success.\n\n【18】3. Venereal wart or Condyloma acuminatum.— These  删除换行1 occur on the penis, perianal area, rectum, perineum and  删除换行1 female genitalia. This lesion appears as soft, tan, raspberryor cauliflower-like mass. Venereal warts are often seen in  删除换行1 the coronal sulcus of the penis. These are multiple and  删除换行1 moist warts with offensive serous discharge.\n\n【19】Venereal warts are treated by (i) fulguration with  删除换行1 diathermy or (ii) by podophyllin — 10 to 20% solution  删除换行1 with tincture benzoin is used.\n\n【20】IiASAL CELL CARCINOMA (SYN. RODENT 删除换行3 ULCER)\n\n【21】This is a locally invasive carcinoma of the basal layer  删除换行1 of the epidermis. It is of low grade malignancy. This is 删除换行1 particularly liable to occur in fair and dry skinned people  删除换行1 constantly exposed to sunlight. Elderly subjects are usually  删除换行1 affected.\n\n【22】Aetiology.—\n\n【23】1. Elderly people are usually affected. The  删除换行1 patients are in middle or late age.\n\n【24】2. It affects males more often than females.\n\n【25】3. It is particularly seen in the white residing in  删除换行1 tropical countries.\n\n【26】4. It grows very slowly, often over a course of  删除换行1 many years.\n\n【27】5- Exposure to sunlight seems to be an important  删除换行1 aetiologic factor, that is why this lesion is usually confined  删除换行1 to the face.\n\n【28】6. Rodent ulcer is particularly prevalent in \n\n【29】Australia and is confined to white people of the labour  删除换行1 class whose skin is exposed to the bright sunlight of  删除换行1 high actinic value.\n\n【30】7. It is seldom seen in the black people.\n\n【31】8. The tumour is frequently multiple and the  删除换行1 multiple growths may be confined to one area or may  删除换行1 occur in different areas.\n\n【32】9. Multiple basal cell carcinomas may develop in  删除换行1 persons following prolonged administration of arsenic  删除换行1 usually in the form of liquor arsenicalis. Arsenic was also  删除换行1 previously used in skin ointments.\n\n【33】10. 90% of basal cell carcinoma is seen in the  删除换行1 face above a line from the corner of the mouth to the  删除换行1 lobule of the ear. The commonest site being around the  删除换行1 inner canthus of the eye.\n\n【34】Pathology.—\n\n【35】Macroscopic features.— Although it is called rodent  删除换行1 ulcer, many of the lesions are nonulcerated. The different  删除换行1 macroscopic types are :—\n\n【36】(i) Deeply eroding ulcer or rodent ulcer. Such an  删除换行1 ulcer has a typical rolled edge (not everted), often beaded  删除换行1 and the floor showing scabbing over some areas and  删除换行1 breaking at others. This is the commonest type.\n\n【37】(ii) Nodular type.\n\n【38】(iii) Cystic type •— a large semi-transparent nodule  删除换行1 with darkly translucent colour as it contains water with  删除换行1 a network of fiery red blood vessels on the surface.\n\n【39】(iv) Pigmented nodule, in which the whole or part  删除换行1 of the lesion is dark brown in colour. See Fig. 1.15.\n\n【40】(v) Field fire or Forest fire or Geographical variety\n\n【41】— with advancing edge and healing centre. It has an  删除换行1 irregular raised edge around flat white scar.\n\n【42】(vi) Morphoric type, in which the lesion is a firm  删除换行1 raised red plaque.\n\n【43】Microscopic features.—\n\n【44】Ir consists of densely packed islands of darkly stained  删除换行1 cells which extend down from the epidermis, although  删除换行1 often no connection with the epidermis may be seen.\nThe cells on the periphery of the islands are more deeply  删除换行1 stained and have palisade' arrangement. There are no  删除换行1 cell nests or keratinisation. Prickle cells are also absent.\nMitotic figures are usually absent. Stromal component is  删除换行1 composed of benign fibrovascular tissue and chronic  删除换行1 inflammatory cells.\n\n【45】Basal cell carcinomas have varying rate of growth.\nSome remain small for long period of time, while others  删除换行1 grow rapidly and destroy large areas. Those that ulcerate  删除换行1 early, particularly in the nasolabial fold, behave  删除换行1 aggressively.\n\n【46】Origin.—\n\n【47】As mentioned earlier the common belief is that the  删除换行1 basal cell carcinoma arises from the basal layer of the  删除换行1 epidermis. But occasionally a basal cell tumour arises from  删除换行1 the basal cells of the hair follicles and sweat glands. Such  删除换行1 tumours are mostly seen in the scalp and adolescents are  删除换行1 the usual victims. Such tumour is called 'turban tumour' or  删除换行1 epithelioma adenoides cysticum'.\n\n【48】Spread.—\n\n【49】Basal cell carcinoma usually spreads by local invasion.\nIt gradually destroys the tissues it comes in contact with.\nThat is why this tumour is called 'rodent ulcer'. Lymphatic  删除换行1 spread is not seen, so the regional lymph nodes are not  删除换行1 enlarged. Similarly blood spread is also extremely rare.\n\n【50】Clinical features.—\n\n【51】SYMPTOMS.—\n\n【52】The principal complaint is of a persisting lesion —\n\n【53】either an ulcer or a nodule. It is not painful in the  删除换行1 beginning, though it may itch. The lesion grows slowly  删除换行1 and a little bleeding may be complained of. If untreated  删除换行1 rodent ulcer 删除换行1 becomes quite big  删除换行1 and deep. It then  删除换行1 may cause pain and  删除换行1 bleeding and may  删除换行1 become infected.\n\n【54】Basal cell carcinoma  删除换行1 is more known for  删除换行1 its multiplicity.\n\n【55】LOCAL EXAMINATIONS.—\n\n【56】(i) Site .—\n\n【57】Though no site is  删除换行1 exempted, yet 90%  删除换行1 of basal cell  删除换行1 carcinoma is seen  删除换行1 on the face above  删除换行1 the line drawn  删除换行1 from the angle of  删除换行1 the mouth to the  删除换行1 lobule of the ear.\n\n【58】The common sites are :\n\n【59】(a) Around inner canthus of the eye.\n\n【60】(b) Around outer canthus of the eye. Fig. 1.19.\n\n【61】(c) Nose.\n\n【62】(d) On and around nasolabial fold. Fig. 1.18.\n\n【63】(e) On the forehead — more common in 删除换行1 females.\n\n【64】In fact, the rodent ulcer may be seen more  删除换行1 commonly in places of the face over which tear rolls  删除换行1 down. That is why it is aptly called a ' Tear cancer .\n\n【65】This lesion is also seen in the scalp, neck, arms  删除换行1 and hands (i.e. the exposed areas of skin).\n\n【66】(ii) The lesion.— The tumour always starts as a\n\n【67】删除3：<u>Fig.1.16.— Dotted areas are the  删除换行1 common sites of basal cell carcinoma.</u>\nThe density of dots indicate frequency  删除换行1 of incidence of this type of carcinoma.\nIt is commonest around inner canthus  删除换行1 of the eye and around the nasolabial  删除换行1 furrow along the line on which tear rolls  删除换行1 down. That is why this cancer is often  删除换行1 called Tear Cancer.'\n\n【68】删除3：<u>Fig.1.17.— A pigmented basal cell carcinoma </u>\n\n【69】删除3：<u>Fig. 1.15.— Shows an early lesion of basal cell carcinoma at the outer canthus of the eye. It is often difficult 删除换行1 showing a small 'pearly' nodule. to differentiate from a melanoma.SKIN AND SUBCUTANEOUS TISSUE 19 删除换行1 nodule. Gradually the centre of the nodule dies and an  删除换行1 ulcer results. Such an ulcer has a rolled edge i.e. raised  删除换行1 and rounded (not everted cf. epithelioma). As the growth  删除换行1 spreads, the shape of the ulcer becomes irregular. An  删除换行1 irregular raised edge around a flat white scar is sometimes  删除换行1 called a field fire or geographical basal cell carcinoma.</u>\nWhen the ulcer erodes deeper structures, the edge becomes  删除换行1 more prominent, but does never become everted.\n\n【70】The floor of a rodent ulcer is covered with a coat of  删除换行1 dried serum and epithelial cells. If this sheds off, the  删除换行1 ulcer will bleed.\n\n【71】The base of the ulcer consists of the tissue which  删除换行1 the tumour is eroding, either fat or muscle or bone.\n\n【72】If the centre of the nodule dies an ulcer is formed,  删除换行1 if it does not die the nodule continues to develop. The  删除换行1 nodule gradually becomes large and may look cystic. But  删除换行1 it should be remembered that being a solid tumour, it  删除换行1 cannot be truely cystic, though 'cystic rodent ulcer' term  删除换行1 can be used. It is neither fluctuant nor does it contain  删除换行1 fluid inside it, though some oedema may be present.\n\n【73】(iii) Regional lymph nodes — are usually not enlarged.\nIf these are enlarged the diagnosis should be reconsidered.",

Changes in the brain seen on computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are diagnostic.\n\n【6】Answer: 51.1 C. Although CSF analysis may show patterns suggestive of viral infection, it is not diagnostic. IgM testing in the serum and CSF is useful clinically; however, any flavirus may lead to false-positive results. CT and MRI may show certain changes, but these patterns are not pathognomonic for WNV infections.\n\n【7】Question: 51.2 A 54-year-old woman presents to you, along with her family, which consists of her healthy adult husband and healthy teenage children, because her grandmother recently was diagnosed with WNV encephalitis and has had serious complications. Two days ago several members of her immediate family experienced myalgias, arthralgias, and subjective fevers. Which of the following should be offered to minimize complications and provide treatment?\n\n【8】A. Empiric broad spectrum antibiotics to prevent bacterial superinfection\n\n【9】B.

Empiric antibiotics and antivirals have no evidence in terms of reducing the severity of illness, duration of illness, or prevention of other sequelae. Persons with infection should be taught hand hygiene and advised to avoid large groups to people to avoid further spread. Sending people who are otherwise well but have mild WNV infection to the emergency department would only cause spread of illness to other ill persons. Annual influenza vaccination now includes H1N1 vaccination and is recommended for nearly all persons annually during flu season. However, administration of this vaccination during an acute illness does not treat the current illness.\n\n【14】Question: 51.3 Which of the following persons are most likely to develop complications of WNV?\n\n【15】A.

At age 30, she developed right visual loss and was found to have bilateral visual field defects and a pituitary macroadenoma 删除33：<u></u>. She had also noted an increase in hand and foot size, difficulty biting down because of malocclusion of her jaw, headaches, sweating, and snoring. She had heavy menstrual cycles that were irregular and treated with birth control pills for several years.\n\n【13】Magnetic resonance imaging of three pituitary glands of a person with pituitary tumorspituitary macroadenoma. The first image is a preoperative image, the second image is 6 weeks post-operation, and the third image is 2 years post-operation.

( c ) Two years post-radiation imaging: Interval decrease in size of enhancing soft tissue in the left aspect of the sella extending into the left cavernous sinus and floor of the left middle cranial fossa. The mass continues to encase the left cavernous internal carotid artery</u>\n\n【16】On exam she had facial changes consistent with acromegaly including broadening of her nose, widening of her forehead, thickening of her lips, coarsening of her facial features, spaces between her teeth, macroglossia, thickening of her fingers, and doughy hands. She had multiple skin tags on her face and her back. Laboratory studies indicated an insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) level of 900 ng/ml (normal, 53–351), random growth hormone (GH) level of 56 ng/ml (normal <7), and prolactin level of 57 ng/ml (normal, 0.1–23.3). Her other hormonal function testing before surgery showed a normal free T4, normal TSH, and a normal cosyntropin stimulation test. Hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis could not be assessed reliably given that she was on birth control pills.\n\n【17】She underwent transsphenoidal surgery. Pathology revealed a sparsely granulated somatotroph adenoma, with an elevated KI-67 proliferation index of 4%. Six weeks postoperatively, her MRI showed partial resection of the large macroadenoma with residual lesion in the left cavernous sinus 删除33：<u></u>. Three months postoperatively, mild central hypothyroidism developed, and IGF-1 level improved but remained elevated . The IGF-1 level failed to normalize on a maximal dose of first-generation somatostatin analog (lanreotide 120 mg per month). Pegvisomant was added. On the combination of lanreotide 120 mg per month and pegvisomant 30 mg per day, she achieved biochemical control with normalization of the IGF-1 level at 237 ng/ml 通用删除7(英):<u>(53–331)</u> while taking on oral contraceptive, as she was advised to avoid pregnancy while receiving medical therapies for acromegaly. However, she wanted to conceive as soon as it would be safe to do so. Given the high KI-67, suggestive of possible aggressive tumor behavior and the significant residual tumor, radiation therapy was administered.\nTable 12.1 删除换行 Longitudinal biochemical results for the patient preconception\n\n| Three months postoperatively a  | Three months postoperatively a  | Three months postoperatively a  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Hormone  | Serum concentration  | Normal range  |\n| Am cortisol (μg/dl)  | 31  | 5–25  |\n| Prolactin (ng/mL)  | 18  | 1–23  |\n| IGF-1 (ng/ml)  | 711  | 53–351  |\n| Free T4 (ng/dL)  | 0.8  | 0.9–1.8  |\n| TSH (μIU/L)  | 0.12  | 0.4–5  |\n\n| Two years post-radiation therapy/baseline prior to ovulation induction b  | Two years post-radiation therapy/baseline prior to ovulation induction b  | Two years post-radiation therapy/baseline prior to ovulation induction b  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cortisol (μg/dl)  | 14 c  | ≥18  |\n| Prolactin (ng/mL)  | 29.7  | 1–23  |\n| IGF-1 (ng/mL)  | 711  | 53–351  |\n| Free T4 (ng/dL)  | 1.6  | 9–1.8  |\n| TSH (μIU/L)  | <0.01  | 0.4–5  |\n| FSH (IU/mL)  | 7.2  | 3–30  |\n| Estradiol (pg/ml)  | 7  | 12–332 d  |\n| MIF (ng/ml)  | 146  | 0.7–7.5~  |\n\n【20】Abbreviations: IGF-1 , insulin growth factor 1, MIF Mullerian inhibitory factor 删除换行1 <sup>a </sup> On birth control pills 删除换行1 <sup>b </sup> Off birth control pills 删除换行1 <sup>c </sup> 1 h post-cortrosyn administration 删除换行1 <sup>d </sup> Follicular phase normal range\n\n【21】Anterior pituitary hormone tests remained normal 6 and 12 months after radiation. However, 2 years post radiation, and off birth control pills for more than 8 weeks, she had no menstrual periods and developed severe fatigue. She was found to have hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, mild hyperprolactinemia, and adrenal insufficiency . She was treated with oral hydrocortisone 10 mg in the morning and 5 mg in the afternoon daily with improvement of symptoms. Pituitary imaging revealed ongoing resolution of tumor 删除33：<u></u>. Medical therapy (pegvisomant and the long-acting lanreotide) for acromegaly was discontinued in preparation for ovulation induction. In this setting, headaches recurred, and IGF-1 rose into the 500 ng/mL range. She was switched to cabergoline 2 mg per week with the goal of decreasing both the IGF-1 and prolactin levels. In addition, subcutaneous octreotide, short-acting, was administered at a low dose to control her headaches and stopped 3 days before ovulation induction. IGF-1 was minimally elevated, just slightly above the normal range, before ovulation induction with human menopausal gonadotropins (HMG) was begun. A low dose and slow regimen of HMG was started. Two cycles were aborted due to multiple follicles. On the third cycle, a singleton pregnancy was achieved with low-dose HMG for ovulation induction, along with intrauterine insemination following hCG trigger of oocyte release.\n\n【22】Cabergoline was stopped at conception. Thyroid replacement was increased by two pills per week, 28.6% in anticipation of increased needs of pregnancy. The free T4 level was planned for 1 month. Current dose of hydrocortisone was maintained, with suggested close monitoring of blood pressure and clinical follow-up planned. Monitoring for gestational diabetes and maternal fetal consult was suggested. Visual field testing every trimester was advised. Stress dose steroids were advised during active labor and at delivery.\n\n【23】Pathophysiology of Infertility in Patients with Pituitary Tumors\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【24】### Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Gonadal (HPG) Axis\n\n【25】Pulsatile-luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion are required for ovulatory function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Hypothalamic amenorrhea due to functional causes disrupts the secretion of GnRH resulting in low LH and FSH and may be associated with endogenous hypercortisolemia and low serum T4 and T3 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) may restore ovulatory function and fertility in the setting of congenital isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism due to GnRH deficiency and in hypothalamic amenorrhea due to functional disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. In the setting of pituitary lesions, pituitary surgery and/or pituitary radiation, the absence of, disruption of, or decrease in LH and FSH cause anovulation, which may be reversed with exogenous administration of gonadotropins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Women with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism have been found to have higher anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels than women with male factor or tubal causes of infertility 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> or compared to normal controls 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. A hypothesis is that higher AMH may be due to multiple antral follicles too small in size to be detectable by ultrasound 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】### Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Growth Hormone (HPGH) Axis\n\n【27】The ovary has GH and IGF-1 receptors. IGF-1 may augment LH and FSH signaling in granulosa cells. However, a direct GH involvement in follicular maturation is shown in GH receptor/growth hormone-binding protein (GHBP) mice knockouts which have a lower rate of ovulation, are threefold less responsive to gonadotropin treatment than the wild type, and cannot be rescued with IGF-1, suggesting that the GH effects on follicular growth are independent of IGF-1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. GHI is thought to have a beneficial effect on oocyte quality and possibly on endometrial receptivity when given during ovarian stimulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> with improvement in pregnancy rate and a trend toward a higher but not statistically significant improvement in live birth rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. However, studies of GH replacement in women with hypopituitarism are limited. On the other hand, GH excess has detrimental effects on fertility. Polycystic ovarian syndrome morphology has been reported as a consequence of exogenous GH therapy in women with hypopituitarism and those with isolated GH deficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Endogenous GH excess due to growth hormone-secreting tumors can also be associated with polycystic ovarian syndrome morphology and infertility 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Acromegaly, as in the clinical case described here, may cause infertility by four different mechanisms: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> high prolactin, either due to co-secretion with growth hormone or stalk effect, which inhibits GnRH, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> gonadotropin deficiency due to tumor mass, 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> gonadotropin deficiency due to surgery or radiation, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> GH and IGF-1 itself causing a polycystic ovarian syndrome-like state 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】### Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis\n\n【29】There are many interactions between the HPA and the HPG axis which are relevant when considering fertility in a patient with central adrenal insufficiency. Excessive amounts of endogenous or exogenous glucocorticoids (GC) inhibit LH secretion, thereby reducing estrogen and progesterone, and GC may cause endometrial resistance to gonadal steroids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. While primary adrenal insufficiency has been associated with decreased parity, the mechanism for the lower birth rates in women with adrenal insufficiency is not known 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 13 \\]</u>. Low adrenal androgens and/or GC over replacement could be responsible 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 13 \\]</u>, and both are theoretically applicable to patients with hypopituitarism and central adrenal insufficiency. However, these studies have been limited to women with primary adrenal insufficiency. During estrogen treatment in preparation for ovulation induction or during a stimulated cycle of ovulation induction, high estrogen levels will increase cortisol-binding globulin (CBG), resulting in higher serum cortisol levels, an effect that must be considered in interpreting results in this setting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】### Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Thyroid Axis\n\n【31】Normal fetal development requires thyroid hormone. Primary hypothyroidism during pregnancy is associated with adverse outcomes. While trimester-specific thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels have been identified for women with intact thyroid function, TSH measurement is not useful for women with central hypothyroidism. There is limited information regarding the diagnosis of central hypothyroidism during pregnancy. Low free T4 levels in the setting of low or inappropriately normal TSH would typically be diagnostic of central hypothyroidism but may be difficult to interpret during pregnancy. Free T4 by dialysis may be more reliable than other free T4 assays during pregnancy. A low total T4 would be indicative of central hypothyroidism in early pregnancy, or during a stimulated cycle with a high estradiol level, given the expected increase in total T4 due to estrogen-stimulated increase in thyroid-binding globulin (TBG). Therefore, a low total T4 likely reflects central hypothyroidism in patients with known pituitary disorders after conception.\n\n【32】It is known that hCG stimulates the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormones, such that in women with intact thyroid function, free T4 concentrations rise and TSH decreases beginning at 6 weeks of gestation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. The normal cutoffs for free thyroid hormone levels are not well defined, and the expected pattern of thyroid levels for women with impaired hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroidal axis during pregnancy is unclear. It is conceivable that women with borderline or mild central hypothyroidism may respond to HCG stimulation with sufficient production of thyroid hormone if the thyroid gland itself remains intact. There are no randomized prospective trials evaluating thyroid hormone replacement preconception in patients with pituitary dysfunction, known or suspected to have central hypothyroidism. However, it is reasonable to consider some of the same principles used in women without pituitary disease, including assessment of thyroid peroxidase antibodies if TSH is high or borderline high, adding iodine (150 ug per day) to avoid deficiency, and following thyroid levels at regular intervals’ preconception and during pregnancy. For women at risk for central hypothyroidism in whom the diagnosis is not confirmed, the proposed protocol of thyroid testing every 3 months of preconception and each month during pregnancy starting at 6–8 weeks is not unreasonable 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>.\n\n【33】### Posterior Pituitary/Diabetes Insipidus (DI)\n\n【34】Arginine vasopressin has an important role in the LH surge 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u> and in the activation of kisspeptin neurons 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u> in mice. However, women with DI may have normal ovulatory function. Oxytocin deficiency is not associated with reproductive dysfunction in mice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u> or women. In women with hypopituitarism who have previously untreated adrenal insufficiency and diabetes insipidus, GC replacement may unmask subclinical DI. This is relevant for any patient who has a risk of hypopituitarism who has begun on steroid replacement including but not limited to women with pituitary disorders who present preconception .",

Parvovirus B19 causes severe anemia because it preferentially infects erythrocyte precursors.\n\n【3】C. Parvovirus B19 can be diagnosed by detection of viral RNA using PCR or hybridization assays.\n\n【4】D. Parvovirus B19 can cause hydrops fetalis via transplacental infection of a fetus in a seropositive mother.\n\n【5】E. Parvovirus B19 is transmitted primarily by fecal–oral transmission and is highly prevalent in infants and young children.\n\n【6】Answer: 33.1 B. Parvovirus B19 binds preferentially to the erythrocyte blood group P antigen on erythroid precursor cells. Answers A, B, C, and E are incorrect. After entry, the single-stranded viral DNA genome is transported to the cell nucleus where the host DNA polymerase synthesizes the complimentary DNA strand. Parvovirus B19 infection can be diagnosed by direct detection of viral DNA, not RNA. The fetus of a seropositive mother is protected from infection by maternal circulating antibodies. Parvovirus B19 is primarily transmitted by respiratory secretions and is prevalent in school-age children.\n\n【7】Question: 33.2 A normally healthy 7-year-old girl is sent home from school with a suspected case of fifth disease as a result of her presenting with the initial symptoms of the infection. After being at home for a few days, her symptoms change indicating her transition into the second phase of the illness. Which of the following symptoms is the girl most likely experiencing during the second phase of parvoviral infection?\n\n【8】A. Aplastic crisis\n\n【9】B. Diarrhea\n\n【10】C. High fever\n\n【11】D. Skin rash\n\n【12】E. Swollen glands\n\n【13】Answer: 33.2 D. The second stage of parvoviral B19 infection is immune-mediated, and results in formation of a lacy skin rash occurring first on the face and then moves to the extremities. Answers A, B, C, and E are incorrect. Aplastic crisis occurs in hosts with sickle cell disease or other acquired hemolytic anemias, not in normally healthy individuals. Parvoviral infection does not cause gastrointestinal symptoms. Mild fever, not high fever, is a symptom that occurs in the initial stage of fifth disease. Parvoviral infection does not result in swollen glands.\n\n【14】Question: 33.3 Which of the following conditions would put an individual at increased risk for serious chronic illness following an infection with parvovirus B19?\n\n【15】A. Immunization with a live measles vaccine\n\n【16】B. Having sickle cell disease\n\n【17】C. Caring for a pet with canine parvoviral infection\n\n【18】D. Coinfection with influenza A virus\n\n【19】E. Not being immunized for poliovirus\nAnswer: 33.3 B. More serious complications of parvoviral B19 infection, such as aplastic crisis, can occur in hosts with sickle cell disease or other chronic hemolytic anemias. Answers A, C, D, and E are incorrect, as they are not associated with serious complications of parvovirus B19 infection.\n\n【20】MICROBIOLOGY PEARLS\n\n【21】 Parvovirus B19 is the smallest human DNA virus and replicates in mitotically active erythroid progenitor cells.\n\n【22】 Clinical manifestations in children include mild fever followed by rash with “slapped cheek” appearance, fetal infections: hydrops fetalis, and death.\n\n【23】 Clinical manifestations in adults include polyarthritis of hands, knees, and ankles (with or without rash); chronic infection may result in chronic anemia or aplastic crisis.\n\n【24】 No specific treatment or vaccination.",

He came in with a 20-day history of abdominal pain described as intermittent lower abdominal pain, with fever up to 39 °C, along with pharyngalgia. He was given infusion of first-generation cephalosporin for 1 day and erythromycin for 3 days at a local clinic, and then fever regressed. On Day 5, he had fever again and developed paroxysmal coughing with wheezing which was more serious in the morning and at night. He was treated with first-generation cephalosporin again for 7 days, the fever subsided. But he developed facial and body edema, and oliguria. Vitamin C was given one time and azithromycin infusion was given for 1 day. His facial edema, cough, and wheezing all deteriorated, and dyspnea was developed. After he received diuretics for 2 days and took traditional Chinese medication for 7 days, his edema improved. Sputum could be coughed up easily. But he still had cough with wheezing at night. The patient was fatigue, pale, sweaty when moving. He was hospitalized at a local hospital. The chest DR showed cardiomegaly. Echo showed significantly enlarged left ventricle, weak wall movement, and mild pericardial effusion. He was transferred to our pediatric cardiology ward as a patient with dilated cardiomyopathy.

        "text": "【0】Case 5.8 Left Knee Pain and Swelling\n删除11：<u>By Phoebe M. Heffron， MSN， PNP</u>\n\n【1】SUBJECTIVE\n\n【2】Maria is a 14-year-old female who presents with sudden onset left knee pain and swelling which began at soccer practice 10 days ago. Maria reports that the knee “gives out\" at times and that the pain has decreased in the last week and a half. She has used ice， ibuprofen， rest， and an ACE bandage with minimal decrease in swelling， though the pain has improved.\n\n【3】Past medical/surgical history： Significant for a previous second degree ankle sprain on the ipsilateral side and Lyme disease at ages 11 and 12 with symptoms of pain and swelling present in the left knee in the first Lyme infection. Maria has not previously had any surgeries.\n\n【4】Family history： Maria’s family history includes a maternal grandmother with diabetes， a maternal grandfather with coronary artery disease， a paternal grandfather with rheumatoid arthritis， and a paternal grandfather who died at age 80 from colon cancer.\n\n【5】Social history： Maria lives with her mom， dad， 17-year-old sister， 12-year-old brother， and 2 dogs. She has many friends， is an honors student， plays in the school orchestra， and plays basketball，tennis， and soccer for her school and town recreation leagues. Her family lives in a large house in an upper middle-class town， where her dad (an attorney) works full-time and her mom (who has a master's degree and works at a museum) works part-time. Maria feels very close with her family， denies use of tobacco or any substances， denies depressive symptoms but does see a psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner for some anxiety she experienced following her witnessing a fatal car acci-dent. (She reports that her anxiety is much improved and that she has never required medication for this).\n\n【6】Medications： Cetirizine， as needed for seasonal allergies， and a multivitamin and calcium supple-ment daily.\n\n【7】Allergies： Seasonal allergies， an allergy to stone fruits and an allergy to penicillin.\n删除个例：<u>Clinical Case Studies for the Family Nurse Practitioner， First Edition.

(IgG is elevated but IgM is within normal limits indicating a previ ous—but not current—infection with Lyme disease).\n\n【49】What is the most likely differential diagnosis and why?\n\n【50】Tear of the ACL：\n\n【51】Regardless of the test results， one can be fairly confident that the diagnosis is an ACL tear. It may be harder to determine the certainty of concurrent MCL tear. However， the history of sudden onset knee pain during a high-risk activity with recurrent\"giving out\" and decrease in pain is classic for an ACL injury. The physical exam is also typical for ACL injury.\n\n【52】What is your plan of treatment?\n\n【53】Recommend that Maria continue rest， ice， compression， and elevation (RICE) therapy until she is seer by the orthopedist. Prescribe crutch use. (Note： Some providers will recommend use of an immobiliz-ing brace， but this practice varies. Know the preference of the orthopedist to whom you are referring the patient.) Instruct Maria about exercises to work on ROM (especially extension) and quadriceps strengthening. Provide educational materials 删除10：<u>(Heffron & Daley， 2010)</u>， including some frequently asked questions with answers and a guide to other useful resources. The orthopedist's plan for Maria is likely to include a recommendation that she undergo ACL reconstruction surgery to repair the torn ligament. The recommendation for the specific type of surgical procedure and graft type will vary both by surgeon but also based on the skeletal maturity-or status of growth plate closure and esti-mation of remaining growth potential-for the particular patient.\n\n【54】What is your plan for follow-up care?\n\n【55】You should see Maria again after she has seen the orthopedist to review her options and answer any questions. If possible， provide a network of patients who have been through this experience so that Maria can talk to others with similar experiences. Provide psychosocial support through-out the pre-surgery， surgery (if undertaken)， and rehabilitation process. Consider talking to Maria's coach(es) about incorporating an ACL injury prevention program into the regular routine for their team(s).\n\n【56】Are any referrals needed?\n\n【57】A referral to orthopedics is warranted. Potentially， a referral to a counselor， psychiatrist， or psycholo-gist (especially one involved in sports psychology and/ or experienced with pediatric patients) may be helpful. However， Maria has seen a psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner before， so she may already be comfortable with this professional. A referral for physical therapy may be appropriate， depending on the provider’s relationship with the pediatric orthopedist to whom she is referring the patient and the orthopedist’s preference for management during the acute post-injury phase.\n\n【58】Does the patient's psychosocial history impact how you might treat this patient?\n\n【59】In this case， there is not any difference in treatment based on psychosocial history； but， given Maria's struggles with anxiety， it is important to make sure that she feels like she is knowledgeable and 删除换行1 empowered to make decisions and manage her care. It is important to gauge the patient's response to the situation and determine the need for a mental health referral.\n\n【60】What if this patient was male?\n\n【61】These injuries are less common in males， but similar treatment considerations regarding skeletal maturity would apply.\n\n【62】What if the patient was over age 18 or under age 13?\n\n【63】If the patient was over age 18， she'd likely be at skeletal maturity； and standard adult reconstruction procedures could be used. If she was under 13， she'd be more likely to have wide open physes；and perhaps delayed surgical reconstruction would be the most appropriate treatment option.\n\n【64】What if the patient was also diabetic or hypertensive?\n\n【65】Standard procedures should be used for any diabetic or hypertensive patient undergoing surgery(i.e.， extra insulin to compensate for the stressful situation).\n\n【66】What if the patient lived in a rural， isolated setting?\n\n【67】This might limit access to a pediatric orthopedic specialist but should not otherwise impact the plan or care.\n\n【68】What kind of education should you provide to the patient regarding future injury prevention to protect against recurrence or injury to the contralateral side?\n\n【69】The patient is likely to have many questions. An information sheet may help the patient with an ACL injury based on some commonly asked questions 删除10：<u>(Heffron & Daley， 2010)</u>.\n\n【70】Are there any standardized guidelines that you should use to assess or treat this case?\n\n【71】The major guiding principle in the management of ACL injuries is the importance of skeletal maturity. Skeletal maturity will help determine the appropriate treatment modality for a particular patient with an ACL tear. Different surgical techniques have been developed to try to prevent growth disturbance that may result from the use of standard adult reconstruction procedures； and in adolescents with wide open physes， delayed surgical intervention may be the most appropriate modality.",

Her  删除换行1 mother has made her come along because she has noticed a marked weight loss in her daughter over the past few weeks. She has also noticed that her daughter seems pale and unwell.\nNormally, when she presents to the surgery the young woman wears baggy clothes and is not  删除换行1 forthcoming, and there have been times when the GP has suspected an eating disorder. The  删除换行1 patient’s body mass index (BMI) hovers around 19, but an eating disorder has always been  删除换行1 denied by the patient and her mother. The GP has never noticed the patient being as thin as  删除换行1 she is now. The patient has a younger brother 12 years of age and they live with their parents  删除换行1 on the local estate. The girl has not had any serious illness but the GP has seen her on a number of occasions with minor disorders such as sore throats and coughs and colds. It appears  删除换行1 that she and her mother do not get along very well, but it has never been possible to work out  删除换行1 what is really going on. It has been frustrating and worrying for the GP who has taken the  删除换行1 situation to the surgery clinical meetings on a number of occasions but the practice has not  删除换行1 been able to get to the bottom of the problem.\n\n【3】The GP assumes that the girl is suffering from a worsening of the suspected eating disorder  删除换行1 and hopes that this time they will finally be able to tackle the problem. However, on questioning the girl further, the GP is surprised when the girl tells her that she has been feeling  删除换行1 really thirsty recently and passing lots of urine, even getting up at night a few times to go to  删除换行1 the toilet.\n\n【4】Questions\n\n【5】• What is the probable diagnosis?\n\n【6】• What does the GP do now?\n\n【7】• What should the GP be concerned about in the months that follow?\n\n【8】ANSWER 100\n\n【9】With the classic signs of polydypsia, polyuria and weight loss the girl probably has type 1  删除换行1 diabetes mellitus.\n\n【10】The GP finds glucose and ketones in the urine and a finger-prick blood glucose reports ‘HI’.The girl’s BMI is now down to 17. With signs of ketoacidosis, the GP refers her straight to hospital where it is found that she has borderline acidosis and ketosis, a blood sugar of 34 mmol/L  删除换行5 and an HbA1C (glycated haemoglobin) of 15.8% (149.2 mmol/mol). The patient is admitted  删除换行1 from casualty for treatment and she started on insulin. She talks with the diabetic nurse  删除换行1 specialist and the dietitian about her condition and its management. After 14 days, her blood  删除换行1 glucose control has improved dramatically. Diabetic retinal screening and foot examination  删除换行1 are normal. The diabetic clinic plans to refer her to the 5-day Dose Adjustment For Normal  删除换行5 Eating (DAFNE) programme at 6 months, after the initial period of attempting best control.\n\n【11】The GP must still keep in mind, the possibility of an eating disorder as well as the diabetes.\nAn eating disorder and type 1 diabetes in a teenage girl is a dangerous mix. It has been estimated that one in three young women with diabetes abuse their insulin, missing injections  删除换行1 to stay thin, leading to a greatly increased risk of diabetic complications. This young patient  删除换行1 needs rapid access to psychological care and support, with close monitoring to help her manage her condition effectively. The GP hopes that the diabetes has at least given a way in to  删除换行1 treating other family and psychological problems.\n\n【12】• Keep your mind open to possibilities when eliciting a history.\n\n【13】• Signs of ketoacidosis in a patient with suspected diabetes mellitus require urgent  删除换行1 referral to hospital.\n\n【14】• ‘Diabulimia’ as it has been termed – missing injections to stay thin – is a common  删除换行1 and dangerous condition in women with diabetes.\n删除12：<u>Key Points207\n\n【15】</u>",

        "text": "【0】CASE 60: HAEMATURIA AND FLANK PAIN\n\n【1】History\n\n【2】A 25-year-old Caucasian man visited his GP complaining of pain in his lower back and  删除换行1 passing red blood in his urine. He had no dysuria or fever. He is generally fit and well,  删除换行1 working as a mechanic. He takes no regular medications and has no significant medical  删除换行1 history. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. There is no family history of relevance. His  删除换行1 only other complaint was of cold-like (coryzal) symptoms for the past few days.\n\n【3】Examination\nThere were no significant findings by the GP. His blood pressure was 125/65 mmHg. A  删除换行5 urine dipstick in the surgery did demonstrate haematuria and trace protein. In view of his  删除换行1 symptoms of flank pain and haematuria he was admitted to hospital under the urology  删除换行1 team. He underwent a CT scan of his kidneys, ureters and bladder, which did not identify  删除换行1 a cause. He was observed for two days as an inpatient; his flank pain settled with analgesia, with improvement in the haematuria.\n\n【4】INVESTIGATIONS\n\n【5】 Normal range\n\n【6】White cells 5.0 4–11 ¥ 109/L\n\n【7】Haemoglobin 15.0 13–18 g/dL\n\n【8】Platelets 250 150–400 ¥ 109/L\n\n【9】Sodium 138 135–145 mmol/L\n\n【10】Potassium 4.0 3.5–5.0 mmol/L\n\n【11】Urea 6.5 3.0–7.0 mmol/L\n\n【12】Creatinine 75 60–110 mmol/L\n\n【13】Urine microscopy: \n\n【14】Numerous red blood cells, no red cell casts, no organisms seen\n\n【15】Questions:\n\n【16】• What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【17】• What are the potential immediate problems that might occur, and how would you  删除换行1 manage them?\n\n【18】• How should this patient be followed up?\nANSWER 60\n\n【19】The key findings here are frank haematuria and flank pain. There was no previous history  删除换行1 of illness or dysuria, or systemic features. Of note, he appears to have had a recent upper  删除换行1 respiratory tract infection. Initial investigation of his urine confirmed haematuria but no  删除换行1 infection. No obvious lesion was identified on CT imaging. His observations and blood  删除换行1 chemistry were also normal. His condition remained stable and resolved.\n\n【20】The most likely diagnosis with his presenting features is IgA nephropathy. Other differentials to consider are post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis and Henoch–Schönlein  删除换行1 purpura.\n\n【21】IgA nephropathy is the most common glomerular disease worldwide. It occurs most  删除换行1 commonly in those of Asian or Caucasian origin and is more common in males (2:1).\nMost cases occur between the ages of 20 and 30. Most cases are sporadic and the cause  删除换行1 is not identified, but it tends to occur following an upper respiratory tract infection or  删除换行1 gastrointestinal infection.\n\n【22】IgA nephropathy is caused by the deposition of IgA in the glomerular mesangium.\nSometimes IgG and complement can also deposit on the mesangium and this is associated with more severe disease. Diagnosis can only be confirmed by renal biopsy and  删除换行1 microscopy.\n\n【23】Cases can present in several ways. About half of all cases present as in this case with  删除换行1 frank haematuria and flank pain after an upper respiratory tract infection. A third of  删除换行1 patients can present with asymptomatic microscopic haematuria. Ten per cent of patients  删除换行1 can present with a more severe process characterized by either the nephrotic syndrome  删除换行1 or an acute rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (oedema, hypertension, haematuria  删除换行1 and renal failure).\n\n【24】In this case his symptoms were limited and transient. No complicating features were  删除换行1 noted. Systemic features are common and include fever, malaise and myalgia.\n\n【25】A urine dipstick test for proteinuria should be performed to identify cases of nephrotic  删除换行1 syndrome or acute rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. Blood pressure should also be  删除换行1 checked as a potential presentation is malignant hypertension.\n\n【26】A full renal profile should be checked to rule out renal failure (raised creatinine and urea,  删除换行1 hyperkalaemia, metabolic acidosis). Other blood/serological tests should be performed to  删除换行1 rule out other causes of glomerular disease, including complement C3 and C4, anti-GBM \n\n【27】(glomerular basement membrane), ANCA (antinuclear cytoplasmic antibodies), ANA \n\n【28】(antinuclear antibodies), hepatitis virology and HIV.\n\n【29】If the course of the illness is progressive or severe (e.g. renal failure or persistent haematuria/proteinuria) a renal biopsy is required. Findings to support a diagnosis are  删除换行1 mesangial deposition of IgA with or without C3.\n\n【30】Cases of persistent proteinuria (with or without hypertension) should be treated with an  删除换行1 angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB).\nThese drugs reduce the amount of proteinuria but their role in preventing renal dysfunction is not established.\n\n【31】If a renal biopsy shows changes in keeping with active inflammation, or there is persistent haematuria, there is a role for corticosteroids. A prolonged course (6–12 months or  删除换行1 more) may be required.\nWith more severe disease on biopsy and rapid deterioration in renal function, combined  删除换行1 immunosuppressive therapy is indicated (e.g. prednisolone with cyclophosphamide or  删除换行1 azathioprine). In crescentic glomerulonephritis, pulsed intravenous methylprednisolone  删除换行1 followed by oral prednisolone and cyclophosphamide is used. Plasmapheresis is another  删除换行1 alternative but its use is not commonplace. In some cases of acute renal failure, renal  删除换行1 replacement therapy may have to be instituted.\n\n【32】The patient in this case should undergo specialist follow-up. Urinalysis, renal function  删除换行1 and blood pressure should be checked six-monthly. As his case is mild and self-resolved  删除换行1 he does not need long-term follow-up unless there is recurrence with or without progressive symptoms and signs, development of renal failure or hypertension.\n\n【33】KEY POINTS\n\n【34】• IgA nephropathy is the most common glomerular disease worldwide.\n\n【35】• It can present asymptomatically or with acute renal failure, haematuria, hypertension  删除换行1 and oedema.\n\n【36】• Definitive diagnosis is by renal biopsy, but most cases do not require this unless there  删除换行1 is significant proteinuria, persistent haematuria or renal impairment.删除6：<u>This page intentionally left blank 141</u>",

There, the mass was diagnosed and treated as an abscess using surgical debridement, saline irrigation, and antibiotics. When the mass recurred, a biopsy was obtained and submitted for histopathologic examination. The iguana was referred for treatment options.\n\n【6】Despite the large mass on his leg, the iguana exhibited normal behavior and activity at home. He had been eating, drinking, and defecating normally. Review of his care revealed excellent husbandry conditions at home. The diet consisted of a variety of fresh vegetables such as yellow squash, zucchini, apples, sweet potatoes, carrots, spinach, spring mix lettuce, peas, green beans, bok choy, and cabbage and dandelions. The lizard was housed in a habitat that provided the recommended captive environmental requirements for the species.﻿\n\n【7】Physical Examination Findings\n\n【8】The iguana was bright, alert, and responsive. He weighed 4.2 kg and was in good body condition. There were no other abnormalities noted aside from the mass on his left rear limb. The mass was located on the ventral aspect of his thigh and appeared to be associated with one or more of the femoral pores. It was approximately 4 cm in diameter and ulcerated 删除33：<u></u>.﻿\n\n【9】Other Diagnostic Information\n\n【10】Blood was drawn from the caudal vein using the lateral approach and submitted for a complete blood count (CBC) and diagnostic profile .\n\n【11】Radiographs that were taken 3 months prior to presentation accompanied the patient 删除33：<u></u>.\n\n【12】The mass was surgically removed on the day of admission into the veterinary hospital. Anesthetic induction was provided by intravenous propofol (10 mg/kg) and maintained using isoflurane following intubation (2.0 mm tube).\n\n【13】During surgery, a sterile marking pen was used to determine the appropriate surgical margins that would allow tissue apposition once the mass was excised. A number 15 blade was used to incise the skin around the mass in order to make a fusiform-shaped defect. The mass was superficial to the underlying musculature and was well encapsulated. Metzenbaum scissors and electrocautery were used to excise the mass within the capsule. The one large vessel entering the proximal aspect of the mass was occluded with hemoclips and transected. Careful dissection around the mass was completed, and the mass was successfully removed within its capsule 删除33：<u></u>. Prior to placing the mass in 10% neutral buffered formalin for histology, an imprint was made from the freshly cut surface for cytodiagnosis 删除33：<u></u>. The skin was closed in two layers. The subcutaneous layer was closed using 3-0 glycomer 631 suture, with a few simple interrupted tension sutures followed by a more superficial simple continuous pattern.

The plasma biochemistry profile revealed hypoglycemia, hypoproteinemia, hypoalbuminemia, hypophos-phatemia, hypocholesterolemia, hyponatremia, and hypochloremia. Explanation for these findings in an otherwise healthy-appearing iguana was challenging. It is possible that the published reference values used do not represent reference values that might have been obtained from the laboratory used to analyze the plasma sample. These findings may have resulted from anorexia owing to long transport associated with recent travel to the veterinary hospital. Lymphatic fluid dilution of the plasma sample would be another possible explanation; however, this was not supported by the CBC findings performed on the same blood sample. The hyperkalemia does not fit with the last two explanations, and if true, suggests either excessive intake of potassium, acidosis, or decreased urinary excretion of potassium. Repeat examination of these plasma analytes would be in order.\n\n【20】Table 69.2 .

        "text": "【0】Subchapter 8.3\n\n【1】Extra Large Export: A Case for Cisternal Maturation <sup>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></sup>\n==================================================================\n\n【2】Introduction\n------------\n\n【3】Collagen is an abundant protein found in the extracellular matrix of animals. You probably have heard about collagen in the context of tendons and skin. Collagen forms a stiff fiber that is made up of three long polypeptide chains that assemble into a twisted helix, stabilized in part by hydrogen bond formation between the side chains (R groups) of proline. The enzyme prolyl hydroxylase reacts with the proline in collagen to help to promote proper folding of the triple helix inside the RER. Activity of prolyl hydroxylase requires ascorbic acid , better known as vitamin C, as a cofactor.\n\n【4】Collagen is synthesized and secreted from fibroblast and osteoblast cells. Because collagen is destined to exit the cell, translation of preprocollagen polypeptide mRNAs is targeted at the RER. After entering the RER the signal sequence is removed and initial folding of individual polypeptide strands occur. Proper alignment of the three polypeptides is made possible by the presence of globular propeptides located at the amino and carboxyl-terminal ends of each polypeptide. The final product is a 300 nm long microfibril of procollagen ( PC ). Procollagen is then transported from the RER to the Golgi complex and eventually out of the cell. Misfolded microfibrils are unable to travel to the Golgi and will accumulate inside the RER. Only after PC has left the cell do PC peptidases cleave off the globular propeptides, allowing the microfibrils to assemble into fibrils that finally assemble into collagen fibers forming an important part of the extracellular matrix.\n\n【5】▪ What is the difference between a “polypeptide” and a “protein?”\n\n【6】▪ Conduct a search for images or diagrams of the molecular structure of collagen microfibrils and fibers. Can you find micrographs of collagen as part of the extracellular matrix.\n\n【7】▪ Examine the chemical structure of the amino acid proline. Explain why proline is capable of participating in the formation of a hydrogen bond.\n\n【8】▪ Scurvy is a disease caused by lack of vitamin C in a person’s diet. Some of the symptoms include bleeding of the gums and tooth loss, inability of wounds to heal, and joint pain. Suggest why lack of vitamin C might cause these symptoms?\n\n【9】▪ How do the mRNAs for secretory proteins get targeted at the RER?\n\n【10】▪ What was the likely function of the ”pre” portion of the protein preprocollagen?\n\n【11】▪ Predict what would happen if the globular propeptides were removed from PC while it was still inside the cell?\n\n【12】Background\n----------\n\n【13】The endomembrane system of a eukaryotic cell consists of a series of membrane-bound organelles that can be thought of as “connected” by the movement of proteins and lipids between them. Proteins, like PC, that must be exported out of the cell are synthesized on the RER, travel through the individual cisternae or stacks of the Golgi complex, and finally exit the cell at the plasma membrane. Two models have been proposed to explain the transport of proteins through the Golgi complex. The vesicular transport model proposes that Golgi cisternae are stable membrane compartments. Each cisterna contains a characteristic set of enzymes that function to modify proteins as they pass through the compartment. Based on this model, proteins are carried forward from one compartment to the next in small, membrane-bound transport vesicles. In contrast, the cisternal maturation model states that Golgi cisternae are dynamic organelles that are constantly being formed from the RER and that change their function or “mature” with time. Proteins remain within a Golgi cisterna and are modified as a result of changes in the population of enzymes. According to this model a cis Golgi compartment “matures” into a medial Golgi cisterna and a medial Golgi compartment “matures” into a trans Golgi cisterna due to the backward transport of enzymes between the cisternae.\n\n【14】Cisternal maturation helps to explain how very large protein aggregates can move through the Golgi complex. Proteins like PC are too large (300 nm) to fit into a transport vesicle (50–90 nm) and yet these proteins are glycosylated just like the smaller, soluble proteins that are known to travel in transport vesicles. The cisternal maturation model predicts that protein aggregates would remain in the lumen of a single Golgi cisterna as that membrane compartment matures from cis to trans . The synthesis and transport of PC by chick embryonic fibroblast cells was examined in this case study with the goal of testing the validity of the cisternal maturation model.\n\n【15】▪ List the organelles that are a part of the endomembrane system.\n\n【16】▪ Create a diagram that illustrates the two models of protein transport through the Golgi complex.\n\n【17】▪ Research/review the nature of transport vesicles in the endomembrane system. How do COPI vesicles differ from COPII vesicles?\n\n【18】▪ Describe the relationship between a protein’s amino acid sequence and its function.\n\n【19】Methods\n-------\n\n【20】### Primary culture of chick embryo fibroblast cells\n\n【21】Primary cultures of fibroblast cells were isolated from a 15-day-old chicken embryo tendons (ET) by incubation in the presence of 3 mg/mL collagenase in tissue culture media. Cells were harvested from the media by filtering through cheesecloth followed by centrifugation. The fibroblast cell pellet was resuspended in tissue culture media and plated into glass chamber slides coated with 30 μg/mL fibronectin. Cells were incubated for 18 h at 37°C before use in any experiments.\n\n【22】### Immunofluorescence\n\n【23】Cultured ET fibroblast cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. The cells were rinsed with buffer and incubated with antibodies that recognize the carboxy-terminal domain of PC (LF68 antibody) and the Golgi-specific integral membrane protein giantin . The cells were then incubated with fluorescent-labeled secondary antibodies.\n\n【24】### Immunoelectron microscopy\n\n【25】ET fibroblast cells were fixed and permeabilized as described previously. The cells were incubated with a monoclonal antibody specific to the folded form of PC (hCL通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>) followed by incubation with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody. In the presence of 0.001% hydrogen peroxide (H <sub>2 </sub> O <sub>2 </sub> ), the HRP enzyme catalyze a reaction with 0.075% 3,3’-diaminobenzidine tetrachloride (DAB-HCl) to form an insoluble precipitate that appears as a dark electron-dense region in the electron micrograph.\n\n【26】### PC “wave” protocols\n\n【27】Movement of PC from the RER through the Golgi was synchronized using two different protocols. Both protocols relied on the ability of the iron-chelating compound 2,2’-dipyridyl (DPD) to inhibit the proper folding of PC resulting in the retention of unfolded PC in the RER. The “exiting wave” protocol followed the movement of the population of PC proteins already present in the Golgi. ET fibroblast cells were treated with 0.3 mM DPD for 0–60 min, fixed, and reacted with a monoclonal antibody to folded PC. Since DPD inhibits the folding of PC, the only proteins that the antibody can react with are proteins that had already left the RER. The “incoming wave” protocol also used 0.3 mM DPD to block the exit of PC from the RER; however, in this protocol the cells were incubated in the DPD until the PC proteins already present in the lumen of the Golgi had exited the cell. Washing out the DPD and supplementing the media with ascorbic acid (vitamin C) allowed PC to fold properly and exit the RER as a single wave of protein. Localization of the folded PC was achieved using the same fold-specific antibody. Cis to trans polarity of the Golgi in both protocols relied on the presence of clathrin-coated vesicles as markers for the trans Golgi compartment.\n\n【28】### Assay of PC release\n\n【29】Cells were grown as described previously and treated with DPD following either the “exiting wave” or “incoming wave” protocols. Tissue culture media was collected at time points after the addition (exiting wave) or removal (incoming wave) of 0.3 mM DPD. Fresh media were added to the cells following each collection. Proteins present in the media were precipitated using 10% trichloroacetic (TCA) acid and were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using a polyclonal antibody to PC (Sp1.D8). The intensity of the stained bands was quantitated using image analysis software.\n\n【30】▪ Use your own words to define the terms primary culture and immortalized cell line .\n\n【31】▪ What effect did incubation with collagenase have on the tissue?

        "text": "【0】Case Files™ Neurology, Second Edition    \n\n【1】### CASE 22\n\n【2】A 48-year-old man complains of “numbness and stiffness” in his arms for the past 4 months. His gait has gradually deteriorated because of unsteadiness. On examination the patient appears older than his stated age. His hair is nearly completely gray. There is slight limitation of head movement to either side, but no pain with neck extension. His tongue is red and depilated. His gait is broad based, and he is unable to walk a straight line. He is able to stand with his feet together with his eyes open, but he nearly falls when his eyes are closed. He has normal arm coordination but is ataxic on the heel–knee–shin maneuver. Deep tendon reflexes (DTRs) are 3+ in the arms, 3+ at the knees, and absent at the ankles. Both plantar responses are extensor. The patient has a jaw jerk and a positive snout reflex. There is a stocking decrease in sensation and a marked decrease in vibration and joint position sense in the toes and ankles. Cranial nerves are normal, and there are mild problems with memory and calculation. T2-weighted MRI of the brain demonstrates extensive areas of high-intensity signal in the periventricular white matter. MRI of the spine shows a hyperintense signal along the posterior column of the spinal cord.\n\n【3】 What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【4】 What is the next diagnostic step?\n\n【5】 What is the next step in therapy?\n\n【6】### ANSWERS TO CASE 22: Subacute Combined Degeneration of the Spinal Cord\n\n【7】Summary : This is a 48-year-old patient who complains of a progressive gait disorder characterized by sensory ataxia caused by impaired position sense and spasticity. His examination is significant for both peripheral and central nervous system involvement, primarily affecting the white matter fibers of the posterior columns of the spinal columns and pyramidal tracts and large myelinated peripheral nerve affecting coordination and muscle tone.\n\n【8】• Most likely diagnosis : Vitamin B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> deficiency\n\n【9】• Next diagnostic step : Vitamin B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> level and if positive, subsequent testing to determine the source of B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> malabsorption\n\n【10】• Next step in therapy : Intramuscular vitamin B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> supplementation\n\n【11】#### ANALYSIS\n\n【12】##### Objectives\n\n【13】1\\. Understand the range of pathologic and clinical manifestations of vitamin B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> deficiency.\n\n【14】2\\. Know the differential diagnosis of vitamin B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> deficiency.\n\n【15】3\\. Understand the types of tests to confirm the diagnosis and etiology of vitamin B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> deficiency.\n\n【16】4\\. Be aware of the proper mode of repletion of vitamin B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> .\n\n【17】##### Considerations\n\n【18】The pertinent features of this case include the unsteadiness of gait, and numbness and stiffness. The physical examination helps localize the pathology. There is a stocking pattern decrease in sensation, specifically vibration and joint position sense, which strongly suggests a neuropathy involving large myelinated fibers. Involvement of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord, at or above the lumbar level is also a possibility. The pathologically increased reflexes in the arms along with the presence of primitive reflexes are “upper motor neuron signs” and suggest involvement of the corticospinal tract above the level of the cervical spinal cord. In this case, one would expect increased reflexes in the legs also, unless there is also a coexistent neuropathy. The ataxic heel–knee–shin maneuver also points to aberrant input to the cerebellum, which comes through large fibers. The mild problems on mental status examination indicate a cortical disorder. All of these findings suggest involvement at multiple levels of the nervous system. The imaging study confirms involvement of myelinated regions in the spinal cord, specifically the dorsal columns and in the brain. Assuming all these signs/symptoms are manifestations of a single entity, a systemic disease should be considered, such as HIV-1-associated vacuolar myelopathy, Lyme disease, multiple sclerosis, neurosyphilis, or vitamin B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> deficiency. Peripheral nerve disorders (neuropathic) would not be expected to give upper motor neuron signs. Another clue on physical diagnosis is the abnormal tongue and prematurely graying hair.\n\n【19】#### DEFINITIONS\n\n【20】BABINSKI SIGN/PRIMITIVE REFLEXES : Elicited reflex response present in newborns, which disappears with neurological development in association with progressive myelination of the nervous system. These “infantile” reflexes include the palmo-mental (contraction of ipsilateral chin mentalis muscle with stimulation of palm), snout (protrusion of lips with touching or tapping of lips), jaw jerk, and grasp reflex (closure of hand/fingers with placement of object in hand). The Babinski reflex is characterized by extensor response to the toe possibly in association with abduction of toes with stimulation of the sole or lateral side of the foot. It is present in infants and neonates and in association with disruption of the corticospinal tract of the brain and spinal cord.\n\n【21】NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES : An electrodiagnostic study of peripheral nerve function (nerve signal velocity and amplitude) often in conjunction with electromyography, which is used to assess muscle function or dysfunction.\n\n【22】### APPROACH TO: Subacute Combined Degeneration of the Spinal Cord\n\n【23】Spinal cord diseases are common, and many are treatable if discovered early. The spinal cord is a tubular structure originating from the medulla of the brain and extending through the bony spine to end at the level of the upper lumbar vertebrae. Ascending sensory and descending motor white matter tracts are located peripherally; posterior columns govern joint position, vibration and pressure, lateral spinothalamic tracts pain and temperature, and ventral corticospinal tracts carry motor signals.\n\n【24】#### VITAMIN B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> DEFICIENCY\n\n【25】Vitamin B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> deficiency usually presents as paresthesias in the hands and feet and loss of vibratory sense. There is a diffuse effect on the spinal cord, primarily the posterior lateral columns, explaining the early loss of vibratory sense. Late in the course, optic atrophy and mental changes as well as ataxia can occur. Macrocytic anemia is common.\n\n【26】Cyanocobalamin is a compound that is metabolized to a vitamin in the B complex commonly known as vitamin B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> . Vitamin B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> is the most chemically complex of all the vitamins. The structure of B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> is based on a corrin ring, which is similar to the porphyrin ring found in heme, chlorophyll, and cytochrome. The central metal ion is cobalt (Co). Once metabolized, cobalamin is a coenzyme in many biochemical reactions, including DNA synthesis, methionine synthesis from homocysteine, and conversion of propionyl into succinyl coenzyme A from methylmalonate. Dietary cobalamin (Cbl), obtained through animal foods, enters the stomach bound to animal proteins. Absorption requires many factors including stomach acid, R-protein, and intrinsic factor from gastric parietal cells, and the distal 80 cm of the ileum for transport. Interference in any of these points can lead to malabsorption of vitamin B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> . In addition, there are a number of inborn errors of metabolism that can both interfere with the absorption and action of vitamin B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> . The most common cause of vitamin B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> deficiency is malabsorption because of pernicious anemia, a condition where antibodies are generated to the parietal cells of the stomach, and the necessary binding proteins. There are many other causes, however, that should be considered.\n\n【27】Pathologically, in subacute combined degeneration (SCD), there is edema and destruction of myelin. Thus, the clinical presentation of SCD is caused by dorsal column, lateral corticospinal tract, and sometimes lateral spinothalamic tract dysfunction. The initial symptoms are usually paresthesia in the hands and feet. This condition can progress to sensory loss, gait ataxia, and distal weakness, particularly in the legs. If the disease goes untreated, an ataxic paraplegia can evolve. Specific findings on examination are loss of vibratory and joint position sense, weakness, spasticity, hyperreflexia, and extensor plantar responses. The syndrome of sensory loss as well as spastic paresis associated with pathologic lesions in the dorsal columns and lateral corticospinal tracts is referred to as subacute combined degeneration . There are also effects on other body systems, most conspicuously hematologic with the macrocytic anemia.\n\n【28】#### DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\n\n【29】The manifestations of vitamin B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> deficiency are noted in Table 22–1 . The differential diagnosis for progressive spastic paraplegia includes degenerative causes, demyelinating, infectious, inflammatory, neoplastic, nutritional, and vascular disorders (HIV-1-associated vacuolar myelopathy, Lyme disease, multiple sclerosis neurosyphilis, toxic neuropathy, Friedreich ataxia, and vitamin E deficiency). The differential diagnosis of SCD is broad, but vitamin B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> deficiency should be considered in any patient with progressive sensory symptoms or weakness.\n删除4：<u>Table 22–1 • CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS OF VITAMIN B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> DEFICIENCY</u>\n\n【30】#### LABORATORY CONFIRMATION\n\n【31】Testing for vitamin B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> deficiency includes a direct assay of the vitamin as well as looking at the indirect effect of abnormal reactions resulting in altered metabolite levels. The definitions of Cbl (vitamin B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> ) deficiency are as follows: Serum Cbl level <150 pmol/L on two separate occasions OR serum Cbl level < 150 pmol/L AND total serum homocysteine level >13 µmol/L OR methylmalonic acid (MMA) > 0.4 µmol/L (in the absence of renal failure and folate and vitamin B <sub class=\"calibre12\">6 </sub> deficiencies). The hemato-logic manifestations of vitamin B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> deficiency can be mimicked by folate deficiency, but this does not mimic the neurologic manifestations. High MMA levels and normal B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> levels indicate a functional deficiency likely due to abnormal cofactors needed for B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> action. In addition, the multiple organ systems and subsystems affected are highly variable from patient to patient.\n\n【32】Confirmatory effects of the anatomic and physiologic consequences of B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> deficiency involve nerve conduction studies and MRI. Few reported cases of MR imaging of SCD exist. Findings in these cases include modest expansion of the cervical and thoracic spinal cord and increased signal intensity on T2-weighted images, primarily in the dorsal columns and lateral pyramidal tracts.\n\n【33】#### TREATMENT\n\n【34】Treatment of vitamin B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> deficiency involves administering the vitamin in a fashion to bypass the pathologic steps in the transport process. This usually involves intramuscular administration of the vitamin, first to build up stores and then on a monthly basis. Specifically, 1000 µg/d for 1 week, then 1000 µg/wk for 1 month. Then 1000 µg/mo until the cause of deficiency is corrected, or for life in the case of pernicious anemia. This is effective for all forms of the deficiency. There are also methods of oral administration that are sometimes effective. Treatment can reverse or stop most if not all of the sequelae of vitamin B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> deficiency.\n\n【35】####",

Thyroid-stimulating hormone level\n\n【18】30.1 C. Ovarian failure due to follicular atresia is the reason for oligo-ovulation in the perimenopausal years. During perimenopause (or climacteric)， follicular atresia occurs from hypoestrogenemia， as do the vasomotor changes that lead to hot flushes. There is nothing dysfunctional occurring in this scenario， as it is a common occurrence in a perimenopausal patient.\n\n【19】30.2IF. Both hypothyroidism and hyperprolactinemia may cause hypothalamic dysfunction， which inhibits gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) pul-sations， which in turn inhibit pituitary FSH and LH release. The lack of gonadotropins，FSH and LH， leads to hypoestrogenic amenorrhea. A com-mon cause ofhyperprolactinemia in a girl of this age is a prolactinoma. This is not a pituitary problem， nor a receptor insensitivity issue. There is no pathol-ogy related to the ovaries； however， this patient will most likely be amenor-rheic due to the lack of stimulation to the ovaries by the gonadotropins.\n\n【20】30.33(G. This patient most likely has polycystic ovarian syndrome(PCOS). Women with PCOS often are obese and hirsute， have anovulation and insulin resis-tance， but an estrogen excess. Because of this， they are often prescribed pro-gesterone alone or combination oral contraceptive pills to induce vaginal bleeding and to prevent endometrial hyperplasia.\n\n【21】30.4 C. Ovarian failure is the most likely etiology in this woman with probable Turner syndrome (45，X). It would be reflected by elevated gonadotropin lev-els and streaked ovaries. She most likely has decreased estrogen levels as well， which predisposes her to complications such as osteoporosis later in life. This patient's symptoms result from a chromosomal abnormality and not a hypo-thalamic or pituitary dysfunction.\n\n【22】30.5 F. Excessive exercise may lead to hypothalamic dysfunction， but many times simple weight gain will lead to its restoration of function. This patient has amenorrhea， and therefore is in a hypoestrogenic state. This puts this patient at an increased risk of bone fractures. The “female athlete triad”of eating disorder， amenorrhea， and osteoporosis is associated with hypothalamic dys-function and hypoestrogenemia. Many times these individuals are placed on oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) in order to maintain normal hypothalamic function. There is no pathology related to the ovaries or pituitary in this scenario.\n\n【23】30.6 B. Sheehan syndrome is when the anterior pituitary suffers from hem-orrhagic necrosis associated with postpartum hemorrhage. She is unable to breast-feed due to her inability to release prolactin from the anterior pituitary. This patients symptoms are unrelated to the ovaries and hypo-thalamus. This patient would be in a hypoestrogenic state due to the lack of gonadotropin stimulation. Treatment for this would be supplemental hormonal replacement.\n\n【24】30.77A. Amenorrhea due to hyperprolactinemia causes a hypoestrogenic state due to decreased GnRH release， and decreased FSH and LH secretion. O var-ian estrogen levels are decreased， leading to decreased bone mineral den-sity. Hence， the DEXA scan is most likely to be abnormal. The endometrial biopsy is likely to be normal， or perhaps show atrophic changes due to the hypoestrogenic state， and certainly not likely to show hyperplasia or cancer. The mammogram would not be affected. The thyroid gland is not affected by hyperprolactinemia； rather， hypothyroidism can lead to hyperprolactinemia， not vice versa.\n\n【25】CLINICALPEARLS\nHot flushes and irregular menses after the age of 45 years are most likely due to the climacteric state (or perimenopause). These symptoms usu-ally respond to estrogen recommended to be given as a combination of estrogen and progestin (HRT).\n\n【26】Significant vasomotor symptoms are the current indication for hormone-replacement therapy in the menopausal woman， and the lowest dose should be used for the shortest duration feasible.\nThe most common location of an osteoporosis-associated fracture is the thoracic spine as a compression fracture.\n Weight-bearing exercise， calcium and vitamin D supplementation， and estrogen-replacement therapy are the important cornerstones in the prevention of osteoporosis.\nProgestin should be added to estrogen-replacement therapy when a woman has her uterus， to prevent endometrial cancer.\n\n【27】删除38：<u>)</u>Continuous estrogen-progestin therapy may be associated with a small but significant risk of cardiovascular disease and breast cancer.The sequence of biochemical markers in the life of the ovary is as follows：AMH falls first， inhibin Bnext， and then finally estradiol.\n\n【28】Pregnancy should be ruled out in any patient who presents with amenorrhea.",

He has signs of chronic liver disease and his liver function tests are  删除换行1 consistent with this. Other causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with liver  删除换行1 disease include peptic ulcer disease, Mallory–Weiss tear, portal hypertensive gastropathy  删除换行1 and gastric antral vascular ectasia. Thrombocytopenia is common in cirrhosis due to a  删除换行1 combination of reduced thrombopoietin levels, splenic sequestration of platelets and bone  删除换行1 marrow suppression.\n\n【26】The estimation of blood loss is often difficult from a patient’s story. Haematemesis is a frightening symptom and the amount may be overestimated. The haemoglobin level in this case is  删除换行1 low and there is significant postural hypotension. His pulse is not fast as he is taking a beta  删除换行1 blocker. He has signs of chronic liver disease. This is likely to be a very serious bleed. Only  删除换行1 50% of patients with varcieal haemorrhage stop bleeding spontaneously, and there is a very  删除换行1 high risk of bleeding in the next 6 weeks.\n\n【27】The patient needs to be resuscitated with transfusion via a large-bore peripheral intravenous  删除换行1 line or a central line. FFP and platelets are needed to correct coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia, respectively. Intravenous antibiotics reduce infectious complications in hospitalised  删除换行1 cirrhotic patients.\n\n【28】Endoscopy is required to identify the bleeding point. Bleeding oesophageal varices should  删除换行1 be treated with oesophageal band ligation or sclerotherapy. Balloon tamponade is effective at  删除换行1 achieving short-term haemostasis, and may be used until more definitive treatment is available. Terlipressin or octreotide reduce bleeding. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic  删除换行1 shunts or surgery are reserved for patients who continue to bleed despite the above measures.\n\n【29】After he has been stabilised he needs to be asked questions about his alcohol intake. He  删除换行1 should be advised to abstain from alcohol. CAGE criteria consist of four questions and are  删除换行1 commonly used as a screen for alcoholism:\n\n【30】•\t Have you felt the need to Cut down drinking?\n\n【31】•\t Have you ever felt Annoyed by criticism of drinking?\n\n【32】•\t Have you had Guilty feelings about drinking?\n\n【33】•\t Did you ever take a morning Eye opener?\n\n【34】Key Points\n\n【35】•\t Acute variceal bleeds are less likely to stop spontaneously than other upper  删除换行1 gastrointestinal haemorrhages.\n\n【36】•\t The CAGE questionnaire is useful as a screening tool for alcoholism.\n\n【37】•\t In some surveys alcohol is linked directly to around 25% of acute medical admissions.",

X-ray of the chest reveals a 2-cm hilar mass that isidentified on biopsy as small cell lung cancer. On physical examination， the patient has some cachexiabut normal skin turgor， no edema or jugular venous distention， and no orthostatic hypotension. Relevant laboratory findings are as follows： Serum： Urine： Sodium： 128 mEg/L Sodium： Normal Potassium： 4 mEg/L Osmolality： 610 mOsm/kg H，O Blood urea nitrogen (BUN)： 8 mg/dL Glucose： 90 mg/dL  |\n| --- |\n| What is the most likely diagnosis?Hyponatremia.  |\n| How is the etiology of this condition determined? Volume status is assessed first. Although sodium loss can cause hyponatremia， excessive retention of wateris usually the cause. A thorough history and pfelhysical examination can help correlate the patient's volumestatus to a cause of hyponatremia， and laboratory values can be used to confirm volume status. The causeof fluid loss can be determined by history (eg， vomiting， diuretics， diarrhea) and physical findings of lowvolume (eg， decreased skin turgor， low jugular venous pressure). Signs of excessive fluid retention includeperipheral edema.  |\n| What laboratory findings can help determine a patient's volume status?Serum and urine osmolarity and sodium concentration can help confirm a patient's volume status. Mosthyponatremic patients have a decreased serum osmolarity； however， renal failure and hyperglycemia aretwo important causes of hyponatremia that accompany normal or increased serum osmolarity.In patients with low plasma osmolarity， urine osmolarity can differentiate primary polydipsia (low/normal urine osmolarity) from impaired water excretion (high urine osmolarity， as in the majority of patients). In patients with hypo-osmolar serum and hyperosmolar urine， urinary sodium can then distinguish betweenhyponatremia caused by circulating volume depletion (eg， from heart failure， cirrhosis， hypovolemia leadingto decreased urinary sodium) and euvolemic hyponatremia (eg， syndrome of inappropriate secretion ofantidiuretic hormone \\[SIADH\\] leading to normal urinary sodium).  |\n| In this case， what is the most likely etiology of the patient's volume status?This patient's small cell lung tumor raises the likelihood of SIADH (a paraneoplastic syndrome for small celllung cancer). Physical findings and lab values are also consistent with SIADH.  |\n| What are the major causes of this condition? ·Ectopic ADH production by a tumor， particularly · A wide range of drugs. small cell (oat cell) carcinoma of the lung. Major surgery， pain. Intracranial pathology， such as trauma， stroke， HlV infection. tumors， or infection. ●SIADH may also be idiopathic.  |\n| What is the mechanism of action of ADH? ADH is the main regulator of serum osmolality. ADH causes water channels (eg， aquaporin-2) of theprincipal cells of the kidney's collecting ducts to translocate to the cell membrane， thereby allowing morewater to be reabsorbed. Its release from the posterior pituitary is stimulated by hyperosmolarity and by decreased effective circulating volume.  |\n\n【3】decreased effective circulating volume.\n\n【4】What are the appropriate treatments for this condition?\n\n【5】Treatment consists of tumor resection. If evidence of SIADH persists or resection is not possible， treatment involves restriction of free water intake or use of hypertonic saline with loop diuretics or demeclocycline.",

It is situated just distal to the ulna and the triangular  删除换行1 fibrocartilage complex, proximal to the base of the hamate.\n\n【14】The superior surface presents a medial, rough, non-articular portion, and a lateral convex  删除换行1 articular portion, which articulates with the triangular articular disc of the wrist. The inferior surface, directed laterally, is concave, sinuously curved and smooth for articulation  删除换行1 with the hamate. The dorsal surface is rough for the attachment of ligaments. The triquetrum articulates on its radial side with the lunate to which it is attached by the lunotriquetral ligament.

She is on no other medication apart from the paracetamol.\n\n【3】She tells the GP that, over the past 2–3 weeks, she has been suffering from general pain and  删除换行1 stiffness, particularly in her thighs and both shoulders. Her GP is tempted to put this down  删除换行1 to her sadness and isolation as well as lack of exercise owing to her sore shoulder and fear of  删除换行1 going outside since she was mugged 删除25：<u></u>. However, the GP asks the patient to explain  删除换行1 her symptoms in more detail. She reports that these symptoms started quite suddenly and  删除换行1 that, in the morning when she wakes up, she has really bad and painful generalized stiffness, making it hard to move and that this stiffness lasts for at least an hour before easing. It  删除换行1 makes it particularly hard for her to walk up and down stairs and raise her good arm to get  删除换行1 dressed. After sitting for any length of time, the stiffness also becomes a real problem. She  删除换行1 is not feeling very well, has lost some weight and sometimes even feels that she is running a  删除换行1 bit of a fever. She has not had any recent respiratory tract or other infection and has not been  删除换行1 suffering from headaches. At times, the symptoms wake her at night and prevent her from  删除换行1 turning over in bed.\n\n【4】Questions\n\n【5】• What is the differential diagnosis?\n\n【6】• What other questions and examination should the GP focus on?\n\n【7】• What investigations might help?\n\n【8】ANSWER 60\n\n【9】The most probable diagnosis in this patient’s case is polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR). Other  删除换行1 possibilities are rheumatoid arthritis or other connective tissue disease, multiple myeloma  删除换行1 and depression.The GP should enquire about and carry out a full examination of the musculoskeletal system, particularly palpating the muscles for signs of tenderness, palpating the temporal  删除换行1 muscles to look for temporal arteritis and examining the peripheral joints for any synovitis. Investigations will include a full blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR),  删除换行5 C-reactive protein (CRP, usually raised with PMR) and liver function test (may be raised  删除换行1 alkaline phosphatase with PMR). In this case, the GP is fairly certain the diagnosis is PMR  删除换行5 as the woman is in the right age group, has muscle tenderness in the upper arms, prolonged  删除换行1 morning stiffness, an acute illness and weight loss. If the GP is not certain, additional tests  删除换行1 can include protein electrophoresis to exclude a myeloma, and rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibody to look for rheumatoid arthritis or other connective tissue disease. The  删除换行1 patient’s erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) comes back at 50 mm/hour and her CRP at  删除换行1 10 mg/L. The GP starts her on 15 mg prednisolone a day, which brings rapid relief of symptoms within a few days. In view of her age, and the risk of osteoporosis with the use of oral  删除换行1 steroids for over three months the patient is also given a bisphosphonate to be given as long  删除换行1 as the steroids are used. Over the next 18 months, she continues on a tapering dose of steroids  删除换行1 and her blood tests revert to normal.\n\n【10】• Multiple pathologies can occur.\n\n【11】• Do not blame everything on depression.\n\n【12】• A trial of medication is sometimes a very useful diagnostic tool.\n\n【13】• Watch out for iatrogenic disease such as osteoporosis.\n删除12：<u>Key Points123\n\n【14】删除测试2：<u>Case 61: Muscle Pain</u>\n\n【15】</u>",

        "text": "【0】##### CDMR from a public health perspective\n\n【1】In a world of finite resources, we might question the ethics ( distributive justice ) of promoting CDMR as a standard of care to endorse women’s autonomy when millions of citizens do not have access to even basic health coverage. If healthcare resources are diverted to increased Cesarean deliveries, theoretically such resources will not be available to others. Should individual women therefore bear financial responsibility for their CDMR just as they do for other “non-medically” indicated procedures such as cosmetic surgery? Limiting CDMR to women able to afford the extra cost of surgery, however, creates another inequality in healthcare access. How would this model take into account the percentage of women who ended up with an urgent, complicated, and costly unplanned Cesarean delivery after a failed trial of labor and delivery?\n\n【2】Finally, how do we anticipate the true cost of CDMR when most studies assessing such costs compare vaginal deliveries with all cesarean sections, including those with sicker women and/or babies? Taken to an extreme, if all women who wanted CDMR obtained it, the need for labor and delivery rooms, and the incidence of lengthy failed labors, urgent instrumental or cesarean deliveries would significantly decline, potentially being replaced by a less costly obstetrical practice. Although cesarean section without labor would seem to be more expensive than uncomplicated vaginal delivery, studies attempting to compare such costs are often methodologically flawed, involve few randomized trials, are plagued by inadequate power, and often omit important considerations including costs accruing to patients.\n\n【3】Other societal issues not directly related to costs include the medicalization of childbirth and a paradoxical transfer of power from women to the medical profession if CDMR becomes the norm.\n\n【4】##### CDMR from the anesthesiologist’s perspective\n\n【5】The anesthesiologist probably would not have been directly involved in the patient’s and obstetrician’s decisions regarding mode of delivery. However, one of the reasons cited by women choosing CDMR is fear of pain during labor and delivery, and adequate information and access to optimal labor analgesia may be crucial in shaping this discussion. Anesthesiologists are obliged to inform women that early neuraxial analgesia is safe and available. For women who fear loss of control, access to low-dose neuraxial labor analgesics with patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) may be one way to “avoid” a CDMR. Pain during and after Cesarean section is a major concern for women, and these issues also need to be addressed.\n\n【6】At minimum, the following information regarding general anesthesia should be discussed with Jane and Jim:\n\n【7】###### Maternal risks of general anesthesia\n\n【8】Anesthesia-related maternal mortality, though low, has been associated with difficult airway management and aspiration during induction of anesthesia and recovery.通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>12 </sup></u> However, these risks are clearly increased when patients are obese and surgery is unplanned and urgent, mitigating this concern when it is applied to elective surgery.\n\n【9】###### Risk of pain after Cesarean delivery\n\n【10】A woman who requests a general anesthetic to avoid all pain and discomfort during Cesarean section should be informed that the gold standard for post-Cesarean analgesia, neuraxial opioids, cannot be administered. The clear association of severe acute post-delivery pain, post-partum depression, and chronic pain must also be disclosed.\n\n【11】###### Risk of awareness during general anesthesia\n\n【12】Although the risk of awareness is low, this potentially traumatic and devastating outcome must be disclosed to women who are seeking the utmost comfort and stress-free experience when choosing a CDMR under general anesthesia.\n\n【13】###### Fetal risks of general anesthesia\n\n【14】A recent study in a cohort of very preterm infants comparing neonatal mortality after epidural, spinal and general anesthesia for cesarean reported no increased risk after general anesthesia when controlling for gestational age.通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>13 </sup></u> However, a large population-based study reported higher neonatal risks with general anesthesia even in scheduled cesarean sections.通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>14 </sup></u> Women therefore need to be informed that the risk for neonatal resuscitation and intubation are potentially higher after general anesthesia than after regional anesthesia.\n\n【15】Long-term effects of general anesthesia on the developing brain have been of growing concern,通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>15 </sup></u> but further studies are necessary before firm conclusions can be drawn regarding the adverse effect of short perinatal exposure to general anesthetics.\n\n【16】###### Alternative regional anesthesia\n\n【17】In order to make an informed choice the risks of alternatives, including regional anesthesia must also be discussed, including hypotension, inadequate anesthesia requiring conversion to general anesthesia, severe headache, nerve damage, epidural abscess or meningitis, epidural hematoma, and severe injury including paralysis. Benefits such as being awake to bond with the baby, and the opportunity for postoperative neuraxial analgesia should also be presented.\n\n【18】##### Can the anesthesiologist refuse to participate in CDMR?\n\n【19】Examples of refusal by physicians to provide anesthesia when it conflicts with their personal beliefs include abortions and care of Jehovah’s Witnesses undergoing scheduled surgery. The NICE guidelines give doctors the right to decline a request for a Cesarean section in the absence of an identifiable reason. However, Camman argues that unlike terminations of pregnancies or refusal of blood transfusion by Jehovah’s witnesses, elective Cesarean sections do not have a religious or moral component, since Cesarean section is an accepted medical intervention that does not intentionally result in harm or loss of life.通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>16 </sup></u> Refusal to provide anesthesia based on beneficence and nonmaleficence arguments are therefore stronger than those based on moral objection, although Gass, in a counter to Camman, has argued that there are moral grounds for refusal to participate in CDMR based on the utilitarian need to maximize societal benefit.\nConscientious objections could be applied to any treatment where the doctor might have personal beliefs that conflict with the patient’s. But rights of physicians to invoke conscientious objection is limited by the (usually) overriding duties to provide patient care. In the UK, the General Medical Council has stated the following通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>18 </sup></u> :\n\n【20】> You must make the care of your patient your first concern .\n> \n> You must treat your patients with respect, whatever their life choices and beliefs .\n> \n> You must not unfairly discriminate against patients by allowing your personal views to affect adversely your professional relationship with them or the treatment you provide or arrange .\n> \n> If carrying out a particular procedure or giving advice about it conflicts with your religious or moral beliefs, and this conflict might affect the treatment or advice you provide, you must explain this to the patient and tell them they have the right to see another doctor. You must be satisfied that the patient has sufficient information to enable them to exercise that right. If it is not practical for a patient to arrange to see another doctor, you must ensure that arrangements are made for another suitably qualified colleague to take over your role .\n> \n> You must not express to your patients your personal beliefs, including political, religious or moral beliefs, in ways that exploit their vulnerability or that are likely to cause them distress .\n> \n> \n\n【21】With regards to the choice of anesthetic, there is no difference between CDMR and any other Cesarean section. It is generally accepted that regional anesthesia is safer and better than general anesthesia. However, there may be cases, such as when the parturient’s anxiety and fear are so great – even if irrational – that her interests are best served by undergoing a general anesthetic.\n\n【22】The authors would personally be agreeable to Jane and Jim’s request to perform a Cesarean section as soon as fetal lung maturity has been established (or at 39 weeks), preferably under regional anesthesia. When the desires of a pregnant woman are in conflict with usual medical indications for treatment or with the best interests of the baby, the following key points should be kept in mind:\n\n【23】#### Key points\n\n【24】• The principle of respect for patient autonomy supports a pregnant woman’s rights to refuse recommended medical treatments, even if such refusal may be detrimental to her or to her fetus. Physicians generally are ethically obliged to honor these rights.\n\n【25】• The obligations of physicians to accede to requests for nonrecommended treatments are less straight forward.\n\n【26】• Principles of beneficence and nonmaleficence require that consideration be given to the maternal benefits against the maternal harms, as well as benefits and harms for the fetus.\n\n【27】• When patients request unnecessary interventions, additional ethical considerations include issues of distributive justice (does CDMR divert healthcare resources away from more basic needs to fulfill the wishes of a few privileged persons, or does it have the potential to reduce health care costs overall by avoiding the costs of complications of more traditional care?).\n\n【28】• Some patient care situations allow physicians to withdraw out of conscientious objection based in personal religious or moral beliefs, but refusing to provide requested and accepted (albeit unnecessary) therapies are better supported by arguments using principles of beneficence and nonmaleficence.\n\n【29】• When a physician objects to providing medical services that are acceptable within the standard of care, they have obligations to transfer the care of such patients to a suitably qualified colleague who can provide such care.\n\n【30】####",

She has a 3‐year‐old sibling who is healthy.\n增加换行1: Current Status\n--------------\n\n【7】The infant is admitted to the intensive care unit immediately after complete repair of TOF (i.e. closure of ventricular septal defect, narrowing of the pulmonary valve and right ventricular outflow tract is augmented by a combination of resection of obstructive muscle tissue in the right ventricle and enlargement with a patch). The operative course was uneventful. She is intubated and is on milrinone and epinephrine infusions. Temporary transcutaneous atrial and ventricular pacing wires are wrapped and secure on chest.

The magnesium level was low immediately postoperatively (0.8 mEq/L) and a dose of magnesium is administered. A 12‐lead EKG is ordered with findings of narrow‐complex tachycardia, inverted P waves, and ventricular–atrial dissociation These findings are consistent with junctional ectopic tachycardia (JET).\n\n【16】### What additional interventions and medications can be considered if the rhythm does not convert to sinus rhythm spontaneously?\n\n【17】Decreasing body temperature should be treated with acetaminophen and cooling blankets to maintain body temperature at 35.5°C (96°F). Administer amiodarone 5 mg/kg intravenous piggy back (IVPB) over 60 minutes, which can be repeated up to maximum total dose of 15 mg/kg. Reducing the inotropic epinephrine infusion support may be considered as it can contribute to tachycardia and arrhythmias.

It can be the result of edema or injury to the tissue surrounding the electrical conducting atrioventricular (AV) node and occurs in up to 10% of children after cardiac surgery. Risk factors include surgeries occurring near the AV node such as TOF and atrioventricular septal defect repair. Electrolyte imbalance, particularly low magnesium levels, can precipitate JET in the postoperative period as can low intravascular volume, fever, or high inotropic support. Successful treatment of JET is difficult and several steps may be needed, including antiarrhythmics, pacing, cooling, and electrolyte replacement in addition to maintaining normal intravascular volume. The use of amiodarone is considered by some to be a first‐line therapy, and when considered it can be done concomitantly with other cooling and replacement strategies. The rhythm, if a result of edema or inflammation, usually converts 24–48 hours after surgery.",

The rash appeared suddenly on her bilateral legs with firm, painful nodules underneath the skin and seemed to spread within 1 week. Her medical history is notable for hypertension, poorly controlled Crohn’s disease and fibromyalgia. On physical examination, there are numerous red-brown subcutaneous nodules that are painful to the touch on the patient’s anterior lower legs 通用删除7(英):<u>( 29 )</u>. A biopsy is performed and demonstrates a septal panniculitis with lymphocytes and scattered neutrophils.\n\n【4】i. What is the diagnosis?\n\n【5】ii. What are the common causes of this condition?\n\n【6】iii. What is the prognosis and treatment?\n\n【7】Answer 29\n\n【8】i. This patient presents with erythema nodosum (EN), which is a form of panniculitis that is considered to be a delayed hypersensitivity reaction. It can occur at any age and is seen equally across different sex and races. Erythema nodosum characteristically presents as painful erythematous subcutaneous nodules, most often located symmetrically on the anterior shins, thighs and forearms. Occasionally, systemic symptoms can be associated with EN, including arthritis, arthralgia, fever and malaise.\n\n【9】ii. Erythema nodosum is often observed in the setting of various systemic diseases, although the largest proportion of cases (up to 50%) is categorized as idiopathic. Infections are common causes of EN, most commonly streptococcal infections and less often, bacterial gastroenteritis and viral upper respiratory tract infections. Other causes of EN include drugs such as estrogens and oral contraceptives, penicillin and biologic agents, sarcoidosis and inflammatory bowel disease, with a stronger association observed between EN and Crohn’s disease than with ulcerative colitis. Less common causes of EN include Chlamydia trachomatis infections, Mycoplasma pneumonia infections, tuberculosis, hepatitis B, Sweet’s syndrome and pregnancy.\n\n【10】In the setting of Crohn’s disease, EN can be seen prior to or contemporaneously with a flare. The presence of EN is considered as a prognostic factor in some instances; EN is associated with a more benign and self-limited form of sarcoidosis.\n\n【11】iii. The treatment of uncomplicated, mild EN consists of bed rest, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and potassium iodide. For more severe cases, colchicine, prednisone, dapsone and hydroxychloroquine have been used with success in a small series of patients. Treatment of the underlying condition is an important component of the management of erythema nodosum.",

Different types of transport proteins are specific to different ions. While some transport proteins form an open channel for the passive diffusion of ions, others only allow transport to occur under certain circumstances. These gated channels undergo a conformation change, transitioning from a “closed” to an “open” state, and back again. Examples of the physiological triggers for gated channels include ligand binding, mechanical deformation, and changes in voltage across the membrane.\n\n【4】Voltage-gated channels are proteins that can respond to small changes in membrane potential or the distribution of charge across a phospholipid bilayer. Voltage-gated channels play a vital role in the process of nerve cell communication through their involvement in production of an action potential. In order for a voltage-gated protein to function it must be capable of “sensing” differences in charge across a membrane. Voltage-gated channels are integral membrane proteins with multiple, alpha helical, transmembrane domains. Some of these domains contribute to the formation of a channel that selectively allows for the diffusion of an ion. Other transmembrane domains are able to respond to changes in electrical charge due to the presence of acidic or basic amino acids.\n\n【5】▪ Explain why an ion must move through a transport protein and cannot simply diffuse through a phospholipid bilayer.\n\n【6】▪ What determines the direction of movement of an ion?\n\n【7】▪ Research/review examples of the three types of gated channels mentioned earlier.\n\n【8】▪ Describe the properties associated with a transmembrane domain.\n\n【9】▪ Predict how a transmembrane domain of a voltage-gated channel with arginine amino acids near the extracellular side of the membrane would respond to an increase in calcium ions outside the cell.\n\n【10】Background\n----------\n\n【11】The unicellular green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii swim through their aqueous environment using flagella. The coordinated movement of these two flagella, in a breaststroke-like pattern, propels the cell forward. Chlamydomonas are photosynthetic and so are attracted to light. However, exposure to intense light causes the flagella to change their beat pattern, switching to a more undulating or S-shaped pattern, and causing the cell to reverse direction, a behavior known as photophobic response . Alteration of the flagellar waveform requires an influx of extracellular calcium ions into the flagella.\n\n【12】The Chlamydomonas mutant, ppr2 , lacks a photophobic response. The ppr2 gene shares homology with voltage-gated calcium channels. A search of the Chlamydomonas genomic database revealed the presence of eight voltage-gated calcium channels genes that share sequence homology with ppr2 . The experiments described in this case study investigate the role of voltage-gated calcium channels in the photophobic response of Chlamydomonas .\n\n【13】▪ Are Chlamydomonas prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells?\n\n【14】▪ Speculate on why a photosynthetic cell would avoid intense light.\n\n【15】▪ What proteins are responsible for the movement of the flagellar axoneme?\n\n【16】▪ The Chlamydomonas eyespot responds to bursts of intense light by altering the cell’s membrane potential. How does this fact contribute to your understanding of the photophobic response?\n\n【17】Methods\n-------\n\n【18】### Cell cultures\n\n【19】Wild-type and mutant strain ppr2 of C. reinhardtii were used in these experiments. Cells were cultured at 25°C in TAP medium using a 12-h light, 12-h dark light cycle.\n\n【20】### Reverse transcriptase – PCR of regenerating flagella\n\n【21】Flagella were detached from the cells using pH shock, and total RNA was extracted from flagellar-regenerating cells at the times indicated. Equal amounts of total RNA were reverse-transcribed into cDNA using Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase. PCR was performed on each of the samples using primers that were specific to a 120–200 base pair fragment of fructose-bisphosphate aldolase 3, beta tubulin, or CAV2. Expression of fructose-bisphosphate aldolase 3 was assumed to be unaffected by flagellar regrowth. Calculation of the amounts of beta tubulin and CAV2 RNA were normalized to fructose-bisphosphate aldolase 3.\n\n【22】### RNA interference suppression of CAV2 expression\n\n【23】CAV2 gene expression was knocked down using RNA interference. Genomic DNA sequences corresponding to exons 1–3 of the CAV2 gene was inserted into an RNAi vector and wild-type Chlamydomonas were transformed by electroporation. Transformants were evaluated by the level of CAV2 expression and their ability to respond to high-intensity light.\n\n【24】### CAV2 antibodies\n\n【25】Polyclonal antibodies specific to CAV2 were developed. For immunoblotting, cells in the logarithmic growth phase were pH-shocked to remove their flagella. Flagella were collected by centrifugation and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by blotting onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were reacted with dilute primary antibody to CAV2, washed, and reacted with an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. Antibody binding was detected by chemiluminescence.\n\n【26】Localization of CAV2 and alpha tubulin in flagella was achieved by immunofluorescence labeling. Cells were fixed in 1.8% formaldehyde for 20 min and washed with buffer. Chlamydomonas were allowed to adhere to the glass slide and then the cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, washed with buffer, and reacted with the CAV2 primary antibody. The samples was washed again and reacted with a FITC-conjugated secondary antibody. Labeled cells were viewed using a fluorescence microscope.\n\n【27】▪ Why was it necessary to grow Chlamydomonas with a light/dark cycle?\n\n【28】▪ Predict how the RT-PCR experimental results would be altered if fructose-bisphosphate aldolase expression did change during flagellar regeneration.\n\n【29】▪ Why was a permeabilization step included for the immunofluorescence experiments?

        "text": "【0】CASE 28\n\n【1】An emergency medical team is called to help a 60-year-old woman with small cell lung cancer who is unconscious at work. Her coworkers state that for about10 seconds before she lost consciousness，she pointed to her right hand as it began twitching rhythmically， then stiffened every muscle and fell down. After about 15 seconds，she became incontinent and her arms and legs began jerking rhythmically. She then was still， unresponsive， and unconscious for about 3 minutes. The medical team notes she is now breathing deeply but remains unresponsive.\n\n【2】What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【3】Seizure. Involvement of the left motor cortex is implicated because the seizure started with right-handed motor activity. In this patient a metastasis is the likely culprit. Seizures can also be caused by infection， ischemia， drug exposure or withdrawal， certain ion imbalances including hypoglycemia and hyponatremia， and trauma.\n\n【4】How is this condition classified?\n\n【5】This is a simple partial seizure with motor signs secondarily generalizing into a tonic-clonic seizure. During the first 10 seconds， the patient maintained consciousness， pointing to a simple seizure (complex seizures require a loss of consciousness). After the first 10 seconds， her simple partial seizure evolved into a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. The tonic phase is characterized by the immobile contraction of all muscles， and the clonic phase is characterized by the bilateral rhythmic jerking of the extremities.\n\n【6】Why is the patient breathing deeply after her incident?\n\n【7】The patient is likely responding to acidosis. A respiratory acidosis can develop from the loss of coordinated respirations during the seizure， and a metabolic acidosis can develop as muscles contract under anaerobic conditions and produce lactic acid.\n\n【8】What is the appropriate treatment for this condition?\n\n【9】Popular antiseizure medications include valproic acid， phenytoin， phenobarbital， primidone， and carbamazepine. Many antiseizure medications work by enhancing y-aminobutyric acid (GABA) binding on chloride channels. GABA binding allows chloride ions to flow into neurons， thereby inhibiting neuronal firing. Barbiturates act on the same chloride channels and enhance GABA signaling by increasing the duration of chloride channel opening. Benzodiazepines act on the same channels and enhance GABA signaling， but they do so by increasing the frequency of chloride channel opening.\n\n【10】What are the most common adverse effects of treatment?\n\n【11】Adverse effects of seizure treatments are as follows：\n\n【12】·Valproate： Hepatotoxicity， neutropenia， thrombocytopenia， teratogenicity (neural tube defects in the fetus).\n\n【13】·Carbamazepine： Hepatotoxicity (check liver function)， aplastic anemia， agranulocytosis.\n\n【14】●Phenytoin： Gingival hyperplasia， teratogenicity.\n\n【15】Ethosuximide and lamotrigine： Stevens-Johnson syndrome (a bullous form of erythema multiforme that involves mucous membranes and large areas of the body).\n\n【16】· Carbamazepine and phenobarbital： Induction of cytochrome P450， resulting in drug interactions.",

The lifetime risk of MM in the United States is 1 in 132 (0.76%) and has a 30% 10-year survival rate in patients under 60 years of age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Hematopoietic cancers (HCs) , more commonly called blood cancers , are the malignancies of the hematopoietic stem cells. They are commonly caused by or are associated with chromosomal abnormalities such as translocations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. Blood cancers affect both the structure and function of the blood cells because of changes in their precursor cells. Hematopoietic stem cells are the primitive cells or precursor cells that can develop into all types of bloodlines. These bloodlines can be the myeloid lineage or the lymphoid lineage. These hematopoietic stem cells can be found in peripheral blood, bone marrow, or umbilical cord.\n\n【14】Blood cancers are divided into three main groups, leukemias, lymphomas, and myelomas. Leukemias , also called liquid tumors , may start in bone marrows and be of either lymphoid or myeloid series. On the other hand, lymphoid cancers are solid tumors where a transformed lymphocyte can create a solid tumor. In myelomas, the transformed cells are fully differentiated plasma cells that may present as scattered or dispersed malignant cells or as a solid mass within the bone marrow. Plasma cells are white blood cells that produce antibodies (immunoglobulins) to help the body fight infection. Most of these are associated with gross chromosomal abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. As a result of these mutations, the abnormal plasma cells begin to divide uncontrollably and make several more plasma cells leading to either the precancerous condition called monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) or multiple cancerous myelomas. MGUS also may develop into multiple myeloma later. These myeloma cells can form tumors in bones called plasmacytomas; it may be a solitary plasmacytoma, several plasmacytomas, or multiple myeloma. If formed outside of the bones, they are called extramedullary plasmacytomas.\n\n【15】Common risk factors for multiple myeloma include a weakened immune system, a family history of multiple myeloma, and being overweight. Since plasma cells produce antibodies that help fight infection, the high build-up of abnormal plasma cells causes the production of abnormal antibodies, causing decreased ability to fight infection. Plasma cells also affect other cell lines and may cause a build-up of abnormal blood cells, affecting the functioning of other blood cells and causing symptoms like anemia, fatigue, etc. The increased number of myeloma cells can also distort the balance of certain minerals in the body leading to other symptoms. The myeloma cells can also lead to bone damage and high calcium levels in the blood because of their abnormal proteins called M-protein. These abnormal proteins can also affect other organs, such as the kidneys.\n\n【16】Multiple myeloma may or may not have the symptoms of the disease. Smoldering (indolent) multiple myeloma is when there are no symptoms. This is a transitioning stage between MGUS and the active multiple myeloma with symptoms. People with smoldering multiple myeloma have at least one of the following features: Plasma cells make up 10% or more of the blood cells in the bone marrow or the plasma M-protein level of 30 g/L or more 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Active multiple myeloma or multiple myeloma with symptoms may have M-protein in the blood or urine. Plasma cells make up 10% or more of the blood cells in the bone marrow. A plasmacytoma in the bone or soft tissue. It may also present anemia, kidney failure, or high blood calcium (hypercalcemia). Osteolytic lesions made by abnormal plasma cells can also be seen on X-rays. Light-chain myeloma is another type of myeloma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】Myeloma is diagnosed by physical examination, blood tests, urine tests, a bone marrow biopsy, X-rays, and other more specialized bone imaging tests. An atypical manifestation of the absence of M-protein with nonspecific symptoms may lead to the misdiagnosis. It could put an even greater challenge on the diagnosis and subsequently cause a delay in treatment.\n\n【19】A review conducted by Mayo Clinic revealed the most common presentations of multiple myeloma and the percentage of their presence. Anemia was found to be 73%, bone pain 58%, elevated creatinine (48%), fatigue (32%), hypercalcemia (28%), and weight loss (24%). The International Myeloma Working Group 2 suggested the acronym “ CRAB ” for hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia, and bone lesions to diagnose multiple myeloma. However, up to 20% of patients may have none of these “CRAB” features as their presenting symptoms. They may have atypical symptoms like hyperviscosity syndrome, amyloidosis, hemorrhage, coagulopathy, etc. In such patients, diagnostic challenges may lead to misdiagnosis and potentially serious consequences because of malaligned management plans 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Bone pain, the commonest symptom involving the smaller joints, can mimic rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, diagnosing the condition early will help start the treatment early and prevent serious outcomes of the disease.\n\n【20】Clinical Case Presentation\n--------------------------\n\n【21】A 58-year-old male presented to his physician with arthralgia of the hands, wrists, and elbow. His symptoms started 6 months ago and have gradually worsened since then. He had difficulty making fists and had swelling of his hands and wrists. He also had morning stiffness lasting more than 30 min. He had no history of fevers, chills, weight loss, decreased appetite, or night sweats. Systemic examination was negative for alopecia, dry eyes, mouth sores, and skin rash. The patient had no travel history, history of tick bites, or sick contacts. He was a nonsmoker with occasional consumption of alcohol . The patient was diagnosed previously with osteoarthritis as well. He also had a surgical history of bilateral shoulder replacement for severe osteoarthritis, right-sided carpal tunnel repair, and laminectomy of the cervical and lumbar spine. There was no lymphadenopathy, and no bruises were observed. The musculoskeletal exam showed bilaterally swollen, warm, and tender wrists with synovitis of the second to fifth metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal regions. He also had 30-degree fixed contractures of the elbow. No signs of psoriasis or nail changes were observed.\n\n【22】On lab investigations, white blood cells were found to be 12,000/mm; hemoglobin was 9.7 g/dl, and hematocrit was 30.9%. His C-reactive protein (CRP) was 40 mg per liter (reference = less than 8), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 50 mm per hour (reference range = 0–15). His liver function tests, calcium, thyroid functions, uric acid, renal function, and urinalysis were normal as well, along with normal levels of the antinuclear antibody (ANA) , rheumatoid factor (RF) , anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies , and angiotensin-converting enzyme , hepatitis B panel , and hepatitis C antibody level.\n\n【23】The patient was previously treated with analgesics by his physician and was also seen by a rheumatologist. He was initially treated with prednisone 20 mg/day and methotrexate and then 20 mg/week for 3 months with no response. He was then started on antitumor necrosis factor inhibitors. During his follow-up visit after 6 months, he showed the same symptoms. Alternate TNF inhibitors were started with no improvement as well. X-rays of the joints were done, which showed mild degenerative changes only. An MRI of the right hand was done, which showed synovial thickening of radiocarpal joint and MCP joints with flexor tendon tenosynovitis consistent with inflammatory arthropathy. He also revealed a family history of primary amyloidosis in his mother.\n\n【24】Since his serum calcium, uric acid, and creatinine remained normal during RA treatment, protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and urine protein electrophoresis were sent. The serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) was positive for M-band. The patient was referred to a hematologist for further evaluation and underwent a bone marrow biopsy. His biopsy showed more than 40% plasma cells, which were Congo red stain negative. These findings were consistent with MM. FISH analysis was positive for monosomy 13 in 88% of the cells. Ultimately a diagnosis of multiple myeloma was made, and he was then started on bortezomib and dexamethasone. A 6-month follow-up showed complete resolution of joint swelling; there was a significant improvement in pain in the hands, wrists, and elbows. His MM remained controlled with chemotherapy, and a bone marrow transplant was not needed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】Differential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【26】Multiple myeloma is commonly misdiagnosed with other conditions before reaching the final diagnosis. These conditions include:\n\n【27】1.  1.\n    Arthritis : Arthritis can be of different types, and almost all types present with joint pain, stiffness, swelling, and decreased range of motion. Since multiple myeloma also causes similar symptoms and may cause back pain and stiffness, it can easily be misdiagnosed as arthritis.\n2.  2.\n    Back injury : Any injury to the back may cause localized back pain and stiffness confusing it with multiple myeloma.\n3.  3.\n    Pneumonia : Multiple myeloma may present with fever, frequent infections, backache, and bone pain, including in the chest which may mimic pneumonia. Therefore, a careful history and thorough exam are needed.\n4.  4.\n    Kidney disease : Kidney damage can result from multiple myeloma because of M-protein . However, kidney damage caused by other medical conditions may present similar conditions to multiple myeloma-related kidney damage, like fatigue, lack of appetite, and painful, swollen feet. Frequent urination may distinguish between kidney damage due to chronic kidney disease and multiple myeloma-related kidney injuries.\n5.  5.\n    Amyloidosis : Amyloidosis is the accumulation of amyloid in different body tissues like skin, heart, nerves, etc. Amyloid of various types, “light-chain immunoglobulins,” is one of the types and is associated with the disease “light-chain amyloidosis.” This amyloidosis is called “primary amyloidosis.” This is similar to multiple myeloma, where light-chain immunoglobulins are produced and can easily misdiagnose the condition.\n6.  6.\n    Lyme disease : Lyme disease is a vector-borne disease transmitted by a tick bite and may present with symptoms like fever, joint pains, rash, numbness of hands and feet, fatigue, and headache. Multiple myeloma can present with these symptoms and, therefore, can easily be mistaken for Lyme disease; therefore, a careful history of tick bites should be asked to rule it out.\n7.  7.\n    Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) : Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance is asymptomatic but has the monoclonal protein in the blood, which may cause a misdiagnosis. It doesn’t affect the well-being of the patient.\n8.  8.\n    Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia : This is the malignancy of B-cell lymphocytes producing a monoclonal immunoglobulin. These B-lymphocytes replace the normal bone marrow cells and affect their normal functioning causing anemia and other blood cell deficiency. The large monoclonal IgM monoclonal protein is called macroglobulin. This antibody makes it very similar to multiple myeloma.\n9.  9.\n    Solitary plasmacytoma : A discrete, solitary mass of plasma cells produces antibodies and may occur in different places or organs. If present in bone, it is called solitary bone plasmacytoma and may present with bone pain or fractures like multiple myeloma. It needs regular follow-up as it may progress to multiple myeloma over the years.\n10.  10.\n    POEMS syndrome: POEMS syndrome is a paraneoplastic syndrome and an uncommon marrow disorder. It occurs because of the body’s immune response to cancer, like glomeruloid hemangiomas. It is called POEMS syndrome because of its characteristics, signs, and symptoms: peripheral neuropathy, organ enlargement, endocrine gland dysfunction, monoclonal plasma cell tumors, monoclonal immunoglobulin, and skin changes. Peripheral neuropathy and bone alterations are the reasons for misdiagnosing multiple myeloma as POEMS syndrome. The bone alterations are, however, different from the classic bone changes in multiple myeloma.\n11.  11.\n    Metastatic carcinoma : Any other carcinomas, if metastasized to bones, cause weakened bones and bone pain. If not thoroughly investigated, symptoms may misdiagnose multiple myeloma and miss the primary tumor.\n\n【28】What Was Misdiagnosed in the Case and Why?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【29】The patient presented with symptoms common to rheumatic diseases , like rheumatoid arthritis, and had a history of osteoporosis. He also had contractures of his elbow joint, which misled the physicians that the disease was rheumatological. Another factor leading to misdiagnosis was an overreliance on previously normal findings and a narrow diagnostic focus. However, protein electrophoresis and urine protein electrophoresis were ultimately sent, leading to the diagnosis.\n\n【30】Discussion\n----------\n\n【31】Plasmacytomas form in the bones and lead to bone pain and other symptoms common to several rheumatological diseases . At times, the symptoms are so similar to common rheumatological conditions that an early diagnosis of those diseases is made, and treatment for them is started. However, this prevents the physicians from considering an alternative diagnosis and conducting further tests. A review focusing on such presentations showed that hands and wrists were the most commonly involved joints in patients of MM that mimics rheumatoid arthritis. However, most of these patients had negative rheumatoid factor (RF). This case shows an atypical presentation of MM that mimicked rheumatoid arthritis and consequently misled the physicians into diagnosing it as rheumatoid arthritis and treating it as that. This misdiagnosis caused a delay in diagnosing a cancerous condition, a life-threatening malignancy, and hence delay in its treatment. This highlights an important point of reconsidering and re-evaluating the initial diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis if the patient is not responding to the treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【32】Many patients do not have the well-known risk factors for multiple myeloma. One of these risk factors includes old age, as most individuals diagnosed with the condition are in their 60s. However, some patients present with these symptoms at an early age and therefore need a proper evaluation if present with these symptoms. Family history is another important risk factor of the condition that can be picked up early and prompt early investigation, as the ones having a sibling, parent, or a close relative with multiple myeloma are at increased risk of developing the disease in their lifetime. Males are more commonly diagnosed with multiple myeloma than females, but this gender-based difference is not that stark. Racial differences also tend to play a role in increasing the risk of developing the disease. African Americans are more likely to develop multiple myeloma than Asian Americans. Patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) with more monoclonal protein in the bone marrow and blood are at higher risk.\n\n【33】Shem et al. studied four patients with hematological malignancies mimicking rheumatoid arthritis or other rheumatic conditions. These patients between the ages of 20 years and 62 years presented with rheumatic syndromes and were later diagnosed with hematological malignancies. Two of them were diagnosed with polyarthritis. One of these cases was diagnosed with multiple myeloma and amyloidosis; the other was diagnosed with angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma. The third patient was initially diagnosed with migratory arthritis and then eventually with acute myeloid leukemia. The fourth patient was diagnosed with giant cell arteritis and eventually with anaplastic large cell T-lymphoma. All these patients responded well to corticosteroids given for their initial diagnosis. These cases highlight the importance of considering an alternate diagnosis in the presence of atypical symptoms, even if the corticosteroids show a good response. This may be a major diagnostic pitfall giving a false perception of a correct diagnosis, hence delaying the actual diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【34】Although an overall 5-year survival rate is 54% after the cancer diagnosis, 5% of the multiple myeloma cases diagnosed early have a higher survival rate. Seventy-five percent are alive after 5 years of diagnosis. However, around 95% of the cases are diagnosed at a later stage when cancer has already spread, which reduces the 5-year survival rate from 75% to 53% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Misdiagnosis can delay the diagnosis and increase the mortality rate significantly, highlighting the importance of vigilant investigation and working up these symptoms.",

        "text": "【0】Case Files™ Neurology, Second Edition    \n\n【1】### CASE 24\n\n【2】A 24-year-old graduate student was studying late at night for an examination. As he looked at his textbook, he realized that his left arm and left leg were numb. He dismissed the complaint, recalling that 6 or 7 months ago he had similar symptoms. He rose from his desk and noticed that he had poor balance. He queried whether his vision was blurred, and remembered that he had some blurred vision approximately 1 to 2 years earlier, but that this resolved. He had not seen a physician for any of these previous symptoms. He went to bed and decided that he would seek medical consultation the next day.\n\n【3】 What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【4】 What is the next diagnostic step?\n\n【5】 What is the next step in therapy?\n\n【6】### APPROACH TO: Multiple Sclerosis\n\n【7】#### DEFINITIONS\n\n【8】MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS : MS is a chronic disease, usually beginning in young adults, characterized by relapsing, remitting, or progressive neurologic deficits. These deficits reflect lesions in scattered areas of the central nervous system that appear and can resolve over time.\n\n【9】#### CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【10】##### Epidemiology\n\n【11】MS is the most common cause of neurologic disability in young adults, affecting over 1 million individuals worldwide. There are between 250,000 and 500,000 patients with MS in the United States. MS is more common in northern climates in Europe and the United States, with a prevalence of approximately 1 per 1000 people in these areas. It is more common in women than men by a ratio of 2:1, with a peak incidence of 24 years. Symptoms usually begin between the ages of 10 and 60 years. Onset of symptoms outside this range should cause suspicion of disease other than MS. Seventy percent of patients with MS develop their symptoms between ages 21 and 40 years; 12% develop symptoms between ages 16 and 20; 13% develop symptoms between ages 41 and 50.\n\n【12】Research studies reveal that the risk of MS is increased in individuals born or living in temperate zones, but that people born or migrating to low-risk areas (ie, non temperate zones) prior to 15 years of age have decreased risk. This suggests that exposure to some factor prior to age 15 is important in the genesis of MS. Migration, ethnic, and twin studies suggest that MS is related to genetic as well as environmental factors. If one member of an identical twin pair has MS, there is a 30% chance the other twin will have MS. Siblings of MS patients have a 2.6% risk of MS, parents 1.8%, and children 1.5%.\n\n【13】##### Etiopathogenesis\n\n【14】MS is restricted to the CNS and spares the peripheral nervous system from injury. The pathologic hallmark of MS is focal demyelination within the brain and spinal cord. In MS, discrete areas of damaged myelin, termed plaques, are embedded within normal-appearing tissue. Within each plaque, damaged myelin is associated with inflammatory infiltrates of lymphocytes and macrophages, antibody and complement deposition, activated microglia, and oligodendroglial cell loss. Because of this pathologic association with inflammation and demyelination, MS is considered an autoimmune disease. It is not known whether the immune response observed in MS plaques is a primary process or secondarily caused by other etiologies, such as infectious, toxic, or metabolic injury. The resulting demyelination and subsequent degeneration of axons account for the disability of patients with MS. Early investigations indicated that disease progression was driven by CD4+ effecter cells infiltrating the blood–brain barrier and expressing proinflammatory cytokines that help to activate microglia and other immune cells. New areas of research in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (the experimental model of MS) and human MS have identified previously unknown contributions to diseases pathogenesis, including interleukin-17 producing T helper 17 cells, B cells, CD8+ T cells, and both CD4+ and CD8+ T-regulatory cells. Research into the respective mechanisms of action of these cells has identified novel therapeutic targets to combat this devastating disease.\n\n【15】#### CLINICAL COURSE\n\n【16】There are different clinical patterns or types of MS:\n\n【17】1\\. Benign, comprising approximately 20% of cases , is the least severe type of MS. It includes a few, mild early attacks with complete clearing of symptoms. There is minimal or no disability in this condition.\n\n【18】2\\. Relapsing–remitting MS, accounting for approximately 25% of cases , is characterized by sudden onset (over hours or days) of neurologic symptoms that usually last several weeks and then resolve, often leaving few or no deficits. The frequencies of these relapses are highly variable but averages about one in every 2 years. Some degree of disability is usually present.\n\n【19】3\\. Secondary progressive, comprising approximately 40% of diagnosed cases , is characterized by an initial relapsing–remitting course followed by increasing attacks, with fewer and less complete remissions after each attack. The MS can continue to worsen for many years and then level off with moderate-to-severe disability.\n\n【20】4\\. Primary progressive, accounting for approximately 15% of cases , is the most disabling form of MS. The onset is quite severe, and the course is slowly progressive without any clearing of symptoms. Fortunately, it is the least common of the types of MS.\n\n【21】5\\. Progressive relapsing is rare and is characterized by progressive disease punctuated by acute relapses.\n\n【22】6\\. Clinically isolated syndrome is characterized by the first demyelinating event that is suggestive of MS. It places the patient at risk for further relapses. Some patients will go on to develop relapsing–remitting MS and suffer from multiple attacks, whereas others will have no further evidence of demyelinating disease. It is difficult to predict whether a given individual will develop MS following symptom onset; however, natural history studies show that risk of having a second attack after 14 years of follow-up is 88% if any lesions are present on the initial brain MRI and only 19% if the brain MRI is normal.\n\n【23】##### Clinical Features\n\n【24】The onset of MS symptoms usually occurs over several days and is seldom sudden. The initial symptoms often relate to motor dysfunction. Patients may complain of weakness in the legs and, less commonly, their arms. They may also complain of limb or foot drop, causing difficulty walking, or causing them to trip on sidewalks or curbs. Weakness and stiffness in MS can reflect compromise of the corticospinal tract, which can occur in 30% to 40% of the initial attacks of MS patients and is present in 60% of MS patients with chronic symptoms.\n\n【25】MS patients can also have sensory symptoms, such as tingling, pins and needle sensations, numbness, or a sensation of a band around the torso. Fifty to seventy percent of MS patients will have sensory complaints some time during their illness. Patients can also have cerebellar symptoms. Fifty percent of MS patients have cerebellar signs sometime during the course of their illness. These patients can have limb tremor, ataxia, scanning speech (ie, cerebellar dysarthria), and titubation of the head or trunk. Charcot’s triad, consisting of intention tremor, dysarthria, and nystagmus, is a well-recognized syndrome in MS but occurs rarely.\n\n【26】Optic neuritis and retrobulbar neuritis , both of which can cause blurred vision, scotomas, and decreased color perception, can also occur in MS. Optic neuritis is the presenting symptom in 14% to 23% of patients with MS. Diplopia, exhibited in 12% to 22% of patients, is generally a result of brainstem compromise. Trigeminal neuralgia, also caused by brainstem compromise, is characterized by very brief, severe, lancinating maxillary or mandibular pains, and occurs in 1% of MS patients. Trigeminal neuralgia can be due to causes other than MS, but when these symptoms occur in a young adult, MS should be highly suspected.\n\n【27】Another brainstem-related symptom is facial myokymia , a wormlike movement of muscles that the patient feels but is difficult for an observer to see. This frequently involves the orbicularis oculi muscles. Vertigo occurs in 14% of MS patients and can be associated with diplopia, also caused by brainstem compromise.\n\n【28】Patients with MS may complain of sensations of electricity running down their spine, sometimes extending into the limbs (Lhermitte sign). This symptom is often aggravated by flexing the cervical spine and should raise suspicion of MS or other compromise of the upper cervical spinal cord. Mood disorders, including depression, bipolar illness, and dysphoria occur in one-third to one-half of MS patients. There is disagreement whether these emotional/behavioral disturbances reflect the primary process of MS or the patient’s reaction to his or her disease, or both. Regardless, these symptoms need to be addressed and appropriately treated. MS patients can experience sudden and transient neurologic deterioration if their body temperature is elevated. This can occur with fever, increased physical exertion, or taking a hot bath.\n\n【29】#### DIAGNOSIS\n\n【30】The criteria for diagnosing MS is constantly changing, in part because of increasingly sophisticated brain imaging and immunologic investigations. Although the diagnosis of MS relies on recognition of clinical pattern of disease, several laboratory studies are useful in confirming the diagnosis. Briefly, if a patient has symptoms reflecting two or more separate brain lesions over time, and this is confirmed on MRI brain imaging, MS should be suspected. MRI imaging of the brain and spinal cord, especially with gadolinium infusion, helps to diagnose MS. The brain MRI is abnormal in 95% to 99% of cases of Relapsing/Remitting MS. Typical MS lesions are bright lesions on T2-weighted imaging, especially in the corpus callosum and periventricular regions 删除33：<u></u>. These lesions are usually linear or ovoid and at right angles to the ventricular surface, which are named Dawson fingers after the Scottish pathologist who described similar findings at autopsy. MRI brain lesions larger than 5 mm or lesions inferior to the tentorium, especially in the cerebellar peduncle, help confirm the diagnosis of MS.\n\n【31】通用删除2(英):<u>删除3：<u>Figure 24–1 . T2-weighted MRI brain in multiple sclerosis. 删除10：<u>( Reproduced, with permission, from Kasper DL, et al . Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, 16th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Publishers, 2004:2465 .)</u></u></u>\n\n【32】T1-weighted images are usually less sensitive in detecting demyelinating plaques than are T2-weighted images. Newer techniques of brain imaging, such as fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) provide increased sensitivity and specificity for MS white matter lesions. FLAIR images detect two to three times the number of lesions observed on T2-weighed images. N-acetylaspartate (NAA) also assists in detecting MS lesions. NAA, a marker for neuronal and axonal function, can be measured by magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy. NAA levels are decreased in MS plaques and can also be decreased in seemingly unaffected areas of white matter, suggesting axonal damage.\n\n【33】Analysis of CSF also helps in diagnosing MS . In cases where the MRI is normal or shows a pattern that is consistent with other disease processes, such as microvascular ischemia or infection, CSF analysis is indicated. CSF is abnormal in 85% to 90% of patients with MS. Elevated IgG index, presence of two or more oligoclonal bands, and increased myelin basic protein support the diagnosis. Oligoclonal bands occur in more than 90% of patients with MS, but they also occur in 30% of CNS inflammatory and infectious disease patients, and in 5% to 10% of other noninflammatory neurologic diseases. Presence of oligoclonal bands in CSF or increased IgG synthesis rate is not specific for MS and by themselves do not diagnose MS. MS is a clinical diagnosis that can be supported by brain imaging and CSF investigations. Increased CSF white cells can be seen in MS; however, CSF leukocyte counts greater than 50 mm <sup class=\"calibre11\">3 </sup> of CSF are rare in MS and should prompt the physician to consider other diagnoses.\n\n【34】Electrophysiological studies of the visual pathways and spinal cord dorsal columns are sometimes useful in documenting involvement of these pathways when imaging studies or physical findings do not support the clinical impression. Visual-evoked responses, in which a patient views repeated reversal of light and dark checkerboard stimuli while a computer averages scalp electrode potentials, is useful in evaluating patients for MS. Prolongation of the P100 wave occurs in more than 75% of MS patients. This disturbance reflects compromise of the pathway between the optic nerve and the brain.\n\n【35】The differential diagnosis of MS is broad . Many different conditions can mimic MS because of primary or secondary demyelination of CNS pathways. However, the clinical history, physical examination, and diagnostic studies are fundamental in distinguishing these conditions from MS.\n删除4：<u>Table 24–1 • DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS</u>\n\n【36】#### TREATMENT\n\n【37】Treatment of patients with MS needs to be individualized for each specific patient, depending on particular problems and needs. The treatment should be focused on the disease itself and on associated symptoms.\n\n【38】The primary treatment can consist of intravenous steroids , primarily employed during acute attacks. Steroids have not been shown to decrease the risk of future attacks , or change the natural history of disease, but are indicated to hasten recovery from the acute attack. Immunomodulating agents or disease-modifying therapies can be used to modify the course of MS, and thus are used on a chronic, ongoing basis. These include interferon β-1a (Avonex, Rebif), interferon β-1b (Betaseron), a synthetic polypeptide of myelin basic protein, glatiramer acetate (Copaxone), monoclonal antibody Natalizumab (Tysabri) , which prevents autoreactive T-cells from crossing the blood–brain barrier, and Gilenya (Fingolimod) , a structural analogue of sphingosine, which targets receptors for sphingosine-1-phosphate and hinder the migration of lymphocytes from secondary lymphoid organs to the periphery.\n\n【39】Interferons may work by altering T cells and sealing the blood–brain barrier against their entry into the CNS while Copaxone may prevent activation and differentiation of myelin-targeting T cells. Interferons are injected subcutaneously or intramuscularly and are usually well tolerated. Common side effects include flu-like symptoms and injection-site reactions. Copaxone is injected subcutaneously and side effects include a lump at the injection site, fever, chills, and aches, which subside within 30 minutes. Tysabri is administered intravenously every 28 days. The most serious adverse effect reported with Tysabri is an opportunistic viral infection causing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML).\n\n【40】Fingolimod is the first oral disease-modifying drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for selected patients with highly active, relapsing–remitting MS. In limited clinical trials, Fingolimod was generally safe and well tolerated. However, further clinical experience is required to fully determine the long-term safety profile of fingolimod, particularly with regard to any potentially serious or life-threatening adverse events.\n\n【41】These agents can impact the relapse rate, slow progression of disability and prevent the accumulation or burden of MRI lesions. Moreover, two formulations of interferon-beta delayed conversion into clinically definite MS in patients with clinically isolated syndromes suggestive of MS. Since axonal damage leading to irreversible neurologic disability is already present early at the onset of the disease, immunomodulatory therapy should start as soon as possible.\n\n【42】Vitamin D insufficiency has been shown to be associated with increased susceptibility to MS, but until recently, it was unclear if vitamin D status also influences the prognosis of the disease. In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a mouse model of MS, the administration of vitamin D reduces the severity of the disease. More recently, studies of pediatric-onset and adult MS have demonstrated that among those with established MS, those with lower vitamin D levels are at higher risk for subsequent relapse. These observational data provide strong support for randomized controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation in MS.\n\n【43】Intravenous Mitoxantrone (Novantrone) , an antineoplastic immunomodulatory agent, also has been shown to improve neurologic disability and delayed progression of MS in patients with worsening relapsing–remitting or secondary progressive disease; however, its therapeutic role has been limited due to its cardiotoxicity and myelosuppressive effect. Other immunosuppressive agents, including cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, rituximab and cyclosporine, have been shown to be of clinical benefit in patients with worsening disease.\n\n【44】##### Symptomatic Therapy\n\n【45】Symptomatic therapy for MS can include physical and emotional rest, physical therapy, amantadine, or modafinil for fatigue, anticholinergic medication for bladder dysfunction, baclofen or tizanidine for spasticity, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for mood disorders, and clonazepam or valproic acid for cerebellar tremor.\n\n【46】####",

Although sometimes referred to as an OCD subtype by itself, or grouped as a symptom dimension along with sexual and aggressive obsessions 删除10：<u>(e.g. Abramowitz et al. 2003 ; Pinto et al. 2007 )</u>, scrupulosity can actually take the form of any OCD subtype. For example, a scrupulous individual might fear contamination and engage in decontamination rituals, all with a religious theme, such as excessive cleaning after using the bathroom before prayers. Another individual might have sexual obsessions, with the fear that the thoughts are sinful or blasphemous. Yet another might obsess about accidental errors and engage in repeating or checking rituals, again with a religious fear, such as an individual who reconfesses or checks that religious ritual objects are used or aligned properly. Therefore, scrupulosity is best characterized as a category of core fear that can be associated with any OCD symptom subtype.\n\n【13】Obsessional themes vary by culture 删除10：<u>(e.g. Okasha et al. 1994 ; Rasmussen and Tsuang 1986 )</u>, and religious symptoms are more common in more religious cultures and subcultures. In Western cultures, 10–33 % of individuals with OCD have religious symptoms 删除10：<u>(Eisen et al. 1999 ; Mataix-Cols et al. 2002 )</u>, and 5–6 % have primary scrupulosity 删除10：<u>(Foa and Kozak 1995 ; Tolin et al. 2001 )</u>. However, in some Middle Eastern countries, 40–60 % of those with OCD report religious obsessions 删除10：<u>(for a review, see Greenberg and Huppert 2010 )</u>. Similarly, members of religious subcultures with OCD are more likely to have religious symptoms than are those in the greater culture 删除10：<u>(e.g. Greenberg and Shefler 2002 )</u>. There is no evidence that religion confers a risk for OCD; rather, religious individuals with OCD are likely to experience religious symptoms. Ironically, the large majority of scrupulous individuals experience their symptoms as interfering with their religious practice or relationship with God 删除10：<u>(Siev et al. 2011 )</u>, even though those symptoms are often motivated by the desire to fulfill religious requirements or avoid sin or offending God.\n\n【14】In some studies, the presence of religious obsessions predicts poor treatment outcome for behavioral and pharmacological treatments 删除10：<u>(e.g. Alonso et al. 2001 ; Ferrão et al. 2006 ; Mataix-Cols et al. 2002 ; Rufer et al. 2005 )</u>. In others, however, they do not 删除10：<u>(e.g. Abramowitz et al. 2003 )</u>. Nevertheless, clinicians encounter several difficulties implementing effective exposure and response prevention (ERP) with scrupulous patients. Patients may hesitate more with moral than physical risks, and moral fears are often less easily disconfirmed than are physical ones. Moreover, clergy and co-religionists may reinforce and even encourage compulsions, mistaking them for piety 删除10：<u>(Huppert and Siev 2010 )</u>. Indeed, clergy members of certain denominations and holding certain beliefs may be more likely than others to offer recommendations that are incompatible with ERP and potentially confusing to a scrupulous patient 删除10：<u>(Deacon et al. 2013 )</u>. Patients may perceive their symptoms as religious rather than psychological or psychiatric and doubt the authority of therapists in this domain 删除10：<u>(Ciarrocchi 1995 ; Greenberg and Shefler 2008 )</u>. Therapists are challenged to disentangle religious from compulsive ritual and help patients violate the latter but not the former, which often involves becoming acquainted with unfamiliar and complex religious norms and working collaboratively with clergy. Taken together, effective ERP requires skilled psychotherapy technique and creativity along with cultural sensitivity and respect of patient values.\n\n【15】Several papers and books describe modifications of ERP for scrupulosity in general and for use with specific religious populations 删除10：<u>(e.g. Abramowitz 2001 ; Bonchek 2009 ; Bonchek and Greenberg 2009 ; Ciarrocchi 1995 ; Deacon and Nelson 2008 ; Huppert and Siev 2010 ; Huppert et al. 2007 )</u>. Many religions have existing literatures on the nature and religious response to scrupulosity, often consistent with an ERP approach. Authors of clinical treatment guides and case studies typically encourage therapists to integrate these sources into treatment or incorporate them in psychoeducation and motivational phases. For example, Ciarrocchi 通用删除7(英):<u>( 1995 )</u> describes the writings of John Bunyan and Saint Ignatius Loyola about their own scrupulosity, Greenberg and Shefler 通用删除7(英):<u>( 2008 )</u> review Ultra-Orthodox Jewish responses to scrupulosity in the rabbinic literature, and Besiroglu et al. 通用删除7(英):<u>( 2014 )</u> offer Islamic sources consistent with ERP.\n\n【16】Although secular moral scrupulosity is not uncommon 删除10：<u>(e.g. Siev et al. 2011 )</u>, we focus this chapter on a case that illustrates the application of ERP to an individual with religious scrupulosity. In accordance with American Psychological Association (APA) ethical standards, we have altered case information sufficiently to protect the individual’s confidentiality without sacrificing the clinical utility of the case presentation.\n\n【17】Case Study\n----------\n\n【18】### Presenting Problem\n\n【19】David is a 42-year-old Ultra-Orthodox Jewish man, who was referred by his father for OCD treatment. David reported OCD symptoms related to prayer, ritual purity, and charitable donations. He obsessed about not fulfilling his prayer requirements by making a mistake, not enunciating the words properly, or not having proper concentration. As a result, David ritualized by repeating prayers and saying them excessively slowly. Although these concerns were triggered throughout the day (e.g. when reciting blessings over food), they were particularly prominent mornings and evenings when reciting the cardinal prayer, the Shema, the obligation for which is considered most serious and requires concentration. Moreover, when saying a prayer on behalf of a group, David often repeated the prayer to ensure that others heard every word completely and accurately.\n\n【20】In addition, Orthodox Jewish men wear phylacteries ( tefillin, small black boxes containing biblical passages that are fastened and wrapped with leather straps) during morning prayers on the arm and head, where they are supposed to be placed precisely at the hairline and aligned between the eyes. Tefillin are mentioned in the Shema prayer, and the Talmud (Berachot 14b) alleges that one who recites the prayer without tefillin bears false witness. David obsessed about his tefillin being accidentally misaligned, causing him not to fulfill the obligation to don them and also to bear false witness with the prayer. His associated compulsions included checking the alignment of his tefillin (e.g. with a pocket mirror he brought to synagogue for this purpose) as well as repeating prayers when he adjusted them.\n\n【21】David also obsessed about being ritually impure. Upon awakening, one is required to wash one’s hands by pouring water alternately over them (usually three times on each hand). A similar ritual is completed after touching ritually unclean surfaces (e.g. areas of the body normally covered, shoes, etc.) or using the bathroom, before one can recite prayers or passages from the Bible. David obsessed about accidentally becoming ritually impure and compulsively washed and wiped his hands before and even during prayers, and he even washed his shoes after using the bathroom. He also worried that he had not wiped himself sufficiently after using the bathroom, leading to excessive, repetitive, and time-consuming wiping. David was a full-time Talmudic student and scholar, and he was constantly involved with Bible study. Therefore, obsessional doubts about ritual purity were present throughout most of the day.\n\n【22】In addition to physical purity, David was also concerned about spiritual purity. He obsessed that inappropriate thoughts could make his prayers ineffective or invalid. These potentially blasphemous thoughts included that maybe Christianity was the true religion or that maybe the last generation’s greatest Torah scholar was actually God. Although David believed that these thoughts were absurd and untrue, they intruded in his mind during prayers and distressed him greatly. Consequently, he avoided looking at anything that could be perceived as a cross, including the lowercase letter “t.” He would always either alter the letter or write it in capitals. In order to deal with his obsessional concerns, David would spend hours daily looking up in Jewish legal texts to check whether he was sinning, engaging in discussions with other scholars, or seeking answers from rabbis.\n\n【23】Finally, David compulsively donated money to charity in amounts that his family could not afford. He had great difficulty refusing beggars or discarding solicitations in the mail without sending money. In the year prior to intake, David donated approximately US$9000, depleting most of their savings. At intake, his wife was aware of this, although he had hidden it from her many months. In addition, David actively solicited and collected charity on behalf of others.\n\n【24】### Background and History\n\n【25】David was raised in America in a traditional, conservative Ultra-Orthodox family, the oldest of six children. His father was a rabbi and teacher in a religious high school, and his mother was a homemaker. David attended single-sex religious schools, where the study of religious texts was primary, and secular studies were limited to the minimal legal requirements. Although many students eventually entered the secular workforce, David aspired from a young age to become a full-time religious scholar and legal expert. Following high school, he studied in a renowned seminary in England for 2 years, after which he moved to Israel to continue his religious studies.\n\n【26】At age 23, David began dating. Prospective matches were arranged, and the couple went on several dates after both families agreed the match seemed suitable. David’s wife was English and from a family similar to his. They were engaged after seven dates and married 3 months later. After marrying at age 24, they remained in Israel where he continued full-time religious studies, and she worked as a teacher in a seminary for post-high-school girls. Although the specifics of this arrangement have changed somewhat over the years, at intake, David continued full-time religious studies, for which he earned a modest stipend, and his wife continued to teach at several institutions to support the family. With the exception of conflict related to OCD symptoms, they both reported satisfaction with their marriage and with this arrangement. They had eight children ranging from 1 to 15 years old.\n\n【27】In retrospect, David reported mild OCD symptoms beginning in his early teens; however, they did not cause significant impairment at the time, and others interpreted them as righteous attempts to ensure completion of religious rituals , rather than signs of OCD rituals. The symptoms worsened in his 20s. For example, extensive and elongated prayer rituals sometimes resulted in him coming late for morning studies, and he began to experience religion as more burdensome than fulfilling. David had been in therapy twice, once focused primarily on analytic dream work and once in unspecified supportive psychotherapy. Both times he terminated within 3 months. Over the course of several years, he had sought council from several rabbis, all of whom opined that he was exceeding appropriate standards and offered reassurance. However, they did not offer specific treatment recommendations, and they often encouraged him to attempt to eliminate anxiety by avoiding situations that triggered obsessions or generally to strengthen his faith in God. For example, one rabbi suggested he avoid making blessings on behalf of others. David’s father urged him to seek ERP for OCD after his wife tearfully reported to him her husband’s excessive charity, and he observed David’s worsening prayer and ritual washing compulsions on a recent visit.\n\n【28】### Assessment and Case Conceptualization\n\n【29】David met criteria for OCD, but denied symptoms of all other disorders during a structured clinical interview covering most Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV-TR 删除10：<u>(American Psychiatric Association 2000 )</u> axis I disorders 删除10：<u>(Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview; Sheehan et al. 1998 )</u>. On the Yale–Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale 删除10：<u>(Y-BOCS; Goodman et al. 1989 )</u>, he initially endorsed mild symptoms and received a Y-BOCS score of 19, largely due to his lack of attempts to control his rituals and the potential anxiety he would feel not completing them. However, it became apparent in the second session that this was a clear underestimation of his actual symptoms due to David minimizing them. David’s wife was requested to attend the second session with him, and she reported that he spent hours daily seeking answers to questions, soliciting charity for others, and washing. Initially, David disagreed that this was a problem or that he took more time than he should, but upon inquiry from the therapist, David agreed that he took much more time in these activities than others around him and that it took away from his Torah studies. In addition, he acknowledged that it was a problem that he had given away his family’s savings. Although the therapist did not readminister the Y-BOCS during the second session, a score of approximately 25 probably more accurately reflected David’s pretreatment severity.\n\n【30】David completed a battery of self-report measures including the revised Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory 删除10：<u>(OCI-R; Foa et al. 2002 )</u>, the Penn Inventory of Scrupulosity 删除10：<u>(PIOS; Abramowitz et al. 2002 )</u>, and the Beck Depression Inventory-II 删除10：<u>(BDI-II; Beck et al. 1996 )</u>. He endorsed contamination, checking, ordering/arranging, and obsessional concerns on the OCI-R, resulting in an elevated total score, as well. He reported high levels of scrupulosity on the PIOS, but suggested to the therapist that this simply indicated his religious devotion and not pathology. He scored a 3 on the BDI-II.\n\n【31】Individuals may fear the same stimulus for many different reasons, so it is crucial to identify the patient’s idiosyncratic, core obsessional fears. For example, using the downward arrow technique 删除10：<u>(Burns 1980 )</u>, the therapist asks about the meaning or cost associated with a fear and then continues to ask about meaning and cost (e.g. “And what would be the worst thing about that?”) until the core fear is evident. David had several core obsessional fears. He was concerned about divine punishment after death, although his image was not of a fire and brimstone hell, but rather losing his share in the afterlife (“the world to come”). Moreover, the very state of living in sin and shirking the yoke of his religious obligation was itself a core fear. He had fears, as well, of intolerable and unceasing negative emotions that would result from his obsessions, were he not to ritualize, such as guilt and shame and thoughts of being a cruel person. Finally, he feared that God would cause him and his family to lose their money and sustenance were he to be stingy and withhold his resources from those in need.\n\n【32】Overall, David’s initial depiction of his own symptoms suggested an individual struggling to understand the interaction of his own religious beliefs and practice with OCD. On the one hand, he was aware that his behavior exceeded community standards and rabbinical advice, was often motivated by anxiety, and interfered with some aspects of his life (e.g. religious and marital). On the other hand, he minimized the symptoms and downplayed the extent to which several apparently religious behaviors were in fact symptoms of OCD. This is a struggle for many scrupulous patients, who may be concerned or unclear about where sincere devotion becomes obsessional fear and where religious ritual becomes compulsion. For these reasons, the therapist incorporates cognitive work to allow the patient to examine moral and religious decision making, as well as motivational work throughout. The staple of treatment remains ERP, with a focus on learning to accept doubt and uncertainty, which always exist but are sometimes particularly difficult for patients to tolerate in religious or moral domains.",

He denies smoking and alcohol use. Family history is notable for his father requiring dialysis at age 50. An older brother recently underwent unilateral nephrectomy to decompress intra-abdominal organs. On examination, the patient appears barrel-chested and has a sitting blood pressure of 135/90 mm Hg. His likely genetic renal pathology is associated with an increased incidence of which of the following?\n\n【1】> (A) Cerebral aneurysm\n\n【2】> (B) Horseshoe kidney\n\n【3】> (C) Macular cherry-red spots\n\n【4】> (D) Potter syndrome\n\n【5】> (E) Pott disease\n\n【6】 Answer: The correct answer is A . Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is associated with berry aneurysms in the circle of Willis and with cyst formation not only in the kidneys but in the liver, pancreas, and spleen. Hypertension is a common early finding, with an average age at onset of 30 years. Later in the course, kidneys can reach sizes triple their normal volumes, often resulting in disabling symptoms due to pressure on intra-abdominal organs. ADPKD does not present at a young age. Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney (ARPKD) disease is diagnosed most often in pediatric patients; it is associated less often with cyst formation in multiple visceral organs and with the formation of berry aneurysms.  \nAnswer B is incorrect . Horseshoe kidney is associated with many renal diseases, but it does not involve the extra-renal findings described in the question.  \nAnswer C is incorrect . Children with inborn errors of metabolism can present with ophthalmologic findings such as cherry-red spots in the macula. An example is Niemann-Pick disease, a lysosomal storage disease in which a sphingomyelinase deficiency results in accumulation of sphingomyelin. The disease is characterized by varying degrees of splenomegaly and neurologic deficits.  \nAnswer D is incorrect . Potter syndrome is a condition involving renal agenesis, and it is not associated with any cystic changes.  \nAnswer E is incorrect . Pott disease is a TB infection of the vertebrae.",

What is the mechanism by which NSAIDs are believed to mediate this harmful effect on the kidney?\n\n【1】> (A) Increased prostaglandin synthesis constricts preglomerular vessels\n\n【2】> (B) Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis decreases glomerular capillary permeability\n\n【3】> (C) Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis decreases preglomerular resistance\n\n【4】> (D) Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis increases preglomerular resistance\n\n【5】> (E) The drug has direct toxic effects on the renal tubules\n\n【6】 Answer: The correct answer is D . Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are cyclooxygenase inhibitors. Because cyclooxygenase catalyzes the initial step in the metabolism of arachidonic acid, NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin and thromboxane production. In healthy people, prostaglandins (which are vasodilators) are secreted at a low basal rate and have little effect on renal perfusion. In patients with states of effective volume depletion such as heart failure and cirrhosis, there is increased secretion of the vasoconstrictors angiotensin II and norepinephrine. In these cases, there is increased secretion of prostaglandins (mostly prostacyclin and prostaglandin E2 ) to maintain renal blood flow by counteracting the vasoconstrictive effects of these hormones at preglomerular vessels (eg, the afferent arteriole). When prostaglandin synthesis is inhibited by NSAIDs in these patients, preglomerular resistance increases and renal blood flow (and thus glomerular filtration rate) is reduced. This ischemia can lead to acute renal failure.  \nAnswer A is incorrect . NSAIDs act to inhibit, not increase, prostaglandin synthesis.  \nAnswer B is incorrect . Prostaglandins act as vasodilators and do not have an effect on glomerular capillary permeability.  \nAnswer C is incorrect . Inhibiting the vasodilatory effects of prostaglandins acts to increase preglomerular resistance, causing renal ischemia.  \nAnswer E is incorrect . Although NSAIDs can also induce acute renal failure by causing an acute interstitial nephritis or minimal change disease, they have not been associated with direct toxic effects on the tubules or acute tubular necrosis.",

The remaining lymph drains to the infraclavicular， supraclavicular， and parasternal (also known as the internal thoracic) nodes. To assess for lymph node metastasis in breast cancer， a sentinel lymph node biopsy is performed. To do this， a dye is injected into the tumor， and the first lymph node that the tumor drains into is dyed first. This lymph node is then biopsied to assess for lymphatic invasion.\n\n【4】Molecular analysis of a biopsy reveals that the cells express c-erbB-2 in high levels.

She under-went a bilateral tubal ligation after the birth of her last child， and a pregnancy test is negative. She has not had a menstrual period for the last 8 months. She complains of intermittent headaches and some difficulty with her peripheral vision.\n\n【1】What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【2】What is the best diagnostic test?\n\n【3】ANSWERS TO CASE 20： PROLACTIN ADENOMA\n\n【4】Summary： A 35-year-old woman has bilateral nipple discharge， headache， and visual abnormalities.\n\n【5】Most likely diagnosis： Prolactin adenoma.\n\n【6】Diagnostic tests： Basal prolactin levels and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pituitary with gadolinium or computed tomography (CT) imaging.\n\n【7】CLINICAL CORRELATION\n\n【8】This 35-year-old woman complains of headache， difficulty with her peripheral vision， amenorrhea， and galactorrhea. This symptom complex is consistent with hyperprolactinemia caused by a prolactin-secreting adenoma. The pitu-itary tumor impinges on the optic chiasm， leading to headache and bitemporal hemianopia. The elevated prolactin level causes milk production in the breast and also inhibits gonadotropin-releasing hormone at the level of the hypothal-amus. Thus， gonadotropin levels fall， and the ovaries become quiescent. The patient is in a hypoestrogenic state. Prolactin levels in this patient probably would demonstrate a marked elevation. Imaging of the sella turcica with MRI probably would show an adenoma. Medical therapy is generally the first option with these tumors.\n\n【9】APPROACHTO ANTERIOR PITUITARY PATHOLOGY\n\n【10】Objectives\n\n【11】Know the most common pituitary adenoma.\n\n【12】● Describe the visual defect associated with a pituitary adenoma.\n\n【13】 Describe the common causes of hyperprolactinemia.\n\n【14】Definitions\n\n【15】Pituitary tumors： Neoplastic growths that are classified by the type of hor-mone they produce and by their size： Microadenomas are less than 1 cm in diameter， and macroadenomas are more than 1 cm in diameter.\n\n【16】Hyperprolactinemia： Increased levels of prolactin (higher than 20 ug/L) caused by a prolactin adenoma， physiologic hyperprolactinemia in preg-nancy， nipple stimulation， damage to the dopaminergic neurons of the hypothalamus， and trauma or drugs blocking dopamine receptors.\n\n【17】Hypopituitarism： Decreased secretion of pituitary hormones ensuing from diseases of the hypothalamus or the pituitary； it can be a congenital or acquired abnormality. Most cases are due to destructive processes such as tumors， ischemic necrosis of the pituitary， and the empty sella syndrome.\n\n【18】DISCUSSION\n\n【19】The pituitary gland is located in the sella turcica at the base of the brain. It is a small gland that measures approximately 1 cm in diameter and weighs approx-imately 0.5 g. The pituitary has two lobes： the anterior lobe， which is derived from the Rathke pouch， and the posterior lobe. Its proximity to the optic chiasm causes the typical visual symptoms (bitemporal hemianopia) 删除33：<u></u>. Histologically， the anterior pituitary contains eosinophilic cells (growth hor-mone and prolactin)， basophilic cells (gonadotropins， adrenocorticotropic hor-mone， melanocyte-stimulating hormone， and thyroid-stimulating hormone) and chromophobic cells. The anterior pituitary hormones， except prolactin， are con-trolled by releasing hormones from the hypothalamus that pass through the hypophyseal portal system. The posterior pituitary or neurohypophysis stores oxytocin and vasopressin， hormones that are made by the hypothalamus. These hormones then are released by exocytosis into the systemic circulation.\n\n【20】Prolactinomas\n\n【21】Prolactinomas are the most common pituitary adenoma， accounting for approximately 30 to 40 percent. They are composed of lactotrophic cells(eosinophilic and chromophobic cells). Even the smallest tumor can secrete enough prolactin for hyperprolactinemia to occur. Prolactinoma causes galac-torrhea and amenorrhea in women， and men may experience decreased libido， impotence， and， rarely， gynecomastia and galactorrhea.\n\n【22】删除3：<u>Figure 20-1. Pituitary adenoma and its relationship to the optic chiasm.</u>\n\n【23】Hyperprolactinemia\n\n【24】Numerousconditions can cause elevation1offtthe prolactinlevel. Hypothyroidism， pregnancy， medications， and pituitary adenomas are the most common causes. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) actsas a prolactin-releasing hormone； its elevation in hypothyroidism is thought to be the mechanism of hyperprolactinemia. Correction of the hypothyroidism usu-ally leads to normalization of the prolactin level. Drugs that may produce a hyperprolactinemic state include neuroleptic drugs (dopamine receptor antag-onists) and reserpine (inhibits dopamine storage). Other causes include estro-gens， renal failure， stress， and herpes zoster of the chest wall.\n\n【25】Hypopituitarism\n\n【26】Ischemic necrosis of the pituitary gland is a significant cause of hypopitu-itarism， causing damage to more than 75 percent of the gland. Infarction of the anterior lobe may be seen in Sheehan syndrome as a result of hemorrhage or shock occurring postpartum. The presenting sign may be inability to lactate， amenorrhea， and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency.\n\n【27】Another cause of hypopituitarism may be pituitary adenomas， by direct destruction or compression of the pituitary or by impaired blood supply result-ing from pituitary stalk compression.\n\n【28】Treatment\n\n【29】As first-line treatment for prolactin-secreting adenomas， bromocriptine or cabergoline (dopamine agonists) should be used， even if the patient exhibits visual disturbances， because it decreases the size of the adenoma 25 to 50 per-cent. Transsphenoidal resection of the adenoma is an alternative treatment.",

He limps  删除换行1 into the Emergency Department several hours later and complains of weakness in his lower  删除换行1 extremities, which came on with the back pain. He also has some pain and numbness down  删除换行1 his legs and on the top of his feet, right worse than left. The pain has not been relieved  删除换行1 by ibuprofen.\n\n【3】Examination\n\n【4】He is unable to walk on his heels. His abdomen is soft, but he has a large palpable mass below  删除换行1 the umbilicus. A rectal exam reveals no active or passive tone.\n\n【5】Investigations\n\n【6】• An MRI of the lumbar spine is shown in Figure 37.1.\n\n【7】Questions\n\n【8】1. What is the diagnosis?\n\n【9】2. What imaging study/studies would you obtain?\n\n【10】3. Where would you expect to find the abnormality/abnormalities?\n\n【11】4. What else would you do?\n\n【12】删除3：<u>Figure 37.1 A sagittal section MRI scan of the lumbar spine.</u>\n\n【13】DISCUSSION\n\n【14】This is a case of cauda equina syndrome (CES). The signs and symptoms of lower extremity  删除换行1 weakness and pain developing acutely after heavy lifting should raise suspicion for a herniated intervertebral disc, which is the commonest cause of CES. Depending on the location  删除换行1 and degree of the herniation, a combination of nerve root and cord could be impinged. In this  删除换行1 case, the patient’s foot drop and numbness in the anterior leg and dorsum of the feet suggest  删除换行1 that the herniated disc was causing an L5 radiculopathy. The spinal cord typically terminates  删除换行1 at the L1/2 level in an adult. Caudal to this, the cord continues as the cauda equina. If the  删除换行1 spinal cord itself is compressed by a herniated disc, myelopathic signs such as hyperreflexia,  删除换行6 Hoffmann’s sign, Babinski’s sign and clonus would be expected.\n\n【15】When the cauda equina is compressed by a very large central disc, patients can present with a  删除换行1 combination of urinary retention, bowel incontinence, loss of anal tone and saddle anaesthesia. These findings are related to the compression of the somatic and autonomic fibres from  删除换行1 nerve roots S2–4, which control the detrussor muscle of the bladder, external and internal  删除换行1 anal sphincters and perineal sensation. The caliber of the spinal canal can also be reduced by  删除换行1 osteophytes and soft tissue such as ligamentum flavum hypertrophy. In these cases, a smaller  删除换行1 degree of herniated nucleus pulposus will produce marked signs and symptoms.\n\n【16】CES is a neurosurgical emergency. The goal is to prevent irreversible loss of bowel and bladder function and motor function of the lower extremities. While CES is primarily a clinical  删除换行1 diagnosis, further imaging will be required to aid decision-making and operative planning.\nUltimately, an MRI of the lumbar spine will help guide the neurosurgeon. In this case, the  删除换行1 large L4/5 disc is seen to compress the cauda equina at this level with loss of CSF signal surrounding the nerve roots. Sagittal and axial T2 sequence images should be inspected to make  删除换行1 this determination. Reproducible examination findings correlating with imaging findings  删除换行1 strengthens the case for CES. A rectal exam to assess passive and active rectal tone as well as  删除换行1 saddle anaesthesia is crucial; further, while urinary incontinence is erroneously thought of as  删除换行1 a classic symptom, urinary retention remains the most common deficit associated with CES.\nA post-void bladder scan to assess residuals is a very helpful means of objectively diagnosing  删除换行1 urinary retention. The timing of onset and duration of each symptom are particularly important to ascertain. A foot drop developing over the last 24 hours is more likely to improve  删除换行1 with urgent decompression than bowel incontinence that has been ongoing for several weeks.\nNevertheless, surgery may still be indicated in the latter case to prevent further deterioration  删除换行1 in other aspects of the patient’s neurological examination, especially if some function is still  删除换行1 preserved.\n\n【17】A multitude of alternative diagnoses may masquerade as CES – stroke, vascular claudication, deep venous thrombosis, muscle cramps and peripheral neuropathy. A good history  删除换行1 and examination will help differentiate these from true CES. If there is a concern for bony  删除换行1 fracture from trauma, a non-contrast CT should be performed. If an unstable fracture is  删除换行1 found on initial CT, spinal precautions should be maintained until definitive management.\nThe scan time is in the order of seconds to minutes and hence will be available for inspection much quicker than an MRI, which can take 30–60 minutes. The lumbar spine is often  删除换行1 scanned in isolation, but consideration should be given to extending the imaging to the thoracic and cervical spine as well as the brain in order to rule out a higher level lesion in cases  删除换行1 where clinical correlation is less than expected.\nCase 37: Back pain at the gym\n\n【18】While awaiting an MRI, a full blood count, electrolytes, coagulation studies and a group  删除换行1 and save should be obtained in anticipation of surgical intervention. Obtained early, any  删除换行1 pertinent abnormalities can be corrected with minimal delay in getting the patient into the  删除换行1 operating theatre.\n\n【19】Key Points\n\n【20】• Obtain a good history to rule out other pathology and always perform a rectal  删除换行1 exam if cauda equine syndrome is suspected.\n\n【21】• Consider scanning the thoracic and cervical spine and/or the brain to rule out a  删除换行1 higher lesion where indicated.\n\n【22】• Always compare with previous imaging if available.删除9：<u>http://taylorandfrancis.com137</u>",

Although significant long-term sequelae are confined to the coronary arteries, multiple other organs and tissues are inflamed during the acute illness and causing clinical symptoms. Likewise, irritability and a culture-negative pleocytosis of the cerebrospinal fluid in infants with prolonged fevers suggest that aseptic meningitis may develop in patients with KD. But it is usually overlooked. Common complications of nervous system in KD children include: aseptic meningitis as the most common one, seizures, temporary hemiplegia, facial paralysis, ataxia, hearing impairment, visual abnormalities, and behavioral abnormalities can also be associated (Alves et al. Rev Assoc Med Bras 57通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u>:299–300, 2011; Poon et al. Hong Kong Med J 6通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u>:224–226, 2000; Knott et al. Am J Otolaryngol 22通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u>:343–348, 2001). Neurological involvement in children with KD may be due to ischemic effects of small vessel inflammation which cause neuritis, ischemia, and increased intracranial pressure. The symptoms of abducens nerve palsy in some children with KD recovered after 2–6 weeks of treatment (Amano and Hazama, Acta Pathol Jpn 30通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u>:365–373, 1980). Histopathological examination of KD nervous system showed edema, necrosis, glial cell hyperplasia, lymphocyte invasion, etc. (Guven et al.

We saw abduction nerve paralysis in one KD patient, and abnormal EEG lasted over 4 months in another patient. In most of the children, neurological impairments were recovered within one month.\n\n【9】3.1 Case 16: KD with Aseptic Meningitis (CSF Cell Count Elevated)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】A previously healthy 4-year-old girl enjoying regular sport fun had no significant past medical and family history.\n\n【11】She presented on Day 7 of illness with remittent fever, along with conjunctiva congestion for 5 days, without chills or convulsions.

        "text": "【0】Clinical Manifestations\n-----------------------\n\n【1】Diagnosis of SS is based on clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings. A proper history from the patient is critical to diagnose and define the etiology of hypopituitarism. The essential diagnostic criteria of SS are (i) history of severe postpartum hemorrhage, (ii) varying degrees of pituitary insufficiency, (iii) a partially or completely empty sella on imaging; nonessential but strongly suggestive criteria are (iv) severe hypotension or shock during index delivery, (v) postpartum amenorrhea, and (vi) failure of postpartum lactation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Loss of growth hormone (GH) secretion is seen in 93–100% of patients and PRL in 71–100% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 \\]</u>. Gonadotropin (follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH)) and thyrotropin (TSH) deficiencies occur in a significant percentage of patients followed by corticotropin (ACTH) deficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 , 25 \\]</u>. Panhypopituitarism is very common in SS, albeit preservation of one or more hormone axes can also be seen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 26 , 27 \\]</u>. The discrepancy in degrees of pituitary dysfunction among different studies may be explained by variable times of diagnostic delay.\n\n【3】Although the great majority of the patients with SS are diagnosed some years after the first event complicated by severe vaginal bleeding, a few patients may be diagnosed acutely just after the delivery, and it may be fatal if the patient remains undiagnosed and untreated. Acute presentation of SS is characterized by headache, loss of consciousness, visual disturbances, failure of lactation, and clinical findings of acute adrenal insufficiency, such as fatigue, nausea, and vomiting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 27 \\]</u>. In contrast to the appearance of an empty sella as a diagnostic finding on pituitary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in chronic cases, acute SS is characterized by a large intrasellar mass with superior extension and enlarged pituitary gland on MRI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 28 \\]</u>. A patient with undiagnosed SS may present with an unremitting headache in the early postpartum period. For this reason, SS should be taken into account in the differential diagnosis of headache developing in the early postpartum period, when associated with agalactia (absence of milk production) in particular 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 29 \\]</u>. One of the first initial warning signs in the acute period of SS may be severe hyponatremia during the postpartum period. Hyponatremia, especially if accompanied by unexplained headache in the postpartum period, should cause suspicion for SS, and hormonal investigations should be performed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 30 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】However, most of the patients have nonspecific symptoms, and unfortunately they are diagnosed years after delivery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 13 , 26 \\]</u>. The diagnostic delay is reported as 7–19 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 13 \\]</u>. If the acute period is clinically silent, then the diagnosis can be missed later in the following period due to insidious findings. One of the reasons for the delay of diagnosis can be slow progression of damage in the pituitary over time which may eventually cause a clinically detectable hypopituitarism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 31 \\]</u>. Sometimes, intervening stress factors such as an infection or a surgery may unmask the findings of a silent adrenal insufficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 32 \\]</u>. As mentioned, the high prevalence of nonspecific symptoms may lead to detect abnormalities which are not related to the pituitary such as very low vitamin D level or macrocytic anemia. Some clinical improvement of the patients after correction of these abnormalities may also delay the diagnosis of SS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. Clinical findings of TSH and ACTH deficiencies and subtle features of GH deficiency are common, but their absence does not rule out SS since 10% of cases may be asymptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 27 \\]</u>. A detailed obstetrical history including the number of births, stillbirths, miscarriages, postpartum bleeding, postpartum agalactia, and amenorrhea from all female patients may help detect almost all cases with SS. This is very commonly ignored in daily clinical practice especially if the patient is of postmenopausal age. Awareness of gynecologists about SS is also critical since some of the patients may be referred due to amenorrhea.\n\n【5】On physical examination, sparse axillary and pubic hair, atrophy of the breast, a typical appearance of looking older than the chronological age, increased fine wrinkling around mouth and eyes, hypopigmentation, dry skin, slowing of reflexes, and bradycardia can be detected. Sometimes acute presentations of adrenal crisis or myxedema coma triggered by infection, surgery, or trauma can be seen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【6】Late presentations of SS may include hyponatremia and related findings such as nausea, vomiting, cognitive changes, and sometimes death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 , 27 , 33 \\]</u>. In a study from Nigeria, hyponatremia was reported in 20% of the patients with SS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 34 \\]</u>. Hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia are other electrolyte abnormalities that also can be seen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 \\]</u>. Hypocortisolemia stimulates arginine vasopressin (AVP) secretion via corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) in addition to the resultant hypotension and decreased cardiac output 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 35 \\]</u>. Inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone was clearly documented in SS patients presenting with hyponatremia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 36 \\]</u>. Hypocortisolemia and hypothyroidism decrease free water clearance independent from AVP. It has been demonstrated that GH and PRL deficiencies can also be associated with hyponatremia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 \\]</u>.\n\n【7】Rarely polyuria and polydipsia due to diabetes insipidus can be seen in SS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Studies regarding posterior pituitary function are limited. In a study including 27 patients with SS and 16 healthy controls, posterior pituitary function was investigated by water deprivation testing and hypertonic saline infusion. None of the patients had frank diabetes insipidus while they were on adequate replacement therapy, and approximately 30% of the patients had partial diabetes insipidus. It was suggested that the thirst center might be affected by ischemic damage and the osmotic threshold for the onset of thirst is increased in SS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. Karaca et al. from the same center confirmed these results and demonstrated that SS is characterized by subtle abnormalities in posterior pituitary functions and that GH replacement therapy has no effect on posterior pituitary functions in SS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 37 \\]</u>. It is not surprising that posterior pituitary functions may be disturbed even if mild in SS, because neurohypophysis and hypothalamic nuclei are affected in over 90% of the patients with postpartum pituitary necrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 38 , 39 \\]</u>.\n\n【8】Clinical symptoms related to hypoglycemia can also be seen as a result of ACTH, TSH, and GH deficiencies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 40 \\]</u>. Although the underlying mechanism is not clear, the patient with SS may present with psychiatric problems including delusions, hallucinations, aggressive behavior, depression and disorientation, fluctuations in cognition, and bradykinesia, and appropriate hormone replacement therapy dramatically improves these manifestations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 41 , 42 \\]</u>. Hypoglycemia, electrolyte abnormalities, and disturbed cognitive function may all play a role in these findings. Delayed recovery after general anesthesia has recently been reported in a patient with SS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 43 \\]</u>.\n\n【9】Hematological abnormalities such as anemia (45–87%), thrombocytopenia (63–105%), pancytopenia (15%), and coagulation disorders are common in patients with SS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 26 , 44 \\]</u>. Anemia is usually normochromic normocytic, but it can also be hypochromic microcytic or rarely macrocytic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 45 \\]</u>. Secondary hypothyroidism, hypocortisolemia, and GH deficiency may affect marrow function and erythropoiesis, which are suggested to be involved in the development of anemia. Pancytopenia associated with bone marrow hypoplasia can be seen. These effects are reversible after replacement of the deficient hormones 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 44 \\]</u>. Factor VIII and von Willebrand factor deficiencies, decreased prothrombin time and activated prothrombin time, and increased fibrinogen and D-dimer levels can be seen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>, although a case of SS with pancytopenia and hypercoagulopathy presenting as myxedema coma has also been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 46 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】The prevalence of osteoporosis is increased in SS when compared with those of age-matched controls 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 47 \\]</u>. In a study from India including 38 patients, low bone mass (bone mineral density (BMD Z-score ≤ −1) and severely low bone mass (BMD Z-score ≤ −2) were reported as 80% and 44%, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 48 \\]</u>. In an Indian study, 58% of patients with SS had osteopenia, and 37% had osteoporosis at the lumbar spine. There was a significant inverse relationship between BMD and duration of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 49 \\]</u>. Chihaoui et al. found osteopenia in 41.7% and osteoporosis in 35.0% of 60 patients with SS. When compared to 60-year-age-, height-, and weight-matched control women, BMD was significantly lower in patients with SS with more common involvement of the lumbar spine. The duration of the disease and the daily dose of hydrocortisone were independently and inversely associated with BMD at the femoral neck 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 50 \\]</u>. de Sa Cavalcante et al. in a case-control study, have found some morphological changes compatible with the possibly a state of reduced BMD in some part of mandibular regions by using a custom computer program in 30 patients with SS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 51 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】A number of factors like gonadal and growth hormone deficiency and others may be involved in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis in SS. In a cross-sectional study, 83 patients with SS were reported to have significantly lower BMD, and 19 of them who were prospectively followed up showed significant improvement in BMD of the lumbar spine, in particular, after a year of estrogen replacement and calcium and vitamin D3 supplementation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 52 \\]</u>. Besides low BMD, SS is associated with lower serum calcium and ALP levels and higher phosphorus and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels when compared to healthy subjects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 53 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】Sheehan syndrome is characterized by severe and long-standing GH deficiency (GHD). We conducted a prospective study in 14 severely GH-deficient patients with SS in order to determine the effects of GH in some clinical, biochemical, anthropometric measurements and BMD before and at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months of the GH replacement. Hormone deficiencies other than GH were appropriately replaced. GH replacement did not cause any significant changes in BMD including the lumbar spine and femur neck 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 54 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】The possible mechanisms responsible for osteoporosis seen in SS may be hypogonadism, inappropriately high dosage of corticosteroid replacement, GHD and disorders of parathyroid hormone, and calcium metabolism. But the contribution of each anterior pituitary hormone deficiency on bone loss should be clarified in further prospective studies.\n\n【14】Diagnosis\n---------\n\n【15】The initial step for the diagnosis of SS is the measurement of basal hormone levels, and stimulation tests may be required when basal hormone levels are borderline.\n\n【16】In most patients, baseline FSH and LH levels are inappropriately low in relation to estradiol levels, and, if performed, LH levels do not increase after stimulation by gonadotropin-releasing hormone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. A basal morning cortisol level of <3 μg/dl or >15–18 μg/dl is compatible with insufficiency and sufficiency of the HPA axis, respectively. However dynamic testing with ACTH stimulation (not in the acute phase) and/or an insulin tolerance test (ITT) or a glucagon stimulation test (GST) can also be used, and the latter two tests also allow interrogation of the GH axis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 55 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Secondary hypothyroidism is characterized by normal, decreased, or slightly increased levels of TSH despite low free T4 levels. TRH stimulation testing, in general, is not required, but failed TSH responses are seen in cases of TSH deficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 56 \\]</u>. In patients with low IGF-1 and at least three accompanying hormone deficiencies it can be consistent with GH deficiency. Otherwise, ITT or GST may help diagnose GH deficiency.\n\n【18】Radiological Findings\n---------------------\n\n【19】Pituitary MRI is the preferred method of radiological imaging in SS. In the acute phase, an enlarged nonhemorrhagic pituitary gland with central infarction can be observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 57 , 58 \\]</u>. The pituitary gland shrinks within several weeks, and further progressive atrophy leads to an empty sella appearance in the following years. Since most cases are diagnosed several years after delivery, patients with SS have a partially (25–30%) or completely (70–75%) empty sella on imaging studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 24 , 59 , 60 \\]</u>. However, the degree of empty sella is not always correlated with the severity of hypopituitarism.\n\n【20】SS can be difficult to differentiate from lymphocytic hypophysitis in the immediate postpartum period since both may lead to hypopituitarism and pituitary enlargement. However, the presence of diabetes insipidus, association with other autoimmune disorders, loss of corticotropic cell function first, and hyperprolactinemia are findings in favor of lymphocytic hypophysitis. History of severe postpartum hemorrhage and failure of postpartum lactation favors a diagnosis of SS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】Management\n----------\n\n【22】The treatment of SS involves replacement of deficient pituitary hormones. Since partial hypopituitarism may show progression, pituitary function should be evaluated at regular intervals. Glucocorticoid replacement in ACTH deficiency, L-thyroxine in TSH deficiency, estrogen and progesterone in hypogonadal premenopausal patients, and GH replacement in selected GH-deficient patients are required.\n\n【23】In acute cases where there is a high suspicion of adrenal insufficiency, glucocorticoid therapy should be initiated promptly after obtaining serum samples for cortisol determination. The adverse effects of glucocorticoid overtreatment should be regularly monitored, and the dose should be adjusted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. The more commonly used glucocorticoid as a replacement are hydrocortisone and prednisone. Dual-release hydrocortisone (a tablet with an immediate-release coating surrounding an extended-release core) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 61 \\]</u> and a continuous subcutaneous hydrocortisone infusion pump are novel treatment options 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 62 \\]</u> which may provide a more physiological replacement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 63 \\]</u>. The dose needs to be increased in cases of stress, and parenteral replacement at stress doses is required during surgery, trauma, and severe infections. It should also be kept in mind that replacement of other hormones such as thyroid hormone or GH may affect the needed glucocorticoid dose 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 63 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】L-thyroxine dose should be titrated according to free T4 levels, for example, to the upper half of the normal range if appropriate, rather than TSH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 56 \\]</u>. GH replacement may increase T4–T3 transformation and increase the need of T4 dose.\n\n【25】In a study including patients from 19 mostly developed countries, GH deficiency has been found more severe when compared to nonfunctional pituitary adenoma patients, and GH replacement therapy was found to improve QoL, cognitive function, dyslipidemia, and body composition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 , 54 , 64 \\]</u>. GH replacement may also have some beneficial effects on the skin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 65 \\]</u> and sympathovagal balance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 66 \\]</u>, but not on sleep 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 67 \\]</u> or BMD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 54 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】In patients with a desire for fertility, ovulation induction can be used, but spontaneous pregnancies may rarely be seen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 68 \\]</u>.\n\n【27】If present, diabetes insipidus can be treated with desmopressin.\n\n【28】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【29】Sheehan syndrome is a rare and, unfortunately, underrecognized condition due to nonspecific symptoms and signs, as in other causes of hypopituitarism. However, a proper obstetrical and postpartum history of each patient will raise the suspicion and identify most. Once suspected, the diagnosis is confirmed with appropriate hormonal investigations and a pituitary MRI, with the typical appearance of an empty sella. Treatment involves replacement of deficient hormones as glucocorticoids, L-thyroxine, and if appropriate estrogen and progesterone and GH in selected patients. More rarely an acute presentation of SS may occur, and prompt diagnosis and treatment with glucocorticoids become vital. Long-term follow-up for an adequate replacement therapy and monitorization of over- or undertreatment are also critical. The awareness of the medical community about SS especially in developed countries should be taken into consideration.",

The rapid onset of vomiting and diarrhea associated with Staphylococcus aureus food poisoning is not due to the bacterium itself but rather to ingestion of pre-formed enterotoxin. Mayonnaise and egg products are common sources.  \nAnswer A is incorrect . Bacillus cereus is a gram-positive, β-hemolytic rod that is often associated with food poisoning from reheated rice. Much like S aureus , it can produce a pre-formed toxin that can result in food poisoning.  \nAnswer B is incorrect . Gram-positive, catalase-positive, coagulase-positive bacteria include S aureus , which is likely the source of the preformed enterotoxin. However, the preformed enterotoxin is responsible for this patient’s symptoms of food poisoning.  \nAnswer D is incorrect . S aureus can also produce the superantigen TSST-1, which mediates toxic shock syndrome. This patient is not exhibiting symptoms of toxic shock syndrome, which include fever, rash, and shock.  \nAnswer E is incorrect . Raw or undercooked seafood is a common cause of Vibrio parahaemolyticus or V vulnificus infection. These pathogens cause disease by direct invasion of the intestinal mucosa. The incubation period from ingestion to illness is about three days; S aureus toxin causes illness within hours of ingestion.",

In the report noted in Table 12.1c， dermato-logic conditions and diarrheal diseases were commonly reported， including insect bites but not respiratory diseases. Because cholera and typhoid are not commonly found in the Gulf States area， it was very unlikely that they would occur after Hurricane Katrina. There was in fact no outbreak of these illnesses. Twenty-four cases of Vibrio illnesses were reported to the CDC， with six deaths 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.

Extreme pain at the involved limb and systemic illness， including shock， can occur. The skin may show peculiar blisters (often hemorrhagic) in association with the cel-lulitis， as was noted in patients 5 (case #12.2) and 6 (case #12.1) reported here删除25：<u></u>.

Rapid death is typical with overwhelming sepsis in those with severe underlying diseases (severe liver disease or other immunosuppression) 删除25：<u></u>.\n\n【6】Serious infections with Vibrio organisms lead to prolonged hospitalization in those who survive， especially with V. vulnificus (patients 5 and 6 spent 22 and41 days， respectively， in the hospital). Multiple surgical debridement， appropriate antibiotics， skin grafting， and， on occasion， HBO therapy may be required (as in patients 1，5， and 6). Those with severe underlying disease arriving in septic shock(e.g. as in patients 3 and 4) have a rapid demise.\n\n【7】Successful treatment requires a combination of antibiotics， surgery， and sep-sis/shock management that should be initiated early in the illness.\n\n【8】Table 12.1c Number of cases of selected diseases and conditions reported in evacuees and rescue workers during the 3 weeks immediately after Hurricane Katrina made landfall- multiple states， August-September 2005.\n\n| Disease/Condition\\  | No. of cases  | States reporting  | Population  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Dermatologic conditions  |  |  |  |\n| Infectious  |  |  |  |\n| Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections  | 30 (3 confirmed)  | lexas  | Evacuees  |\n| Vibrio vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus wound infections  | 24 (6 deaths)  | Arkansas， Arizona， Georgia， Louisiana， Mississippi， Oklahoma， Texas Evacuees  |  |\n| Tinea corporis  | 17  | Mississippi  | Rescue workers  |\n| Noninfectious  |  |  |  |\n| Arthropod bites (likely mite)  | 97  | Louisiana  | Rescue workers  |\n| Diarrheal disease  |  |  |  |\n| Acute gastroenteritis， some attributed to norovirus  | Approximately 1，000  | Louisiana， Mississippi， Tennessee， Texas  | Evacuees  |\n| Nontoxigenic V.cholerae 01  | 6  |  | Evacuees  |\n| Nontyphoidal Salmonella  | 1  | Arizona， Georgia， Mississippi， Oklahoma， Tennessee Mississippi  | Evacuee  |\n| Respiratory disease  |  |  |  |\n| PertussIs  | 1  | lennessee  | Evacuee  |\n| Respiratory syncytial virus  | 1  | Texas  | Evacuee  |\n| Streptococcal pharyngitis  | 1  | Texas  | Evacuee  |\n| Tuberculosis  | 1  | Pennsvlvania  | Evacuee  |\n| Other condition  |  |  |  |\n| Presumed viral conjunctivitis  | Approximately 200  | Louisiana  | Evacuee  |\n\n【10】\\Other diseases and conditions， for which the number of cases was unknown， included scabies： circumferential lesions at waist； contact dermatitis； erythematous， papular， pustular rash consistent with folliculitis； immersion foot； prickly heat； influenza-like illness and upper respiratory infections； and head lice.\n\n【11】删除31：<u>Source： CDC： Www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm54d926a1.htm.</u>\n\n【12】Date of admission\n\n【13】\\ N = 22； Alabama， a third state under surveillance， reported no cases. t Nontoxigenic V. cholerae illnesses represent infections entirely distinct from the disease cholera， which is caused by toxigenic V. cholerae serogroup 01 or O139.\n\n【14】s Date of admission was not available for one Louisiana resident.

The third-generation cephalosporins， quinolones， tetracyclines， and other classes are effective clinically and in in vitro susceptibility tests. On occa-sion， ampicillin may be resistant. Patients die usually not because of antimicrobial resistance but for other reasons (overwhelming sepsis or immunosuppression). The most virulent Vibrio， V. vulnificus， has been found to be equally sensitive to the usually available antimicrobial agents.\n\n【18】Most Vibrio species have the following characteristics： they are gram negative， facultatively anaerobic， straight， curved， or comma-shaped rods that are catalase and oxidase positive 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The typical Vibrio organism shows a rapid growth (1-2days) on blood agar plate， or special media， thiosulfate-citrate-bile salts-sucrose(TCBS)， and is motile.

The CDC set up a task force in 2006 to investigate the increased number of inquiries received regarding this unexplained cutaneous condition (crawling， biting， stinging， and other vague complaints). In addition to skin manifestations， some sufferers also reported fatigue， mental confusion， short-term memory loss， joint pain， and changes in vision. These symptoms were clinically not true soft tissue infections.\n\n【21】The results of the comprehensive CDC study of unexplained apparent der-mopathy have been published 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，6\\]</u>. These studies demonstrated no evidence for an infectious cause of this syndrome， and no evidence of an environmental link. Although the cause of this syndrome is unknown， a common viewpoint of medical professionals， including most dermatologists， is that the symptoms are most compatible with \"delusional parasitosis.\"Another name associated with this disorder is \"Morgellons.\"\n\n【22】Additional comments on disaster conditions (hurricane， unsanitarylrefugee camp)\n\n【23】· The most common infectious diseases are those already present in the envi-ronment before the event.\n\n【24】· Such diseases may be magnified under those conditions (skin abscesses， scabies or mite infestations， diarrhea， and respiratory diseases).\n\n【25】· Exotic diseases are unusual， unless specifically introduced into the environ-ment or camp 删除10：<u>(as happened in Haiti with cholera， following the earthquake of January， 2010)</u> 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【26】Unsanitary conditions， overcrowding， and lack of a clean or adequate water supply facilitate transmission of many communicable or contagious diseases.",

There is a family history of thyroid disease.\nExamination\n\n【4】There are multiple, well-demarcated, non-scaly macules of depigmentation in a symmetrical distribution, predominantly over the trunk 删除33：<u></u>. The periorbital, perioral  删除换行1 and genital areas are also affected. Some of the macules have tiny pigmented spots within  删除换行1 them.\n\n【5】删除3：<u>Figure 40.1</u>\n\n【6】Questions\n\n【7】• What is the diagnosis?\n\n【8】• What are the different presentations of  删除换行1 this disease?\n\n【9】• How should this patient be managed?\nANSWER 40\n\n【10】This patient presented with depigmentation (leucoderma) which was asymptomatic and  删除换行1 symmetrical. Causes of hypopigmentation include albinism, hypopituitarism, chemical  删除换行1 leucoderma such as with phenolics, and post-inflammatory change secondary to inflammatory dermatoses such as eczema. Onset in this patient was in adulthood (acquired) with  删除换行1 gradual deterioration, which led to the diagnosis of vitiligo.\n\n【11】Vitiligo is a depigmenting acquired disease that occurs due to loss of epidermal melanocytes. Vitiligo has been reported to be associated with autoimmune disease including  删除换行1 thyroid disease, pernicious anaemia and type 1 diabetes mellitus. The cause of vitiligo is,  删除换行1 however, unknown. It affects 1 per cent of the population, usually occurring between the  删除换行1 ages of 10 and 30 years. Vitiligo affects all racial groups, but is particularly distressing  删除换行1 in those with darker skin.\n\n【12】Vitiligo is characterized by sharply defined pale/white macules. Most commonly affected  删除换行1 are periorbital, perioral and anogenital areas, but also the axillae, inguinal regions and  删除换行1 extensor sites of the knees/elbows. Symmetrical involvement is the norm. In addition,  删除换行1 white hair and prematurely grey hair can occur.\nThere are several types: a focal type which is characterized by one or more macules;  删除换行1 segmental vitiligo occurs when the disease develops unilaterally, for instance, down one  删除换行1 leg; generalized or universal disease can also occur. In patients with lighter skin where  删除换行1 the contrast between disease and normal skin is less obvious, then a Wood’s light can be  删除换行1 very helpful to evaluate the macules.\nThe course of vitiligo is variable; however, most patients’ course is quite rapid at  删除换行1 the onset followed by a period of stability. Treatments are generally unsatisfactory.\nPhotoprotective advice is essential for involved skin. Cosmetic camouflage can be useful.\nTo induce repigmentation, topical corticosteroids and topical calcineurin inhibitors such  删除换行1 as tacrolimus can be effective for focal lesions. For more extensive disease phototherapy  删除换行1 including psoralen–UVA and narrow-band UVB are effective in some patients. Response  删除换行1 to phototherapy is usually evidenced initially by follicular repigmentation where tiny  删除换行1 macular dots of pigmented skin are seen. In extensive disease, patients may be offered  删除换行1 depigmentation of their remaining normal skin using monobezyl ether or hydroquinone.\n\n【13】 KEY POINTS\n\n【14】• Vitiligo occurs due to loss of epidermal melanocytes.\n\n【15】• It has been reported to be associated with autoimmune disease.\n\n【16】• Focal, segmental and generalized types exist.",

He was playing with marbles in the playground when his mother noticed him cough and become acutely short of breath. Her attempt to dislodge the object on site was unsuccessful, and he was brought to the hospital. Prior to this incident he was healthy. His vaccinations are up-to-date, and he takes no medications. On chest x-ray, which portion of the lung is most likely to appear abnormal?\n\n【1】> (A) Left lower lobe\n\n【2】> (B) Left upper lobe\n\n【3】> (C) Lingula\n\n【4】> (D) Right lower lobe\n\n【5】> (E) Right upper lobe\n\n【6】 Answer: The correct answer is D. The right main bronchus is more vertical and wider than the left, and aspirated particles are more likely to lodge at the junction of the right inferior and right middle bronchi. Because of this, aspiration pneumonia contracted when an individual is in an upright position is most common in the right lower and middle lobes. On x-ray, the right lower lobe may appear collapsed as a result of foreign object aspiration.  \nAnswer A is incorrect. The left main bronchus is narrower and less vertical than the right main bronchus. The right main bronchus is more vertical and wider than the left, and aspirated particles are more likely to lodge at the junction of the right inferior and right middle bronchi.  \nAnswer B is incorrect. The left main bronchus is narrower and less vertical than the right main bronchus. The right main bronchus is more vertical and wider than the left, and aspirated particles are more likely to lodge at the junction of the right inferior and right middle bronchi.  \nAnswer C is incorrect. The lingula is in the left lung, and the left main bronchus is narrower and less vertical than the right main bronchus. The right main bronchus is more vertical and wider than the left, and aspirated particles are more likely to lodge at the junction of the right inferior and right middle bronchi.  \nAnswer E is incorrect.

He reports that it worsened over the last several months after he suffered a fall and was immobilized in bed for several weeks. He has tried to treat the area with numerous over-the-counter antifungals, which helps reduce the rash slightly for short periods of time, but it recurs. On examination, there is an erythematous, macerated, eroded plaque in the inguinal folds extending to the scrotum and the medial thigh with surrounding scattered satellite papules and pustules 通用删除7(英):<u>( 68 )</u>.\n\n【4】i. Which pathogen is responsible for this eruption?\n\n【5】ii. What other cutaneous manifestations can this pathogen produce?\n\n【6】iii. What populations are at higher risk of infection?\n\n【7】iv. What is the next best step in treatment?\n\n【8】Answer 68\n\n【9】i. Intertrigo is a commonly used term to define inflammation within the skin folds. Superimposed infection with Candida can occur in areas of occlusion and particularly after periods of prolonged immobilization. The most common candida species that cause mucocutaneous candidiasis are Candida albicans and C. tropicalis.\n\n【10】Candidal intertrigo usually involves the inguinal folds, between the buttocks, and/or inframammary folds. It classically presents with brightly erythematous irritable skin in moist areas that develops cracks or fissures. The rash is often sore and satellite papules, pustules or vesicles are often seen at the periphery. Candidiasis in the web spaces between the fingers is also known as erosio interdigitalis blastomycetica. It most commonly occurs between the third and fourth digits and is seen in individuals whose hands or feet are frequently exposed to water.\n\n【11】ii. In addition to intertrigo, candidal infections can produce a wide range of mucocutaneous manifestations, including oral candidiasis or oral thrush, angular cheilitis, vulvovaginal candidiasis in women, balanitis in men, chronic paronychia, onychomycosis and chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC).\n\n【12】CMC describes a group of disorders involving progressive and recurrent candidal infections of the skin, nails and mucous membranes with C. albicans . It is typically seen in patients with significant underlying immunologic abnormalities or autoimmune endocrinopathies.\n\n【13】iii. There are various predisposing factors for mucocutaneous candidiasis, including diabetes mellitus, occlusion or immobilization, hyperhidrosis, use of corticosteroids or antibiotics and immunosuppressed status.\n\n【14】CMC is observed in association with immunodeficiency disorders such as severe combined immunodeficiency, DiGeorge syndrome and hyper-IgE syndrome, as well as other non-immunologic inherited disorders such as keratitis ichthyosis deafness (KID) syndrome, multiple carboxylase deficiency, acrodermatitis enteropathica and ectodermal dysplasia–ectrodactyly–clefting syndrome. A subgroup of CMC occurs in the setting of autoimmune polyendocrinopathy–candidiasis–ectodermal dystrophy syndrome (APECED) and dectin-1 deficiency.\n\n【15】iv. The treatment of mucocutaneous candidal infections depends on the type of infection. Oral medications include fluconazole, itraconazole and nystatin (swish and swallow for oropharyngeal candidiasis). Topical treatments include clotrimazole, miconazole, tioconazole and nystatin. For candidal intertrigo or balanitis, topical imidazoles or ciclopirox can be used, with systemic agents reserved for recalcitrant or severe cases.\n\n【16】CMC does not typically respond to standard topical medications. Treatment usually requires long-term therapy with oral systemic antifungal agents.",

Her mother received no prenatal care and， through a translator， reports that the patient was delivered without complication at home. As an infant， the girl had a \"wartlike\" perioral maculopapular rash and three or four recurrent right-sided ear infections. Physical examination reveals that the girl is in the 30th percentile for weight and the 35th percentile for height. Additional observations include fundi that are notable for nummular keratitis， prominent notching of her upper two incisors and molars， and outward bowing of the tibia bilaterally.\n\n【2】What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【3】Congenital syphilis. This infection is one of the so-called ToRCHeS infections (Toxoplasmosis， other infections， Rubella， Cytomegalovirus， Herpes simplex virus， Syphilis)， the most common causes of congenital infection.\n\n【4】What is the causative microorganism in this condition?\n\n【5】Treponema pallidum.\n\n【6】What symptoms are commonly found in patients with this condition?\n\n【7】Congenital syphilis is a cause of hydrops fetalis， or stillbirth due to fluid accumulation in the fetus.

VDRL testing detects anticardiolipin antibodies that are produced by patients with syphilis. The serum VDRL is used for screening pur etposes. VDRL testing from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples is used todetect central nervous system involvement of the disease， known as neurosyphilis. Other CSF findings such as pleocytosis (increased number of cells) and elevated protein levels also suggest infection.

        "text": "【0】Question: 35.1 A teenage boy presents with moderate to severe epigastric pain. Physical examination reveals extensive eruptive xanthomas and hepatosplenomegaly. A blood sample reveals milky plasma. Which of the following is the most likely lipoprotein to be elevated in this patient’s plasma?\n\n【1】A. Chylomicrons\n\n【2】B. Chylomicron remnants\n\n【3】C. HDL\n\n【4】D. IDL\n\n【5】E. LDL\n\n【6】Answer: 35.1 A . This patient presents with classical symptoms of hypertriglyceridemia: milky plasma, eruptive xanthomas, enlarged liver and spleen, and symptoms of pancreatitis. The milky plasma is due to abnormally high chylomicron levels, indicating that TG is not being removed from the transporter of dietary TG and it is accumulating in the plasma. The other lipoproteins listed have low levels of TG are much smaller and would not be expected to lead to milky plasma if elevated.\n\n【7】Question: 35.2 Laboratory results for a patient with uncontrolled type 1 diabetes mellitus reveal hyperglycemia (634 mg/dL) and hypertriglyceridemia (498 mg/dL). The most likely cause of the hypertriglyceridemia in this patient is which of the following?\n\n【8】A. Deficiency in apoprotein C-II\n\n【9】B. Increased hepatic triglyceride synthesis\n\n【10】C. Decreased lipoprotein lipase activity\n\n【11】D. Deficiency in LDL receptors\n\n【12】E. Absence of hormone sensitive lipase\n\n【13】Answer: 35.2 C . Decreased lipoprotein lipase activity is the result of the failure of the pancreatic β cells to produce and secrete insulin. Insulin stimulates the synthesis of lipoprotein lipase; in the absence of insulin, lipoprotein lipase activity in the capillary beds is low. While a deficiency in apoC-II would also lead to hypertriglyceridemia, this genetic defect is rare. If a patient with type I diabetes mellitus is not given insulin, then the increased glucagon–insulin ratio would stimulate gluconeogenesis and β oxidation in the liver rather than synthesis of triglycerides. Neither a deficiency of LDL receptors nor hormone-sensitive lipase would be expected to increase circulating TG levels.\n\n【14】Question: 35.3 A 25-year-old woman was referred to a lipid research center for investigation of moderate hypertriglyceridemia because the plasma lipid and lipoprotein profiles showed abnormalities. Both HDL and LDL were more buoyant and showed elevations in TG content with the mass of TG approximately the same as that of cholesterol. A deficiency in which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient’s lipid abnormality?\n\n【15】A. Lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase\n\n【16】B. Lipoprotein lipase\n\n【17】C. Apoprotein C-II\n\n【18】D. Hepatic lipase\n\n【19】E. Apoprotein B-100\nAnswer: 35.3 D . Hepatic lipase. The abnormal buoyancies of the LDL and HDL fractions due to their increased TG content indicate that IDL is not being processed to LDL and HDL is not being remodeled. Both of these processes are accomplished by hepatic lipase. A deficiency in lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase would lead to elevated serum cholesterol levels, almost all as free cholesterol. Deficiencies in lipoprotein lipase or apoC-II would lead to hypertriglyceridemia as increased chylomicrons and/or VLDL. An apoB-100 deficiency would lead to increased levels of LDL, but they would have the normal TG/cholesterol ratio.\n\n【20】BIOCHEMISTRY PEARLS\n\n【21】 TGs are safely transported in the bloodstream packaged into lipoproteins called chylomicrons or VLDLs.\n\n【22】 The most common genetic defect leading to hypertriglyceridemia is a deficiency in lipoprotein lipase, which results in increased levels of both chylomicrons and VLDL.\n\n【23】 Individuals who are homozygous for the defective gene for lipoprotein lipase usually present with symptoms of chylomicronemia (TG levels > 2000 mg/dL, abdominal pain, pancreatitis, xanthomas, lipemia retinalis) in childhood.",

        "text": "【0】删除14：<u>1</u>\nCongenital Heart \n\n【1】Diseases\n\n【2】Case Presentation \n\n【3】A 31-year old man was referred to the cardiologist by a general physician, for  删除换行1 evaluation of a heart murmur. This young man had been denied a life insurance  删除换行1 policy because the physician, empanelled by the insurance company, had  删除换行1 incidentally noticed the murmur during medical examination. The man was normally  删除换行1 very active and denied complaints of chest pain, breathlessness, palpitations or  删除换行1 syncope. There was no history of cyanotic spells, joint pains or repeated chest  删除换行1 infections during childhood and he regularly played cricket and football in school.\nHowever, the patient recollected that the doctor in the school medical room had  删除换行1 noticed the murmur and made a note of it in his medical report.\nOn examination, the man was of average built and height and looked healthy.\nThe pulse was 84 beats/min. and regular with no special character. The BP was  删除换行1 134/76 mm Hg in the right arm while sitting. There was no anemia, cyanosis or  删除换行1 clinical sign of congestive heart failure. The apex beat was ill-sustained, heaving in  删除换行1 nature and slightly displaced towards the axilla. There was a pansystolic murmur over  删除换行1 the middle of the left sternal border with a S3 删除换行1  sound in early diastole. The murmur  删除换行1 did not radiate towards the axilla. There was no parasternal heave and the lower  删除换行1 border of the liver was not palpable. The lung fields were clear.\nCASE\n\n【4】1 Ventricular \n\n【5】Septal Defect\n\n【6】CLINICAL DISCUSSION \n\n【7】From the history and physical examination, this asymptomatic young man  删除换行1 had a parasternal pansystolic murmur. Typical causes of a pansystolic murmur  删除换行1 are mitral regurgitation, ventricular septal defect and tricuspid regurgitation.\nSometimes, tight coarctation of aorta or a patent ductus arteriosus with pulmonary  删除换行1 hypertension can also produce a pansystolic murmur but these murmurs are  删除换行1 usually located at the upper left sternal edge. The murmur of mitral regurgitation  删除换行1 radiates towards the axilla while the murmur of tricuspid regurgitation is usually  删除换行1 associated with engorged neck veins and an enlarged pulsatile liver.ECG of the patient showed biphasic RS complexes in the mid-precordial  删除换行1 leads. X-ray chest showed mild cardiomegaly with minimal signs of pulmonary  删除换行1 congestion. On ECHO, the left ventricle was normal in size with normal ejection  删除换行1 fraction. A signal drop-out was noticed in the mid-portion of the interventricular 4 Section 1 Congenital Heart Diseases 删除换行5 In VSD, a breach in the continuity of the interventricular septum creates a  删除换行1 left-to-right shunt between the ventricles 删除33：<u></u>. This congenital cardiac defect  删除换行1 occurs due to complexity of embryological development of the septum, which has  删除换行1 a membranous and a muscular portion. Most (80%) VSDs occur at the junction  删除换行1 of these sections and are termed as perimembranous VSD 删除33：<u></u>. Some VSDs  删除换行1 occur in the muscular section (muscular VSD) and may be multiple (sieve-like).\nRare varieties of VSD are endocardial cushion defects (supracristal VSD) and  删除换行1 outlet septal defect (subpulmonic VSD) .\n删除3：<u>Figure 1.1: Color flow map extending from  删除换行1 left ventricle to right ventricle</u>\n\n【8】删除3：<u>Figure 1.2: Ventricular septal defect 删除换行1 septum. There was no abnormality of the cardiac valves and the estimated  删除换行1 pulmonary artery pressure was normal. On color Doppler, an abnormal flow map  删除换行1 was observed extending from the left ventricle to the right ventricle 删除33：<u></u>, with  删除换行1 a high velocity jet on continuous wave Doppler. Therefore, the definite diagnosis  删除换行1 in this case is ventricular septal defect (VSD). Case 1 Ventricular Septal Defect 5</u>\nA small VSD (Maladie de Roger) generates a loud pansystolic murmur in a  删除换行1 localized area on the precordium. The murmur is located in the upper parasternal  删除换行1 area in outlet VSD and in the mid-portion in perimembranous VSD. A muscular  删除换行5 VSD produces a short systolic murmur since the defect shuts off during muscle  删除换行1 contraction in later systole. This murmur is located over the lower parasternal  删除换行1 area. A large VSD with elevated right ventricular pressure that equals left  删除换行1 ventricular pressure (bidirectional shunt) is also associated with an early systolic  删除换行1 murmur. Therefore, there is no correlation between the length or intensity of the  删除换行1 murmur and the size of the VSD.\nA large shunt may be accompanied by a diastolic flow murmur and a S3  删除换行1 sound, due to torrential flow across the mitral valve. The S2 is widely split due to  删除换行1 early aortic valve closure. On ECHO, signal drop-out is not observed if the VSD is  删除换行1 too small (<3 mm size) or muscular in location. The width of the colour flow map  删除换行1 approximates the VSD size. On Doppler, high flow velocity indicates a small VSD.\nThe flow velocity is low if the VSD is large and the shunt is bidirectional.\nVSD is the commonest form of congenital acyanotic heart disease and accounts  删除换行1 for 25% of all cardiac malformations. VSD may occur in isolation or as part of a  删除换行1 complex constellation of congenital cardiac abnormalities. Aortic regurgitation  删除换行1 may be associated due to lack of support to the aortic valve in perimembranous \n\n【9】删除3：<u>Figure 1.3: Various locations of ventricular septal defect (VSD)</u>\n\n【10】RA: Right atrium; RV: Right ventricle\n\n【11】Table 1.1: Types of ventricular septal defect\n\n【12】•  Perimembranous VSD\n\n【13】•  Subpulmonic VSD\n\n【14】•  Supracristal VSD\n\n【15】•  Muscular VSD6 Section 1 Congenital Heart Diseases\n\n【16】Table 1.2: Indications for surgical closure of VSD\n\n【17】•  Large-sized VSD with volume overload 删除换行1 (pulmonary to systemic flow ratio >2:1)\n•  Medium-sized VSD with congestive symptoms 删除换行1  without pulmonary hypertension \n\n【18】•  Small-sized VSD without congestive symptoms 删除换行1  with endocarditis or aortic regurgitation\n\n【19】VSD. Complications of VSD in childhood are growth retardation and repeated  删除换行1 chest infections. Reversal of shunt can occur later in life when pulmonary  删除换行1 pressure exceeds the systemic pressure. Endocarditis can follow any non-cardiac  删除换行1 surgical procedure.\n\n【20】MANAGEMENT ISSUES\n\n【21】Large sized VSDs allow large volumes of left-to-right shunt and usually present  删除换行1 in childhood with failure to thrive, breathlessness and recurrent respiratory  删除换行1 infections. They can lead to pulmonary hypertension, right heart failure and  删除换行1 ultimately reversal of shunt (right-to-left). This is designated as the Eisenmenger’s  删除换行1 syndrome. Such VSDs are usually closed in childhood to avoid complications and  删除换行1 before the Eisenmenger’s syndrome has developed.Medium sized VSDs are associated with a moderate sized shunt. The shunt  删除换行1 is large enough to cause breathlessness, but not enough to cause pulmonary  删除换行1 hypertension and shunt reversal. Such patients do reasonably well during  删除换行1 childhood, but may become progressively symptomatic as left ventricular  删除换行1 compliance declines with age and pulmonary venous congestion develops. Such  删除换行5 VSDs are usually closed in adulthood, to avoid the development of heart failure.\nSmall sized VSDs do not cause significant shunting and are often asymptomatic. Some of them may close as the child grows older. Those that do not close  删除换行1 spontaneously are closed by intervention for reasons other than the shunt.\nThese reasons are development of endocarditis or associated significant aortic  删除换行1 regurgitation .\nRECENT ADVANCES \n\n【22】The last decade or two have witnessed remarkable progress in the percutaneous  删除换行1 techniques for closure of ventricular septal defects, thus avoiding the risks  删除换行1 associated with open heart surgery. Although transesophageal echocardiography  删除换行1 (TEE) generally suffices to guide the deployment of the closure device, intracardiac  删除换行1 ultrasound provides more accurate assessment. Sonography can provide vital  删除换行1 information pertaining to the location and size of the defect and the rim around  删除换行1 it, so as to facilitate proper device selection and placement. CASE",

He had recently  删除换行1 moved into a flat with friends who had noticed the lesion and advised him to go to the  删除换行5 GP. As far as the patient can remember he has had a mole on his back since childhood  删除换行1 at the site of the nodule. He has Fitzpatrick skin type I and always burns in the sun, if  删除换行1 not careful, and never tans. His family is also fair skinned. He is otherwise well and takes  删除换行1 no medication.\nExamination\n\n【2】There is a reddish brown nodule arising from a deeply pigmented, irregular macule with  删除换行1 variable colour 删除33：<u></u>. Full skin examination reveals freckling over his face and  删除换行1 shoulders and multiple acquired moles which looked benign.\n\n【3】INVESTIGATIONS\n\n【4】Excision of the lesion was performed.\n\n【5】Questions\n\n【6】• What is the likely diagnosis?\n\n【7】• What determines his prognosis?\n• How should this patient be managed?\n\n【8】删除3：<u>Figure 64.1146</u>\n\n【9】ANSWER 64\n\n【10】This young man has a nodular pigmented lesion on the posterior trunk that has changed  删除换行1 in size, shape and colour. The clinical appearance of this lesion should immediately raise  删除换行1 the possibility of a nodular malignant melanoma.\n\n【11】Any patient concerned about a mole or skin lesion should have a full skin examination to  删除换行1 check all their moles. A suspected melanoma should be excised for histological analysis  删除换行1 with a 2-mm margin around it. The pathologist will report the thickness of the melanoma –  删除换行1 the Breslow thickness (local invasion) in millimetres. This is the measurement between  删除换行1 the granular cell layer to the deepest identifiable melanoma cell. The full skin check of  删除换行1 a patient with a suspected malignant melanoma should also include examination of the  删除换行1 lymph nodes.\nThe ‘gold standard’ treatment of melanomas is surgical. The extent of surgery depends  删除换行1 on the thickness of the melanoma and its site. A small area of normal skin around the  删除换行1 melanoma is also excised to ensure that all melanoma cells have been removed. This is  删除换行1 termed a wide local excision (WLE). For lesions with a Breslow thickness of \u0005 1 mm  删除换行1 a 1-cm WLE is required; for lesions \u0007 1 mm a 2-cm WLE is advised. For these thicker  删除换行1 melanomas a technique called a sentinel lymph node biopsy may be offered to patients  删除换行1 to exclude lymphatic spread. The sentinel lymph node biopsy can predict the presence  删除换行1 of clinically non-detectable metastatic melanoma within regional lymph nodes through  删除换行1 histopathology. The first node draining a lymphatic basin is termed the ‘sentinel node’.\nIf positive, a full basin clearance is offered and all the nodes are examined for further  删除换行1 micro-metastases.\n\n【12】If the melanoma has spread to distant sites adjuvant therapies may be offered, but the  删除换行1 prognosis is very poor. Distant metastases most commonly occur in lungs, liver, brain,  删除换行1 bone and intestines.\nPrognosis is determined by the staging classification: local disease T 1–4 a, b; disease in  删除换行1 the regional lymph nodes N 1–3; and distant spread M 1a, b, c. The thinner the Breslow  删除换行1 thickness, the better the prognosis. For those patients whose melanoma is \u0007 4 mm thick,  删除换行1 50 per cent will die within 5 years.\nFollowing diagnosis, regular follow-up is essential to detect any recurrence. This includes  删除换行1 local, lymphatic (lymph nodes) and blood borne (to distant sites). Examination of the  删除换行1 scar site to exclude in-transit metastases, full skin examination, lymph node checks and  删除换行1 palpation for organomegaly are required. A full systematic review should also be performed to exclude any distant spread. The periodicy and regularity of follow-up is also  删除换行1 determined by the stage of the melanoma.\n\n【13】 KEY POINTS\n\n【14】• Patients with a changing naevus should have a full skin examination.\n• Breslow thickness measures the invasion depth of a melanoma in millimetres.\n\n【15】• Sentinel lymph node biopsy predicts clinically non-detectable metastatic disease.",

Discuss the pathophysiology of the likely diagnosis and suggest how the patient  删除换行1 may be treated.\n通用删除5(英):<u>DOI: 10.1201/9781003242697-</u>\nANSWERS\n\n【15】This woman presents with polyuria, nocturia and polydipsia. These symptoms have four  删除换行1 important differential diagnoses: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> diabetes mellitus; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> diabetes insipidus, which may  删除换行1 either be central or nephrogenic in origin; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> hypercalcaemia, which may present like the  删除换行1 above in an acute setting; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> primary polydipsia (PP). Therefore, investigations need to  删除换行1 be directed at elucidating one of the above diagnoses.\nDiabetes insipidus is a relatively rare disease characterised by the excretion of large volumes of dilute urine as a result of either a deficiency of or a resistance to the actions of  删除换行1 the posterior pituitary hormone, antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as arginine  删除换行1 vasopressin (AVP). ADH is released into the circulation from the posterior pituitary  删除换行1 gland in response to an increase in serum osmolality and acts to increase reabsorption of water by inserting aquaporin-2 (AQP2) channels into the apical membrane of  删除换行1 the distal parts of the nephron. Deficiency of ADH leads to central diabetes insipidus  删除换行1 (CDI), while failure of the kidney to respond to its actions causes nephrogenic diabetes  删除换行1 insipidus (NDI).\nDiagnosis of diabetes insipidus includes basic laboratory investigations and a fluid deprivation test. Hypernatraemia may be found secondary to dehydration, while urinalysis may  删除换行1 show a low specific gravity (<1.005). Serum osmolality is increased due to excess free water  删除换行1 loss. It may be formally measured or estimated using the formula: 2 × [Na+] + [urea] + [glucose], which would be around 300 mOsm/kg in this patient. Similarly, urine osmolality will  删除换行1 be low, generally less than 200 mOsm/kg, due to inadequate reabsorption of water from the  删除换行1 distal parts of the nephron.\nWhen the diagnosis is equivocal, a fluid deprivation test may be performed. Patients are  删除换行1 deprived of fluid intake for a period of 8 hours, with hourly measurement of body weight, urine  删除换行1 volume and urine osmolality. After allowing a sufficient time for dehydration, desmopressin  删除换行1 (synthetic ADH) is administered subcutaneously, and a final urine sample is taken 1 hour afterwards to measure urine osmolality.\nThe essence of the test is that with CDI, urine will become more concentrated once the  删除换行1 deficient ADH is replaced, whereas with NDI, the inability of the kidney to respond to ADH \n\n【16】means that any further replacement by ADH has no effect.\nCDI is commonly idiopathic. However, autoantibodies against ADH-secreting cells of the  删除换行1 hypothalamus may be detected, especially if the patient exhibits other autoimmune conditions, such as hypothyroidism, as in this case. Other causes of CDI include brain tumours,  删除换行1 such as germinomas and craniopharyngiomas; neurosurgery; head injury; and infiltrative  删除换行1 conditions, such as Langerhans cell histiocytosis. There are also genetic forms of the disease,  删除换行1 with the majority being inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion with mutations in the \n\n【17】ADH gene.CDI responds well to ADH replacement, usually via the synthetic analogue desmopressin  删除换行1 (DDAVP). High-dose DDAVP may be used for mild cases of NDI, but treatment of NDI  删除换行5 requires management of the underlying cause (e.g. correcting metabolic abnormalities, discontinuing any offending drugs). In any case, treatment is required only if the patient is suffering from severe dehydration, with urine volumes >4 L per day. Case 1: Polyuria and Polydipsia 5 \n\n【18】KEY POINTS \n\n【19】• Causes of polyuria and polydipsia include diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus,  删除换行1 hypercalcaemia and PP.\n• Diabetes insipidus is due either to inadequate central production of ADH or failure of the kidneys to respond to ADH.\n• Central diabetes insipidus is frequently idiopathic and managed with synthetic \n\n【20】ADH (desmopressin).",

        "text": "【0】Question: A 40-year-old woman presents with a persistent cough of two months’ duration. She reports a 6.8-kg (15-lb) unintentional weight loss and general loss of appetite. She says she drinks wine occasionally but has never smoked cigarettes. X-ray of the chest reveals a subpleural mass. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【1】> (A) Adenocarcinoma of the lung\n\n【2】> (B) Carcinoid tumor of the lung\n\n【3】> (C) Metastases to lung from a primary tumor from another tissue type\n\n【4】> (D) Small-cell carcinoma of the lung\n\n【5】> (E) Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung\n Answer: The correct answer is A . Critical points to consider in this question are first, that the patient is a nonsmoker; second, that the lesion is localized peripherally (subpleural mass); and third, that the patient is a woman. About 95% of all lung cancers can be classified into one of two categories: small cell lung cancers make up 13%, and non-small cell lung cancers (consisting of adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinomas, and other histologic types) make up the rest. Adenocarcinoma is the most prevalent type of lung cancer, representing 38% of all diagnosed cases. Relative to squamous cell carcinoma (the second most prevalent subtype), adenocarcinoma is more often seen in non-smokers than in smokers (62% vs 18%), and more often seen in women than in men irrespective of smoking status. Treatment interventions differ by type. Because adenocarcinomas are typically peripherally located (75%), they often are more amenable to surgical removal than other tumor types, although the success of treatment depends more on the stage of the tumor than the type. Adenocarcinoma often, but not always, presents as multiple masses.  \nAnswer B is incorrect . Carcinoid tumors are found in major bronchi and may cause carcinoid syndrome (flushing due to excessive histamine release). They are of neuroendocrine origin and have no link with smoking.  \nAnswer C is incorrect . Although metastases from other organs arise more commonly than primary lung tumors, they are most often multifocal, not a single peripheral nodule. Metastases to lung principally arise from primary tumors of the breast, colon, and kidney.  \nAnswer D is incorrect . Small cell carcinoma of the lung is an undifferentiated tumor usually present in a central location. There is a strong association with smoking and it is more often seen in men. Small cell carcinoma metastasizes early and may secrete hormones such as ADH and ACTH. Small cell lung cancer is rarely resectable and is most often treated with combination chemotherapy and radiation.  \nAnswer E is incorrect . Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung often presents as a centrally located hilar mass. This lung cancer subtype is more common in men, and it exhibits the strongest link to smoking.",

Two days prior to presentation he developed increased secretions and was febrile to 38.9°C (102°F). On the day of presentation, his family noted labored breathing and he became less interactive, which prompted the visit to the emergency department (ED).Past Medical and Surgical History\n---------------------------------\n\n【6】The teen is wheelchair dependent, with problems already described.

Parents provide all care for their son without home nursing.\n增加换行1: Current Status\n--------------\n\n【9】In the ED, the teen requires aggressive respiratory treatment but is ultimately intubated and mechanically ventilated. He is transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) where a chest tube is placed to evacuate a pleural effusion, noted on the admission chest radiograph. This child was intubated with attempts to extubate twice through his PICU stay. As a result of the two failed extubation attempts, his underlying muscle weakness and restrictive lung disease, the PICU team felt a tracheostomy may be of benefit.\n增加换行1: Questions\n---------\n\n【10】Answer the following questions using the details provided.\n\n【11】1.  Has the PICU team given this teen significant opportunity to recover from his illness and adequate chance for successful extubation before suggesting tracheostomy?

Based on this case, when would an ethics committee consult be warranted?Rationale and Evidence‐based Practice Explanation\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】### Has the PICU team given this teen significant opportunity to recover from his illness and adequate chance for successful extubation before suggesting tracheostomy? If so, when is the appropriate time to perform tracheostomy?\n\n【15】There is no consensus about the appropriate time to consider performing a tracheostomy for pediatric patients. Several retrospective studies have shown that tracheostomy performed before 14 days is associated with shorter hospital length of stay and fewer complications than tracheostomy performed after 14 days 删除10：<u>(Holloway et al . 2015 )</u>. In this case, there were two failed extubations, a 22‐day PICU length of stay, and an expected prolonged hospitalization even if a tracheostomy is performed. The patient’s parents stated they were not interested in pursuing a tracheostomy.\n\n【16】### How does the team gain consensus with the family on plan of care?\n\n【17】Families consistently rate communication as one of the most important skills of clinicians, often as important as clinical skills, especially during critical illness. Parents want honest, clear, and complete information in order to participate in the decision‐making for the care of their children even if it is distressing. Seaman et al . 通用删除7(英):<u>( 2017 )</u> identified five goals of clinician–family communication, including establishing a trusting relationship, providing emotional support, helping families understand the prognosis and treatment options, allowing clinicians to understand the patient as a person, and creating conditions for careful deliberation about difficult decisions.

The Informed Medical Decisions Foundation, American College of Critical Care Medicine (ACCM), and American Thoracic Society have defined shared decision‐making as a collaborative process that allows patients, or their surrogates, and providers to make healthcare decisions together, based on the best scientific evidence available and the patient’s values, goals, and preferences.\n\n【24】The standard approach to shared decision‐making occurs when:\n\n【25】   providers share information with families about the patient’s medical condition, prognosis, and therapeutic options along with the associated risks of each option, including the option of palliative care; 删除换行1    the family shares with the provider the patient’s values, goals and preferences; 删除换行1    the provider and family deliberate together to determine the best treatment option for the patient and the patient is included if developmentally appropriate and clinically able; 删除换行1    once global goals and preferences are determined, the provider is responsible for making routine decisions (e.g. frequency of vital signs and laboratory data); 删除换行1    the provider explains the care provided and rationale in language that is understandable to the patient and family and elicits their preferences in the decision‐making process 删除10：<u>(Kon et al . 2016 ; Davidson et al . 2017 )</u>. The clinician should elicit the patient and family’s preferred method of decision‐making and tailor their own role to match the family’s preference.\n\n【26】### As a family–provider communication opportunity, what are the essential components of the family meeting?\n\n【27】There are several platforms for family communication including participation in daily ICU rounds, daily updates, electronic patient portals, and interdisciplinary family meetings 删除10：<u>(Seaman et al . 2017 )</u>. Teleconferencing and video conferencing offer the added benefit of allowing ICU providers to communicate with physically distanced family members, other family support individuals such as faith leaders, family friends, and other members of the healthcare team 删除10：<u>(De Havenon et al . 2015 )</u>. Ultimately, the ICU family meeting is an essential means of communication about patient status and subsequent decision‐making about goals of care.\n\n【28】Although the evidence to support the benefits of family meetings is substantial, they often fail to occur in a timely manner. Some studies have shown these benefits from family meeting that occur 3–6 days after admission, but the ACCM recommends that multidisciplinary family meetings occur within 24–48 hours of ICU admission and are scheduled at regular intervals. Family meetings should be timely, occur in a setting that is quiet with adequate seating, and include appropriate interprofessional team members.\n\n【29】There are many barriers to family meetings, including burdens of schedule coordination, lack of provider availability, and physical distance of pertinent family participants. Other barriers to family meetings include inadequate communication skill training of providers, cultural barriers, language, and emotional stress for providers (and families). Table 42.3 shows strategies to overcome some of these barriers. The ACCM Guideline for Family Conferences advocates for multiple strategies to improve the effectiveness of family conferences 删除10：<u>(Kon et al . 2016 )</u>.\n\n【30】The family meeting structure allows for other team members to listen, clarify issues as appropriate, and affirm decisions. A scribe documents the discussion and may use a template to transfer information to the chart.\n\n【31】### What successful processes are utilized in the family meeting?\n\n   The family meeting is planned to include all identified family and healthcare team members.\n   A venue for inclusion of distant family members is provided by video conferencing.\n    Table 42.3 Goals of family communication.\n删除31：<u>    Source: Seaman et al . 通用删除7(英):<u>( 2017 )</u>.</u>\n    | Goal | Skills | Strategies |\n    | --- | --- | --- |\n    | Establish a trusting relationship | Patient and sensitive listening Providing consistent message about patient’s condition and plan of care | VALUE Ascertain family’s communication preferences Manage specialists’ input (may require a preliminary multidisciplinary meeting) |\n    | Provide emotional support | Addressing emotions (e.g. anger, grief, guilt) If necessary, preparing patient and family for death | VALUE Consider consults to pastoral care, child life specialist |\n    | Help families understand diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment options | Recognizing cultural and language barriers Tailoring explanation of complex physiology and technology to family’s level of knowledge | Include interpreter if language barrier exists or requested by family |\n    | Help families understand diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment options | Recognizing cultural and language barriers Tailoring explanation of complex physiology and technology to family’s level of knowledge | Avoid medical jargon, use simple lay terms |\n    | Help families understand diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment options | Recognizing cultural and language barriers Tailoring explanation of complex physiology and technology to family’s level of knowledge | Tailor language to the comprehension level of the family |\n    | Help families understand diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment options | Recognizing cultural and language barriers Tailoring explanation of complex physiology and technology to family’s level of knowledge | Use written or electronic supplementary materials (e.g. pamphlets, diagrams) |\n    | Help families understand diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment options | Recognizing cultural and language barriers Tailoring explanation of complex physiology and technology to family’s level of knowledge | Develop awareness of own bias to remain open to patient and family preferences that differ from your own |\n    | Allow clinicians to understand the patient as a person | Eliciting information about values, goals, and treatment preferences | VALUE |\n    | Create conditions for careful deliberation about difficult decisions | Attending to family dynamics Conflict resolution Assisting in decisions about life sustaining therapies | Use shared decision‐making |\n    | Create conditions for careful deliberation about difficult decisions | Attending to family dynamics Conflict resolution Assisting in decisions about life sustaining therapies | Dedicated multidisciplinary family meetings |\n    | Create conditions for careful deliberation about difficult decisions | Attending to family dynamics Conflict resolution Assisting in decisions about life sustaining therapies | Ethics consultation |\n    | Create conditions for careful deliberation about difficult decisions | Attending to family dynamics Conflict resolution Assisting in decisions about life sustaining therapies | Palliative care consultation |\n    | Create conditions for careful deliberation about difficult decisions | Attending to family dynamics Conflict resolution Assisting in decisions about life sustaining therapies | Facilitate restful sleep for families (e.g. private room, noise reduction strategies) |\n    | Create conditions for careful deliberation about difficult decisions | Attending to family dynamics Conflict resolution Assisting in decisions about life sustaining therapies | Consider involving the child in decisions if developmentally appropriate and clinically able |\n   The physician uses a strategy to seek information from the family about their child, acknowledge their emotions, listen to their concerns, and offer options.\n   The meeting is held in a quiet place, gaining family perception by asking for their input, inviting them to share their knowledge, and providing knowledge about care options.\n   Shared decision‐making was facilitated by providing information about care choices, eliciting family preferences, and deliberating to reach a decision.\n\n【33】### When should the palliative care team be consulted?\n\n【34】Palliative care strives to manage pain, incorporate psychosocial and spiritual care, identify values of patients and their loved ones, and resolve conflicts in cases in which the patient is terminally ill 删除10：<u>(Celie and Prager, 2016 )</u>. According to the Center to Advance Palliative Care 通用删除7(英):<u>( 2016 )</u>, children with complex medical problems are surviving longer due to new and improved treatments, especially among preterm infants and neonates with congenital disorders. It is currently estimated that there are approximately 400 000 children living with life‐threatening or chronic complex conditions, with about 17 million adults serving as caregivers to these children. Despite some concern about consulting too soon, it is recommended to introduce the concept of palliative care early in the life of a child who has a life‐limiting condition 删除10：<u>(Center to Advance Palliative Care, 2016 )</u>. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends initiating a palliative care consult when a diagnosis is made and integrating interventions, both curative and comfort measures, throughout the course of illness to support quality of life. Unfortunately, only about half of all children’s hospitals have formal palliative care programs, so much more work needs to be done to improve access for children and families.\n\n【35】### Based on this case, when would an ethics committee consult be warranted?\n\n【36】Ethics consultation is a commonly accepted procedure for facilitating communication, resolving conflict, and easing moral distress in healthcare. It should be pursued when there is disagreement among team members or between the medical team and family. Some situations that may warrant an ethics consult include family preference to withdraw life‐sustaining therapy when the medical team believes continuing therapy is in the best interests of the child; family request for interventions the medical team believes are futile; and family desire to perform rituals that violate state health and safety codes 删除10：<u>(Kon et al . 2016 )</u>. The ethics committee is advisory only and consults can come from individual healthcare providers, a healthcare team or family members. The consult will provide recommendations based on the posed question. Studies have shown that ethics consults decrease ICU length of stay and life‐sustaining therapies for patients who potentially will not survive to discharge. These consults may reduce prolonged suffering for patients and families.\n\n【37】Ethicists use four main ethical principles to guide recommendations for complex cases.\n\n【38】   Beneficence: the therapy must help the patient.\n   Non‐maleficence: the therapy must not harm the patient.\n   Justice: therapies must be applied fairly.\n   Autonomy: the patient must be free to decide.\n\n【39】In this case, ethical questions may include the following.\n\n【40】   Would a tracheostomy be of benefit or could it cause harm?\n   Is it fair that a child receive a tracheostomy?\n   Given that tracheostomy is a standard therapy, can parents opt not to pursue tracheostomy?\n\n【41】In this case, the ethical considerations were not challenged. The values and judgments of parents should generally be honored in difficult ethical matters, although providers can seek to override parental wishes when the parent’s request is not in the best interest of the child. However, some of these decisions are state regulated 删除10：<u>(Weise et al . 2017 )</u>. Some ethicists believe the decision should be based on the best interests of the child only, while others consider the best interests of the family. In this patient case, either decision was supported by the medical team. When making this type of decision, though, families want reassurance that they will not be abandoned by the healthcare team if they choose a palliative care strategy or do not resuscitate.",

The mother gives the child candy， which temporarily relieves the crying. Throughout the meal， she continues to give him candy every time he cries. The father then yells at the child and takes away the candy because children who cry should not be given candy. The child is upset that his candy has been taken away and begins to throw food across the dining room table.\n\n【2】What defense mechanism is the father using?\n\n【3】The father is using displacement， which is characterized by the transfer of feelings from one object or person to another. In this case， the father's anger at the mother is displaced onto the child.\n\n【4】What defense mechanism is the child using?\n\n【5】The child is acting out， which is characterized by the use of extreme behavior to express a thought or feeling. In this case， the child is so overcome with anger that he cannot simply state， \"I'm angry with you\"； instead， he acts out by throwing food across the table.\n\n【6】What type of reinforcement is the child using on the mother?\n\n【7】This is an example of positive reinforcement， in which the consequences of a response increase the likelihood that the response will recur. Specifically， the child cries because crying makes it more likely the mother will continue to give him candy.\n\n【8】How does negative reinforcement differ from punishment?\n\n【9】In negative reinforcement， a behavior is encouraged or reinforced by the removal of an aversive stimulus(eg， if a mother constantly yells at her child to pick up his toys， he will learn to pick up his toys to avoid mom's yelling). In punishment， behavior is discouraged and reduced by administration of an aversive stimulus (eg， the mother puts the boy in a \"time out\" because he did not pick up his toys).\n\n【10】Which method of conditioning is the father using by removing the reward?\n\n【11】The father is employing extinction， which is the elimination of a behavior by nonreinforcement.

This patient demonstrates several characteristics classic for neurofibromatosis type 1 (also known as von Recklinghausen disease). Potential findings include café au lait spots, two or more neurofibromas, optic glioma, iris hamartomas (Lisch nodules), a positive family history (autosomal dominant inheritance), and a distinctive bony lesion such as sphenoid dysplasia or scoliosis. Patients with this disease generally demonstrate 95% of the criteria by age 8 years and all of the criteria by age 20. These patients are also at increased risk for tumors. The gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 17.  \nAnswer A is incorrect. Bilateral acoustic neuromas are characteristic of neurofibromatosis type 2. It is much less common than type 1 and typically manifests with multiple central nervous system tumors. The NF 2 gene is located on chromosome 22.  \nAnswer B is incorrect. Bilateral renal cell carcinoma occurs in von Hippel-Lindau disease, an autosomal dominant disease that is characterized by hemangioblastomas of the retina, cerebellum, and medulla. About half of patients develop bilateral renal cell carcinomas. The disease is associated with the deletion of the VHL gene located on chromosome 3, which is a tumor suppressor gene.  \nAnswer C is incorrect. Cystic medial necrosis of the aorta leading to aortic insufficiency and dissecting aortic aneurysm is associated with Marfan syndrome, a connective tissue disorder caused by the autosomal dominant inheritance of a defective fibrillin gene.  \nAnswer D is incorrect. Leptomeningeal angioma is associated with Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS), which is a rare congenital vascular disorder of unknown etiology affecting capillary-sized blood vessels. Its characteristic features include angiomas and a facial port-wine stain. Only a small portion of patients with port-wine stains at birth have SWS.",

        "text": "【0】Question: A 51-year-old man with a lengthy history of medication-dependent reflux esophagitis sees his physician for an annual physical examination. Laboratory tests reveal a blood gastrin level three times the upper limit of normal. His physician expresses concern that the patient is at risk of developing atrophic gastritis.

Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that works by covalently binding, and irreversibly inactivating the H <sup class=\"calibre40\">+ </sup> /K <sup class=\"calibre40\">+ </sup> /ATPase on the luminal surface of the gastric parietal cell. Gastrin levels are regulated by a feedback loop. Intragastric acidity stimulates D-cells in the gastric antrum to release somatostatin, which works in a paracrine fashion, binding to G-cells in the gastric antrum and inhibiting gastrin release. PPIs will effectively raise the intragastric pH so that gastrin levels rise two- to four-fold. Omeprazole is associated with atrophic gastritis due to hypergastrinemia. It may also be associated with carcinoid tumors, headaches, and GI disturbances.  \nAnswer A is incorrect . Aluminum hydroxide is an antacid that is not absorbed and thus does not cause systemic adverse effects. It is associated with constipation and hypophosphatemia.  \nAnswer B is incorrect . Bismuth binds to ulcers, providing a physical protective barrier. It has no known adverse effects.  \nAnswer C is incorrect . Cimetidine is an H2 \\-antagonist and is associated with headache, confusion, thrombocytopenia, and inhibition of the CYP450 system. Inhibition of the proton pumps by PPIs such as omeprazole has a greater effect on the intragastric acidity that regulates the gastrin feedback loop than antagonizing the H2 \\-receptors by drugs such as cimetidine.  \nAnswer D is incorrect . Misoprostol is a prostaglandin E1 analog that can be used to prevent NSAID-induced peptic ulcers. It is also used as a medical abortifacient in many countries and is therefore strictly contraindicated in pregnant women.",

No transillumination of the scrotum is present.\n\n| A 17-year-old boy is awakened from his sleep by sudden， sharp scrotal pain. In the emergency department，the patient says he feels nauseous. He reports that the pain is mainly on the left side. On physicalexamination， he is afebrile， and there is evidence of swelling and reddening of the scrotum. He has anegative cremasteric reflex on the left. No transillumination of the scrotum is present.  |\n| --- |\n| What is the most likely diagnosis? Testicular torsion. Testicular torsion is usually seen in adolescent males aged 16-18 years， although it canalso occur in infancy. Approximately 50% of instances occur during sleep， but it can also occur at rest orwith physical activity. Some patients have repeated episodes that spontaneously resolve (presumablybecause the testis is undergoing repeated torsion and detorsion).  |\n| What signs and symptoms are typically associated with this condition? Symptoms of testicular torsion include the following： ·Sudden， acute onset of pain in the scrotum， often on one side. ·Swelling/reddening of the scrotum. · Abdominal pain. ·Nausea/vomiting. Signs of testicular torsion include the affected side's being higher than the other and horizontal inorientation as well as absent cremasteric reflex.  |\n| What conditions should be included in the differential diagnosis?·Epididymitis should be considered but is not likely here given that signs of systemic infection (eg，fever) are not present nor is there epididymal tenderness or induration. Likewise， no history of sexuallytransmitted disease risk is noted. Notably， if scrotal elevation had relieved pain (Prehn sign)， this wouldhave indicated epididymitis in lieu of torsion. ·Orchitis should be considered but is also not likely in this patient given the lack of fever， lack of bilateraltesticular involvement， and lack of other signs of mumps.TTrauma should be considered but is not likely here given the lack of history consistent with this etiology.·Hydrocele should be considered but again is not likely here because hydroceles rarely present withacute scrotal pain at night； however， when they are reactive hydroceles trom other etiologies， pain maybe present. Additionally， transillumination would be noted on exam. ·Varicocele should be considered but is unlikely in this case because the \"bag of worms\" sign would benoted on exam of the scrotum. ·Hernia should be considered but is also unlikely given that no mass was appreciated on exam.·TTumor should be considered last， but is unlikely because no mass was noted on exam.  |\n| What complications are associated with this condition? Testicular torsion results in the twisting of the spermatic cord， which contains the testicular artery，pampiniform plexus， and vas deferens. The main danger is the twisting of the testicular artery， which cutsoff the blood supply to the testicle. If this is not reversed rapidly， it will result in testicular atrophy andnecrosis. This is a true surgical emergency.  |\n| What is the appropriate treatment for this condition?Manually untwisting the testis will produce immediate and dramatic pain relief if successful. The successof this method can be confirmed by evidence of return of blood flow to the testis on Doppler ultrasound.Even it successful， surgery should be performed to suture the testis in place to prevent repeated torsion.If manual detorsion does not work， emergent surgery must be performed. Treatment must be initiatedwithin 6 hours of presentation to assure viability of the testicle. If it is not treated within 24 hours， there islittle chance of the testicle's viability.  |\n\n【3】little chance of the testicle's viability.",

The remainder of cases are associated with hyperandrogenism, the causes of which are 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> polycystic  删除换行1 ovarian syndrome (PCOS), 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> adrenogenital syndromes (e.g. non-classic congenital adrenal  删除换行1 hyperplasia), 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> androgen-secreting tumours, 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> other causes of hormone overproduction  删除换行1 such as Cushing’s syndrome and 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> drug-induced.\nIn this woman, the main presenting complaints of hirsutism and difficulty conceiving, with  删除换行1 probable anovulation, are consistent with a diagnosis of PCOS. PCOS affects up to 10%  删除换行1 of women of reproductive age and is the underlying factor in around 15–20% of infertility  删除换行1 cases. A diagnosis of PCOS, according to the 2003 Rotterdam PCOS Consensus Group,  删除换行1 can be made with two of the following three findings: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> clinical or biochemical evidence of  删除换行1 androgen excess, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> oligovulation or anovulation and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> polycystic ovaries on ultrasound.\nThe clinical findings in this case are sufficient to meet the first two of these, allowing a putative diagnosis of PCOS to be made.\nWhile the exact pathophysiology of PCOS is unclear, one theory suggests that increased  删除换行1 gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) pulsing leads to increased luteinising hormone \n\n【10】(LH) pulsing, stimulating increased production of androgens by theca cells in the ovary.\nThere is also evidence that women with PCOS have elevated levels of insulin, which is known  删除换行1 to act synergistically with LH to enhance androgen production by theca cells. Further, insulin inhibits synthesis of sex hormone–binding globulin (SHBG) by the liver, thereby increasing the proportion of free testosterone in the blood. These effects of insulin account for the  删除换行1 hyperandrogenaemia in PCOS, which disrupts the normal follicular development process,  删除换行1 leading to anovulation.\nBefore a diagnosis of PCOS can confidently be made, other conditions that produce hyperandrogenism and irregular menstrual cycles need to be excluded. Further investigations that  删除换行1 may be performed to look for other causes include: \n\n【11】•\t Thyroid function (hypothyroidism)\n•\t Serum prolactin (hyperprolactinaemia)\n•\t 24-hour urinary cortisol (Cushing’s syndrome)\n•\t Morning 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels (elevated in non-classic congenital adrenal  删除换行1 hyperplasia)\n•\t Oral glucose tolerance test and growth hormone suppression (acromegaly)\n•\t Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and oestradiol (high and low/normal, respectively, in premature ovarian failure)\nBiochemical investigations may show increased testosterone levels, reduced SHBG, increased \n\n【12】LH and a high LH:FSH ratio. An ovarian ultrasound should be performed to visualise the  删除换行1 ovaries.\nManagement of PCOS is essentially symptomatic. Hirsutism and acne are managed by agents  删除换行1 designed to inhibit hyperandrogenism, such as the combined oral contraceptive pill, antiandrogens (such as cyproterone acetate or spironolactone), and eflornithine hydrochloride, Case 12: Excessive Hair Growth and Infertility 33  删除换行1 as well as laser or electrolysis for hair removal. The presence of chronic anovulation carries  删除换行1 a higher risk of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma, and therefore requires treatment  删除换行1 (typically with the contraceptive pill or cyclical progestogens). Ovulation may be induced  删除换行1 with the use of clomiphene (an oestrogen receptor antagonist at the hypothalamus).PCOS also carries a significant risk for the development of metabolic and cardiovascular disease, including obesity, impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes and accelerated atherosclerosis. The likely pathophysiology behind these is insulin resistance, since women with PCOS  删除换行5 are usually hyperinsulinaemic. These longer-term complications require similar management to type 2 diabetes, with weight reduction and certain antidiabetic agents (metformin  删除换行1 and the thiazolidinediones) forming the mainstay of treatment.\nKEY POINTS \n\n【13】• Hirsutism refers to the excessive growth of hair in a male pattern in women.\n• It may arise from elevated androgen levels or be idiopathic.\n• PCOS is a clinical diagnosis that often presents with hirsutism and oligomenorrhea  删除换行1 or amenorrhoea.\n• The mechanism of hyperandrogenism in PCOS is unclear but may relate to  删除换行1 increased GnRH and LH pulsing.",

Transference occurs when a patient projects feelings from his or her personal life onto a doctor; countertransference takes place when the doctor projects feelings onto the patient. These feelings can be either positive or negative. The patient’s anger at the doctor when her sexual advances are rebuffed is an example of negative transference.  \nAnswer A is incorrect. The doctor being reminded of his aunt by this patient is an example of countertransference.  \nAnswer B is incorrect. The doctor telling the patient that he is uncomfortable is not an example of countertransference or transference.  \nAnswer D is incorrect. The patient dressing up for appointments is positive transference.  \nAnswer E is incorrect. The patient flirting with the doctor is positive transference.

        "text": "【0】Case 37\n\n【1】A 12-year-old boy is brought to the physicians office with right thigh pain and a limp. His mother has noticed him limping for the past week or so. He denies any injury to his leg but says that it hurts some when he plays basketball with his friends. He denies back pain， hip pain， or ankle pain. He occasionally gets some pain in the right knee but does not have any swelling orbruising. He has no signifi-cant medical history， does not take any medications regularly， and otherwise feels fine. On examination，he is an overweight adolescent. His vital signs and a general physical examination are normal. When you have him walk， he has a prominent limp. You note that he seems to keep his weight on his left leg for a greater propor-tion ofhis gait cycle than he does on the right leg. Examination ofhis back reveals a full range of motion， no tenderness， and no muscle spasm. He gets pain in the right hip when it is passively internally rotated. When the hip is passively flexed， there is a noticeable external rotation. There is no thigh muscle atrophy. His right knee and the remainder of his orthopedic examination are normal.\n\n【2】What is the most appropriate test to order first for this patient?\n\n【3】What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【4】What complication could occur ifthis problem is not diagnosed and treated?\n\n【5】37：Summary： An overweight 12-year-old boy presents for evaluation of a limp and thigh pain. There is no history of injury or trauma. He is found to have pain on internal rotation of the hip and his hip externally rotates when passively flexed. He bears weight more on his left leg than his right while walking.1\\. Develop a differential diagnosis of the most likely causes of leg pain and limp-ing in children.\n\n【6】2\\. Know common causes of leg pain and limping in children of different ages.\n\n【7】3\\. Know appropriate examination， laboratory， and radiologic evaluation for the limping child.To understand a limp， it is first important to understand the normal gait. Gait is composed oftwo phases： the\"swing\"and the\"stance\"phases. The stance phase is the weight-bearing phase and accounts for approximately 60%ofthe gait cycle. The swing phase is the non-weight-bearing phase， when the foot lifts off the ground and is propelled forward. The antalgic gait occurs when the stance phase of gait is shortened on the side of pain， usually because of pain during weight bearing. Antalgic gait is the most common type of limp and is the type of gait described in this case.As always， the initial approach should include a good focused history and physi-cal. The clinician should ask questions about recent trauma， onset， and duration of limp， recent illnesses (viral， pharyngitis， rashes， tick bites， diarrhea， urethritis). Past medical history， previous levels of function， and family history of musculoskel-etal disorders can help with diagnosis. Associated symptoms like fever， weight loss， anorexia， or pain are especially important. A key characteristic in the evaluation of the child with a limp is assessing whether there is pain or no pain. In an antalgic gait， the cause of the pain may range from the back to the foot . Therefore， unless there is an obvious source of pain， the examination should include assessment of the back， pelvis， buttock， leg， and foot. In the child who clings to the parent， separating the child from the parent will allow the clinician to observe the child’s gait when they walk back to the parent. The child who walks stiffly may be avoiding moving the spine indicating a possible discitis. Those with nonantalgic gait abnormalities (Trendelenburg gait， inability to dorsiflex the foot， locked knees， toe walking) can have congenital， neurologic， or limb length disor-ders. Inspecting the feet may show clawing of the toes or cavus deformity， which are signs of neuromuscular conditions.\n\n【8】Because hip pathology often presents with vague pain and hip conditions are likely to need emergent treatment， evaluation of the hip may be the most important part of the examination of a patient in whom the site of pathology is not immediately obvious. Restricted internal rotation appears to be the most sensitive marker of hip pathology in children， followed by a lack of abduction. Internal rotation of the hip increases the intracapsular pressure within the acetabulum. Pain during a leg roll (supine child with extended hip and knee； one examiner stabilizes the pel-vis while another rolls leg internally and externally) and limited internal rotation of less than 30 degrees may indicate infectious or orthopedic hip pathology.

An ultrasound of the hip is more sensitive for an effusion of the hip and can be considered. In nonverbal children， x-rays from hip to feet can find a fracture in a significant minority of children with limp. A complete blood count(CBC) should be drawn if there is concern of an infection， inflammatory arthritis， or malignancy. An erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein(CRP) should be considered in evaluating infectious and rheumatologic etiologies. Consider Lyme disease in endemic areas， as this can mimic both infectious and rheumatologic causes of hip disorders. If there was a recent pharyngitis， consider antistreptolysin (ASO) titers. In teens with history of urethritis or febrile diarrhea， consider urine chlamydial antigens or stool cultures for possible Reiter syndrome. Any joint where septic arthritis is considered should have a joint aspiration and evaluation of synovial fluid.

Testing of the fluid should include culture for gonorrhea in teens that are sexually active.\n\n【11】The evaluation of limping without pain  should include measure-ments for leg length discrepancies (measure umbilicus to medial malleolus) and observation for muscular atrophy or limb deformity. Barlow (hip and knee flexed90 degrees， hold the knee and attempt to displace the thigh posterior)， Ortolani(guided abduction)，and Galeazzi (knee height discrepancy when patient lies supine with ankles to buttocks and hips and knees flexed) tests can be used to assess for congenital hip abnormalities and femoral length discrepancies.Common causes of limping in children in this age group are septic arthritis， frac-tures， and complications of congenital hip dysplasia. Septic arthritis is usually monoarticular and associated with systemic signs such as fever. In young infants， the symptoms may be less obvious， such as crying， irritability， and poor feeding. Children who are ambulatory (crawlers or walkers) will often refuse to do anything that puts weight on the affected joint because of pain. Infection of a joint causes a septic effusion， which raises the pressure inside of the joint capsule. Children with a septic hip joint will often lay with their hip flexed，abducted， and externally rotated， which helps to reduce the pain， and they will have significant pain with any internal rotation or extension of the joint. Children with a septic joint will usually have an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count，ESR， and CRP. Definitive diagnosis comes from joint aspiration. Any suspected septic joint must be aspirated. In younger infants (4 months or younger)， group B Streptococcus and Staphylococcus aureus are the most common pathogens involved. In older infants and children under the age of 5， S aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes are the usual causes. Treatment is urgent surgical irrigation and debridement， along with antibiotics.\n\n【12】Unsuspected fractures—either stress fractures or traumatic fractures—can present with pain and limping. Abuse must be suspected if the injury is inconsis-tent with the history presented， ifthe history changes with repeated questioning， if the child is said to have performed an act outside of his developmental ability， or if a fracture usually associated with abuse is found 删除25：<u></u>.

A traumatic injury may not result in limping or in complete immobility， but may cause a change in how the child ambulates. For example， a child who previously walked and now refuses to walk but will crawl， may have an injury of the lower leg or foot.Transient synovitis is a self-limited inflammatory response that is a common cause of hip pain in children. It occurs typically in children ages 3 to 10， is more common in boys than in girls， and often follows a viral infection. It is frequently seen as gradu-ally increasing hip pain that results in a limp or refusal to walk. These children have a low-grade or no fever， a normal W BC count， and a normal ESR. On examination， there is pain with internal rotation of the hip and the overall range of motion is limited by pain. X-rays are either normal or show some nonspecific swelling. In a situation where the patient is afebrile， has pain-free rotation of hip greater than30 degrees， has a normal W BC count， normal ESR， CRP， and short-term follow-up can be assured， the patient can be followed clinically and should improve in a few days. If these conditions are not met and the diagnosis of a septic joint is considered， or if a patient followed expectantly continues to worsen， an aspiration should be done. Kocher criteria are often utilized to assess risk for septic arthritis 删除换行1 in children. The four criteria are fever greater than 101.3F (38.5℃)，non-weight-bearing， ESR greater than 40， W BC count greater than 12，000. Z ero criteria pres-ent equals less than 0.2% risk， one criteria is 3%， two criteria is 40%， three criteria is 93%， and four criteria is almost 100% chance of septic arthritis. A septic joint will have a purulent aspirate with a WBC count greater than 50，000/pL； transient synovi-tis will have a yellow/ clear aspirate with a lower WBC count (<10，000/pL).\n\n【14】Legg-Calve-Perthes (LCP) disease is an avascular necrosis of the femoral head that typically occurs in children ages 4 to 8. It is much more common in boys than in girls. Any disruption of blood flow to the femoral capital epiphysis， such as trauma or infection， may cause avascular necrosis. In LCP disease， the etiology of the disruption of blood flow is unknown. Children typically have a gradual onset of hip，thigh， or knee pain， and limping over a few months. Early in the course， x-rays of the hip may appear normal. Later radiographic findings include collapse， flatten-ing， and widening of the femoral head. Bone scans or magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis. The treatment is usually conser-vative， with protection of the joint and efforts to maintain range of motion. Chil-dren who develop more severe necrosis or who develop the disease at older ages may have a worse outcome and a higher risk of developing degenerative arthritis.The capital femoral epiphysis is the growth plate that connects the metaphysis(femoral head) to the diaphysis (shaft of the femur). A slipped capital femoral epiphysis is a separation of this growth plate， which results in the femoral head being medially and posteriorly displaced. This may be caused by an acute injury， but more often is not. It is most often seen in overweight adolescent boys and presents as pain in the hip， thigh， or knee along with a limp. Examination reveals limited internal rotation and obligate external rotation when the hip is passively flexed. Early x-rays may show only widening of the epiphysis； later x-rays can show the slippage of the femoral head in relation to the femoral neck. The treatment is surgical pin-ning of the femoral head. These patients must be closely followed， as approximately20% to 50% will develop avascular necrosis and 33% will develop SCFE in the contralateral hip.\n\n【15】Other causes of limb pain are common in adolescents. Sprains， strains， and over-use injuries are the most common cause of limb pain in this population， and are usually readily diagnosed on history and examination 删除25：<u></u>. Sexually active adolescents or teens are at risk for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and their complications， including gonococcal arthritis. In this population， an appropriate history， sexual history， and review of systems are necessary.Septic arthritis， fractures， neuromuscular disorders， and neoplasms can cause a limp in children of all ages. Night sweats， anorexia， weight loss， and pain that wak-ens the child at night are suspicious for malignancy. “Growing pains\"is a diagnosis of exclusion. It should be considered if the pain is only at night， is bilateral， is not present during the day， and if no other pathology is found.",

PML is an opportunistic infection caused by polyomavirus JC， leading to demyelination of the CNS that causes gradually progressive neurologic deficits. Radiographically， there is no mass effect. The lesions are generally bilateral， asymmetric， nonenhancing， and peri-ventricular or subcortical in distribution. This late-stage HIV infection is based on a CD4 cell count <100/pL The presence of thrush in this patient has a high-risk status for AIDS-related opportunistic infections. He also has focal neurologic signs and an MRI that shows multiple white matter lesions without mass effect involving the right lateral frontal， right frontoparietal， and left frontal lobes and cerebellum. A PCR analysis is positive for polyomavirus JC. The gold standard for diagnosis of PML is a brain biopsy but with the prepon-derance of evidence supporting a diagnosis of PML， a biopsy can be deferred. If HAART is administered， 50% of AIDS patients will survive PML. Neurologic deficits typically persist in survivors. In patients with HIV infection and CD4cell counts <200/pL， localized or focal encephalitis is the most common pre sentation of toxoplasmosis and is the most common CNS system mass lesion. A negative serologic test for toxoplasma-specific IgM would add additional support to the exclusion of toxoplasmic encephalitis. CNS lymphoma occurs in approximately 2% to 12% of HIV-infected individuals. It is strongly associ-ated with Epstein-Barr virus infection. In patients with AIDS， lymphoma was second only to toxoplasmosis as the most common CNS mass lesion.\n\n【14】17.2B. Risk factors for listerial meningitis include immunosuppression， neonatal status or age >50 years， alcoholism， malignancy， diabetes mellitus， hepatic failure， renal failure， iron overload， CVDs， and HIV infection. The most appropriate empiric therapy is ampicillin (the drug of choice for Listeria)， with ceftriaxone and/or vancomycin. The CSF fluid supports a diagnosis of men-ingitis. Empiric vancomycin and ceftriaxone are recommended for the treat-ment of meningitis in patients 2 to 50 years of age. This covers S. pneumoniae and N. meningitidis， the most common organisms responsible for meningitis in this age group. The analysis of CSF in patients with listerial meningitis often fails to reveal typical gram-positive rods with characteristic“tumbling motil-ity”in wet mount preparations， but often shows pleocytosis and may demon-strate a significant number of lymphocytes in addition to neutrophils. Patients usually have 1 CSF protein levels；J CSF glucose levels are found less com-monly and less profoundly with listerial meningitis. The fluoroquinolones may be effective but do not penetrate the CNS well. Gentamicin is synergistic with ampicillin despite poor CNS penetration.\n\n【15】CLINICAL PEARLS\n\n【16】Meningitis has a high morbidity and mortality rate， especially in high-risk patients.\n\n【17】LP and CNS imaging are central to the diagnosis of meningitis and encephalitis.\n\n【18】Each year 20，000 cases ofencephalitis occur in the United States， with the predominant sporadic cause being HSV and the most common epidemic cause being WNV.\n\n【19】PML is caused by polyomavirus JC， with demyelination of the CNS and neurologic deficits.\n\n【20】If HART is administered， 50% of patients with AIDS and PML will survive the latter disease.\n\n【21】HSV is the most common cause of fatal sporadic encephalitis in the United States.\n\n【22】HSV encephalitis has fever， headache， seizures， focal neurologic signs， and impaired multiple sclerosis (MS).",

In any  删除换行1 case of dissociative disorder, the diagnosis is one of exclusion; in this case the neurological  删除换行1 examination excludes organic lesions. It is important to realize that this disorder is distinct  删除换行1 from malingering and factitious disease. The condition is real to patients, and they must not  删除换行1 be told that they are faking illness or wasting the time of staff.\n\n【14】The management is to explain the dissociation—in this case it is between her will to move  删除换行1 her leg and its failure to respond—as being due to stress, and that there is no underlying  删除换行1 serious disease such as multiple sclerosis. A very positive attitude that she will recover is  删除换行1 essential, and it is important to reinforce this with appropriate physical treatment, in this  删除换行1 case physiotherapy.\n\n【15】The prognosis in cases of recent onset is good, and this patient made a complete recovery in  删除换行1 8 days.\n\n【16】Dissociative disorder frequently presents with neurological symptoms, and the commonest  删除换行1 of these are convulsions, blindness, pain and amnesia. Clearly some of these will require full  删除换行1 neurological investigation to exclude organic disease.\n\n【17】KEY POINTS\n\n【18】•\t Dissociative disorder frequently presents as a neurological illness.\n\n【19】•\t The diagnosis of dissociative disorder must be one of exclusion.",

        "text": "【0】Question: A 56-year-old man who is a health care worker presents to his physician with vague abdominal discomfort. A physical examination reveals a tender liver, palpable to 6 cm below the costal margin and scleral icterus. His laboratory studies are significant for an aspartate aminotransferase activity of 200 U/L and an alanine aminotransferase activity of 450 U/L. CT of the abdomen shows a dominant solid nodule in the liver. The tumor marker most likely to be increased in this patient is also likely to be elevated in which of the following malignancies?\n\n【1】> (A) Choriocarcinoma\n\n【2】> (B) Colorectal carcinoma\n\n【3】> (C) Melanoma\n\n【4】> (D) Neuroblastoma\n\n【5】> (E) Prostatic carcinoma\n\n【6】> (F) Yolk sac carcinoma\n\n【7】 Answer: The correct answer is F . This vignette suggests a hepatoma (hepatocellular carcinoma), which is associated with an elevated α-fetoprotein level. Hepatomas are highly associated with chronic HBV and HCV infections. Other risk factors include Wilson disease, hemochromatosis, alcoholic cirrhosis, α1 \\-antitrypsin deficiency, and exposure to toxins and carcinogens such as aflatoxin. α-Fetoprotein is a marker for hepatomas, but levels can also be elevated in patients with germ cell tumors, such as yolk sac tumors. Yolk sac tumors (also known as endodermal sinus tumors) arise from the germ cells that eventually become the adult gonads. Yolk sac tumors are the most common malignant testicular and ovarian tumors in children. Remember, tumor markers should not be used to make the primary diagnosis, but for confirmation and to monitor the response to therapy.  \nAnswer A is incorrect . The marker for choriocarcinoma is β-hCG. This marker is also elevated with hydatidiform moles and gestational trophoblastic tumors. Hepatomas are not known to elevate β-hCG levels.  \nAnswer B is incorrect . The marker for colorectal carcinoma is carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). This marker is nonspecific and is also produced by pancreatic, gastric, and breast carcinomas. Most tumors of endoderm origin can release CEA excluding hepatomas. However, secondary tumors in the liver from malignant colon cancer may also present with increased CEA levels.  \nAnswer C is incorrect . The marker for melanoma is S-100. This marker also is elevated with neuroendocrine tumors such as astrocytomas and even carcinoid tumors. Hepatomas are not known to elevate S-100 levels.  \nAnswer D is incorrect . The marker for neuroblastoma is bombesin. This marker also is elevated with lung and gastric cancers. Hepatomas are not known to elevate bombesin levels.  \nAnswer E is incorrect . The marker for prostatic carcinoma is prostate-specific antigen. Hepatomas are not known to elevate prostatespecific antigen levels.",

During physical examination, the physician notices numerous acne-like papules on the patient’s face. Echocardiography shows significant left ventricular outflow obstruction. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis for this patient’s heart condition?\n\n【1】> (A) Dilated cardiomyopathy\n\n【2】> (B) Lipoma\n\n【3】> (C) Myxoma\n\n【4】> (D) Rhabdomyoma\n\n【5】> (E) Transposition of the great vessels\n\n【6】 Answer: The correct answer is D . Tuberous sclerosis is a genetic condition (autosomal dominant) characterized by nodular proliferation of multinucleated atypical astrocytes. These form tubers, which are found throughout the cerebral cortex and periventricular areas. The classic triad, which is manifest in only the most severe of cases, consists of seizures, mental retardation, and facial angiofibromas (also known as adenoma sebaceum). Half of patients with tuberous sclerosis develop rhabdomyomas, primary tumors of cardiac muscle that, although benign, may compromise cardiac function, especially of the atrioventricular valves. Tuberous sclerosis is also notable for a link to angiomyolipomas of the kidney.  \nAnswer A is incorrect . Dilated cardiomyopathy is often idiopathic. It involves four-chamber hypertrophy and dilation, and eventually heart failure. This condition is not associated with tuberous sclerosis. Note that hypertrophic cardiomyopathy also causes ventricular outflow obstruction and is often responsible for sudden death in young athletes.  \nAnswer B is incorrect . Lipomas, like rhabdomyomas, are capable of obstruction. These can create ball-valve obstructions and are most often located in the left ventricle, right atrium, or atrial septum. However, in conjunction with the history suggesting tuberous sclerosis, lipoma is a less likely diagnosis.  \nAnswer C is incorrect . Myxomas, like rhabdomyomas, are capable of obstruction. However, these are seen in adults and are often located in the atria.  \nAnswer E is incorrect . Transposition of the great vessels is a situation in which the pulmonary trunk arises from the left ventricle and the aorta arises from the right ventricle. This arrangement is incompatible with life, and a compensatory anomaly such as a patent ductus arteriosus is necessary.",

He is otherwise well but felt feverish on the morning of his admission. There is no history of trauma and the systems enquiry is unremarkable. Past medical history includes left ventricular failure, hypertension and renal  删除换行1 impairment. Current medications are aspirin, furosemide and ramipril. He lives alone,  删除换行1 smokes 15 cigarettes per day and drinks 30 units of alcohol per week.\n\n【3】Examination\n\n【4】This man is uncomfortable but well. His temperature is 37.1°C, pulse 110/min and blood  删除换行1 pressure 145/83 mmHg. General examination is unremarkable, but his right knee is warm  删除换行1 with a tense effusion.

Crystal arthropathy  删除换行1 such as gout is more common than septic arthritis; and since this patient is well with no  删除换行1 discernible risk factors for sepsis, it is the most likely diagnosis here. The investigation of  删除换行1 choice is a prompt aspiration of the joint with assessment of the synovial fluid for crystals  删除换行1 or bacteria (and if the latter are detected, culture to determine the causative organism and  删除换行1 its sensitivity to antibiotics).\n\n【20】Crystal arthropathy is caused by either uric acid (gout) or pyrophosphate (pseudogout) crystals precipitating out into the synovial fluid, generating a brisk inflammatory  删除换行1 response. The classic clinical picture is discrete attacks of monoarticular inflammation \n\n【21】– often initially the metatarsophalangeal joint – followed by asymptomatic periods; in  删除换行1 more severe, longstanding cases, the disease can become polyarticular. Risk factors for  删除换行1 gout are under-excretion or over-production of urate, which is a product of DNA breakdown and present in large amounts in certain foods and alcohol. Urate crystals may also  删除换行1 deposit in the skin, causing painful discrete lumps known as tophi, or in the renal tract,  删除换行1 causing urate nephropathy or lithiasis.\n Causes of over-production and under-excretion of urate\n\n【22】Over-production Under-excretion\n\n【23】Excess alcohol\n\n【24】High consumption of meat and shellfish Renal impairment\n\n【25】Chemotherapy Loop diuretics\n\n【26】Haematological malignancy Low-dose aspirin\n\n【27】Psoriasis\n\n【28】Investigations will reveal an elevated acute-phase response, often with a neutrophilia and  删除换行1 thrombocytosis due to the inflammatory response (although this can lead to diagnostic  删除换行1 confusion with septic arthritis). The urate level may be normal during an acute attack  删除换行1 and is therefore relatively unhelpful. Microscopy of the synovial fluid will reveal needleshaped crystals that are negatively birefringent on polarized microscopy in cases of gout,  删除换行1 and positively birefringent brick-shaped crystals in pyrophosphate disease. It is worth  删除换行1 bearing in mind that crystals can occur as innocent bystanders in infection; so unless the  删除换行1 diagnosis is clear-cut, it is worth sending a synovial fluid sample for culture. In chronic  删除换行1 disease, X-rays may reveal the classic punched-out erosions with sclerotic margins.\nOsteopenia is characteristically absent. Pyrophosphate arthropathy may be associated  删除换行1 with radiological evidence of chondrocalcinosis.\n\n【29】Treatment of an acute attack includes anti-inflammatories such as non-steroidal antiinflammatories (NSAIDs), colchicine or steroids, depending on the patient’s comorbidities.\nIn this case, for example, the renal impairment is a relative contraindication for NSAIDs,  删除换行1 so low-dose colchicine or a short course of oral prednisolone might be appropriate.Injection of the affected joint with corticosteroid and local anaesthetic will also offer  删除换行1 immediate and effective relief and should be offered to all patients in whom there is  删除换行1 no evidence of septic disease. In cases of gout, patients should be given lifestyle advice  删除换行1 which can have a huge effect on urate levels (e.g. reducing alcohol and meat intake) and,  删除换行1 where possible, offending medications should be stopped or switched to alternatives with  删除换行1 no impact on urate handling. Long-term treatment with urate-lowering therapy such as  删除换行1 allopurinol should be commenced if the patient experiences recurrent attacks, but its 179 删除换行5 Rheumatology 删除换行1 commencement can precipitate another gout attack and should be started only when an  删除换行1 acute attack is over and under anti-inflammatory cover. There is no long-term prophylaxis for pyrophosphate disease.\n\n【30】KEY POINTS\n\n【31】• Crystal arthropathy is a common cause of an acutely painful joint (but always consider  删除换行1 and rule out septic arthritis).\n\n【32】• Gout may be precipitated by diuretics, renal impairment and aspirin use, so is a  删除换行1 common clinical problem in general medicine.\n\n【33】• Diagnosis is based on identification of urate crystals in synovial fluid; serum levels may  删除换行1 be normal.\n\n【34】• Acute treatment relies on NSAIDS, colchicine or steroids.\n\n【35】• Lifestyle modification may prevent further attacks. If not, commence allopurinol under  删除换行1 anti-inflammatory cover.删除6：<u>This page intentionally left blank 181</u>\n\n【36】删除测试2：<u>Rheumatology\n\n【37】</u>",

After the impact he complained of pain  删除换行1 in the superior aspect of his right knee. An ambulance came to the scene and took him  删除换行1 to the emergency department.\n\n【3】Examination\n\n【4】This elderly man has a closed injury and swelling in the distal aspect of the femur and  删除换行1 knee. He has some obvious tenderness to palpation around the distal femur.

The anteroposterior and lateral X-rays  删除换行1 show multiple fracture lines within the distal femur consistent with a shortened and  删除换行1 displaced fracture. These injuries make up 6 per cent of all femoral fractures. There is  删除换行1 a bimodal distribution of fractures based on age and gender. Most high-energy distal  删除换行1 femur fractures occur in males aged between 15 and 50 years, while most low-energy  删除换行1 fractures occur in osteoporotic women aged 50 or above. The most common high-energy  删除换行1 mechanism of injury is a road traffic accident (RTA), and the most common low-energy  删除换行1 mechanism is a fall.\nDepending on the mechanism of injury, radiographic evaluation of distal femur fractures  删除换行1 may include orthogonal plain radiographs of the entire length of the femur to avoid  删除换行1 missing ipsilateral femoral neck or shaft fractures. True knee radiographs are required  删除换行1 to screen for intra-articular extension of fracture lines. If intra-articular extension is  删除换行1 suspected – particularly coronal plane fractures which can be difficult to see on plain  删除换行5 X-rays – a CT scan may be helpful in planning treatment.\n\n【12】In general, however, non-operative treatment does not work well for displaced fractures.\nWith this patient, operative treatment is indicated. Operative intervention is also indicated in the presence of open fractures and injuries associated with vascular injury. The  删除换行1 aim of surgery is to achieve anatomical reduction of the joint surface with stable fixation,  删除换行1 restoration of limb alignment, and early postoperative movement of the knee joint. This  删除换行1 patient should have an open reduction and internal fixation with a plate and screws.\n\n【13】Multiple options exist for the definitive treatment of distal femur fractures. They include  删除换行1 external fixation (for patients with open fractures and bone loss, vascular injury, associated significant soft-tissue injuries, or extensive comminution), intramedullary nailing  删除换行1 (for fractures with enough intact distal femur to allow for interlocking screw fixation),  删除换行1 and plate osteosynthesis with either open reduction and internal fixation or minimally  删除换行1 invasive plate osteosynthesis. Likewise, multiple plating options are available and include  删除换行1 conventional buttress plates, fixed-angle devices, and locking plates. Locked implants  删除换行1 are typically indicated in patients with osteoporosis, fractures with metaphyseal comminution where the medial cortex cannot be restored, or a short articular segment. Total  删除换行1 knee replacement is effective in elderly patients with articular fractures and significant  删除换行1 osteoporosis, or pre-existing arthritis that is not amenable to open reduction and internal  删除换行1 fixation.\n\n【14】Low-demand elderly patients with non- or minimally displaced fractures can be managed conservatively. The techniques comprise either skeletal traction or initial splinting  删除换行1 and mobilization with limited weight-bearing and eventual progression to either a cast  删除换行1 or functional brace. Radiographs should be obtained at weekly to bi-weekly intervals for  删除换行1 the first 6 weeks to ensure that the fracture reduction is maintained. The patient should  删除换行1 gradually progress to weight-bearing, and joint mobilization should be allowed based on  删除换行1 the clinical and radiographic progression of fracture healing. In general, this fracture can  删除换行1 take a minimum of 3–4 months to unite.删除个例：<u>Orthopaedics</u>\nKEY POINTS\n\n【15】• High-energy distal femur fractures occur in males aged between 15 and 50 years. Most  删除换行1 low-energy fractures occur in osteoporotic women over the age of 50 years.\n\n【16】• Shortening of the fracture with varus and extension of the distal articular segment is the  删除换行1 typical deformity.\n\n【17】• Radiographic evaluation of distal femur fractures may include orthogonal plain  删除换行1 radiographs.\n\n【18】• Low-demand elderly patients with non- or minimally displaced fractures can be  删除换行1 managed conservatively.\n\n【19】• The aim of surgery in displaced fractures is to achieve anatomical reduction of the  删除换行1 joint surface with stable fixation, restoration of limb alignment, and early postoperative  删除换行1 movement of the knee joint.删除6：<u>This page intentionally left blank 35</u>\n删除个例：<u>Orthopaedics</u>",

The baby is taken to the neonatal unit for further evaluation. He was born  删除换行1 at term by emergency caesarean section for undiagnosed breech presentation. There was no  删除换行1 prolonged rupture of membranes. The pregnancy had been unremarkable to that point and  删除换行1 all antenatal scans had been normal. Mother’s blood group is O+, had negative HIV, hepatitis B  删除换行5 and syphilis serology and was rubella immune. The delivery was attended by a paediatrician  删除换行1 but the baby cried immediately and needed no resuscitation. His birth weight was 3.5  kg  删除换行1 (50th centile) and the first-day check was unremarkable. He has been breast-fed and although  删除换行1 there were problems latching on initially, he fed well on day 2. He seems rather sleepy and has  删除换行1 had frequent non-bilious vomits today. His mother is a 23-year-old woman from Pakistan  删除换行1 who speaks good English and this is her first baby.\n\n【2】Examination\n\n【3】The baby’s temperature is 36.3°C, his heart rate is 160 beats/min and his respiratory rate is  删除换行1 70 breaths/min. Oxygen saturation is 99 per cent in air, capillary refill is 2–3 s and blood pressure is 60/40 mmHg. There is subcostal and mild sternal recession. He responds to vigorous  删除换行1 stimulation and pain, but otherwise is very lethargic. The chest is clear, heart sounds and  删除换行1 femoral pulses are normal and the abdomen is normal. The fontanelle is normotensive. He  删除换行1 has a strong odour, which is slightly unpleasant.\n\n【4】Investigations\n\n【5】 Normal\n\n【6】 Venous blood gas analysis 删除换行1  pH 6.98 7.35–7.42\n\n【7】 Pco2 2.62 4.7–6.0 kPa\n\n【8】 Base excess −25.5 +2.5 to −2.5 mmol/L\n\n【9】 Lactate 2.1 1.0–1.8 mmol/L\n\n【10】 Glucose 5.2 2.2–4.4 mmol/L\n\n【11】Urinalysis\n\n【12】 Glucose Negative Negative\n\n【13】 Protein Negative Negative\n\n【14】 Ketones +++ Negative\n\n【15】Questions\n\n【16】• What are the possible causes of this type of presentation?\n\n【17】• How do you interpret the blood gas analysis?\n\n【18】• What is the most likely cause in this case?\n\n【19】• What is the emergency management?\n\n【20】ANSWER 85\n\n【21】The history describes a term neonate who became very ill over a short period of time. The  删除换行1 important diagnoses to consider are discussed in Case 10.\n Approach to blood gas interpretation\n\n【22】In this case\n\n【23】Look at the pH pH <7.35, acidosis\n\n【24】Look at the Pco2 Pco2 < 4.7 kPa, respiratory compensation\n\n【25】Look at the base excess Lower than −2.5, metabolic acidosis\n\n【26】The blood gas analysis shows a severe metabolic acidosis with unsuccessful respiratory compensation. This fits with the clinical picture of a tachypnoeic baby.\n\n【27】Important points to note are the absence of risk factors for sepsis, the absence of signs of  删除换行1 circulatory compromise, a lethargic baby with a strong odour, ketonuria and a severe metabolic acidosis without significant hyperlactataemia or hypoglycaemia. These findings point  删除换行1 to an inborn error of metabolism, where excess acid is accumulating in the blood due to a  删除换行1 metabolic defect. Possible causes include propionic, methylmalonic and isovaleric acidaemias. Remembering the names is less important than recognizing this type of presentation.\n\n【28】Emergency management consists of stopping feeds and starting an infusion of 10 per cent  删除换行1 dextrose. Whilst sepsis is unlikely to be the sole cause of the illness, it could be a contributing factor and antibiotics should be administered. The baby needs to be assessed promptly by  删除换行1 an experienced paediatrician as he is likely to require intubation and ventilation if he starts  删除换行1 to tire or cannot protect his airway. It is likely that sodium bicarbonate would be beneficial  删除换行1 to partially correct the acidosis, and the case should be discussed urgently with the regional  删除换行1 paediatric metabolic centre, as specific therapies may be recommended even before a certain  删除换行1 diagnosis is available. To assist in making a diagnosis, blood should be sent for ammonia,  删除换行1 plasma amino acid profile, and urine for amino and organic acid profiles.\n\n【29】This baby had consanguineous parents (first cousins), increasing the risk of an autosomal  删除换行1 recessive inborn error of metabolism. He required intubation and ventilation until the acidosis was corrected and he was then transferred to the regional metabolic unit. The diagnosis  删除换行1 turned out to be isovaleric acidaemia.\n\n【30】Key Points\n\n【31】• Metabolic disease can present as a sudden deterioration in the neonatal period.\n\n【32】• Metabolic disease is rare and management must be discussed with an expert.",

A 56-year-old diabetic woman with urinary tract obstruction\n\n【5】Answer: 3.1 C. Muscarinic cholinoreceptor antagonists with quaternary amine groups do not penetrate the CNS and are therefore unlikely to impair memory. By blocking gastrointestinal motility, these agents can cause increased retention of infecting organisms.\n\n【6】Question: 3.2 A 16-year-old teenager is going on his first deep sea fishing trip and is using a scopolamine patch to ward off sea sickness. Which of the following is the most likely adverse effect he will experience?\n\n【7】A. Bradycardia\n\n【8】B. Drowsiness\n\n【9】C. Miosis\n\n【10】D. Urinary urgency\n\n【11】Answer: 3.2 B. Scopolamine penetrates the CNS and can cause drowsiness and sedation. It also can cause mydriasis, tachycardia, and urinary retention.\n\n【12】Question: 3.3 Cholinergic excess resulting from organophosphate insecticide poisoning can be treated with which of the following?\n\n【13】A. Atropine\n\n【14】B. Digoxin\n\n【15】C. Ipratropium bromide\n\n【16】D. Tropicamide\nAnswer: 3.3 A. Atropine is a tertiary amine that can penetrate the CNS. In addition to its peripheral blocking actions, it can also block the adverse CNS effects as a result of cholinergic excess. Tropicamide is also a tertiary amine. However, it has a very short duration of action and would be an unsuitable antidote. Ipratropium bromide is a charged quaternary ammonium compound that does not penetrate the CNS.\n\n【17】PHARMACOLOGY PEARLS\n\n【18】 Many antihistaminic agents, antipsychotic agents, and antidepressant agents have muscarinic cholinoreceptor antagonist (antimuscarinic) activity.\n\n【19】 Scopolamine is a tertiary amine and has ready access to the CNS when administered parenterally, whereas quaternary amine antimuscarinic agents, such as ipratropium bromide, have limited access to the CNS.\n\n【20】 Scopolamine can cause drowsiness and sedation, as well as mydriasis, tachycardia, and urinary retention.\n\n【21】 Cholinoreceptor agonists cause symptoms of SLUD— s alivation, l acrimation, u rination, d iarrhea—whereas cholinoreceptor antagonists have the opposite effects—dry mouth, dry eyes, urinary retention, constipation.\n\n【22】#",

        "text": "【0】METASTATIC CARCINOMA\n\n【1】(i) Site.— It is in the parotid region.\n\n【2】(ii) Temperature and tenderness.— The overlying  删除换行1 skin may be somewhat warm. When the skin is infiltrated  删除换行1 it may look reddish-blue. Tenderness is usually not present.\n\n【3】(iii) Size and shape.— Carcinoma is usually of big  删除换行1 size as it grows bigger within a short time. It may be of  删除换行1 any shape.\n\n【4】(iv) Surface.— It is irregular.\n\n【5】(v) Consistency.— The mass is usually hard, but  删除换行1 may be firm.\n\n【6】(vi) Fixity.— The swelling is often fixed to deeper  删除换行1 structures. When the masseter is made taut by clenching  删除换行1 the teeth, the swelling becomes fixed and cannot be  删除换行1 moved along the line of the fibres of the masseter. But  删除换行1 slight sideways movement may be present- The skin may  删除换行1 be free but a few carcinomas show a tendency to infiltrate  删除换行1 the skin. In that case the skin cannot be lifted up off  删除换行1 the tumour.\n\n【7】(vii) Regional lymph nodes are often enlarged and 删除换行1 hard.\n\n【8】(viii) Facial nerve is often involved by carcinoma of  删除换行1 the parotid. This will lead to paralysis of the facial  删除换行1 muscles.\n\n【9】(ix) General examination.— In case of few  删除换行1 carcinomas, blood-borne metastasis may be present  删除换行1 particularly to the lungs.\n\n【10】Special Investigations.—\n\n【11】(a) FNAC can be performed to confirm the  删除换行1 diagnosis.\n\n【12】(b) CT Scan of the parotid region may be 删除换行1 performed to know the tumour extent.\n\n【13】Treatment.— SURGERY is the main treatment,  删除换行1 though a few carcinomas like squamous cell carcinoma  删除换行1 and cylindroma recurrences may be treated by  删除换行1 radiotherapy.\n\n【14】(i) Total parotidectomy with sacrifice of the facial  删除换行1 nerve should be the treatment of choice particularly in  删除换行1 cases of low grade malignant lesion such as acinar cell  删除换行1 adenocarcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma and low grade  删除换行1 mucoepidermoid carcinoma.\n\n【15】(ii) In case of high grade malignant lesions e.g. 删除换行2 high grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma, undifferentiated  删除换行1 carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma radical neck  删除换行1 dissection should be accompanied by complete  删除换行1 parotidectomy.\n\n【16】(iii) In a few cases of low grade malignant lesion  删除换行1 one may try to save the facial nerve while performing  删除换行1 total parotidectomy, though technically it is difficult.\n\n【17】(iv) Local recurrences should be treated with  删除换行1 radiotherapy.\n\n【18】(v) When complete removal is not possible,  删除换行1 superficial parotidectomy with radium implantation should  删除换行1 be the treatment of choice.\n\n【19】(vi) When the tumour is completely fixed and  删除换行1 irremovable only palliative deep X-ray threapy may be  删除换行1 advised.\n\n【20】RADIATION THERAPY.— If the surgeon feels that  删除换行1 there is residual cancer after radical resection, or if the  删除换行1 pathologists report 'cancer is extending to the margin of  删除换行1 the resection', in such cases postoperative cobalt therapy  删除换行1 should be initiated as soon as satisfactory wound healing  删除换行1 has been obtained.\n\n【21】Other advanced parotid cancers that are clearly nonresectable may be controlled for many months by  删除换行1 appropriate X-ray therapy.\n\n【22】CHEMOTHERAPY.— In occasional circumstances,  删除换行1 methotrexate or 5-fluorouracil therapy may cause limited  删除换行1 regression of malignant neoplasms of the parotid or  删除换行1 submandibular gland. But its efficacy is not established  删除换行1 for long term palliation. Infusion with cyclophosphamide  删除换行1 (Cycloxan or Endoxan) through retrograde catheter into  删除换行1 the superficial temporal artery has produced marked  删除换行1 regression in certain cases of advanced parotid carcinoma.\n\n【23】MIKULICZ'S DISEASE AND SJOGREN’S\n\n【24】CARCINOMA OF THE PAROTID GLAND\n\n【25】MIKULICZ'S DISEASE is characterised by an  删除换行1 asymptomatic swelling of all or a combination of parotid,  删除换行1 submandibular and lacrymal glands. The disease can beginSALIVARY GLANDS 81 删除换行1 and remain in one gland for quite a long time.\nEnlargement of the lacrimal glands will cause bulge below  删除换行1 the outer ends of the eyelids and narrowing of the  删除换行1 palpebral fissures. It also causes dryness of the mouth.\n\n【26】SJOGREN’S SYNDROME is all the above conditions,  删除换行1 plus (i) dry eyes (Keratoconjunctivitis sicca), dry mouth  删除换行1 (xerostomia) and rheumatoid arthritis. Other connective  删除换行1 tissue diseases e.g. systemic lupus erythomatosus,  删除换行1 scleroderma, polyarteritis nodosa or Raynaud's phenomenon  删除换行1 may be present.\n\n【27】Pathology.—\n\n【28】The gross feature is the preservation of the lobular  删除换行1 architecture of the gland. The most important microscopic  删除换行1 change is extensive replacement of the acinar parenchyma  删除换行1 with lymphoid tissue. There is also intraductal proliferation  删除换行1 of both epithelial and myoepithelial elements. As a  删除换行1 consequence the ducts are converted into solid islands  删除换行1 some of which may eventually undergo hyalinization. In  删除换行1 general hypergammaglobulinaemia, eosinophilia, leukopenia  删除换行1 and cryoglobulinaemia are often noticed as laboratory  删除换行1 findings.\n\n【29】The condition is regarded as an autoimmune disease,  删除换行1 very much resembles Hashimut is' disease of the thyroid.\nPresence of circulating antisalivary gland antibodies can  删除换行1 be demonstrated. Autoantibodies such as rheumatoid factor  删除换行1 and antinuclear factor may be demonstrated in the serum.\n\n【30】It must be remembered that diffuse enlargement of  删除换行1 the salivary and lacrimal glands may be seen in such  删除换行1 cases as malignant lymphoma, tuberculosis, sarcoidosis and  删除换行1 even syphilis.\n\n【31】Clinical features.—\n\n【32】(i) This condition predominantly occurs in 删除换行1 women.\n\n【33】(ii) Majority of the patients are over 40 years of 删除换行1 age.\n\n【34】(iii) The condition develops slowly and painlessly.\n\n【35】(iv) Systemic manifestations are the main features  删除换行1 of Sjogren's syndrome. Rheumatoid arthritis mainly affects  删除换行1 the small joints and is generalised.\n\n【36】HISTORY.—\n\n【37】(i) Rare complications of Mikulicz's disease is the  删除换行1 development of malignant lymphoma within the involved  删除换行1 salivary glands.\n\n【38】(ii) There may be occurrence of malignant variant  删除换行1 of Mikulicz's disease, which is an extremely rare  删除换行1 occurrence and is characterised by repeated local  删除换行1 recurrences and eventually lymph node metastasis.\n\n【39】Treatment.—\n\n【40】(i) The condition may resolve by itself after  删除换行1 months or years.\n\n【41】(ii) Steroids and immunosuppressive agents may be  删除换行1 used, but one should be aware of the side effects. Such  删除换行1 treatment also increases the risk of ascending infection.\n\n【42】(iii) Radiotherapy may reduce the enlargement of  删除换行1 the salivary gland of Mikulicz's disease, but increases  删除换行1 dryness of the mouth and tendency towards infection.\n\n【43】(iv) Oral hygiene should be particularly maintained.\n\n【44】(v) Surgery.— It may be tried when steroid therapy  删除换行1 and X-ray therapy cannot improve the condition.\nSuperficial parotidectomy and excision of the  删除换行1 submandibular salivary glands will definitely reduce the  删除换行1 deformity. Lacrimal glands should be left alone.\n\n【45】SYMPTOMS.—\nA parotid fistula may arise from the parotid gland  删除换行1 or the parwtid duct. Such fistula may be internal when  删除换行1 it opens inside the mouth or external when it opens to  删除换行1 the exterior.\n\n【46】CAUSES.— Parotid fistula may occur from :\n\n【47】(i) Penetrating injury particularly by glass splinters.\n\n【48】(ii) Rupture of parotid abscess.\n\n【49】(iii) Inadvertent incision for drainage of parotid  删除换行1 abscess.\n\n【50】(iv) Complication of superficial parotidectomy.\n\n【51】Clinical features.—\n\n【52】The main complaint is an opening on the cheek  删除换行1 with discharge. On careful questioning it will be evident  删除换行1 that discharge comes out only during meals. There may  删除换行1 be excoriation of the neighbourhood skin.\n\n【53】Special Investigations.—•\n\n【54】A sialogram should be performed with watery solution  删除换行1 of lipiodol. This will give an indication whether the fistula  删除换行1 is in relation to the main duct, ductule or to the gland.\n\n【55】Treatment.—\n(i) When the fistula is connected with the main  删除换行1 duct — reconstruction of the duct by Newman or  删除换行5 Seabrock's operation should be performed. In this  删除换行1 operation one probe is passed through the parotid duct  删除换行1 opening in the mouth in a rertograde fashion into the  删除换行1 parotid duct upto the fistula. Another probe is introduced  删除换行1 through the external fistula. A horizontal incision is made  删除换行1 on the cheek. The ducts are dissected out and the divided  删除换行1 ends are identified and made free. A tantalum wire is  删除换行1 passed into the distal and proximal ends of the duct.\nThe severed ends are now sutured with free chromic  删除换行1 catgut over the tantalum wire. The adjacent connective  删除换行1 tissues are approximated with great care so that there is  删除换行1 no chance of recurrence. The skin incision is closed. The 删除换行1 end of the tantalum wire which comes out through the  删除换行1 parotid duct opening into the mouth is anchored by  删除换行1 adhesive plaster.\n\n【56】The wire is kept in situ for 3 weeks.\n\n【57】(ii) If reconstruction fails, the auriculotemporal  删除换行1 nerve which carries secretomotor fibres to the parotid  删除换行1 gland is resected.\n\n【58】(iii) If the above method fails, complete  删除换行1 parotidectomy is advised preserving the facial nerve.\n\n【59】AURICHLOTEMPC删除38：<u>)</u>RAL SYNDROME\n(SYN. FREY’S SYNDROME)\n\n【60】Partial injury to the auriculotemporal nerve gives rise  删除换行1 to such syndrome. This type of injury —\n\n【61】(i) May be congenital, possibly due to birth 删除换行1 trauma.\n\n【62】(ii) May be accidental injury.\n\n【63】(iii) May be caused by inadvertent incision for  删除换行1 drainage of parotid abscess.\n\n【64】(iv) May occasionally follow superficial  删除换行1 parotidectomy.\n\n【65】In this condition (a) there is flushing and sweating  删除换行1 of the skin innervated by the auriculotemporal nerve  删除换行1 particularly during meal and (b) presence of cutaneous  删除换行1 hyperaesthesia in front and above the ear the area supplied  删除换行1 by the auriculotemporal nerve.\n\n【66】The EXPLANATION of this syndrome is —\n\n【67】(i) The postganglionic parasympathetic fibres  删除换行1 become united to the sympathetic nerves from the  删除换行1 superior cervical ganglion which are concerned to supply  删除换行1 vessels and sweat glands of that region. This causes  删除换行1 flushing and sweating of the skin.\n\n【68】(ii) Following injury to the auriculotemporal nerve,  删除换行1 postganglionic parasympathetic fibres from the otic  删除换行1 ganglion grow down the sheaths of the cutaneous  删除换行1 filaments, so hyperaesthesia follows stimulation of the  删除换行1 secretomotor nerves.\n\n【69】EXAMINATIONS.—\n\n【70】If the symptoms persist, the treatment is avulsion of  删除换行1 the auriculotemporal nerve in front of the auricle where  删除换行1 it lies just posterior to the superficial temporal vessels.\n\n【71】SYNDROME\n\n【72】Salivary stones are more common in the  删除换行1 submandibular salivary gland than in the parotid gland  删除换行1 because the saliva of the submandibular salivary gland is 删除换行1 more viscid and saturated in calcium salts. Such stones  删除换行1 develop more frequently within the duct of the  删除换行1 submandibular gland (Wharton's duct). Less commonly  删除换行1 the calculi may occur within the gland substance.\n\n【73】AETIOLOGY.— Pathogenesis of calculus formation  删除换行1 is unknown. It has been suggested —\n\n【74】(i) That chronic inflammation may cause  删除换行1 inspissation of the saliva and deposition of calcium salts.\n\n【75】(ii) That retention of secretion may cause calculi  删除换行1 formation. Such retention is more common in the  删除换行1 submandibular salivary gland as the duct has a very  删除换行1 curved route and the secretion from the superficial lobe  删除换行1 goes up and reach the submandibular duct through the  删除换行1 deep part which is not a dependent drainage.\n\n【76】Composition of the stone.—\n\n【77】A salivary gland calculus is composed of cellular  删除换行1 debris and mucus in the centre, but the main content is  删除换行1 calcium and magnesium phosphate. Such combination is  删除换行1 found in tartar of the tooth.\n\n【78】Clinical features.—\n\n【79】Painful swelling during meals is the most important  删除换行1 symptom. Such pain may be preceded by salivary colic.\nWhen this history is forthcoming, the patient should be  删除换行1 given some lemon juice and the swelling can be produced.\nAt this time if one examines the orifice of the affected  删除换行1 duct, it shows little or no ejection of saliva.\n\n【80】COMPLICATIONS.—\n\n【81】(i) Age.— Majority of the patients are young to  删除换行1 middle age. This condition is rarely seen in children.\n\n【82】(ii) Sex.— Males and females are almost equally  删除换行1 involved.\n\n【83】PAROTID FISTULA\n\n【84】(i) The main complaint is pain and swelling  删除换行1 beneath the jaw just before and during meals. Both the  删除换行1 symptoms last throughout the meal. After certain period  删除换行1 the pain and the swelling gradually subside.\n\n【85】(ii) Some residual pain and swelling beneath the  删除换行1 jaw may be the constant complaint.\n\n【86】(iii) Some discomfort or swelling may be  删除换行1 complained of in the floor of the mouth. Some patients  删除换行1 may give a typical history of colic just before the meals.\n\n【87】(iv) Patient may be able to relieve his symptoms  删除换行1 by pressing on the gland. On the other hand such action  删除换行1 may lead to ejection of foul tasting fluid in the mouth  删除换行1 (purulent saliva).\n\n【88】(v) Patient may give previous history of similar  删除换行1 symptom on the other side of the face.SALIVARY GLANDS 83\n\n【89】TREATMENT.—\n\n【90】Sometimes the submandibular gland may be swollen  删除换行1 when the patient presents to the doctor. If such swelling  删除换行1 is not present, the clinician can produce the condition  删除换行1 artificially by instilling a few drops of lemon juice into  删除换行1 the patient's mouth. This will cause pain and swelling of  删除换行1 the gland. The clinician must look at the opening of the  删除换行1 involved duct and no saliva is seen to be coming out  删除换行1 through that orifice.\n\n【91】Once the swelling is detected, the lump is examined  删除换行1 in the following manner —\n\n【92】(i) Temperature and tenderness.— Usually the gland  删除换行1 is not hot, but if it is infected, it may be hot and the  删除换行1 overlying skin will be red and oedematous. Slight  删除换行1 tenderness may be expected.\n\n【93】(ii) Consistency.— The distended gland feels elastic,  删除换行1 rubbery and firm.\n\n【94】(iii) Bimanual palpation is important. The gland is  删除换行1 felt between the index finger of one hand inside the  删除换行1 mouth and fingers of the other hand on the outer surface  删除换行1 of the lump just below the mandible 删除33：<u></u>. The finger inside the  删除换行1 mouth can feel the deep part of the salivary gland. To  删除换行1 exclude impaction of the stone in the duct, the whole 删除换行1 duct must be palpated bimanually.\n\n【95】The floor Of The Mouth.—\n\n【96】Inspection.— The patient is asked to open his mouth  删除换行1 and lift his tongue to the roof of the mouth. This  删除换行1 displays the floor of the mouth for inspection. By means  删除换行1 of a torch it is inspected carefully. The orifices of the  删除换行1 submandibular (Wharton's) ducts are situated on the  删除换行1 either side of frenulum linguae. It is noted whether the  删除换行1 orifice looks inflamed or swollen due to impaction of a  删除换行1 stone in the duct. A stone may be impacted in the  删除换行1 ampulla just beneath the orifice and can be seen if  删除换行1 inspected carefully. If the salivary gland is infected, slight  删除换行1 pressure on the gland will extrude pus through the  删除换行1 respective orifice. If a stone is impacted in one duct,  删除换行1 saliva will be seen coming out with normal flow from  删除换行1 the other orifice while the orifice concerned remains dry.\nThis may be tested by two dry swabs one on each orifice  删除换行1 and some lemon juice may be dropped on the dorsum  删除换行1 of the tongue. A minute later the patient is asked to  删除换行1 move the tongue up and two swabs are examined. The  删除换行1 swab on the orifice of the duct where the stone is  删除换行1 impacted will remain dry.",

        "text": "【0】Question: 54.1 A 32-year-old female G1P1001 presents to address problems with her combination OCP. She has noticed increased breakthrough bleeding and spotting over the past few months. She is still having regular menses and denies any other complaints and is happy with the type of contraception. Which of the following would be your next step?\n\n【1】A. Provide drug-free period for 1–2 months\n\n【2】B. Switch to progestin-only pill\n\n【3】C. Increase the progesterone component of the combination OCP\n\n【4】D. Increase the estrogen component\n\n【5】Answer: 54.1 D. As the patient is happy with the type of contraceptive, the preference should not be to change to a difference modality. Simply increasing the estrogen component will typically help reduce the irregularity and intermenstrual bleeding.\n\n【6】Question: 54.2 A 37-year-old morbidly obese female G6P6006 who is married, monogamous, presents to address contraceptive options. At present she does not desire fertility for several years. She has no past medical or surgical history, but does smoke two packs per day. Which of the following options would be least preferred in this patient?\n\n【7】A. Ortho Evra transdermal patch\n\n【8】B. Mirena IUD\n\n【9】C. Depo-Provera injection\n\n【10】D. Progestin-only pill\n\n【11】Answer: 54.2 A. Obese patients over 198 pounds typically have much less success with the Ortho Evra patch. In addition as the patient is over the age of 35 and a heavy smoker (over 15 cigarettes daily), it would be prudent to avoid any contraceptive containing estrogen to diminish the cardiovascular and VTE risks. All of the other choices would provide adequate contraception without the above risks as they are all progesterone-only options. As the patient desires contraception for several years, the Mirena IUD would be ideal in this patient.\n\n【12】Question: 54.3 A 24-year-old nulliparous female with no past medical history presents to discuss contraception. She has a history of acne and painful menses since menarche. She has regular menses now and uses condoms for STI prevention. The patient’s biggest concern is not to have unexpected spotting, intermenstrual bleeding, or irregularity of her cycles as this would negatively affect her sex life. Which of the following options would be best for this patient?\n\n【13】A. Progestin-only pill\n\n【14】B. Implanon intradermal implant\n\n【15】C. Mirena IUD\n\n【16】D. Combination monophasic OCP\nAnswer: 54.3 D. Acne and dysmenorrhea (painful menses) can be improved with combination OCPs. The progesterone-only options (which include choices a–c) could worsen acne and have a much higher risk of irregular menses, intermenstrual bleeding, and spotting. In addition, they are less effective for dysmenorrhea than the combination OCPs. Monophasic combination OCPs are generally better than biphasic or triphasic combination OCPs in regulating menses.\n\n【17】PHARMACOLOGY PEARLS\n\n【18】 Progesterone-only contraceptives offer the advantage of not increasing VTE or cardiovascular risks compared to combination estrogen/progesterone agents.\n\n【19】 Combination estrogen/progesterone products help with acne, dysmenorrhea, as well as menstrual irregularities, and have been associated with a decrease in ovarian and endometrial cancers.\n\n【20】 Contraceptive choice should be based on patient preference, risk of comorbidities, desired duration of contraception, cost, and avoidance of contraindications.\n\n【21】 LARC agents have higher typical use efficacy than the other agents due to decreased need for daily patient compliance.\n\n【22】#",

Two-Step Phototherapy for Patients with Resistant Disease\n=============================================================\n\n【3】John Koo <sup>1 <span class=\"ContactIcon\"></span></sup> and Mio Nakamura <sup>1</sup>\n\n【4】通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>\n\n【5】Psoriasis and Skin Treatment Center, Department of Dermatology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA\n\n【6】Case\n----\n\n【7】A 27-year-old male with generalized plaque psoriasis worst on the lower legs presents for follow up. He has been doing NB-UVB phototherapy 3 times per week in the office for the past year with great improvement of psoriasis on his trunk. However, he continues to have stubborn plaques on both of his shins. In addition to regular phototherapy, he uses topical corticosteroids to these stubborn areas with minimal additional improvement. He is very bothered by the appearance of his lower legs and the fact that he cannot wear shorts or go to the beach without being embarrassed. The patient states that the 3 times per week phototherapy regimen has been manageable with his schedule and he can continue treatments; however, he would like these resistant plaques to go away. One examination, he has well-demarcated, thick erythematous plaques with minimal scale on the bilateral shins and ankles. His chest, abdomen, and back are clear of psoriasis.\n\n【8】In order to further improve the psoriasis on his lower legs, the patient is started on a two-step phototherapy regimen. During each treatment session, the trunk and extremities are first treated as per protocol. Then all of his skin except for the lower legs is covered with a gown and towels, and he is again exposed to light, starting at a low dose and increasing per protocol. He is also instructed to step on a stool in the phototherapy booth to improve irradiation to the lower legs. With this two-step regimen, the patient returns 3 months later with near clearance of the stubborn plaques on his lower legs.\n\n【9】Discussion\n----------\n\n【10】It is not uncommon for patients to have only a partial response to UVB phototherapy. Typically, adequate improvement of disease is seen on the trunk, but treatment response may be poor on the distal extremities 删除33：<u></u>. In such cases, instead of declaring that these patients have “failed” UVB, the two-step approach can be utilized 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】删除3：<u>Figure 12.1\n\n【12】A patient with recalcitrant psoriasis on the lower legs who would benefit from two-step phototherapy, which allows for higher doses of additional light to be given to the legs</u>\n\n【13】In the two-step approach, patients will first receive phototherapy as usual to the whole body for overall exposure (the face and genitals should be covered if there is no disease in these areas). After completing this portion of the treatment session, the patient will come out of the booth and cover areas of the body with lower MED such as the trunk. Since the extremities can generally tolerate more light than the trunk, the patient will then re-enter the phototherapy booth to receive an additional dose of the light to the extremities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u> 删除33：<u></u>. The second step of this two-step regimen should be started at low dose and increased as tolerated per protocol. Examples of how this two-step phototherapy can be effectively documented in the patients’ medical records are illustrated in Table 12.1 .\n\n【14】删除3：<u>Figure 12.2\n\n【15】The two-step phototherapy allows for higher doses of light to be delivered to resistant areas such as the extremities</u>\nTable 12.1 删除换行 Examples of how to document the two-step phototherapy regimen effectively into the patients’ medical records: ( a ) a patient with psoriasis on NB-UVB, ( b ) a patient with atopic dermatitis on BB-UVB\n\n【16】In the present patient who has recalcitrant psoriasis plaques on the lower legs, in addition to the above two-step approach whereby he receives additional dosage of light to the legs, it may also be helpful for the patient to step on a stool to elevate himself while in the booth 删除33：<u></u>.

        "text": "【0】CASE 99: A BREATHLESS PATIENT WITH DERMATOMYOSITIS\n\n【1】History\n\n【2】A 45-year-old woman has been admitted to the rheumatology ward with a diagnosis of  删除换行1 dermatomyositis. She is profoundly weak (muscle power 2/5 in all proximal groups) and  删除换行1 on admission received a pulse of intravenous methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide.\nShe remains on 60 mg prednisolone orally, bone protection and thromboprophylaxis. Ten  删除换行1 days after admission her muscle strength has not improved and the senior house officer  删除换行1 is asked to review her as she has become acutely more breathless.\n\n【3】Examination\n\n【4】This woman appears exhausted and unwell with marked peripheral myopathy. She has a  删除换行1 temperature of 37.8°C and her oxygen saturation is 88 per cent on room air. Her pulse  删除换行1 rate is 92/min and blood pressure 125/86 mmHg. Her jugular venous pulse (JVP) is not  删除换行1 elevated and her heart sounds are normal with no peripheral oedema or evidence of deep  删除换行1 venous thrombosis. She is short of breath at rest (20 breaths per minute) with reduced  删除换行1 chest wall movements bilaterally. Her right mid-zone is dull to percussion with increased  删除换行1 vocal resonance. There are mild crackles throughout which clear with coughing.\n\n【5】Questions\n\n【6】• What is the differential diagnosis of breathlessness in this patient?\n\n【7】• What are the appropriate investigations?\n\n【8】• How would you manage her?\n\n【9】ANSWER 99\n\n【10】Patients with severe muscle weakness have several reasons for breathlessness. The main  删除换行1 differential diagnoses to consider are:\n\n【11】• ventilatory failure due to respiratory muscle weakness\n\n【12】• pneumonia, including due to aspiration and particularly in those who have received  删除换行1 immunosuppression\n\n【13】• interstitial lung disease\n\n【14】• pulmonary embolus due to immobility.\n\n【15】The clinical features in this case (fever and findings consistent with pneumonia), on a  删除换行1 background of profound immunosuppression, would make pneumonia the most likely  删除换行1 explanation for her deterioration. Infection is a significant problem in this patient population: respiratory muscle weakness may lead to atelectasis and collapse which increase  删除换行1 the risk of infection. In addition, her orophayngeal muscles may be involved, leading to  删除换行1 aspiration. Although interstitial lung disease occurs in 5–10 per cent of dermatomyositis  删除换行1 patients, it typically develops more insidiously and presents with late or pan-inspiratory  删除换行1 crackles that do not clear with coughing (such clearing would be more suggestive of  删除换行1 transmitted sounds from upper airway secretions). Although she is on thromboprophylaxis which reduces the chance of pulmonary embolus and there is no history of pleuritic  删除换行1 chest pain or haemoptysis and her JVP is normal, thromboembolism should always be  删除换行1 considered.\n\n【16】Appropriate immediate investigations include:\n\n【17】• arterial blood gas to assess respiratory failure\n\n【18】• blood cultures to assess for infection\n\n【19】• chest X-ray looking for features of bronchopneumonia, collapse or interstitial lung  删除换行1 disease\n\n【20】• spirometry to assess reduction in vital capacity.\n\n【21】It would be appropriate to commence broad-spectrum antibiotics intravenously to cover  删除换行1 for aspiration and nosocomial infection (advice should be sought from local microbiology  删除换行1 services). She should receive chest physiotherapy to help clear secretions and reduce the  删除换行1 risk of lobar collapse. These patients may deteriorate rapidly and early review by respiratory and intensive care teams is appropriate.\n\n【22】KEY POINTS\n\n【23】• The differential diagnosis of breathlessness in patients with dermatomyositis includes  删除换行1 infection, ventilatory failure, interstitial lung disease and thromboembolism.\n\n【24】• Chest physiotherapy is central to management and should be instituted early.\n\n【25】• Seek advice from respiratory and intensive care teams promptly.\n\n【26】删除测试2：<u>Rheumatology\n\n【27】</u>",

The lesion had started as a small erythematous papule and then  删除换行1 spread out very gradually to form a scaly, ring-shaped lesion. The itching is not intense  删除换行1 but she does find herself scratching. She has no history of previous skin problems. Her  删除换行1 7-year-old son has eczema and a dry scaly scalp. She has used some of her son’s cortisone  删除换行1 ointment on the lesion, which seemed to reduce the itching and scaling but the lesion  删除换行1 has continued to expand.\nExamination\n\n【4】There is an annular lesion 9 cm in diameter with a raised edge over the right knee  删除换行1 删除33：<u></u>. Marked hyperpigmentation, erythema and multiple papules and pustules are  删除换行1 seen at the raised edge. Her scalp and nails are normal, as is the rest of her skin. She has  删除换行1 brought her son with her to the clinic; he has a very scaly scalp with patches of alopecia  删除换行1 and occipital lymphadenopathy.\n\n【5】Mycology scrapings from the edge of the right knee lesion were examined by microscopy  删除换行1 (fungal hyphae were seen), and tissue culture (result: Trichophyton tonsurans)\n\n【6】Mycology brushings from the son’s scalp were examined by tissue culture (result: T. tonsurans)\n\n【7】INVESTIGATIONS\n\n【8】删除3：<u>Figure 86.1</u>\n\n【9】Questions\n\n【10】• What is the diagnosis?\n\n【11】• From whom did the patient acquire the  删除换行1 infection?\n\n【12】• How would you treat the mother and  删除换行1 child?\nANSWER 86\nThe healthcare assistant has a cutaneous fungal infection caused by the dermatophyte  删除换行5 Trichophyton tonsurans. The patient had used a cortisone ointment on the fungal infection  删除换行1 which altered the cutaneous appearance. This phenomenon is so-called ‘tinea incognito’  删除换行1 (steroid-modified tinea), whereby the fungal infection continues to spread outwards but  删除换行1 the scale is reduced and small papules and pustules may appear at the growing margin.\n\n【13】T. tonsurans is the main cause of tinea capitis  删除换行1 (scalp ‘ringworm’) in children living in urban areas.\nThe fungus is anthropophilic – that is, passed  删除换行1 between humans. The usual cutaneous manifestation of tinea corporis (i.e. not treated with topical  删除换行1 corticosteroid) is shown in Figure 86.2. The classic  删除换行1 presentation includes annular lesions that are scaly  删除换行1 at the edge with central clearing; the eruption is  删除换行1 mildly pruritic.\n\n【14】The patient’s son had tinea capitis, which is the  删除换行1 most likely source of the infection. T. tonsurans is  删除换行1 likely to spread to adults when the infected child’s  删除换行1 head comes into direct contact with the adults’ skin,  删除换行1 usually on the neck / anterior chest where a child’s  删除换行1 head rests whilst sitting on their lap. If an adult  删除换行1 presents with a T. tonsurans, ask about contact  删除换行1 with children.\nSamples for mycology are very easy to take and results are useful in guiding treatment.\nSkin scrapings can be taken using a blunt scalpel blade from the active edge of the  删除换行1 lesions. Samples should be sent to the laboratory in folded coloured paper. Scalp brushings can be taken using plastic sterile disposable travel toothbrushes, using brisk brushing  删除换行1 movements back and forth across the scalp. Brush siblings and parents.\n删除3：<u>Figure 86.2\n\n【15】Clues to the diagnosis of tinea corporis !</u>\n\n【16】• The skin site affected – fungi often prefer the flexures (groin/axillae)\n• The eruption will often be asymmetrical – unlike many inflammatory dermatoses  删除换行1 such as psoriasis and eczema\n\n【17】• Concomitant fungal nail infection – onychomycosis\n\n【18】• Underlying diseases – such as diabetes, immunosupression\n\n【19】• Others at home are affected – especially children with tinea capitis\n\n【20】• Worsening with use of topical steroid\n\n【21】T. tonsurans is an endothrix fungus, which means that the fungal spores reside inside the  删除换行1 hair shaft; consequently, scalp infections need to be managed with systemic antifungal  删除换行1 medications. In the past, griseofulvin was used to treat tinea capitis in children at a dose  删除换行1 of 10 mg/kg daily for 6–8 weeks, however one month of terbinafine is equally effective  删除换行1 and better tolerated at a daily dose depending on the child’s weight: \u0005 20 kg, 62.5 mg;  删除换行1 20–40 kg, 125 mg; \u0007 40 kg, 250 mg. Tinea corporis can be managed with topical terbinafine 1% cream used twice daily for 4-6 weeks. Alternatives are oral terbinafine 250 mg  删除换行1 daily for 2 weeks or oral itraconazole 400 mg daily for 1 week.\n KEY POINTS\n\n【22】• A cutaneous fungal infection should be suspected in a patient with isolated scaly  删除换行1 annular lesions.\n\n【23】• Classical signs of tinea can be altered by topical steroid use or secondary bacterial  删除换行1 infection.\n\n【24】• Tinea capitis in urban areas is most frequently caused by endothrix fungal species that  删除换行1 require systemic therapy.删除6：<u>This page intentionally left blank 193</u>",

        "text": "【0】CASE 14: A PATIENT PRESENTS ACUTELY UNWELL WITH ALL HIS\n\n【1】SKIN RED AND HOT\n\n【2】History\n\n【3】A 50-year-old man presents to the on-call dermatologist with a 3-day history of rigors,  删除换行1 feeling generally unwell and redness of all his skin associated with scaling. He also  删除换行1 complains of swelling of his arms and legs. Since his teenage years he has suffered with  删除换行1 a scaly scalp and occasional dry patches on the elbows. There is a family history of psoriasis. Recently he has been experiencing increasing episodes of angina and has sought  删除换行1 medical attention.\n\n【4】Examination\n\n【5】There is widespread erythema affecting the face, trunk and limbs with thickening of the  删除换行1 skin and associated widespread scale 删除33：<u></u>. Thick scale is present throughout the  删除换行1 scalp with dystrophy of all 20 nails. Over the elbows erythematous plaques with overlying  删除换行1 thick scale are seen. In addition there are mild bilateral ectropions.\n\n【6】Questions\n\n【7】• What is the likely diagnosis?\n\n【8】• What is the differential diagnosis?\n\n【9】• How would you manage this patient?\n\n【10】• What are the potential complications?\n\n【11】删除3：<u>Figure 14.132</u>\n\n【12】ANSWER 14\n\n【13】The most likely diagnosis is erythrodermic psoriasis. Erythroderma is when almost the  删除换行1 entire skin (\u0007 90%) becomes red; in the case of psoriasis the skin is also thickened and  删除换行1 scaly. There is usually hyperkeratosis of the palmar/plantar sites. There may be onycholysis (lifting of the nail plates) and even shedding of the nails. Thinning of the hair and  删除换行1 alopecia may also occur. Clues in this patient to the underlying cause of his erythroderma  删除换行1 are his dystrophic nails and classic plaques of psoriasis over his elbows. In addition he  删除换行1 has a history of scalp scaling and a family history of psoriasis.\n\n【14】Erythrodema is a serious and at times life-threatening dermatological emergency.\nErythrodermic skin is associated with fever, rigors and lymphadenopathy.\nOther causes of erythroderma include atopic eczema, drug eruptions, cutaneous T-cell  删除换行1 lymphoma, allergic contact dermatitis, pityriasis rubra pilaris and seborrheoic dermatitis.\nTo diagnose the underlying cause can be very challenging and signs and symptoms of  删除换行1 pre-existing dermatoses may help, as in this case.\n\n【15】Complications result from significant physiological and metabolic changes that occur  删除换行1 when the skin barrier function starts to fail. Thermoregulatory control is lost, leaving  删除换行1 patients vulnerable to hypothermia due to excess heat loss. Dehydration commonly  删除换行1 occurs owing to increased transepidermal water. Cutaneous inflammation may mask  删除换行1 concurrent secondary skin infection and blood cultures may be positive owing to their  删除换行1 easy contamination with normal skin flora. Hypoalbuminaemia and cardiac failure are  删除换行1 serious complications that particularly affect the elderly.\n\n【16】Treatment is supportive. In-patient management and skilled nursing care are essential.\nClose monitoring of pulse, blood pressure, temperature and fluid balance is mandatory.\nHourly emollient therapy with liquid paraffin and mild topical steroids are the mainstay  删除换行1 of the acute phase. The use of systemic corticosteroids in the acute setting is controversial, as there is some evidence they can exacerbate the condition and may even have been  删除换行1 the initial trigger. Adequate nutritional support to minimize protein losses is important.\nHaemodynamic instability and intercurrent infections are treated as necessary.\n\n【17】Patients usually require systemic therapy; historically ciclosporin has been given for  删除换行1 its fast mode of action. However, some dermatologists are now treating these very sick  删除换行1 patients with first-line systemic anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha preparations such as  删除换行1 infliximab.\n\n【18】 KEY POINTS\n\n【19】• Erythroderma is when almost the entire skin (\u0007 90%) becomes red.\n\n【20】• It is a serious and at times life-threatening dermatological emergency.\n\n【21】• Management is supportive in addition to treatment of the underlying cause.",

The bleeding had stopped; however, several broken flight feathers on both wings resulted in dried blood, covering the feathers on the wings and body coverts.\n\n【6】The client reported that the bird had been picking her feathers for the past 2 years, and this behavior had gotten worse during the past year. She also reported that the bird was presented to a veterinarian who specializes in birds a year earlier for a mass just cranial to the cloaca on the ventral side of the bird. At that time, the mass was considered to be benign and of no concern, according to the veterinarian. The \"mass\" had increased dramatically in size since that time. The bird laid a normal clutch of two eggs 4 months prior to presentation.\n\n【7】The bird was housed in a commercial birdcage and fed a diet of commercial pellets and nuts. Other pets in the household included three dogs, a cat, and a Rosella parrot (Platycercus sp.).﻿\n\n【8】Physical Examination Findings\n\n【9】The 1.1-kg cockatoo was extremely nervous and exhibited frightened behavior and signs of stress in the examination room. Although it did not vocalize, it tried to escape capture. The bird exhibited severe alopecia owing to feather picking, resulting in a large area of missing feathers on the enlarged abdominal area. A large herniated area just cranial to cloaca was observed. Palpation of this area indicated soft-tissue structures and no hard mass. The droppings appeared normal, suggesting normal gastrointestinal and urinary function.\n\n【10】Blood was collected via jugular venipuncture for a blood profile while the bird was placed under isoflurane anesthesia via face mask for whole body radiograph evaluations. A fine-needle aspiration biopsy of an in-tracoelomic mass was obtained for cytodiagnosis. The sample appeared clear and greasy when placed on the microscope slides 删除33：<u></u>.﻿\n\n【11】Interpretive Discussion\n\n【12】The initial whole body radiographs 删除33：<u></u> reveal a large soft-tissue opaque mass in the caudal dorsal aspect of the coelomic cavity, causing cranial and ventral displacement of the coelomic structures. This likely represents a neoplastic mass arising from the reproductive tract. There appears to be a marked enlargement of the hepatic silhouette, extending beyond the margins of the coxofemoral joint on the ven-trodorsal view. The enlarged hepatic silhouette can be associated with hepatomegaly, proventricular dilation, or an intracoelomic mass. There is a rounded soft-tissue opacity, extending beyond the caudal ventral aspect of the vent correlating with this patient's described history of having a hernia. The hernia is likely due to the space occupying mass in the caudal dorsal coelomic cavity. A rounded, oblong soft-tissue opacity ventral to the synsacrum can be seen on the lateral view. This likely represents either renomegaly or gonadomegaly. There is increased opacity within the long bones, representing medullary hyperostosis associated with follicular genesis.\n\n【13】删除3：<u>Fig. 63.1 .

The proventriculus is normal in size. Owing to the limited progress of the barium's travel through the gastrointestinal tract after 85 minutes, the bird likely has decreased gastrointestinal motility. There is contrast within the small intestines, which is being ventrally displaced by the previously described soft-tissue mass in the caudodorsal coelomic cavity. There is a loop of small intestine (likely duodenum based on its shape) incorporated into the previously described hernia. The radiographic studies in this bird indicate herniation of small intestines owing to displacement by a soft-tissue mass in the coelomic cavity. Differentials include neoplasia arising from the urinary system or reproductive tract.\n\n【18】删除3：<u>Fig. 63.5 . (a and b) The fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the intracoelomic mass (Wright–Giemsa stain, 100x).</u>\n\n【19】The blood profile reveals a nonregenerative anemia. This is likely associated with an anemia of chronic disorders. There is no evidence of inflammation. The glucose is elevated, which is likely associated with a stress response. The plasma creatine kinase activity is increased owing to muscle exertion during handling or possible recent trauma to the skeletal muscles (the bird fell from the examination table onto the floor landing on her keel when being examined). The marked increase in the plasma calcium concentration is likely associated with current folliculogenesis activity as indicated by the hyperostosis of the long bones in the radiographic examinations.\n删除4：<u>Table 63.1 . Hematology findings.\n</u>删除4：<u>Table 63.2 . Plasma biochemical results.\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figures 63.4 and 63.5 show a moderately cellular sample that contains a slight number of erythrocytes. There are large cells that occur in aggregates or singly. These cells have an abundant vacuolated cytoplasm and an eccentrically located oval nucleus. The background contains numerous round, clear spaces. These spaces and the clear vacuoles in the cells likely represent fat that does not stain with the Wright–Giemsa stain. The large cells are adipocytes and the cytology is representative of a lipoma or liposarcoma. The clear, oily appearance of the specimen on the slide indicates that the sample is from fatty tissue.</u>\n\n【20】The blood profile and radiographic evidence of hy-perostosis indicating active folliculogenesis and the history of the bird laying a clutch of normal eggs 5 months prior to presentation suggest a normal female reproductive tract. The intracoelomic mass seen on radiographs likely does not involve the gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract, or reproductive tract. The cytologic examination of the sample aspirated from the coelomic mass indicates fatty tissue and supports a diagnosis of an intracoelomic lipoma, infiltrative lipoma, or lipo-sarcoma.﻿\n\n【21】Summary\n\n【22】The cockatoo was admitted for an intracoelomic exploratory surgery to investigate the nature of the in-tracoelomic mass and repair the hernia.\n\n【23】The cockatoo was given 1.1 mg butorphanol, 0.33 mg midazolam, and 0.033 mg atropine intramuscularly as a preanesthetic treatment. Twenty minutes later, the bird was induced and maintained with isoflurane anesthesia following endotracheal intubation using a 4.0 mm tube. During the 1 hour and 24 minutes surgery, the bird was given 48.8 mL lactated Ringer's solution intravenously via a catheter placed in the basilic vein. The bird also received 5 mL of an esterified amylopectin-containing starch (hetastarch) intravenously during the procedure. Prior to recovery, the bird received 0.5 mg meloxicam intramuscularly and 1.0 mg butorphanol intramuscularly.\n\n【24】The bird was placed in dorsal recumbency, and ra–diocautery was used to create a skin incision extending 2 cm from the caudal point of the keel to just cranial to the herniated area cranial to the cloaca. A body wall incision was made using radiocautery to expose the contents of the coelomic cavity. A large amount of yellow fat was found, occupying the majority of the coelomic cavity and encircling the ventriculus 删除33：<u></u>. A large amount of fat along with the duodenum was found herni-ated through the body wall. As much as possible, the fat was carefully removed using blunt dissection. A cloa–copexy using 5-0 polytrimethylene carbonate suture was used to close the body wall in a simple continuous pattern in the area of the hernia. The rest of the body wall was closed using the same material and pattern. The skin was closed using a 4-0 glycomer 631 suture in a simple interrupted pattern. A portion of the fatty tissue removed from the bird's coelomic cavity was submitted for histopathologic evaluation.\n\n【25】删除3：<u>Fig. 63.6 . A large amount of intracoelomic fat found during surgery.</u>\n\n【26】The bird made an uneventful recovery from anesthesia and surgery and was placed in the critical care facility for close observation for 12 hours. She was treated with meloxicam (0.5 mg PO daily) postoperatively. Although she made no attempt to remove her sutures, she was sent home with an Elizabethan collar designed for birds in the event she pull at the sutures. At home the bird was less active than normal; however, she was eating and playing with her toys according to the client. The bird died 29 hours following her surgery possibly as a result of reperfusion problems or lipid embolism. No necropsy was performed.\n\n【27】Histopathologic evaluation revealed sheets of normal adipocytes with moderate infiltration by lymphocytes, macrophages, multinucleated giant cells, and fewer heterophils. Frequently at the junction of the adipose lobules, there were areas of moderate degeneration and necrosis. A histologic diagnosis of necrotic lipoma was made.",

However, when he is discharged a week later she gives him her number  删除换行1 and says they should go out for a drink now that he is no longer an inpatient.\n\n【2】Questions\n\n【3】• Is it appropriate for a doctor to have a relationship with a patient?\n\n【4】• What should a doctor do if she is serious about having a relationship with a patient?\n\n【5】• Are their situations where relationships would be inappropriate even if the therapeutic relationship had ended?\n\n【6】ANSWER 98\n\n【7】The GMC guidance on relationships between doctors and patients is quite straightforward –  删除换行1 it does not condone it. As a healthcare professional it undermines the trust that a patient  删除换行1 places in them and potentially takes advantage of vulnerable individuals.\n\n【8】You must not use your professional position to establish or pursue a sexual or improper  删除换行1 emotional relationship with a patient or someone close to them.\n\n【9】General Medical Council, Good Medical Practice, 2013\n\n【10】The same reasoning applies to medical students who are expected to establish their own  删除换行1 professional relationships with patients and must learn the importance of professionalism  删除换行1 删除10：<u>(General Medical Council, Medical Students: professional values and fitness to practise, 2009)</u>.\nIn some small villages it can be very difficult to meet people who are not patients. If it looks  删除换行1 like a relationship may be establishing itself then the doctor–patient relationship should be  删除换行1 stopped so that the two roles do not overlap. In its guidance ‘Maintaining a Professional  删除换行5 Boundary between You and Your Patient’ 通用删除7(英):<u>(2013)</u>, the GMC gives further recommendations  删除换行1 about what to do if a relationship is being considered with a former patient. It suggests looking at how long ago the patient had been treated by the doctor and what the nature of the  删除换行1 therapeutic relationship was. For example, it is unlikely that a relationship between a psychiatrist and their former patient would ever be condoned due to the vulnerability of the  删除换行1 patient. The guidance also states that where possible the therapeutic relationship should not  删除换行1 end merely so that an intimate relationship can begin. Special consideration also needs to be  删除换行1 given to the nature of relationships through social media networks (Case 86).\n\n【11】When caring for patients, doctors should keep their distance professionally by not engaging in conversations about their own personal life. They should also dress appropriately and  删除换行1 not wear provocative clothing. When performing intimate procedures they should have a  删除换行1 chaperone with them so that the purpose of the procedure cannot be misconstrued (Case 97).\n\n【12】There are several ethical arguments in favour of zero tolerance for sexual patient–doctor  删除换行1 relationships. These include the premise that sexual relationships will nearly always be harmful to the patient due to the imbalance in power between doctors and their patients. It is,  删除换行1 however, worth considering whether this is still relevant since medical practice is much more  删除换行1 patient oriented and less paternalistic. Virtue ethics argues that a good doctor is one who  删除换行1 extols virtues and that a doctor who commences a sexual relationship with a patient would  删除换行1 not be adhering to these virtues. Consequentialists could argue that any sexual relationship  删除换行1 between patients and doctors would inevitably lead to a breakdown in trust and respect of  删除换行1 the medical profession as a whole and as such should not be allowed as it would reflect poorly  删除换行1 on the profession.\n\n【13】Key Points\n\n【14】• Doctors and medical students must not enter into intimate or sexual relationships  删除换行1 with patients.\n\n【15】• It is unethical to have a relationship with a patient since it jeopardises the trust that  删除换行1 the public has in healthcare professionals.删除个例：<u>Faith, Values and Culture</u>",

        "text": "【0】Question: 2.1 A 6-month-old infant presents with an oral yeast infection and the patient history reveals that there have been persistent infections since approximately 1 month of age. Blood work reveals decreased numbers of T and B lymphocytes, and you thus suspect an immunodeficiency. Which of the following laboratory results would specifically implicate ADA deficiency as the molecular basis for the immunodeficiency seen in this patient?\n\n【1】A. Increased adenosine and deoxyadenosine in the blood\n\n【2】B. Elevated inosine and deoxyinosine in the blood\n\n【3】C. Decreased levels of adenosine and deoxyadenosine in the blood\n\n【4】D. Increased glucose levels in the blood\n\n【5】E. Increased creatinine levels in the blood\n\n【6】Answer: 2.1 A. ADA is responsible for deaminating adenosine and deoxyadenosine, hence, elevations in adenosine and deoxyadenosine are specifically diagnostic for ADA deficiency.\n\n【7】Question: 2.2 With a patient diagnosed with ADA-deficient SCID, which of the following treatment approaches is most likely to be successful?\n\n【8】A. Kidney transplantation\n\n【9】B. Liver transplantation together with immunoglobulin therapy\n\n【10】C. ADA enzyme replacement therapy\n\n【11】D. Immunoglobulin therapy\n\n【12】E. Dietary restriction of adenine\n\n【13】Answer: 2.2 C. ADA enzyme replacement therapy is an approach that can increase ADA enzymatic activity in patients that will lead to a lowering of ADA substrates and an attenuation of the associated phenotypes.\n\n【14】Question: 2.3 Which of the following clinical parameters should be followed in an ADA-deficient patient following the use of ADA enzyme replacement therapy to assess the efficacy of the therapy?\n\n【15】A. Blood urea nitrogen\n\n【16】B. Erythrocyte cell counts\n\n【17】C. Ferritin levels\n\n【18】D. Hemoglobin levels\n\n【19】E. Immunoglobulin levels\n\n【20】Answer: 2.3 E. Diminished immunoglobulin levels are indicative of decreased immune function and are a prominent feature of ADA deficiency. Thus, monitoring immunoglobulin levels is a way of assessing the efficacy of ADA enzyme replacement therapy. An increase in immunoglobulin levels is a positive result.\n\n【21】Question: 2.4 A deficiency of ADA can lead to lymphopenia and immune dysfunction. The accumulation of which substance is most likely to result in these lymphotoxic effects?\n\n【22】A. Adenosine\n\n【23】B. Deoxyadenosine\n\n【24】C. Hypoxanthine\n\n【25】D. Inosine\n\n【26】E. Uric acid\nAnswer: 2.4 B. Deoxyadenosine is the primary lymphotoxic substance that accumulates as a result of adenosine deaminase deficiency. It can be phosphorylated to dATP, an accumulation of which leads to programmed cell death (apoptosis) of lymphoid cells. An accumulation of adenosine also occurs due to ADA deficiency, but it is not lymphotoxic. A buildup of adenosine can lead to neurologic as well as liver, kidney, and lung disorders. Inosine, hypoxanthine, and uric acid are downstream metabolites of ADA and would not be expected to accumulate with a deficiency in the enzyme.\n\n【27】BIOCHEMISTRY PEARLS\n\n【28】 ADA deficiency was the first immunodeficiency disease for which the molecular defect was identified.\n\n【29】 ADA catalyzes the deamination of adenosine and deoxyadenosine to inosine and deoxyinosine, respectively.\n\n【30】 Elevations in deoxyadenosine that occur in response to ADA deficiency are cytotoxic to cells and lead to apoptosis, a form of cell death (in this case loss of lymphocytes).",

        "text": "【0】Question: 7.1 What is the single most important ethical principle to consider in deciding clinical issues?\n\n【1】A. Autonomy.\n\n【2】B. Justice.\n\n【3】C. Nonmaleficence and beneficence considered together.\n\n【4】D. There is no single most important ethical principle. The 4 principles are weighed against one another as they apply to the particulars of a clinical situation.\n\n【5】Answer: 7.1 D. It is tempting, especially in an individualistic culture, to choose the principle of respect for autonomy as the “single most important principle.” However, it is not true that respect for autonomy trumps the other principles. The 4 principles are intended to provide a frame or template of the primary values, which must be considered in determining morally defensible action in health care. Their application to the particular case under consideration provides an opportunity to weigh their relative importance against one another, all things considered.\n\n【6】Question: 7.2 What is the primary reason health care institutions have developed ethics committees?\n\n【7】A. The US federal government requires ethics committees as a way to insure consumer input.\n\n【8】B. In a morally diverse culture such as ours, ethics committees have promoted discourse on ethical issues in clinical care, ensuring discussion about ethical issues in health care from all the stakeholders involved.\n\n【9】C. Licensing regulations for hospitals require ethics committees.\n\n【10】D. Ethics committees grew out of the focus on patient’s rights and are an attempt to equalize the imbalance of power that clinicians hold over patients.\n\n【11】Answer: 7.2 B. Health care ethics committees were borne out of the need for a forum for discourse between the various stakeholders in medical decisions, when technology development created situations in which determining the “right” thing to do or the “good” choice was not clear. Encouraged by legal requirements and accrediting bodies, they were developed to meet the need for moral deliberation in a diverse society with regard to the applications and opportunities of newly developing technology in health care delivery.\n\n【12】Question: 7.3 The purpose of ethics consultation in clinical care is to do which of the following?\n\n【13】A. Provide a “court of last resort” in controversies and conflicts that arise in care of patients.\n\n【14】B. Create forum for venting the frustrations and difficulties of complex acute patient care.\n\n【15】C. Promote an ethical resolution of the problem presented in a particular case by establishing respectful communication among all the parties involved.\n\n【16】D. Clarifying the legal limits and rights to all the parties involved in a case conflict.\nAnswer: 7.3 C. Health care ethics consultation aims to create the space and conditions for respectful dialogue among all the moral stakeholders involved in the care of a patient, including the voice of the patient and family members. In modern health care, it is no longer defendable that the good of the patient is determined solely by the attending physician. Although differences in power and authority continue to challenge our claim of “patient- and family-centered care” and well-functioning and egalitarian “health care delivery teams,” our aim is to attempt to preserve the voice and perspective of the patient (autonomy), the intent and obligations of clinicians (beneficence and nonmaleficence), and, to do this fairly (justice), our human imperfections require the space and encouragement as well as a format for managing our conflicts and uncertainties as we work together for the well-being of the patient.\n\n【17】KEY POINTS\n\n【18】 In a morally diverse society such as ours, a forum is needed to facilitate discourse in situations of moral uncertainty or conflict. The forum that has developed in health care institutions is the ethics committee.\n\n【19】 There has been an explosion of ethical questions in health care due to the development of technology coupled with strong respect in society for self-determination and individual rights.\n\n【20】 Four ethical principles in health care—autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice—reflect the important fundamental values in health care. No single principle can be identified as “superior” or more important than the others in all cases.\n\n【21】 The principle of autonomy relies on the capacity to communicate and reason about choices. When a patient lacks decisional capacity, his or her autonomy is preserved through surrogate decision-makers speaking for the patient.\n\n【22】 Ethics consultation is a function of health care ethics committees. Its aim is to provide a forum for ethical questions in a particular patient’s care to be raised, all viewpoints to be heard, options considered, and a consensus reached in determining next steps.",

During a follow-up appointment, it is noted as she walks into the room that her gait is markedly unsteady. Physical examination is notable for decreased sensation over the upper and lower extremities. Which of the following drugs is most likely causing this patient’s symptoms?\n\n【1】> (A) Ethambutol\n\n【2】> (B) Isoniazid\n\n【3】> (C) Levofloxacin\n\n【4】> (D) Pyrazinamide\n\n【5】> (E) Rifampin\n\n【6】 Answer: The correct answer is B . This patient presents to her appointment exhibiting ataxia and paresthesias, signs of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) deficiency in a patient taking isoniazid. Pyridoxine is the precursor to the coenzyme pyridoxal phosphate, and isoniazid, which is used to treat tuberculosis (TB), inhibits pyridoxine. Pyridoxine plays a role in neurotransmitter production and the conversion of tryptophan to niacin (vitamin B3 ). Patients taking isoniazid without supplemental vitamin B6 can develop neuropathy as well as symptoms of depression, irritability, confusion, and convulsions. Cheilosis (cracks or sores on the lips), glossitis, and stomatitis can also be seen. Vitamin B6 is routinely administered to TB patients taking isoniazid; deficiency rarely occurs in well-nourished adults.  \nAnswer A is incorrect . Ethambutol can be used in combination therapy to treat TB, but it causes optic neuropathy (change in visual acuity or red-green color blindness). Ethambutol is not recommended in children, since visual acuity and changes in color perception are difficult to assess in them.  \nAnswer C is incorrect . Levofloxacin, a respiratory fluoroquinolone, is used as second-line combination therapy for the treatment of TB. Potential toxicities include tendinitis or tendon rupture in adults, and cartilage damage in children.  \nAnswer D is incorrect . Pyrazinamide can be used in combination therapy to treat TB, and it causes hepatotoxicity.  \nAnswer E is incorrect . Rifampin is a first-line therapy used in the treatment of TB, but it does not cause peripheral neuropathy. Adverse effects include GI (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea), CNS (headache and fever), dermatologic (rash, itching, and flushing), and hematologic (thrombocytopenia and acute hemolytic anemia). Patients should also be informed that rifampin causes red-orange discoloration of body fluids (eg, sweat, saliva, and tears).",

More elderly individuals are typically started with a transdermal preparation, titrated to a mid-normal level of TT (approximately 500–600 ng/dL). Intramuscular (IM) testosterone esters (depot) are recommended for patients requiring large doses of transdermal testosterone to reach the goal concentration, such as >4 daily actuations of transdermal gel. Patients should be counseled on how to avoid transfer of topical testosterone to children or women by skin contact.\n\n【6】Alternative Therapies\n---------------------\n\n【7】Aromatase inhibitors (AI) or selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) such as clomiphene and enclomiphene have been used, but they are not recommended due to a paucity of large and reproducible randomized clinical trials. AI are widely used off-label in the USA, but we do not recommend their use because they prevent formation of estradiol, which is important for bone and sexual health, and prevention of accumulation of fat. Similarly, human chorionic gonadotropin or other androgenic formulations have not been sufficiently investigated and should not be used for functional hypogonadism.\n\n【8】Monitoring\n----------\n\n【9】The Endocrine Society guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u> recommend measuring testosterone, hematocrit, and PSA after 3 and 12 months on therapy. Serum testosterone should be measured midway between injections when using IM testosterone esters (depot) or 2 hours after application of a gel. We request a urological consultation in patients with a palpable prostate nodule or induration; PSA concentration of >4 ng/mL, or >3 ng/mL if at high risk, for serum PSA concentration increases of >1.4 ng/mL within any 12-month period of TRT ; or PSA velocity of >0.4 ng/mL/year using the PSA level obtained after 6 months of T administration as the reference 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. We engage all patients in the decision-making of monitoring for prostate cancer and follow the guidelines of the American Urological Association and Endocrine Society. We monitor for the presence of LUTS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u> and refer to a urologist for an increase of IPS score to >19. For patients developing erythrocytosis, we recommend changing to a transdermal formulation, decreasing the testosterone dose, discontinuing treatment altogether, or enrolling the patient in a regular blood donation program. We discontinue the treatment in patients developing a cardiovascular event during TRT.\n\n【10】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【11】The diagnosis of hypogonadism requires characteristic symptoms as well as biochemical evidence of low testosterone. The decision to treat functional hypogonadism in aging male patients requires careful consideration of the risk to benefit ratio and monitoring of symptom improvement and safety parameters.",

        "text": "【0】Case 17\nA 13-year-old African American male patient presents to the emergency depart-ment with pain in his left knee after falling on his side during a soccer game. He is unable to ambulate and is in significant discomfort. His mother states that he has been experiencing several weeks of pain in his left knee before his fall， but x-rays and repeated exams of his knee at his primary care physician’s office had failed to demonstrate any pathology. The patient has no known past medical history. He denies fevers， chills， and recent illness， and he recalls no history of traumatic injury to his left lower extremity. On examination， the child is obese and is com-fortable after administration of appropriate analgesia. His left lower extremity is held in slight external rotation. His knee is without effusion and has a full range of painless motion. Motion at the hip， however， is painful， especially with passive internal/external rotation. He is neurovascularly intact throughout his bilateral extremities. Exam of the right lower extremity is unremarkable. Laboratory studies are significant for a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level of 7.3 mlU/mL(normal 0.6-5.5 mlU/mL). An anteroposterior (AP) pelvis and bilateral frog-leg lateral views are shown in Figures 17-1 and 17-2， respectively.\n\n【1】What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【2】What aspects of this patient’s history put him at risk for this injury?\n\n【3】What is the next step in the management of this patient?\n\n【4】删除3：<u>Figure 17-1.

Frog-leg lateral radiograph of the pelvis.</u>\n\n【6】ANSWERS TO CASE 17：Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis (SCFE)\n\n【7】Summary： A 13-year-old obese， African American male presents with several weeks of left lower extremity pain， exacerbated by a recent fall. Exam demonstrates left hip pathology that is referred to the knee. Additionally， the patient has previously undiagnosed hypothyroidism.\n\n【8】·Most likely diagnosis： Left slipped capital femoral epiphysis.\n\n【9】· Historical risk factors： Obesity， male， African American， adolescence， with concomitant endocrinopathy (hypothyroidism).\n\n【10】· Next appropriate step： Percutaneous screw fixation.\n\n【11】ANALYSIS\n\n【12】Objectives\n\n【13】1\\. Recognize the presentation of SCFE.\n\n【14】2\\. Understand the workup for SCFE and patient population.\n\n【15】3\\. Be familiar with the treatment for SCFE and its potential long-term complications.\n\n【16】Considerations\n\n【17】This is an overweight， African American male adolescent with a history of pain in his left knee. Up to 46% of patients with SCFE will present initially with complaints of distal thigh or knee pain. It is essential to recognize that hip pathology can often be referred to the distal thigh or knee. Complaints of knee pain should warrant complete and thorough physical exam， and typically radiographic evaluation， of the ipsilateral hip. Patients with SCFE typically present with an externally rotated， subtly foreshortened lower extremity， with a markedly decrease range of painful internal rotation.\n\n【18】Hip x-rays should include， at a minimum， an AP view of the pelvis as well as lateral views of each femoral head and neck， typically achieved through a frog-leg lateral view. Although this patient's SCFE is clearly visible on both AP and lateral films， early SCFE lesions are often subtle and are generally apparent on lateral views before they are obvious on the AP.\n\n【19】Patients with newly diagnosed SCFE lesions should be immediately made non-weightbearing on the effected extremity. Complete workup for SCFE secondary to underlying medical conditions should be performed， including initial labora-tory testing for TSH， a complete metabolic panel， and a complete blood count. Patients undergoing potential operative fixation should always receive blood type and screening and coagulation (prothrombin time/partial thromboplastin time) studies.\n\n【20】APPROACH TO：Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis (SCFE)\n\n【21】DEFINITIONS\n\n【22】OSTEONECROSIS： The cellular death of bone， typically resulting from a pro-longed disruption of blood supply.\n\n【23】STABLE SCFE： Defined simply by the patient's ability to ambulate， even with crutch assistance. Less than 10% of patients with a stable SCFE develop osteonecrosis.\n\n【24】UNSTABLE SCFE： Defined as SCFE in patients who are unable to ambulate. These patients have a high incidence of osteonecrosis， upward of 50%.\n\n【25】SCFE (often pronounced“skiffy\") is a disorder of adolescence in which a fracture or， technically， a disruption-occurs through the growth plate of the femoral head. The epiphysis， or region of developing bone above the growth plate (physis)， is therefore mobile and tends to“slip”from the neck of the femur under the repetitive loading of body weight. The“slipping”process is actually a misnomer， however， as it is not technically the epiphysis that slips from the femur， but rather the femur that displaces from the anatomically stable epiphysis.\n\n【26】Epidemiology\n\n【27】SCFE typically affects children between 10 and 17 years of age， occurring at an average of 13.4 years for boys and 12.2 years for girls. Its prevalence in the United States is 10 in 100，000 people annually. SCFE has a slight male-to-female predomi-nance of 3：2 and occurs at increased incidences of 2.2 in patients of African ances-try， 4.5 in those of Pacific Islander ancestry， and 0.1 for North African and Indian subcontinental ancestry， versus 1.0 for white controls. Racial differences are closely related to average adolescent body weights.\n\n【28】Pathogenesis\n\n【29】As stated， SCFE is a failure of the physis， with separation of the epiphysis from the proximal femoral metaphysis. Biomechanical factors such as obesity， femoral retro-version (increased posterior angulation of the femoral neck)， and increased physeal obliquity (an increasingly angulated growth plate that is vulnerable to shearing forces when body weight is loaded) all contribute to physeal weakening. In younger chil-dren， the physis is protected by a perichondral ring that resists shearing forces. This protective ring weakens in adolescence， however， and increases the risk of SCFE. SCFE occurs during puberty， when rapid cellular expansion is occurring at the physeal zone of hypertrophy. Failure is thought to occur at this slightly weakened zone of rapid， immature expansion. Finally， hormonal and endocrine changes are associated with SCFE， but the mechanisms by which they contribute to the disease process are not fully understood. There are data to show that hypothyroidism， growth hormone supplementation， and hypogonadism increase one's risk of SCFE.\n\n【30】Radiology\n\n【31】The direction of a typical“slip”causes the femur to fall into varus， extension， and external rotation. Typically， the epiphysis tends to move posteriorly first， a trans-lation that is most apparent on frog-leg lateral views. With the femurs externally rotated， abducted， and flexed， an unobstructed lateral view of the femoral neck shows early posterior displacement of the epiphysis. For this reason， frog-leg lateral images are considered most sensitive for the diagnosis.\n\n【32】Several radiographic measurements can be made to diagnose and grade SCFE. The Klein line， or a line drawn parallel to the superior femoral neck， should inter-sect the epiphysis in normal individuals. In patients with advanced slips， however， the Klein line contacts the edge of， or is superior to， the migrating epiphysis. The metaphyseal blanch sign of Steel is a blurring of the proximal femoral metaphysis that may be visualized on an AP pelvis film. This is caused by overlapping of the normal metaphysis with the posteriorly displaced epiphysis.\n\n【33】Although several classification schemes exist， the most practical and prognosti-cally relevant classification divides the disease into stable and unstable SCFE. SCFE stability is defined simply by whether or not the patient is able to tolerate weightbearing on the affected extremity. Stability includes those who are able to partially weight bear with crutches. Patients with unstable SCFE are so uncom-fortable with movement of the hip that they refuse to ambulate. Up to 50% of patients with unstable SCFE have an incidence of osteonecrosis of the femoral head.\n\n【34】Intervention should occur as soon as the diagnosis is made. For patients with mild or moderate stable disease， in situ fixation is the method of choice. Attempts to forcefully reduce the deformity are not recommended； however， sometimes the slip will spontaneously reduce or improve when the patient is positioned for surgery. Regardless， the goal or treatment is to stabilize the slipped epiphysis， as remodeling often occurs and patients cntS Can tolerate a certain degree of residual external rota- tion. Single-screw percutaneous fixation is the most common mode of treatment， although double-screw fixation techniques are sometimes performed. For single-screw fixation， the goal is to place the screw through the middle of the epiphy-sis and perpendicular to the growth plate. Patients with stable slips are typically allowed to bear weight after fixation. Bilateral fixation may be indicated in patients with underlying endocrinopathies， even if the contralateral hip is asymptomatic and without radiographic evidence of the disease. Although controversial， some authors also advocate for the prophylactic pinning of the contralateral hip in children less than 10 years of age with unilateral SCFE or in those with open triradiate cartilage. The impetus behind prophylactic fixation of the unaffected hip stems from the elevated rates at which young children and patients with endo-crinopathies develop bilateral disease.\n\n【35】In patients with unstable SCFE， there is significant controversy over whether reduction manipulations should be employed versus in situ SUs 1fixation， whether cap-sulotomy or arthrocentesis should be performed versus no joint decompression， and whether single- versus multiple-screw fixation techniques should be used. Most sur-geons advocate relatively urgent treatment in these patients， as greater than 24 hours between acute injury and fixation may be associated with increased risk of osteo-necrosis. A common treatment regimen for unstable SCFE involves single-screw fixation after joint aspiration to relieve intracapsular pressure and promote vascular perfusion. These patients are generally made nonweightbearing with crutches for6 to 8 weeks postoperatively.\n\n【36】Complications\n\n【37】Osteonecrosis is a severe， debilitating complication， for which risk is increased with unstable SCFE， delayed surgical fixation of acute unstable SCFE， attempted reduc-tion manipulations， and improper placement of pins， specifically in the posterior-superior femoral neck， leading to disruption of vasculature. Osteonecrosis is initially managed with nonweightbearing， nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs， and gentle range-of-motion exercises. When severe， however， reconstructive intervention may be necessary. Slip progression after initial fixation is another potential complica-tion that， fortunately， occurs in only 1% to 2% of patients after single-screw fixa-tion. Although double-screw fixation may theoretically reduce this complication， elevated potential risks of osteonecrosis with multiple-screw fixation favors single-screw techniques for most surgeons.",

China\n\n【7】</u>\nAbstract\n--------\n\n【8】The IVIG resistance defines that patients with KD develop recrudescent or persistent fever at least 36 h after the end of IVIG infusion \\[McCrindle et al. Circulation 135通用删除7(英):<u>(17)</u>:e927–99, 2017\\]. Although IVIG was administered as soon as KD was established within 10 days of illness, approximately 10–20% patients developed IVIG resistance. These patients have an increased risk of CAA compared to those IVIG responders (15% vs. 5%) \\[Tremoulet et al. J Pediatr. 153通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>:117–21, 2008\\]. Thus, identification of children who are likely to be IVIG resistant would allow utilizing additional therapies early in the course of their illness, and thus it would be possible to prevent coronary artery lesions. In 2006, Kobayashi et al designed scoring systems to predict IVIG resistance, risk factors include sodium≤133 mmol/L; days of illness at initial treatment≤4; ALT≥100 IU/L; neutrophils≥80%; CRP≥100 mg/L; age ≤12 months; platelet count ≤300 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L\\[Kobayashi et al. Circulation 113:2606–12, 2006\\]. In 2007, Kuo et al reported that post-IVIG eosinophilia (peripheral blood eosinophils ≥4%) had an inverse correlation to IVIG resistance and pre-IVIG hypoalbuminemia (albumin≤3.0 g/dL) was positively correlated with IVIG resistance\\[ Kuo et al. Pediatr Allergy Immunol. 18:354–9, 2007\\]. In 2013, Fu PP et al established scoring systems especially to predict IVIG resistance in Chinese Children with KD, plus clinical characteristics (polymorphous exanthema, changes around the anus) compared with the previous system \\[Fu et al. Pediatr Infect Dis J. 32:e319–23, 2013\\].\n\n【9】It is reasonable to administer a second dose of IVIG (2 g/kg) to IVIG-resistant patients \\[Sundel et al. J Pediatr. 123通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u>:657–9, 1993\\], high-dose pulse steroids (usually methylprednisolone 20–30 mg/kg intravenously for 3 days, with or without a subsequent course and taper of oral prednisone) may be considered as an alternative to a second infusion of IVIG or for retreatment of patients with KD who have had recurrent or recrudescent fever after additional IVIG \\[Kobayashi et al. J Pediatr. 163通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u>:521–6, 2013\\]. Administration of infliximab (5 mg/kg) may be considered as an alternative to a second infusion of IVIG or corticosteroids for IVIG-resistant patients, cyclosporine may be considered in patients with refractory KD in whom a second IVIG infusion, infliximab, or a course of steroids has failed, immunomodulatory monoclonal antibody therapy (except TNF-α blockers), cytotoxic agents, or (rarely) plasma exchange may be considered in highly refractory patients who have failed to respond to a second infusion of IVIG, an extended course of steroids, or infliximab \\[McCrindle et al. Circulation 135通用删除7(英):<u>(17)</u>:e927–99, 2017\\].\n\n【10】10.1 Case 35: KD with IVIG Resistance-IVIG too Early\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】A previously healthy 2-year-old male presented with unremarkable past medical history and family history.\n\n【12】He presented on Day 5 of illness with a 5-day history of persistent high fever along with rashes and 4-day history of bilateral conjunctivitis. Edema showed on hands and feet after cephalosporin infusion once. On Day 3 of illness he was admitted to local hospital as KD where he received IVIG (1 g/kg/day), furosemide, and methylprednisolone. Rashes were settled down but not fever. On the Day 5, he was transferred to our pediatric cardiology ward. Examination revealed fever (39.9 °C), poor mental state, and delayed response to surroundings. Cervical lymphadenectasis (1.5 cm), bilateral conjunctivitis, red cracked lips with strawberry tongue, and red and edematous palms and soles were present. There were rashes on his face, skin around BCG site, and crissum was red without desquamation. Others were normal. Admission blood test results were listed in Table 10.1 . Echo in local hospital showed bilateral dilation at initial part of coronary artery (LCA 4.1 mm, RCA 4.6 mm). For the boy met all the criteria of KD, he was given oral aspirin (30–50 mg/kg/day), dipyridamole (3–5 mg/kg/day), erythromycin, and third-generation cephalosporin, also polyene phosphorus ester acid radical choline (0.5 g/day) and compound glycyrrhizin (20 mL/day, to protect liver).\nTable 10.1 删除换行 The dynamic changes of Laboratory parameters\n\n| Time  | 3 days  | 5 days  | 6 days  | 9 days  | 13 days  | 16 days  | 19 days  | 22 days  | 6 months  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| WBC (×10 9 )  |  | 9.6  |  | 21.67  | 22.1  | 14.94  | 7.11  |  | 7.4  |\n| NE (%)  |  | 79.5  |  | 75.7  | 77.2  | 55.1  | 36.5  |  | 38.1  |\n| HGB (mg/L)  |  | 100  |  | 99  | 90  | 104  | 108  |  | 127  |\n| PLT (×10 9 )  |  | 252  |  | 799  | 799  | 600  | 363  |  | 305  |\n| CRP (mg/L)  | 74  | 35.6  |  | 91  | 18.8  | 11.4  | 13.3  | 6.58  | 3.76  |\n| NT pro- BNP (pg/mL)  | 2580  | 962.9  |  | 846.9  |  | 80.42  |  |  | 305  |\n| ALT (U/L)  | 103  |  | 75  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| ALB (U/L)  |  |  | 30.2  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n【14】On the Day 6, he was still febrile (>38.5 °C) and dispirited. The neck stiffness was positive. Liver function showed Alb 30.2 g/L, ALT 75 U/L, AST 63 U/L. MP-IgG (+), CP-IgG (+). ESR 60 mm/h. Neck ultrasound revealed bilateral cervical lymphadenectasis, with the biggest one about 2.3 cm × 1.0 cm. IVIG (2 g/kg) infusion was given within 24 h/over 12 h. Mannitol and furosemide were administrated after half of IVIG infusion. On Day 7, the high fever was persistent (39.5 °C) and he was in significant malaise. The lumbar puncture showed CSF pressure was 72 drops/min and CSF was lightly yellow and transparent, Pandy test(+), total cell 238 × 10 <sup>6 </sup> /L, WBC 238 × 10 <sup>6 </sup> /L, NE 17.6%.

Consultation with dermatologist concluded that the symptoms were drug eruption related. All the antibiotics were stopped, compound glycyrrhizin and Claritin plus hydrocortisone emulsifiable paste were used to relieve rashes.\n\n【22】On Day 14, he had cracked lips, and he coughed only once a while but with thick sputum, accompanied with the wheezy phlegm auscultated. He had watery stools twice, rotavirus was tested positive in stool. Oral aspirin and infusion of zithromax were prescribed. Probiotics and bismuth subsalicylate were administrated orally as anti-diarrhea measures.\n\n【23】On Day 15, he excreted yellow thin stools (three times a day), while the appetite loss trivially, urine volume remained adequate. The skin on knees was scratched broken from itching. 1:1 (Glucose: NS) solution was infused to replenish body fluid. On Day 17, his cough subsided but sputum increased with normal body temperature. His stool texture was almost normal. Lumbar puncture was performed again, the CSF pressure turned out to be 60 drops/min, CSF routine revealed total cell 11.00 × 10 <sup>6 </sup> /L, WBC 11 × 10 <sup>6 </sup> /L, NE 9.1%.\n\n【24】On Day 18, he got fever again (38.5 °C), with running nose. Sporadic red rashes appeared on bilateral opisthenar, with pruritus. Membranoid peeling skin appeared around nails. There was white yogurt-like substance in his mouth. He was given interferon inhaled. On Day 19, rechecked brain MRI revealed slight dilation of bilateral paraceles, which make us suspecting he had bilateral mastoiditis. Echo showed normal coronary arteries. On Day 21, his diarrhea was settled down, while the rashes stay unchanged. We reduced methylprednisone to 2 mg/kg/day.

She has not eaten for the last 24 hours and has vomited altered  删除换行1 food and then fluid but no blood on 4 occasions. She has had some looseness of her bowel  删除换行1 motions.\n\n【3】She feels feverish and increasingly unwell. She has no pain on passing urine and no urinary  删除换行1 frequency. Her last menstrual period was 2 weeks ago.\n\n【4】She had similar but much milder pains lasting 2–3 days 3–4 months ago. She has no other  删除换行1 significant past medical history.\n\n【5】She smokes 15–20 cigarettes per day, drinks around half a bottle of wine each night. She has  删除换行1 not used any recreational drugs.\n\n【6】Examination\n\n【7】She looks unwell. Her temperature is 38.8°C. Her pulse rate is 110/min, and blood pressure  删除换行1 102/64mmHg. In the respiratory system there is some dullness to percussion at the left base.\nShe is tender to palpation in the epigastrium and the centre of the abdomen. There is some  删除换行1 guarding, and rebound tenderness around the umbilicus. There is a suggestion of some skin  删除换行1 discolouration in the flanks. Bowel sounds are sparse. Rectal examination is normal; there is  删除换行1 some brown poorly formed stool on the examination glove.\n\n【8】INVESTIGATIONS\n\n【9】Normal\n\n【10】Haemoglobin 15.3g/dL 11.7–15.7g/dL\n\n【11】White cell count 15.2 × 109/L 3.5–11.0 × 109/L\n\n【12】Platelets 412 × 109/L 150–440 × 109/L\n\n【13】Sodium 140mmol/L 135–145mmol/L\n\n【14】Potassium 3.5mmol/L 3.5–5.0mmol/L\n\n【15】Urea 9.3mmol/L 2.5–6.7mmol/L\n\n【16】Creatinine 82μmol/L 70–120μmol/L\n\n【17】C-reactive protein (CRP) 192mg/L <5mg/L\n\n【18】Urinalysis: trace protein; trace blood; nitrites negative\n\n【19】Chest X-ray: small left-side pleural effusion\n\n【20】Abdominal X-ray: normal\n\n【21】Questions\n\n【22】•\t What is the diagnosis?\n\n【23】•\t How would you assess and manage this patient?\n\n【24】ANSWER 41\n\n【25】The most likely diagnosis is acute pancreatitis. This most commonly presents with central or  删除换行1 epigastric pain which radiates to the back. A posteriorly perforating duodenal ulcer may produce a similar pattern of pain. Nausea, vomiting and fever are common and fluid loss leads  删除换行1 to haemodynamic instability and shock. The tachycardia, low blood pressure and haemoconcentration suggest fluid depletion. On examination there are signs of peritonitis. In severe  删除换行1 cases of acute pancreatitis haemorrhage may produce blood staining in the skin of the flanks  删除换行1 (Grey–Turner’s sign) or around the umbilicus (Cullen’s sign). Pleural effusions may occur  删除换行1 especially on the left, or pulmonary oedema. The raised white count and high CRP reflect the  删除换行1 associated severe inflammation in acute pancreatitis.\n\n【26】The most common precipitating causes of acute pancreatitis are excessive alcohol use and  删除换行1 gallstones together, which account for 75% of cases. Other less common causes are hypercalcaemia, hyperlipidaemia, abdominal trauma, drugs such as corticosteroids, diuretics, pentamidine, azathioprine, infections such as mumps, coxsackie virus and cytalomegalovirus.\n\n【27】Diagnosis is based on the clinical picture and raised levels of serum amylase or lipase.\nElevations of amylase can occur also in mesenteric ischaemia and other acute abdominal conditions but an amylase more than 3 times the upper limit of normal with typical clinical features is diagnostic. Imaging such as CT scan can show inflammation in the pancreas but is not  删除换行1 usually necessary. Ultrasound may show underlying biliary tract disease but is less sensitive  删除换行1 in the setting of acute pancreatitis. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) 删除换行1 can also be used in the diagnosis of suspected biliary and pancreatic duct obstruction.\n\n【28】Various staging criteria have been used to grade the severity of acute pancreatitis. The Ransom  删除换行1 criteria are widely used for alcohol induced disease, applied up to 48 hours after onset:\n\n【29】on admission:\n\n【30】•\t > 55 years\n\n【31】•\t WBC count >16 × 109 删除换行1 /L\n\n【32】•\t Blood glucose >10mmol/L\n\n【33】•\t Serum LDH >350 IU/L\n\n【34】•\t AST level >250 IU/L\n\n【35】up to 48 hours:\n\n【36】•\t Hematocrit fall >10%\n\n【37】•\t Urea increased >1.8mmol/L\n\n【38】•\t Serum calcium <2.0mmol/L\n\n【39】•\t PaO2 <8.0 kPa\n\n【40】•\t Base deficit >4mEq/L\n\n【41】•\t Estimated fluid sequestration >600mL\n\n【42】With one point for each item, a score of >2 is predictive of severe pancreatitis and warrants admission to the intensive care unit. Alternative scores such as the Glasgow criteria are often used.\n\n【43】Management is largely related to fluid replacement and analgesia while keeping the patient  删除换行1 nil by mouth. There is often considerable fluid loss retro- and intraperitoneally. Antibiotic  删除换行1 treatment is still uncertain and is not generally used routinely.\n\n【44】Systemic complications may be related to inflammation and fluid loss, acute respiratory  删除换行1 distress syndrome, multiple organ dysfunction, or pancreatic damage producing diabetes. Case 41: Abdominal Pain\n\n【45】Hypocalcameia may occur as calcium is involved in saponification (soap formation) of fats  删除换行1 retroperitoneally. Local complications are related to pancreatic necrosis, secondary infection  删除换行1 and development of pancreatic pseudocysts.\n Differential diagnosis of acute pancreatitis\n\n【46】Other conditions to consider are\n\n【47】•\t Pancreatic pseudocyst\n\n【48】•\t Pancreatic dysfunction (diabetes mellitus; malabsorption due to exocrine failure)\n\n【49】•\t Pancreatic cancer\n\n【50】Although these are common symptoms, they are not always present. Simple abdominal  删除换行1 pain may be the sole symptom. The most common causes are\n\n【51】•\t Alcohol\n\n【52】•\t Gallstones\n\n【53】•\t Metabolic disorders: hereditary pancreatitis, hypercalcemia, hyperlipidemia, malnutrition\n\n【54】•\t Abdominal trauma\n\n【55】•\t Penetrating ulcers\n\n【56】•\t Malignancy\n\n【57】•\t Drugs: steroids, sulfonamides, furosemide, thiazides\n\n【58】•\t Infections: mumps, coxsackie virus, mycoplasma pneumoniae, ascaris, clonorchis\n\n【59】•\t Structural abnormalities: choledochocele, pancreas divisum.\n\n【60】KEY POINTS\n\n【61】•\t The common causes of acute pancreatitis are alcohol and gallstone disease.\n\n【62】•\t The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis relies on the clinical picture and serum amylase  删除换行1 or lipase.\n\n【63】•\t Adequate fluid replacement is an important part of management.",

        "text": "【0】Case 15\nA 64-year-old man is brought into the emergency department (ED) by his family after fainting at home. He was standing， dusting a bookshelf， when he fell back-ward onto the couch. He was noted to be pale and clammy during the incident， and recovered spontaneously in approximately 30 seconds. He does remember the moments just prior to and after the incident. He felt lightheaded and had palpitations just prior to falling， but does not describe any shortness of breath， chest pain， headache， nausea， diplopia， or loss of bowel or bladder control. His history includes a myocardial infarction 2 years prior. The patient has been taking his regular medicines as directed， which include aspirin， a B-blocker， and a cho-lesterol-lowering agent. His primary medical doctor has not recently started any new medicines or changed his doses. On presentation to the ED， the patient’s vitals are blood pressure 143/93 mm Hg， heart rate of 75 beats per minute， respi-ratory rate of 18 breaths per minute， temperature of 37.1℃ (98.8°F)， and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. His examination is significant for a cardiac gal-lop. No carotid bruits， neurological abnormalities， rectal bleeding， or orthostatic changes are noted. A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrates a normal sinus rhythm at 75 beats per minute with no significant changes from a prior study6 months earlier； the ECG reveals Q waves in leads Il， IIl， and aVF. The patient now states he feels fine and would like to go home.\n\n【1】What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【2】What is your next step?\n\n【3】 15：\n\n【4】Summary： This is a 64-year-old man with a medical history that includes a myocardial infarction who presents with an episode of syncope. The patient has an ECG with inferior Q waves， but no acute changes at the time of presentation.1\\. Recognize worrisome historical and physical features of syncope.\n\n【5】2\\. Understand the emergency physician's (EP’s) role in evaluation of patients with syncope， and the role of selective diagnostic testing.\n\n【6】3\\. Learn to recognize which patients need to be admitted to the hospital.Syncope is an extremely common presenting symptom to the ED， accounting for approximately 5% of all ED visits in this country. Between 1% and 6% of hospital-ized patients are admitted for an evaluation of syncope. The list of potential eti-ologies of syncope is extensive； causes include cardiac， reflex-mediated， orthostatic(eg， postural hypotension caused by volume depletion， sepsis-related peripheral vasodilation， or medications)， psychiatric， hormonal， neurologic， and idiopathic. Unnecessary or inappropriate ancillary testing can consume thousands of dollars per patient and increase ED length of stay. With a carefully taken history and physical examination， clinicians can better risk stratify patients and determine who needs to be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and who can be safely discharged for outpatient workup.Orthostasis (ie， a drop in systolic blood pressure of 20 mm Hg or more result-ing from a rapid change in body position from a supine to more upright posture) is another common cause of syncope. Diaphoresis， lightheadedness， and graying of vision may suggest orthostatic syncope， and recurrence of these symptoms on stand-ing is more significant than the actual numeric change in blood pressure. However， orthostasis may be present in up to 40% of patients older than the age of 70 who are asymptomatic.Orthostatic hypotension can be related to volume depletion， sepsis-related peripheral vascular dilation， medications， and autonomic instability， which can develop in a number of chronic illnesses such as diabetes， Parkinson disease， multiple sclerosis， and other neuromuscular disorders. Volume depletion secondary to sudden blood loss needs to be considered in all patients with syncope. Patients of all ages can develop a sudden gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and the initial blood flow can be occult because it is confined to the lower GI tract. Elderly patients can lose massive amounts of blood from a leaking or ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm， with abdominal or flank pain as common associated complaints， but syncope alone can also be the presenting complaint. In the female patient of childbearing age， normal intrauterine or ruptured ectopic pregnancy may present with syncope. The former may cause orthostasis as a result of the normal cardiovascular changes asso-ciated with pregnancy， and the latter as the only manifestation of life-threatening hemorrhage.Much to the frustration of patients and providers， the underlying cause of the syn-copal presentation is not elucidated in approximately half of patients who present to the ED with syncope. Unfortunately， patients in this category represent a mixed population in which it is estimated that anywhere between 45% and 80% may have had a cardiac cause. Most of the young and otherwise healthy patients will be dis-charged home without a clearly defined cause for their loss of consciousness. Many of the elderly patients will be admitted for additional testing and observation. Of all the diagnostic tools available to physicians in the evaluation of syncope， a good thorough history， a physical examination， and ECG are the only level A recommen-dations from the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP). The infor-mation gathered from the history and physical examination alone will identify the potential cause of syncope in 45% of cases.While diagnosis and treatment are the goals in the evaluation of syncope， the decision tree for EM physicians is more focused than that of the specialist or outpa-tient physician 删除33：<u></u>. Unstable patients presenting after a syncopal episode， including those with persistent hypotension， life-threatening dysrhythmias， active blood loss， acute coronary syndromes， hemodynamically significant pulmonary emboli， and cardiac tamponade must be managed emergently. The“ABC”(airway， breathing， circulation) approach to the unstable patient applies in this scenario as in all presentations with unstable vital signs. History and physical examination inSeveral studies have tried to aid the EM physician in identifying high-risk patients by using clinical decision rules . The San Francisco Syncope Rule， the OESIL (Osservatorio Epidemiologico sulla Sincope nel Lazio)， and the ROSE (Risk Stratification of Syncope in the Emergency Department) are decision rules that attempt to provide clinicians with patient characteristics associated with an increased likelihood for an adverse outcome The San Francisco Syncope rule uses five criteria： history of CHF， abnormal ECG， hematocrit <30， shortness of breath， and/or systolic BP of <90 mm Hg at triage， to predict who requires hospitalization. The OESIL score is based upon abnormal ECG， history of cardiac disease， age >65， and syncope without prodrome. The ROSE predictors are： BNP >300， positive fecal\n\n| Table 15-1· SYNCOPE RULES  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Symptoms  | ECG  | Laboratory  | PMH  | Vital Signs  | Age  |\n| SFSR  | SOB  | Abnormal ECG  | HCT<30  | CHF  | SBP<90  |  |\n| OESIL  | No prodrome  | Abnormal ECG  |  | Cardiac disease  |  | \\>65  |\n| ROSE  |  | Abnormal ECG  | Hb<9 Fecal occult bloodBNP>300  |  | O， sat <94%  |  |occult blood， hemoglobin <9.0， oxygen saturation <94%， and Q waves present on ECG. The Rose rule is the first to incorporate a biochemical marker， BNP， into the criteria and claims a sensitivity and negative predictive value of 87.2% and 98.5%， respectively. An abnormal ECG is the only common thread in all three rule sets删除33：<u></u>， although “abnormal\" may be defined in a variety of ways. If the bio-chemical marker BNP in the ROSE criteria is considered a surrogate for a history of CHF， this reinforces that known cardiac disease is a factor associated with high-risk patients. Regardless of which rule set one considers， it should be recognized that decision tools and algorithms should never be used as a substitute for a full evalua-tion and individualized clinical judgment of all aspects of the patient's presentation. Many of these decision rules are still undergoing evaluation in an effort to gain vali-dation. In fact， a recent analysis comparing the efficacy of risk stratification using the San Francisco and OESIL rule sets versus clinical judgment on short-term prognosis found that both rule sets had relatively low sensitivities. Having to use both rule sets would be needed to identify all patients who subsequently died， and the best results were obtained if a clinician used a combination of clinical knowledge with a rule set.Figure 15-2. Predictor variables of risk rules.",

        "text": "【0】CASE 38: FEVER\n\n【1】History\n\n【2】A single 32-year-old Kenyan-born secretary attends your emergency surgery. She reports  删除换行1 that the day before yesterday, she developed some flu-like symptoms with a headache and  删除换行1 muscle pains. She lost her appetite, did not eat dinner and went to bed hoping to sleep it off.\nYesterday, she stayed at home and later that day, she suddenly developed severe coldness and  删除换行1 shivering (rigors) followed by drenching sweats, vomiting and flushing. Once the vomiting  删除换行1 settled, she took some paracetamol and felt a bit better. In the night, she had another of these  删除换行1 episodes and so decided to see the doctor.\n\n【3】Further questioning reveals, she travelled to Kenya 8 weeks previously to attend the christening of her sister’s child. Your computer records show that she saw the nurse before her journey  删除换行1 and was prescribed mefloquine tablets (one tablet weekly to be started 2 weeks before travel  删除换行1 until 4 weeks after return). She admits to taking the first two tablets only as they made her feel  删除换行1 funny. She read the leaflet and became concerned that the tablets might cause her to become  删除换行1 ‘mad’ and then she forgot to take the tablets with her on the journey. She was also worried about taking the tablets because she was hoping to have another child soon. In Kenya,  删除换行1 nobody took tablets and her family does not use mosquito nets. She thought that if her family  删除换行1 was fine, and nobody was using mosquito nets, perhaps the risk for malaria was not so high.\nReturning from the holiday, she felt well and 2 weeks later, she binned the remaining tablets.\n\n【4】Examination\n\n【5】On examination, the patient looks unwell. Her scleras are jaundiced and she has cervical  删除换行1 lymphadenopathy. Her temperature is 39.4°C, resting heart rate 104 beats/minute, blood  删除换行1 pressure 123/87 mmHg and respiratory rate 18 breaths/minute. Her liver is palpable below  删除换行1 the costal edge and tender. The general practitioner is not certain if he can feel the tip of her  删除换行1 spleen.\n\n【6】Questions\n\n【7】• What is your diagnosis?\n\n【8】• How should the GP manage this patient?\n\n【9】ANSWER 38\n\n【10】The patient has all the clinical symptoms suggestive of acute falciparum malaria which, in  删除换行1 its most severe form, include cerebral malaria and has a high mortality rate. The diagnosis  删除换行1 is confirmed by blood microscopy (thick film). In partially treated patients, bone marrow  删除换行1 smears are an alternative.\nAbout 1600 patients return to the United Kingdom from travel abroad with malaria each  删除换行1 year and patients should be strongly encouraged to take chemoprophylaxis. In this case, the  删除换行1 patient was reassured by her family’s seeming lack of perception of danger. While malaria  删除换行1 is a common illness in Africa, conveying a relative immunity to those that have had previous infections, our patient is unlikely to have maintained this immunity while living in the  删除换行5 United Kingdom. For patients born and brought up in malarial areas, immunity develops  删除换行1 slowly and is rapidly lost if the person moves away.\n\n【11】Patients with acute and severe malaria need intense monitoring and observation. A full blood  删除换行1 count might show anaemia, raised white cell count and often thrombocytopenia. Patients are  删除换行1 at risk of hypoglycaemia and the liver function tests might reveal liver involvement. Urine  删除换行1 analysis can show haematuria (black-water fever). Treatment needs the supervision of a specialist, preferably in cooperation with a microbiologist or tropical disease specialist.\n\n【12】• Always include a travel history when patients present with non-specific symptoms.\n\n【13】• A traveller returning from a malarial area and presenting with flu-like symptoms  删除换行1 has malaria until the disease has been ruled out.\n\n【14】• It is important to check compliance with medication.\n\n【15】• Patients born and raised in malarial areas may have a false sense of security about  删除换行1 their immunity to malaria when they return home.\n\n【16】• This is malaria but also has a high index of suspicion for early human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection for anybody with a fever, rash and sore throat.\n删除12：<u>Key Points79\n\n【17】删除测试2：<u>Case 39: Fit Note Request</u>\n\n【18】</u>",

It is abnormal， particu-larly on the chin， sternum， upper abdomen and upper back in women. Terminal hair may normally occur on the arms， legs， upper lips， linea alba and periareolar area in women. To be active in hair follicles， testosterone has to be converted locally to dihydrotestosterone by 5o-reductase. The sensitivity of the hair follicle to androgens is governed largely by cutane-ous 5o-reductase activity. Consequently， similar androgen production profiles may produce different hair growth patterns in different women. Even in hirsute women， hair growth may have greatly variable patterns.\n\n【23】The degree of hirsutism can be assessed by the Ferriman-Gallwey Score， which records distribution and severity of excess body hair on a scale of1-4 for nine regions 删除10：<u>(J Clin Endocrinol Metab 1961；21：1440-7)</u>.\n\n【24】Why do you want to take a menstrual history?\n\n【25】If menstruation is normal， it indicates that there is no increase in testoster-one production. However， if menstruation is abnormal， the commonest cause is polycystic ovary disease (POCD or Stein-Leventhal syndrome)， which is the underlying cause in 92% of the women with hirsutism (the popular belief that most cases of hirsutism are idiopathic is untrue).\n\n【26】ADVANCED-LEVEL QUESTIONS\n\n【27】What other causes of hirsutism are there?\n\n【28】· Cushing syndrome\n\n【29】●Adrenal or ovarian tumours删除31：<u>●</u>\nAcromegaly\n\n【30】Drugs：\n\n【31】those that increase vellus growth： phenytoin， minoxidil， diazoxide， ciclosporin\n\n【32】●those that increase terminal hair growth： androgens.\n\n【33】●Familial\n\n【34】FEthnic： a'male-pattern'of hirsutism is common in women whose ances-tors hail from southern Europe.\n\n【35】What is the relationship between body weight and hirsutism?\n\n【36】Hirsute women are more likely to be obese than non-hirsute women. Therefore， weight loss must be a priority in treating overweight women with hirsutism.\n删除14：<u>Q</u>\nWhat is the role of testosterone in hirsutism?\n\n【37】Testosterone is the most potent androgen and is derived directly from ovarian secretion (60%) and from peripheral conversion of androstenedi-one (40%). About 65% of testosterone is strongly bound to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and 33% is weakly bound to albumin. The remaining 2% is free testosterone and can enter target cells to exert its androgenic effect. Other androgens include androstenedione (secreted in equal amounts by adrenals and ovaries) and dehydroepiandrosterone(derived exclusively from the adrenals).\n\n【38】What is the pathophysiology of polycystic ovary disease?\n\n【39】It is caused by an abnormality of pulsatile secretion of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH)， which causes increased secretion of luteiniz-ing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). This results in hyperplasia of the ovarian thecal cell leading to multiple follicular cysts and excessive androgen synthesis and anovulation.\n\n【40】Remember： POCD is the association of hyperandrogenism with chronic anovulation in women without specific underlying diseases of adrenals or pituitary glands.\n\n【41】How would you investigate suspected polycystic ovary disease?\n\n【42】●Ovarian ultrasonography is the most accurate investigation； typically it shows thickened capsules， multiple cysts of 3-5 mm diameter and a hyperechogenic stroma 删除38：<u>(</u>Biochemistry：\n●Total testosterone levels may be normal， but free androgens are raised\n\n【43】SHBG is low\n\n【44】LH：FSH ratio is raised， usually greater than 2：1， but FSH level is low or normal\n\n【45】●Mild hyperprolactinaemia is common and rarely exceeds 1500 mU/1.\n\n【46】Is glucose metabolism affected in polycystic ovary disease?\n\n【47】POCD is associated with hyperinsulinaemia and insulin resistance， and consequently patients may have impaired glucose tolerance. The site of insulin resistance is skeletal muscle and fatty tissue， not the liver (as in 删除换行1 non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus). It is believed that full expression of POCD requires both the insulin abnormality and the disorder of andro-gen biosynthesis.\n\n【48】How would you treat hirsutism?\n\n【49】● Treatment is directedtowards the underlyingcause of hyper-androgenism\n\n【50】●Mild hyperandrogenism that is idiopathic or mild POCD： oral contra-ceptives\n\n【51】Severe hirsutism： anti-androgens (spironolactone， cyproterone acetate， flutamide) and finasteride (5o-reductase inhibitor) prevent the cutane-ous conversion of testosterone to active dihydrotestosterone； GnRH analogues (leuprolide， nafarelin)\n\n【52】Local treatment： shaving， epilation， laser-assisted epilation (phototri-cholysis)， waxing， electrolysis or bleaching.\n\n【53】IF Stein 通用删除7(英):<u>(1887-1976)</u>， a US gynaecologist， and ML Leventhal 通用删除7(英):<u>(1901-1971)</u>，a US obstetrician 删除10：<u>(Stein IF， Leventhal ML.

        "text": "【0】CASE27\n\n【1】A 45-year-old man with a 15-year history of ulcerative colitis (UC) is evaluated in the outpatient office because of chronic bloody diarrhea over the past 6 weeks. The patient's vital signs are normal. His hemoglobin level is 11.0 g/dL. His current medications consist of prednisone and mesalamine (a 5-aminosalicylate deriva-tive)， and he recently completed a course of cyclosporine therapy 2 months ago for another bout of disease flare-up. The patient has been unable to maintain full-time employment as an accountant over the past year because of UC exacerba-tions. Previous colonoscopy has shown that his disease extends from the rectum to the cecum.\n\n【2】What should be your next step?\n\n【3】What is the best therapy?\n\n【4】ANSWERS TO CASE27：\n\n【5】Ulcerative Colitis\n\n【6】Summary： A 45-year-old man with pancolonic chronic UC that has become refrac-tory to medical management and is causing him significant disability.\n\n【7】Next step： The option of surgical therapy should be presented to this patient. The discussion should explain the benefits， risks， and limitations of surgery versus those of continued medical therapy.\n\n【8】Best therapy： Proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis.\n\n【9】ANALYSIS\n\n【10】Objectives\n\n【11】1\\. Learn with the clinical presentation， natural history， medical management， and complications of UC.\n\n【12】2\\. Learn the indications for urgent and elective operations for the treatment of UC.\n\n【13】3\\. Describe the surgical options and their outcomes for the treatment of UC.\n\n【14】Considerations\n\n【15】UC is a chronic disease with variability in severity and anatomic involvement. The symptoms associated with UC often respond to medicated enemas and systemic pharmacologic therapies. In this case， a 45-year-old man presents with a 15-year history of pancolitis that is producing disabling symptoms that appear to be refrac-tory to medical therapy. The discussion regarding treatment should include medical treatment options as well as surgical options. Surgical resection of diseased colon and rectal segments would drastically improve the gastroinstestinal (GI) symptoms associated with UC. However， the operation would result in permanent changes in bowel functions and body image. It is essential to convey to the patient that surgi-cal removal of the bowel may improve some ofthe extraintestinal manifestations of UC， especially erythema nodosum， arthritis， and eye changes. Another important reason to consider surgical resection in this patient has to do with reducing the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). The risk of CRC increases with the extent of UC involvement as well as the duration of disease. Proctocolectomy with ileal pouch reconstruction is an operation that would improve this patient’s quality of life and reduce his risk for CRC development.\n\n【16】FULMINANT COLITIS AND TOXICMEGACOLON：Fulminant colit is is a con-dition characterized by abdominal pain， fever， and sepsis that develops in the setting of UC but may also occur with Crohn colitis and pseudomembranous colitis. Toxic megacolon occurs when these clinical findings are associated with radiographic evidence of significant colonic distension (transverse colon >8 cm diameter). The cecum is the most frequent site of involvement. Patient can become extremely ill with clinical signs of sepsis， and this condition is highly lethal if not promptly rec-ognized and treated. When identified with either condition， the patient requires prompt fluid resuscitation， broad-spectrum antibiotics administration， and maxi-mal supportive therapy. Roughly one-third of the patients affected will go on to require colectomies.\n\n【17】EXTRACOLONIC MANIFESTATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH UC：：The 删除换行1 extracolonic manifestations may include skin， joints， eyes， and liver. Skin-erythema nodosum and pyoderma gangrenosum are the two most common， and others include psoriasis stomatitis. Joint-peripheral and axial arthritis can occur. Type I peripheral arthropathy is acute and flares with the colitis. Type 2 arthropathy is chronic and typically involves more than six joints and can be migratory. Axial arthropathy manifestation includes ankolysing spondylitis and sacroiliitis， and these conditions can lead to decreased mobility and chronic disability. GI-primary sclerosing chol-angitis，autoimmune hepatitis，and pancreatitis can occur. Eyes-uveitis，scleritis，and optic neuritis.\n\n【18】DYSPLASIA： A premalignant transformation of the mucosa caused by chronic UC. The risk of cancer associated with dysplasia varies depending on the severity of the dysplastic changes. Roughly 40% of the patients with high-grade dysplasia harbor synchronous cancers， and 20% of patients with low-grade dysplasia harbor synchronous cancers.\n\n【19】DYSPLASIA ASSOCIATED LESIONS OR MASS (DALM)： This is a sessile pseudopolyp arising from dysplastic mucosa affected by chronic UC. Fifty percent of patients with DALM have carcinomas within these lesions. Patients with these findings should be recommended to undergo proctocolectomy.\n\n【20】PANCOLITIS： This refers to UC involvement extending from the rectum to the distal small bowel. Patients with this disease pattern have a significantly greater risk of developing cancers in comparison to individuals with shorter segments of colonic involvement. Prophylactic proctocolectomies are generally recommended for patients with pancolitis of significant durations.\n\n【21】UC SURVEILLANCE RECOMMENDATIONS： The current recommendation from the American Gastroenterological Association recommends that patients with at least one-third of their colon involved with UC undergo initial screening 删除换行1 colonoscopy and multiple quadrants biopsies 8 years after disease diagnosis， fol-lowed by subsequent surveillance colonoscopies with biopsies every 1 to 3 years.\n\n【22】ILEAL-J-POUCH： A neorectum constructed from the terminal ileum in the shape of a J. This pouch can then be attached to the anus to form an ileal-j-pouch to anal anastomosis.\n\n【23】CONTINENT ILEOSTOMY(KOCH POUCH)：This is a surgical reconstruction option following total proctocolectomy when there is no remaining anus or rectal sphincters left remaining. The terminal ileum is fashioned to create a pouch with500 to 1000 mL capacity and invagination of the ileum just below the fascia is constructed to provide continence. The pouch is emptied with the placement of a drainage catheter. Because the drainage mechanisms are prone to failure in a high percentage of patients， this procedure is rarely done today.\n\n【24】TOTAL PROCTOCOLECTOMY WITH ILEAL-RECTAL ANASTOMOSIS：The resection involves removal of the entire colon and the majority of the rectum except for the last few cm segment of the distal rectum. The procedure has the advantage of being technically easier to reconstruct； however， the major disadvan-tage is that cancer-prone mucosa is left behind and requires close surveillance.\n\n【25】POUCHITIS： Idiopathic inflammatory process involving the ileal pouch that can develop following J-pouch formations. Patients may present with any number of symptoms， including increased stool frequencies， fecal urgency， fecal incontinence， watery diarrhea， bleeding， abdominal cramps， fever， and malaise. Bacterial over-growth can be a contributing factor for pouchitis. Therefore， most patients with pouchitis improve with a course of antibiotic treatment. Approximately 50% of patients following ileal-pouch reconstructions will have at least one episode of pou-chitis， and 10% to 15% of patients will develop chronic pouchitis.\n\n【26】UC is a chronic， inflammatory condition of unknown etiology. Patients typically present with bloody diarrhea， abdominal pain， urgency， and tenesmus of varying severity with episodes of remissions and flare-ups. Gastrointestinal infections，non-steroidal inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)，and antibiotics have all been implicated in the development of UC. Enteric infections by Salmonella or Campylobacter species have been shown to correlate with disease development. Similarly， the chronic use ofNSAIDs in women is associated with increased risk ofUC. Antibiotic exposure， particularly tetracyclines， has also been linked to UC development. UC appears to follow a familial distribution； however， the risk of first-degree relatives of a patient with UC developing the disease is only 10%to 25%. Unlike Crohn disease， cigarette smoking appears to confer a protective effect against UC development， and smok-ing cessation seems to be associated with disease development. Histologically，UC differs from Crohn disease in that the disease is limited to the mucosa as opposed to transmural in Crohn disease.\n\n【27】The diagnosis of UC is based on typical symptoms and endoscopic evidence of continuous colonic inflammation beginning in the rectum. Occasionally， UC may\n\n| Table 27-1·UCDISEASE SEVERITY  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Disease severity  | Clinical picture  |\n| Mild  | <4 stools/day； no systemic signs； normal inflammatory markers  |\n| Moderate  | \\>4 but <6 stools/day； minimal signs of toxicity  |\n| Severe  | \\>6 but <10 stools/day； demonstrates systemic signs of toxicity；elevated inflammatory markers  |\n| Fulminant  | \\>10 stools/day； with clinical signs of toxicity；abdominal distension；blood transfusion requirement； dilated colon by imag ing  |\n\n【29】Infammatory markers： Erythrocyte sedimentation rate， C-reactive protein. Systemic toxicity： Fever， tachycardia， anemia， and elevated infammatory markers.\n\n【30】present with skipped areas of inflammation in the colon. The anatomic extent of UC can be described as proctitis (rectal involvement only)，proctosigmoiditis (rec-tum and sigmoid colon)， left-sided disease (disease does not extend beyond the splenic flexture)， extensive colitis (disease extends beyond the splenic flexture)，and pancolitis (disease extends all the way to the ileal-cecal valve). See Table 27-1for description of severity of UC.\n\n【31】Treatment ofUC\n\n【32】Treatments generally follow a\"step-up\"approach that is similar to that described for Crohn disease treatment. Patients with mild-to-moderate disease are often treated with 5-ASA by oral， rectal， or both routes. Flare-ups or bouts of disease exacer-bations can be controlled with short courses of corticosteroids treatment (induc-tion therapy)， with transition to nonsteroidal agents once the patient’s disease is under control. Immunosuppressive agents such as thiopurines and anti-TNF anti-body (infliximab) are also effective in inducing and maintaining remissions. Recent observations suggest that the combination of infliximab and azathioprine may be more effective than either agent alone.\n\n【33】Patients who present with fulminant colitis associated with UC need to be closely monitored in hospital settings and treated with intravenous steroids. Gen-erally two-third of the patients will respond to this treatment； however， for the one-third of patients who do not respond to intravenous steroids， rescue therapy with infliximab， intravenous cyclosporine， or surgical resection will need to be expeditiously implemented.\n\n【34】UC is a chronic inflammatory disease that is typically treated with medical man-agement； however， 10% to 15% of patients with the disease may require colectomy either due to refractory disease or complications. Operative treatments for patients under these circumstances generally consist of total abdominal colectomy with end ileostomy formation， and with the removal of significant portions of the dis-eased burden. The patients conditions generally improve. Preservation of the rec-tal segment during the initial operation gives patients the opportunity to undergo completion proctectomy and ileal-anal J-pouch reconstruction when the patients conditions stabilizes. See Table 27-2 for surgical options.\n\n| Table 27-2·SURGICALOPTIONS FOR ULCERATIVE COLITIS  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Surgical Procedure  | Indication  | Advantages  | Disadvantages  |\n| Abdominal colectomywith ileostomy  | Acute toxic colitis：less frequently forother indications  | Less morbidity underurgent settings  | Cancer risk in rectumup to 15%-20% at25-30y  |\n| Abdominal colectomywith ileorectal anastomosis  | For intractability orcancer or dysplasia  | Preservation of bowelfunctions with acceptable results in patients with limited rectaldisease  | Cancer risk in rectumup to 15%-20% at 25-30 y；patients can have continuedsymptoms  |\n| Total proctocolectomywith permanentileostomy  | For intractability orcancer or dysplasia  | All colorectal diseasesremoved with symptom resolution  | Permanent ileostomy  |\n| Total proctocolectomywith ileal pouch-analanastomosis  | For intractability orcancer or dysplasia  | All colorectal diseasesremoved with symptom resolutionand maintenance of transanal continence  | 4-12 bowel movementsper day；some haveday or nighttime incontinence： pouchitis (7%-40%)  |\n| Total proctocolectomywith continent ileostomy  | For intractability orcancer or dysplasia  | All colorectal diseasesremoved with symptomresolution； patients donot require external stoma appliance  | High malfunction rate associated with thenipple valve requiringrevision or urgent can-nulation for drainage  |\n\n【36】Selective Adhesion Molecule Inhibitors\n\n【37】In 2014， the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of vedoli-zumab for use in patients with moderate to severe UC when standard treatments fail. Vedolizumab is the first selective adhesion molecule inhibitor developed. It blocks leukocyte migration that， which is believed to be a cause of inflammation associated with UC. Early observations suggest that this drug is associated with few adverse reactions and does not lead to the increase in infectious risks.\n\n【38】Colorectal Cancer Risks Associated with UC\n\n【39】Patients with long-segment UC have increased risks of developing adenocarci-noma of the colon and rectum. These cancers are different from the usual colorec-tal cancers in that these cancers generally do not develop from polyps. A patient with a UC history for more than 8 years should undergo initial surveillance colo-noscopy with biopsies from multiple quadrants， and subsequent surveillance colo-noscopies every 1 to 3 years. If a surveillance program is not instituted or not feasible， then a prophylactic proctocolectomy should be considered. The classic report of colorectal cancer risks associated with UC stated up to 5%to 10% risk at20 years， and up to 12%to 30%risk after 30 to 35 years of disease； however， recent data suggests that the risks have been generally over-estimated. Factors associated with an increased risk of CRC include diagnosis of UC prior to age 15， duration of disease， anatomic extent of disease， family history of colorectal cancers， history of sclerosing cholangitis， male sex， shortened colon， and the presence of strictures or pseudopolyps.\n\n【40】Surgery for UCPatients\n\n【41】The main indications for surgical therapy in UC are for treatment of fulminant coli-tis or toxic megacolon， the treatment of dysplasia and cancers， and the treatment of medically refractory disease. The most commonly performed operation for the treatment of fulminant colitis is total abdominal colectomy with end ileostomy for-mation. This operation gives patients the opportunity to recover from their acute disease， with the possibility for a second operation where completion proctectomy with ileal-anal J-pouch reconstruction can restore continence. If a patient does not have functional nalsphincters， permanent end ileostomy or continent-ileostomy(Koch Pouch) are the remaining long-term options. Following proctocolectomy and J-pouch reconstruction， most patients experience 4 to 6 bowel movements a day and have occasional minor soilage. Preoperative patient counseling and patient education， and proper patient selection are critical factors for long-term patient satisfaction.",

        "text": "【0】Case 18\n\n【1】An 18-year-old woman， who is wheelchair-bound， states that since she has been suffering from an irregular， staggering gait with frequent falls since the age of 9. Over the next few years， her upper extremity coordination deteriorated， and she developed weakness during her teenage years. Physical examination reveals abnormal eye movements， slow and poorly coordinated movements of all her extremities， and severe weakness of her legs. She has deficits in position sense， vibratory sense， pain， and tactile discrimination. Her deep tendon reflexes are absent. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is present， and she is subsequently diag-nosed with Friedreich ataxia.\n\n【2】What is the mechanism of this disease pathology?\n\n【3】Which pathways are involved?\n\n【4】What are the sensory modalities lost with each pathway?\n\n【5】ANSWERS TO CASE 18：\n\n【6】Summary： An 18-year-old woman has progressive ataxia， lower extremity weakness， and loss of coordination of extremities and eye movements. Examination reveals loss of position sense， vibratory sense， pain， and tactile discrimination. She is diag nosed with Friedreich ataxia.\n\n【7】·Mechanism： The degeneration of nerve tissue in the spinal cord and of nerves that control muscle movement in the arms and legs. This results in the thinning of the spinal cord and the loss of myelin sheaths in many neurons. The leading theory for the pathogenesis of the disease implicates an overaccumulation of iron in mitochondria， leading to cellular damage and death by the production of free radicals in neurons of the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS).\n\n【8】●Involved pathways： This disorder leads to progressive degeneration of the dorsal root ganglia with secondary degeneration of the dorsal and ventral spi-nocerebellar tracts， medial lemniscal system， spinothalamic tract， and lateral cervical system. The corticospinal pathways are also affected.\n\n【9】Sensory modalities lost： The dorsal and ventral spinocerebellar tracts convey proprioceptive (sense of balance and self) information from the body to the cerebellum. The medial lemniscal system conveys information from specialized touch， pressure， vibration， and joint receptors， and proprioceptive informa-tion from the body， to the cerebral cortex. The spinothalamic tract conveys somatosensory information including nociception (pain perception)， tempera-ture， itching， and crude touch to the thalamus. The corticospinal tract conveys motor information from the cerebral cortex of the brain to the spinal cord in response to information generated from many different sensory pathways.\n\n【10】Friedreich ataxia is the most common of the autosomal recessive hereditary ataxias. It is caused by a mutation of a gene on chromosome 9 that codes for the protein frataxin， which is needed for normal function of the mitochondria. This disorder is characterized by neuron degeneration which begins in the periphery， resulting in loss of neurons and a secondary scarring process known as gliosis. Large myelin-ated axons in peripheral nerves are affected progressively with age and duration of the disease. Unmyelinated fibers in sensory roots and peripheral sensory nerves are spared. The posterior columns， corticospinal， ventral， and lateral spinocerebellar tracts are all affected by demyelination. The dorsal root ganglia shrink and eventu-ally show disappearance of neurons. The posterior column degeneration accounts for the loss of position and vibration senses and the sensory ataxia. Absent tendon reflexes in the legs occur as a result of loss of afferent fibers from muscle spindle receptors. The progressive degeneration of the corticospinal pathway leads to limb weakness. Kyphosis and foot anomalies are also commonly seen. Many affected 删除换行1 individuals also have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. While research in this area is progressing， there is currently no effective treatment available.\n\n【11】APPROACH TO：\n\n【12】Proprioception\n\n【13】OBJECTIVES\n\n【14】1\\. Be familiar with the CNS pathways that convey proprioceptive information.\n\n【15】2\\. Understand the clinical symptoms that result from a lesion to the dorsal column pathways.\n\n【16】DEFINITIONS\n\n【17】KINESTHESIA： The sense of movement.\n\n【18】ASTEREOGNOSIS： Loss or impairment of the ability to recognize common objects by touching or handling them without visual input.\n\n【19】ROMBERG TEST： A test in which the patient stands with feet placed closely together and eyes closed. A positive test results if the body sways abnormally or there is loss of balance， indicating a deficiency in conscious recognition of muscle and joint position.\n\n【20】GOLGI TENDON ORGAN： A proprioceptive sensory receptor located in muscle fibers and tendons.\n\n【21】MEDIALLEMNISCAL SYSTEM：The pathway carrying proprioceptive information to the cerebral cortex involving position sense， kinesthesia， and tactile discrimination.\n\n【22】DISCUSSION\n\n【23】Two sets of sensory pathways in the spinal cord provide important information to the brain regarding muscle action， joint position， and the objects with which a per-son is in contact. One of these sets of pathways projects to the cerebellum， where the information is processed for the coordination of movement but not for conscious perception. These pathways include the dorsal and ventral spinocerebellar tracts， the cuneocerebellar tract， and the rostral spinocerebellar tract. The second set of pathways consists of three tracts that project to the cerebral cortex by way of the thalamus. This information is perceived consciously. These are the spinal lemniscus， the spinothalamic tract， and the lateral cervical system. Both sets of sensory recep tors receive information from mechanoreceptors.\n\n【24】Mechanoreceptors located in the muscles， joints， and skin mediate the various separate and integrated sensations of proprioception， touch， and tactile discrimi-nation. Mechanoreceptors consist of Golgi tendon organs， pacinian corpuscles， Meissner corpuscles， Ruffini corpuscles， Merkel cells， and free nerve endings in muscles， tendons， ligaments， joint capsules， and skin. Information about static limb 删除换行1 position is carried mainly through muscle spindle afferents. Kinesthetic informa-tion is mediated by a combination of joint receptor afferents and receptors in the skin， muscles， and joints. Pacinian corpuscles， found in the skin and connective tissue， detect vibration. Meissner corpuscles detect superficial phasic touch. The movement of hairs is detected by free nerve endings in hair follicles and also con-veys a sense of touch. Contrastingly， Ruffini corpuscles detect skin stretch. Merkel cells are specialized epithelial cells that detect fine touch information. Most of the mechanoreceptors are innervated by large-diameter myelinated fibers. The free nerve endings are exceptions as their cell bodies are located in the dorsal root gan-glia， and their central processes enter the medial side of the dorsal root zone. These nerve endings detect pain and temperature. Afferent fibers from mechanoreceptors enter the spinal cord and distribute either to the interneurons and motor neurons in the ventral horn， the neurons in the dorsal and intermediate gray areas where ascending pathways originate， or to the neurons of the dorsal column nuclei in the medulla .\n\n【25】The ventral and dorsal spinocerebellar tracts carry proprioceptive and other somatosensory stimuli from the lower limbs to the cerebellum. Proprioceptive sensa-tion is the perception of the relative position of the parts of the body. Unlike the other sensory systems that allow us to perceive the world outside our body， proprio-ception provides feedback information about the body itself. It consists of both static limb position and kinesthesia， or the sensation of motion. Some proprioceptive fiber collaterals from Golgi tendon organs synapse with neurons in the intermediate gray area and the base of the posterior horn of the spinal cord. At the lumbar and sacral levels of the spinal cord， these neurons give rise to the primarily crossed ventral spinocerebellar tract. This is the most peripheral tract in the ventral margin of the lateral funiculus.\n\n【26】The nucleus dorsalis， or Clarke nucleus， is located at the base of the posterior horn in spinal segments T1 through L2. This column of neurons receives afferents from muscle spindles， cutaneous touch receptors， and joint receptors. The axons of these neurons ascend rostrally and ipsilaterally as the dorsal spinocerebellar tract just posterior to the ventral spinocerebellar tract in the lateral funiculus. While the proprioceptive afferents traveling from dorsal roots T1 to L2 synapse in the nucleus dorsalis at the level where they enter the spinal cord， the corresponding afferents from dorsal roots L3 through S5 ascend first in the fasciculus gracilis of the dorsal funiculus to reach the nucleus dorsalis. They synapse there at levels L1 and L2， which becomes the most caudal level of the dorsal spinocerebellar tract.\n\n| Table18-1。PRESSURE AND TOUCH RECEPTORS AND THEIR FUNCTION  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Mechanoreceptor  | Function  |\n| Pacinian corpuscle  | Sensitivity to deep pressure touch and high-frequency vibration  |\n| Meissner corpuscle  | Sensitivity to light touch  |\n| Merkel cell or nerve endings  | Slowly adapting， provide touch information to the brain  |\n| Ruffini corpuscle  | Slowly adapting， sensitive to skin stretch， and contributes to thekinesthetic sense of and control of finger position and movement  |\n\n【28】The cuneocerebellar tract and the rostral spinocerebellar tract carry information from mechanoreceptors in the upper extremities to the cerebellum. Afferent fibers from C2 to T5 travel rostrally in the dorsal funiculus in the fasciculus cuneatus before synapsing on neurons in the accessory cuneate nucleus in the lower medulla. This is the upper extremity counterpart of the nucleus dorsalis and gives rise to the ipsilateral cuneocerebellar tract or dorsal arcuate fibers. This tract also mediated information from muscle spindles， cutaneous touch receptors， and joint receptors.\n\n【29】The rostral spinocerebellar tract is the upper-extremity tract that corresponds to the ventral spinocerebellar tract. It originates in the cervical enlargement of the intermediate zone of the spinal cord gray area. After projecting to the cerebellum， the tract synapses with fibers of the ventral spinocerebellar tract.\n\n【30】All of the ascending fibers from the dorsal spinocerebellar， cuneocerebellar， and rostral spinocerebellar pathways enter the cerebellum through the inferior cerebel-lar peduncle. The ventral spinocerebellar tract， however， travels through the pons prior to entering the cerebellum through the superior cerebellar peduncle. These four tracts terminate primarily in the midline vermis and intermediate zone of the cerebellum ipsilateral to the cells of origin. There is also a significant projection to the anterior lobe and posterior lobe of the cerebellum that contributes to standing and walking.\n\n【31】Proprioceptive information regarding position sense， kinesthesia， and tactile dis-crimination are carried to the cerebral cortex by afferent fibers from muscle spin-dles， Golgi tendon organs， and mechanoreceptors in joints and skin by way of the medial lemniscal system. This information contributes to conscious position as well as movement sense. The posterior funiculus consists of two large bundles of fibers called fasciculi. Fibers from the leg ascend as the fasciculus gracilis adjacent to the dorsal median septum. Fibers from the arm ascend lateral to the leg fibers as the fas-ciculus cuneatus. The fibers of the posterior funiculus maintain somatotopic orga nization in relation to one another. The fasciculus cuneatus terminates in the lower medulla in the nucleus cuneatus. Similarly， the fasciculus gracilis terminates in the nucleus gracilis， also in the lower medulla. These tracts are frequently referred to as the dorsal column pathways. A portion of the fibers of the medial lemniscal system travel with the lateral cervical system in the dorsal part of the lateral funiculus. The dorsolateral pathway can also be used to describe the entire lemniscal pathway of the spinal cord.\n\n【32】The cells of the dorsal column nuclei give rise to the internal arcuate fibers， which cross to the contralateral side of the medulla in the decussation of the medial lemniscus. From here they ascend as the medial lemniscus to the thalamus and ter-minate in the ventral posterolateral nucleus (VPL). The somatotopic organization of the fibers is maintained in both the medial lemniscus and VPL. Thalamocortical fibers from the VPL continue on to the postcentral gyrus of the parietal lobe and ter-minate in the primary somatosensory cortex. This cortex maintains a topographic representation of the body that is similar to that of the parallel motor strip on the opposite side of the central sulcus.\n\n【33】The spinal lemniscus system mediates the sense of limb position and movement， the sense of steady joint angles， the sense of motion produced by active muscu-lar contraction or passive movement， the sense of tension exerted by contracting 删除换行1 muscles， and the sense of effort. Cortical processing is necessary for the conscious recognition of body and limb posture. The lemniscal pathways also provide impor-tant information regarding the place， intensity， and temporal and spatial patterns of neural activity evoked by mechanical stimulation of the skin. This same pathway to the cortex， therefore， is necessary for discriminative tactile sensation and vibration sense.\n\n【34】The lateral cervical system responds to light mechanical stimulation of the skin on the ipsilateral side of the body. This system is an alternate pathway to the infor-mation conveyed in the posterior column system， and its relevance in humans is not fully understood. The peripheral nerve fibers synapse in the dorsal horn throughout the length of the spinal cord. Heavily myelinated axons from second-order neurons arise in this lamina and ascend ipsilaterally in the dorsal corner of the lateral funicu-lus to terminate in the lateral cervical nucleus. Projections from this nucleus cross the spinal cord in the ventral white commissure to join the contralateral medial lemniscus and proceed with it to terminate in the thalamus. Information from here is projected to the somatic sensory areas of the cerebral cortex.\n\nA bilateral interruption of the dorsolateral pathway in the spinal cord will result in complete loss of proprioceptive sensation. A lesion in this location will produce deficits in position sense， vibration sense， and tactile discrimination. A unilateral injury of a dorsolateral pathway will create ipsilateral symptoms. Lesions within the gracile and cuneate nuclei， the medial lemniscus， the thalamus， and the postcentral gyrus will create varying degrees of similar symptoms. A lesion of the lemniscal path-way will preserve simple touch， pain， and temperature， but it will disrupt proprio-ceptive sensation and result in the following symptoms： inability to recognize limb position， astereognosis or loss of ability to recognize common objects by touching them with the eyes closed， loss of two-point discrimination， loss of vibratory sense， and a positive Romberg sign. In Romberg test a patient stands with his or her feet close together. The amount of sway is noted with the eyes open. The patient then closes the eyes， and an abnormal increase in sway or loss of balance without visual input results in a positive sign. The visual system is able partly to compensate for the deficiency in recognition of muscle and joint positions， allowing patients with dorsolateral pathway lesions to maintain balance with their eyes open.\n删除13：<u>| CASE CORRELATES · See Cases 18-23 (sensory systems).  |\n| --- |</u>",

Pancreatic duplication\n\n【51】ANSWERS\n\n【52】33.1 C. Adenocarcinoma of pancreatic ductal origin is the most common of the peri-ampullary cancers. Cholangiocarcinomas arising from the distal com-mon bile duct is the second most common， and adenocarcinoma of the Ampulla of Vater is the third most common. Duodenal carcinoma is the least common peri-ampullary cancer.\n\n【53】33.2 A. Roughly two-thirds of pancreatic adenocarcinomas are located in the head or uncinate process of the pancreas； 15% are located in the body； 10% are located in the pancreatic tail， and the remaining lesions are diffuse in location. Pancreatic cancers located in the head and unicinate process are the most likely to be curable because of earlier symptom onset.\n\n【54】33.3E. For this patient with obstructive jaundice and severe itching secondary to widely metastatic pancreatic cancer originating from the pancreatic head， endoscopic stent placement can help relieve his jaundice and improve his quality of life. With metastatic disease， there is no indication for surgical resection.\n\n【55】33.4A. This patient has obstructive jaundice and a localized mass of unknown nature in the head of the pancreas and is a candidate for pancreaticoduo-denectomy. The procedure can be both diagnostic and therapeutic for this gentleman providing that he is healthy enough to withstand the surgical pro-cedure. The patient with Childs Class C cirrhosis is a poor surgical candi-date for this operation. Treatment of an isolated duodenal adenoma is local resection. Treatment of a large symptomatic pseudocyst in the head of the pancreas is internal drainage.\n\n【56】33.5A. The majority of patients with pancreatic cancers present with unresect-able disease either because of local advancement or the presence of distant metastases. The prognosis of patients with distant metastasis is extremely poor； therefore， there is no indication to perform liver resections for patients with metastases to the liver. Obstructive jaundice is associated with eleva-tions in total bilirubin with predominant elevations in direct bilirubin values.\n\n【57】33.6 B. Greater than 50% of patients with pancreatic cancers present with locally advanced disease or distant metastases. Complete resections of pancreatic cancers are associated with approximately 15%5-year survival.\n\n【58】33.7B. Whipple procedures with complete resections (R0) can provide patients with the opportunity for cure； however， it is only associated with 10% to 15%5-year survival. The postoperative mortality associated with Whipple resec-tions has improved significantly over the past 20 years owing to improve-ments in operative and supportive care； however， the long-term survival has not change dramatically.\n\n【59】33.8B. Thirty to fifty percent of main-duct IPMNs harbor adenocarcinomas； therefore， pancreatic resection is indicated with this diagnosis. The goal of surgical resection for IPMN is to prevent cancer occurrence. On the other hand， IPMNs arising from minor ducts have a low probability of becoming malignant and do not require surgical removal.\n\n【60】33.9ID. A cystic mass in a patient without a prior history of pancreatitis and with fluid analysis revealing low amylase， low CEA， negative mucin stain，and scant cells most likely represents a serous cystic neoplasm. This is a benign finding with low malignant potential.\n\n【61】CLINICALPEARLS\n\n【62】删除38：<u>)</u>The classic presentation of malignant extrahepatic biliary obstruction is painless jaundice and a palpable nontender gallbladder.The majority of patients with pancreatic cancers have locally-advanced diseases or metastases at the time ofdiagnosis.\n\n【63】In general， pancreaticoduodenectomy should be reserved for patients with resectable malignancies near the Ampulla of Vater. 》 Patients with pancreatic cancers directly invading the superior mesen-teric artery are not considered candidates for surg ical resection because of poor disease prognosis even after resection. High amylase values， low CEA， and negative mucin stain during fluid analysis ofa cystic pancreatic lesion rules out malignancy or lesions with 删除换行1 malignant transformation potentials.\n Endoscopic ultrasound is the most reliable diagnostic modality to evalu-ate the relationship between a pancreatic adenocarcinoma in the head or uncinate process and the superior mesenteric vessels.",

He had no significant medical  删除换行1 history and took no regular medications. There was no significant family history. He was  删除换行1 not sexually active, did not smoke and did not drink any alcohol nor use recreational  删除换行1 drugs. His friends and family were well and he had not travelled abroad for more than  删除换行1 a year.\n\n【3】Examination\n\n【4】This young man was febrile but appeared comfortable at rest. His cardiovascular examination and respiratory system were normal. There was a palpable mass in the right upper  删除换行1 quadrant of his abdomen and he had jaundiced sclera and skin. He had marked cervical  删除换行1 lymphadenopathy. His throat was erythematous but there was no visible exudate.\n\n【5】Initial treatment\n\n【6】He was prescribed an antibiotic (amoxicillin). The following day he developed a florid  删除换行1 rash. The rash is widespread, pink and maculopapular in nature.\n\n【7】Questions\n\n【8】• What diagnoses would you consider in this young man?\n\n【9】• What investigations and further treatment would you consider in this case?\nANSWER 25\n\n【10】This patient has a fever, sore throat and lymphadenopathy. His abdominal examination  删除换行1 revealed possible splenomegaly also. The most likely cause would be a viral illness; and,  删除换行1 in a young adult, infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever) caused by Epstein–Barr virus  删除换行1 (EBV). If there is doubt, other infections, such as HIV, should be excluded.\nIf antibiotics (such as amoxicillin and ampicillin) are given in an oropharyngeal group A  删除换行5 streptococcal infection, a florid maculopapular rash can develop. This is not an allergic  删除换行1 reaction, but the antibiotics should be stopped and the patient observed.\n\n【11】This patient is jaundiced, so liver function tests should be requested, in addition to a full  删除换行1 blood count, renal profile and C-reactive protein (CRP: a marker of infection/inflammation). An acute hepatitis is common in infectious mononucleosis. A heterophil antibody,  删除换行1 such as the monospot test or Paul Bunnel test, can be up to 90 per cent specific and sensitive in diagnosing infectious mononucleosis. Antistreptococcal antibody titres (ASOT) can  删除换行1 also be sent to look for evidence of a streptococcal infection. If the diagnosis is in doubt,  删除换行1 consider an abdominal ultrasound scan to look at the spleen (left upper quadrant mass) 删除换行1 and the liver (jaundice), as well as a liver screen, including hepatitis serology.\n\n【12】Usually, patients with infectious mononucleosis do not require hospital admission, as the  删除换行1 disease is self-limiting; but where there is marked jaundice and deranged liver function,  删除换行1 suggesting an acute hepatitis, a patient may need to be admitted for monitoring. Patients  删除换行1 with hepatomegaly ± splenomegaly should be advised against participating in any contact sports for 4–6 weeks.\n\n【13】KEY POINTS\n\n【14】• Infectious mononucleosis is a common viral disease, typically affecting young adults.\n\n【15】• The viral disease is usually self-limiting but patients can develop a hepatitis, which will  删除换行1 need monitoring.\n\n【16】• If infectious mononucleosis is suspected, amoxicillin and ampicillin should not be  删除换行1 given, as these can induce a maculopapular rash.",

        "text": "【0】Question: A 12-year-old boy who recently emigrated from Nigeria presents with a six-month history of intermittent fever, fatigue, and night sweats. He has a large mass on his right mandible. Biopsy of the mass shows an interspersed pattern of macrophages with sheets of lymphoblasts. The pathogen associated with this patient’s presentation also is associated with which of the following conditions?\n\n【1】> (A) Cervical adenocarcinoma\n\n【2】> (B) Gastric adenocarcinoma\n\n【3】> (C) Hepatocellular carcinoma\n\n【4】> (D) Heterophile-negative mononucleosis\n\n【5】> (E) Nasopharyngeal carcinoma\n Answer: The correct answer is E . Endemic African Burkitt lymphoma frequently manifests as masses involving the mandible (and less often the kidneys, ovaries, and adrenals). Affected lymph nodes show a classic “starry-sky” pattern of neoplastic lymphoblasts and non-neoplastic “tingible body” macrophages. The neoplastic cells typically show a translocation of the c-myc gene on chromosome 8 onto the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene on chromosome 14. It is more common in African children and is associated with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). EBV also is associated with heterophile-positive mononucleosis, oral hairy leukoplakia in patients infected with HIV, lymphoproliferative disorders in immunocompromised hosts (including Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas), and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Interestingly, nonendemic Burkitt lymphoma presents as an abdominal mass and is associated with HIV, not EBV.  \nAnswer A is incorrect . Cervical adenocarcinoma is associated with human papillomavirus.  \nAnswer B is incorrect . Gastric adenocarcinoma may be associated with Helicobacter pylori , but not EBV. Gastric carcinomas, 90% of which are adenocarcinomas, are more common in developing countries than in industrialized countries; they rarely occur before age 40 years; and incidence peaks in the seventh decade with a male:female ratio of 2:1. Gastric carcinoma also is associated with atrophic gastritis, post-gastrectomy states, achlorhydria, pernicious anemia, Ménétrier’s disease, and adenomatous polyps.  \nAnswer C is incorrect . Hepatocellular carcinoma is associated with chronic HBV and HCV infections. Other noninfectious associations with hepatocellular carcinoma include cirrhosis (secondary to alcohol, or cryptogenic), hemochromatosis, aflatoxin ingestion, and α1 \\-antitrypsin deficiency.  \nAnswer D is incorrect . Heterophile-negative mononucleosis is associated with cytomegalovirus, acute HIV, toxoplasmosis, and human herpesvirus types 6 and 7. Although heterophile-negative mononucleosis may present with similar symptoms of fever and lymphadenopathy without pharyngitis (as in this case), these infectious agents typically would not result in the large mass on the right mandible. Heterophile-positive mononucleosis is associated with EBV.",

The mother has noticed her daughter scratching and rubbing her anal area frequently for the past few days. Her anal area has been getting red and raw from all the scratching. Her mother has used some petrolatum (petroleum jelly) and hydrocortisone cream, but it has not helped much. The child has not had any obvious skin rashes and is not scratching any other part of her body. She has not had diarrhea. She takes no medications and has no significant medical history. She attends day care 4 days a week. On examination, she is a well-appearing child. Her vital signs and general examination are normal. Examination of her perianal area reveals some erythema and excoriation from scratching. You perform a microscopic examination of a sample collected by touching the perianal region with a piece of clear cellophane tape.\n\n【3】 What diagnostic finding are you likely to see on this microscopic examination?\n\n【4】 What is the organism responsible for this infection?\n\n【5】### ANSWERS TO CASE 47:\n\n【6】#### Enterobiasis or Pinworm Infection\n\n【7】Summary: A 4-year-old girl has perianal pruritus. The diagnosis is made by microscopic examination of a sample collected by touching the perianal region with a piece of clear cellophane tape.\n\n【8】• Diagnostic finding likely to see on this microscopic examination: Thin-walled, ovoid eggs flattened on one side and contain a nematode larva.\n\n【9】• Organism responsible for this infection: Enterobius vermicularis .\n\n【10】### CLINICAL CORRELATION\n\n【11】E. vermicularis , commonly called the pinworm, is the most common cause of helminthic infections in the United States and is endemic around the world. Humans are the only known host for E. vermicularis , but other vertebrates can be infected with different species of this nematode. Adult worms, approximately 1 cm in length, white and thread-like in appearance, inhabit the large intestine. Gravid females migrate to the perianal and perineal regions at night to lay eggs that are immediately infective. Infection is more common in children than adults and is often asymptomatic. However, a variety of symptoms are ascribed to pinworms. Atypically, worms are sometimes found in an inflamed appendix, and there are rare reports of worms reaching the genital tract and producing vaginitis. By far the most common signs of infection occur in children and include restless sleep and tiredness during the day. However, more common symptoms consist of anal or perianal itching because of the adult worms crawling on the skin. The eggs can also cause local itching, which may be more intense in secondary infections as a result of allergic reactions to their antigenic coating. Frequent scratching results in transfer to the hands and areas under the fingernails. Eggs are frequently transferred to clothing, bedding, toys, and dust, where they can survive for several weeks. Through hand-to-mouth transmission, the eggs are ingested and hatch in the duodenum. Larvae released from eggs reside in the cecum and reach adult stage in about a month. Infections are acute, generally lasting 4 to 8 weeks. Considering the relatively short duration of a single infection, chronic enterobiasis is caused by reinfection.\n\n【12】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【13】#### The Suspected Enterobius Infection\n\n【14】### OBJECTIVES\n\n【15】1\\. Learn the life cycle of E. vermicularis and the epidemiology and clinical course of infection.\n\n【16】2\\. Describe 3 basic aspects of infection: transmission, diagnosis, and treatment/prevention.\n\n【17】### DEFINITIONS\n\n【18】PINWORM: Common name for E. vermicularis\n\n【19】CERVICAL ALAE: An extension of a lateral cuticular protuberance or lateral line on the body surface of the pinworm that extends to the head region and appears microscopically as a “flared” region or collar. Adult worms are identified, in part, by the presence of cervical alae, which are prominent structures when examined microscopically\n\n【20】NOCTURNAL MIGRATION: Refers to the tendency of pinworms to migrate at night from the colon, out the anus, to the perianal and perineal regions to deposit eggs\n\n【21】LARVATED EGG: Refers to eggs that contain a larval stage and are deposited by pinworms on the skin\n\n【22】### DISCUSSION\n\n【23】Characteristics of Enterobiasis That Impact Transmission\n\n【24】A patient acquires infection by ingesting the pinworm eggs containing infective larvae. Ingested eggs hatch in the small intestine, releasing larvae that migrate to the cecal area and mature into adult male and female worms that are free or insecurely attached to the mucosa. The period between ingestion of eggs to maturation takes approximately 3 to 4 weeks. Following copulation, the female pinworms produce eggs. Rather than release eggs in the bowel, the female worms migrate out the anus onto the surrounding skin and release eggs. Worm migration usually occurs at night. Each female will lay thousands of microscopic, larvated eggs. Pinworm eggs are infective within a few hours after being deposited on the skin. They can survive up to 2 weeks on clothing, bedding, or other objects. Individuals can become infected after accidentally swallowing infective pinworm eggs from contaminated surfaces or fingers. The duration of a single infection is 4 to 8 weeks.\n\n【25】### DIAGNOSIS\n\n【26】Although Enterobius is an intestinal parasite, eggs are rarely found during laboratory examinations of stools. If a person is suspected of having pinworms, then the so-called “scotch tape test” should be used to identify the parasite. Transparent adhesive tape, sometime attached to the end of tongue depressor or “pinworm paddle,” is pressed in the anal region. This procedure involves the help of a patient or parents of suspected children. The tape is then transferred to a glass slide, sticky side down. The slide should then be examined microscopically for eggs. Pinworm eggs are approximately 20 × 50 μm and are characteristically flattened on one side and usually contain an active larva. Because bathing or having a bowel movement may remove eggs, the scotch tape impression should be made on awakening in the morning. In children, samples taken from under the fingernails may also contain eggs because scratching of the anal area is common.\n\n【27】A definitive diagnosis may also be made on recovery and identification of adult worms seen directly in bed sheets or around the anal area. The female pinworm has a sharply pointed tail and anterior cervical alae that form a collar-like structure around the mouth. The female worm is about 1 cm long with a diameter of approximately 0.5 mm. In female worms that are gravid, the uterus filled with easily identifiable eggs is a common feature.\n\n【28】### TREATMENT AND PREVENTION\n\n【29】Highly effective drugs in the treatment of enterobiasis are mebendazole (first line) and pyrantel pamoate, which is preferred in pregnancy, given as a single dose, with a repeat dose administered 2 weeks later. Mebendazole is a broad-spectrum antinematode agent with a high therapeutic index. Close family contacts of infected individuals should also be treated. If reinfection occurs, then the source of the infection should be identified. Therefore, playmates, schoolmates, close contacts outside the house, and household members should be considered. Each infected person should receive the 2-dose treatment and, if necessary, more than 2 doses. In short, the importance of determining infection in the entire family and contacts should be explained in terms of the life cycle of the worm. Personal and group hygiene should be stressed.\n\n【30】### SYNPNOSIS\n\n【31】The synopsis of enterobiasis is presented in Table 47-1 .\n删除4：<u>Table 47-1 • SYNOPSIS OF ENTEROBIASIS</u>\n\n【32】###",

        "text": "【0】Question: A worried mother brings her infant to the emergency department because he appears to be unable to swallow and continues to choke on his formula. On physical examination, the physician notes generalized muscle weakness. On further questioning, the patient’s mother says that she recently started sweetening the baby’s food with honey. Which of the following is a characteristic of the organism most likely responsible for this infant’s symptoms?\n\n【1】> (A) Production of IgA protease\n\n【2】> (B) Production of exotoxin A\n\n【3】> (C) Production of lecithinase\n\n【4】> (D) Production of lipopolysaccharide\n\n【5】> (E) Production of spores that can only be killed by autoclaving\n\n【6】 Answer: The correct answer is E. This describes all spore-forming bacteria, which include Bacillus anthracis, Bacillus cereus , and Clostridium . However, only Clostridium botulinum produces the symptoms seen in this baby and also fits the mode of transmission. C botulinum causes botulism via the production of a heat-labile toxin that inhibits the release of acetylcholine into the neuromuscular junction. Infants may initially become constipated and then develop generalized muscle weakness (“floppy baby”). The organism is spread through the ingestion of contaminated canned or bottled food. Additionally, fresh honey has been shown to harbor the organism.  \nAnswer A is incorrect. IgA protease is produced by some bacteria so they can cleave secretory IgA and colonize mucosal areas; Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae , and Haemophilus influenzae are the most well known. However, none of these are typically transmitted via food, namely honey.  \nAnswer B is incorrect. Exotoxin A is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as some Streptococcus species. Exotoxin A has been associated with toxic shock syndrome and scarlet fever. However, none of these organisms produce the symptoms seen in this case or is transmitted by honey ingestion.  \nAnswer C is incorrect. Lecithinase is produced by Clostridium perfringens and is responsible for the development of gas gangrene, cellulitis, and diarrhea. This organism is associated with contaminated wounds, which is not a part of this baby’s history.  \nAnswer D is incorrect. Lipopolysaccharide, also called endotoxin, is produced by gramnegative bacteria and Listeria . It is highly anti-genic and can cause sepsis in severe infections. However, generalized muscle weakness is not characteristic of sepsis.",

Renal tract ultrasound, however, can be difficult to interpret in pregnancy as physiological dilatation of the ureters occurs from pressure from the uterus.\n\n【27】Management\n\n【28】Intravenous antibiotics should be started, usually cephalosporins, until culture and sensitivities are available, with regular paracetamol to control the temperature and pain. It may 删除换行1 take several days for the temperature to settle and for the woman’s pain and symptoms to 删除换行1 resolve, but improvement should be monitored with daily white blood count, C-reactive 删除换行1 protein and urea and electrolytes. Intravenous rehydration is needed as the woman is 删除换行1 vomiting and pyrexial with raised urea, suggesting dehydration.\n\n【29】After completion of treatment (total 2 weeks) a repeat urine culture is needed to confirm 删除换行1 cure. Some women with recurrent infection need a daily prophylactic antibiotic regime.\n\n【30】Effect on the pregnancy\n\n【31】Maternal sepsis is a risk for miscarriage and preterm labour, so treatment should not be 删除换行1 delayed.

It is estimated to be at 8 per 10 000 in Wessex UK 删除10：<u>(Lancet1998；351：1490)</u>.\n\n【33】What are the diagnostic criteria for tuberous sclerosis?\n\n【34】Major and minor criteria exist to diagnose tuberous sclerosis 删除10：<u>(J Child Neurol 1998； 13：624-8)</u>. The diagnosis is made when two major features， or one major and two minor ones， can be shown. In one series of patients >90% had skin lesions， about 90% had symptoms of cerebral pathology， 70-90% had renal abnormalities and about 50% had retinal hamartomas.\n\n【35】Major features：\n\n【36】Facial angiofibromas or forehead plaque pits in dental enamel\n\n【37】Non-traumatic ungula or periungual fibroma\n\n【38】Hypomelanotic macules (three or more)\n\n【39】Shagreen patch (connective tissue nevus) migration lines\n\n【40】NMultiple retinal nodular hamartomas\nCortical tuber\n\n【41】Subependymal nodule\n\n【42】●Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma\n\n【43】● Cardiac rhabdomyoma， single or multiple\n\n【44】·Lymphangiomyomatosis， renal angiomyolipoma， or both.\n\n【45】Minor features：\nMultiple， randomly distributed lesions\n\n【46】Hamartomatous rectal polyps\n\n【47】Bone cysts\n\n【48】·CCerebral white matter radial\n\n【49】●Gingival fibromas\n\n【50】Non-renal hamartoma\n\n【51】C Retinal achromic patch\n·Confetti-like skin lesions\n\n【52】Multiple renal cysts.\n\n【53】How would you manage such patients?\n\n【54】Symptomatically， withanticonvulsanttherapyforseizuresS 2 and genetic counselling. When severe epilepsy and mental retardation is present， the prognosis for life beyond the third decade is poor. Death is usually from seizures， associated neoplasms or intercurrent illness.\n\n【55】Long-term follow-up includes the monitoring of lesion growth. No conclusive guidelines for surveillance have been established. The growth of angiomyolipomas or subependymal giant cell tumours requires regular follow-up. Periodic imaging of the brain and abdomen to monitor the growth of lesions in the brain and kidney should occur at least every 3 years and more often in patients with lesions that have progressive growth. Annual MRI of the brain is suggested until patients are at least 21 years of age， and then MRI should be done every 2 to 3 years both to diagnose and to monitor subependymal giant cell tumours. Annual ultrasonography， MRI or CT is indicated in patients with multiple angiomyolipomas or a single lesion that is progressive.\n\n【56】Lymphangiomyomatosis： yearly pulmonary function testing may be useful to monitor lung function； some patients may require more fre-quent assessments.\n\n【57】200Tuberous sclerosis (Bourneville's or Pringle's disease)\n\n【58】●Electroencephalography can determine background cerebral activity and characterize patterns such as hypsarrhythmia in infantile spasms.\n\n【59】● Regular dermatologic evaluation is required since facial angiofibromas can cause cosmetic disfiguration and ultimately the lesions will require laser therapy or surgical removal.\n\n【60】Are you aware of any therapies currently being evaluated?\n\n【61】●The discovery of upregulation of the 'mammalian target of rapamycin'(mTOR) pathway in tumours associated with tuberous sclerosis presents new possibilities for therapy. Interferon-y and interferon-o interact with mTOR， leading to deactivation of the translational repressor 4E-BP1， which could be beneficial for therapy.\n\n【62】Sirolimus therapy causes the dysregulated mTOR pathway to return to normal in cells that lack hamartin or tuberin (encoded by the genes TSC1 or TSC2， respectively). Sirolimus is effective in diminishing the volume of lesions in patients with renal angiomyolipomas， subependy-mal giant cell astrocytomas and sporadic lymphangio leiomyomatosis. However， angiomyolipomas increased in volume after the sirolimus was discontinued， and some patients taking sirolimus experienced serious adverse events. Another concern is that sirolimus therapy may restore the cell’s ability to activate AKT， suggesting that long-term treatment may increasethe risk of malignanttumourslinntthese patients.\n\n【63】Genetic counselling should be recommended to patients to aid with family planning. It is an autosomal dominant disorder； therefore， those affected should be advised that the risk of having an affected child is approximately 50%\n\n【64】Do you know on which chromosome the gene is localized?\n\n【65】Tuberous sclerosis is an autosomal dominant disorder， although two-thirds of patients have sporadic mutations. The genes in which abnormali-ties are found are called TSC1 and TSC2. Both have been studied by multigenerational linkage analysis and have been localized to chromo-some 9 (TSC1) 删除10：<u>(Science 1997；277：805-8)</u> and chromosome 16 (TSC2) 删除10：<u>(Cell1993；75：1305-15)</u>.\n\n【66】What do you know about the benign metastasis hypothesis? The ‘benign metastasis' hypothesis for the pathogenesis of lymphangi-omyomatosis proposes that histologically benign cells with mutations in TSC1 or TSC2 may have the ability to travel to the lungs from angiomyol-ipomas in the kidney.\n\n【67】What do you know about the pathogenesis of tuberous sclerosis?\n\n【68】Several downstream protein cascades from tuberin and hamartin might be affected， for example the mTOR pathway， which detects signals of nutrient availability， hypoxia or growth factor stimulation. The mTOR pathway is stimulated by a small G-protein of the Ras superfamily RHEB (Ras homo-logue enriched in brain). Rheb is active when bound to GTP. Tuberin and hamartin form intracellular complexes that activate GTPase， thus reducing the stimulation of mTOR. Whether Rheb is the sole downstream effector or whether mTOR is the only clinically relevant target of Rheb remains to be characterized.\n删除36：<u>DM Bourneville 通用删除7(英):<u>(1840-1909)</u>， a French neurologist described tuberous sclerosis in 1880 删除10：<u>(Bourneville， DM.

She has had a fairly severe headache for the last 3 weeks (she rates it as an 8 on a scale of 1-10). She describes the pain as constant, occasionally throbbing but mostly a dull ache, and localized to the right side of her head. She thinks the pain is worse at night, especially when she lies with that side of her head on the pillow. She has had no nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or other visual disturbances. She has had headaches before, but they were mostly occipital and frontal, which she attributed to “stress,” and they were relieved with acetaminophen. Her medical history is significant for hypertension, which is controlled with hydrochlorothiazide, and “arthritis” of her neck, shoulders, and hips for which she takes ibuprofen when she feels stiff and achy. On physical examination, her temperature is 100.4°F, heart rate 88 bpm, blood pressure 126/75 mm Hg, and respiratory rate 12 breaths per minute. Her visual acuity is normal, visual fields are intact, and her funduscopic examination is significant for arteriolar narrowing but no papilledema or hemorrhage. She has moderate tenderness over the right side of her head but no obvious scalp lesions. Her chest is clear, and her heart rhythm is regular, with normal S <sub>1 </sub> and S <sub>2 </sub> but an S <sub>4 </sub> gallop. Abdominal examination is benign. She has no focal deficits on neurologic examination. She has no joint swelling or deformity but is tender to palpation over her shoulders, hips, and thighs.\n\n【3】 What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【4】 What is the best next step to confirm the diagnosis?\n\n【5】### ANSWERS TO CASE 50:\n\n【6】#### Headache/Temporal Arteritis\n\n【7】Summary: A 59-year-old woman complains of a 3-week history of severe right-side headaches that are worse at night, when she lies with that side of her head on the pillow. Her medical history is significant for hypertension and “arthritis” of her neck, shoulders, and hips, for which she takes ibuprofen. She has a temperature 100.4°F and normal neurologic and eye examinations. She has moderate tenderness over the right side of her head but no obvious scalp lesions.\n\n【8】 Most likely diagnosis: Giant cell (temporal) arteritis (GCA)\n\n【9】 Best next diagnostic step: Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)\n\n【10】#### ANALYSIS\n\n【11】##### Objectives\n\n【12】1\\. Be familiar with the clinical features that help to distinguish a benign headache from one representing a serious underlying illness.\n\n【13】2\\. Know the clinical features and diagnostic tests for GCA.\n\n【14】3\\. Know the clinical features of migraine and cluster headaches and of subarachnoid hemorrhage.\n\n【15】##### Considerations\n\n【16】Although headaches are a very common complaint, this patient has features that are of greater concern: older age of onset, abrupt onset and severe intensity, and dissimilarity to previous milder headaches. These are three of the nine factors of concern for significant underlying pathology outlined in Table 50–1 . She is very concerned about the headaches and is worried that they indicate a brain tumor. She has no meningeal signs, and her neurologic examination is nonfocal. She has stiffness and achiness of the shoulder and hip girdles. Together these factors make the diagnosis of GCA a strong possibility. GCA usually has its onset in patients aged 50 years or older (females more than males), and involves inflammation of the medium- or large-size vessels. Her low-grade fever and generalized body aches may represent polymyalgia rheumatica, which is closely associated with GCA. The diagnosis would be suggested by an elevated ESR, and then confirmed by temporal artery biopsy. Although GCA is not a common cause of headache, untreated patients often progress to permanent visual loss as a consequence of involvement of the ophthalmic artery, so a high index of suspicion is necessary to begin investigation. An elevated ESR necessitates further diagnostic testing, such as a temporal artery biopsy. In the meantime, empiric corticosteroids may help prevent complications.\n\n【17】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【18】#### Headaches\n\n【19】#### DEFINITIONS\n\n【20】TEMPORAL ARTERITIS: Also known as giant cell arteritis (GCA), temporal arteritis is a common form of systemic vascular inflammation affecting patients older than 50 years. Medium- and large-sized vessels, especially the superficial temporal artery, are affected.\n\n【21】BERRY ANEURYSM: A small outpouching that looks like a berry and classically occurs at the point at which a cerebral artery departs from the circular artery (the circle of Willis) at the base of the brain. They can rupture, causing subarachnoid hemorrhage.\n\n【22】#### CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【23】Headache is one of the most common complaints of patients in the Western world. It periodically afflicts 90% of adults, and almost 25% have recurrent severe headaches. As with many common symptoms, a broad range of conditions, from trivial to life-threatening, might be responsible. The majority of patients presenting with headache have tension-type, migraine, or cluster ; however, fewer than 1 in 20 have significant underlying pathology. Because headache symptoms usually are accompanied by a paucity of associated findings, including those on laboratory examination, the clinician must depend largely upon a thorough history with a general and focused neurologic examination as the initial workup. Careful inquiry and meticulous physical examination, keeping in mind the “red flags” of headaches 删除25：<u></u>, will serve the clinician well. Differentiating serious underlying causes of headache from more benign causes may be difficult. Table 50–2 lists some typical features of serious causes of headache.\n删除4：<u>Table 50-1. RED FLAGS FOR SECONDARY HEADACHE DISORDERS</u>\n\n【24】Fundamental change or progression in headache pattern\n\n【25】First severe and/or worst headache\n\n【26】Abrupt-onset attacks, including those awakening one from sleep\n\n【27】Abnormal physical examination findings (general or neurologic)\n\n【28】Neurologic symptoms lasting >1 h\n\n【29】New headache in individuals aged <5 y or >50 y\n\n【30】New headache in patients with cancer, immunosuppression, pregnancy\n\n【31】Headache associated with alteration in or loss of consciousness\n\n【32】Headache triggered by exertion, sexual activity, or Valsalva maneuver\n删除4：<u>Table 50–2 • CAUSES OF HEADACHE</u>\n\n【33】One of the most catastrophic secondary causes of headache is subarachnoid hemorrhage , usually secondary to a ruptured intracerebral (berry) aneurysm. Up to 4% of patients presenting to an emergency center with severe headache, or the classic “worst ever headache,” have a subarachnoid bleed. The initial hemorrhage may be fatal, may result in severe neurologic impairment, or may produce only minor symptoms such as headache. A high index of suspicion is needed because no neurologic findings may be present initially, and the patient who will benefit the most from intervention will often have the mildest symptoms. The first diagnostic study should be a noncontrast CT scan with thin imaging cuts at the region of the brain base. This study will be positive in more than 90% of cases on the first day, with decreasing sensitivity over the next several days. If hemorrhage is suspected but the CT is negative, lumbar puncture should be performed as soon as possible to assess for the presence of red cells or xanthochromia (yellowish discoloration of cerebrospinal fluid \\[CSF\\]); this finding indicates presence of bilirubin and differentiates subarachnoid hemorrhage from a traumatic lumbar puncture.\n\n【34】Giant cell arteritis, or temporal arteritis , is a chronic vasculitis of large- and medium-size vessels, usually involving the cranial branches of the arteries arising from the aortic arch. The clinical criteria for diagnosis include age of onset older than 50 years, new onset or type of headache pattern, tenderness or decreased pulsation of the temporal artery, elevated ESR, and abnormal findings on biopsy of the temporal artery. The presence of three or more criteria yields more than 90% sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis. GCA is closely related to polymyalgia rheumatica , an inflammatory condition characterized by bilateral aching and stiffness of neck, torso, shoulders, or thighs, with a significantly elevated ESR. Both conditions probably are polygenic diseases in which various environmental and genetic factors influence susceptibility and severity. Clinical symptoms may include jaw claudication, and the most worrisome complication is permanent or partial loss of vision in one or both eyes, which can occur as an early manifestation in up to 20% of patients. Temporal artery biopsy is recommended in all patients suspected of having GCA, and long segments of the artery may require excision in order to find the typical areas of segmental inflammation. Corticosteroids are the drugs of choice to treat both polymyalgia rheumatica and GCA, with daily doses of 10 to 20 mg of prednisone for polymyalgia rheumatica and 40 to 60 mg for GCA. Steroids may prevent, but usually do not reverse, visual loss. Steroid dosage is gradually tapered, but relapse is common, as are complications of corticosteroid therapy.\n\n【35】Migraine headache is much more common than GCA but is more variable in its presentation. It is the most common cause of initial clinic visits for headache because of its frequency, disabling qualities, and associated multiorgan symptoms. Migraine attacks are more common in women than in men. Migraine attacks may or may not have a preceding aura, may be unilateral or bilateral, and may have either throbbing or nonpulsatile pain, including the neck. They may have cranial autonomic features such as tearing or nasal congestion, leading to the misdiagnosis of sinus disease. A number of evidence-based guidelines are available for managing migraine headaches. In general, preventive therapies include tricyclic antidepressants and beta-blockers. Treatment of acute episodes involves the initial use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), followed by dihydroergotamine or sumatriptan if symptoms persist.\n\n【36】Episodic cluster headache is much less common, but it is more easily diagnosed by its distinctive pattern of periodic attacks of intense, unilateral, periorbital pain with nasal or ocular watering lasting only minutes to hours but recurring daily over several weeks or months. Acute attacks can be treated with oxygen or subcutaneous sumatriptan.\n\n【37】####",

        "text": "【0】Question: A visibly upset 15-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department because he punched a wall and now has pain in his hand. The physician tells the patient that he has broken his hand. Which of the following is the most likely site of this patient’s fracture?\n\n【1】> (A) Distal radius\n\n【2】> (B) Hamate\n\n【3】> (C) Metacarpals\n\n【4】> (D) Phalanges\n\n【5】> (E) Scaphoid\n\n【6】 Answer: The correct answer is C . This patient most likely has a “boxer’s fracture,” which occurs when individuals strike a blow with a closed fist against a hard, unyielding object. The most commonly injured sites for experienced boxers are the first and second metacarpals, whereas for others, the neck of the fifth metacarpal is the most common site of injury. The metacarpals have a good blood supply and thus heal rapidly.  \nAnswer A is incorrect . A complete transverse fracture of the distal radius is called Colles’ fracture. This occurs most commonly in the elderly after forced dorsiflexion. It results in avulsion of the styloid process from the shaft of the radius. The radius may be shortened, and the styloid process of the ulna may project farther distally than the styloid process of the radius. The forearm and hand may exhibit a “dinner fork” deformity as a result of the posterior displacement of the distal part of the radius.  \nAnswer B is incorrect . Fracture of the hamate is not common but can be complicated, as the ulnar nerve can often be injured. Patients with an ulnar nerve lesion at the wrist may have an ulnar claw hand, which is caused by a weakness of the medial two lumbricals that flex at the metacarpophalangeal joints and extend at the interphalangeal joints of the ring and little fingers. Patients will also experience weakness in the ability to abduct or adduct fingers or adduct the thumb at the metacarpophalangeal joints (interosseous muscles and adductor pollicis). They are unable to hold a piece of paper between the thumb and index finger or between adjacent fingers. Weakness of the interosseous muscles may also result in a slight clawing of the index and middle fingers. The muscles in the hypothenar eminence may also be affected; patients experience weakness in flexion, abduction, and opposition of the fifth finger. Altered sensation in skin of the medial aspect of the hand and medial digits may be evident. There are healing difficulties associated with this type of fracture.  \nAnswer D is incorrect . Fracture of the phalanges is a common injury and is often due to crushing or hyperextension injuries.  \nAnswer E is incorrect . Fracture of the scaphoid commonly occurs when individuals fall onto an outstretched hand. The scaphoid is the most commonly fractured carpal bone, and patients may exhibit pain and tenderness localized over the anatomic snuffbox.",

        "text": "【0】Question: An infant boy experiences multiple bacterial, viral, and fungal infections during his first year of life. He has also been suffering diarrhea since birth. Tests are performed to determine the likely cause of his symptoms. Serum calcium levels are normal, and the patient’s white blood cells change nitroblue tetrazolium from clear to bright blue; however, his B- and T-lymphocyte counts are very low. What is a possible mechanism accounting for his symptoms?\n\n【1】> (A) Defective interleukin-2 receptors\n\n【2】> (B) Failure of the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches to descend\n\n【3】> (C) Inability of helper T lymphocytes to switch classes\n\n【4】> (D) Lack of NADPH oxidase activity\n\n【5】> (E) X-linked tyrosine kinase defect\n\n【6】 Answer: The correct answer is A. Severe combined immunodeficiency can be caused by multiple factors: failure to synthesize major histocompatibility complex II antigens, defective interleukin-2 receptors, or adenosine deaminase deficiency. This defect in early stem cell differentiation results in a lack of T and B lymphocytes. Without T and B lymphocytes, patients are at significantly increased risk of bacterial, viral, and fungal infections. Treatment includes bone marrow transplantation.  \nAnswer B is incorrect. Failure of the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches to descend is known as DiGeorge syndrome, and results in no thymus or parathyroid glands. Chromosome 22q 11 deletions are associated with DiGeorge syndrome. Tetany from hypocalcemia and viral and fungal infections are common due to the lack of T lymphocytes, while normal B lymphocytes are present.  \nAnswer C is incorrect. A CD40 ligand defect causes hyper-IgM syndrome, because the CD4 T-helper cells are unable to switch classes from IgM. Although these patients present with multiple infections such as pneumonia, sinusitis, infectious diarrhea, and central nervous system (CNS) infections, the most common laboratory finding is neutropenia, not low levels of lymphocytes.  \nAnswer D is incorrect. The lack of reduced NADPH oxidase activity results in chronic granulomatous disease. Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli , and Aspergillus are common pathogens. The nitroblue tetrazolium dye reduction test shows no activity in these patients. Because the question stem says that the nitroblue tetrazolium dye test turned blue, this patient must have normal NADPH oxidase activity, and thus cannot have chronic granulomatous disease.  \nAnswer E is incorrect. An X-linked tyrosine kinase defect causes Bruton agammaglobulinemia, resulting in decreased levels of all immunoglobulin molecules. Infections begin to occur after the maternal IgG antibodies decline, typically after six months of life.",

He otherwise had a clean bill of health and denied any psychological stress or emotional issues. Upon further questioning, he admitted to regular, heavy use of cocaine for the past 2 years. After he had started experimenting with cocaine, he started to notice these symptoms, which were tolerable at the time. However, the sensations progressively worsened to the point where he could no longer resist the urge to scratch or to pick at his skin. His general practitioner could not determine the cause, and as a result, referred him to your psychodermatology clinic for help.\n\n【12】You gently suggested that the temporal association between his period of cocaine use and the appearance of his symptoms might explain the etiology of his condition. However, Mr. Northwood insisted that there were “bugs” involved, and brought up the fact that a few of his fellow cocaine users were noting similar symptoms suggestive of infestation. After a long discussion, you convinced him that a referral to a drug rehabilitation program was needed. As for the formication symptoms, you discussed possibly taking pimozide at the next visit, after he had had a normal electrocardiogram (EKG) test. A few weeks later, you were notified that Mr. Northwood never showed up to his initial visit at the rehab facility. Thereafter, all attempts to reach the patient were not successful.\n\n【13】Reflections on the Case\n-----------------------\n\n【14】Formication has been associated with the use of certain recreational drugs, such as cocaine, amphetamine, and narcotics. Patients who are dependent on alcohol tend to experience visual DoP not during periods of alcohol use but during periods of alcohol withdrawal. Of note, a number of medical conditions can also cause the DoP-type clinical picture, including but not limited to B12 or folate deficiency, thyroid abnormality, etc.\n\n【15】“Cocaine bug” is a commonly used term among cocaine users who frequently experience formication from cocaine use. Fortunately, most of these cocaine users know that the formication is from cocaine and not from a real-life situation. In rare instances that are typically seen with chronic drug abuse, a small portion of cocaine users may develop full-blown delusional parasitosis and come to believe that they are truly infested 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 \\]</u>. This has been reported in a couple experiencing a shared delusion associated with cocaine use 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 \\]</u>. The case described above was chosen deliberately for Mr. Northwood’s imperfect insight because those with clear insight regarding the drug-induced nature of their symptoms are unlikely to seek help from a dermatologic practitioner.\n\n【16】It is important to be mindful about Mr. Northwood’s sensitivity surrounding his history of multi-recreational drug use. If you phrase your questions as blunt and forceful requests, he may become defensive and deny any drug use altogether. It may be wise to ask questions about his recreational drug use very nonchalantly – as if this is simply an effort on your part to obtain information about every patient’s medical history in a thorough fashion. He may find it comfortably acceptable if questions about his recreational drug use are conducted in a mechanical fashion, following routine questions about his general health (i.e. sleep, appetite, etc.) as well as any history of over-the-counter and prescription drug use.\n\n【17】In terms of management, the first and the foremost intervention is to get these patients to discontinue the current drug abuse. Without detoxification, there is no reliable solution to their condition. Moreover, chronic drug users commonly abuse multiple recreational substances, as illustrated by the case of Mr. Northwood, who admitted to using narcotics in addition to cocaine. This renders the use of pimozide risky even for symptomatic relief, since pimozide is known to have opiate blocking effects and can precipitate withdrawal reactions depending on the degree to which the patient is addicted to the narcotics.\n\n【18】It is an unfortunate fact that drug abusers, similar to alcoholics, are typically resistant to accepting help. Nevertheless, referrals to detoxification programs should still be made with much enthusiasm and encouragement on your part. Even though these patients may not follow up with your referrals within a reasonable time frame, with enough accumulated difficulty in life, they will eventually commit to receiving professional help. A useful analogy that the author (JK) frequently employs is that of a stonecutter, who may strike a large stone many times at first with no visible effects. After numerous strikes, the stone suddenly splits open. This is to say that the practitioner should not feel discouraged about the initial resistance from the recalcitrant drug-abusing patient.",

        "text": "【0】CASE 10: INTRAVENOUS FLUID RESUSCITATION\n\n【1】History\n\n【2】A 48-year-old male was the driver in a head-on collision between two cars travelling at 45 miles  删除换行1 per hour. He has an open tibial fracture and a distended and bruised abdomen. During the primary survey in the Emergency Department, it is noted that he is hypotensive and tachycardic.\n\n【3】A decision is made to initiate fluid resuscitation.\n\n【4】Questions\n\n【5】1. What is the content of 0.9% saline and Hartmann’s solution?\n\n【6】2. How is water distributed in the body?\n\n【7】3. How is 1 L of crystalloid fluid distributed in the body? How is 1 L of 5% dextrose  删除换行1 solution distributed in the body? How is 1 L of blood distributed in the body?\n\n【8】DISCUSSION\n\n【9】Intravenous fluids can be divided into crystalloids and colloids. Crystalloids are made up of  删除换行1 water-soluble molecules (e.g. saline solution, Hartmann’s solution). Colloid fluids contain  删除换行1 insoluble molecules (e.g. Gelofusin, which contains gelatin).\n\n【10】Saline solution (0.9% sodium chloride) contains both sodium (154 mmol/L) and chloride  删除换行1 (154 mmol/L). Hartmann’s solution contains the following: sodium 131 mmol/L, chloride 111  删除换行1 mmol/L, potassium 5 mmol/L, calcium 2 mmol/L and bicarbonate 29 mmol/L (which is supplied in the form of lactate, which is then metabolised to bicarbonate).\n\n【11】Sixty percent percent of the human body mass is composed of water, of which two-thirds lies  删除换行1 in the intracellular compartment and one-third lies in the extracellular compartment. The  删除换行1 extracellular compartment is further subdivided into interstitial fluid (75%) and intravascular fluid (25%). Thus, a 70 kg human will have 42 L of total body water (60% of mass), of which  删除换行1 28 L (two-thirds) is intracellular and 14 L (one-third) is extracellular. Of the extracellular  删除换行1 water, 10.5 L (75%) is interstitial and 3.5 L (25%) is intravascular fluid.\n\n【12】To calculate what volume of 1 L of crystalloid such as saline 0.9% or Hartmann’s solution enters the intravascular space, the above principles apply. The sodium content of both  删除换行1 of these fluids is similar to plasma, which means the entire 1 L of fluid will be distributed amongst the extracellular compartment. Thus, 750 mL (75%) will be interstitial, and  删除换行1 250 mL (25%) will be intravascular. Five percent of dextrose or glucose solutions are distributed relative to total body water, so that 666.6 mL is intracellular and 333.3 mL is extracellular. Of the extracellular fluid, 250 mL is interstitial and 83.3 mL is intravascular. Of note,  删除换行1 when administering a blood transfusion, all of the content is distributed in the intravascular  删除换行1 space, making it ideal for hypotensive resuscitation.\nThe disadvantage of using colloids such as Gelofusin is that they contain insoluble proteins that can cause bleeding disorders, interfere with blood cross-matching and may lead  删除换行1 to anaphylaxis. Although colloids provide more initial intravascular expansion, it is now  删除换行1 accepted that there is no significant difference in reducing mortality when using crystalloids  删除换行1 or colloids for fluid resuscitation. This was demonstrated in the Saline versus Albumin Fluid  删除换行5 Evaluation (SAFE) Study 通用删除7(英):<u>(2004)</u>, which showed that albumin (colloid) and saline (crystalloid) 删除换行1 should be considered clinically equivalent treatments for intravascular volume resuscitation  删除换行1 in a heterogeneous population of patients in the Intensive Care Unit. Further studies on fluid  删除换行1 resuscitation of patients with traumatic brain injury have shown that colloids are associated  删除换行1 with a higher mortality than crystalloids.\n\n【13】Key Points\n\n【14】• When resuscitating a hypotensive patient, using 1 L of crystalloid will equate to 250  删除换行1 mL of intravascular fluid; using 1 L of dextrose 5% will equate to less than 100 mL \n\n【15】of intravascular fluid; and using 1 L of blood will equate to 1 L of intravascular fluid.\n\n【16】• Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) guidelines and the SAFE study recommend  删除换行1 crystalloid instead of colloid fluid resuscitation. Crystalloids are cheaper and do  删除换行1 not exhibit the same disadvantages (blood clotting disorders and anaphylaxis) as  删除换行1 colloids.",

Affected males die in utero. The disorder is caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene， which encodes for a methyl-binding protein. This protein is most abundant in the brain and is thought to act as a gene suppressor during development.\n\n【6】What is the progression of this condition over time?\n\n【7】The course of this disorder is divided into stages：\n\n【8】SStage 1 (6-18 months)： Subtle delays in gross motor skills， less eye contact， and reduced interest in play. SStage 2 (1-4 years)： Rapid loss of purposeful hand movements and loss of speech. Patients begin to display characteristic hand movements (wringing， tapping， clapping). Breathing abnormalities are common with periods of apnea and hyperventilation.\n\n【9】SStage 3 (2-10 years)： Ataxia， motor problems， and seizures.\n\n【10】SStage 4： The final stage， marked by reduced mobility， curvature of the spine (scoliosis)， and muscle rigidity.\n\n【11】What is the treatment and prognosis for patients with this condition?\n\n【12】Treatment for Rett disorder is aimed at alleviating symptoms with careful management of nutrition， pharmacotherapy for seizures， speech therapy for language dysfunction， and physical therapy for motor dysfunction. Patients can generally live for decades with successful management of symptoms.",

        "text": "【0】Question: An 18-month-old child is brought to the physician by her distraught parents because of a sore throat, difficulty breathing, and a barking cough for the past day. On physical examination, the toddler is found to have some respiratory stridor and a runny nose but is not in acute distress. The rest of the examination is unremarkable. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient?\n\n【1】> (A) Amantadine\n\n【2】> (B) Bronchoalveolar lavage\n\n【3】> (C) Emergency department admittance\n\n【4】> (D) Penicillin\n\n【5】> (E) Supportive therapy\n\n【6】 Answer: The correct answer is E. The most likely diagnosis is croup, which is most commonly caused by parainfluenza virus. Croup is an infection of the upper airway causing narrowing that leads to inspiratory wheezing and a barking cough. Most cases of croup require only supportive therapy as treatment. Severe cases may require supplemental oxygen, corticosteroids, and epinephrine. While parainfluenza is the most common agent responsible for croup, it can also be caused by influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and measles.  \nAnswer A is incorrect. Amantadine is an antiviral that has a narrow spectrum and is used to treat influenza type A. While influenza can cause croup, it is not the most common cause of this disease.  \nAnswer B is incorrect. Bronchoalveolar lavage is used to sample the lower respiratory tract in severe pneumonia, in the diagnosis of a lung tumor, and in the assessment of fibrosing alveolitis, among other indications.  \nAnswer C is incorrect. Admission to the emergency department may be called for if the child is in acute respiratory distress.  \nAnswer D is incorrect. Penicillin can be used to treat streptococcal pharyngitis, which presents with red, swollen tonsils and pharynx and a high fever.",

A chest X-ray demonstrates multifocal pneumonia and she is started on broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin and piperacillin–tazobactam. During her hospitalization, she develops a bullous eruption on the trunk and dermatology is consulted. On examination, there are many tense vesicles and bullae on an erythematous base filled with serous fluid, some arranged in an arcuate pattern ( 76a ).\n\n【4】i. Based on this patient’s history and clinical presentation, what is the diagnosis and what test should be used to confirm your suspicion?\n\n【5】ii. What is the treatment for this condition?\n\n【6】Answer 76\n\n【7】i. The patient has linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD), an immune-mediated bullous disorder characterized by subepidermal blisters and linear deposition of IgA along the basement membrane zone seen on direct immunofluorescence ( 76b ). To confirm the diagnosis, a skin biopsy should be completed and sent for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain as well as direct immunofluorescence. In adults, LABD is commonly drug induced. One of the most common culprit medications is vancomycin. Other drugs that have been identified in association with LABD are penicillins, cephalosporins, captopril and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). LABD can also be idiopathic or seen in association with other disease processes including gastrointestinal disorders such as gluten-sensitive enteropathy and ulcerative colitis, infections and malignancies. There is a childhood form, known as chronic bullous disease of childhood, which is identical histologically to LABD but has a unique clinical presentation and has been associated with Crohn’s disease but not medications or malignancy.\n\n【8】Clinically, LABD presents as subepidermal bullae arranged in a herpetiform or annular pattern. There are often clusters of smaller vesicles that are described as a ‘crown of jewels’ and new blisters tend to arise in a ring around older lesions, known as the ‘string of beads’ sign. In adults, the bullae often first present on the extremities and over time can progress to other sites. In children, the bullae classically involve the genital region initially but can spread to involve the face, lower trunk, hands and feet. Mucous membrane involvement is observed in up to 50% of patients.\n\n【9】ii. In patients with drug-induced LABD, the first step is to remove the offending agent. Most patients with LABD will respond further to oral dapsone therapy within 2–3 days. It is important to check the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) level and adjust the dose accordingly. Sulfapyridine has also been used in place of dapsone. Oral prednisone up to 40 mg daily can also be used as an adjunctive treatment for disease control. Children usually respond to dapsone at a dose of 1–2 mg/kg daily.",

        "text": "【0】Case 8\n\n【1】You are called to manage the airway of a 22-year-old male boxer who is admitted to the ICU for inspiratory stridor after suffering from head and neck trauma during a professional boxing match earlier that evening. He is suffering from rhabdomy-olysis and a concussion. He is confused about the timeline of events that night. A CT scan of his brain reveals mild cerebral edema and no evidence ofintracranial bleeding. He is responsive to deep voice stimuli. He is 72 in tall and 80 kg in weight.\n\n【2】What is the most important initial step in the management of this patient?\n\n【3】What are other management considerations?\n\n【4】ANSWERS TO CASE 8：Airway Management/Respiratory Failure\n\n【5】Summary： This 22-year-old boxer has inspiratory stridor， which indicates impending respiratory failure due to upper airway obstruction or collapse.\n\n【6】Most important initial management： 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Rapid-sequence intubation (RSI) to protect the airway； 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> avoid the use of a nasal gastric tube (NGT) since this patient has facial trauma， and there is risk of perforation of the cribriform plate by the NGT. Insertion via the mouth is the preferred option.\n\n【7】Other steps： Chest x-ray to evaluate the trachea and correct placement of the endotracheal tube (ETT) as well as pneumothorax. If cerebral edema is present， high minute ventilation should be used to produce a respiratory alkalosis to decrease intracranial pressure (ICP). Positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) should not be excessive to avoid increasing ICP. Propofol is indicated for induc-tion and sedation since it lowers ICP， has anti-seizure activity， and has a rapid elimination profile allowing for accurate assessment of the CNS status.\n\n【8】Objectives\n\n【9】1\\. To understand the indications and contraindications for endotracheal in-tubation (ETI).\n\n【10】2\\. To understand alternative methods for airway control.\n\n【11】3. To understand the most common complications of endotracheal intubation.\n\n【12】4.To understand the required steps and tools for endotracheal intubation.\n\n【13】Considerations\n\n【14】This 22-year-old boxer presents with head and neck trauma and shows inspiratory stridor， which portends possible airway collapse. This requires RSI for the protec-tion and control of the airway. A“wait and see\"attitude in this patient would likely lead to devastating consequences. A nasogastric tube may be required to reduce the likelihood of aspiration of blood. Aspiration precautions were begun with elevation of the head of the bed to 45 degrees upright. Mechanical ventila-tion is begun on assist control (AC) mode of 22 breaths/minute with a tidal volume of 500 mL with a 100% Fio。 and a PEEP of 5. A higher minute ventilation is prudent to decrease intracerebral pressure.\n\n【15】APPROACH TO：Airway Management/Ventilator Support\n\n【16】INTUBATION IN CRITICAL CARE SETTINGS\n\n【17】The most common indication for endotracheal intubation (ETI) is to treat hypoxic respiratory failure and hypercarbic ventilatory failure. The initial treatment for hypoxia begins with the insertion of a low-flow nasal cannula and the delivery of about 3% per liter of Flo， then escalating to 100% with the use of a non-rebreather mask or high-flow O， therapy. Patients with impaired consciousness and an inability to protect their airway have secondary indications for ETl. One should assure that the patient does not have any documentation where endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation have been refused or where a do-not-intubate (DNI) or do not resuscitate (DNR) order exists. The patient’s wishes or those of the family or the legal guardian should be considered prior to further invasive measures. Other sec-ondary indications for ETI include the significant aspiration of particulate matter.\n\n【18】ETl may be indicated for patients requiring bronchoscopy and pulmonary lavage， those with neurological or traumatic injuries who need deep sedation and intuba-tion to perform necessary imaging tests or diagnostic and therapeutic procedures， and for individuals with status epileptics who require deep sedation or paralysis for treatment of seizures.\n\n【19】Endotracheal Intubation\n\n【20】Endotracheal intubation (ETI) is the definitive method for control of the airway， and a common procedure for patients undergoing general anesthesia. The laryngeal mask airway (LMA)， device that does not require a tube through the trachea or a laryngoscope for placement， and is an alternative for patients scheduled for shorter surgeries. The LMA is a short ETT-type tube that is surrounded and held in place by a laryngeal mask. The apex of the mask， with its open end pointing downward toward the tongue， is pushed backward toward the wvula. The LMA is effective as a short-term option and does not require as much expertise for placement as ETI. Those patients who may need airway control range from those scheduled to receive anesthesia to critically ill patients with multi-system disease or injuries. Emergency situations such as cardiac or respiratory arrest also require the need for ETI. It is effective in situations to protect the airway from aspiration， address inadequate oxygenation or ventilation， and for patients with existing or anticipated airway obstruction. These indications are increasingly more complicated in an era of advanced technology in oxygen delivery systems and noninvasive forms of ven-tilation. These forms can be divided in 3 basic categories： 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> hypoxic respiratory failure (decreased Po，)， 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> hypercarbic ventilator failure (including cardiac arrest)， drug overdose (elevated Pco，)， and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> impaired level of consciousness， requiring airway protection to prevent aspiration.\n\n【21】The excessive presence and inability of the patient to clear secretions are more important indicators for airway protection and ETI than is absence of the gag reflex. The lack of a gag reflex is not a sensitive predictor for ETI for airway control.\n\n【22】Checking of the gag reflex should be performed with suctioning equipment is at hand， since it may induce vomiting and cause aspiration. The accumulation of large amounts of secretions in the oral cavity， without ability to clear， is an indication for ETI. If the patient can speak， is cooperative， and responds to verbal questioning， then one should consider a trial of NIV (noninvasive ventilation)， provided it does not delay an eventual ETI. The assisted ventilation provided from NIV therapy can provide additional time for the treatment of underlying medical conditions with steroids， bronchodilators， diuretics， nitrates， or other medications.\n\n【23】Hypoxic Respiratory Failure\n\n【24】Hypoxic respiratory failure or Type 1 hypoxic respiratory failure is defined as hypox-emia without hypercarbia. An impairment of oxygen exchange via the pulmonary alveolar capillary membrane (>A-a gradient) results in hypoxemia， leading to a diminished delivery of oxygen to the cells and tissues. A quick and easy way to cal-culate the A-a gradient is shown later. You should not have a negative A-a gradient as determined by the equation：\n\n【25】The initial treatment of all causes of hypoxemia includes： (a) ensure a patent airway， (b) provide adequate ventilation， and (c) provide supplemental oxygen. A PAO， value of 60 mm Hg or an arterial oxygen saturation of 90% to 92% is often suggested as a minimal accepted value. Patients with hypoxemia will improve upon delivery of increasingly higher Fio， indicating VQ mismatch as the underlying pathophysiologic cause. If the hypoxemia is resistant to high Fio， concentration， the most likely cause is shunting (eg， ARDS).\n\n【26】The treatment of hypoxia begins by ensuring a patent airway for adequate ven-tilation and oxygenation of the patient. Trials of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) may be indicated， but this should not delay intubation and MV if needed. If the O， saturation fails to improve on 100% Fio。 then ETI and MV should be undertaken so PEEP can be administered.\n\n【27】Hypercarbic Ventilatory Failure (Paco，)\n\n【28】Hypercarbic ventilatory failure occurs when there is an inability to remove carbon dioxide (CO，) from the alveoli. This condition may be the result of a primary lung disorder or secondarily associated with cardiac， neurologic， or metabolic causes.\n\n【29】The symptoms and signs of hypercarbia are explained by the fact that increas-ing PACO， results in vasoconstriction， confusion， sedation， and acidosis. Diagnosis of hypercarbia is confirmed with an ABG with a PACO， >45 mm Hg and significant acidemia secondary to the elevated PAco，. The rate of change in PACO， will affect the signs and symptoms. If the change in Paco， is gradual， then the onset of symp-toms such as lethargy， headache， and confusion will be more gradual. However， if the PACO， rapidly changes， then the onset of symptoms will be more pronounced. Treat-ment of hypercarbic ventilator failure includes supplemental oxygenation and ensuring that the patient has a patent airway. The treatment should be specifically directed toward the underlying etiology. If the patient's condition does not improve with the initial treatment， then increasing the minute ventilation is necessary.\n\n【30】Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation should be attempted first unless there is an obvious need for an ETI. The indications for progressing to ETI are ventila-tory failure despite CPAP， signs of impending respiratory failure such as increasing dyspnea， tachypnea， the use of accessory breathing muscles， and low tidal volume ventilation.\n\n【31】Impaired Consciousness and Airway Protection\n\n【32】Patients with Glasgow coma scale (GCS) values of 8 or less should be intubated because of diminished levels of consciousness， continued hypoventilation， and a need for airway protection. Comatose patients have decreased respiratory drive， hypoventilation， airway obstruction and the decreased ability to clear secretions. Thirty percent of the patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage and traumatic brain injury are likely to develop pulmonary edema， severe acute adult lung injury， or ARDS. When there is concern of increased ICP and uncal herniation， hyperven-tilation with alkalosis has been shown to be helpful by inducing cerebral vasocon-striction. Propofol for sedation has also been shown to reduce intracranial pressure. Prolonged hyperventilation for prophylaxis of ICP should be avoided because of the risk for ischemic brain injury. Other indications for ETI include traumatic injury or swelling to the face or neck， or other obstructive airway processes.\n\n【33】Contraindications to Endotracheal Intubation\n\n【34】Because of the urgency for ventilatory support or airway control， relatively few contraindications exist for ETI. Direct laryngoscopy is contraindicated in patients with partial transection of the trachea because this can cause a complete loss of the airway. In this situation， one should consider establishing a surgical airway. If the cervical spine is unstable to bending as in RA， then strict， inline stabilization of the cervical spine is needed and must be maintained during ETI to avoid cord injury and paralysis. Of note， video-assisted ETT placement has reduced the need to hyperex-tend the neck during intubation.\n\n【35】Special Considerations\n\n【36】Before intubation， all the necessary equipment must be at hand. The recommended equipment includes： gloves， protective face shield， suction system， bag-valve mask ABTT1attached to an oxygen source， ETT with a stylet， 10 mL syringe， ETT holder， end-tidal carbon dioxide detector， stethoscope， and laryngoscope with blade or new fiberoptic technology. The fiberoptic laryngoscope allows visual guidance of the blade and observing the insertion of the ETT past the vocal cords. The two common types of blades currently in use are the Miller straight blade and the curved MacIn-tosh blade. ETTs are available in different internal diameters： 7.0， 7.5， and 8 mm. In adults， the 8-mm diameter tube should be used when possible. The tracheal size is best estimated by the patient's predicted BMI and not actual BMI. The ETT are available cuffed and uncuffed varieties. The uncuffed tubes are usually for children whereas the cuffed tubes are for older children and adults. Cuffs should not be over-inflated， since they are designed as large-volume， low-pressure systems to prevent mucosal ischemia of the trachea. Pre-oxygenation， with 100% oxygen by a non-rebreather mask or a bag-valve mask is necessary to increase oxygenation 删除换行1 in the blood； this is achieved by replacing the higher proportion of N， in the room air with oxygen. This is accomplished by using 100% O。 which also increases the patient's functional reserve capacity with oxygen and increases the interval before the next desaturation. Increasing the amount of oxygenation reduces the amount of positive-pressure ventilation， which reduces the risk of aspiration of gastric contents.\n\n【37】Before any procedure is initiated， one should confirm that consent forms have been signed， unless it is an emergency. If it is an emergency， one should ensure that there is no order for do-not-resuscitate (DNR) or a do-not-intubate (DNI). The stylet， is normally flexible and can be reshaped， is usually placed into the ETT to maintain the natural curvature of the airway. IV access should be established and the patient's vital signs should be continuously monitored. Proper positioning the patient before intubation is important. The patient's head should be level with the lower portion of the sternum. The “sniffing”position can be accomplished by plac-ing a pillow or folded towel beneath the patient's occiput. Alignment of the 3 axis of the oral cavity pharynx， and larynx， which is ideal for vocal cord visualization， can be arranged by flexing the neck and extending the head. Any dentures should be removed. An assistant should perform the Sellick maneuver (applying firm pres-sure to the cricoid cartilage)， which compresses the esophagus between the cricoid cartilage and the cervical vertebrae avoiding aspiration of the gastric content. This maneuver reduces the risk of passive aspiration of gastric contents and improves visualization of the glottis.\n\n【38】Neuromuscular blocking agents and strong sedatives are used to improve visualiza-tion of the vocal cords and to reduce the likelihood of vomiting and aspiration. Midazolam and fenyanyl are the hypnotic agents typically used for induction. Other combinations include thiopental and ketamine. A commonly used neuromuscular blocking agent is succinylcholine. Rocuronium is a substitute when there is a con-traindication for succinylcholine especially in the presence of hyperkalemia. Suc cinylcholine should be avoided in hyperkalemia because of the depolarization at the neuromuscular junction. Edema， obstruction， tumors， trauma， and infections can all increase the difficulty of intubation. Other situations that can make intuba-tion more difficult are small mandible， limited neck mobility， and edematous tongue(angioedema， amyloidosis). Neuromuscular blockers used to paralyze the patient for MV are associated with neurological deficits and sequelae and should be avoided.\n\n【39】Confirmation\nAfter the placement， the ETT should be in the mid trachea， with the ETT tip 3 to4 cm above the carina. Bilateral breath sounds and equal expansion of the lungs should be noted. An end-tidal carbon dioxide detector (capnography) needs to be connected to the ETT， and this monitor should change color within the first6 breaths. Lack of color change suggests that the ETT is not in the trachea. The ETT should be repositioned until the CO， monitor confirms correct endotracheal placement by changing colors. A chest x-ray is needed to verify ETT placement and ensure that the ETT is not in the right or left main stem bronchus. After successful 删除换行5 ETI， the tube should be secured via an ETT holder or adhesive tape. If facial hair interferes with securing the ETT， simply shave the patient.\n\n【40】Major complications of ETT placement include： bronchospasm， hypoxemia， hypercapnia， and death. Vom1i1tti1rng， bradycardia， laryngospasm， pneumonitis， and pneumonia are also seen. Some authorities recommend IV lidocaine prior to ETI to reduce ETI-induced bronchospasm. ETI and MV also are associated with increased cases of ICU delirium.\n\n【41】SUMMARY\n\n【42】The main goal of ETI and MV is to provide a patent airway for the delivery of oxy-gen and proper ventilation that are primary to a patient’s survival. This also allows suctioning of secretions， application of PEEP， and delivery of aerosolized medica tions. The decision to proceed with this invasive ETI requires an understanding of the pathologic and physiologic disorders that necessitate its use. A qualitative colorimetric EtCO， monitor is commonly used to determine placement and is nearly100% sensitive and specific for ETT placement in the trachea.\n删除16：<u>CLINICAL CASE CORRELATION\n\n【43】· See also Case 3 (Scoring Systems and Patient Prognosis)， Case 9 (Ventilator Management)， Case 11 (Asthmatic Management)， and Case 12 (Non-invasive Methods of Ventilatory Support).\n</u>",

        "text": "【0】Question: An 87-year-old man suffered an acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction a few minutes ago. He was subsequently treated with aspirin, metoprolol, and heparin. Immediately before being taken to the catheterization laboratory, the patient becomes unresponsive. He is placed on telemetry and his rhythm strip is shown in the image. Although the patient receives a series of emergent defibrillations, he does not convert to sinus rhythm. Due to failure to respond, the patient is given an agent associated with which of the following potential adverse effects?\n删除个例：<u>> Reproduced, with permission, from USMLERx.com.</u>\n> (A) Bleeding\n\n【1】> (B) Increased post-myocardial infarction mortality\n\n【2】> (C) Malar rash\n\n【3】> (D) Pulmonary fibrosis\n\n【4】> (E) Yellow-green vision\n\n【5】 Answer: The correct answer is D . Ventricular fibrillation is an irregular ventricular rhythm without any distinct QRS complexes, ST segments, or T waves. This is an important cause of sudden cardiac death, as well as mortality within the first 24 hours of an acute MI. If defibrillation fails to convert to sinus rhythm, the next treatment choice is the use of antiarrhythmics. There are four general classes of antiarrhythmics: class I blocks sodium channels, class II blocks β-adrenergic receptors, class III blocks potassium channels, and class IV blocks calcium channels. Epinephrine, amiodarone (class IA and class III properties), or lidocaine (class IB) are the agents indicated after a round of unsuccessful defibrillation. Of these agents, only amiodarone may produce the adverse effect of pulmonary fibrosis. Amiodarone is also associated with hypotension, thyroid dysfunction (both hypo- and hyperthyroidism), hepatotoxicity, ocular changes, and other arrhythmias (namely, bradyarrhythmias and torsades de pointes). In patients taking amiodarone, remember to check pulmonary function tests, liver function tests, and thyroid function tests.  \nAnswer A is incorrect . There is no increased risk of bleeding associated with any of the antiarrhythmic drugs. Warfarin and heparin are commonly used drugs that can cause bleeding. However, they would not be used during ventricular fibrillation.  \nAnswer B is incorrect . Class IC agents (ie, flecainide and encainide) are contraindicated in the post-MI population, due to their association with increased post-MI mortality. These drugs work at phase 3 of the action potential and have no effect on action potential duration. They are most often used in cases of ventricular tachycardia that progress to ventricular fibrillation, or intractable supraventricular tachycardia.  \nAnswer C is incorrect . Procainamide, a type 1A antiarrhythmic drug, is a common cause of drug-induced lupus, but it is not used to treat a patient in ventricular fibrillation. It acts by increasing action potential duration and increasing QT interval. It is most often used for treatment of re-entrant and ectopic supraventricular and ventricular tachycardia. Other drugs in this class include quinidine (which has the adverse effect of cinchonism), amiodarone (which is also a class III antiarrhythmic), and disopyramide.  \nAnswer E is incorrect . Digoxin toxicity can lead to disturbances in color vision, including yellow-green vision, as well as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and arrhythmias. Digoxin directly inhibits Na <sup class=\"calibre40\">+ </sup> /K <sup class=\"calibre40\">+ </sup> \\-ATPase, leading to indirect inhibition of the Na <sup class=\"calibre40\">+ </sup> /Ca <sup class=\"calibre40\">2+ </sup> exchanger. Therefore there is an increase in intracellular calcium, leading to positive inotropy. This drug is most often used for chronic heart failure and control of atrial fibrillation, not for ventricular fibrillation.",

Positive antibody-antigen interaction results in RBC agglutination. Five experiments are conducted for each sample, as shown in the image.

Because the donor’s RBCs do not agglutinate with anti-A or anti-B antibodies, the donor blood type must be O. The fact that donor sera agglutinates both A cells and B cells confirms this, because type O serum contains both anti-A and anti-B antibodies. By similar reasoning, the recipient must be blood type A. Anti-D agglutination implies that RBCs in a sample have the Rh antigen. Thus the donor is Rh negative, and the recipient is Rh positive. Hence the correct pair is an O-negative donor and A-positive recipient. Donor and recipient blood should always be cross-matched, because pre-formed antibodies in the recipient can lyse donor RBCs and vice versa. This immunologic response can culminate in an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction with sequelae of shock, pyrexia, and both chest and flank pain.  \nAnswer A is incorrect . Anti-A antibodies do not agglutinate donor RBCs. Thus the donor cannot be type A.  \nAnswer B is incorrect . Anti-A and anti-B antibodies do not agglutinate donor RBCs. Thus the donor cannot be type AB.  \nAnswer C is incorrect . Anti-A and anti-B antibodies do not agglutinate donor RBCs. Thus the donor cannot be blood type AB. No agglutination implies that the antigen is not present on the sample RBCs (hence this donor is type O). Both A and B RBCs are agglutinated in the donor serum, as expected, because anti-A and anti-B antibodies are generated in patients with blood type O.  \nAnswer D is incorrect . Anti-B antibodies do not agglutinate donor RBCs. Thus the donor cannot be type B .  \nAnswer F is incorrect . Donor RBCs do not agglutinate with either anti-A or anti-B antibody. Thus the donor blood type must be O. Because anti-D agglutination is negative, the donor must be Rh negative. The donor blood type is therefore O negative, not O positive.",

Duringg1isovolumetriccventricular contraction.ventricular myocytes are depolarized and contract forcefully. Pressure within the ventricle is rising so that it is greater than atrial pressure but less than aortic pressure. Thus， both the AV and the aortic valves are closed. The first， not the second， heart sound is heard as the AV valve closes. Because blood is still flowing out of the aorta during this time， aortic pressure is falling.\n\n【18】\\[11.2\\] D. An increase in ventricular muscle cell length along its length-tension curve results in a more optimal interaction of cross-bridges with actin， thus producing more force than is produced at the shorter length. There is little if any effect on calcium fluxes or on conduction among muscle cells.\n\n【19】\\[11.3\\] C. Inhibition of calcium influx during the action potential also reduces the amount of calcium released from the sarcoplasmic retic-ulum， resulting in less calcium bound to troponin-C and a reduction in the force of contraction. These changes occur independently of ventricular end-diastolic lengths so that force developed at all lengths will be less than it was before drug administration. Because the change in force is length-independent (a change in contractility)， the overlap of thick and thin filaments plays no role.\n\n【20】PHYSIOLOGY PEARLS\n\n【21】Calcium influx during excitation is a major determinant of the force of contraction in cardiac muscle but not in skeletal muscle.\n\n【22】During the rapid ventricular ejection phase， aortic pressure is rising， but during the reduced ventricular ejection phase， aortic pressure begins to fall.\n\n【23】The majority of filling of the ventricle with blood occurs during ven-tricular diastole before atrial contraction.\n\n【24】Ventricular muscle normally begins contracting when it is at lengths less than the optimal length for force development (on the ascending slope of the length-force relationship).",

        "text": "【0】Subchapter 3.1\n\n【1】Bite of the Brown Recluse Spider: An Introduction to Protein Gel Electrophoresis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>\n======================================================================================\n\n【2】Introduction\n------------\n\n【3】Proteins are involved in every aspect of cellular life. Proteins function to transport materials across membranes, catalyze chemical reactions, organize DNA, support the movement of materials within a cell, and even drive movement of the entire cell. The technique of sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or SDS-PAGE is a standard technique for the analysis of the protein composition of a sample. The nature of the sample will vary depending on the specific experiment.\n\n【4】Proteins differ in the number and type of amino acids that assemble to form a polypeptide chain. The chemistry of the amino acid side chains (R groups) determines protein folding and the overall charge of the protein. SDS-PAGE works by separating proteins based on their relative size. In order to do this, protein folding and the differences in charge of the various proteins must be eliminated. Protein gel samples are treated with the nonionic detergent, sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ). SDS coats the proteins with a net negative charge, masking any charges normally present on the protein’s surface. The sample is also treated to disrupt protein folding by the addition of chemical reagents such as dithiothreitol ( DTT ) or beta mercaptoethanol ( BME ) and heat. DTT and BME function to disrupt any disulfide bonds within the protein. The combination of SDS, DTT/BME, and heat will denature or unfold the protein.\n\n【5】The protein sample is loaded into a well or space that is formed at the top of the polyacrylamide gel. Polyacrylamide is chemically crosslinked to form a Jello-like matrix or gel. The density of the gel can be varied based on the percent composition of polyacrylamide. High percent acrylamide (dense) gels are useful for examining small proteins while lower percent acrylamide (thin) gels are best for examining larger proteins. Gels with an acrylamide concentration of around 8–10% are standard for most research applications.\n\n【6】The power of SDS-PAGE comes from its ability to separate a mixture of proteins into individual bands . Proteins migrate out from the well and through the polyacrylamide matrix in response to an electrical current. Recall that all the proteins in a sample have been treated with SDS and so are now negatively charged. Negatively charged proteins will migrate away from a anode and toward an cathode in an electrical circuit. The speed with which the various proteins migrate will be influenced by the degree of crosslinking of the acrylamide gel. Smaller proteins will have an easier time moving through the crosslinked matrix while larger proteins will move much more slowly. The net effect is the separation of proteins based on size, with smaller proteins at the bottom of a gel and larger proteins nearer the top. The size of a protein can be estimated by comparing the distance a protein has migrated relative to the movement of molecular weight standards . These standards are a mix of proteins of known molecular weight (in units of kilodaltons or kDa ).\n\n【7】Protein gels must be stained to visualize the individual protein bands before they can be analyzed. Various staining protocols exist; however, one very common method is the use of a stain called Coomassie Blue . The Coomassie dye has the advantage of binding to proteins in a 1:1 ratio. This means that the staining intensity of a protein band on the gel is a measure of the concentration of that particular protein in the sample.\n\n【8】▪ Name the amino acids that would contribute a positive charge to the surface of a protein.\n\n【9】▪ Which amino acids are involved in the formation of a disulfide bond?\n\n【10】▪ Conduct a search for images of a polyacrylamide gel and the apparatus used to run the gel.\n\n【11】▪ Explain why a small protein migrates faster than a larger protein in a gel.\n\n【12】Background\n----------\n\n【13】Red blood cells (RBCs) are specialized to carry oxygen to all parts of an organism. RBCs are unusual as they lack most of the organelles you would expect to find in a typical eukaryotic cell. These “cells” are really nothing more than a plasma membrane surrounding a cytoplasm full of the oxygen-binding protein, hemoglobin. Breaking open the RBCs (lysis) releases hemoglobin and leaves behind a pure preparation of RBC plasma membranes or RBC ghosts .\n\n【14】Because these cells must be able to move through small capillaries, their plasma membrane is reinforced by a special collection of peripheral membrane proteins. The proteins α/β spectrin, ankryin , actin , and protein 4.1 bind to one another, forming a cage-like scaffold or membrane cytoskeleton on the cytoplasmic surface of the RBC plasma membrane. The membrane cytoskeleton is anchored to the plasma membrane through its attachment to the many Band 3 anion transporter proteins that exist as transmembrane proteins in the RBC plasma membrane.\n\n【15】Spiders belonging to the genus Loxoceles are commonly known as brown recluse spiders. Despite their reputation, there are few fatalities linked to brown recluse spider bites ( envenomation ); however, their venom can cause serious health problems. The cutaneous form of the bite is localized to the skin and appears as a painful sore that can be followed by necrosis or the loss of tissue. If the venom is carried into the bloodstream, it can cause RBCs to lyse, resulting in the viscerocutanous or systemic form of the bite, which causes anemia, jaundice, and fever. Spider venom is a mixture of many proteins, some of which function as proteases . A protease is a type of enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of proteins based on its ability to recognize specific short amino acid sequences. This case study illustrates how the technique of SDS-PAGE was used to examine the effect of spider venom on blood cells.\n\n【16】▪ Name the cellular components typically associated with eukaryotic cells.\n\n【17】▪ Describe the difference between an integral and peripheral membrane protein.\n\n【18】▪ Research/review the structure of the RBC membrane cytoskeleton. Note the interactions between the various protein components.\n\n【19】▪ Anemia results when the number of available RBCs is too low. Predict some likely symptoms that would be associated with anemia.\n\n【20】▪ Suggest a reason why RBCs lacking hemoglobin are called “ghosts.”\n\n【21】▪ Proteases catalyze the reverse reaction that occurs during translation. Explain how this reaction would cause a protein to fall apart.\n\n【22】Methods\n-------\n\n【23】### Red blood cell ghosts\n\n【24】Blood samples were collected from four patients who had previously presented with the viscerocutaneous form of Loxoceles envenomation, four patients who had presented the cutaneous form of Loxoceles envenomation, and four individuals who had not been envenomated. RBCs were washed three times with saline at 4°C and lysed using 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 8.3) at 4°C. Membrane ghosts were washed by repeated centrifugation at 25,000 g until a colorless solution of ghosts was obtained.

He reported that his foot was extremely painful  删除换行1 and he was taken to hospital.\n\n【3】Examination\n\n【4】The builder says that he has pain in his hind foot only. On inspection he has a closed  删除换行1 injury with significant midfoot swelling. He has no neurovascular deficit. He had palpable  删除换行1 tenderness just proximal to his midfoot. Radiographs are shown in Figs 19.1 and 19.2.\n\n【5】删除3：<u>Figure 19.1 Figure 19.2 </u>\n\n【6】Questions\n\n【7】• What is the diagnosis?\n\n【8】• What other injuries are associated with this injury?\n\n【9】• Describe the blood supply to the talus.\n\n【10】• What are possible complications of this injury?\n\n【11】ANSWER 19\n\n【12】The diagnosis is a talus fracture. The lateral X-ray shows a displaced fracture through the  删除换行1 talar neck. The classification of talar neck fractures was described by Hawkins in 1970.\n\n【13】• With type I injuries, the talar neck fracture remains undisplaced.\n\n【14】• With type II injuries, the talar neck fracture is displaced and the subtalar joint is subluxated or dislocated. (In the present case the talar neck is fractured but the subtalar  删除换行1 joint is not dislocated.)\n\n【15】• With type III injuries, the talar neck fracture is displaced and the body of the talus is  删除换行1 dislocated from both the subtalar and ankle joints. The body is usually extruded posteromedially to rest between the Achilles tendon and the posterior surface of the tibia.\n\n【16】• With type IV injuries, a displaced talar neck fracture is associated with dislocation of  删除换行1 the talar body from both the subtalar and ankle joints, and dislocation of the talar  删除换行1 head from the talonavicular joint.\n\n【17】Hawkins’s sign is the appearance of a zone of osteopenia or lucency under the subchondral bone of the talar dome.\n\n【18】Associated injuries are common, and frequently include the medial malleous and lumbar  删除换行1 spine fractures.\n\n【19】The middle portion of the talar body receives its blood supply from the tarsal canal artery,  删除换行1 which consistently arises 2 cm below the ankle from the posterior tibial artery. About  删除换行1 5 mm from its origin the tarsal canal artery gives off a deltoid branch, which supplies the  删除换行1 medial quarter of the talar body. The dorsalis pedis and peroneal arteries have branches  删除换行1 which anastomose to form the tarsal sinus artery. The tarsal sinus artery provides blood  删除换行1 to the lateral aspect of the talar body and the majority of the talar head.\nWith type I fractures the intraosseous vessels coursing from distal to proximal in the talar  删除换行1 neck are disrupted, so the avascular necrosis (AVN) rate of the talar body ranges from 0 to  删除换行1 10 per cent. With type II fractures, the intraosseous blood supply and the vessels coursing  删除换行1 inferiorly from the tarsal sinus artery are damaged (likely in the present case). The AVN  删除换行5 rate is 20–50 per cent. With type III fractures, the AVN rate ranges from 50 to 100 per  删除换行1 cent, as the intraosseous, tarsal sinus, tarsal canal and deltoid vessels are all injured. With  删除换行1 type IV fractures, the risk of AVN of the talar body approaches 100 per cent and damage  删除换行1 to the blood supply to the talar head occurs as well.\n\n【20】KEY POINTS\n\n【21】• Talus fractures occur with forced dorsiflexion injury.\n\n【22】• The talus has a tenuous blood supply.\n\n【23】• Associated injuries are common, and frequently include the medial malleolus and  删除换行1 lumbar spine fractures.\n\n【24】• Risk of avascular necrosis depends on the degree of displacement and ranges from 10  删除换行1 to 100 per cent.\n\n【25】• Hawkins’s sign is the appearance of a zone of osteopenia or lucency under the  删除换行1 subchondral bone of the talar dome.删除个例：<u>Orthopaedics</u>",

        "text": "【0】Case Files™ Neurology, Second Edition    \n\n【1】### CASE 26\n\n【2】A 28-year-old man presents to the emergency center with a 48-hour complaint of headache and nausea. The headache is primarily in the frontal and occipital regions and associated with mild nausea. He has taken various over-the-counter analgesics without any improvement in the headache. The intensity of the headache has gradually increased since it began prompting evaluation as he was no longer able to tolerate it. His only other symptom besides nausea is tightness in the shoulders and neck. He is not known to have any medical illnesses, and there is no history of head trauma. On examination, he has a temperature of 32.8°C (100.8°F); blood pressure, 110/68 mmHg; and pulse, of 100 beats/min. He is awake and alert and fully oriented. His Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) is normal; however, he feels he is taking too much time to answer the questions. His general examination is notable for the finding of a Kernig sign without evidence of any skin rash. A Brudzinski sign is not present. Cranial nerves are normal except for bilateral horizontal nystagmus. His motor, sensory, and cerebellar examinations are normal. The deep tendon reflexes are hyperreflexic throughout without evidence of a Babinski sign. A CT scan of the head is performed without contrast, which is read as normal. Importantly his headache is worse now than what it was when he presented to the emergency room.\n\n【3】 What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【4】 What is the best next diagnostic step?\n\n【5】 What is the next step in therapy?\n\n【6】### ANSWERS TO CASE 26: Viral Meningitis\n\n【7】Summary : A 28-year-old man without medical illnesses presents with a 48-hour history of crescendo headache. Associated symptoms include nausea and slowness in responding to questions. The examination is notable for a Kernig sign, horizontal nystagmus, and generalized hyperreflexia.\n\n【8】• Most likely diagnosis : Viral meningitis\n\n【9】• Best diagnostic step : Lumbar puncture\n\n【10】• Next step in therapy : Start IV antibiotics and IV acyclovir\n\n【11】#### ANALYSIS\n\n【12】##### Objectives\n\n【13】1\\. Know the clinical presentation of meningitis.\n\n【14】2\\. Learn to develop a diagnostic strategy for the diagnosis of meningitis and understand the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings in bacterial and viral meningitis.\n\n【15】3\\. Know the treatment strategy for meningitis in the emergency room.\n\n【16】##### Considerations\n\n【17】The presentation of a crescendo headache associated with nausea, fever, and slowness in responding to questions should alert the clinician of meningitis or encephalitis. The presence of neck tightness and a Kernig sign is consistent with meningitis. The lumbar puncture CSF study is the best way to determine the etiology of meningitis in order to distinguish between a bacterial versus viral etiology. Although CSF studies are critical to identifying the cause of the meningitis, an imaging study with either a brain CT or MRI scan is preferably done prior to the spinal tap. Although the MRI brain scan offers better resolution than a CT head scan, it may not always be readily available. The study of choice between the latter is based on what can be done the quickest. The importance of the imaging studies is to help exclude increased intracranial pressure caused by impaired CSF drainage or a space-occupying lesion. Focal neurologic findings or the presence of papilledema mandate on an imaging study . Once it is determined that the risk of herniation is low, a lumbar puncture is performed. Lumbar puncture analysis should include opening and closing pressure, and CSF studies for glucose, protein, cell count with differential, Gram stain, culture, latex particle agglutination, herpes simplex virus (HSV) polymerase chain reaction (PCR), enteroviral (EV) reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR, Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL), and extra CSF retained for additional studies. Other tests to consider include chemistry 20, complete blood count (CBC) with differential and platelets, international normalized ratio (INR)/prothrombin time (PT)/partial thromboplastin time (PTT), HIV, blood cultures. However, if there is a delay in obtaining an imaging study, blood cultures should be taken from the patient, and empiric IV antibiotics should be started immediately. The initial choice of antibiotics is customarily a third-generation cephalosporin such as ceftriaxone or cefotaxime plus vancomycin, IV dexamethasone, IV acyclovir. These should be given after blood and CSF are collected, or even when there is a delay in obtaining a lumbar puncture.\n\n【18】### APPROACH TO: Suspected Meningitis\n\n【19】#### DEFINITIONS\n\n【20】MENINGITIS : Inflammation of the membranes of the brain and spinal cord (meninges) caused by many different organisms.\n\n【21】KERNIG SIGN : The inability to completely extend the leg when the hip is flexed in the supine position. This is caused by severe stiffness in the hamstring muscles from inflammation of the lumbosacral roots.\n\n【22】BRUDZINSKI SIGN : Flexion of the neck causes involuntary flexion of the thighs and the legs.\n\n【23】LATEX PARTICLE AGGLUTINATION : A test where an antibody or antigen coats the surface of latex particles (sensitized latex). When a sample containing the specific antigen or antibody is mixed with the milky appearing sensitized latex, visible agglutination is noted. It is used to detect Haemophilus influenzae type b, Streptococcus pneumoniae , and Neisseria meningitidis A, B, and C soluble antigens.\n\n【24】HSV PCR : Polymerase chain reaction is a molecular technique that allows a small amount of DNA to be replicated and amplified. In this case, HSV DNA is detected. HSV PCR for CSF has an estimated sensitivity of 95% and specificity of almost 100%.\n\n【25】EV RT-PCR : Enteroviral reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction is a technique in which cDNA is made from RNA via reverse transcription. The cDNA is then replicated and amplified through standard PCR protocols. In this particular case, various viruses belonging to the enterovirus family can be detected.\n\n【26】NYSTAGMUS : A rapid involuntary oscillatory movement of the eyes.\n\n【27】#### CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【28】##### Etiology\n\n【29】The most common causes of viral meningitis in the United States are viruses from the enterovirus family. Approximately 75,000 cases of enterovirus meningitis occur in the United States each year. Coxsackie A9, B3–5, and echovirus 4, 6, 7, 8, 11, 18, and 30 are the most common strains. The infection is spread by fecal–oral route; although, spread through the respiratory route is noted rarely. Outbreaks can be associated with pharyngitis or gastroenteritis and occur in the late summer and early fall. There can be a viral exanthem present. Other viral causes of meningitis include HSV, arboviruses (St. Louis encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, Western equine encephalitis virus, Eastern equine encephalitis, and La Crosse virus), Arenaviruses, and retroviruses. The arboviruses are viruses that are transmitted to humans via arthropods, most commonly mosquitoes or ticks.\n\n【30】In contrast, bacterial meningitis is typically more severe and carries a higher morbidity and mortality rate when compared to viral meningitis. The incidence of bacterial meningitis is approximately 3 to 5 per 100,000 people per year in the United States. Annually, 2000 deaths have been reported in the United States from bacterial meningitis. The relative frequency of bacterial species as a cause of meningitis varies with age. During the neonatal period, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes , and group B streptococci account for most of the causes of neonatal meningitis. Following the neonatal period, H influenza, S pneumoniae , and N meningitidis account for 80% of cases. In 1987, widespread vaccination against H influenza type B led to a marked reduction in this pathogen causing meningitis in children. Streptococcal pneumonia and Neisseria meningitis are now the principal causes of meningitis after the neonatal period.\n\n【31】##### Clinical Presentation and Evaluation\n\n【32】Typical symptoms of meningitis include the classic triad of headache, fever, and neck stiffness . Other symptoms include photophobia (eye pain or sensitivity to light), nausea, vomiting, myalgia confusion, declining levels of consciousness (from lethargy to coma), seizures, and focal neurologic deficits such as cranial nerve palsies, hemiparesis, or dysphasia, because of ischemic strokes caused by secondary thrombosis or inflammation of cerebral vessels.\n\n【33】In evaluating patients with meningitis, it is critical to differentiate between a bacterial and viral or other type of meningitis. Certain findings on clinical examination can point toward a bacterial infection rather than a viral infection. For example, the presence of a very high fever or widespread macular papular rash or the presence of purpura or ecchymosis suggests a bacterial infection such as Neisseria meningitis. CSF studies, however, are more definitive and will allow the differentiation between viral and bacterial meningitis. CSF studies in viral meningitis may reveal an elevated opening pressure, normal glucose, elevated CSF cell counts from 200 to >1000 white blood cells/µL with no more than 50% polymorphonuclear cells. However, within the first 24 hours of infection, up to 90% of white blood cells can be polymorphonuclear cells. Viral CSF cultures have a relatively low sensitivity and poor ability to grow. Furthermore, the clinical utility of this is limited by the amount of time requiring the enterovirus to grow (days to weeks). The EV RT-PCR on CSF has 100% specificity and 95% sensitivity. Results are often available within 4 hours.\n\n【34】CSF studies in bacterial meningitis reveal an elevated opening pressure (greater than 200 mm of H <sub class=\"calibre12\">2 </sub> O), elevated protein 100 mg/dL to 500 mg/dL (normal 15 mg/dL to 45 mg/dL), reduced glucose (less than 40% serum glucose), and pleocytosis (100 to 10,000 white blood cells/µL; normal <5) with 60% or greater polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Sixty percent of bacterial meningitis cases will have a positive Gram stain result with approximately 75% having a positive CSF culture. Blood cultures will pick up the causative organism of bacterial meningitis in 50% of cases emphasizing the fact that bacteremia is present early on and explains why bacterial meningitis is a true medical emergency. Antibiotics administered up to 2 hours before a lumbar puncture do not decrease the sensitivity of CSF culture done in conjunction with latex particle agglutination and blood cultures. Antibiotics administered for longer than 2 hours before a lumbar puncture may decrease the findings of a positive Gram stain or positive culture in the CSF by 5% to 40%.\n\n【35】In most cases of viral meningitis, the neuroimaging studies are normal, however, a key exception is HSV meningitis in which there can be evidence of hemorrhage in the temporal lobe region Neuroimaging studies in bacterial meningitis are often normal but can also reveal complications such as infarction, venous sinus thrombosis, communicating or noncommunicating hydrocephalus, and increased intracranial pressure.\n\n【36】##### Treatment\n\n【37】The key in reducing morbidity and mortality in patients with meningitis is rapid recognition so that treatment can be implemented. This means identifying the causative agent as soon as possible. Many of the indicated diagnostic tests take several hours before results are available making it impossible to wait for the results before treatment is instituted. As a result, treatment with antibiotics and/or retrovirals is started while waiting for test results 删除33：<u></u>. Penicillin G or ampicillin and a third-generation cephalosporin are typical first-line agents for the treatment of bacterial meningitis. However, the drug resistance has started to become a frequent problem, and as a result, treatment recommendations are changing based on local resistance patterns. Ampicillin covers most pneumococcus, meningococcus, and Listeria. Ceftriaxone or cefotaxime, third-generation cephalosporins, cover gram-negative organisms as well as ampicillin-resistant H influenza . Vancomycin is added to third-generation cephalosporins to cover Staphylococcus aureus when patients have undergone recent neurosurgical procedures or head trauma or if the sensitivity for S pneumoniae is unknown. Aminoglycosides are added to treat gram-positive bacilli and gram-negative bacilli.\n\n【38】删除3：<u>Figure 26–1 . Sample algorithm for the evaluation and management of possible meningitis.</u>\n\n【39】Adjuvant therapy with intravenous corticosteroids for bacterial meningitis is clearly indicated in children to reduce complications such as deafness, mental retardation, or epilepsy. In adults, the use of intravenous corticosteroids is not as clear. There is some evidence to suggest that penetration of vancomycin into CSF is reduced by the administration of corticosteroids. Additionally, corticosteroids can mask clinical signs for antibody response. However, recent studies have shown the benefit in preventing systemic complications as well as neurologic deficits in adult patients with S pneumoniae meningitis when corticosteroids are given.\n\n【40】As of yet, there is no effective treatment for viral meningitis except if HSV is suspected. The treatment for HSV meningitis is intravenous acyclovir. HSV meningitis infrequently presents in patients at the time of their first episode of genital herpes. Approximately, 11% of men and 36% of women with genital herpes will exhibit symptoms consistent with HSV meningitis. Immunocompromised patients may be at more risk for HSV meningitis as well. In adults, the prognosis for recovery is excellent, although some patients will have residual headache. Sensorineural hearing loss can occur especially in children. Infants and neonates can have more serious long-term sequelae such as cognitive deficits or learning disabilities. In contrast, herpes encephalitis is the most common cause of sporadic viral encephalitis, with the predilection for the temporal lobes. The clinical presentation can range from aseptic meningitis and fever to severe rapidly progressive forms with significant mortality of the latter.\n\n【41】####",

If this is maintained, the muscle will  删除换行1 not get scope to be shortened and torticollis may not appear.\n\n【21】(ii) When the condition is noticed only after the  删除换行1 torticollis has developed —\n\n【22】(a) A brace or harness may be used to correct the  删除换行1 torticollis. Daily physiotherapy should be given to stretch  删除换行1 the affected sternomastoid muscle. But this may not be  删除换行1 successful to correct the deformity.\n\n【23】(b) So operation is the only treatment of choice in  删除换行1 this condition. The best technique is to divide the  删除换行1 sternomastoid muscle at its distal or proximal attachment  删除换行1 by open method. In majority of cases both the heads (sternal  删除换行1 and clavicular) at the lower end are divided by open method.\nSubcutaneous tenotomy is a blind technique and should be  删除换行1 avoided in children lest it injures the major blood vessels  删除换行1 deep to the sternomastoid muscle. During division one must  删除换行1 be careful not to injure the spinal accessory nerve or to injure  删除换行1 any blood vessel. Any soft tissue contracture (e.g. deep fascia  删除换行1 etc.) or neighbouring muscle contracture (e.g. scalenus  删除换行1 anterior etc.) should be divided.\n\n【24】Postoperative care.— After operation the neck is kept in  删除换行1 over-corrected position for about 6 months with torticollis  删除换行1 harness. After 6 months physiotherapy should be continued  删除换行1 for both active and passive movements of the neck.\n\n【25】CAROTID BODY TUMOUR (POTATO 删除换行3 TUMOUR; CHEMODECTOMA; NONCHROMAFFIN PARAGANGLIOMA)\n\n【26】What is carotid body ?\n\n【27】Ans : Carotid body is a chemoreceptor organ situated  删除换行1 near the bifurcation of the common carotid artery on each  删除换行1 side. In the carotid body there are receptors which are  删除换行1 stimulated by the rise in the PC02 删除换行1  or H+ concentration of  删除换行1 arterial blood or a decline in its POr\n\n【28】 Hyperventilation is  删除换行1 produced by increase in arterial PC02 删除换行1 . So these are respiratory  删除换行1 chemoreceptors and chemical control of respiration is  删除换行1 adjusted by these chemoreceptors. Carotid body consists of  删除换行1 a number of separate lobules around which there is no true  删除换行1 capsule. Within each lobule there are solid nests of large  删除换行1 pale-staining epitheloid cells or chief cells which are supported  删除换行1 by a connective tissue frame work in which there is spongelike arrangement of capillary sinusoids in addition to  删除换行1 myelinated nerve fibres and ganglion cells. The chief cells  删除换行1 have finely granular eosinophilic cytoplasm and small uniform  删除换行1 nuclei. The carotid body and the aortic body are the chief  删除换行1 chemoreceptors present in the human body. The carotid body  删除换行1 is supplied by the glossopharyngeal nerve whereas the aortic 删除换行1 body is supplied by the vagus nerve. The chief cells are the  删除换行1 chemoreceptor cells. There are also sustentacular cells 删除换行1 surrounded by sinusoidal vessels. The sustentacular cells  删除换行1 appear to be interposed between the blood and the  删除换行1 chemoreceptor cells. The myelinated nerve fibres loose their  删除换行1 myelin sheath and become non-myelinated nerve fibres  删除换行1 which remain in contact with the cell membranes of the  删除换行1 chemoreceptor cells but do not penetrate into these cells.\nEach carotid or aortic body is also called glomus. The staining  删除换行1 reactions of glomus tissue suggest that both acetylcholine  删除换行1 and catecholamines are present. The blood flow to each  删除换行1 carotid body is enormous and much more than the blood  删除换行1 flow to the brain and kidney. Carotid body is part of the  删除换行1 non-chromaffin paragangliomas. So carotid body forms a part  删除换行1 of the chemoreceptor system as well as non-chromaffin  删除换行1 paraganglioma.\n\n【29】What are the other sites of chemoreceptors present in the body ?\n\n【30】Ans : (i) The carotid body and (ii) the aortic body are the  删除换行1 two principal chemoreceptors. Besides these there are (iii) 删除换行1 chemoreceptors in the brain stem located near the respiratory  删除换行1 centre itself on the ventral surface of the brain stem. There  删除换行1 are also (iv) pulmonary and (v) myocardial chemoreceptors  删除换行1 in the pulmonary and coronary vessels respectively.\n\n【31】What are the other sites of non-chromaffin paragangliomas 删除换行1 present in the body ?\n\n【32】删除3：<u>Fig.8.14 .— The various locations of non-chromaffin  删除换行1 paragangliomas are demonstrated in this figure.</u>\n\n【33】Ans : (i) The carotid body at the medial aspect of the  删除换行1 common carotid artery at the point of bifurcation, (ii) The 删除换行1 aortic body near the arch of the aorta at the points of origin of  删除换行1 the left coronary artery and the innominate artery, (iii) The 删除换行1 glomus jugulare, which is located in the adventitia of the  删除换行1 jugular bulb, (iv) The glomus intravagale, which is associated  删除换行1 with ganglion nodosum of the vagus nerve, (v) The  删除换行1 paraganglion tympanicum, which is distributed along the  删除换行1 tympanic branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve.\n\n【34】Besides these, tumours of chemoreceptor tissue have been  删除换行1 found (vi) in the femoral canal in relation to the femoral  删除换行1 artery, (vii) in the small bowel mesentery and (viii) in the  删除换行1 retroperitoneum.\n\n【35】DEEP OR PLUNGING RANULA\n\n【36】The tumour is well capsulated. It looks yellow or orange on  删除换行1 cut surface. This is a firm homogeneous and compact tumour,  删除换行1 almost looks like a potato. So it is called the ‘potato tumour’. It  删除换行1 is so intimately adherent to the carotid artery that it is often  删除换行1 impossible to excise the tumour without sacrificing part of the  删除换行1 common, internal or external carotid artery.\n\n【37】Histologically, this tumour is composed of characteristic  删除换行1 cell nests and alveolar arrangements of chief cells. It almost  删除换行1 shows the same histologic pattern of a normal carotid body.\nOccasionally this tumour may demonstrate a moderately  删除换行1 severe degree of nuclear pleomorphism. This tumour is 删除换行1 considered to be a benign tumour and remains localised for  删除换行1 years. But regional metastasis occurs in about 20% of cases.\nBiologically aggressiveness which gives rise to local or distant  删除换行1 metastasis is seen in less than 5% of cases.\n\n【38】STERNOMASTOID TUMOUR\n\n【39】1. Age.— Highest incidence is seen between the ages of  删除换行1 40 and 60 years of life.\n\n【40】2. Sex.— This tumour occurs with equal frequency in  删除换行1 men and women.\n\n【41】3. Though majority are unilateral, occasionally bilateral  删除换行1 tumours may be seen. Tumours arising in other nonchromaffin paraganglioma may be noticed.\n\n【42】4. A strong familial incidence has been recorded.\n\n【43】5. The main symptom is slow growing painless swelling at  删除换行1 the bifurcation of the common carotid artery. Since the  删除换行1 swelling is painless, it attains the size of at least a plum before  删除换行1 the patient comes to a clinician. It increases in size very slowly.\n\n【44】6. Usually there is a long history.\n\n【45】7. If the lesion lies deep to the bifurcation of the carotid  删除换行1 artery, compression of the oesophagus or larynx is the first  删除换行1 complaint.\n\n【46】8. Horner's syndrome may be present.' Similarly there  删除换行1 may be unilateral paralysis of the vocal cord.\n\n【47】9. Patient may suffer from symptoms of transient cerebral  删除换行1 ischaemia, e.g. blackouts, transient paraesthesia or paralysis.\nBut these are rare since compression of the carotid artery by 删除换行1 the tumour is very slow. Pressure on the tumour may give  删除换行1 rise to syncopal attack.\n\n【48】Examinations.—\n\n【49】(i) Position.— This tumour is situated at the bifurcation  删除换行1 of the common carotid artery and therefore is seen in the  删除换行1 upper part of the anterior triangle of the neck at the level of  删除换行1 the upper border of the thyroid cartilage or just below the  删除换行1 level of the hyoid bone, under cover of the anterior edge of  删除换行1 the sternomastoid muscle. The tumour is beneath the  删除换行1 anterior edge of the sternomastoid muscle and deep to the  删除换行1 deep cervical fascia.\n\n【50】(ii) Tenderness and temperature.— This tumour is not  删除换行1 tender or hot and the overlying skin looks normal.\n\n【51】(iii) Size.— Carotid body tumour varies in size from 2  删除换行1 cm to 10 cm in diameter.\n\n【52】(iv) Shape.— Carotid body tumour is initially a round  删除换行1 shaped swelling, but as it grows bigger, it becomes irregular  删除换行1 in shape, with narrower lower end which is caught between  删除换行1 the bifurcation of the common carotid artery.\n\n【53】(v) Surface.— The surface is usually smooth, but it may  删除换行1 be slightly bosselated.\n\n【54】(vi) Edge.— The edge is usually distinct.\n\n【55】(vii) Consistency.— The majority of these tumours are  删除换行1 solid and hard. This is called potato tumour.\n\n【56】(viii) Pulsation.— This tumour sometimes, not always,  删除换行1 pulsates. This may be a transmitted pulsation as the tumour  删除换行1 lies on the carotid artery. Sometimes the external carotid  删除换行1 artery runs over the superficial aspect of the tumour and  删除换行1 this causes a pulsating tumour (expansile pulsation).\n\n【57】Occasionally this tumour may be so vascular that it pulsates  删除换行1 (expansile pulsation).\n\n【58】(ix) Mobility.— This tumour cannot be moved vertically,  删除换行1 though it can be moved sideways.\n\n【59】(x) Lymph nodes.— The regional lymph nodes are  删除换行1 usually not enlarged.\n\n【60】Differential Diagnosis.—\n\n【61】1. Cervical lymph node enlargement, whatever may be  删除换行1 the pathology.\n\n【62】2. Sternomastoid tumour.\n\n【63】3. Branchial cyst.\n\n【64】4. Aneurysm of the carotid artery.\n\n【65】5. Thyroid gland enlargement.\n\n【66】6. Aberrant lateral thyroid.\n\n【67】Special Investigations.—\n\n【68】1. Arteriography will definitely diagnose the condition and  删除换行1 it will show splayed carotid fork due to presence of tumour  删除换行1 at the bifurcation. It may show the abnormal tumour vessels  删除换行1 within the tumour.\n\n【69】2. Open biopsy is definitely confirmatory, but is dangerous  删除换行1 as it may injure the carotid artery.\n\n【70】Treatment.—\n\n【71】Surgical excision is the only treatment available in this  删除换行1 condition.\n\n【72】(i) In case of old individuals with a long history the  删除换行1 tumour may be left as it is without any interference.\n\n【73】(ii) Otherwise in all cases the tumour should be explored  删除换行1 by an adequate incision. If the tumour can be dissected easily  删除换行1 from the carotid artery, it should be removed.\n\n【74】(iii) When the tumour is large and inseparable from the  删除换行1 carotid artery, the tumour should be resected alongwith the  删除换行1 bifurcation of the carotid artery. In such cases it is essential  删除换行1 to maintain the blood supply to the brain by a temporary  删除换行1 by-pass system. After excision of the tumour alongwith the  删除换行1 bifurcation of the carotid artery, continuity of the arteries is  删除换行1 restored by dacron graft or autogenous vein graft.\n\n【75】(iv) This tumour is radio-resistant.\n\n【76】(v) General surgeons if come across carotid body tumour  删除换行1 where adequate facilities are not available they may simply  删除换行1 take biopsy and handover the case to the vascular surgeons.\n\n【77】CLINICAL FEATURES.—\nIt is an enlargement of the subhyoid bursa with  删除换行1 accumulation of inflammatory fluid within it. So it may be  删除换行1 called subhyoid bursitis. The subhyoid bursa is situated below  删除换行1 the hyoid bone and in front of the thyrohyoid membrane.\n\n【78】Diagnosis.— (i) Pain with swelling just below the hyoid  删除换行1 bone in the midline is the characteristic feature of this  删除换行1 condition.\n\n【79】(ii) The swelling is oval with long axis placed  删除换行1 transversally parallel to the hyoid bone (cf. thyroglossal cyst).\n\n【80】(iii) As mentioned earlier it is also a midline swelling,  删除换行1 which moves up with deglutition as it is attached to the hyoid  删除换行1 bone. But it does not move with protrusion of the tongue.\n\n【81】(iv) It is a cystic swelling, so fluctuation test is positive.\nTransillumination test is negative as the fluid, it contains, is  删除换行1 turbid and not clear.\n\n【82】Treatment.—- Complete excision of the cyst by making a  删除换行1 transverse incision along the Langer's line over the cyst is  删除换行1 the only treatment.\n\n【83】THE SWELLINGS, WHICH MOVE UP\n\n【84】WITH DEGLUTITION, ARE:\n\n【85】1. Thyroid swellings.\n\n【86】2. Ectopic thyroid.\n\n【87】3. Thyroglossal cyst. '\n\n【88】4. Subhyoid bursal cyst or subhyoid bursitis.\n\n【89】5. Enlarged pretracheal lymph nodes which are fixed  删除换行1 to the trachea.\n\n【90】6. Laryngocele.\n\n【91】Only thyroglossal cyst moves up also with protrusion of the 删除换行1 tongue.",
