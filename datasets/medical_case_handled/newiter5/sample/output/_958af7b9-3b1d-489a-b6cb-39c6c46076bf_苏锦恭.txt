【0】CASE 45: AN ITCHY RASH

【1】History

【2】Diamond is a 3-year-old boy who presents to his general practitioner (GP) with an itchy rash  删除换行1 that he has had for 4 days. He is otherwise well. He had bronchiolitis at the age of 4 months  删除换行1 but has had no other diseases. He is not on any medication. His 5-year-old brother has eczema  删除换行1 and his father has hay fever. He attends nursery three times a week. The family lives in a onebedroom flat, which is damp. His father smokes 20 cigarettes a day.

【3】Examination

【4】He is systemically well and apyrexial. He is very itchy, cannot stop scratching and has obvious linear scratch marks. He has papules, pustules with some associated crusting and a few  删除换行1 vesicles. The fingers, hands, flexor surfaces of the arms, axilla and feet seem to be the worst  删除换行1 affected areas but there are also lesions around the umbilicus and on the face.

【5】Questions

【6】• What is the most likely diagnosis?

【7】• What is the differential diagnosis of an itchy rash in a child?

【8】• What is the treatment?

【9】ANSWER 45

【10】The most likely diagnosis is scabies. This is caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei and is highly  删除换行1 contagious. Intense itching is typical. However in children under 1 year, this may present as  删除换行1 irritability. A history of contact may be present. The classic features are burrows, papules,  删除换行1 vesicles and pustules. Thread-like, linear burrows, typically in the finger webs and wrists,  删除换行1 are pathognomonic but are often difficult to see. Definitive diagnosis involves removal of  删除换行1 the mite from the burrow and examination under the microscope, but this, too, is difficult.
Secondary bacterial infection due to scratching is common. In infants, the rash usually  删除换行1 affects the palms, soles, axilla and scalp. In older children, lesions typically involve the web  删除换行1 space between the fingers, the flexor aspects of the wrist and arm, the axilla and the waistline.
The face is rarely involved in those over 5 years of age. Other areas of the body can also be  删除换行1 affected. Although there is a strong family history of atopy, Diamond has never had eczema  删除换行1 and it would be unusual for eczema to present for the first time at this age in this way.

【11】Common causes of an itchy rash in a child are as follows:

【12】• Eczema – very common, often involves face, elbow and knee flexures.

【13】• Seborrhoeic dermatitis – affects infants, often in association with cradle cap.

【14】• Scabies – itchy where mite has burrowed.

【15】• Insect bites – affects uncovered areas such as arms and legs.

【16】• Drug and contact allergies.

【17】• Urticaria – idiopathic or secondary to allergens, consists of wheal (raised and white) 删除换行1 and flare (red).

【18】• Fungal infections – e.g. tinea capitis or tinea pedis (athlete’s foot).

【19】• Chickenpox.

【20】Treatment consists of the application of scabicidal medication, e.g. permethrin. Family members and ‘kissing contacts’ should also be treated. Topical or oral antibiotics may also be  删除换行1 required to treat secondary bacterial infection. Oral antihistamines and topical steroids, e.g. 删除换行2 1 per cent hydrocortisone, may be needed to help treat the itching. All clothing, bed linen and  删除换行1 soft toys should be laundered to remove eggs and mites. It can take 4–6 weeks for the itching  删除换行1 to resolve. If lesions are still present at this time, persistent infection or reinfection should be  删除换行1 suspected and treatment may need repeating.

【21】Key Points

【22】• Scabies infestation causes severe itching.

【23】• The classic features are linear burrows, papules, vesicles and pustules.

【24】• The treatment of choice is permethrin.苏锦恭
