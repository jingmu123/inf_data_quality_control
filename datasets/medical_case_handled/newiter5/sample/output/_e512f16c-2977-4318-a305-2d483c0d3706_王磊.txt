【0】CASE 46: SHORTNESS OF BREATH AND PLEURITIC CHEST PAIN

【1】History

【2】A 55-year-old man is admitted to the accident and emergency department complaining  删除换行1 of gradual onset of shortness of breath over the course of several hours along with rightsided chest pain aggravated by deep inspiration. He is complaining of mild lightheadedness and feels the symptoms are getting worse. The pain is sharp and stabbing in nature.
He was previously fit and well. One day earlier he returned on a long haul flight from a  删除换行1 business trip to Asia. He denies any history of leg swelling.

【3】Examination

【4】Upon admission to hospital his oxygen saturation on air was 94 per cent and his respiratory rate was 20/minute. A chest radiograph failed to demonstrate any focal lesion.
Routine bloods were normal although D-dimer performed in the emergency department  删除换行1 was elevated. Electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated a mild sinus tachycardia heart rate  删除换行1 of only 102/minute. The accident and emergency team suspected a possible pulmonary  删除换行1 embolism (PE) and so a computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) was performed 删除33：<u></u>.

【7】Question

【8】• What do the CT images demonstrate?
 ANSWER 46

【9】删除3：<u>Figures 46.1 and 46.2 demonstrate axial and reformatted coronal CTPA images respectively, showing a large filling defect within the distal right main pulmonary artery  删除换行1 extending into the upper lobe artery.</u>
The initial chest radiograph in patients with pulmonary embolism is frequently normal.An initially normal chest radiograph may over time begin to show atelectasis, which  删除换行1 can progress to cause a small pleural effusion and an elevated hemidiaphragm. After  删除换行1 24–72 hours, one third of patients with proven PE develop focal infiltrates that are  删除换行1 indistinguishable from an infectious pneumonia. Occasionally, there may be evidence of  删除换行5 Westermark sign, which is focal oligaemia (absence of blood vessel markings) beyond  删除换行1 the location of the pulmonary embolism and dilatation of those vessels proximally. A  删除换行5 rare late finding of pulmonary infarction is the Hampton hump, a triangular or rounded  删除换行1 pleural-based infiltrate with the apex pointed toward the hilum, frequently located adjacent to the diaphragm.

【10】CTPA is the most common study used for detection of pulmonary embolism and has  删除换行1 become accepted both as the preferred primary diagnostic modality and as the standard  删除换行1 for making or excluding the diagnosis of PE. In the majority of patients, multi-detector 

【11】CT scans with intravenous contrast can resolve third-order pulmonary vessels.

【12】It is important to note, however, that multi-detector CTPA carries a radiation dose and  删除换行1 can miss lesions in a patient with pleuritic chest pain due to multiple small emboli that  删除换行1 have lodged in distal vessels. In patients with a normal chest radiograph, nuclear scintigraphic ventilation–perfusion (V/Q) scanning of the lung is an alternative diagnostic  删除换行1 modality for detecting PE with a lower radiation dose. This modality is recommended  删除换行1 only for patients with a normal chest radiograph in order to prevent spurious perfusion  删除换行1 mismatch from other lung processes.

【13】 KEY POINTS

【14】• The initial chest radiograph in patients with PE is frequently normal.

【15】• CTPA is the most common study used for detection of PE and has become accepted  删除换行1 both as the preferred primary diagnostic modality and as the standard for making or  删除换行1 excluding the diagnosis of PE.

【16】• It is important to note, however, that in patients with a normal chest radiograph,  删除换行1 ventilation–perfusion (V/Q) scanning is an alternative modality carrying a lower  删除换行1 radiation dose.王磊
