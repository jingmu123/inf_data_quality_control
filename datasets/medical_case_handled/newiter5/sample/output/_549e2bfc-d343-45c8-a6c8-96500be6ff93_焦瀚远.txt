【0】Question: 26.1 A 14-year-old girl has a 1-week history of arthritis involving her hands, wrists, knees, and ankles. At the onset she had noted that her cheeks seemed flushed; this resolved and has been followed by a slightly pruritic red macular rash over her torso and proximal extremities that is now clearing in some areas. On review of systems, she reports rhinorrhea and a low-grade fever 2 weeks ago. On examination, she has tender swelling of the aforementioned joints and an erythematous macular rash with a reticular pattern. Which of the following findings would help identify the most likely diagnosis?

【1】A. Positive rheumatoid factor

【2】B. Reticulocyte count of 0%

【3】C. Anemia

【4】D. Skin biopsy of the rash

【5】E. Synovial fluid analysis

【6】Answer: 26.1 B. The differential diagnosis for childhood arthritis includes infectious and rheumatologic disorders. Her symptoms and physical examination findings are typical of parvovirus B19 infection. Patients with this infection can have a transiently positive RF and often will have mild anemia. Parvovirus B19 targets erythroid precursors; there is no compensatory reticulocytosis as these are lysed by the virus. The other studies would not be helpful in distinguishing the etiology of the arthritis.

【7】Question: 26.2 A 5-year-old girl is referred to a pediatric rheumatologist with a 4-week history of mild swelling and decreased range of motion in the left knee and right elbow. She is afebrile and appears otherwise well. Positive findings on which of the following evaluations will be most helpful in establishing her diagnosis?

【8】A. Arthrocentesis

【9】B. Complete blood count

【10】C. Computerized tomographic scan of the involved joints

【11】D. Slit-lamp examination of her eyes

【12】E. Bone scan

【13】Answer: 26.2 D. JIA is the most common cause of uveitis in children. Uveitis onset may be insidious, and may be the only initial manifestation of JIA. The disease is more common in young girls. Slit-lamp findings include band keratopathy, posterior synechiae, and cataracts. Children with JIA should have periodic slit-lamp examinations in order to detect eye disease early. Consideration may be given to obtaining the tests suggested in the other answer choices, but positive results on these tests are unlikely to be specific for JIA.

【14】Question: 26.3 A 6-year-old boy presents with his mother after developing acute right groin and knee pain that causes him to limp. He and the mother do not recall any trauma. Review of systems is positive only for rhinorrhea and sore throat 2 weeks ago. On examination, he is afebrile and his knee exam is normal, but he walks with a right toe-touch gait. Which of the following are the most appropriate next steps in his evaluation?

【15】A. Assess range of motion of the right hip; measure WBC and ESR; perform ultrasound of the right hip.

【16】B. Perform ophthalmologic exam; measure ANA and RF; perform x-ray of the knee.

【17】C. Perform a full skin exam; interview the child alone about abuse; perform a skeletal survey.

【18】D. Ask the mother about bleeding disorders; measure coagulation factors; perform aspiration of the knee.

【19】E. Interview the child and mother about recent school stressors; provide reassurance to the mother that he is exaggerating growing pains for secondary gain; refer to counseling services.

【20】Answer: 26.3 A. A good rule of thumb is to examine one joint above and one joint below the site of symptoms. Hip pain may refer to the groin, anterior thigh, or knee. If the hip’s range of motion is near-normal, WBC and ESR are normal, and ultrasound shows a joint effusion, the most likely diagnosis is transient (toxic) synovitis of the hip.

【21】Question: 26.4 A 3-year-old boy with suspected systemic-onset JIA develops tachycardia and dyspnea on the fifth hospital day. He complains that his chest hurts. Heart auscultation reveals a “friction rub” sound. Which of the following is the next best step in management?

【22】A. Give him a nebulized albuterol treatment.

【23】B. Give him a dose of furosemide.

【24】C. Give him some acetaminophen.

【25】D. Check his oxygenation status through pulse oximetry, obtain a stat electrocardiogram, and consult with a pediatric cardiologist.

【26】E. Check his oxygenation status via pulse oximetry, obtain a stat chest x-ray, and initiate intravenous antibiotics.
Answer: 26.4 D. A friction rub is characteristic of pericarditis, which is a common and serious complication of systemic-onset JIA. The friction rub is a “grating” or “creaking” sound that often is best heard along the left sternal border. Patients typically complain of chest pain that is relieved when the patient is asked to lean forward, and worsened by deep inspiration or coughing; however, pain is not always present. Rarely, pericarditis in JIA may precede the development of arthritis by months or even years. Low-voltage QRS complexes and ST-segment elevation may be seen on the electrocardiogram. Treatment consists of salicylates or steroids.

【27】CLINICAL PEARLS

【28】 The spectrum of juvenile idiopathic arthritis comprises three entities: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> systemic-onset disease, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> polyarticular disease, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> oligoarticular disease.

【29】 Systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis is an important consideration in the differential diagnosis of childhood fever of unknown origin.

【30】 The diagnosis of juvenile idiopathic arthritis is based on clinical criteria and by the exclusion of other possibilities; no single laboratory test confirms the diagnosis.
