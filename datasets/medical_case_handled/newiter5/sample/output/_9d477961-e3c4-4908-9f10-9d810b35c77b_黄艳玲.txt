----------------------------------------

【1】A previously healthy one-year-old boy had an unremarkable past medical and family history.

【2】He presented on Day 5 of illness with fever for 5 days, along with nonsuppurative bilateral conjunctivitis for 3 days and congestive rashes for 2 days. He was treated with cefmenoxime and vidarabine monophosphate for 4 days in clinic, but the treatment was ineffective. He was admitted in pediatric cardiology ward as KD. Examination revealed he still was febrile but in good spirits. There were some congestive rashes all over the body. The laterocervical lymph nodes were swollen. He had nonsuppurative bilateral conjunctivitis, red lips, and strawberry tongue. Neurological system was normal. Others were normal. Admission blood test revealed WBC 17.6 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L. CRP 16.3 mg/L. Cervical ultrasonic showed lymphadenopathy on both sides, the bigger one was 2.0 cm × 0.6 cm. He was diagnosed with KD and treated with 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> IVIG 1 g/kg/day for 2 days; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> oral aspirin 30–50 mg/kg/day and dipyridamole 3–5 mg/kg/day, in three divided doses.

【3】On Day 6, test results showed negative MP-IgM and CP-IgM, MP IgG 1:160, ESR 66 mm/h, urinary protein (+), RBC 7.0/HP, WBC 11.03/HP. He was given oral azithromycin 10 mg/kg/day for 3 days. On Day 8, his fever settled over 48 h and urine routine test result was normal. The dosage of aspirin was reduced to 3–5 mg/kg/day. On Day 10, he was in good condition. Retested results showed WBC 8.29 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, Hb 106 g/L, PLT 649 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L. CRP 7.11 mg/L; Liver function ALB 31.8 g/L, ALT 12 U/L, AST 33 U/L.

Total protein level in urine was normal. The BP of the child was normal, and there was no edema around the body. He was treated with albumin 1 g/kg/day for 2 days. Further examination showed that ceruloplasmin, antinuclear antibody series, and ANCA were normal. Fundus photography was normal. On Day 14, he was afebrile for 5 days. Retested renal ultrasound was normal 删除33：<u></u>. Urine routine showed urinary protein (+), RBC 26.75/HP, WBC 00.63/HP, RBC deformity rate 70%. Urine β <sub>2 </sub> micro-globulin determination was normal. Renal tubule function test results showed urinary micro-albumin 195 mg/dl (0–1.9), urinary transferrin 8.94 mg/dl, urinary IgG 21.5 mg/dl (0–0.8), urinary α1-micro-globulin was normal. Total urine protein was 0.82 g/day (0–0.15). Renal ECT revealed GFR of both kidneys were normal, but slow excretion 删除33：<u></u>. The parents refused to give consent for further examinations on the massive proteinuria, and the patient was discharged.

【21】### 7.2.4 Discussion

【22】He had met the criteria of KD: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> fever for 5 days and oral antibiotics were not effective; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> conjunctival injection without exudation; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> generalized rash; 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> red lips; 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> cervical lymphadenopathy about 2.0 × 0.6 cm.

【23】He had met the criteria of recurrent KD: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> had fever for 5 days and intravenous antibiotics were not effective; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> had been diagnosed with KD 14 months ago; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> had conjunctival congestion without exudation; 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> had red lips; 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> had left cervical lymphadenopathy about 1.3 cm × 0.8 cm.

【24】### 7.2.5 Case Specific Clinic Features

【25】1.  1.
    KD has syndromes with unknown causes. It typically affects infants and toddlers, and causes systemic vasculitis. The most common pathologic findings include systemic vasculitis and a high incidence of inflammatory lesions affecting various organs, such as liver, kidney, lungs, and nervous system. More and more attentions had been paid to KD complicated with kidney injury in recent years. The involvement of the genitourinary tract in KD manifests itself clinically in various forms. The most common presentations are sterile pyuria and proteinuria; fewer patients have transient microscopic hematuria. Although they are rare, severe complications such as renovascular hypertension, hemolytic uremic syndrome, interstitial nephritis, and acute renal failure have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 6 , 7 \]</u>.
2.  2.
    Histological findings included a normal glomerulus or mild expansion of the mesangial matrix; interstitial infiltration of lymphocytes, plasmocytes, and eosinophils; and a focus of tubular necrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 8 \]</u>. There are also a few literatures suggesting that KD may affect renal parenchyma. Renal scar formation was found about half a year after KD diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 3 \]</u>.
3.  3.
    In this case, when the patient was diagnosed with KD at first time, urine routine test indicated urinary protein (+), RBC 7.0/HP, WBC 11.03/HP. The second time he was diagnosed with KD, urine routine test showed that protein level was increased (+++), RBC 491.35/HP, and WBC 10.4/HP. Urologic ultrasonography revealed diffuse injury on both kidneys, but with normal Cr and BUN. RBC malformation rate was 70% indicating RBC coming from glomerular. After IVIG treatment, urine protein was regressed to (+), RBC was reduced to 26.75/HP, WBC was normal. In addition, urine β <sub>2 </sub> micro-globulin was slightly increased, which suggest impaired renal tubular function. The increased urine transferrin suggested impaired renal glomerular function, too. But, normal Cr and BUN implied there were no severe renal function damages. Furthermore, kidney ultrasound showed they were recovered to normal, and urine β <sub>2 </sub> micro-globulin was recovered, which suggested that the impaired renal tubular function may be transient and reversible. Further increased urinary transferrin suggested unrecovered glomerular function. Normal GRF but slow excretion indicated the injury was there for some time. This may be the reason to keep hematuria, and requires dynamic follow-up.
4.  4.
    To determine the causes of hematuria proteinuria whether by KD-related vasculitis or by other immune-related diseases prior to KD, we test ANCA and antinuclear antibody serial examinations, but we did not find abnormalities. His parents refused to give consent on further tests including immunodeficiency screening, abdominal CT, lipid, scleral ciliary body, and nephrodialysis.
5.  5.
    This was the first time for us to see KD children with both hematuria and proteinuria diagnosed in our center. With the improvement of the disease, the urine routine test results returned to normal at his first time KD, which was consistent with the literature reports. After the recurrence of KD, obvious hematuria and proteinuria were found in the acute phase, and the 24-h urine protein quantification reached the nephropathy standard. Although the urine routine was slightly improved at convalescence period at 2 months of illness, his conditions met the guideline standard for stopping all drugs. The urine routine was still abnormal. The long-term prognosis for this patient is unknown because we have not been given a chance to follow up with him.
