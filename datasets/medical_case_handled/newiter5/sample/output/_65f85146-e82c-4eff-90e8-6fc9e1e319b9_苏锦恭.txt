【13】Questions

【14】•	 How would you investigate and manage this patient?

【15】•	 What is the likely diagnosis?

【16】ANSWER 66

【17】The patient has acute gonorrhoea and gonococcal arthritis. The X-ray of the knee is normal.
The diagnosis is made by microscopy of the discharge, which should show Gram-positive  删除换行1 diplococci, and culture of a urethral swab. The swab should be inoculated to fresh appropriate medium straight away and kept at 37°C until arrival at the laboratory. Immediate treatment on clinical grounds with ciprofloxacin is indicated; penicillin should be reserved for  删除换行1 gonorrhoea with known penicillin sensitivity to prevent the development of resistant strains.
Septic monoarthritis is a complication of gonorrhoea; other metastatic infectious complications are skin lesions and, rarely, perihepatitis, bacterial endocarditis and meningitis.
The patient disclosed that he had had unprotected sexual intercourse with prostitutes in  删除换行5 Thailand and Singapore; he had had no intercourse following return to the United Kingdom,  删除换行1 so no follow-up of contacts was necessary. For advice on precautions and investigation for  删除换行1 other sexually transmitted diseases he was referred to the sexually transmitted diseases  删除换行1 (STD) clinic.
