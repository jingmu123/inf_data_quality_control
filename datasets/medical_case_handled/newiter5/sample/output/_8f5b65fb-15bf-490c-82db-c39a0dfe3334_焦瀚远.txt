【0】CASE 14: A PATIENT PRESENTS ACUTELY UNWELL WITH ALL HIS

【1】SKIN RED AND HOT

【2】History

【3】A 50-year-old man presents to the on-call dermatologist with a 3-day history of rigors,  删除换行1 feeling generally unwell and redness of all his skin associated with scaling. He also  删除换行1 complains of swelling of his arms and legs. Since his teenage years he has suffered with  删除换行1 a scaly scalp and occasional dry patches on the elbows. There is a family history of psoriasis. Recently he has been experiencing increasing episodes of angina and has sought  删除换行1 medical attention.

【4】Examination

【5】There is widespread erythema affecting the face, trunk and limbs with thickening of the  删除换行1 skin and associated widespread scale 删除33：<u></u>. Thick scale is present throughout the  删除换行1 scalp with dystrophy of all 20 nails. Over the elbows erythematous plaques with overlying  删除换行1 thick scale are seen. In addition there are mild bilateral ectropions.

【6】Questions

【7】• What is the likely diagnosis?

【8】• What is the differential diagnosis?

【9】• How would you manage this patient?

【10】• What are the potential complications?

【12】ANSWER 14

【13】The most likely diagnosis is erythrodermic psoriasis. Erythroderma is when almost the  删除换行1 entire skin ( 90%) becomes red; in the case of psoriasis the skin is also thickened and  删除换行1 scaly. There is usually hyperkeratosis of the palmar/plantar sites. There may be onycholysis (lifting of the nail plates) and even shedding of the nails. Thinning of the hair and  删除换行1 alopecia may also occur. Clues in this patient to the underlying cause of his erythroderma  删除换行1 are his dystrophic nails and classic plaques of psoriasis over his elbows. In addition he  删除换行1 has a history of scalp scaling and a family history of psoriasis.

【14】Erythrodema is a serious and at times life-threatening dermatological emergency.
Erythrodermic skin is associated with fever, rigors and lymphadenopathy.
Other causes of erythroderma include atopic eczema, drug eruptions, cutaneous T-cell  删除换行1 lymphoma, allergic contact dermatitis, pityriasis rubra pilaris and seborrheoic dermatitis.
To diagnose the underlying cause can be very challenging and signs and symptoms of  删除换行1 pre-existing dermatoses may help, as in this case.

【15】Complications result from significant physiological and metabolic changes that occur  删除换行1 when the skin barrier function starts to fail. Thermoregulatory control is lost, leaving  删除换行1 patients vulnerable to hypothermia due to excess heat loss. Dehydration commonly  删除换行1 occurs owing to increased transepidermal water. Cutaneous inflammation may mask  删除换行1 concurrent secondary skin infection and blood cultures may be positive owing to their  删除换行1 easy contamination with normal skin flora. Hypoalbuminaemia and cardiac failure are  删除换行1 serious complications that particularly affect the elderly.

【16】Treatment is supportive. In-patient management and skilled nursing care are essential.
Close monitoring of pulse, blood pressure, temperature and fluid balance is mandatory.
Hourly emollient therapy with liquid paraffin and mild topical steroids are the mainstay  删除换行1 of the acute phase. The use of systemic corticosteroids in the acute setting is controversial, as there is some evidence they can exacerbate the condition and may even have been  删除换行1 the initial trigger. Adequate nutritional support to minimize protein losses is important.
Haemodynamic instability and intercurrent infections are treated as necessary.

【17】Patients usually require systemic therapy; historically ciclosporin has been given for  删除换行1 its fast mode of action. However, some dermatologists are now treating these very sick  删除换行1 patients with first-line systemic anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha preparations such as  删除换行1 infliximab.

【18】 KEY POINTS

【19】• Erythroderma is when almost the entire skin ( 90%) becomes red.

【20】• It is a serious and at times life-threatening dermatological emergency.

【21】• Management is supportive in addition to treatment of the underlying cause.焦瀚远
