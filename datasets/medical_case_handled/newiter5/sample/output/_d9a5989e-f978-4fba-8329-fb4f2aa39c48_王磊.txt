【0】CASE 22: POSTMENOPAUSAL BLEEDING

【1】History

【2】A 58-year-old woman reports postmenopausal bleeding for 6 months. Initially she did not 删除换行1 pay much attention to it but she has had several episodes and it now occurs most days. It 删除换行1 is generally light but for a few days recently it was almost like a period. There is no associated pain. The woman has never married or been sexually active. She has no previous 删除换行1 gynaecological history and has never had a smear test. She was diagnosed with type 2 删除换行1 diabetes 4 years ago for which she takes oral hypoglycaemics. However she is not very 删除换行1 compliant with diet modification, and her blood glucose is not well controlled such that 删除换行1 starting insulin is being considered.

【3】Examination

【4】The woman is obese with a body mass index of 32 kg/m2 删除换行1 . Her blood pressure is 删除换行1 150/80 mmHg. The abdomen is non-tender, but due to her adiposity it is not possible to 删除换行1 feel abdominal masses.

【5】External genital examination is unremarkable. Speculum and bimanual examination are 删除换行1 not performed as she has never been sexually active.

【6】Transvaginal ultrasound was not possible and a transabdominal ultrasound examination 删除换行1 was therefore performed with a full bladder.

【7】Transabdominal ultrasound report: the uterus is normal size and anteverted. The 删除换行1 endometrium could not be clearly visualized. Both ovaries appear normal. Ultrasound view 删除换行1 was restricted by patient adiposity.

【8】Examination under anaesthetic and hysteroscopy: the vagina and cervix appear normal.

【9】Hysteroscopy showed an irregular vascular mass arising from the uterine wall with contact 删除换行1 bleeding. Curettage was performed and products sent for histological examination.

【10】The findings at hysteroscopy are shown in Fig. 22.1.

【11】INVESTIGATIONS

【12】Questions

【13】• What is the likely diagnosis?

【14】• If this is confirmed how would you manage this patient?

【18】Postmenopausal bleeding should be considered to be due to endometrial carcinoma until 删除换行1 proven otherwise. In many cases the diagnosis turns out to be benign. However, in this 删除换行1 case early suspicion is raised by the risk factors for endometrial carcinoma:

【19】• type 2 diabetes

【20】• obesity

【21】• nulliparity.

【22】There is also a long history of significant bleeding suggesting a more significant pathology. In women who can tolerate the examination, the diagnosis may be made by outpatient endometrial sampling. In this case however, the inability to examine properly meant 删除换行1 it was appropriate to investigate the uterine cavity and the rest of the lower genital tract 删除换行1 under anaesthetic. The diagnosis of endometrial cancer was confirmed on histology report 删除换行1 from the curettage specimen.

【23】Management

【24】Management of endometrial carcinoma is simple total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingoophorectomy, as 90 per cent of women present with early-stage disease.

【25】Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan prior to the procedure may be carried out to 删除换行1 check for possible lymph node involvement, in which case lymph node biopsy should be 删除换行1 performed at the time of surgery. Cases of stage 2 or greater disease are less common and 删除换行1 need adjuvant radiotherapy.

【26】Histology is needed to stage endometrial cancer:

【27】• stage 1: confined to the body of the uterus

【28】• 1a limited to the endometrium

【29】• 1b invasion only of the inner half of the myometrium

【30】• 1c invasion to the outer half the of the myometrium

【31】• stage 2: involving the uterus and cervix only

【32】• stage 3: extending beyond the uterus but not beyond the true pelvis

【33】• stage 4: extending beyond the true pelvis or into the bladder or rectum.

【34】The woman should be advised that the prognosis is generally good with over 70 per cent 删除换行1 survival at 5 years for stage 1 disease, though it is only 10 per cent for stage 4 disease.

【35】• Postmenopausal bleeding is due to endometrial cancer until proven otherwise.

【36】• Women with prolonged or heavy bleeding are more likely to have pathology.

【37】• Endometrial cancer is staged histologically.
