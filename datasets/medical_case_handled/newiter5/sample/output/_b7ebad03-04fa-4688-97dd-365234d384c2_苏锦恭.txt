【0】Question: 2.1 A 6-month-old infant presents with an oral yeast infection and the patient history reveals that there have been persistent infections since approximately 1 month of age. Blood work reveals decreased numbers of T and B lymphocytes, and you thus suspect an immunodeficiency. Which of the following laboratory results would specifically implicate ADA deficiency as the molecular basis for the immunodeficiency seen in this patient?

【1】A. Increased adenosine and deoxyadenosine in the blood

【2】B. Elevated inosine and deoxyinosine in the blood

【3】C. Decreased levels of adenosine and deoxyadenosine in the blood

【4】D. Increased glucose levels in the blood

【5】E. Increased creatinine levels in the blood

【6】Answer: 2.1 A. ADA is responsible for deaminating adenosine and deoxyadenosine, hence, elevations in adenosine and deoxyadenosine are specifically diagnostic for ADA deficiency.

【7】Question: 2.2 With a patient diagnosed with ADA-deficient SCID, which of the following treatment approaches is most likely to be successful?

【8】A. Kidney transplantation

【9】B. Liver transplantation together with immunoglobulin therapy

【10】C. ADA enzyme replacement therapy

【11】D. Immunoglobulin therapy

【12】E. Dietary restriction of adenine

【13】Answer: 2.2 C. ADA enzyme replacement therapy is an approach that can increase ADA enzymatic activity in patients that will lead to a lowering of ADA substrates and an attenuation of the associated phenotypes.

【14】Question: 2.3 Which of the following clinical parameters should be followed in an ADA-deficient patient following the use of ADA enzyme replacement therapy to assess the efficacy of the therapy?

【15】A. Blood urea nitrogen

【16】B. Erythrocyte cell counts

【17】C. Ferritin levels

【18】D. Hemoglobin levels

【19】E. Immunoglobulin levels

【20】Answer: 2.3 E. Diminished immunoglobulin levels are indicative of decreased immune function and are a prominent feature of ADA deficiency. Thus, monitoring immunoglobulin levels is a way of assessing the efficacy of ADA enzyme replacement therapy. An increase in immunoglobulin levels is a positive result.

【21】Question: 2.4 A deficiency of ADA can lead to lymphopenia and immune dysfunction. The accumulation of which substance is most likely to result in these lymphotoxic effects?

【22】A. Adenosine

【23】B. Deoxyadenosine

【24】C. Hypoxanthine

【25】D. Inosine

【26】E. Uric acid
Answer: 2.4 B. Deoxyadenosine is the primary lymphotoxic substance that accumulates as a result of adenosine deaminase deficiency. It can be phosphorylated to dATP, an accumulation of which leads to programmed cell death (apoptosis) of lymphoid cells. An accumulation of adenosine also occurs due to ADA deficiency, but it is not lymphotoxic. A buildup of adenosine can lead to neurologic as well as liver, kidney, and lung disorders. Inosine, hypoxanthine, and uric acid are downstream metabolites of ADA and would not be expected to accumulate with a deficiency in the enzyme.

【27】BIOCHEMISTRY PEARLS

【28】 ADA deficiency was the first immunodeficiency disease for which the molecular defect was identified.

【29】 ADA catalyzes the deamination of adenosine and deoxyadenosine to inosine and deoxyinosine, respectively.

【30】 Elevations in deoxyadenosine that occur in response to ADA deficiency are cytotoxic to cells and lead to apoptosis, a form of cell death (in this case loss of lymphocytes).苏锦恭
