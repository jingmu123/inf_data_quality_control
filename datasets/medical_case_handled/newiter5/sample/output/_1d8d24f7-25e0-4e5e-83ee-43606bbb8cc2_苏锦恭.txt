【0】Case 18 删除换行1 45-Year-Old Woman With Corticotropin-Independent Cushing Syndrome and Bilateral Adrenal Adenomas 删除换行5 Management of corticotropin (ACTH)-independent hypercortisolism in patients with bilateral adrenal nodules depends on imaging findings (adenomas versus macronodular hyperplasia) and tumor size. Adrenal venous sampling (AVS) is useful in patients with bilateral adrenal adenomas of similar size to guide surgical management.

【1】Case Report

【2】A 45-year-old woman presented for evaluation of self-diagnosed Cushing syndrome (CS). Over the prior 2 years， she progressively gained weight with abdominal fat redistribution， developed striae over her abdomen， supraclavicular and dorsocervical fat pads， hair loss， mood swings， anxiety， depression， insomnia， and signs of proxi-mal myopathy (that she noticed on climbing up the stairs). She had also noticed facial rounding and erythema. Despite working out in the gym， she was unable to lose weight. In addition， she reported a new-onset hypertension and a new-onset diabetes mellitus type 2 (hemoglobin A1C，6.7%) diagnosed 6 months previously. Medica-tions included lisinopril， hydrochlorothiazide， and metformin. The patient researched her con-stellation of symptoms and suspected CS. Further workup at home confirmed hypercortisolism. On physical examination， her blood pressure Was172/105 mmHg and body mass index was

【3】34.2 kg/m2. She had abdominal striae， facial round-ing and erythema， dorsocervical pad， and supracla-vicular pads.

【4】INVESTIGATIONS

【5】After confirmation of ACTH-independent hypercorti-solism ， abdominal imaging was obtained. Ablominal computed tomography demonstrated bilateral adrenal nodules， 2.6 cm on the right and2.8 cm on the left 删除33：<u></u>. As imaging phenotype was not consistent with bilateral macronodular hyper-plasia， AVS was performed to identify the source of autonomous cortisol secretion. In preparation for the AVS procedure， dexamethasone 0.5 mg was initiated on the morning the day prior and every 6 hours， including the morning of AVS. Cosyntropin (which is commonly infused during AVS in patients with pri-mary aldosteronism) was not administered. Concen-trations of cortisol and epinephrine were measured in inferior vena cava (IVC) and both adrenal veins (Box18.1). Based on the left adrenal yein-to-IVC cortisol ratio of 17.2 and the left adrenal vein to right adrenal vein cortisol ratio of 3.9， ACTH-independent hyper-cortisolism due to the dominant left adrenal adenoma was diagnosed， and left adrenalectomy was recom-mended. However， the patient was advised that she may continue to demonstrate a mild autonomous cor-tisol secretion from the right adrenal adenoma， given the right adrenal vein to inferior vena cava ratio of 4.4.

【11】aAVS completed under continuous dexamethasone suppres-sion of 0.5 mg every 6 hours started 24 hours before the AVS. bAdrenal vein epinephrine concentrations of at least 100 pg/mL more than concentrations in the inferior vena cava were used to confirm successful adrenal vein cannulation.

【12】Interpretation： Cortisol AV/IVC ratio >6.5 confirms autono-mous cortisol secretion from the adrenal gland， while cortisol AV/IVC ratio <3.3 excludes it. Cortisol LAV/RAV>2.3 confirms predominantly unilateral autonomous cortisol secretion. AVS， Adrenal venous sampling； IVC， inferior vena cava； LAV， left 删除换行1 adrenal vein； RAV， right adrenal vein.

【13】TREATMENT

【14】Patient was treated with a laparoscopic left adrenalec-tomy that revealed a 2.6-cm pigmented adrenal cor-tical adenoma 删除33：<u></u>. Following adrenalectomy， she developed secondary adrenal insufficiency that resolved 15 months later， at which point she discon-tin11P(tinued hydrocortisone. She was very pleased with res-olution of diabetes mellitus type 2 and hypertension， weight loss of 20 pounds， and a significant improve-ment in anxiety. Two years after left adrenalectomy， abdominal imaging was repeated and redemonstrated a right 2.6-cm stable adrenal adenoma. While the features of overt CS resolved， repeat workup demon-strated mild glucocorticoid autonomy (cortisol after the 1-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test was 3.2 mcg/dL \[normal <1.8\]). Clinical monitoring was implemented.

【15】Causes of the ACTH-independent hypercortisolism due to bilateral adrenal disease include bilateral adeno-mas， bilateral macronodular hyperplasia， and bilateral micronodular hyperplasia . Bilateral adre-nal cortical carcinoma is extremely rare and is unlikely to occur outside of a genetic syndrome. Imaging can frequently distinguish a single adenoma from a mac-ronodular hyperplasia， though this may not always 删除换行4 be straightforward. While macronodular hyperplasia presents with bilateral cortisol secretion， this may not be the case in a patient with bilateral adenomas (when one adrenal adenoma may be cortisol-secreting， while 删除换行1 the other one is nonfunctioning). AVS in these situa-tions can be useful， as illustrated in this case.1.2 Adre-nal vein cortisol ratio >2.3 in these cases identifies the culprit lesion.2 Notably， in patients with bilateral adenomas of unequal size， cortisol secretion usually originates from the much larger adrenal mass， and in these cases， AVS may not be needed.

【16】Key Points

【17】●Adrenal imaging is the first step to determine the etiology of ACTH-independent hypercortisolism.

【18】● AVS under dexamethasone suppression， with cortisol and epinephrine measurements， is useful in patients with ACTH-independent hypercorti-solism and imaging suggestive of bilateral adrenal adenomas.

【19】●AVS is not indicated in patients with unilateral adenoma， bilateral micronodular hyperplasia， or macronodular hyperplasia.

【20】●AVS may not be useful in patients with bilateral adenomas with significant differences in size(>2 cm)， as cortisol secretion usually originates from the larger adrenal mass.苏锦恭
