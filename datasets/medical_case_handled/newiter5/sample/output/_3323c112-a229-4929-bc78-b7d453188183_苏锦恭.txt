===================================================

【2】Introduction
------------

【3】Movement of ions across a phospholipid bilayer requires the presence of transport proteins. Different types of transport proteins are specific to different ions. While some transport proteins form an open channel for the passive diffusion of ions, others only allow transport to occur under certain circumstances. These gated channels undergo a conformation change, transitioning from a “closed” to an “open” state, and back again. Examples of the physiological triggers for gated channels include ligand binding, mechanical deformation, and changes in voltage across the membrane.

【4】Voltage-gated channels are proteins that can respond to small changes in membrane potential or the distribution of charge across a phospholipid bilayer. Voltage-gated channels play a vital role in the process of nerve cell communication through their involvement in production of an action potential. In order for a voltage-gated protein to function it must be capable of “sensing” differences in charge across a membrane. Voltage-gated channels are integral membrane proteins with multiple, alpha helical, transmembrane domains. Some of these domains contribute to the formation of a channel that selectively allows for the diffusion of an ion. Other transmembrane domains are able to respond to changes in electrical charge due to the presence of acidic or basic amino acids.

【5】▪ Explain why an ion must move through a transport protein and cannot simply diffuse through a phospholipid bilayer.

【6】▪ What determines the direction of movement of an ion?

【7】▪ Research/review examples of the three types of gated channels mentioned earlier.

【8】▪ Describe the properties associated with a transmembrane domain.

【9】▪ Predict how a transmembrane domain of a voltage-gated channel with arginine amino acids near the extracellular side of the membrane would respond to an increase in calcium ions outside the cell.

【10】Background
----------

【11】The unicellular green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii swim through their aqueous environment using flagella. The coordinated movement of these two flagella, in a breaststroke-like pattern, propels the cell forward. Chlamydomonas are photosynthetic and so are attracted to light. However, exposure to intense light causes the flagella to change their beat pattern, switching to a more undulating or S-shaped pattern, and causing the cell to reverse direction, a behavior known as photophobic response . Alteration of the flagellar waveform requires an influx of extracellular calcium ions into the flagella.

【12】The Chlamydomonas mutant, ppr2 , lacks a photophobic response. The ppr2 gene shares homology with voltage-gated calcium channels. A search of the Chlamydomonas genomic database revealed the presence of eight voltage-gated calcium channels genes that share sequence homology with ppr2 . The experiments described in this case study investigate the role of voltage-gated calcium channels in the photophobic response of Chlamydomonas .

【13】▪ Are Chlamydomonas prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells?

【14】▪ Speculate on why a photosynthetic cell would avoid intense light.

【15】▪ What proteins are responsible for the movement of the flagellar axoneme?

【16】▪ The Chlamydomonas eyespot responds to bursts of intense light by altering the cell’s membrane potential. How does this fact contribute to your understanding of the photophobic response?

【17】Methods
-------

【18】### Cell cultures

【19】Wild-type and mutant strain ppr2 of C. reinhardtii were used in these experiments. Cells were cultured at 25°C in TAP medium using a 12-h light, 12-h dark light cycle.

【20】### Reverse transcriptase – PCR of regenerating flagella

【21】Flagella were detached from the cells using pH shock, and total RNA was extracted from flagellar-regenerating cells at the times indicated. Equal amounts of total RNA were reverse-transcribed into cDNA using Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase. PCR was performed on each of the samples using primers that were specific to a 120–200 base pair fragment of fructose-bisphosphate aldolase 3, beta tubulin, or CAV2. Expression of fructose-bisphosphate aldolase 3 was assumed to be unaffected by flagellar regrowth. Calculation of the amounts of beta tubulin and CAV2 RNA were normalized to fructose-bisphosphate aldolase 3.

【22】### RNA interference suppression of CAV2 expression

【23】CAV2 gene expression was knocked down using RNA interference. Genomic DNA sequences corresponding to exons 1–3 of the CAV2 gene was inserted into an RNAi vector and wild-type Chlamydomonas were transformed by electroporation. Transformants were evaluated by the level of CAV2 expression and their ability to respond to high-intensity light.

【24】### CAV2 antibodies

【25】Polyclonal antibodies specific to CAV2 were developed. For immunoblotting, cells in the logarithmic growth phase were pH-shocked to remove their flagella. Flagella were collected by centrifugation and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by blotting onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were reacted with dilute primary antibody to CAV2, washed, and reacted with an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. Antibody binding was detected by chemiluminescence.

【26】Localization of CAV2 and alpha tubulin in flagella was achieved by immunofluorescence labeling. Cells were fixed in 1.8% formaldehyde for 20 min and washed with buffer. Chlamydomonas were allowed to adhere to the glass slide and then the cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, washed with buffer, and reacted with the CAV2 primary antibody. The samples was washed again and reacted with a FITC-conjugated secondary antibody. Labeled cells were viewed using a fluorescence microscope.

【27】▪ Why was it necessary to grow Chlamydomonas with a light/dark cycle?

【28】▪ Predict how the RT-PCR experimental results would be altered if fructose-bisphosphate aldolase expression did change during flagellar regeneration.

【29】▪ Why was a permeabilization step included for the immunofluorescence experiments? How would you change the methods if your goal were to demonstrate that CAV2 is located in the flagellar PM?

【30】Results
