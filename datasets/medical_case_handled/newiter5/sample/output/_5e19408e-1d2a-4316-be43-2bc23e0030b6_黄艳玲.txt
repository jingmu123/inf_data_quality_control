【0】CASE 26

【1】A 46-year-old woman visits her physician complaining of "feeling poorly，" with fever， chills， muscle aches， dry cough， and sore throat. She has had these symptoms for several days with no significant improvement. She works as a secretary and says these symptoms have been "going around the office."Physical examination reveals small， tender cervical lymphadenopathy， swollen nasal mucosa， and an erythematous pharynx.

【2】What is the most likely diagnosis?

【3】Infection with influenza virus.

【4】What are the defining structural features of this class of microorganisms?

【5】Orthomyxoviruses are helical， enveloped， negative， single-stranded RNA viruses. Their primary virulence factors are hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. Hemagglutinin aids in the viral entry into host cells whereas neuraminidase aids in progeny release from infected host cells. The isotypes of these two proteins determine the virulence of each particular strain of virus and are the targets of the influenza vaccine.

【6】The patient has had a similar infection in the past. Why is her immune system not protecting her from this illness?

【7】The isotype of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase is constantly changing because of a phenomenon known as antigenic drift. This is the result of random small mutations that cause changes in the antigenic structure of the virus. These mutations result in antigen structures that are only partially recognized by the host immune system.

【8】What characteristic of this microorganism's genome makes deadly epidemics possible?

【9】Influenza A virus infects diverse species including birds， horses， and swine； by contrast， influenza B and influenza C infect only humans. With its segmented genome， influenza A can swap segments of RNA between animal and human strains (a process known as reassortment)， leading to new human strains with novel surface antigens not recognized by the immune system. This type of change is termed antigenic shift and was responsible for the “swine flu" or hemagglutinin isotype 1 and neuraminidase isotype 1 (H1N1) influenza A virus outbreak in 2009.

【10】What pharmacologic agents can be used as prophylaxis against this infection?

【11】Amantadine and rimantadine block viral penetration by inhibiting the M2 protein responsible for uncoating and can be used to treat influenza A infection. However， these drugs are rarely used anymore because of the high levels of resistance that have developed against them. Instead， zanamivir and oseltamivir(neuraminidase inhibitors) are used to treat both influenza A and influenza B infections. These agents O1 O1are most effective if started within 48 hours of symptom onset. The influenza vaccine should be given in October or November， before the start of flu season. It takes approximately 2 weeks for the body to make antibodies to the viruses. The vaccine generally has four strains； the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determine which among them is likely to be the most infectious each season. The new "swine flu" H1N1 strain was included in the 2010 influenza vaccine.黄艳玲
