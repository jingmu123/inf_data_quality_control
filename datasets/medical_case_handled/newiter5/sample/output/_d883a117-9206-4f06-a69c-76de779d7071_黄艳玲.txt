【38】Discussion
----------

【39】Osteoma cutis is a benign and rare dermatological condition characterized by bone formation in the subcutaneous tissue or the deep dermis. This condition may occur at any age and can be either primary or secondary.

【40】The primary form occurs de novo without a preexisting disease. It is isolated or associated with syndromes such as Albright hereditary osteodystrophy, fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, progressive osseous heteroplasia, and Gardner’s syndrome.

【41】The secondary form represents 85% of cases and it develops in association with an underlying condition, such as inflammatory skin disease, tumors, trauma, malignancies, and scars. Acne vulgaris is the most common cause of secondary osteoma cutis.

【42】The lesions of osteoma cutis may present as papules, plaques, nodules, or military (1–4 mm) lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 1 \]</u>.

【43】The main histopathologic feature of osteoma cutis is bone formation by the process of membranous ossification in subcutaneous tissue or the deep dermis. The bone thus forms a nodule of mature lamellar bone, containing osteoblasts, rarely osteoclasts, connective tissue, and mature fat cells. Occasionally marrow elements can be seen.

【44】Treatment of osteoma cutis is mainly surgical excision of the lesion. Recurrences, especially in genetic forms, may occur 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 2 \]</u>.

【45】Calcinosis cutis, or cutaneous calcification , is the differential diagnosis for this patient. In contrast to osteoma cutis, calcinosis cutis is characterized by calcium salt deposits in the absence of osteoids. The calcified lesions are presented as palpable nodules that can vary in shape and size, depending on the calcinosis cutis subtype. They can be painful leading to functional impairment. There are five subtypes of calcinosis cutis described: dystrophic, metastatic, idiopathic, iatrogenic, and calciphylaxis 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 3 , 4 \]</u>.

【46】The dystrophic type is associated with tissue damage and is the most frequent type. It is associated with various connective tissue diseases such as systemic sclerosis, dermatomyositis, mixed connective tissue disease, which induce tissue damage and creates a favorable environment for calcification.

【47】The metastatic type is due to elevated calcium or phosphate levels.

【48】The idiopathic type includes idiopathic calcified nodules of the scrotum, subepidermal calcified nodules, and tumoral calcinosis and has no underlying tissue damage or abnormal laboratory values.

【49】Iatrogenic calcinosis is determined by the precipitation of calcium salts within the skin after administering calcium and phosphate-containing agents.

【50】Calciphylaxis involves small and medium-size vessels with vascular calcification and skin necrosis, and it is associated with chronic renal failure and dialysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 2 , 4 \]</u>.

【51】The treatment is challenging and depends on the cause. Surgical treatment is chosen for small and localized lesions, whereas more generalized disease will require medical management 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 5 \]</u>.

【52】Another condition that must be considered is dermoid cyst that typically presents as a discrete, subcutaneous nodule. Dermoid cysts result from the sequestration of ectodermal tissue along embryonic fusion planes during development 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 6 \]</u>. Dermoid cysts have a diameter between 1–4 cm. They are most commonly localized around the eyes, but they can also occur on the scalp. The cyst presents a thick wall lined with stratified squamous epithelium and may contain other typical cutaneous structures such as hair, sebaceous lobules, eccrine glands, apocrine glands, and smooth muscle. Treatment is surgical. Preoperative imaging studies may be required to exclude a connection to central nervous system 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 7 \]</u>.

【53】Pilomatrixoma , also known as calcifying epithelioma of Malherbe , is a benign tumor of the hair follicle matrix that presents as a solitary skin-colored or bluish nodule. When syndromic (myotonic dystrophy, Turner syndrome, Gardner syndrome) pilomatrixoma can present with multiple lesions. Over 70% of the tumors arise on the head and neck areas, although they may develop on any hair-bearing surface. Histopathological features of pilomatrixoma include islands of epithelial cells that contain basaloid matrical cells, shadow, ghost, or enucleated cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm, foreign body giant cells, and calcifications. Unless the lesion is symptomatic, no treatment is required 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 8 \]</u>.

【54】Keloid scars are caused by an aberrant response of the healing process that follows a cutaneous injury or irritation that reaches the reticular dermis. Clinically, they appear as raised and firm scars, containing excessive collagen production; type III collagen is replaced by type I collagen, usually after four to eight weeks from the injury. Keloids extend beyond the original wound’s borders, do not usually regress spontaneously, and tend to recur after excision 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 9 \]</u>.

【55】Key Points

【56】   Osteoma cutis refers to bone formation in the dermis and/or subcutis.
   It can be primary, but more often is secondary.
   Most common sites include the face (in female) and scalp (in male).
   It is a benign tumor with an excellent prognosis.黄艳玲
