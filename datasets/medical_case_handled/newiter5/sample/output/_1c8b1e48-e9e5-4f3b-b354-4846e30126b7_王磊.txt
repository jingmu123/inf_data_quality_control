【0】CASE 42: ‘ALIEN IMPULSES’ AND RISK TO OTHERS

【1】History

【2】A 30-year-old shop assistant presents to the emergency department requesting that they  删除换行1 remove the microchip from her brain. She says that this chip was implanted into her brain  删除换行1 some weeks ago in order that aliens could control her mind.

【3】She has previously been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and has had a number of  删除换行1 previous admissions to psychiatric hospitals, the majority of which have been involuntary  删除换行1 admissions. She has previously been treated with a number of different types of antipsychotic  删除换行1 medications, and this is currently olanzapine 20 mg once daily. Her last admission to hospital  删除换行1 was 6 months ago and since this time she has often missed her medication. She has no past  删除换行1 medical history of note.

【4】There is no family history of mental illness. She is currently living with her parents who are  删除换行1 supportive of her. From the ages of 18 to 28 she smoked high-potency cannabis (‘skunk’) on  删除换行1 an almost daily basis, but following advice and support from her community mental health  删除换行1 team she has successfully cut down her use of cannabis to approximately once every month.
She has no other history of alcohol or illicit substance abuse. Although she has no previous  删除换行1 convictions she has previously assaulted her parents and ward nursing staff when psychotic.

【5】Mental state examination

【6】She presents as unkempt and is surprised that she is being asked about her previous psychiatric history rather than being referred to a neurosurgeon for removal of the microchip.
Despite this it is possible to establish a good rapport. At several points during the interview  删除换行1 she stops speaking in mid-sentence and stares intently into one of the corners of the room  删除换行1 and begins whispering to herself.

【7】She believes that a microchip has been implanted into her brain and that aliens are using this  删除换行1 to ‘put things into my mind’. She describes how the aliens put impulses into her mind which  删除换行1 she feels compelled to act upon. For 2 days the ‘alien impulses’ have concentrated on killing  删除换行1 her mother and she is concerned that she may act upon these. She denies any hallucinations  删除换行1 but during the interview appears to be responding to unseen auditory stimuli. She has little  删除换行1 insight and does not accept that a relapse of her mental illness could be responsible for her  删除换行1 current difficulties. There is no abnormality upon physical examination.

【8】Questions

【9】• What psychopathological term could be used to describe her belief that aliens are  删除换行1 putting impulses into her brain which she must act on?

【10】• How would you assess the risk that this patient may pose to others?

【11】ANSWER 42

【12】Her belief that impulses are being put into her brain and are no longer under her control is  删除换行1 an example of passivity. The term passivity is used when the patient has the delusion that  删除换行1 some aspect that is normally under his or her own control is instead controlled by an external  删除换行1 agency. Examples of passivity phenomena are made impulses, made feelings and somatic passivity (a delusion that part of the body is under external control). Thought passivity refers to  删除换行1 the belief that thoughts are inserted, removed or blocked.

【13】There are indications from this patient’s presentation and history that she may pose a risk to  删除换行1 others and in particular her mother. She is experiencing passivity phenomena that include  删除换行1 the made impulse to kill her mother. In addition to this she has a history of assaults upon  删除换行1 others (including her parents) when unwell. Her risk to others is also increased by her lack of  删除换行1 insight, poor compliance and history of cannabis abuse.

【14】A comprehensive risk assessment is essential in this case. In order to do this it is important  删除换行1 to obtain relevant information from as many sources as possible. This could include a more  删除换行1 detailed history and mental state examination from the patient, discussion with an informant  删除换行1 (her parents would be especially helpful in this case) and previous psychiatric and medical  删除换行1 records and information from any professionals recently involved in her care (such as community psychiatric nurse, social worker or general practitioner). This information should  删除换行1 then be used to evaluate the presence/absence of relevant risk factors.

【15】Other areas of risk that should be  删除换行1 explored include risk of harm to  删除换行1 self or suicide, risk of exploitation  删除换行1 and risk of neglect. A summary  删除换行1 judgement of risk should then be  删除换行1 made. This should include what the  删除换行1 risk is, who is at risk and the likelihood of this harm occurring. From  删除换行1 this should follow an appropriate  删除换行1 risk management plan. In this case  删除换行1 it would be appropriate to consider  删除换行1 admitting the patient to hospital.
Given the risk here, if this offer  删除换行1 is declined consider involuntary  删除换行1 admission using appropriate legislation, e.g. the Mental Health Act  删除换行1 通用删除7(英):<u>(1983)</u> in England.
