【0】CASE 14: DOSE-RESPONSE CURVES

【1】History and examination

【2】A 40-year-old man was brought to hospital after being found collapsed in the street. He had  删除换行1 a syringe and needle in his hand when he was found. The paramedics examined the patient  删除换行1 and found that he was unresponsive to voice and pain. His pupils were 1–2 mm bilaterally.
His heart rate was 50 bpm and his respiratory rate was 4 breaths per minute. No other positive findings were elicited on systemic examination.

【3】The paramedics diagnosed opioid toxicity and administered naloxone. The patient regained  删除换行1 consciousness and was brought to hospital where he recovered well. His blood results were  删除换行1 sent for toxicological screening and were positive for both fentanyl and heroin. The patient  删除换行1 expressed an ongoing desire to abstain from intravenous drug use and was eventually admitted to an inpatient drug rehabilitation unit. He commenced treatment with buprenorphine  删除换行1 to support his gradual withdrawal from opioid use 删除33：<u></u>.

【6】Questions

【7】1. The  patient was treated with naloxone, and subsequently with buprenorphine.
What is the mechanism of action of these two drugs?

【8】2. This patient has been exposed to a number of drugs in the history relayed above,  删除换行1 including heroin, fentanyl, buprenorphine and naloxone. Can you suggest which of  删除换行1 these drugs are depicted in the dose-response curves A, B, C and D?

【9】ANSWERS

【10】1. Naloxone is a non-selective competitive µ-opioid receptor antagonist that can be  删除换行1 administered by intravenous, intramuscular or nasal routes to treat opioid overdoses. Naloxone competitively binds to the µ-opioid receptor, thus preventing  删除换行1 both endogenous and exogenous opioids from binding and exerting their effects.
Naloxone is rapidly distributed and metabolised and thus has a rapid duration of  删除换行1 effect. Patients with significant opioid toxicity may require multiple doses of naloxone, or even a continuous intravenous infusion to prevent respiratory depression.

【11】 Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the µ-opioid receptor that is prescribed to  删除换行1 reduce dependence on opioids, such as heroin. The drug has a strong affinity for  删除换行1 the µ-opioid receptor, competitively preventing other opioids from binding. Due to  删除换行1 its partial agonist activity, buprenorphine does not induce significant pleasurable  删除换行1 effects such as euphoria, in contrast with other opioids.

【12】2. The dose-response curves show the potency and efficacy of the four drugs discussed: 

【13】heroin, fentanyl, buprenorphine and naloxone. Drugs A and B are similarly efficacious, both achieving a similar level of response to the drugs. Drug A is more potent  删除换行1 than Drug B however, meaning that smaller doses of Drug A are required to achieve  删除换行1 maximal response compared with Drug B. In  this scenario, Drug A  is fentanyl,  删除换行1 which is an extremely potent opioid that is commonly mixed with heroin, and small  删除换行1 quantities of this drug can cause fatal overdoses. Drug B is heroin.

【14】 Drug C is the partial µ-opioid receptor agonist, Buprenorphine, which is considerably less efficacious compared with fentanyl and heroin. Drug D is naloxone,  删除换行1 the µ-opioid receptor antagonist that competes with other opioids and thus reduces  删除换行1 their analgesic and depressive effects.

【15】Key Points

【16】1. Naloxone is a non-selective competitive µ-opioid receptor antagonist that can  删除换行1 be administered by intravenous, intramuscular or nasal routes to treat opioid  删除换行1 overdoses.

【17】2. Dose-response curves plot the biological response for a particular drug against  删除换行1 the doses required to achieve that response. This allows us to assess and compare  删除换行1 the efficacy and potency of drugs.黄艳玲
