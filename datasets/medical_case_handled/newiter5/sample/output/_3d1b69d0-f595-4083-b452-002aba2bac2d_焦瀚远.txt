【0】Question: A 64-year-old woman presents to the physician because of new onset postmenopausal bleeding. Ultrasonography reveals a small mass in the left adnexa, along with a thickened endometrial stripe. A biopsy of her left ovary reveals the presence of Call-Exner bodies. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

【1】> (A) Endometrioid tumor

【2】> (B) Granulosa cell tumor

【3】> (C) Krukenberg tumor

【4】> (D) Serous cystadenocarcinoma

【5】> (E) Teratoma
 Answer: The correct answer is B. The classic histologic finding in a granulosa cell tumor of the ovary is the presence of Call-Exner bodies, which are follicles with granulosa cells haphazardly arranged around a space containing eosinophilic secretions. The clinical presentation also supports this diagnosis. About two-thirds of ovarian granulosa cell tumors occur in postmenopausal women (average age at menopause in the United States is 51 years). Granulosa cell tumors are usually estrogen-secreting, but occasionally produce androgens leading to virilization. Estrogen-secreting tumors in children and adolescents can cause precocious puberty. In adults they are often associated with endometrial hyperplasia, cystic breast disease, and endometrial carcinoma. Up to 15% of patients with estrogen-secreting tumors develop an endometrial carcinoma. Evidence of increased endometrial thickness (revealing hyperplasia or carcinoma) is found in this patient as a thickened endometrial stripe on ultrasonography. The endometrial stripe is an area of the endometrium with differing echogenicity, allowing the thickness to be measured. This increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma is due to the unopposed estrogen secretion by the tumor, which stimulates growth of the endometrium. This abnormal endometrial growth leads to subsequent sloughing off, resulting in abnormal vaginal bleeding, a common presentation of endometrial abnormalities.  
Answer A is incorrect. An endometrioid tumor, as the name suggests, histologically resembles endometrium. It does not have Call-Exner bodies on histologic examination, and because it does not secrete estrogen, it would not present with vaginal bleeding and a thickened endometrial stripe.  
Answer C is incorrect. Krukenberg tumors are tumors that are metastatic to the ovaries from the GI system, most commonly the stomach. The classic histologic finding is a mucinsecreting signet-ring cell, not a Call-Exner body.  
Answer D is incorrect. Call-Exner bodies would not be found in serous cystadenocarcinoma. Instead, one would expect to see a tumor lined with epithelium resembling that of the fallopian tube and psammoma bodies (concentric rings of calcification). These types of tumors are very common and account for >50% of ovarian carcinomas. Because they do not secrete estrogen, they do not classically present with vaginal bleeding and would not cause a thickened endometrial stripe.  
Answer E is incorrect. A teratoma contains tissue derived from at least two different embryonic layers. For example, thyroid tissue, neural tissue, muscle tissue, bone, and even teeth may be present. Immature teratomas are more aggressive and are always malignant, while mature teratomas are well differentiated and benign. One would not expect to see Call-Exner bodies or vaginal bleeding with a teratoma.焦瀚远
