【10】History and Clinical
--------------------

【11】A 46-year-old female presented with a growth on the superior right arm that had been present for 9 months. The patient had a history of a cholecystectomy and tubal ligation. A lipoma was noted on a past physical exam, but it was not removed. She was in prison 5 years ago where she contracted tuberculosis, but failed to complete the course of antibiotics prescribed.

【12】Physical Examination
--------------------

【13】Examination of the patient exhibited a prominent lipoma at her medial hypogastric region. The patient also presented with an ichthyotic lesion on her right forearm and acrochordons at her bilateral superior axilla and medial hypogastric regions. The right arm showed multiple, red papules, some of which were eroded.

【14】Clinical Differential Diagnosis
-------------------------------

【15】   Syphilis
   Sporotrichosis
   Tularemia
   Bartonellosis
   Mycobacterium
   Tuberulosis

【16】Histopathology
--------------

【17】A shave biopsy was performed on the patient’s superior right arm 删除33：<u></u>. The biopsy measured 0.6 × 0.6 × 0.5, and a separate piece measured 0.7 × 0.6 × 0.1 cm. This specimen tested negative for fungus in by Periodic Acid-Schiff stain. The microscopic presentation showed a central oval area of necrosis that was surrounded by a prominent histocytes and multi-nucleated giant cells 删除33：<u></u>. The Acid Fast Stain showed numerous positive staining organisms with a short rod appearance 删除33：<u></u>.

【28】Diagnosis
---------

【29】MYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULOSIS. Tuberculosis remains a world-wide disease with a third of the world population being infected. Most new infections are arising from Africa. HIV positive patients are at a 20× increased risk of contracting tuberculosis. The organism can be disseminated into all organs, but in the skin it often appears as “lupus vulgaris” or “scrofuloderma”. The organism grows intracellularly, and induces a granulomatous reaction.

【30】While infectious processes can have a similar clinical appearance, microscopic examination using special stains as well as immunostains aid in the identification of a specific organisms. Although tissue cultures remain the traditional method of separating certain species based on metabolic features, newer molecular techniques are gaining acceptance. Clinically, the “B” symptoms are associated with tuberculosis; weight loss, night sweats, and fever. A chest x-ray is helpful in evaluating for pulmonary disease.

【31】Treatment Options
-----------------

【32】Treatment is usually a combination therapy

【33】   Isoniazide
   Rifamycin
   Pyrazinamide
   Ethambutol
