【0】27.11 A 44-year-old cab driver is involved in a high-speed， head-on collision. In the ED， he is hemodynamically stable and has full neurologic function of his lower extremities. He is complaining of severe lower back pain. Radiographs and CT imaging are acquired of his lumbar spine. Which of the following findings is indicative of an unstable lumbar burst fracture that may need surgical stabilization?

【1】50% loss of vertebral height at the level of injury 删除换行1 20 degrees of kyphosis at the level of injury

【2】C. 30% of canal compromise

【3】D.Injury to the anterior and middle spinal columns only

【4】E.Injury to the posterior column only

【5】27.2A 43-year-old woman who fell from a third-floor balcony presents to the ED with bilateral foot numbness as well as 2/5 bilateral extensor hallucis longus(EHL) function and absent plantar flexion. Radiographs demonstrate an L5burst fracture with 40% retropulsion and 30% loss of height. On further history， the patient states she fell 4 days ago and finally sought care because she was experiencing decreasing sensation in her groin and can no longer void. What is the next most appropriate step in management?

【6】IV high-dose corticosteroids

【7】Epidural steroid injection

【8】Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)， bedrest， and appro-priate bracing

【9】D.Surgical anterior decompression with fusion

【10】E. Surgical posterior decompressive lumbar laminectomy without fusion

【11】27.3A 56-year-old male rock climber falls 8 feet from a ledge and lands on his buttocks. He arrives 6 hours later in the ED and complains of lower back pain. He is completely neurologically intact. Imaging of his lumbar spine shows an L3 burst fracture involving both anterior and middle columns with 30%loss of height anteriorly and minimal retropulsion. He has no other injuries. What is the most appropriate treatment for this patient?
A.IV steroids and appropriate bracing

【12】B.Low-dose narcotics， NSAIDs， and appropriate bracing

【13】C. Surgical decompression with fusion

【14】D. Further imaging must be obtained， including an MRI to rule out spinal cord injury

【15】E. Reassurance and activity modification

【16】ANSWERS

【17】27.1 A. Lumbar burst fractures are considered unstable and indicate surgical stabi-lization if they involve all 3 columns， result in >40% to 50% loss of height or >30 degrees of kyphosis， or have >40% canal compromise. Burst fractures by definition are not exclusive to the posterior elements.

【18】27.2 D. Although there are details suggesting that this patient’s burst fracture may be stable (ie， only 40% retropulsion and only 30% loss of height)， her progres-sive neurologic symptoms are indication for surgical intervention. E is incor-rect because it does not address the fracture or provide stabilization， as would an anterior decompression and fusion. Local epidural steroids do not address the fracture. ⅣV steroids are controversial； however， they are not indicated greater than 8 hours from injury.

【19】27.3  B. This patient has a stable burst fracture involving only the anterior and middle columns without significant loss of height or angulation. The appropriate treat-ment is pain control (narcotics are appropriate given his acute painful injury) and brace immobilization. Because the injury is stable and because he has no neurologic disruption， he does not necessarily need surgical stabilization， nor does he need extensive， expensive imaging such as an MRI. The patient may be reassured and should certainly refrain periodically from rock climbing， but requires a minimum of brace immobilization until the fracture has healed.

【20】CLINICALPEARLS

【21】Patients with injuries secondary to axial-loading mechanisms should be evaluated for additional associated injuries， such as calcaneus fractures and lumbar burst fractures.

【22】A careful physical exam， including testing of the bulbocavernosus reflex， gives valuable information about whether neurologic injury has occurred and whether or not the patient is in spinal shock.

【23】Patients with incomplete neurologic injuries (preservation of motor or sensory function below the level of the injury) should undergo urgent decompression and stabilization of the injury to maximize the likelihood of neurologic improvement or preservation.苏锦恭
