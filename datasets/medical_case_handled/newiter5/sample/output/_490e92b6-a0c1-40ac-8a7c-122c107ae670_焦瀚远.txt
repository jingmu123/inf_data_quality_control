【0】CASE 12: KNEE PAIN FOLLOWING A TRAFFIC ACCIDENT

【1】History

【2】A 70-year-old man was driving his car along a main road when another vehicle pulled  删除换行1 out of a side street and collided with his vehicle. After the impact he complained of pain  删除换行1 in the superior aspect of his right knee. An ambulance came to the scene and took him  删除换行1 to the emergency department.

【3】Examination

【4】This elderly man has a closed injury and swelling in the distal aspect of the femur and  删除换行1 knee. He has some obvious tenderness to palpation around the distal femur. Radiographs  删除换行1 of his injury are shown in Figs 12.1 and 12.2.

【6】Questions

【7】• What is the diagnosis?

【8】• Which radiographs would you request for this injury?

【9】• What are the principles of management of this kind of injury?

【10】ANSWER 12

【11】The diagnosis is a supracondylar femoral fracture. The anteroposterior and lateral X-rays  删除换行1 show multiple fracture lines within the distal femur consistent with a shortened and  删除换行1 displaced fracture. These injuries make up 6 per cent of all femoral fractures. There is  删除换行1 a bimodal distribution of fractures based on age and gender. Most high-energy distal  删除换行1 femur fractures occur in males aged between 15 and 50 years, while most low-energy  删除换行1 fractures occur in osteoporotic women aged 50 or above. The most common high-energy  删除换行1 mechanism of injury is a road traffic accident (RTA), and the most common low-energy  删除换行1 mechanism is a fall.
Depending on the mechanism of injury, radiographic evaluation of distal femur fractures  删除换行1 may include orthogonal plain radiographs of the entire length of the femur to avoid  删除换行1 missing ipsilateral femoral neck or shaft fractures. True knee radiographs are required  删除换行1 to screen for intra-articular extension of fracture lines. If intra-articular extension is  删除换行1 suspected – particularly coronal plane fractures which can be difficult to see on plain  删除换行5 X-rays – a CT scan may be helpful in planning treatment.

【12】In general, however, non-operative treatment does not work well for displaced fractures.
With this patient, operative treatment is indicated. Operative intervention is also indicated in the presence of open fractures and injuries associated with vascular injury. The  删除换行1 aim of surgery is to achieve anatomical reduction of the joint surface with stable fixation,  删除换行1 restoration of limb alignment, and early postoperative movement of the knee joint. This  删除换行1 patient should have an open reduction and internal fixation with a plate and screws.

【13】Multiple options exist for the definitive treatment of distal femur fractures. They include  删除换行1 external fixation (for patients with open fractures and bone loss, vascular injury, associated significant soft-tissue injuries, or extensive comminution), intramedullary nailing  删除换行1 (for fractures with enough intact distal femur to allow for interlocking screw fixation),  删除换行1 and plate osteosynthesis with either open reduction and internal fixation or minimally  删除换行1 invasive plate osteosynthesis. Likewise, multiple plating options are available and include  删除换行1 conventional buttress plates, fixed-angle devices, and locking plates. Locked implants  删除换行1 are typically indicated in patients with osteoporosis, fractures with metaphyseal comminution where the medial cortex cannot be restored, or a short articular segment. Total  删除换行1 knee replacement is effective in elderly patients with articular fractures and significant  删除换行1 osteoporosis, or pre-existing arthritis that is not amenable to open reduction and internal  删除换行1 fixation.

【14】Low-demand elderly patients with non- or minimally displaced fractures can be managed conservatively. The techniques comprise either skeletal traction or initial splinting  删除换行1 and mobilization with limited weight-bearing and eventual progression to either a cast  删除换行1 or functional brace. Radiographs should be obtained at weekly to bi-weekly intervals for  删除换行1 the first 6 weeks to ensure that the fracture reduction is maintained. The patient should  删除换行1 gradually progress to weight-bearing, and joint mobilization should be allowed based on  删除换行1 the clinical and radiographic progression of fracture healing. In general, this fracture can  删除换行1 take a minimum of 3–4 months to unite.删除个例：<u>Orthopaedics</u>
KEY POINTS

【15】• High-energy distal femur fractures occur in males aged between 15 and 50 years. Most  删除换行1 low-energy fractures occur in osteoporotic women over the age of 50 years.

【16】• Shortening of the fracture with varus and extension of the distal articular segment is the  删除换行1 typical deformity.

【17】• Radiographic evaluation of distal femur fractures may include orthogonal plain  删除换行1 radiographs.

【18】• Low-demand elderly patients with non- or minimally displaced fractures can be  删除换行1 managed conservatively.

【19】• The aim of surgery in displaced fractures is to achieve anatomical reduction of the  删除换行1 joint surface with stable fixation, restoration of limb alignment, and early postoperative  删除换行1 movement of the knee joint.删除6：<u>This page intentionally left blank 35</u>
