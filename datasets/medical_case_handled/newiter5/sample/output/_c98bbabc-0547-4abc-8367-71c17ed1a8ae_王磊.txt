An 8‐month‐old infant is admitted to the intensive care unit after complete repair of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF).
增加换行1: History of Present Illness
--------------------------

【4】The infant was diagnosed prenatally with TOF and has been monitored closely since birth. Increasing cyanotic spells, failure to thrive, and worsening right heart failure led to a decision to proceed with surgery at this time.
增加换行1: Past Medical History
--------------------

【5】Born at term and has received all vaccines as well as influenza and palivizumab. Birthweight was 3.2 kg and current weight is 6 kg. She has been breast‐fed primarily with occasional small amounts of rice cereal and fruits. Home medications include vitamin D supplements every day and oral propranolol 5 mg three times daily.
增加换行1: Family History
--------------

【6】No family history of congenital heart disease, arrhythmias, or sudden cardiac death. She has a 3‐year‐old sibling who is healthy.
增加换行1: Current Status
--------------

【7】The infant is admitted to the intensive care unit immediately after complete repair of TOF (i.e. closure of ventricular septal defect, narrowing of the pulmonary valve and right ventricular outflow tract is augmented by a combination of resection of obstructive muscle tissue in the right ventricle and enlargement with a patch). The operative course was uneventful. She is intubated and is on milrinone and epinephrine infusions. Temporary transcutaneous atrial and ventricular pacing wires are wrapped and secure on chest. Initial postoperative laboratory results are shown in Tables 85.1 and 85.2 .

【8】Vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.3°C (99.2°F) rectal, heart rate 144 bpm in sinus rhythm, blood pressure 90/45 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 94% on F i O <sub>2 </sub> 0.6.

【9】Approximately 1 hour after admission, the registered nurse calls you to the bedside because the heart rate is now 188 bpm. Other vital signs include a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), blood pressure 68/35 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 92% on F i O <sub>2 </sub> 0.6 via ventilator circuit. An electrocardiogram (EKG) is recorded and the results are shown in Figure 85.1 .

【10】Answer the following questions using the details provided.

【11】1.  What is your interpretation of the rhythm strip shown in Figure 85.1 ?
2.  What would be your initial interventions and what additional studies would you order?
3.  What additional interventions and medications can be considered if the rhythm does not convert to sinus rhythm spontaneously?Rationale and Evidence‐based Practice Explanation
-------------------------------------------------

【12】### What is your interpretation of the rhythm strip shown in Figure 85.1

【13】This infant is tachycardic with a regular rate. Differential diagnoses prior to detailed review of the rhythm include sinus tachycardia, atrial tachycardia, and junctional ectopic tachycardia.

【14】### What would be your initial interventions and what additional studies would you order?

【15】A 10 mL/kg bolus of normal saline is administered with no change in rhythm but the blood pressure increases to 74/40 mmHg. The magnesium level was low immediately postoperatively (0.8 mEq/L) and a dose of magnesium is administered. A 12‐lead EKG is ordered with findings of narrow‐complex tachycardia, inverted P waves, and ventricular–atrial dissociation These findings are consistent with junctional ectopic tachycardia (JET).

【16】### What additional interventions and medications can be considered if the rhythm does not convert to sinus rhythm spontaneously?

【17】Decreasing body temperature should be treated with acetaminophen and cooling blankets to maintain body temperature at 35.5°C (96°F). Administer amiodarone 5 mg/kg intravenous piggy back (IVPB) over 60 minutes, which can be repeated up to maximum total dose of 15 mg/kg. Reducing the inotropic epinephrine infusion support may be considered as it can contribute to tachycardia and arrhythmias. Consider using pacing wires for overdrive pacing.

【23】JET is a serious and potentially life‐threatening rhythm in the postoperative period after surgery to repair TOF. It can be the result of edema or injury to the tissue surrounding the electrical conducting atrioventricular (AV) node and occurs in up to 10% of children after cardiac surgery. Risk factors include surgeries occurring near the AV node such as TOF and atrioventricular septal defect repair. Electrolyte imbalance, particularly low magnesium levels, can precipitate JET in the postoperative period as can low intravascular volume, fever, or high inotropic support. Successful treatment of JET is difficult and several steps may be needed, including antiarrhythmics, pacing, cooling, and electrolyte replacement in addition to maintaining normal intravascular volume. The use of amiodarone is considered by some to be a first‐line therapy, and when considered it can be done concomitantly with other cooling and replacement strategies. The rhythm, if a result of edema or inflammation, usually converts 24–48 hours after surgery.王磊
