【0】Question: 26.1 A 27-year-old man has been rushed to the emergency department following his sudden collapse and entry into a state of unconsciousness. Examination of personal belongings revealed the patient is an insulin-dependent diabetic. A rapid decline in which of the following humoral factors likely triggered the sudden collapse of the patient?

【1】A. Insulin

【2】B. Glucagon

【3】C. Fatty acids

【4】D. Glucose

【5】E. Triglyceride

【6】Answer: 26.1 D . Glucose is the primary source of energy for the central nervous system. A sudden decrease in circulating glucose levels will therefore impair ATP generation, in turn impeding cognitive function. If hypoglycemia persists, then the patient will slip into a coma and eventually die. This unfortunately common complication in people with type 1 diabetes is a consequence of oversupplementation with insulin. By contrast, a sudden decrease in circulating insulin, glucagon, fatty acids, or triglyceride would have little immediate effect on cognitive function.

【7】Question: 26.2 Which of the following is the least likely to contribute to the hyperglycemia associated with uncontrolled type 1 diabetes?

【8】A. Decreased skeletal muscle glucose uptake

【9】B. Decreased adipose lipogenesis

【10】C. Increased adipose lipolysis

【11】D. Increased hepatic gluconeogenesis

【12】E. Increased skeletal muscle glycogenolysis

【13】Answer: 26.2 E . Unlike the liver, skeletal muscle cannot export glucose into the circulation. Once glucose enters the myocyte, it is destined for use by that cell. Thus, intramyocellular glycogen is used as a fuel source by skeletal muscle and therefore cannot contribute to the hyperglycemia observed in uncontrolled type I diabetes. In contrast decreased insulin-mediated glucose utilization by skeletal muscle and adipose will contribute to hyperglycemia, as will decreased insulin-mediated suppression of hepatic glucose output. Decreased insulin-mediated suppression of lipolysis will indirectly contribute to hyperglycemia, by providing alterative, nonglucose fuels (fatty acids and ketone bodies) for organs such as skeletal muscle and the liver.

【14】Question: 26.3 Which of the following changes in hepatic metabolism best explains the increased incidence of ketoacidosis observed in type 1 diabetes?

【15】A. Increased glucose uptake

【16】B. Increased protein synthesis

【17】C. Increased lipoprotein synthesis

【18】D. Increased β-oxidation

【19】E. Increased glycogen breakdown
Answer: 26.3 D . Decreased circulating insulin signals a need to increase hepatic glucose production. This is an energetically demanding process, driven by β-oxidation of fatty acids. However, acetyl-CoA, the major end product of β-oxidation, cannot be used for glucose production. Instead, acetyl-CoA is shunted into the pathway of ketone body synthesis (ketogenesis). By contrast, carbon from intrahepatic glycogen will contribute less to ketone body synthesis in uncontrolled type 1 diabetes mellitus. Net glucose uptake, protein synthesis, and lipoprotein synthesis are decreased, as opposed to increased, during uncontrolled type 1 diabetes.

【20】BIOCHEMISTRY PEARLS

【21】 The liver uses 2 mechanisms for endogenous glucose production, the mobilization of intracellular glycogen (glycogenolysis) and the synthesis of glucose from noncarbohydrate precursors (gluconeogenesis).

【22】 Flux of carbon through the pathways of hepatic glucose metabolism described above is strongly influenced by the hormones insulin, glucagon, and epinephrine.

【23】 Lack of insulin, in the face of elevated glucagon and epinephrine, leads to high rates of hepatic glucose output, driven by β-oxidation of fatty acids. The latter results in an excessive production of ketone bodies and subsequent ketoacidosis.王磊
