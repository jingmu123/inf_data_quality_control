【0】Question: 54.1 A 32-year-old female G1P1001 presents to address problems with her combination OCP. She has noticed increased breakthrough bleeding and spotting over the past few months. She is still having regular menses and denies any other complaints and is happy with the type of contraception. Which of the following would be your next step?

【1】A. Provide drug-free period for 1–2 months

【2】B. Switch to progestin-only pill

【3】C. Increase the progesterone component of the combination OCP

【4】D. Increase the estrogen component

【5】Answer: 54.1 D. As the patient is happy with the type of contraceptive, the preference should not be to change to a difference modality. Simply increasing the estrogen component will typically help reduce the irregularity and intermenstrual bleeding.

【6】Question: 54.2 A 37-year-old morbidly obese female G6P6006 who is married, monogamous, presents to address contraceptive options. At present she does not desire fertility for several years. She has no past medical or surgical history, but does smoke two packs per day. Which of the following options would be least preferred in this patient?

【7】A. Ortho Evra transdermal patch

【8】B. Mirena IUD

【9】C. Depo-Provera injection

【10】D. Progestin-only pill

【11】Answer: 54.2 A. Obese patients over 198 pounds typically have much less success with the Ortho Evra patch. In addition as the patient is over the age of 35 and a heavy smoker (over 15 cigarettes daily), it would be prudent to avoid any contraceptive containing estrogen to diminish the cardiovascular and VTE risks. All of the other choices would provide adequate contraception without the above risks as they are all progesterone-only options. As the patient desires contraception for several years, the Mirena IUD would be ideal in this patient.

【12】Question: 54.3 A 24-year-old nulliparous female with no past medical history presents to discuss contraception. She has a history of acne and painful menses since menarche. She has regular menses now and uses condoms for STI prevention. The patient’s biggest concern is not to have unexpected spotting, intermenstrual bleeding, or irregularity of her cycles as this would negatively affect her sex life. Which of the following options would be best for this patient?

【13】A. Progestin-only pill

【14】B. Implanon intradermal implant

【15】C. Mirena IUD

【16】D. Combination monophasic OCP
Answer: 54.3 D. Acne and dysmenorrhea (painful menses) can be improved with combination OCPs. The progesterone-only options (which include choices a–c) could worsen acne and have a much higher risk of irregular menses, intermenstrual bleeding, and spotting. In addition, they are less effective for dysmenorrhea than the combination OCPs. Monophasic combination OCPs are generally better than biphasic or triphasic combination OCPs in regulating menses.

【17】PHARMACOLOGY PEARLS

【18】 Progesterone-only contraceptives offer the advantage of not increasing VTE or cardiovascular risks compared to combination estrogen/progesterone agents.

【19】 Combination estrogen/progesterone products help with acne, dysmenorrhea, as well as menstrual irregularities, and have been associated with a decrease in ovarian and endometrial cancers.

【20】 Contraceptive choice should be based on patient preference, risk of comorbidities, desired duration of contraception, cost, and avoidance of contraindications.

【21】 LARC agents have higher typical use efficacy than the other agents due to decreased need for daily patient compliance.
