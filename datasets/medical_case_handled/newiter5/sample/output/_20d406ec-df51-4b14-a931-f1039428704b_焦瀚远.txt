【11】Case Presentation
-----------------

【12】A 36-year-old Latina female presents for evaluation of brown spots on her left and right upper cheekbones. She began to notice brown spots on her cheeks a year ago but they have recently started to form into patches. The brown patches are not painful and do not itch, but they are not cosmetically appealing and have caused severe distress. She has a history of birth control pill use during her twenties and has two children. She noticed the brown spots worsening during pregnancy. She wears a moisturizer daily, but does not wear sunscreen. She is an avid gardener.

【13】Physican Examination
--------------------

【14】There are scattered, hyperpigmented macules coalescing into reticular patches on her forehead, cheeks, nose, and upper lip 删除33：<u></u>.

【17】Differential Diagnosis
----------------------

【18】The patient’s clinical presentation was most consistent with melasma. Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation may present with brown macules and associated erythema, scale, and pruritus secondary to photosensitivity reactions or irritant contact dermatitis. Solar lentigines are secondary to ultraviolet radiation and present as round, flat, well-circumscribed macules in sun exposed sites. Drug-induced photosensitivity due to thiazides or tetracyclines may present as irregularly shaped hyperpigmentation. Actinic lichen planus often presents on the temples and may involve the neck and intertriginous sites. Exogenous ochronosis presents with hyperpigmentation followed by progressive darkening with superimposed pigmented papules. Acquired bilateral nevus of Ota-like macules (Hori’s nevi) presents with multiple brown to gray to blue macules, primarily on the malar region. It is usually more common in Asian females 删除10：<u>(Chung 2008 )</u>.

【19】Wood’s Lamp Examination
-----------------------

【20】Wood’s lamp examination (365 nm) shows accentuation or darkening of the hyperpigmented patches.

【21】Histopathology
--------------

【22】Melasma is typically a clinical diagnosis; however, if a biopsy were performed, pathology would show epidermal melanin in basal and suprabasal keratinocytes. The number of melanocytes is not increased; however, the melanocytes that are present are larger, more dendritic, and more active. Inflammation is typically absent 删除10：<u>(Chung 2008 )</u>.

【23】Diagnosis

【25】Case Treatment
--------------

【26】The likely etiology of melasma, including her oral contraceptive usage, pregnancy, and sun exposure was discussed. A triple combination compound consisting of hydroquinone 6 % + tretinoin 0.025 % + fluocinolone 0.01 % cream was started every other night to the dark areas only. The patient was recommended to increase the cream to nightly after 1 week if she had no burning or irritation. A broad spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 was recommended daily. Daily use of Polypodium leucotomos was recommended as a supplement. A 3 month follow-up was recommended. After mild improvement was seen, she was started on a series of three 35 % glycolic acid peels every 4 weeks in addition to her topical regimen.

【27】Discussion
----------

【28】Melasma is a common acquired disorder of hyperpigmentation that is found mostly in Latina, Southeast Asian, and African American women with Fitzpatrick skin types III-V. Women are more prone to developing the disease than men, especially after the woman has experienced childbirth—leading to the common term, “the mask of pregnancy.” Melasma is worsened by excess exposure to the sun; therefore, it is more common in those living in areas with intense ultraviolet radiation exposure 删除10：<u>(Sheth and Pandya 2011a )</u>. A recent multicenter survey from nine countries found that 41 % of women had onset of the disorder after pregnancy but before menopause. Only 8 % noted spontaneous remission, and 25 % had onset after starting their contraceptive 删除10：<u>(Ortonne et al. 2009 )</u>.

【29】The exact cause of melasma is unknown. The high incidence among family members suggest a genetic component, and various surveys from around the world report 10–70 % of family members being involved 删除10：<u>(Ortonne et al. 2009 )</u>. Sun exposure is likely an exacerbating factor because of the ultraviolet induced upregulation of melanocyte proliferation, migration, and melanogenesis 删除10：<u>(Sheth and Pandya 2011a )</u>. While melasma is known to occur with hormonal changes, clinical evidence to date does not clearly associate serum hormone levels to melasma. Perez et al examined the link between circulating hormones and found that nulligravid women with melasma had significantly higher serum levels of luteinizing hormone and lower levels of estradiol than their counterpart controls, though further research is needed 删除10：<u>(Perez et al. 1983 )</u>. Several studies have noted the onset of melasma with oral contraceptive use and pregnancy. Therefore, it is recommended that patients who develop melasma while taking an oral contraceptive should stop the medication and avoid future use of such drugs when possible 删除10：<u>(Sheth and Pandya 2011a )</u>. However, stopping the culprit oral contraceptive will not necessarily reverse melasma. Some studies have suggested that mild abnormalities in thyroid function are associated with oral contraceptive or pregnancy related melasma; therefore, it is reasonable to consider checking thyroid function tests in melasma patients 删除10：<u>(Lutfi et al. 1985 )</u>.

【30】Melasma presents as symmetrically distributed hyperpigmented macules that coalesce into reticular patches. There are three distribution patterns. Centrofacial melasma, the most common pattern, involves the forehead, cheeks, upper lip, nose, and chin 删除33：<u></u>. The malar pattern is limited to the cheeks and the nose 删除33：<u></u>, and the mandibular pattern is specific to the jawline. Histologically, melasma may be divided into three subtypes. In epidermal melasma, melanin is increased in the epidermis, and patients present with tan to brown hyperpigmentation. In dermal melasma, melanin is found in superficial and mid dermal macrophages, which often congregate around small, dilated vessels, and patients present with a bluish discoloration 删除33：<u></u>. Dermal melasma is typically harder to treat. In mixed melasma, melanin is found in both the epidermis and the dermis. In most cases, the number of melanocytes is not increased, yet the melanocytes that are present are larger, more dendritic, and more active. Inflammation is sparse or absent 删除10：<u>(Kang et al. 2002 )</u>.

【35】The excess melanin can be visually localized to the epidermis or the dermis by use of a Wood’s lamp. Epidermal pigment is enhanced during examination with a Wood’s light, whereas, dermal pigment is not. Lesions that have both enhancing and nonenhancing areas have a mixed pattern.

【36】Treatment
---------

【37】Melasma is often difficult to treat and has a significant negative impact on patients’ quality of life. The ultimate goal of melasma management is to lighten the affected area enough so that it is even with the rest of the skin. This can be difficult when treating patients with skin of color.

【38】First line therapy involves topical compounds that affect the pigment production pathway. Topical hydroquinone is the most common topical treatment used for melasma. Hydroquinone is a tyrosinase inhibitor, which primarily leads to decreased melanin production, along with altered melanosome formation and increased melanosome destruction 删除10：<u>(Jimbow et al. 1974 )</u>. Ennes et al found that 38 % of patients treated with 4 % hydroquinone cream once daily for 12 weeks had a complete clinical response compared to only 8 % in the placebo group 删除10：<u>(Ennes et al. 2000 )</u>. There is some controversy over the use of hydroquinone. Although rare in the United States, there have been several reports of exogenous ochronosis, a bluish-gray discoloration, after the use of hydroquinone cream, especially in South African blacks 删除10：<u>(Sheth and Pandya 2011b )</u>. One explanation for the high incidence in South Africans is that patients outside of the United States have uncontrolled access to over the counter high concentrations of hydroquinone 删除10：<u>(Olumide et al. 2008 )</u>, often mixed with topical steroids, and used for long periods of time

【39】Topical tretinoin cream is also an effective treatment, but often causes irritation and usually requires months to show improvement as monotherapy. The combination of hydroquinone, a retinoid, and a topical steroid appear to be highly effective for the treatment of melasma, with the Kligman-Willis Formula – 5 % hydroquinone, 0.1 % tretinoin, 0.1 % dexamethasone, and a hydrophilic ointment being the originally studied combination 删除10：<u>(Kligman and Willis 1975 )</u>. The theory behind the effectiveness is that tretinoin prevents the oxidation of hydroquinone and improves epidermal penetration while the steroid reduces the irritation side effect of both. Side effects include erythema, desquamation, burning, and pruritus. Because irritation may lead to post inflammatory hyperpigmentation in patients with darker skin types, there are other topical agents that are available. These include azelaic acid, kojic acid, and ascorbic acid (vitamin C), all which may be less efficacious than hydroquinone but typically have less irritation.

【40】Because ultraviolet and visible light can induce melanin formation, regular use of a broad spectrum sunscreen is effective both in preventing melasma and in enhancing the efficacy of other topical therapies once melasma has developed. It is recommended that all patients with melasma use a UVA and UVB protective sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 preferentially with a physical blocker, such as titanium dioxide or zinc oxide. Patients should also wear wide brimmed hats and protective clothing when outdoors. Many patients also use camouflage make-ups, with the most common brands being Dermablend (Vichy Laboratories, Paris, France), Covermark/CM Beauty (CM Beauty, Northvale, NJ), and Cover FX (Cover FX, Skin Care, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) 删除10：<u>(Sheth and Pandya 2011b )</u>.

【41】Chemical peels can also improve melasma by removing unwanted melanin. However, they must be used with caution in skin of color, as they can cause irritation which can lead to postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. Glycolic acid peels are alpha hydroxyl acids that lead to epidermal remodeling, accelerated desquamation and pigment dispersion, along with inhibition of tyrosinase. When used in combination with a modified Kligman-Willis formula (5 % hydroquinone + 0.05 % tretinoin + 1 % hydrocortisone acetate), there was a decrease in the melasma area and severity index (MASI) by 79.9 % 删除10：<u>(Sarkar et al. 2002 )</u>. Salicylic acid peels, which are beta hydroxyl acids, have also been used for melasma, especially in Fitzpatrick skin types V and VI 删除10：<u>(Grimes 1999 )</u>.

【42】The use of lasers have inconsistent results and is challenging because damage to surrounding tissue and subsequent inflammation can lead to postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. Fractional resurfacing is the only laser approved by the FDA for treatment of melasma. The microthermal zones of injury limit the area of skin that is damaged with each treatment, which may decrease the risk of postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. Studies have been limited to Fitzpatrick skin types III-IV 删除10：<u>(Rokhsar and Fitzpatrick 2005 ; Goldberg et al. 2008 )</u>. Q-switched Nd:YAG lasers appear to have an increased risk of hyperpigmentation and a very high rate of relapse following treatment. Intense pulsed light therapy has been shown to be effective in improving melasma but is also characterized by a high relapse rate. In general, laser and light therapies show the best response in lighter-skinned individuals and should be used very carefully, particularly in dark-skinned patients 删除10：<u>(Rivas and Pandya 2013 )</u>. The use of lasers for melasma should be restricted to cases unresponsive to topical therapy or chemical peels. Appropriate maintenance therapy should be selected to avoid relapse 删除10：<u>(Arora et al. 2012 )</u>.

【43】Recently, orally administered Polypodium leucotomos has been shown to be beneficial for the prevention and potential treatment of several aesthetically relevant conditions, including melasma, due to the presence of its antioxidant and photoprotective properties. In a randomized, placebo-controlled study by Ahmed et al, the oral administration of Polypodium leucotomos as an adjunct to sunscreen improved the severity of melasma in women after 12 weeks. No adverse events have been associated with the use of Polypodium leucotomos. Therefore, Polypodium leucotomos appears to provide adjunctive benefits in treating melasma; however, more data with larger sample sizes are needed 删除10：<u>(Ahmed et al. 2013 )</u>.
