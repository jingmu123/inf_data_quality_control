【0】CASE 48: A SEATBELT INJURY

【1】History

【2】A 33-year-old man was a passenger of car involved in a head-on collision travelling at  删除换行1 60 mph (97 km/h). He is brought into the accident and emergency department as a trauma  删除换行1 call. He was sitting in the rear of the car in the central passenger seat restrained by an  删除换行1 old-style ‘lap belt’, unlike the other passengers who were wearing standard shoulder and  删除换行1 lap belts. He was thrown forward into the seat in front. He was conscious throughout but  删除换行1 is complaining of severe pain in the lower thoracic and lumbar spine.

【3】Examination

【4】Primary survey is unremarkable and his observations are stable. There is marked tenderness over the lower thoracic and lumbar spine. On neurological examination of the  删除换行1 lower limbs there are no motor or sensory abnormalities. Per rectal examination revealed  删除换行1 normal tone. A computed tomography (CT) examination of the thorax and abdomen was  删除换行1 obtained with sagittal 删除33：<u></u> and coronal 删除33：<u></u> reformats.

【5】Question

【6】• What abnormality do the CT images  删除换行1 show?

【7】删除3：<u>Figure 48.1 CT scans: (a,b) sagittal and (c) 删除换行1 coronal views.</u>
 ANSWER 48

【8】The sagittal 删除33：<u></u> and coronal 删除33：<u></u> reformats of the spine show a  删除换行1 ‘Chance’ fracture line extending through the spinous process, lamina, pedicles and vertebral body of T9 (a horizontal splitting of the vertebra beginning with the spinous process  删除换行1 or lamina and extending anteriorly through the pedicles and vertebral body).

【9】Chance fracture is caused by a flexion injury of the spine, first described by G.Q. Chance  删除换行1 in 1948. It consists of a compression injury to the anterior portion of the vertebral body  删除换行1 and a transverse fracture through the posterior elements of the vertebra and the posterior  删除换行1 portion of the vertebral body. It is caused by violent forward flexion, causing distraction  删除换行1 injury to the posterior elements.
Chance fractures later became known as ‘seatbelt’ fractures with the advent of lap seatbelts in cars. A head-on collision would cause the passenger wearing a lap belt to suddenly be flexed at the waist, hence creating significant stress on the posterior elements of  删除换行1 the vertebra. From the 1980s when shoulder and lap belts became more common in cars  删除换行5 Chance fractures have become less associated with road traffic accidents and are more  删除换行1 commonly seen with falls or crush-type injuries where the thorax is acutely hyperflexed.

【10】The most common site at which Chance fractures occur is the thoracolumbar junction and  删除换行1 mid-lumbar region in paediatric populations.

【11】An anterior–posterior (AP) view of the spine may reveal disruption of the pedicles and  删除换行1 loss of vertebral body height. Frequently a transverse process fracture will be identified  删除换行1 on AP projection. The lateral view will demonstrate the spinous process fracture and fractures through the laminae and pedicles. The vertebral body will usually look compressed  删除换行1 and wedge shaped.

【12】CT of the spine should be performed on all Chance fractures to assess the extent of the  删除换行1 fracture and to evaluate the spinal canal. Sagittal reconstructions of the axial images  删除换行1 provide a great deal of information about the fracture pattern. Posterior element fractures  删除换行1 are better seen on lateral projection, although the AP view helps to demonstrate pedicle  删除换行1 involvement.
Up to 50 per cent of Chance fractures have associated intra-abdominal injuries, including fractures of the pancreas, contusions or lacerations of the duodenum and mesenteric  删除换行1 contusions or lacerations.

【13】 KEY POINTS

【14】• The incidence of associated intra-abdominal injuries with a Chance fracture reaches  删除换行1 50 per cent. Therefore, when a Chance fracture is diagnosed a CT of the abdomen  删除换行1 should be obtained.

【15】• Injuries associated with Chance fractures include fractures of the pancreas, duodenum  删除换行1 and mesentery contusions/rupture.苏锦恭
