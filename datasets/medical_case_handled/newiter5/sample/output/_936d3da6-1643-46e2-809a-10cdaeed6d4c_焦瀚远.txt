【0】Question: A 3-year-old boy is brought to the pediatrician because of decreased vision and pain in his right eye. Past medical history is significant for the diagnosis of glaucoma shortly after birth that has been refractory to standard medical therapies. Focused physical examination reveals iris hamartomas. Which of the following additional signs is most likely on physical examination?

【1】> (A) Bilateral acoustic neuromas

【2】> (B) Bilateral renal cell carcinomas

【3】> (C) Cystic medial necrosis of the aorta

【4】> (D) Leptomeningeal angioma

【5】> (E) Scoliosis

【6】 Answer: The correct answer is E. This patient demonstrates several characteristics classic for neurofibromatosis type 1 (also known as von Recklinghausen disease). Potential findings include café au lait spots, two or more neurofibromas, optic glioma, iris hamartomas (Lisch nodules), a positive family history (autosomal dominant inheritance), and a distinctive bony lesion such as sphenoid dysplasia or scoliosis. Patients with this disease generally demonstrate 95% of the criteria by age 8 years and all of the criteria by age 20. These patients are also at increased risk for tumors. The gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 17.  
Answer A is incorrect. Bilateral acoustic neuromas are characteristic of neurofibromatosis type 2. It is much less common than type 1 and typically manifests with multiple central nervous system tumors. The NF 2 gene is located on chromosome 22.  
Answer B is incorrect. Bilateral renal cell carcinoma occurs in von Hippel-Lindau disease, an autosomal dominant disease that is characterized by hemangioblastomas of the retina, cerebellum, and medulla. About half of patients develop bilateral renal cell carcinomas. The disease is associated with the deletion of the VHL gene located on chromosome 3, which is a tumor suppressor gene.  
Answer C is incorrect. Cystic medial necrosis of the aorta leading to aortic insufficiency and dissecting aortic aneurysm is associated with Marfan syndrome, a connective tissue disorder caused by the autosomal dominant inheritance of a defective fibrillin gene.  
Answer D is incorrect. Leptomeningeal angioma is associated with Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS), which is a rare congenital vascular disorder of unknown etiology affecting capillary-sized blood vessels. Its characteristic features include angiomas and a facial port-wine stain. Only a small portion of patients with port-wine stains at birth have SWS.焦瀚远
