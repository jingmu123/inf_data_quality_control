【0】41.1 A 20-year-old man is shot in the right upper quadrant of his abdomen. On admission to the trauma bay， the paramedics inform you that he has 2 large bore IVs and has been given 2 L of normal saline en route to the hospital. His airway is patent， he is breathing spontaneously with oxygen saturations of 99%on 2 L/min by nasal cannula. His blood pressure is 80/40 mm Hg and his heart rate is 120 beats/minute. He has a missile wound to the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. His abdomen is very tender and he is cold and diaphoretic. The best next step in treatment for this patient is：

【1】AAdminister 500 mL of 5% albumin.BC

【2】Administer 2 L of lactated Ringer solution.

【3】Give 2 U of type-specific blood.

【4】D.(Give 2 U of non-type-specific blood (O negative).

【5】E. Warm the patient and send for coagulation labs.

【6】41.2 A 37-year-old woman is brought in by paramedics after sustaining a severe crush injury of her right lower extremity. She is taken to the operation room(OR) where her lower extremity is explored， washed out， has an external fixa-tion device placed， and a wound vacuum device placed over the open wound. The surgery takes several hours， and she is admitted to the ICU after the sur-gery. Her wound vacuum output is 1.5 L of frank blood over the next 4 hours. She received 2 U of PRBCs during the surgery and has received 3 more units since arriving in the ICU， and 1 more unit is being transfused now. Her heart rate is 120 beats/minute and her blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Her current hemoglobin concentration is 7 g/dL and platelet count is 475，000. Her INR is 1.9. Her temperature is 35℃. The best next step in management of this patient is：

【7】ATransfuse platelets.BC

【8】Transfuse FFP and recheck INR in 2 hours.

【9】Take patient to OR for continued bleed from wound.

【10】D.IDecrease the wound vacuum suction.

【11】E.Transfuse 2 more units of blood and recheck hemoglobin.

【12】41.3 A patient is undergoing a massive transfusion during an operation for a Grade IV liver laceration. He has received 9 U of PRBCs and 8 U of FFP The best next step in treating this patient is：

【13】A4 more units of PRBCsBC

【14】2 L of crystalloid 删除换行1 1 U of plateletpheresis

【15】D. 6 U of plateletpheresis

【16】E. 1 U of cryoprecipitate

【17】41.4 A 63-year-old woman is undergoing colectomy for severe diverticulitis. During the operation， there is a significant amount of bleeding from an unidentified mesenteric vessel. The surgeons have stated that they are having difficulty getting control of the vessel and have called for a vascular surgeon. While the surgeons are working to get surgical control of the bleeding， she has been transfused 6 U of PRBCs in the last hour. She is still bleeding and intermit-tently hypotensive. The next step in management is：

【18】A. Continue to transfuse red blood cells based on whether she is still hypotensive.

【19】B.Continue to work on surgical control of bleeding and begin a massive transfusion protocol.

【20】C. Check her INR and transfuse FFP only if INR >2.0.

【21】D. Administer rFVII and normal saline intravenously

【22】ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS

【23】41.1 D. This patient has a gunshot wound to the right upper quadrant and is hypotensive and tachycardic. His appearance is consistent with high grade of shock. He is breathing and has normal saturations， so it is unlikely that he has an injury to his chest. His abdomen is tender and he most likely has blood in his abdomen. In this patient who has already received 2 L of normal saline before reaching the hospital and is still hypotensive， it is appropriate to start giving the patient blood. In the initial trauma setting， it is inappropriate to wait for type-specific blood. The first blood transfusions should be non-type and crossed blood (Type O). A sample of the patient’s blood should be sent for analysis so that future transfusions can be cross-matched. While it is important to start warming the patient as soon as possible， immediate resuscitation with blood and blood products predicates the warming and evaluation of coagula-tion status.

【24】41.2 C. This patient suffered a significant injury to her lower extremity that required an operation， fixation device， and wound vacuum placed over her open wound. After being admitted to the ICU， she continues to have several problems. Her bleeding has not stopped， she has low blood concentrations，her coagulation has elevated， and she is cold. The most concerning aspect of this patient is her continued bleeding as noted by the high output of blood in her wound vacuum. When faced with a patient who does not respond appropri-ately to resuscitation， it is important to consider that the cause is inadequate“source control.”In this case the acute surgical bleeding must be stopped so that she can be adequately resuscitated. It is likely that she will need more blood， FFP， and possibly platelets while the bleeding is being controlled， but the first step is to control surgical bleeding.

【25】41.3 C. During a massive transfusion， the goal is to achieve a hemostatic resus-citation. Although this is best achieved in a 1：1：1 ratio of blood products. One pack of plateletpheresis equal to 6 to 10 packs of pooled platelet packs. Thus， after 6 to 8 U of PRBCs and FFP are given， 1 U of platelets should be administered.

【26】41.4 B. This patient has required 6 U of PRBCs in the last hour and there is antici-pation that the she will have ongoing transfusion requirements. This meets the definition of a dynamic massive transfusion needs. While the surgeons are gaining surgical control of the bleeding， a massive transfusion should begin so that hemostatic resuscitation can be started to decrease the probability that the patient will become coagulopathic.

【27】CLINICAL PEARLS

【28】UUpto one-third ofall trauma patients who arrive tothe emergency depart-ment are already coagulopathic.

【29】The “triad of death” is the presence of coagulopathy， acidosis， and hypo-thermia. Each of these detrimental conditions exacerbates the other and should be preempted by active warming of the patient and the use of hemostatic resuscitation.

【30】The current recommendation for massive transfusions is that it should be done in a 1：1：1 ratio of PRBCs：FFP：platelets.

【31】The standard coagulation laboratory studies lag behind in severely injured trauma patients undergoing massive transfusions. TEG or ROTEM anal-ysis is likely a better representation of the patient's actual coagulation status.

【32】One unit ofsingle pool plateletpheresis is equivalent to 6-10 units ofran-domly donated platelets and is given for every 6 units of packed RBC in the massive transfusion protocol.黄艳玲
