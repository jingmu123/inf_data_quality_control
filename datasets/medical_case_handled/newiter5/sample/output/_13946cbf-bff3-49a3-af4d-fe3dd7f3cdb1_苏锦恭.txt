【0】CASE 18

【1】A 17-year-old boy is awakened from his sleep by sudden， sharp scrotal pain. In the emergency department， negative cremasteric reflex on the left. No transillumination of the scrotum is present.

| A 17-year-old boy is awakened from his sleep by sudden， sharp scrotal pain. In the emergency department，the patient says he feels nauseous. He reports that the pain is mainly on the left side. On physicalexamination， he is afebrile， and there is evidence of swelling and reddening of the scrotum. He has anegative cremasteric reflex on the left. No transillumination of the scrotum is present.  |

| What is the most likely diagnosis? Testicular torsion. Testicular torsion is usually seen in adolescent males aged 16-18 years， although it canalso occur in infancy. Approximately 50% of instances occur during sleep， but it can also occur at rest orwith physical activity. Some patients have repeated episodes that spontaneously resolve (presumablybecause the testis is undergoing repeated torsion and detorsion).  |
| What signs and symptoms are typically associated with this condition? Symptoms of testicular torsion include the following： ·Sudden， acute onset of pain in the scrotum， often on one side. ·Swelling/reddening of the scrotum. · Abdominal pain. ·Nausea/vomiting. Signs of testicular torsion include the affected side's being higher than the other and horizontal inorientation as well as absent cremasteric reflex.  |
| What conditions should be included in the differential diagnosis?·Epididymitis should be considered but is not likely here given that signs of systemic infection (eg，fever) are not present nor is there epididymal tenderness or induration. Likewise， no history of sexuallytransmitted disease risk is noted. Notably， if scrotal elevation had relieved pain (Prehn sign)， this wouldhave indicated epididymitis in lieu of torsion. ·Orchitis should be considered but is also not likely in this patient given the lack of fever， lack of bilateraltesticular involvement， and lack of other signs of mumps.TTrauma should be considered but is not likely here given the lack of history consistent with this etiology.·Hydrocele should be considered but again is not likely here because hydroceles rarely present withacute scrotal pain at night； however， when they are reactive hydroceles trom other etiologies， pain maybe present. Additionally， transillumination would be noted on exam. ·Varicocele should be considered but is unlikely in this case because the "bag of worms" sign would benoted on exam of the scrotum. ·Hernia should be considered but is also unlikely given that no mass was appreciated on exam.·TTumor should be considered last， but is unlikely because no mass was noted on exam.  |
| What complications are associated with this condition? Testicular torsion results in the twisting of the spermatic cord， which contains the testicular artery，pampiniform plexus， and vas deferens. The main danger is the twisting of the testicular artery， which cutsoff the blood supply to the testicle. If this is not reversed rapidly， it will result in testicular atrophy andnecrosis. This is a true surgical emergency.  |
| What is the appropriate treatment for this condition?Manually untwisting the testis will produce immediate and dramatic pain relief if successful. The successof this method can be confirmed by evidence of return of blood flow to the testis on Doppler ultrasound.Even it successful， surgery should be performed to suture the testis in place to prevent repeated torsion.If manual detorsion does not work， emergent surgery must be performed. Treatment must be initiatedwithin 6 hours of presentation to assure viability of the testicle. If it is not treated within 24 hours， there islittle chance of the testicle's viability.  |
