【2】B. Bone scan

【3】C. Chest x-TaV

【4】D.AP clavicle including Zanca views

【5】E.Shoulder x-rays

【6】11.2 A 17-year-old high school tennis player trips while returning a serve and sus-tains a right midshaft clavicle fracture. Which of the following increases the risk of nonunion in the nonoperative treatment of clavicle fractures?

【7】A.Sling treatment

【8】B.Figure-of-eight bandage treatment

【9】C.Displacement and comminution

【10】D.Male sex

【11】E.Age <20 years

【12】11.3A 53-year-old intoxicated man crashes his motorcycle into a pole. In the emergency department， he is hemodynamically stable and complains of right shoulder pain. Radiographs of the affected site are seen in Figure 11-2. Which classification best describes his injury?

【16】D. Allman group I， type II B

【17】ANSWERS

【18】11.1 D. The best initial imaging choice to evaluate clavicle fractures is an AP view of the clavicle with Zanca views to further evaluate distal clavicle fracture battern.

【19】11.2 C. Displacement and comminution have been shown to increase risk of non-union in nonoperative management. There are no significant differences between outcomes when using sling immobilization versus a figure-of-eight bandage.

【20】11.3B. This is a right distal clavicle fracture (group II) with coracoclavicular liga-ments intact (type I)： an Allman group II， (Neer) type I. Allman group I and III fractures describe the middle and proximal clavicle， respectively， and do not apply to this distal clavicle injury. Because the injury is medial to both coracoclavicular ligaments， they are intact， and thus it is a type I and not type II group II injury.

【21】CLINICALPEARLS

【22】The clavicle is distinct in being the first bone in the body to ossify (fifth week in utero) and the last to fuse its ossification center (22-25 years).

【23】Clavicle fractures occur in both low- and high-energy settings.

【24】The vast majority of clavicle fractures may be managed nonoperatively in a sling or figure-of-eight bandage.苏锦恭
