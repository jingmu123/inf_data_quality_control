【0】Question: A 21-year-old woman presents to her male family practitioner complaining of sleep deprivation and severe depression. When asked about her sleeping habits in greater depth, she reports sleeping for seven-nine hours per night, but states that it is “just not right.” In addition, she later claims to not have any problems with her personal life and is happy and excited about her recent promotion. Throughout the course of the visit, the patient becomes progressively more animated and begins making aggressive sexual advances toward the physician and the staff. She reports that her mood has been good, but not overly elevated, expansive, or elated. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

【1】> (A) Bipolar disorder type I

【2】> (B) Histrionic personality disorder

【3】> (C) Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder

【4】> (D) Paranoid personality disorder

【5】> (E) Schizotypal personality disorder

【6】 Answer: The correct answer is B. Histrionic personality disorder is one of the cluster B personality disorders (the “wild” group) that presents early in adulthood. It is best characterized as a pattern of excessive emotionality and attention seeking, and it is often accompanied by somatoform disorders (somatization is a process by which an individual uses his or her body or symptoms for a range of psychologic purposes and gains). An especially important characteristic to remember about histrionic personality disorder is the often overtly sexual nature of those affected. Relationships with physicians in particular are affected by the patient’s attention-seeking behavior, as is evident in this case by the patient reporting both sleep deprivation and depression without objective signs of either.  
Answer A is incorrect. Type 1 bipolar disorder is characterized by manic episodes (periods of elevated or irritable mood that must last at least one week) as well as depressive syndromes and mixed syndromes. Sleep of seven-nine hours per night is not usually consistent with a manic syndrome.  
Answer C is incorrect. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is characterized by an excessive preoccupation with control, order, and perfectionism. This patient presents none of these characteristics.  
Answer D is incorrect. Paranoid personality disorder is characterized by the inherent belief that the world is a dangerous and threatening place. Upon meeting these individuals they often project strength and capability, and their distrust and suspiciousness of everyone is evident. These individuals tend to believe in various conspiracy theories.  
Answer E is incorrect. Schizotypal personality disorder is characterized by interpersonal awkwardness, odd beliefs or magical thinking, and an eccentric appearance.焦瀚远
