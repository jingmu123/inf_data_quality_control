【0】CASE 81: SUSPECTED OPIATE OVERDOSE

【1】History

【2】A 22-year-old man has been brought by ambulance to the emergency department after  删除换行1 his girlfriend found him unconscious at home. She says that he is a regular heroin user.
She found him with a needle and syringe in his hand but is unsure what he had injected  删除换行1 himself with. He has no medical or surgical history.

【3】Examination

【4】This young man is drowsy but rousable. His pupils are very small. His respiratory rate is  删除换行1 6/min but his lungs sound clear. He has needle track marks up his arm, as well as a fresh  删除换行1 puncture mark in the left antecubital fossa.

【5】Questions

【6】• How can this patient’s consciousness level be assessed?

【7】• What is the likely cause of the reduced consciousness?

【8】• How would you manage this patient?
ANSWER 81

【9】There are two main scoring systems used for assessing a patient’s consciousness level: 

【10】the AVPU and the GCS.

【11】The AVPU score is based on noting whether the patient is:

【12】A Alert spontaneously;

【13】V alert to Voice;

【14】P alert to Pain;

【15】U Unresponsive.

【16】Although the system is not very detailed, it does allow you to very rapidly note how  删除换行1 responsive a patient is and often prompts you to take action and call for help if the  删除换行1 patient is scoring a V or less.

【17】The second commonly used scoring system is the Glasgow Coma Scale 删除25：<u></u>.
Patients score points for their verbal response, whether their eyes are open, and the movements that they make. The GCS is an objective score that allows a patient’s neurological  删除换行1 function to be accurately assessed and monitored.

【18】Table 81.1 Scoring on the Glasgow Coma Scale

【19】GCS score Best  删除换行1 eye response (E)

【20】Best  删除换行1 verbal response (V)

【21】Best  删除换行1 motor response (M) 删除换行1 1 Does not open eyes Makes no sounds Makes no movements 删除换行1 2 Eyes open to pain Incomprehensible  删除换行1 sounds

【22】Extension to painful stimuli  删除换行1 (decerebrate response)
3 Eyes open to voice Inappropriate words Abnormal flexion to  删除换行1 painful stimuli (decorticate  删除换行1 response) 删除换行1 4 Eyes open  删除换行1 spontaneously 删除换行5 Confused Flexes/withdraws from  删除换行1 painful stimuli 删除换行1 5 – Orientated, normal  删除换行1 conversation

【23】Localizes painful stimuli 删除换行1 6 – – Moves obeying commands

【24】The patient has a history of substance misuse, and from the examination it can be concluded that he has injected himself with something, probably heroin. Like morphine,  删除换行1 heroin is an opiate drug and features of opiate toxicity are manifold.

【25】• Respiratory system. There is a slow respiratory rate with shallow breathing. This can  删除换行1 progress to respiratory arrest.

【26】• Abdominal system. Vomiting is common and, if the patient has a reduced consciousness level, there is a risk of aspirating (inhaling) the vomit. Later, once the patient has  删除换行1 recovered, he/she is likely to be constipated, as the opiate drug will slow intestinal  删除换行1 motility.

【27】• Neurological system. Patients show a reduced consciousness level and may be unable  删除换行1 to protect the airway. They may present anywhere on a spectrum from alert and orientated, to confused and drowsy, to comatose. A classic sign of opiate toxicity is small  删除换行1 pupils, which are often described as ‘pin-point’.

【28】The first thing to do is assess the patient according to the ABCD protocol. Then a scoring  删除换行1 system should be applied. For example, a GCS score of 8 or less means that the patient 217 删除换行1 is probably not able to safely protect his/her own airway, so simple airway management  删除换行1 techniques should be carried out until a senior doctor or member of the anaesthetics team  删除换行1 can assess for more definitive airway management.

【29】Naloxone is an opiate antagonist and can be used to reverse the effects of morphine and  删除换行1 heroin. Naloxone acts within seconds and patients will often dramatically regain consciousness, but the drug effect lasts only for a few minutes. An infusion of naloxone may  删除换行1 need to be given; ideally this would be done in a high-dependency setting.

【30】KEY POINTS

【31】• In any patient with a reduced consciousness level, a neurological scoring system  删除换行1 should be applied. This allows monitoring of improvement or deterioration in  删除换行1 consciousness.

【32】• Signs of opiate overdose include reduced consciousness level, pin-point pupils,  删除换行1 reduced respiratory rate and vomiting.

【33】• With a suspected opiate overdose, help from senior doctors should be sought as the  删除换行1 patient may need to be managed in a high-dependency setting.删除6：<u>This page intentionally left blank 219</u>王磊
