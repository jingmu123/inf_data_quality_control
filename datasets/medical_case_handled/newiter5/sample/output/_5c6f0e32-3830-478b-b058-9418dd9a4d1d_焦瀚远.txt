【0】CASE 63: CHICKEN POX EXPOSURE IN PREGNANCY

【1】A woman has telephoned the antenatal clinic for advice. She is 16 weeks’ gestation in her  删除换行1 second pregnancy. She took her son to a birthday party yesterday and has been telephoned  删除换行1 now by the party host to say that one of the other children at the party has just developed a  删除换行1 typical chicken pox rash.

【2】She is worried about the effect of chicken pox on her pregnancy.

【3】Questions

【4】• What, if any, further questions do you need to ask her?

【5】• What investigations should be performed?

【6】• How will you advise and manage the case depending on the investigation results?

【7】ANSWER 63

【8】Chicken pox (caused by varicella zoster virus) is a very common, highly contagious and generally self-limiting mild childhood illness, mostly spread by respiratory droplets. Ninety per cent  删除换行1 of antenatal women will have been previously infected with chicken pox and immunity can  删除换行1 be demonstrated by the presence of varicella zoster virus (VZV) IgG antibodies in the serum.

【9】Questions to be asked

【10】• Does the woman know whether she has had chicken pox before?

【11】• What was the nature of her contact with the affected child?

【12】• What was the duration of her contact with the affected child?

【13】When asked she can’t remember whether or not she had chicken pox as a child. It was an  删除换行1 indoor party and she herself had stayed at the party with her son for about 30 minutes.

【14】Investigations to be performed

【15】In many cases, a blood sample will have been retained from the antenatal booking blood tests  删除换行1 that can be tested for VZV immunoglobulin (IgG). Otherwise the woman should be asked  删除换行1 to have blood taken urgently for VZV IgG (ideally taken at the general practitioner’s practice  删除换行1 so that she does not attend the antenatal clinic and potentially infect other non-immune  删除换行1 pregnant women).

【16】Advice and management

【17】If the serum varicella IgG is positive then immunity is confirmed and the woman can be  删除换行1 reassured that neither she nor her fetus is at risk of infection.

【18】Maternal risks

【19】If the IgG is negative then she is not immune and more than 15 minutes in the same room  删除换行1 as the infected individual is sufficient to place her at risk of infection. She should be given  删除换行1 varicella immunoglobulin VZIG as soon as possible (effective if given up to 10 days after contact). She should then be advised that she is still potentially infectious and to avoid any other  删除换行1 pregnant women during the infectious period of 8–28 days after exposure.

【20】The risk of maternal varicella to the mother is greater than in the mild childhood form of  删除换行1 the illness. Pneumonia, encephalitis and hepatitis are the potential complications. Maternal  删除换行1 death is reported in 1 per cent of affected pregnant women (five times higher than in nonpregnant women). If she is infected then the rash would be expected to appear within 1–3  删除换行1 weeks. She must be advised to seek medical attention at the outset of a rash developing and  删除换行1 should be prescribed acyclovir orally at the start of symptoms. She must be referred to hospital for supportive care and intravenous acyclovir if chest symptoms, neurological symptoms  删除换行1 or a haemorrhagic rash occurs.

【21】Fetal risks

【22】The risk of miscarriage is not increased in women who develop chicken pox in the first trimester. However fetal varicella syndrome (skin scarring, limb hypoplasia and neurological  删除换行1 abnormalities) may occur in 1 per cent of fetuses of women infected up to 28 weeks, as a result  删除换行1 of herpes zoster reactivation after the initial infection. Specialist fetal medicine ultrasound  删除换行1 5 weeks after initial infection may detect the anatomical abnormalities. If infection occurs  删除换行1 before 12 weeks’ gestation the chance of varicella syndrome is much lower.Case 63: Chicken pox exposure in pregnancy

【23】Maternal infection at term carries the risk of varicella of the newborn which is a severe  删除换行1 infection with up to 30 per cent mortality if untreated. The risk is approximately 30 per  删除换行1 cent in infants of mothers infected 1–4 weeks before delivery, with highest risk conferred if  删除换行1 infection is within 7 days of delivery. If possible delivery should therefore be delayed until  删除换行1 after recovery from maternal infection to allow transplacental transfer of maternal antibodies to the fetus. VZIG should be given to the susceptible neonate.

【24】If the woman is non-immune but does not develop the infection then vaccination should be  删除换行1 recommended after delivery.

【25】KEY POINTS

【26】• Chicken pox in pregnancy is potentially much more severe than in nonpregnant  删除换行1 adults, with maternal death reported in up to 1 per cent of affected women.

【27】• VZV is spread by respiratory droplets with same room contact for more than 15  删除换行1 minutes considered to place a nonimmune woman at high risk.

【28】• VZIgG should be given as soon as possible after exposure.

【29】• Fetal risks of maternal chicken pox infection are fetal varicella syndrome (if mother  删除换行1 infected before 28 weeks) or varicella of the newborn (if mother infected 1–4 weeks  删除换行1 before delivery).
