【0】Question: A woman comes to the physician because of profuse vomiting and watery, non-bloody diarrhea that developed five hours after she had eaten tuna salad. She is diagnosed with food poisoning. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her symptoms?

【1】> (A) A β-hemolytic, gram-positive rod

【2】> (B) A gram-positive, catalase-positive, coagulase-positive coccus

【3】> (C) A pre-formed enterotoxin

【4】> (D) A pre-formed superantigen

【5】> (E) An invasive gram-negative rod

【6】 Answer: The correct answer is C . The rapid onset of vomiting and diarrhea associated with Staphylococcus aureus food poisoning is not due to the bacterium itself but rather to ingestion of pre-formed enterotoxin. Mayonnaise and egg products are common sources.  
Answer A is incorrect . Bacillus cereus is a gram-positive, β-hemolytic rod that is often associated with food poisoning from reheated rice. Much like S aureus , it can produce a pre-formed toxin that can result in food poisoning.  
Answer B is incorrect . Gram-positive, catalase-positive, coagulase-positive bacteria include S aureus , which is likely the source of the preformed enterotoxin. However, the preformed enterotoxin is responsible for this patient’s symptoms of food poisoning.  
Answer D is incorrect . S aureus can also produce the superantigen TSST-1, which mediates toxic shock syndrome. This patient is not exhibiting symptoms of toxic shock syndrome, which include fever, rash, and shock.  
Answer E is incorrect . Raw or undercooked seafood is a common cause of Vibrio parahaemolyticus or V vulnificus infection. These pathogens cause disease by direct invasion of the intestinal mucosa. The incubation period from ingestion to illness is about three days; S aureus toxin causes illness within hours of ingestion.苏锦恭
