【0】Case 1.4 A 24-year-old female with fever and arm swelling

【1】A 24-year old Caucasian female was admitted through the emergency room (ER) in late August 2009 because of swelling of the left elbow area.

【2】Infectious diseases consult was sought 3 days later on 8/31/09 because of continued high fever， pain， and swelling of the arm.

【3】The past medical history was significant for "crack cocaine" and other sub-stance abuse， including oxycontin， and "crystal meth" (methamphetamine). She had failed a previous drug rehab treatment 2 years earlier. She had a history of anxiety and depression， asthma， hypertension， gastroesophageal reflux disease， and previous genital herpes infection. She had smoked a pack of cigarettes a day for 10 years and had no known drug allergies.

【4】Epidemiologically important is that the patient had injected "crack cocaine"dissolved in water into her left arm (antecubitalarea) about I week before admis-sion. Progressively worsening pain had been noted in the left elbow over the3-4 days prior to admission.

【5】On examination， she was alert， depressed， but not in acute distress. Her vital signs on 8/31/09 were as follows： BP 106/75， RR 16， HR 90， temperature 99.0°F； height 5'8"， and weight 136 pounds. The maximum temperature on 8/29/09， I day after admission， was 104°F. Head and neck examination showed thrush while the heart， lung， and abdominal exams were unremarkable. She had tender 删除换行1 left axillary adenopathy， but no other abnormal lymph node enlargements. The rest of the skin (other than the left arm) was healthy looking， except for tattoos. The neurologic exam was significant for a depressed affect， but no focal findings.

【6】Hospital course， laboratory findings， and follow-up

【7】The initial ISD of the left arm done on 8/28/09 was limited. The cultures obtained showed mixed organisms that included the following： group C Strep-tococcus， Streptococcus mitis/oralis， as well as diphtheroids. Additional I6Ds were done on 8/31/09， with obtained specimens showing a pure culture of group C Streptococcus. HIV serology was negative， as was serology for acute hepatitis A， B， and C. She was hospitalized from 8/28 to 9/5/09， a total of 8 days， before dis-charge to outpatient wound care and follow-up on oral amoxicillin/clavulanate and levofloxacin.

【8】Comments

【9】She was seen in the office 19 days after admission (9/16/09)， with the wounds almost healed. She failed to show up for her scheduled final visit 2 months later.

【10】I spoke to the patient by telephone nearly 6 years later in 2015. She was still struggling with aspects of drug addiction， but was well.

【11】It is thought that she acquired her infection through injection drug use under unsterile conditions (crack cocaine or oxycontin dissolved in water). She required about three surgical debridement procedures before discharge from the hospital. Initial ultrasound examination of the arm on 8/28/09 suggested heterogeneous hypoechoic abscess or hematoma within the antecubitus. MRI2 days later confirmed the presence of superficial perivascular and subcutaneous abscesses plus diffuse edema and enhancement consistent with cellulitis of the whole left arm.黄艳玲
