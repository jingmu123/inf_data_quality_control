【2】QUESTION 29

【3】A 40-year-old woman presents to the dermatology clinic with a painful rash on the lower legs. The rash appeared suddenly on her bilateral legs with firm, painful nodules underneath the skin and seemed to spread within 1 week. Her medical history is notable for hypertension, poorly controlled Crohn’s disease and fibromyalgia. On physical examination, there are numerous red-brown subcutaneous nodules that are painful to the touch on the patient’s anterior lower legs 通用删除7(英):<u>( 29 )</u>. A biopsy is performed and demonstrates a septal panniculitis with lymphocytes and scattered neutrophils.

【4】i. What is the diagnosis?

【5】ii. What are the common causes of this condition?

【6】iii. What is the prognosis and treatment?

【7】Answer 29

【8】i. This patient presents with erythema nodosum (EN), which is a form of panniculitis that is considered to be a delayed hypersensitivity reaction. It can occur at any age and is seen equally across different sex and races. Erythema nodosum characteristically presents as painful erythematous subcutaneous nodules, most often located symmetrically on the anterior shins, thighs and forearms. Occasionally, systemic symptoms can be associated with EN, including arthritis, arthralgia, fever and malaise.

【9】ii. Erythema nodosum is often observed in the setting of various systemic diseases, although the largest proportion of cases (up to 50%) is categorized as idiopathic. Infections are common causes of EN, most commonly streptococcal infections and less often, bacterial gastroenteritis and viral upper respiratory tract infections. Other causes of EN include drugs such as estrogens and oral contraceptives, penicillin and biologic agents, sarcoidosis and inflammatory bowel disease, with a stronger association observed between EN and Crohn’s disease than with ulcerative colitis. Less common causes of EN include Chlamydia trachomatis infections, Mycoplasma pneumonia infections, tuberculosis, hepatitis B, Sweet’s syndrome and pregnancy.

【10】In the setting of Crohn’s disease, EN can be seen prior to or contemporaneously with a flare. The presence of EN is considered as a prognostic factor in some instances; EN is associated with a more benign and self-limited form of sarcoidosis.

【11】iii. The treatment of uncomplicated, mild EN consists of bed rest, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and potassium iodide. For more severe cases, colchicine, prednisone, dapsone and hydroxychloroquine have been used with success in a small series of patients. Treatment of the underlying condition is an important component of the management of erythema nodosum.焦瀚远
