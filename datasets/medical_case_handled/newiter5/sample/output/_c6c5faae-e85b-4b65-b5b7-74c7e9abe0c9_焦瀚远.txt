【0】Question: A 3-year-old boy is brought to the hospital with acute shortness of breath. He was playing with marbles in the playground when his mother noticed him cough and become acutely short of breath. Her attempt to dislodge the object on site was unsuccessful, and he was brought to the hospital. Prior to this incident he was healthy. His vaccinations are up-to-date, and he takes no medications. On chest x-ray, which portion of the lung is most likely to appear abnormal?

【1】> (A) Left lower lobe

【2】> (B) Left upper lobe

【3】> (C) Lingula

【4】> (D) Right lower lobe

【5】> (E) Right upper lobe

【6】 Answer: The correct answer is D. The right main bronchus is more vertical and wider than the left, and aspirated particles are more likely to lodge at the junction of the right inferior and right middle bronchi. Because of this, aspiration pneumonia contracted when an individual is in an upright position is most common in the right lower and middle lobes. On x-ray, the right lower lobe may appear collapsed as a result of foreign object aspiration.  
Answer A is incorrect. The left main bronchus is narrower and less vertical than the right main bronchus. The right main bronchus is more vertical and wider than the left, and aspirated particles are more likely to lodge at the junction of the right inferior and right middle bronchi.  
Answer B is incorrect. The left main bronchus is narrower and less vertical than the right main bronchus. The right main bronchus is more vertical and wider than the left, and aspirated particles are more likely to lodge at the junction of the right inferior and right middle bronchi.  
Answer C is incorrect. The lingula is in the left lung, and the left main bronchus is narrower and less vertical than the right main bronchus. The right main bronchus is more vertical and wider than the left, and aspirated particles are more likely to lodge at the junction of the right inferior and right middle bronchi.  
Answer E is incorrect. When a person is supine, aspiration pneumonia may affect the upper lobes and posterior segments of the lungs, since they become the gravity-dependent regions when a person lies flat.焦瀚远
