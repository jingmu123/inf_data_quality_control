【2】QUESTION 68

【3】A 78-year-old man with a history of prostate cancer and osteoarthritis presents with a 3-month history of a burning, tender rash in the groin. He reports that it worsened over the last several months after he suffered a fall and was immobilized in bed for several weeks. He has tried to treat the area with numerous over-the-counter antifungals, which helps reduce the rash slightly for short periods of time, but it recurs. On examination, there is an erythematous, macerated, eroded plaque in the inguinal folds extending to the scrotum and the medial thigh with surrounding scattered satellite papules and pustules 通用删除7(英):<u>( 68 )</u>.

【4】i. Which pathogen is responsible for this eruption?

【5】ii. What other cutaneous manifestations can this pathogen produce?

【6】iii. What populations are at higher risk of infection?

【7】iv. What is the next best step in treatment?

【8】Answer 68

【9】i. Intertrigo is a commonly used term to define inflammation within the skin folds. Superimposed infection with Candida can occur in areas of occlusion and particularly after periods of prolonged immobilization. The most common candida species that cause mucocutaneous candidiasis are Candida albicans and C. tropicalis.

【10】Candidal intertrigo usually involves the inguinal folds, between the buttocks, and/or inframammary folds. It classically presents with brightly erythematous irritable skin in moist areas that develops cracks or fissures. The rash is often sore and satellite papules, pustules or vesicles are often seen at the periphery. Candidiasis in the web spaces between the fingers is also known as erosio interdigitalis blastomycetica. It most commonly occurs between the third and fourth digits and is seen in individuals whose hands or feet are frequently exposed to water.

【11】ii. In addition to intertrigo, candidal infections can produce a wide range of mucocutaneous manifestations, including oral candidiasis or oral thrush, angular cheilitis, vulvovaginal candidiasis in women, balanitis in men, chronic paronychia, onychomycosis and chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC).

【12】CMC describes a group of disorders involving progressive and recurrent candidal infections of the skin, nails and mucous membranes with C. albicans . It is typically seen in patients with significant underlying immunologic abnormalities or autoimmune endocrinopathies.

【13】iii. There are various predisposing factors for mucocutaneous candidiasis, including diabetes mellitus, occlusion or immobilization, hyperhidrosis, use of corticosteroids or antibiotics and immunosuppressed status.

【14】CMC is observed in association with immunodeficiency disorders such as severe combined immunodeficiency, DiGeorge syndrome and hyper-IgE syndrome, as well as other non-immunologic inherited disorders such as keratitis ichthyosis deafness (KID) syndrome, multiple carboxylase deficiency, acrodermatitis enteropathica and ectodermal dysplasia–ectrodactyly–clefting syndrome. A subgroup of CMC occurs in the setting of autoimmune polyendocrinopathy–candidiasis–ectodermal dystrophy syndrome (APECED) and dectin-1 deficiency.

【15】iv. The treatment of mucocutaneous candidal infections depends on the type of infection. Oral medications include fluconazole, itraconazole and nystatin (swish and swallow for oropharyngeal candidiasis). Topical treatments include clotrimazole, miconazole, tioconazole and nystatin. For candidal intertrigo or balanitis, topical imidazoles or ciclopirox can be used, with systemic agents reserved for recalcitrant or severe cases.

【16】CMC does not typically respond to standard topical medications. Treatment usually requires long-term therapy with oral systemic antifungal agents.焦瀚远
