---------------

【12】The present case presents a RF catheter ablation procedure of an antero-septal accessory pathway (T12) with bidirectional conduction properties in a 29-year-old male patient with no structural heart disease. Several observations can be made about the present case.

【13】Antero-septal accessory pathways represent around 7% to 9% of all accessory pathways 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 1 – 3 \]</u>.

【14】ECG characteristics suggesting an antero-septal location of the accessory pathway include positive delta waves in leads II, III, aVF, and isoelectric/negative delta waves in V1.

【15】RF ablation of antero-septal accessory pathways can be attempted using RF energy or, in order to minimize the risk of inadvertent AV block, with cryo energy 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 3 , 4 \]</u>. Ablation of the accessory pathway should be attempted targeting its ventricular insertion 删除33：<u>通用删除1(英):<u>(as shown in Fig. 15.14 , right panel)</u></u>, since the fibrous tissue isolating the bundle of His protects the conduction tissue at this level from thermal injury; ablation should not target the atrial insertion of the accessory pathway, since this can be in close proximity to the compact AV node, and ablation attempts in this area can produce complete AV block.

【16】Another ablation issue of antero-septal accessory pathway is catheter instability. A good contact between the ablation catheter and the accessory pathway is crucial in order to perform successful ablation and to avoid recurrences. Frequently, a stabilizing sheath is required in order to improve catheter stability in this region.

【17】Using an electroanatomical mapping system to guide mapping and ablation of antero-septal pathways has the advantage of reducing the fluoroscopy time and dose throughout the procedure, and to allow assessment of proper catheter positioning at the optimal ablation site. Contact force evaluation before ablating the accessory pathway is also an advantage. It is our experience to titrate RF energy from 10 to 15 W and increase the target power up to 25 to 30 W in this region if conduction block at the level of the accessory pathway but not at the level of the normal conduction system is observed during the first 10 s of RF application. Up to date, there is no ablation index suggested value as a definite end-point for the ablation. The value that we use is 450. Additional “consolidating” RF lesions can be applied at the successful ablation site, in order to minimize the risk of recurrence, but always weighing the risk/benefit ratio for any extra lesion in this area.

【18】Some authors have suggested and successfully performed RF ablation of antero-septal pathways from the non-coronary aortic cusp 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 5 , 6 \]</u>.

【19】Learning Point

【20】   Catheter ablation of right antero-septal accessory pathways can be accomplished with a high success rate and a low complication rate.
   When bidirectional conduction is present via the accessory pathway, performing 2 activation maps (that of the earliest atrial activation during V pacing/ORT and that of the earliest ventricular activation site during sinus rhythm/atrial pacing/ART) is very useful, since they provide information about both the atrial and the ventricular insertion site of the accessory pathway. Ablation should be done in between the atrial and the ventricular insertion site, to maximize the success rate.
   If the AP is dangerously close to the His bundle, RF energy should be applied on the ventricular part of the annulus, in order to minimize the risk of inadvertent AV node injury (at a site where the amplitude of the local V electrogram >amplitude of the local A electrogram).
   When ablating antero-septal accessory pathways, catheter stability is an issue. This can be improved by using a long deflectable sheath that confers a better contact between the catheter tip and the myocardium.黄艳玲
