【0】CASE 64: A PIGMENTED NODULE ON THE BACK

【1】History
A 29-year-old man presents with a nodule over his posterior trunk. He had recently  删除换行1 moved into a flat with friends who had noticed the lesion and advised him to go to the  删除换行5 GP. As far as the patient can remember he has had a mole on his back since childhood  删除换行1 at the site of the nodule. He has Fitzpatrick skin type I and always burns in the sun, if  删除换行1 not careful, and never tans. His family is also fair skinned. He is otherwise well and takes  删除换行1 no medication.
Examination

【2】There is a reddish brown nodule arising from a deeply pigmented, irregular macule with  删除换行1 variable colour 删除33：<u></u>. Full skin examination reveals freckling over his face and  删除换行1 shoulders and multiple acquired moles which looked benign.

【3】INVESTIGATIONS

【4】Excision of the lesion was performed.

【5】Questions

【6】• What is the likely diagnosis?

【7】• What determines his prognosis?
• How should this patient be managed?

【9】ANSWER 64

【10】This young man has a nodular pigmented lesion on the posterior trunk that has changed  删除换行1 in size, shape and colour. The clinical appearance of this lesion should immediately raise  删除换行1 the possibility of a nodular malignant melanoma.

【11】Any patient concerned about a mole or skin lesion should have a full skin examination to  删除换行1 check all their moles. A suspected melanoma should be excised for histological analysis  删除换行1 with a 2-mm margin around it. The pathologist will report the thickness of the melanoma –  删除换行1 the Breslow thickness (local invasion) in millimetres. This is the measurement between  删除换行1 the granular cell layer to the deepest identifiable melanoma cell. The full skin check of  删除换行1 a patient with a suspected malignant melanoma should also include examination of the  删除换行1 lymph nodes.
The ‘gold standard’ treatment of melanomas is surgical. The extent of surgery depends  删除换行1 on the thickness of the melanoma and its site. A small area of normal skin around the  删除换行1 melanoma is also excised to ensure that all melanoma cells have been removed. This is  删除换行1 termed a wide local excision (WLE). For lesions with a Breslow thickness of  1 mm  删除换行1 a 1-cm WLE is required; for lesions  1 mm a 2-cm WLE is advised. For these thicker  删除换行1 melanomas a technique called a sentinel lymph node biopsy may be offered to patients  删除换行1 to exclude lymphatic spread. The sentinel lymph node biopsy can predict the presence  删除换行1 of clinically non-detectable metastatic melanoma within regional lymph nodes through  删除换行1 histopathology. The first node draining a lymphatic basin is termed the ‘sentinel node’.
If positive, a full basin clearance is offered and all the nodes are examined for further  删除换行1 micro-metastases.

【12】If the melanoma has spread to distant sites adjuvant therapies may be offered, but the  删除换行1 prognosis is very poor. Distant metastases most commonly occur in lungs, liver, brain,  删除换行1 bone and intestines.
Prognosis is determined by the staging classification: local disease T 1–4 a, b; disease in  删除换行1 the regional lymph nodes N 1–3; and distant spread M 1a, b, c. The thinner the Breslow  删除换行1 thickness, the better the prognosis. For those patients whose melanoma is  4 mm thick,  删除换行1 50 per cent will die within 5 years.
Following diagnosis, regular follow-up is essential to detect any recurrence. This includes  删除换行1 local, lymphatic (lymph nodes) and blood borne (to distant sites). Examination of the  删除换行1 scar site to exclude in-transit metastases, full skin examination, lymph node checks and  删除换行1 palpation for organomegaly are required. A full systematic review should also be performed to exclude any distant spread. The periodicy and regularity of follow-up is also  删除换行1 determined by the stage of the melanoma.

【13】 KEY POINTS

【14】• Patients with a changing naevus should have a full skin examination.
• Breslow thickness measures the invasion depth of a melanoma in millimetres.

【15】• Sentinel lymph node biopsy predicts clinically non-detectable metastatic disease.焦瀚远
