【0】28.11Which of the following patients may benefit from placement of an intracranial pressure monitor?

【1】A.A 24year-old man who fell from 10 ft and presented with a GCS of 7 but a normal head CT scan.

【2】B. A 28-year-old man involved in a highspeed motor vehicle collision with a GCS of 8 who is receiving propofol and has a right-sided subdural hematoma.

【3】C.A 19-year-old woman who has fallen from standing and has a witnessed seizure but has a GCS of 9 and a small subarachnoid hemorrhage.

【4】D. An 82-year-old man who fell from his bed， is confused， and cannot move his left side.

【5】E.A 17-year-old man with an epidural hematoma based on CT and GCS of 15.

【6】28.2 A 35-year-old woman is in a high-speed motor vehicle crash. On presenta-tion， she is complaining of abdominal pain. Her pulse is 136， blood pressure is 76/40， and she is confused. A FAST examination is positive for fluid. The best next step is：

【7】Intubation

【8】CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis

【9】Exploratory laparotomySAdmission to the intensive care unit

【10】E.Mesenteric angiography and embolization of bleeding vessels

【11】28.3 A 23-year-old man is involved in a 10-ft fall from a ladder. He complains of pelvic pain. On arrival his heart rate is 120 beats/minute and his blood pres-sure is 90/65 mm Hg. On examination he has ecchymoses of his buttocks. X-rays identify pelvic fracture with a widened pubic symphysis. FAST exami-nation is normal. The best next step is：

【12】Placement of pelvic binder in emergency room

【13】Angiography

【14】Exploratory laparotomy

【15】D. CT of the abdomen/pelvis

【16】E.Open reduction and internal fixation of the pelvis

【17】ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS

【18】28.1 B. Although there are insufficient data to make Level I recommendations， patient B does fulfill the criteria of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons for possible intracranial pressure monitoring. These criteria are： CT confirmed intracranial hemorrhage， GCS of 8 or less， and receiving sedation.

【19】28.2 C. This scenario describes a patient who was involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision and is hemodynamically unstable. Her FAST examination is positive suggesting intraabdominal hemorrhage. She requires exploratory laparotomy. Bleeding takes priority in this instance， since without control of hemorrhage she is likely to die； she is already hemodynamically unstable， suggesting that she is in Class IV shock. Angiography and embolization are options for relatively stable patients with solid organ injuries， and reasoning behind embolization is that early embolization can help avoid surgical inter-ventions in some of the patients. If this patient stabilizes with resuscitation and a CT demonstrates such injuries， then angiography and embolization can be viable options.

【20】28.3 A. This patient has a pelvic fracture with a pattern known to result in bleed-ing. Additionally， he is hemodynamically unstable. A normalFAST examina tion has ruled out intra-abdominal hemorrhage. It must be assumed that his hemodynamic instability is secondary to bleeding from his pelvic fracture. The first step is to place a pelvic binder to reduce the potential pelvic space where bleeding can occur. If his hemodynamic status improves， he would not need angiography. If he continues to deteriorate despite placement of the binder and transfusion， he would require angiography and possible embolization of branches of the internal iliac artery which may be bleeding.

【21】CLINICAL PEARLS

【22】Patients who have suffered blunt polytrauma can have multiple poten-tially lethal injuries. It is the physician's responsibility to triage the patient's injuries.

【23】The great majority of mild head injuries (GCS 13-15) can be monitored and do not require intervention.

【24】A positive FAST examination in a hypotensive patient mandates exploration.

【25】Several radiographic findings can help predict success of nonoperative management of spleen injuries.

【26】Liver injury management (operative vs nonoperative) is dictated by the patient's clinical status.黄艳玲
