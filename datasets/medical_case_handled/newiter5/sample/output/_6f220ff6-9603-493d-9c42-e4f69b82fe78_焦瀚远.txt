【0】Question: 5.1 A 7-month-old baby boy is brought into the office for a possible ear infection. In assessing the infant’s posture, you note that he is not able to sit very well without support. You also observe other fine motor skills and speech. Which of the following is the most accurate statement?

【1】A. By 3 months of age, a child should be able to sit up without support.

【2】B. By 6 months of age, a child should be able to transfer objects from one hand to another.

【3】C. By 9 months of age, a child should be able to walk.

【4】D. By 12 months of age, a child should be able to put two words together.

【5】Answer: 5.1 B . It is critical to understand the normal milestones for gross motor, fine motor, speech and social categories. Delay in one or more areas can indicate problems which if addressed can alleviate long-term issues. Most 6-month-old children would be expected to sit without support. Six-month-old children would also be expected to transfer objects from one hand to the other, roll from a prone to supine position, babble, and recognize strangers.

【6】Question: 5.2 A 5-year-old presents to your clinic for a school physical. The child weighs 42 lb and is up-to-date on his immunizations. Which of the following anticipatory guidances is most appropriate for a child at this age?

【7】A. He should ride in a rear-facing car seat in the back seat of the vehicle.

【8】B. He should ride in a forward-facing car seat in the back seat of the vehicle.

【9】C. He should ride in a forward-facing car seat in the front seat of the vehicle.

【10】D. He should ride in a booster seat in the back seat of the vehicle.

【11】Answer: 5.2 D . A child who weighs more than 20 lb and is older than 1 year of age may sit in a forward-facing car seat in the back seat of the car. A child who weighs more than 40 lb is usually big enough to use a booster seat, also in the back seat of the car.

【12】Question: 5.3 A 4-month-old infant is brought into the family physician’s office for routine checkup and immunizations. Which of the following vaccines is routinely recommended at this time?

【13】A. Diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis (DTaP)

【14】B. Oral polio vaccine (OPV)

【15】C. Measles, mumps, rubella (MMR)

【16】D. Varicella

【17】Answer: 5.3 A . DTaP is routinely recommended at ages 2, 4, 6, and 12 to 18 months, and at 4 to 6 years of age. Oral polio vaccination is no longer routinely recommended in children; the inactivated, injectable polio vaccine is recommended in its place and is recommended at ages 2, 4, 6 to 18 months and 4 to 6 years. MMR and varicella vaccination are recommended at ages 12 to 15 months and 4 to 6 years.

【18】Question: 5.4 A 5-year-old child is brought into the pediatrician’s office for immunization and physical examination. The mother is concerned that her child is a little “under the weather.” Which of the following is a contraindication to vaccinating the child?

【19】A. Acute otitis media with a temperature of 100°F requiring antibiotic therapy

【20】B. Previous vaccination reaction that consisted of fever and fussiness that lasted for 2 days

【21】C. History of an allergic reaction to penicillin

【22】D. Previous vaccination reaction that consisted of wheezing and hypotension
Answer: 5.4 D . A previous anaphylactic reaction is a true contraindication to vaccination. Minor illnesses or vaccination reactions, even with fever, are not contraindications. Penicillin is not a component of vaccines and history of allergy to this medication is not a contraindication.

【23】CLINICAL PEARLS

【24】 True contraindications to providing vaccinations are rare; acute care visits are an excellent opportunity to provide childhood vaccinations.

【25】 SIDS is the leading cause of death in infants younger than age 1 year. Parents should place their children on their “Back-to-Sleep.”焦瀚远
