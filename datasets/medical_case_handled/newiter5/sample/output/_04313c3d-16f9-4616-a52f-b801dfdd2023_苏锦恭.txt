【0】CASE 12

【1】A couple is eating dinner at home with their quiet 6-year-old son. The couple gets into an argument and the father starts to yell at his son， who begins to cry. The mother gives the child candy， which temporarily relieves the crying. Throughout the meal， she continues to give him candy every time he cries. The father then yells at the child and takes away the candy because children who cry should not be given candy. The child is upset that his candy has been taken away and begins to throw food across the dining room table.

【2】What defense mechanism is the father using?

【3】The father is using displacement， which is characterized by the transfer of feelings from one object or person to another. In this case， the father's anger at the mother is displaced onto the child.

【4】What defense mechanism is the child using?

【5】The child is acting out， which is characterized by the use of extreme behavior to express a thought or feeling. In this case， the child is so overcome with anger that he cannot simply state， "I'm angry with you"； instead， he acts out by throwing food across the table.

【6】What type of reinforcement is the child using on the mother?

【7】This is an example of positive reinforcement， in which the consequences of a response increase the likelihood that the response will recur. Specifically， the child cries because crying makes it more likely the mother will continue to give him candy.

【8】How does negative reinforcement differ from punishment?

【9】In negative reinforcement， a behavior is encouraged or reinforced by the removal of an aversive stimulus(eg， if a mother constantly yells at her child to pick up his toys， he will learn to pick up his toys to avoid mom's yelling). In punishment， behavior is discouraged and reduced by administration of an aversive stimulus (eg， the mother puts the boy in a "time out" because he did not pick up his toys).

【10】Which method of conditioning is the father using by removing the reward?

【11】The father is employing extinction， which is the elimination of a behavior by nonreinforcement. The child likely will stop crying after discovering that there is no reward for the behavior.苏锦恭
