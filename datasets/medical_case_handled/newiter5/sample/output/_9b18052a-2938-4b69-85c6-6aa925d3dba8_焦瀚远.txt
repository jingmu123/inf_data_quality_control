【0】CASE 41: STANDARD OF CARE AND NEGLIGENCE

【1】Joe is on a busy ward round with his consultant. The round is post-take and he has seen 23  删除换行1 patients so far. One of his patients is septic and needs a prescription for intravenous antibiotics. The consultant tells Joe to put him on ciprofloxacin. However, Joe is aware that the  删除换行1 hospital protocol has changed and that ciprofloxacin is no longer the first-line antibiotic due  删除换行1 to the increasing incidence of Clostridium difficile infection after its use. He suggests giving intravenous co-amoxiclav instead. The consultant agrees and appears impressed that Joe  删除换行1 is up-to-date with the antibiotic guidelines. Joe prescribes the antibiotic. A few hours later  删除换行1 he is called to the ward urgently as the septic patient is having difficulty breathing and has  删除换行1 developed urticaria. He has had an anaphylactic reaction to co-amoxiclav. Joe realises that  删除换行1 the allergies box on the drug chart states that the patient is allergic to penicillin. He puts out  删除换行1 a medical emergency call and after further assessment the patient is transferred to ITU. After  删除换行1 24 hours on ITU the patient returns to the ward. No permanent damage has occurred.

【2】Questions

【3】• What is clinical negligence?

【4】• Has Joe been negligent?

【5】• What can he do to protect himself against a claim in negligence?

【6】ANSWER 41

【7】A healthcare professional owes a duty of care toward his patients. This duty is to exercise  删除换行1 reasonable skill and care in diagnosis, treatment and provision of healthcare information  删除换行1 (Case 42). The healthcare professional breaches his duty of care if he falls below the standard of care. For a doctor, this is the standard of care practised by a responsible body of  删除换行1 doctors professing that skill. A patient who has been harmed as a result of medical care  删除换行1 may bring a claim in negligence seeking compensation.

【8】A patient has to prove that a doctor is negligent by demonstrating that

【9】• The doctor owed the patient a duty of care

【10】• The doctor failed to give an appropriate standard of care

【11】• But for the failure of care, the harm would not have occurred and the harm is reasonably foreseeable

【12】The claim must be brought within 3 years of the date when the harm occurred or the date  删除换行1 when the patient knew or should have realised that he may have a claim. Experts provide evidence about the appropriate standard of care and will consider professional guidance issued  删除换行1 by the relevant speciality. If the claim is successful, compensation will be awarded and damages can be very high. In 2012 compensation worth £10.8 million was awarded to enable fulltime care and equipment for a girl who suffered injuries after doctors failed to notice that her  删除换行1 heart had stopped shortly after birth.
The NHS hospital trust is vicariously liable for negligence of its employees. A claim is brought  删除换行1 against the NHS trust employing the doctor who is alleged to have caused the harm. The  删除换行5 National Health Service Litigation Authority handles claims against the NHS in England. It  删除换行1 reported that there was a 10.8% increase in clinical claims (from 9,143 claims in 2011/12 to  删除换行1 10,129 in 2012/13) but less than 1% go to a court hearing. Nearly one-fifth 删除10：<u>(£22.7 billion in  删除换行1 2012)</u> of the NHS annual budget is set aside for compensation payments.
Litigation is a stressful and costly experience for claimants and has a negative effect on  删除换行5 NHS staff. The Francis Report published in 2013 following the inquiry into care at the Mid 

【13】Staffordshire Hospital recommended an open and transparent culture within the NHS.
There is now a ‘duty of candour’ on all NHS trusts in England which requires them to be  删除换行1 open and honest with patients and their families, admit their mistakes and apologise when  删除换行1 things go wrong.

【14】In this scenario it was Joe’s responsibility to check before prescribing medication that the  删除换行1 patient did not have any allergies. However, the nurse who gave the drug also has a responsibility to check allergies. Although Joe failed in his care to the patient, because there was no  删除换行1 long-term harm, it is unlikely that a claim for negligence would be pursued.

【15】Key Points

【16】• Clinical negligence claims are increasing and a large part of the NHS budget is set  删除换行1 aside for compensation awards.

【17】• A duty of candour requires healthcare professionals to be open and honest with  删除换行1 patients when something goes wrong.焦瀚远
