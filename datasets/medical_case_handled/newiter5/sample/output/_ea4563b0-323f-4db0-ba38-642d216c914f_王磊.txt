【0】CASE 98: PROFESSIONAL BOUNDARIES

【1】John is admitted to hospital following a car accident. He has multiple injuries and requires  删除换行1 full nursing care. During his stay in hospital he becomes very attached to one of the junior  删除换行1 doctors. He sees her every day on the ward round and she often stays to talk to him after taking his blood or changing his dressings. As John recovers he starts flirting with the doctor.She is flattered and is finding more and more reason to stay and talk to him. While she is  删除换行1 removing the sutures from a scar on his face, he tells her that she is beautiful and tries to kiss  删除换行1 her. Uncertain about what to do and her own feelings, the doctor leaves and avoids seeing  删除换行5 John for a few days. However, when he is discharged a week later she gives him her number  删除换行1 and says they should go out for a drink now that he is no longer an inpatient.

【2】Questions

【3】• Is it appropriate for a doctor to have a relationship with a patient?

【4】• What should a doctor do if she is serious about having a relationship with a patient?

【5】• Are their situations where relationships would be inappropriate even if the therapeutic relationship had ended?

【6】ANSWER 98

【7】The GMC guidance on relationships between doctors and patients is quite straightforward –  删除换行1 it does not condone it. As a healthcare professional it undermines the trust that a patient  删除换行1 places in them and potentially takes advantage of vulnerable individuals.

【8】You must not use your professional position to establish or pursue a sexual or improper  删除换行1 emotional relationship with a patient or someone close to them.

【9】General Medical Council, Good Medical Practice, 2013

【10】The same reasoning applies to medical students who are expected to establish their own  删除换行1 professional relationships with patients and must learn the importance of professionalism  删除换行1 删除10：<u>(General Medical Council, Medical Students: professional values and fitness to practise, 2009)</u>.
In some small villages it can be very difficult to meet people who are not patients. If it looks  删除换行1 like a relationship may be establishing itself then the doctor–patient relationship should be  删除换行1 stopped so that the two roles do not overlap. In its guidance ‘Maintaining a Professional  删除换行5 Boundary between You and Your Patient’ 通用删除7(英):<u>(2013)</u>, the GMC gives further recommendations  删除换行1 about what to do if a relationship is being considered with a former patient. It suggests looking at how long ago the patient had been treated by the doctor and what the nature of the  删除换行1 therapeutic relationship was. For example, it is unlikely that a relationship between a psychiatrist and their former patient would ever be condoned due to the vulnerability of the  删除换行1 patient. The guidance also states that where possible the therapeutic relationship should not  删除换行1 end merely so that an intimate relationship can begin. Special consideration also needs to be  删除换行1 given to the nature of relationships through social media networks (Case 86).

【11】When caring for patients, doctors should keep their distance professionally by not engaging in conversations about their own personal life. They should also dress appropriately and  删除换行1 not wear provocative clothing. When performing intimate procedures they should have a  删除换行1 chaperone with them so that the purpose of the procedure cannot be misconstrued (Case 97).

【12】There are several ethical arguments in favour of zero tolerance for sexual patient–doctor  删除换行1 relationships. These include the premise that sexual relationships will nearly always be harmful to the patient due to the imbalance in power between doctors and their patients. It is,  删除换行1 however, worth considering whether this is still relevant since medical practice is much more  删除换行1 patient oriented and less paternalistic. Virtue ethics argues that a good doctor is one who  删除换行1 extols virtues and that a doctor who commences a sexual relationship with a patient would  删除换行1 not be adhering to these virtues. Consequentialists could argue that any sexual relationship  删除换行1 between patients and doctors would inevitably lead to a breakdown in trust and respect of  删除换行1 the medical profession as a whole and as such should not be allowed as it would reflect poorly  删除换行1 on the profession.

【13】Key Points

【14】• Doctors and medical students must not enter into intimate or sexual relationships  删除换行1 with patients.

【15】• It is unethical to have a relationship with a patient since it jeopardises the trust that  删除换行1 the public has in healthcare professionals.删除个例：<u>Faith, Values and Culture</u>王磊
