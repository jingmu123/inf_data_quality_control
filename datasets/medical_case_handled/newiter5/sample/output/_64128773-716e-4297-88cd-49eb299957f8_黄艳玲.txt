【0】Question: A 16-year-old pregnant girl has not received prenatal care. At 17 weeks, she noted some painless vaginal spotting (bleeding) which prompted her to seek medical attention. On arrival at the hospital, pelvic examination showed fetal parts in the cervical os and the patient was told that a miscarriage was inevitable. The products of conception as delivered are shown in the image. What is the most likely pathogenesis of this condition?

【4】> (E) ToRCHeS infection

【5】 Answer: The correct answer is B. The patient has an omphalocele, which results from failure of closure of the anterior abdominal wall. In this midline abdominal wall defect, the herniated viscera are covered by a membrane consisting of the amniotic membranes, Wharton jelly, and peritoneum. Between 50% and 70% of children with omphalocele have additional congenital anomalies (including cardiac defects and genitourinary malformations such as bladder exstrophy), which are also thought to be related to ventral closure defects. The pathogenesis of omphalocele is believed to be sporadic defective closure of the abdominal wall secondary to malrotation of the midgut derivatives during the 10th week of embryonic development. Alternative theories include abnormal persistence of the primitive body stalk and the failure of body wall closure secondary to incomplete lateral body wall migration. The incidence of omphalocele is 1:5000 live births, and it is most commonly associated with extremes of maternal age (<20 or >40 years of age). It may be associated with a chromosomal abnormality if there is only herniation of the small bowel or the liver.  
Answer A is incorrect. Ethanol toxicity is not associated with abdominal wall defects. Ethanol exposure during embryogenesis is associated with fetal alcohol syndrome, which includes mental retardation and a typical facies characterized by a smooth philtrum, thin upper lip, and small palpebral fissures.  
Answer C is incorrect. Maternal folate deficiency is not associated with abdominal wall defects. Folate deficiency has been associated with a number of neural tube defects, including anencephaly and spina bifida. A myelomeningocele would be located at the posterior side (superior if using fetal terminology).  
Answer D is incorrect. Omphalomesenteric vessel occlusion and consequent ischemia is believed to be the cause of gastroschisis, another congenital abdominal wall defect. This condition is a full-thickness defect in the abdominal wall, and there is no protective membrane with a variable amount of herniation of the intestines and parts of other abdominal organs. Unlike omphalocele, gastroschisis herniation occurs to the right of the umbilicus, and is rarely associated with other congenital anomalies. Children with this defect should be given a warm moist occlusive dressing and receive immediate surgical intervention.  
Answer E is incorrect. The ToRCHeS infections include T oxoplasmosis, R ubella, C ytomegalovirus (CMV), H erpesvirus/HIV, and S yphilis. Congenital infection with one of the ToRCHeS viruses is not associated with abdominal wall defects. Instead, common manifestations include fevers, hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, poor feeding, and intrauterine growth restriction. Other specific signs include chorioretinitis, cataracts, and neural deafness (rubella); intracranial calcifications (toxoplasmosis); rhinitis, “blueberry-muffin” skin lesions, and interstitial keratitis (syphilis); cerebral calcifications (CMV); and vesicular skin lesions (herpes simplex virus).黄艳玲
