【0】Question: A 52-year-old woman is being treated by a male psychiatrist for depression stemming from her recent divorce. Recently, the patient has been coming to her appointments dressed up and wearing expensive perfumes. She has also started to flirt with the doctor. The patient’s demeanor and appearance had initially reminded the psychiatrist of his aunt. He is uncomfortable with the patient’s new behavior patterns and tells her so. She becomes very angry and storms out of the office, canceling all remaining appointments on her way out. Which of the following behaviors is an example of negative transference?

【1】> (A) The doctor seeing the patient as his aunt

【2】> (B) The doctor telling the patient he is uncomfortable

【3】> (C) The patient being angry with the doctor

【4】> (D) The patient dressing up for appointments

【5】> (E) The patient flirting with the doctor

【6】 Answer: The correct answer is C. Transference occurs when a patient projects feelings from his or her personal life onto a doctor; countertransference takes place when the doctor projects feelings onto the patient. These feelings can be either positive or negative. The patient’s anger at the doctor when her sexual advances are rebuffed is an example of negative transference.  
Answer A is incorrect. The doctor being reminded of his aunt by this patient is an example of countertransference.  
Answer B is incorrect. The doctor telling the patient that he is uncomfortable is not an example of countertransference or transference.  
Answer D is incorrect. The patient dressing up for appointments is positive transference.  
Answer E is incorrect. The patient flirting with the doctor is positive transference. In its most extreme form, positive transference can take the form of sexual desire.焦瀚远
