【1】A 17-Year-Old Cockatoo with aW Broken Blood Feathers﻿

【2】Signalment

【3】A 17-year-old female Umbrella cockatoo (Cacatua alba) was presented with a recent history of broken blood feathers.﻿

【4】History

【5】The cockatoo had broken four pin feathers associated with the primary flight feathers on both wings the night prior to presentation. The bleeding had stopped; however, several broken flight feathers on both wings resulted in dried blood, covering the feathers on the wings and body coverts.

【6】The client reported that the bird had been picking her feathers for the past 2 years, and this behavior had gotten worse during the past year. She also reported that the bird was presented to a veterinarian who specializes in birds a year earlier for a mass just cranial to the cloaca on the ventral side of the bird. At that time, the mass was considered to be benign and of no concern, according to the veterinarian. The "mass" had increased dramatically in size since that time. The bird laid a normal clutch of two eggs 4 months prior to presentation.

【7】The bird was housed in a commercial birdcage and fed a diet of commercial pellets and nuts. Other pets in the household included three dogs, a cat, and a Rosella parrot (Platycercus sp.).﻿

【8】Physical Examination Findings

【9】The 1.1-kg cockatoo was extremely nervous and exhibited frightened behavior and signs of stress in the examination room. Although it did not vocalize, it tried to escape capture. The bird exhibited severe alopecia owing to feather picking, resulting in a large area of missing feathers on the enlarged abdominal area. A large herniated area just cranial to cloaca was observed. Palpation of this area indicated soft-tissue structures and no hard mass. The droppings appeared normal, suggesting normal gastrointestinal and urinary function.

【10】Blood was collected via jugular venipuncture for a blood profile while the bird was placed under isoflurane anesthesia via face mask for whole body radiograph evaluations. A fine-needle aspiration biopsy of an in-tracoelomic mass was obtained for cytodiagnosis. The sample appeared clear and greasy when placed on the microscope slides 删除33：<u></u>.﻿

【11】Interpretive Discussion

【12】The initial whole body radiographs 删除33：<u></u> reveal a large soft-tissue opaque mass in the caudal dorsal aspect of the coelomic cavity, causing cranial and ventral displacement of the coelomic structures. This likely represents a neoplastic mass arising from the reproductive tract. There appears to be a marked enlargement of the hepatic silhouette, extending beyond the margins of the coxofemoral joint on the ven-trodorsal view. The enlarged hepatic silhouette can be associated with hepatomegaly, proventricular dilation, or an intracoelomic mass. There is a rounded soft-tissue opacity, extending beyond the caudal ventral aspect of the vent correlating with this patient's described history of having a hernia. The hernia is likely due to the space occupying mass in the caudal dorsal coelomic cavity. A rounded, oblong soft-tissue opacity ventral to the synsacrum can be seen on the lateral view. This likely represents either renomegaly or gonadomegaly. There is increased opacity within the long bones, representing medullary hyperostosis associated with follicular genesis.

【17】A continued radiographic study 删除33：<u></u> of the bird is compared with the initial study made the same day 85 minutes following the administration of 25 mL of a 92% liquid barium suspension diluted 1:2 with water via gavage. The proventriculus is normal in size. Owing to the limited progress of the barium's travel through the gastrointestinal tract after 85 minutes, the bird likely has decreased gastrointestinal motility. There is contrast within the small intestines, which is being ventrally displaced by the previously described soft-tissue mass in the caudodorsal coelomic cavity. There is a loop of small intestine (likely duodenum based on its shape) incorporated into the previously described hernia. The radiographic studies in this bird indicate herniation of small intestines owing to displacement by a soft-tissue mass in the coelomic cavity. Differentials include neoplasia arising from the urinary system or reproductive tract.

【19】The blood profile reveals a nonregenerative anemia. This is likely associated with an anemia of chronic disorders. There is no evidence of inflammation. The glucose is elevated, which is likely associated with a stress response. The plasma creatine kinase activity is increased owing to muscle exertion during handling or possible recent trauma to the skeletal muscles (the bird fell from the examination table onto the floor landing on her keel when being examined). The marked increase in the plasma calcium concentration is likely associated with current folliculogenesis activity as indicated by the hyperostosis of the long bones in the radiographic examinations.

删除3：<u>Figures 63.4 and 63.5 show a moderately cellular sample that contains a slight number of erythrocytes. There are large cells that occur in aggregates or singly. These cells have an abundant vacuolated cytoplasm and an eccentrically located oval nucleus. The background contains numerous round, clear spaces. These spaces and the clear vacuoles in the cells likely represent fat that does not stain with the Wright–Giemsa stain. The large cells are adipocytes and the cytology is representative of a lipoma or liposarcoma. The clear, oily appearance of the specimen on the slide indicates that the sample is from fatty tissue.</u>

【20】The blood profile and radiographic evidence of hy-perostosis indicating active folliculogenesis and the history of the bird laying a clutch of normal eggs 5 months prior to presentation suggest a normal female reproductive tract. The intracoelomic mass seen on radiographs likely does not involve the gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract, or reproductive tract. The cytologic examination of the sample aspirated from the coelomic mass indicates fatty tissue and supports a diagnosis of an intracoelomic lipoma, infiltrative lipoma, or lipo-sarcoma.﻿

【21】Summary

【22】The cockatoo was admitted for an intracoelomic exploratory surgery to investigate the nature of the in-tracoelomic mass and repair the hernia.

【23】The cockatoo was given 1.1 mg butorphanol, 0.33 mg midazolam, and 0.033 mg atropine intramuscularly as a preanesthetic treatment. Twenty minutes later, the bird was induced and maintained with isoflurane anesthesia following endotracheal intubation using a 4.0 mm tube. During the 1 hour and 24 minutes surgery, the bird was given 48.8 mL lactated Ringer's solution intravenously via a catheter placed in the basilic vein. The bird also received 5 mL of an esterified amylopectin-containing starch (hetastarch) intravenously during the procedure. Prior to recovery, the bird received 0.5 mg meloxicam intramuscularly and 1.0 mg butorphanol intramuscularly.

【24】The bird was placed in dorsal recumbency, and ra–diocautery was used to create a skin incision extending 2 cm from the caudal point of the keel to just cranial to the herniated area cranial to the cloaca. A body wall incision was made using radiocautery to expose the contents of the coelomic cavity. A large amount of yellow fat was found, occupying the majority of the coelomic cavity and encircling the ventriculus 删除33：<u></u>. A large amount of fat along with the duodenum was found herni-ated through the body wall. As much as possible, the fat was carefully removed using blunt dissection. A cloa–copexy using 5-0 polytrimethylene carbonate suture was used to close the body wall in a simple continuous pattern in the area of the hernia. The rest of the body wall was closed using the same material and pattern. The skin was closed using a 4-0 glycomer 631 suture in a simple interrupted pattern. A portion of the fatty tissue removed from the bird's coelomic cavity was submitted for histopathologic evaluation.

【26】The bird made an uneventful recovery from anesthesia and surgery and was placed in the critical care facility for close observation for 12 hours. She was treated with meloxicam (0.5 mg PO daily) postoperatively. Although she made no attempt to remove her sutures, she was sent home with an Elizabethan collar designed for birds in the event she pull at the sutures. At home the bird was less active than normal; however, she was eating and playing with her toys according to the client. The bird died 29 hours following her surgery possibly as a result of reperfusion problems or lipid embolism. No necropsy was performed.

【27】Histopathologic evaluation revealed sheets of normal adipocytes with moderate infiltration by lymphocytes, macrophages, multinucleated giant cells, and fewer heterophils. Frequently at the junction of the adipose lobules, there were areas of moderate degeneration and necrosis. A histologic diagnosis of necrotic lipoma was made.王磊
