【9】Case Presentation
-----------------

【10】A 26-year-old woman with hypopituitarism presents to the endocrine clinic to discuss optimal sex hormonal therapy. She had a history of a normal pubertal development with onset of menarche at age 12. Her menses were regular until age 20 when the intermenstrual interval shortened. She then experienced amenorrhea and galactorrhea associated with headaches and visual disturbance at age 21. At age 22 she was seen by her ophthalmologist who noted bitemporal hemianopsia, and an MRI revealed a large 4.2 × 3.4 × 3.5 cm sellar and suprasellar mass consistent with a pituitary macroadenoma. Hormonal evaluation demonstrated hyperprolactinemia 7000 ng/ml associated with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with low follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) 2 IU/L, luteinizing hormone (LH) 1 IU/L, and a prepubertal estradiol level 22 pg/mL. In addition, she had evidence of central hypothyroidism with a low thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) of 0.1 mIU/L and low free T4 of 0.6 ng/dL. Her remaining pituitary-adrenal axis testing was within normal limits with an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level of 15 pg/mL and morning cortisol of 10 μg/dL. The patient was placed on a dopamine agonist (DA), cabergoline 0.5 mg biweekly, and her prolactin level decreased to 500 ng/mL after 3 months. After 1 year, her prolactin level had decreased to 250 ng/mL, but did not normalize (goal <10) despite increasing the dose of the DA and spreading the dosing across the week for the potential rapid metabolism of the medication. Her menses did not return. MRI imaging demonstrated resolution of the intra- and suprasellar components of the mass with residual tumor in the bilateral cavernous sinuses. Surgery was considered but was not thought to be an option. Radiation therapy also was considered. She presented to the endocrine clinic to discuss optimal sex hormone therapy now and in the future.

【11】Introduction: Incidence, Prevalence, and Implications
-----------------------------------------------------

【12】The prevalence of sex hormone deficiency can be as high as 95% in patients presenting with sellar tumors, as well as after surgery or radiotherapy for sellar lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 1 , 2 \]</u>. Central hypogonadism is also prevalent for patients who have had cranial irradiation for other brain lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 2 \]</u>. Hyperprolactinemia directly secreted from the tumor, stalk compression, or medications is a common cause of central hypogonadism 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 3 , 4 \]</u>. There are limited studies of the long-term impact of sex steroid deficiency in patients with hypopituitarism. However, untreated gonadotropin deficiency is an independent factor adversely affecting mortality (hazard ratio, 1.86 \[99% CI, 1.15–2.45\]) 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 5 , 6 \]</u>. In contrast, sex steroid replacement has been associated with a significantly reduced standard mortality ratio (SMR) (1.42 \[99% CI, 0.97–2.07\] vs 2.97 \[99% CI, 2.13–4.13\]), although men and women were not considered separately 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 7 \]</u>. A more recent meta-analysis of 12 studies in the literature of 23,000 patients confirmed an increased excess mortality (SMR 1.55; 95% CI 1.14–2.11) 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 6 \]</u>. Risk factors included younger age at diagnosis, female gender, and hypogonadism as well as a diagnosis of craniopharyngioma, radiation therapy, transcranial therapy, and diabetes insipidus 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 6 \]</u>.

【13】Although there are no longitudinal studies in women with hypopituitarism and selective gonadotropin deficiency resulting in prolonged estrogen deficiency, premature ovarian insufficiency as a model of sex hormone deficiency is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 8 , 9 \]</u>. Studies suggest that bilateral oophorectomy without estrogen replacement before the age of 45 years increases cardiovascular mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 6 , 10 \]</u>. In patients with central hypogonadism, there is a reported SMR of 2.09 (95% CI, 0.94–4.65) in females with untreated gonadotropin deficiency compared to a SMR of 0.94 (95% CI, 0.35–2.49) in those with treated hypogonadism 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 11 \]</u>.

【14】Physiology and Pathophysiology
------------------------------

【15】The normal control of the reproductive axis in women is complex with changes during pubertal development to mature the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis and then across the menstrual cycle to control ovulatory cycles 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 12 , 13 \]</u>. The exact constellation of factors controlling the onset of puberty in the female is still not clear, but the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis in the human is activated postnatally and then repressed at about 6 months to allow childhood growth. The repression of the axis is mediated by neurotransmitters, but with onset of sexual maturation; kisspeptin neurons activate gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons in the hypothalamus to release GnRH in an episodic fashion 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 14 \]</u>. GnRH then travels down the median eminence of the pituitary to activate the transcription of the α subunit, FSHβ, and LHβ subunit genes to produce the functional heterodimeric gonadotropins, FSH and LH. These hormones then act at the ovary to produce androgens, estrogens, and progesterone 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 13 , 14 \]</u>.

【16】The first sign of puberty in girls is breast development under the control of estrogens, which increase glandular development 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 15 \]</u>. Only later in puberty, when progesterone is secreted from the corpus luteum, do the breasts mature fully with differentiation of ductules. This is important to remember when inducing pubertal development in a girl with congenital hypopituitarism or acquired before pubertal completion. Unlike males who have a fairly static GnRH-induced LH pulse pattern of secretion, in females the pattern must change across the monthly cycle to induce folliculogenesis, trigger ovulation, and then ensure normal luteal function 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 13 \]</u>. This pattern is mimicked when attempting to induce ovulation for pregnancy. When hormone therapy is considered to induce sexual maturation, estrogen alone for a period of time is used to optimally develop breast glandular development, and then progestin added intermittently after menses begin 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 16 \]</u>.

【17】In the adult woman with central hypogonadism because of pituitary disease, one may consider physiologic hormone therapy regimens with cyclic estrogen and progestin: however, often the patient can be placed on a low-dose oral contraceptive to ensure optimal estrogen replacement for convenience 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 17 , 18 \]</u>. Consideration of hormone therapy for the menopausal woman with hypopituitarism is similar to that of all symptomatic menopausal women based on individual risks and benefits 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 19 , 20 \]</u>.

【18】Diagnostic Testing and Monitoring
---------------------------------

【19】In the patient from the case presentation, there is the consideration that, if her prolactin is normalized , the reproductive axis may reactivate without intervention if the tumor has not caused additional compressive damage to the gonadotrophs. If the tumor is large and the prolactin decreasing slowly, replacement of the sex hormones with an oral contraceptive can be useful to maintain menstrual cyclicity, provide contraception, and provide target tissues with optimal estrogen action 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 5 , 21 \]</u>. If the prolactin level cannot be normalized, often libido is not improved with sex steroid replacement 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 3 \]</u>. Estrogen at high doses may increase prolactin levels, but effects of physiologic sex hormone replacement therapy or even low-dose oral contraceptive agents have minimal effects in clinical practice 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 3 \]</u>.

【20】Diagnostic testing in our patient would be to confirm low FSH, LH, and estradiol, inability to normalize the prolactin, treatment of the central hypothyroidism, and, if present, cortisol deficiency. No further monitoring of the reproductive axis hormone levels is needed in patients treated with oral contraceptives . If low-dose estrogen and progestin are chosen as a therapeutic intervention, then a transdermal or oral estradiol preparation can be administered, with the ability to target an estradiol level to the early to mid-follicular phase range. A progesterone component given intermittently is needed to ensure endometrial shedding, such as medroxyprogesterone 5 mg or micronized progesterone 200 mg on days 1–12 of each month. There are no studies of the long-term outcome of cyclic or continuous low-dose hormone therapy in young women compared to postmenopausal women given these regimens 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 22 \]</u>. Recent meta-analysis of effects of hormone therapy in menopausal women suggests that daily progestin increases the risk of breast cancer compared to intermittent or no progestin 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 23 \]</u>. Thus, this author’s recommendation is to use intermittent progestin days 1–12 each month rather than continuous dosing if this regimen is chosen instead of oral contraceptives for women with hypopituitarism in their reproductive years.

【21】Management of Sex Steroids in Women with Hypopituitarism
--------------------------------------------------------

【22】### Prepubertal/Pubertal Patients

【23】To induce pubertal development if the patient has congenital hypopituitarism or acquired during childhood, the goal is to replicate the timing and process of sex steroid action to develop secondary sexual characteristics 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 15 \]</u>. Therefore, one should not immediately prescribe an oral contraceptive or cyclic estrogen/progestin. If no breast development has occurred, estrogen alone is given in a “staircasing” escalation as occurs with normal pubertal development. The estrogen patches which come in doses from 0.025 to 0.1 mg weekly or biweekly can be useful to induce breast development. Oral estradiol can be used, but it has more of a peak and trough pattern, and one solution is to split it to twice daily dosing to mimic a more continuous level . The estradiol alone is given for 6–18 months until vaginal bleeding occurs . The onset of vaginal bleeding suggests endometrial stimulation has occurred and progestin, either natural progestin (Prometrium) 200 mg days 1–12, or medroxyprogesterone, 5 mg days 1–12 each month, is added to the continuous estrogen therapy . Once vaginal bleeding is occurring, many providers will switch the patient to a low-dose oral contraceptive. The packaging of the contraceptive facilitates compliance, and the adolescent can feel more like her peers who are on similar hormonal therapy, albeit for alternative reasons. Regular follow-up visits to a primary care or gynecologist are suggested for any woman on hormonal therapy or oral contraceptives especially when sexually active 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 18 , 19 \]</u>.

【26】### Adult Patients

【27】If the patient develops hypopituitarism after sexual maturation, as in our case presentation , the goal is to replace gonadal sex steroids in a convenient manner. Although some advocate continued use of physiologic sex hormone therapy, the cost of this therapy in comparison to oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) as well as convenience may alter the patient’s preference. Some have argued that oral estrogen may suppress the insulin-like growth factor (IGF-)1 response to growth hormone and might then attenuate metabolic responses to growth hormone therapy if the patient is on this regimen 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 5 \]</u>, although no head to head studies have been performed. Dosing of growth hormone in a patient with hypopituitarism may have to be adjusted in the presence of concomitant oral estrogen 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 24 \]</u>. Thyroid hormone levels may also need to be adjusted in women on any type of estrogen therapy and when this is discontinued after menopausal age.

【28】The goal is to maintain sex hormone levels to estrogen target tissues including the bones , the cardiovascular system, sexual function, cognition, and mental health . There have been no prospective controlled studies comparing risk/benefit of different types of hormonal replacement strategies. Obviously, if the patient has contraindications to oral contraceptives, then low-dose hormonal therapy would be the treatment of choice, usually with transdermal estrogen preparations .

【29】### Menopausal Patients

【30】As the woman with hypopituitarism enters her 40s, discussion of the type of hormonal therapy should be reconsidered . Smoking, hypertension, obesity, and diabetes may increase the risk of oral contraceptives as the mode of hormonal therapy and trigger the switch to a lower-dose sex hormone regimen which can be provided with oral or transdermal estrogens and cyclic progestin to protect the endometrium. If the woman has had a hysterectomy, only estrogen is administered. There are no specific studies that examine risk/benefit of menopausal hormone therapy in women with hypopituitarism. Discussion of individual risk factors for breast cancer, metabolic bone disease, cardiometabolic diseases and personal symptoms of hot flashes, painful intercourse, urinary frequency, sleep, and cognitive issues when not prescribed estrogen is an issue for the patient to review with her provider. The advantage of using the estrogen patches for hormonal therapy in the menopause is the availability of a stepwise decrease in dose potencies to taper hormonal therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 19 \]</u>. Thyroid replacement dosing for central hypothyroidism will often need to be decreased as a woman reduces and stops estrogen therapy. Routine health monitoring for all women with hypopituitarism should include control of hypertension, performance of lipid panel, hemoglobin A1c, mammograms, bone densitometry , and colonoscopies as recommended by health guidelines and individual risk based upon family history 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 19 \]</u>. The Endocrine Society and the International Consensus guidelines recommend against the routine prescribing of testosterone to women with hypopituitarism 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 25 , 26 \]</u>.

【31】Regarding the patient in the case presentation, we attempted to normalize her prolactin levels with various dosage regimens of cabergoline 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 27 \]</u> . We discussed the variable options for sex hormone therapy, and she chose to start oral contraceptive therapy with ethinyl estradiol 30 μg and norethindrone 1 mg daily. Her menses returned and were regular at monthly intervals lasting 3 days . Her thyroid hormone replacement dose was increased to target the free T4 to the top one-third of the normal range 通用删除6(英):<u>\[ 28 \]</u> . Retesting of her adrenal axis was performed due to effects of estrogen on serum cortisol levels. She will be referred to reproductive gynecology for induction of ovulation  when she desires fertility and will need to follow with an endocrinologist during and after her pregnancy as well as across her lifespan.苏锦恭
