【0】Question: A 26-year-old man with hepatitis C is being treated medically while he awaits liver transplantation. One of the drugs he is taking causes him to have periodic fevers and chills and a sense of depression that he did not have prior to treatment. Which of the following drugs most likely is responsible for this patient’s adverse effects?

【1】> (A) Intravenous immunoglobulin

【2】> (B) Lamivudine

【3】> (C) Pegylated interferon

【4】> (D) Ribavirin

【5】> (E) Tumor necrosis factor-α

【6】 Answer: The correct answer is C . Pegylated interferon is a cytokine derivative that improves the body’s antiviral response. It is used in the treatment of HBV and HCV. Adverse effects of interferon therapy include a flu-like reaction that manifests as episodic fevers and chills, as well as occasional profound depression. As a result, interferon is contraindicated in severely depressed or suicidal patients. Although interferon is not a cure for hepatitis, it is recommended to slow the progression of cirrhotic liver disease in some patients. Pegylated interferon is a longer-acting form of interferon.  
Answer A is incorrect . IV immunoglobulin is an engineered antibody that is used to clear the serum of protein products. It often is used in treatment of autoimmune diseases such as Guillain-Barré syndrome. Adverse effects include flu-like reaction and anaphylactic reaction.  
Answer B is incorrect . Lamivudine is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor used in the treatment of HIV and HBV. Its principal adverse effect is hepatotoxicity.  
Answer D is incorrect . Ribavirin is an antiviral drug used in the treatment of HCV, respiratory syncytial virus, and, occasionally, other viral illnesses. It is not associated with depression or a flu-like reaction.  
Answer E is incorrect . Tumor necrosis factor-α is a cytokine involved in the antiviral and antitumor response. It is not used currently as a treatment for HCV.苏锦恭
