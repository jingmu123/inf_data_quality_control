【0】CASE 92: FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION
Sayida, 21 years old, has recently arrived in the UK with her husband and 2-year-old daughter from their home country, Sierra Leone. The family left Sierra Leone because of war and  删除换行1 continuing political unrest and are seeking asylum in the UK. Sayida is 10 weeks pregnant  删除换行1 when she attends the antenatal clinic for her first booking appointment, accompanied by  删除换行1 her husband and a middle-aged female relative of her husband. The latter explains that she  删除换行1 has come along to act as chaperone and interpreter because Sayida speaks no English and  删除换行1 her husband very little. During initial assessment it transpires that a friend already living in  删除换行5 London has told Sayida about the African Well Woman Clinic (AWWC) and Sayida’s husband has telephoned for an appointment. Through the interpreter Sayida explains that she  删除换行1 had problems with her first pregnancy and during the birth, and her friend has told her that  删除换行1 the AWWC would be able to help her with this and ‘difficulties’ she has had since the birth  删除换行1 of her daughter.

【1】Clinical examination by a female genital mutilation (FGM) public health specialist reveals  删除换行1 that Sayida has FGM III and is presenting with symptoms consistent with problems associated with urinary tract infection and the menstrual cycle.

【2】Questions

【3】• What is FGM?

【4】• What are the laws in the UK regarding the practice of FGM?

【5】• Should a competent adult be able to consent to the procedure?

【6】• What is cultural relativism?

【7】ANSWER 92
Across the globe the controversy of FGM has ignited arguments by human rights activists,  删除换行1 healthcare professionals and feminists for nearly half a century. In 2000 the World Health  删除换行5 Organisation (WHO) defined FGM as ‘all procedures which involve partial or total removal  删除换行1 of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs whether for cultural or any other non-therapeutic reasons’.
 WHO classification of FGM

【8】• Type I: excision of the prepuce, with or without excision of part or all of the clitoris

【9】• Type II: excision of the clitoris with partial or total excision of the labia minora

【10】• Type III: excision of part or all of the external genitalia and stitching/narrowing of  删除换行1 the vaginal opening, also known as infibulation

【11】• Type IV: unclassified. This includes pricking, piercing or incising of the clitoris  删除换行1 and/or labia, stretching of the clitoris and/or labia, cauterisation by burning of the  删除换行1 clitoris and surrounding tissue.

【12】In many countries, FGM is accepted as the norm – an expected part of the customary practice  删除换行1 of many local communities. For many women FGM is a fact of life, a pain that must be borne  删除换行1 because they must conform to social expectation. People with little or no knowledge, skill or  删除换行1 training in female anatomy and surgical techniques perform FGM. It is usually performed  删除换行1 on girls between the ages of 4 and 13 years, but sometimes it is done in newborns or on  删除换行1 young women before marriage or pregnancy. It is often performed in unhygienic conditions  删除换行1 and without anaesthesia. Despite worldwide attempts to end the ancient tradition, every year  删除换行1 millions of women and girls are being ‘circumcised’. There are three main arguments against  删除换行1 the practice of FGM:

【13】• It is a dangerous tradition with horrific medical consequences.

【14】• It is primarily performed on girls who cannot consent to the procedure.

【15】• It is a misogynistic practice carried out in patriarchal societies to repress female  删除换行1 sexuality.

【16】Ethical issues

【17】In a multicultural environment, it is important to respect others’ religious and cultural  删除换行1 beliefs and value systems. Many of the arguments centred on FGM are tied up in an intricate  删除换行1 web of ethical issues with the main conflict arising between cultural and individual rights.
Opponents of FGM argue against the practice on the ethical basis that some human rights  删除换行1 are fundamental and supersede differences in cultural morality. The counterargument to this  删除换行1 is that different moral codes are applied by different cultures and that these should not be  删除换行1 criticised by people who do not have an intimate understanding of that culture. In bioethics  删除换行1 this argument is described as cultural relativism.

【18】Relativism is a strain of ethical theory that holds that there are no absolute truths or morals. Mackie, a contemporary philosopher, cites that the proof of this is the existence of  删除换行1 diverse moral values, which have changed greatly over time and culture. Cultural relativism  删除换行1 argues that morals are merely socially approved habits, and the moral code that one culture  删除换行1 follows does not have to be the same as that of another culture. It holds that the morals of  删除换行1 other cultures should not be subjected to criticism from the subjective view of an outsider.
It  encourages diverse cultural expression and harmonious living in pluralistic societies  删除换行1 because it fosters an attitude of acceptance of other cultures.删除个例：<u>Faith, Values and Culture</u>
A strong example of the ethical hypocrisy of criticism of FGM and of moral double standards  删除换行1 is reflected in the law concerning it. The UK and other countries have legislation making it a  删除换行1 crime to ‘excise, infibulate or otherwise mutilate the whole or any part of the labia majora or  删除换行1 labia minora or clitoris of another person’ 删除10：<u>(Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003, Section 1)</u>.
Yet in these same countries, genital cosmetic surgery in terms of piercings or labioplasty is  删除换行1 rarely criticised and has not resulted in prosecution.

【19】Legal issues

【20】In 1985 the Prohibition of Female Circumcision Act was introduced due to pressure from  删除换行1 global conventions to criminalise the practice amid fears that FGM was occurring in Britain  删除换行1 by African immigrants who had fled their own countries to escape from war and poverty.This Act made it a criminal offence to circumcise any girl or woman living in the UK no  删除换行1 matter what her nationality, religion or culture. In 2003 this Act was repealed by the Female  删除换行5 Genital Mutilation Act 2003, which was introduced to close a loophole in the law. It prevented 

【21】British inhabitants from taking their children away on ‘holidays’ to be circumcised. This is  删除换行1 an unusual step to take since crimes usually committed abroad are not liable to prosecution  删除换行1 under the British penal system.
Section 6 of the 2003 Act clarifies that no distinction is made between FGM being performed  删除换行1 on minors or competent adults and prosecution can occur no matter in which country FGM  删除换行5 is performed. Note that the 2003 Act specifically forbids mutilation ‘required as a matter of  删除换行1 custom or ritual’, even if not performing it may have adverse mental health consequences.
The Act also extended the prison sentence from 5 years to 14 years, demonstrating once again  删除换行1 how serious a crime this is considered to be in the UK.

【22】There are several defences to FGM:

【23】No offence is committed by a registered medical practitioner who performs a surgical  删除换行1 operation necessary for a girl’s physical or mental health. Nor is an offence committed by  删除换行1 a registered midwife or a person undergoing a course of training with a view to becoming  删除换行1 a registered medical practitioner or registered midwife, but only if the operation is on a girl  删除换行1 who is in any stage of labour, or has just given birth, and is for purposes connected with  删除换行1 the labour or birth.

【24】Crown Prosecution Service, Female Genital Mutilation Guidance
Despite FGM being illegal since 1985, there have been no successful prosecutions. In a  删除换行1 recent landmark case, the Crown Prosecution Service charged a trainee obstetrician with  删除换行1 the crime of re-infibulation following the need for an episiotomy in a woman who had  删除换行1 undergone circumcision in Somalia at the age of 6. The jury cleared the doctor very quickly  删除换行1 and there was a public outcry that this attempted prosecution was detracting from the real  删除换行1 crime of circumcision and making midwives and obstetricians vulnerable. In comparison,  删除换行5 France has had over 100 successful prosecutions and has a zero tolerance policy on FGM, to  删除换行1 the extent that girls who are taken abroad during school term time and are at risk of being  删除换行1 mutilated are examined first, the parents are warned about the law and grave consequences  删除换行1 and then they are re-examined on their return to ensure they remain intact. The Serious 

【25】Crime Act 2015 删除10：<u>(by making changes to the 2003 Act)</u> now imposes a duty on healthcare professionals, teachers and social care workers, to notify the police when, in the course of their  删除换行1 work, they discover that an act of female genital mutilation appears to have been carried out  删除换行1 on a girl who is under 18. Such a notification would not breach any duty of confidence or 256 删除换行1 other restriction on the disclosure of information. A court can make a protection order to  删除换行1 protect a girl against the commission of FGM.

【26】Child protection issues
Healthcare professionals have an obligation to safeguard girls who are at risk of FGM and  删除换行1 must report cases to the child protection team. Refugees, asylum seekers and migrants to the  删除换行5 UK need to be given information about their health and the UK legal and child protection  删除换行1 issues regarding FGM. Sensitivity is an essential component of any interaction with patients  删除换行1 and their families. Wherever possible the aim must be to work in partnership with parents  删除换行1 and families to protect children through parents’ awareness of the harm caused to the child.
A girl may be considered to be at risk if it is known that older girls in the family have been subjected to the procedure. Pre-pubescent girls aged 7–10 years are the main subjects, although  删除换行1 the practice has been reported among babies. If any agency is informed that a girl has been or  删除换行1 may be subjected to these practices, a referral must be made to social services in accordance  删除换行1 with child protection procedures. In planning any intervention it is important to consider  删除换行1 cultural factors because culture and cultural identity are frequently given as the reason that  删除换行5 FGM is performed, and any intervention is more likely to be successful if it involves workers  删除换行1 from, or with a detailed knowledge of, the community concerned.

【27】Female genital mutilation is different from other child protection issues since it is a oneoff event of physical abuse (albeit one that may have grave permanent sexual, physical and  删除换行1 emotional consequences). A girl who has already been genitally mutilated should not usually  删除换行1 be registered on the child protection register, unless additional protection concerns exist,  删除换行1 although she should be offered counselling and medical help. Consideration must be given to  删除换行1 any other female siblings at risk.

【28】Key Points

【29】• In the UK, FGM is illegal. But despite this it continues to be practised due to the  删除换行1 growing number of refugees and asylum seekers from countries where FGM is  删除换行1 widespread.

【30】• People who might perform FGM on their children should be educated sensitively  删除换行1 about the dangers of the practice and its illegality.

【31】• In a multicultural environment it is important to respect others’ religious and cultural beliefs and value systems, but some human rights are considered universal.删除个例：<u>Faith, Values and Culture</u>王磊
