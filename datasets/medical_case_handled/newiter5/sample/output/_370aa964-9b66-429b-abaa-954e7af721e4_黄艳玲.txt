【0】Question: A 51-year-old man with a lengthy history of medication-dependent reflux esophagitis sees his physician for an annual physical examination. Laboratory tests reveal a blood gastrin level three times the upper limit of normal. His physician expresses concern that the patient is at risk of developing atrophic gastritis. Which of the following medications is this patient most likely taking?

【1】> (A) Aluminum hydroxide

【2】> (B) Bismuth

【3】> (C) Cimetidine

【4】> (D) Misoprostol

【5】> (E) Omeprazole

【6】 Answer: The correct answer is E . Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that works by covalently binding, and irreversibly inactivating the H <sup class="calibre40">+ </sup> /K <sup class="calibre40">+ </sup> /ATPase on the luminal surface of the gastric parietal cell. Gastrin levels are regulated by a feedback loop. Intragastric acidity stimulates D-cells in the gastric antrum to release somatostatin, which works in a paracrine fashion, binding to G-cells in the gastric antrum and inhibiting gastrin release. PPIs will effectively raise the intragastric pH so that gastrin levels rise two- to four-fold. Omeprazole is associated with atrophic gastritis due to hypergastrinemia. It may also be associated with carcinoid tumors, headaches, and GI disturbances.  
Answer A is incorrect . Aluminum hydroxide is an antacid that is not absorbed and thus does not cause systemic adverse effects. It is associated with constipation and hypophosphatemia.  
Answer B is incorrect . Bismuth binds to ulcers, providing a physical protective barrier. It has no known adverse effects.  
Answer C is incorrect . Cimetidine is an H2 \-antagonist and is associated with headache, confusion, thrombocytopenia, and inhibition of the CYP450 system. Inhibition of the proton pumps by PPIs such as omeprazole has a greater effect on the intragastric acidity that regulates the gastrin feedback loop than antagonizing the H2 \-receptors by drugs such as cimetidine.  
Answer D is incorrect . Misoprostol is a prostaglandin E1 analog that can be used to prevent NSAID-induced peptic ulcers. It is also used as a medical abortifacient in many countries and is therefore strictly contraindicated in pregnant women.黄艳玲
