【0】41 HOMONYMOUS HEMIANOPIA

【1】INSTRUCTION

【2】Examine this patient’s eyes.

【3】Examine this patient’s visual fields.

【4】SALIENT FEATURES

【5】History

【6】● Patient bumps into things on one side and may have a history of traffic accidents where one side of the car is damaged without the patient realizing.

【7】Patient may insist that they have one 'bad' eye (remember blindness in one eye causes impairment of perceiving distances but the normal eye will provide a full field of vision on both sides and hence patient will not bump into objects).

【8】Reading difficulty (suggests that the visual defect splits the midline： if the defect is on the right side， patient is unable to scan along the line to the next word and hence reading is almost impossible， whereas when the defect is on the left side the patient cannot find the beginning of the next line).

【9】Determine whether the patient is aware of his/her defect (if the patient is aware of the visual defect， it is likely the defect ‘splits’ the macula and bisects the central field； if the patient is unaware and bumps into things， then the defect is either macular sparing or an attention hemianopia).

【10】Examination

【11】·Homonymous hemianopia： examination includes：

【12】· testing for an attention field defect using both hands of the examiner and asking the patient to determine which finger is moving

【13】●testing the whole field in each eye using a white hat pin

【14】●re-evaluation of the field in each eye to determine whether there is macular sparing or macular splitting using a hat pin. If you are unable to determine， then tell the patient that you would like to do formal fieldtestingwith a tangent screen or usinga perimeter.

【15】Proceed as follows：

【16】● Check the visual acuity； examine the fundus.

【17】Tell the examiner that you would like to do a full neurological examination to look for an underlyingcause： stroke， intracranial tumnour.

【18】Remember： Homonymous hemianopic visual field defects with normal visual acuity are the hallmark of a unilateral retrochiasmal lesion.

【19】DIAGNOSIS

【20】This patient has a homonymous hemianopia (lesion) for which I would like to determine the aetiology， such as a stroke or tumour.

【21】ADVANCED-LEVEL QUESTIONS

【22】Where is the lesion?

【23】The lesion is in the optic tract and beyond (visual acuity is intact when the macula is spared). Figure 41.1 shows the sites of the lesions and the visual field effects.

|  | Site  | Type of homonymous hemianopia  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1  | Optic nerve  | Unilateral amaurosis  |
| 2  | Lateral optic chiasm  | Grossly incongruous， contralateral  |
| 3  | Central optic chiasm  | Bitemporal hemianopia  |
| 4  | Optic tract  | Incongruous， incomplete  |
| 5  | Temporal lobe  | Superior quadrantic defect， congruouspartial or complete (contralateral)  |
| 6  | Posterior parietal lobe  | Inferior quadrantic defect， congruouspartial or complete  |

【25】42 Bitemporal hemianopia

|  | Site  | Type of homonymous hemianopia  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 7  | Complete parieto-occipital interruptionof the optic radiation  | Complete congruous homonymoushemianopia with shift of foveal point， oftensparing central vision  |
| 8  | Incomplete damageto the visual cortex  | Congruous homonymous scotomas，usually encroaching at least acutely oncentral vision  |

【27】What further investigations would you do?

【28】●Formal field testing： perimetry is particularly important if the patient holds a driver's licence

【29】MRI or CT.黄艳玲
