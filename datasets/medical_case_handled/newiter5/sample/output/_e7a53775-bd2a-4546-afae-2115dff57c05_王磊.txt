【2】Introduction

【3】Collagen is an abundant protein found in the extracellular matrix of animals. You probably have heard about collagen in the context of tendons and skin. Collagen forms a stiff fiber that is made up of three long polypeptide chains that assemble into a twisted helix, stabilized in part by hydrogen bond formation between the side chains (R groups) of proline. The enzyme prolyl hydroxylase reacts with the proline in collagen to help to promote proper folding of the triple helix inside the RER. Activity of prolyl hydroxylase requires ascorbic acid , better known as vitamin C, as a cofactor.

【4】Collagen is synthesized and secreted from fibroblast and osteoblast cells. Because collagen is destined to exit the cell, translation of preprocollagen polypeptide mRNAs is targeted at the RER. After entering the RER the signal sequence is removed and initial folding of individual polypeptide strands occur. Proper alignment of the three polypeptides is made possible by the presence of globular propeptides located at the amino and carboxyl-terminal ends of each polypeptide. The final product is a 300 nm long microfibril of procollagen ( PC ). Procollagen is then transported from the RER to the Golgi complex and eventually out of the cell. Misfolded microfibrils are unable to travel to the Golgi and will accumulate inside the RER. Only after PC has left the cell do PC peptidases cleave off the globular propeptides, allowing the microfibrils to assemble into fibrils that finally assemble into collagen fibers forming an important part of the extracellular matrix.

【5】▪ What is the difference between a “polypeptide” and a “protein?”

【6】▪ Conduct a search for images or diagrams of the molecular structure of collagen microfibrils and fibers. Can you find micrographs of collagen as part of the extracellular matrix.

【7】▪ Examine the chemical structure of the amino acid proline. Explain why proline is capable of participating in the formation of a hydrogen bond.

【8】▪ Scurvy is a disease caused by lack of vitamin C in a person’s diet. Some of the symptoms include bleeding of the gums and tooth loss, inability of wounds to heal, and joint pain. Suggest why lack of vitamin C might cause these symptoms?

【9】▪ How do the mRNAs for secretory proteins get targeted at the RER?

【10】▪ What was the likely function of the ”pre” portion of the protein preprocollagen?

【11】▪ Predict what would happen if the globular propeptides were removed from PC while it was still inside the cell?

【12】Background
----------

【13】The endomembrane system of a eukaryotic cell consists of a series of membrane-bound organelles that can be thought of as “connected” by the movement of proteins and lipids between them. Proteins, like PC, that must be exported out of the cell are synthesized on the RER, travel through the individual cisternae or stacks of the Golgi complex, and finally exit the cell at the plasma membrane. Two models have been proposed to explain the transport of proteins through the Golgi complex. The vesicular transport model proposes that Golgi cisternae are stable membrane compartments. Each cisterna contains a characteristic set of enzymes that function to modify proteins as they pass through the compartment. Based on this model, proteins are carried forward from one compartment to the next in small, membrane-bound transport vesicles. In contrast, the cisternal maturation model states that Golgi cisternae are dynamic organelles that are constantly being formed from the RER and that change their function or “mature” with time. Proteins remain within a Golgi cisterna and are modified as a result of changes in the population of enzymes. According to this model a cis Golgi compartment “matures” into a medial Golgi cisterna and a medial Golgi compartment “matures” into a trans Golgi cisterna due to the backward transport of enzymes between the cisternae.

【14】Cisternal maturation helps to explain how very large protein aggregates can move through the Golgi complex. Proteins like PC are too large (300 nm) to fit into a transport vesicle (50–90 nm) and yet these proteins are glycosylated just like the smaller, soluble proteins that are known to travel in transport vesicles. The cisternal maturation model predicts that protein aggregates would remain in the lumen of a single Golgi cisterna as that membrane compartment matures from cis to trans . The synthesis and transport of PC by chick embryonic fibroblast cells was examined in this case study with the goal of testing the validity of the cisternal maturation model.

【16】▪ Create a diagram that illustrates the two models of protein transport through the Golgi complex.

【19】Methods
-------

【20】### Primary culture of chick embryo fibroblast cells

【21】Primary cultures of fibroblast cells were isolated from a 15-day-old chicken embryo tendons (ET) by incubation in the presence of 3 mg/mL collagenase in tissue culture media. Cells were harvested from the media by filtering through cheesecloth followed by centrifugation. The fibroblast cell pellet was resuspended in tissue culture media and plated into glass chamber slides coated with 30 μg/mL fibronectin. Cells were incubated for 18 h at 37°C before use in any experiments.

【22】### Immunofluorescence

【23】Cultured ET fibroblast cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. The cells were rinsed with buffer and incubated with antibodies that recognize the carboxy-terminal domain of PC (LF68 antibody) and the Golgi-specific integral membrane protein giantin . The cells were then incubated with fluorescent-labeled secondary antibodies.

【24】### Immunoelectron microscopy

【25】ET fibroblast cells were fixed and permeabilized as described previously. The cells were incubated with a monoclonal antibody specific to the folded form of PC (hCL通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>) followed by incubation with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody. In the presence of 0.001% hydrogen peroxide (H <sub>2 </sub> O <sub>2 </sub> ), the HRP enzyme catalyze a reaction with 0.075% 3,3’-diaminobenzidine tetrachloride (DAB-HCl) to form an insoluble precipitate that appears as a dark electron-dense region in the electron micrograph.

【26】### PC “wave” protocols

【27】Movement of PC from the RER through the Golgi was synchronized using two different protocols. Both protocols relied on the ability of the iron-chelating compound 2,2’-dipyridyl (DPD) to inhibit the proper folding of PC resulting in the retention of unfolded PC in the RER. The “exiting wave” protocol followed the movement of the population of PC proteins already present in the Golgi. ET fibroblast cells were treated with 0.3 mM DPD for 0–60 min, fixed, and reacted with a monoclonal antibody to folded PC. Since DPD inhibits the folding of PC, the only proteins that the antibody can react with are proteins that had already left the RER. The “incoming wave” protocol also used 0.3 mM DPD to block the exit of PC from the RER; however, in this protocol the cells were incubated in the DPD until the PC proteins already present in the lumen of the Golgi had exited the cell. Washing out the DPD and supplementing the media with ascorbic acid (vitamin C) allowed PC to fold properly and exit the RER as a single wave of protein. Localization of the folded PC was achieved using the same fold-specific antibody. Cis to trans polarity of the Golgi in both protocols relied on the presence of clathrin-coated vesicles as markers for the trans Golgi compartment.

【28】### Assay of PC release

【29】Cells were grown as described previously and treated with DPD following either the “exiting wave” or “incoming wave” protocols. Tissue culture media was collected at time points after the addition (exiting wave) or removal (incoming wave) of 0.3 mM DPD. Fresh media were added to the cells following each collection. Proteins present in the media were precipitated using 10% trichloroacetic (TCA) acid and were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using a polyclonal antibody to PC (Sp1.D8). The intensity of the stained bands was quantitated using image analysis software.

【49】▪ Predict whether the time required for PC aggregates to move through the Golgi complex, the transit time , will be different in cells under the “exiting wave” protocol versus cells under the “incoming wave” protocol.

【50】▪ Use the graph in Figure 8.3.2 a to determine the time it takes for the number of PC aggregates to decrease by half in the cis and trans Golgi cisternae. Estimate the transit time across the Golgi complex as the difference between these two values.

【51】▪ Use the graph in Figure 8.3.2 b to determine the time it takes for the number of PC aggregates to increase by half in the cis and trans Golgi cisternae. Calculate the transit time based on the “incoming wave” protocol.
