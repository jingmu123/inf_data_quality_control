【1】TRIMESTER

【2】History

【3】A 31-year-old woman presents during the 35th week of her first pregnancy. She is very  删除换行1 anxious about the development of extremely itchy ‘lines’ over her abdomen over the last  删除换行1 two days. She is otherwise well with an unremarkable antenatal history to date. Her dates  删除换行1 are confirmed on ultrasound scanning. She has no previous history of skin problems.

【4】Examination

【5】She has striking erythematous, linear, urticated lesions in a concentric and, in some areas,  删除换行1 coalescing distribution over her pregnancy-distended abdomen 删除33：<u></u>. The eruption  删除换行1 corresponds with the striae distensae and there is sparing of the umbilicus. She has a  删除换行1 few similar lesions over her upper thighs. She is normotensive and the remainder of her  删除换行1 examination is normal. It is of note that according to her antenatal notes she has gained  删除换行1 5 kg since her last antenatal check 3 weeks ago. Urine dipstick is negative.

【7】Questions

【8】• What is this eruption?

【9】• What other diagnoses would you  删除换行1 consider?

【10】• What are the implications for the baby?
ANSWER 32

【11】This presentation with a very pruritic eruption beginning in the third trimester of the  删除换行1 first pregnancy and arising within the striae distensae (sparing the umbilicus) is typical of pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy (PUPPP), also referred to as  删除换行1 toxic erythema of pregnancy or polymorphic eruption of pregnancy. Over a few days the  删除换行1 eruption can become more widespread involving the trunk and extremities; less commonly, annular or polycyclic lesions develop. It is thought that maternal weight gain may  删除换行1 somehow precipitate the lesions. Anecdotally it is more often associated with male fetus  删除换行1 pregnancy and the risk of PUPPP seems to be higher with multiple gestation pregnancies.
It is important to consider other pregnancy-specific pruritic eruptions (such as pemphigoid gestationis, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy) as well as common eruptions  删除换行1 unrelated to pregnancy (such as urticaria, drug eruptions, viral exanthems, scabies). A  删除换行5 comprehensive examination for evidence of scabies is indicated as well as investigations  删除换行1 to rule out pemphigoid gestationis (skin biopsy for direct immunofluoresence studies).

【12】Although PUPPP can be very symptomatic and consequently distressing for the affected  删除换行1 mother, the eruption itself is not thought to have any adverse effects on the fetus.
Management is therefore based on symptomatic relief with cool baths, light clothing,  删除换行1 emollients and topical corticosteroids, as well as reassurance.

【13】 KEY POINTS

【14】• Pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy (PUPPP) is a benign pregnancy  删除换行1 dermatosis which usually arises in the third trimester.

【15】• The most distressing aspect of the eruption is the associated pruritus. It is otherwise  删除换行1 self-limited with no adverse effects on fetal outcome.

【16】• The pathomechanism of the eruption is unknown but it is more commonly observed  删除换行1 in association with recent, sudden weight gain, male fetus and multiple gestational  删除换行1 pregnancies.焦瀚远
