【0】Question: A 4-year-old boy with a history of mental retardation and seizures is brought to the physician with a three-month history of worsening shortness of breath. During physical examination, the physician notices numerous acne-like papules on the patient’s face. Echocardiography shows significant left ventricular outflow obstruction. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis for this patient’s heart condition?

【1】> (A) Dilated cardiomyopathy

【2】> (B) Lipoma

【3】> (C) Myxoma

【4】> (D) Rhabdomyoma

【5】> (E) Transposition of the great vessels

【6】 Answer: The correct answer is D . Tuberous sclerosis is a genetic condition (autosomal dominant) characterized by nodular proliferation of multinucleated atypical astrocytes. These form tubers, which are found throughout the cerebral cortex and periventricular areas. The classic triad, which is manifest in only the most severe of cases, consists of seizures, mental retardation, and facial angiofibromas (also known as adenoma sebaceum). Half of patients with tuberous sclerosis develop rhabdomyomas, primary tumors of cardiac muscle that, although benign, may compromise cardiac function, especially of the atrioventricular valves. Tuberous sclerosis is also notable for a link to angiomyolipomas of the kidney.  
Answer A is incorrect . Dilated cardiomyopathy is often idiopathic. It involves four-chamber hypertrophy and dilation, and eventually heart failure. This condition is not associated with tuberous sclerosis. Note that hypertrophic cardiomyopathy also causes ventricular outflow obstruction and is often responsible for sudden death in young athletes.  
Answer B is incorrect . Lipomas, like rhabdomyomas, are capable of obstruction. These can create ball-valve obstructions and are most often located in the left ventricle, right atrium, or atrial septum. However, in conjunction with the history suggesting tuberous sclerosis, lipoma is a less likely diagnosis.  
Answer C is incorrect . Myxomas, like rhabdomyomas, are capable of obstruction. However, these are seen in adults and are often located in the atria.  
Answer E is incorrect . Transposition of the great vessels is a situation in which the pulmonary trunk arises from the left ventricle and the aorta arises from the right ventricle. This arrangement is incompatible with life, and a compensatory anomaly such as a patent ductus arteriosus is necessary.黄艳玲
