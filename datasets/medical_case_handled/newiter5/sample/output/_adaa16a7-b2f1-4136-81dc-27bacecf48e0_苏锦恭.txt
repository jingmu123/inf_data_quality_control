【0】14.1 A 60-year-old man with past medical history of BPH presents to you with gross hematuria for 1 day. He states this has never happened before and denies strenuous exercise. Upon further questioning he does reveal that 2 days ago he had a bladder catheterization to evaluate his postvoid residual. He denies smoking， family history of cancers， or chemical exposures. Which of the following is the most appropriate management at this time?

【1】A. Counsel the patient on the high likelihood of gross hematuria after a urologic procedure and that this will likely subside. Let him know no test is required today.

【2】B. Do a urine dipstick first. If positive then proceed to urinalysis with microscopy and have the patient return in a few weeks for a repeat UA with microscopy.

【3】C. Discuss with the patient the high likelihood of malignancy with gross hematuria especially given his age and past history and recommend imaging upper and lower urinary tracts.

【4】D. Tell him that he likely needs urine cytology today to rule out malignancy.

【5】14.2 A 54-year-old postmenopausal woman with past medical history of hyper-tension is incidentally found to have significant microscopic hematuria on a UA that was done as part of her annual hypertension laboratory tests. She denies dysuria， gross hematuria， fevers， chills， and nausea/ vomiting. Her physical examination is negative for suprapubic tenderness and flank pain. What would be the next best step in the management of this patient?

【6】A.Repeat UA with microscopy in 3 months at her next follow-up visit for hypertension.

【7】B. Perform a urine culture and if positive， treat immediately. Repeat UA posttreatment.

【8】C.Order renal function testing to rule out medical renal disease as an etiology.

【9】D. Repeat UA with microscopy in 6 weeks.

【10】14.33 A 65-year-old man with past medical history of hypertension， coronary artery disease， chronic kidney disease (CKD)， and a pacemaker presents to your office with complaint ofdark urine"for many weeks now. He states he has been evaluated by several other physicians who had done“several tests”that all came back negative. He states he has never had any imaging done and would like you to“take a look at what is going on in there?Upon accessing his medical records you see that he has already had several UA with microscopy that were all positive for microscopic hematuria， renal function testing， which is significant for elevated BUN and creatinine and decreased GFR， and nega-tive urine cultures. At this time， what would be the most appropriate imaging modality and management for this patient?

【11】A1.Counsel the patient against imaging at this time as any imaging may worsen his CKD.

【12】B. Order magnetic resonance urography (MRU) as the patient is unable to undergo CT urography given his renal insufficiency， along with an urgent urology referral.

【13】C.Order a combined renal ultrasound and retrograde pyelogram for maxi-mum visualization of upper urinary tract， along with an urgent urology referral.

【14】D. Order urine cytology and urine markers as these are the least invasive test of choice at this time.

【15】ANSWERS

【16】14.11B. Although it is very likely that the patients hematuria is secondary to the recent urologic procedure， it is not a good practice to simply assume the cause and not do appropriate initial evaluation for hematuria， like one would for any patient with that chief complaint. The initial step in this case would be to do a urine dipstick， which if positive in office， would warrant a UA with microscopy. If this shows 3 or more RBCs per HPF， one would immediately go to thorough workup. However， if UA with microscopy shows fewer than3 RBCs per HPF， the patient should be asked to return in 6 weeks for a repeat. It is appropriate to discuss with the patient that his gross hematu-ria， given his lack of risk factors for malignancy， is most likely caused by the recent bladder catheterization； however， as stated earlier， this is not a reason to dismiss further evaluation. Since there is a probable cause for this patient’s hematuria， one would not immediately begin workup to rule out malignancy. Certainly， if his gross hematuria continues after several weeks， it would be imperative to conduct further evaluation.

【17】14.2I D. This patient does not have signs or symptoms of a UTI and additional workup looking for an infection is not going to change management， as asymptomatic bacteriuria need not be treated except in pregnancy. As per the current guidelines， this patient needs a repeat UA with microscopy in 6 weeks before beginning workup to rule out medical renal disease. A 3-month inter val between repeat UA testing is not an appropriate interval.

【18】14.3删除38：<u>(</u>C. This patient has two simultaneous contraindications to imaging modali-ties preferred in the workup of microscopic hematuria. Due to his renal insufficiency he should not get a CT urography， and due to his pacemaker， he should not undergo MRI/MRU. For this reason， the next best imaging modality would have to be done， a renal ultrasound， which when combined with a retrograde pyelogram would provide maximum information about the upper urinary tracts. This would have to be done with a concurrent urology referral. Urine cytology and urine markers， although noninvasive， are not cur-rently recommended in the routine evaluation of microscopic hematuria.
CLINICALPEARLS

【19】Hematuria in adults should always be evaluated. If no source is found on a thorough initial workup，patients should be followed for at least 3 years to monitor for an underlying condition. In every case ofa first-time microscopic hematuria， a repeat urinalysis with microscopy is required at 6--wWeeek interval before any other manage-ment is done.
