【20】B.Clostridium difficile colitis

【21】C.Medication side effect

【23】ANSWERS

【24】38.1 C. There is a predominance of anaerobes in bacterial vaginosis. The vaginal pH in BV is usually>4.5， and the discharge is homogenous. The most com-mon symptom is a fishy or"musty”odor when introduced to an alkaline sub-stance (ie，10%KOH， semen， or menses). Clue cells are found on microscopy. BV is associated with genital tract infection， such as endometritis， pelvic inflammatory disease， and pregnancy complications， such as preterm delivery and PPROM. Frothy discharge， normal to acidic pH， and flagellated organ-isms are more typical of trichomoniasis.

【25】38.2 C. After antibiotic therapy， candidal organisms often proliferate and may induce an overt infection. The mechanism is likely that the lactobacilli are eliminated by the antibiotic， allowing overgrowth of yeast. Treatment of can-didal vulvovaginitis is oral fluconazole or imidazole cream. Metronidazole is used to treat BV and T. vaginalis. Patients should be instructed to avoid alco-hol while taking metronidazole to avoid a disulfiram reaction. Erythromycin may be used in the treatment of syphilis in nonpregnant women allergic to penicillin. Clindamycin is typically used in conjunction with gentamicin in the treatment of infections requiring broad-spectrum antibiotics，necessitat-ing anaerobic coverage (ie，postpartum endomyometritis). H ydrocortisone is most commonly indicated for severe allergic reactions.

【26】38.3B. Trichomonas vaginalis is a hardy organism and may be isolated from a wet surface up to 6 hours after inoculation. The organisms difficulty to eradicate is the reason that therapy requires high tissue levels， metronidazole 2 g orally all at once， to be able to obtain sufficiently high tissue levels to be effective. Not uncommonly， a single course is not effective， and a 2-or 3-day course of metronidazole of high dose orally is needed.

【27】38.4 C. The patient takes 2 g of metronidazole as a single dose to attain sufficient tissue levels to eradicate the trichomonads. Metronidazole gel is not as effec-tive. Erythematous vagina and punctuations of the cervix (strawberry cervix) are classic findings of the inflammatory effects induced by trichomoniasis. Classic findings in candidal vaginitis include the curdy or cottage cheese appearance of the vaginal discharge with hyphae or pseudohyphae found on microscopy after discharge is mixed with KOH； this would be treated by flu-conazole. HPV is associated with findings of cervical dysplasia. Ceftriaxone and doxycycline is the treatment for PID. Metronidazole gel would treat BV.

【28】38.5 C. The most common side effects from metronidazole are gastrointestinal including nausea， abdominal discomfort， bloating or diarrhea. A disulfi-ram (Antabuse) effect that can be seen with metronidazole includes facial flushing， headache， hypotension， tachycardia， dizziness， and nausea and vomiting.

【29】CLINICALPEARLS
删除38：<u>)</u>The three most common types of vaginal infections are trichomoniasis， candidal vaginitis， and bacterial vag inosis. Both BV and trichomoniasis is associated with alkaline pH and positive whifftest.

【30】Candidal vulvovaginitis is a common infection in women who are pregnant， taking broad-spectrum antibiotics， diabetic， or immunocompromised.

【31】Bacterial vaginosis is associated with preterm delivery， postpartum endometritis， and pelvic inflammatory disease.

【32】Trichomonal vaginitis is associated with an intense inflammatory process and may induce punctuations ofthe cervix known as"strawberry cervix.”焦瀚远
