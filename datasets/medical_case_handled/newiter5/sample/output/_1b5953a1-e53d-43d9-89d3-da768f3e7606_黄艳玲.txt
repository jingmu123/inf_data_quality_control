Abstract

【10】Ms. Austin is a healthy 21 year-old woman, who appears very anxious in the waiting room. She has a 2-year history of acne vulgaris unresponsive to herbal remedies, topical retinoid agents, and combined topical antibiotic/benzoyl peroxide preparations. She reports that within the past 3 months she has suffered significant discomfort and public embarrassment from the inflamed deep cysts. She is here to get a second opinion about how to improve her acne, stating that her general practitioner has done everything in his power to help her.

【11】Ms. Austin is a healthy 21 year-old woman, who appears very anxious in the waiting room. She has a 2-year history of acne vulgaris unresponsive to herbal remedies, topical retinoid agents, and combined topical antibiotic/benzoyl peroxide preparations. She reports that within the past 3 months she has suffered significant discomfort and public embarrassment from the inflamed deep cysts. She is here to get a second opinion about how to improve her acne, stating that her general practitioner has done everything in his power to help her.

【12】Ms. Austin’s past medical history is unremarkable, and she is currently not taking any medications. Physical exam reveals mixed severe inflammatory and moderate nodulocystic acne. Surprisingly, it appears that she has never been given oral antibiotics or oral retinoids. When you broach the subject of trying an oral antibiotic agent in combination with her topical regimen, her strong rejection of your recommendation takes you aback: “Is this a pill, Doctor? I don’t want to take any pills because they are not good for my body. I have heard many horror stories about people having bad side effects while taking pills. These cysts are terrible, but they don’t kill me – I would rather leave them alone than taking pills to make them disappear.”

【13】Teaching Points
---------------

【14】Ms. Austin reminds us that the same medical information can be perceived very differently from patient to patient. Some patients have no problems taking systemic medications despite clear warnings about significant yet rare adverse effects, while others are reluctant to take anything internally. It is the practitioner’s responsibility to sort out the patient’s fears so that the best approach to controlling her severe cystic acne is ultimately discussed. All of the basic communication and interpersonal skills (e.g. reflective listening, refraining from interrupting the patient, sitting instead of standing while talking to the patient, etc.) are key ingredients in developing a good relationship with a patient who might be fearful of possible adverse effects.

【15】“Ms. Austin, would it be okay if I asked you what questions or concerns you have about this medicine? I promise to do my best to answer them.” A few good things have been demonstrated in these sentences. First, you have shown respect by asking for permission to delve into her fears. Second, you have left an open space for the patient to fill in by phrasing your question as an open-ended request. “What questions or concerns you have” is preferred over asking, “Ms. Austin, do you have any concerns about this medication?” If she is ambivalent about verbalizing her concerns, a close-ended question can easily lead to her answering “no.” Third, the simple phrase “I promise ( or I will try) to do my best to answer them” is designed to make the patient feel reassured and comfortable with discussing issues that might have induced her emotional distress.

【16】Similarly, if the fear is due to uncertainty about whether or not a medication will be therapeutic, then the optimal approach may involve providing reassurance and support. Of note, reassurance can be empty when you have not effectively conveyed that you share Ms. Austin’s perspective. Simple things such as smiling, leaning your body toward the patient when she narrates, demonstrating empathic communication (i.e. naming the emotion she seems to be expressing, understanding, respecting, and supporting her feelings), are all powerful ways to achieve this goal. It may be appropriate to indicate that you have had experiences similar to Ms. Austin’s current situation, without disclosing personal details (i.e. “What I am asking you to do might make you feel nervous. I know this because I have been a patient on a few occasions and got to see things from the other side.”). Showing this patient that you are a vulnerable human being while still maintaining your professionalism (i.e. refraining from over-sharing) might actually help you develop a stronger bond with her.

【17】In addition, it is common for patients to become fearful due to information they have learned that does not apply to their skin diseases. Thanks to the Internet, dermatologic patients can readily access any information available to the public at the click of a mouse. Unfortunately, there has not been any well-established Internet “filter” to help them navigate through this large well of information. Thus, you might have to provide some guidance for your patients in this regard. For instance, Ms. Austin might disclose, “I read on this blog by a young woman close to my age that she took some pill the doctor gave her for acne, and then her face swelled up like a balloon. That really freaked me out, Doctor.” This has been termed “Google terror” by Dr. Neil Prose because the patient’s fear is a result of her learning information that is erroneous, pertaining to extremely rare events, or non-applicable to her case.

【18】In the hypothetical example above, the authors recommend not immediately rebuffing the likelihood of her face swelling up like a balloon, as this might make you appear dismissive to the patient. Please think of it as a legitimate concern. You should compliment Ms. Austin for having done her research on the skin disease: “I applaud you for spending time and effort to learn more about acne. It is often helpful to know that other people have similar experiences as you.” After positively reinforcing her self-efficacy (i.e. the idea that the patient can do a lot to improve her condition), the next moment is a good opportunity to counter her negative impression of the medication, “Ms. Austin, what I am saying is based on my medical knowledge as well as personal experience prescribing these acne pills to many patients. It is very unlikely that your face will swell up like a balloon if you take them the way I ask you to. I understand your concern, but I don’t think that we should worry about it right now.”

【19】According to Dr. Prose, one way to prevent “Google terror” is to anticipate what the patient will possibly find and warn her in advance: “Ms. Austin, you might run across something called acne inversa and descriptions of painful boils in the groin, armpits, or buttocks. This is not what you have, so if I may say this, please ignore it.” This is a strategy to help the patient filter out inappropriate information on the Internet. As a result, she will likely be less anxious before and during subsequent visits, and you can focus your time and energy in those visits to address her legitimate concern黄艳玲
