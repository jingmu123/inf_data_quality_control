【0】Question: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are associated with the development of acute renal failure in patients living in states of effective volume depletion, such as heart failure, cirrhosis, and true volume depletion. What is the mechanism by which NSAIDs are believed to mediate this harmful effect on the kidney?

【1】> (A) Increased prostaglandin synthesis constricts preglomerular vessels

【2】> (B) Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis decreases glomerular capillary permeability

【3】> (C) Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis decreases preglomerular resistance

【4】> (D) Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis increases preglomerular resistance

【5】> (E) The drug has direct toxic effects on the renal tubules

【6】 Answer: The correct answer is D . Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are cyclooxygenase inhibitors. Because cyclooxygenase catalyzes the initial step in the metabolism of arachidonic acid, NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin and thromboxane production. In healthy people, prostaglandins (which are vasodilators) are secreted at a low basal rate and have little effect on renal perfusion. In patients with states of effective volume depletion such as heart failure and cirrhosis, there is increased secretion of the vasoconstrictors angiotensin II and norepinephrine. In these cases, there is increased secretion of prostaglandins (mostly prostacyclin and prostaglandin E2 ) to maintain renal blood flow by counteracting the vasoconstrictive effects of these hormones at preglomerular vessels (eg, the afferent arteriole). When prostaglandin synthesis is inhibited by NSAIDs in these patients, preglomerular resistance increases and renal blood flow (and thus glomerular filtration rate) is reduced. This ischemia can lead to acute renal failure.  
Answer A is incorrect . NSAIDs act to inhibit, not increase, prostaglandin synthesis.  
Answer B is incorrect . Prostaglandins act as vasodilators and do not have an effect on glomerular capillary permeability.  
Answer C is incorrect . Inhibiting the vasodilatory effects of prostaglandins acts to increase preglomerular resistance, causing renal ischemia.  
Answer E is incorrect . Although NSAIDs can also induce acute renal failure by causing an acute interstitial nephritis or minimal change disease, they have not been associated with direct toxic effects on the tubules or acute tubular necrosis.焦瀚远
