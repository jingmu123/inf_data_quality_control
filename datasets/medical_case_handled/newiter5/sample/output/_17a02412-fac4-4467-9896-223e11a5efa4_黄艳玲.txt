【0】CASE 59: KNEE PAIN IN AN ATHLETE

【1】History

【2】A 36-year-old recreational runner presents with anterior knee pain. She has recently  删除换行1 increased training in preparation for a marathon and runs exclusively on roads. A few  删除换行1 weeks prior to presentation she developed crescendo knee pain while running which  删除换行1 did not resolve when she stopped. The pain is now also present at rest. She is otherwise  删除换行1 well with no previous injuries but did experience 8 months of secondary amenorrhoea  删除换行1 due to overtraining in her early twenties. Since then her periods have been normal. She  删除换行1 does not smoke or drink and is on no regular medication although she has been taking  删除换行1 paracetamol for the pain.

【3】Examination

【4】This patient has a normal gait but is unable to hop on the affected side because of the  删除换行1 pain. There is an area of focal bony tenderness in the medial proximal tibia. Examination  删除换行1 of her knee and other joints is normal.

【5】Questions

【6】• What is the likely diagnosis?

【7】• What is the investigation of choice?

【8】• What is the differential diagnosis of anterior knee pain?

【9】• How would you manage this patient?

【10】ANSWER 59

【11】The most likely diagnosis is a stress fracture of the proximal tibia. Stress fractures are  删除换行1 overuse injuries and occur when periosteal resorption exceeds bone formation. They are  删除换行1 commonly seen in two main patient groups: soldiers may suffer so-called march fractures  删除换行1 in the metatarsals, while athletes may develop them in different sites according to their  删除换行1 sporting activity. Although the knee is a common site in runners due to excess mechanical loading, stress fractures may also result in non-weight-bearing sites due to repetitive  删除换行1 and excessive traction (e.g. rib fractures in rowers due to traction from serratus anterior).
The classic symptom – as in this case – is of pain that occurs throughout running and  删除换行1 crucially persists with rest; this is in contrast to shin splints, a traction injury to the  删除换行1 tibial periosteum in which the pain diminishes somewhat with continued activity, only  删除换行1 to return again after the patient has stopped running.

【12】The investigation of choice is CT or MRI as radiographs are frequently normal.

【13】The differential diagnosis of anterior knee pain is extensive and includes:

【14】• patellar maltracking and malalignment

【15】• chondromalacia patellae (a degenerative condition of patellar cartilage)

【16】• patellar tendinopathy

【17】• pre- or infrapatellar bursitis

【18】• meniscal damage

【19】• tight iliotibial band

【20】• referred pain from the hip or lumbosacral spine.

【21】The management of stress fractures is rest until the pain has completely settled and  删除换行1 focal tenderness has resolved. For those with severe stress fractures in the lower limb,  删除换行1 an air-cast boot can offer support and assist in a gradual resumption of weight-bearing.
The crucial feature of rehabilitation is a graded return to sport to prevent progression or  删除换行1 recurrence. Patients with stress fractures should also undergo a thorough physiotherapy  删除换行1 assessment to identify and treat any predisposing biomechanical factors. In addition this  删除换行1 patient already has a history of overtraining and so one should remain alert for the development of the ‘female athlete triad’ of disordered eating, amenorrhoea and osteoporosis.
Many physicians would screen any stress fracture patient with a clinical assessment of  删除换行1 osteoporosis risk followed by a DEXA scan and assessment of serological bone profile  删除换行1 (calcium, alkaline phosphatase and vitamin D status).

【22】KEY POINTS

【23】• Stress fractures are overuse injuries and common in athletes.

【24】• Patients with stress fractures should be assessed for osteoporosis.

【25】• Consider the female athlete triad in any woman with a stress fracture.
