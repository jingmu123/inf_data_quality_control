【0】CASE 70: A LUMPY RASH AND A SWOLLEN KNEE

【1】History

【2】A 24-year-old woman is referred by her general practitioner with a rash over the front of  删除换行1 her shins and an intermittently swollen knee. There is no relevant medical history. She is  删除换行1 a non-smoker who drinks around 8 units of alcohol per week and is taking no medication  删除换行1 except vitamin pills bought over the counter in a health food shop. Her mother has type  删除换行1 2 diabetes. She works as a teacher.

【3】Examination

【4】The lesions over this young woman’s shins are raised and tender. They are of differing  删除换行1 ages and sizes, between 5 and 20 mm, passing through the stages of a bruise as they fade.
There are no other skin lesions. Although she reports knee swelling in the past, there is  删除换行1 no current evidence of inflammatory arthropathy.

【5】Questions

【6】• What is the rash?

【7】• What management would be appropriate?

【8】ANSWER 70

【9】The description of the rash is typical of erythema nodosum. This is most common over  删除换行1 the shins although it may occasionally be seen over the arms or thighs. Common causes  删除换行1 for erythema nodosum include:

【10】• pregnancy

【11】• inflammatory bowel disease

【12】• sarcoidosis

【13】• tuberculosis

【14】• streptococcal infection

【15】• drugs (sulphonamides, penicillin, oral contraceptives among others)

【16】• Behçet’s syndrome

【17】• rheumatic fever

【18】• idiopathic.

【19】The history should be directed towards highlighting or eliminating these most common  删除换行1 underlying conditions by seeking out their associated symptoms. Direct questions in the  删除换行1 systems review might therefore include: pregnancy or contraceptive pill use; fever, sore  删除换行1 throat, cough or breathlessness; diarrhoea or abdominal pain; presence and pattern of  删除换行1 arthropathy. A detailed drug history is also mandatory.

【20】Mild idiopathic erythema nodosum (as in this case) needs no specific treatment. If the  删除换行1 rash is troublesome, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or, if severe, corticosteroids are effective. Any underlying condition is treated independently of the rash.

【21】KEY POINTS

【22】• The rash of erythema nodosum is raised, tender lumps over the shins which discolour  删除换行1 like a bruise.

【23】• It often does not require any specific treatment. Screening questions should be directed  删除换行1 at eliminating an associated underlying condition.
