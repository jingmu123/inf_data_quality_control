He also complains of pain near his first metatarsophalangeal joint in his left foot. Physical examination is remarkable for hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory studies show a preponderance of WBCs (>50,000/mm <sup class=\"calibre40\">3 </sup> ) and a full spectrum of myeloid cells in the peripheral blood smear. On genetic analysis, a translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22 is found.

This patient is suffering from CML caused by the t(9;22) chromosomal translocation, creating the Philadelphia chromosome. This translocation generates a fusion protein, Bcr-Abl , that functions as a constitutively active tyrosine kinase, promoting dysregulated cell growth and division. Imatinib (Gleevec or STI571) is a specific inhibitor of tyrosine kinase. It acts by binding to the ATP-binding pocket of tyrosine kinase, thus inhibiting its ability to phosphorylate.  \n\n【7】Answer A is incorrect . Allopurinol is often used with other chemotherapeutic agents in the initial treatment of CML to prevent attacks of gout due to release of nucleic acids into the plasma from dying WBCs. It does not treat the underlying CML.  \n\n【8】Answer B is incorrect . Busulfan used to be a treatment in patients intolerant of hydroxyurea. Like the others, it has now been supplanted by imatinib.  \n\n【9】Answer C is incorrect . Hydroxyurea is moderately effective in bringing the disease under control and maintaining a normal white count, but its use has been superseded by imatinib.  \n\n【10】Answer E is incorrect .

The pregnancy and perinatal course were uneventful. Generalized hypotonia, tongue fasciculations, and flaccid paralysis are noted on physical examination. His hospital stay is complicated by the development of tracheobronchomalacia and respiratory insufficiency that necessitates mechanical ventilation.

Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is one of the most common autosomal-recessive diseases, affecting approximately one in 10,000 live births. It has a carrier frequency of approximately one in 50 and is characterized by symmetric proximal muscle weakness due to the degeneration of the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord. SMA is classically divided into three subtypes based on age of onset and clinical severity. Type I SMA (Werdnig-Hoffmann disease), the most severe, is characterized by the onset of significant muscle weakness and hypotonia in the first few months of life, and the inability to sit or walk. Manifestations may even occur in utero with reduced fetal movement. Fatal respiratory failure usually occurs before the age of 2 years. Muscle biopsy demonstrates large numbers of atrophic fibers that involve entire fascicles (panfascicular atrophy). Unlike SMA types II and III, this patient’s disease developed at an early age, so early milestones were not achieved. This is not the case in the less severe forms of SMA.  \n\n【6】Answer A is incorrect. BMD involves the same genetic locus that is affected in DMD, but its occurrence is less common. It follows a more indolent course, with onset often occurring in late childhood.  \n\n【7】Answer B is incorrect. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) are both characterized by defects in the 427-kDa protein dystrophin, encoded on the Xp21 region. DMD is the most common form of muscular dystrophy, with an incidence of about one in 3500 live births. Onset typically occurs after infancy and before the age of five. The clinical course is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and wasting that lead to wheelchair dependence by 10-12 years of age. Early motor milestones are met in patients with BMD and DMD.  \n\n【8】Answer C is incorrect. Type III spinal muscular atrophy, or Kugelberg-Welander disease, is characterized by the onset of proximal muscle weakness after the age of 2 years, the ability to walk independently until the disease progresses, and survival into adulthood.  \n\n【9】Answer D is incorrect. Type II spinal muscular atrophy is characterized by the onset of proximal muscle weakness before 18 months of age, the ability to sit but not to walk unaided, and survival beyond 4 years of age.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 13:55:16", "endTime": "2024/09/14 13:55:32", "cost": 16.469}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:04", "update_time": "2024-09-13 21:55:32", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 21:55:15"}

Arthrospores\n\n【2】B. Aseptate hyphae\n\n【3】C. Chlamydospores\n\n【4】D. Germ tubes\n\n【5】E. Tuberculate macroconidia\n\n【6】Answer: 41.1 C. Although multiple Candida species may cause disease in humans, C. albicans is the most frequent species identified. Chlamydospores (Chlamydoconidia) are round, thick-walled spores formed directly from the differentiation of hyphae in which there is a concentration of protoplasm and nutrient material. They may be intercalary (within the hyphae) or terminal (end of hyphae). When grown in serum, germ tubes appear as hyphal-like extensions of yeast cells, usually without a constriction at the point of origin from the cell. Approximately 75% of the yeasts recovered from clinical specimens are C. albicans , and the germ-tube test can usually provide identification within 3 hours. The morphologic features of yeasts on cornmeal agar containing Tween 80 (ICI Americas, Inc.) allow for the differentiation of C. albicans from 5 other Candida species.\n\n【7】Question: 41.2 A 25-year-old man presented with mucosal lesions in his mouth. Based on his CD4 cell count and other signs during the past few months, he was diagnosed as having AIDS. Which of the following is the most likely etiology of the oral lesions?\n\n【8】A. Aspergillus\n\n【9】B. Candida\n\n【10】C. Cryptococcus\n\n【11】D. Mucor\n\n【12】E. Rhizopus\n\n【13】Answer: 41.2 B. The risk factors for cutaneous and mucosal candidiasis include AIDS, pregnancy, diabetes, young or old age, birth control pills, and trauma. Oral thrush can occur on the tongue, lips, gums, or palate. It may be patchy to confluent, and it forms whitish lesions composed of epithelial cells, yeasts, and pseudohyphae. Oral thrush commonly occurs in patients with AIDS. Although the other genera listed may be opportunistic, only Candida routinely presents with mucosal lesions.\n\n【14】Question: 41.3 Which of the following morphologic structures is not associated with C. albicans?\n\n【15】A. Chlamydospore\n\n【16】B. Hyphae\n\n【17】C. Pseudohyphae\n\n【18】D. Sporangium\n\n【19】E. Yeast\n\n【20】Answer: 41.3 D. A sporangium is a sac enclosing spores that is seen in certain fungi but not in Candida species. Spores produced within a sporangium, usually located at the tip of a long hyphal stalk, are released by rupture of the sporangial wall. All other options (chlamydospore, hyphae, pseudohyphae, and yeasts) are routinely observed in C. albicans cultures, depending on conditions of growth.\n\n【21】Question: 41.4 A 35-year-old woman is prescribed tetracycline for a skin infection. She develops vaginal candidiasis. Which of the following is the main reason that individuals taking tetracycline develop candidiasis?\n\n【22】A. C. albicans is capable of degrading the antibiotic.\n\n【23】B. The action of the antibiotic is neutralized by the protein of C. albicans .\n\n【24】C. The antibiotic damages the host mucous membrane.\n\n【25】D. The antibiotic is nutritionally favorable for the growth of C. albicans .\n\n【26】E. The normal bacterial flora is drastically altered by tetracycline.\nAnswer: 41.4 E. Patients with compromised host defenses are susceptible to ubiquitous fungi to which healthy people are exposed but usually resistant. Candida and related yeasts are part of the normal microbial flora but usually are kept at relatively low numbers by the normal faster-growing bacterial flora. If broad-spectrum antimicrobials are used, then much of the usual bacteria flora may be eliminated. No longer held in check, the opportunist yeast may become dominant. Discontinuation of use of broad-spectrum antibiotics is an important first step in patient management, allowing for reestablishment of the normal or usual flora and natural control of the yeast species.\n\n【27】MICROBIOLOGY PEARLS\n\n【28】 Candida albicans is a germ tube–positive yeast that is the most common cause of vaginitis.\n\n【29】 Candida albicans can be distinguished from the other Candida species by formation of a germ tube after incubation in serum.\n\n【30】 The incidence of Candida species other than albicans has increased because of the increased use of azoles and their propensity to develop resistance to those antifungal agents.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:42:49", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:42:54", "cost": 5.337}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:04", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:42:54", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:42:49"}

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) reveals a markedly elevated protein concentration with a normal cell count，commonly referred to as albuminocytologic dissociation. This contrasts the increased cell counts typicalof CNS infection. Increased CSF protein can lead to papilledema.  |\n| What is the appropriate treatment for this condition? The first element of GBS management is supportive care and treatment of the underlying condition witheither IVIG antibody or plasmapheresis.

His central venous pressure (CVP) decreases from 7 to 4 mmHg. In children with altered consciousness, hypotonic polyuria can rapidly lead to hypovolemia and hypernatremia. Rapid and accurate assessment of the patient’s volume status is a crucial component of clinical management. Hypovolemia is associated with adverse outcomes in the child with severe TBI, and therefore initial therapy includes rapid volume expansion with 20 mL/kg of 0.9% normal saline administered over 10 minutes.\n\n【16】1.  What additional therapies would be recommended at this time?\n2.  What determines if the therapy was effective?\n3.  Should any other diagnostic studies be obtained?Rationale and Evidence‐based Practice Explanation\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】### Based on the data given, what are the differential diagnoses and the most likely diagnosis for this child?\n\n【18】Differential diagnoses for this child include syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), cerebral salt wasting (CSW), nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, and central diabetes insipidus.\n\n【19】The most likely diagnosis for this child is central diabetes insipidus. Diabetes insipidus is a disorder resulting in decreased secretion (central/neurogenic) or action (nephrogenic) of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). ADH acts on specific vasopressin receptors and its main physiologic actions are to increase water absorption in the distal nephron and promote the expression of specific water channel proteins on the luminal surface of the collecting duct. Diabetes insipidus manifests with loss of large volumes (>5 mL/kg per hour) of dilute urine (specific gravity <1.010) in the presence of high plasma osmolality (>295 mosmol/kg). Diabetes insipidus is distinguishable with polyuria and polydipsia in uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or other forms of solute diuresis by the absence of glucosuria and a relatively normal rate of total urinary solute excretion.\n\n【20】### Why are children with severe traumatic brain injury at risk for diabetes insipidus?\n\n【21】Neuroendocrine dysfunction can be a consequence of TBI and is a result of both anterior and posterior pituitary insufficiency. TBI can directly and indirectly lead to damage of the ADH‐producing neurons, their axons, or the posterior pituitary resulting in post‐traumatic diabetes insipidus. The pituitary gland and stalk are at particular risk of direct injury in high‐speed acceleration–deceleration shear‐type injuries, because the stalk is surrounded anatomically by the rigid diaphragma sellae and the gland is encased within the rigid bony sella. The rotational velocity of the head may result in stretching or tearing of small vessels or neuronal structures in the hypothalamic–pituitary unit. Indirect injury to the hypothalamic–pituitary unit can result from small vessel damage, inflammatory edema, and hypoxia. The incidence of acute post‐traumatic hypopituitarism of any anterior pituitary hormonal axis is 50–76%. The incidence of posterior pituitary dysfunction (diabetes insipidus) in the acute state following moderate or severe TBI is approximately 20% and permanent diabetes insipidus develops in approximately 7% of patients.\n\n【22】It is often difficult to remember differences between SIADH, CSW and diabetes insipidus 删除25：<u></u>. SIADH occurs for a variety of reasons, including TBI, meningitis, and space‐occupying brain lesions. SIADH occurs as a result of excessive release of ADH from the posterior pituitary gland and causes findings of hyponatremia and decreased urine output. CSW is also related to an intracranial disease process, but the pathophysiology is not as well understood. CSW results in renal loss of sodium with hyponatremia and volume depletion. Diabetes insipidus is a deficiency in ADH, resulting in polyuria with low specific gravity. Diabetes insipidus can be either central or nephrogenic; the nephrogenic form can be either congenital or acquired.\n\n【23】Table 89.2 Characteristics of diabetes insipidus, SIADH and CSW.\n\n|  | Diabetes insipidus | SIADH | CSW |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Serum sodium | High | Low | Low |\n| Serum osmolarity (mosmol/kg) | \\>295 | <280 | <280 |\n| Urine sodium | Low | High | High |\n| Urine osmolarity | Low | High | High |\n| Urine specific gravity | <1.010 | \\>1.020 | \\>1.010 |\n| Urine output | ≥4 mL/hour | ≤1 mL/hour | 2–3 mL/kg per hour |\n\n【25】### What additional therapies would be recommended at this time?\n\n【26】Ongoing fluid replacement should be guided by constant clinical monitoring and CVP measurements to avoid underhydration leading to hypovolemia and potentially decreased cerebral perfusion pressure, as well as overhydration which can exacerbate cerebral edema, increase intracranial pressure, or precipitate pulmonary edema. Additionally, hormonal replacement with desmopressin (exogenous ADH) is indicated. 1‐Deamino‐8‐ D ‐arginine vasopressin (DDAVP), or desmopressin, is a synthetic analog of vasopressin with minimal pressor effects and is the drug of choice for the management of diabetes insipidus. Desmopressin can be administered orally, intranasally, sublingually, or parenterally. In the intensive care setting, the parenteral desmopressin formulation is preferred. There is significant individual variability in the duration and magnitude of effect. The dose of desmopressin should be titrated to normalize urine output and provide the required rate of plasma sodium reduction to avoid risks of overtreatment. Additional doses of desmopressin should be administered for evidence of persistent posterior pituitary dysfunction with derangements in fluid balance, serum osmolality, and serum sodium.\n\n【27】### What determines if the therapy was effective?\n\n【28】Frequent electrolyte laboratory evaluation is indicated as caution must be taken to avoid rapid correction of serum sodium. Cerebral tissue is very sensitive to quick osmotic changes, which can lead to worsening cerebral edema. Clinicians should target a serum sodium correction rate of no more than 0.5 mmol/hour or 10–12 mmol/L over 24 hours. Clinicians should titrate therapy for a urine output of approximately 1 mL/kg per hour and urine specific gravity of 1.010–1.030.\n\n【29】### Should any other diagnostic studies be obtained?\n\n【30】Pituitary dysfunction following TBI can be significant and the incidence of anterior pituitary dysfunction after TBI is around 30% in the acute time frame and remains about 20% at 1 year post injury. Consensus guidelines recommend screening all patients with moderate to severe TBI for pituitary axis dysfunction. Basal hormone testing should be completed on any hospitalized patient with hypotension or hyponatremia and testing at 3 and 12 months regardless of severity of TBI should be performed. Basal testing includes morning cortisol, free T3, free T4, thyroid‐stimulating hormone (TSH), insulin‐like growth factor (IGF)‐1, follicle‐stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone (males), estradiol (females), prolactin, and a 24‐hour urine collection for urinary free cortisol. Patients with polyuria should also have serum sodium and serum osmolality checked.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【1】Christine Schindler通用删除4(英): 1,2 删除换行1:通用删除4(英): 1  Marquette University College of Nursing, Milwaukee, WI, USA\n\n【2】通用删除4(英):2  Medical College of WI/Children’s Hospital of WI, Milwaukee, WI, USA", "content": "【0】89  \nComplication of Traumatic Brain Injury\n===========================================\n\n【1】Christine Schindler通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>1,2</sup></u> 删除换行1:通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>1 </sup></u> Marquette University College of Nursing, Milwaukee, WI, USA\n\n【2】通用删除4(英):<u><sup>2 </sup></u> Medical College of WI/Children's Hospital of WI, Milwaukee, WI, USA\n\n【3】A previously healthy 14‐year‐old boy is admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI).History of Present Illness\n--------------------------\n\n【4】The teen was an unrestrained passenger in a high‐speed motor vehicle collision 3 days ago.

His central venous pressure (CVP) decreases from 7 to 4 mmHg. In children with altered consciousness, hypotonic polyuria can rapidly lead to hypovolemia and hypernatremia. Rapid and accurate assessment of the patient’s volume status is a crucial component of clinical management. Hypovolemia is associated with adverse outcomes in the child with severe TBI, and therefore initial therapy includes rapid volume expansion with 20 mL/kg of 0.9% normal saline administered over 10 minutes.\n\n【16】1.  What additional therapies would be recommended at this time?\n2.  What determines if the therapy was effective?\n3.  Should any other diagnostic studies be obtained?Rationale and Evidence‐based Practice Explanation\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】### Based on the data given, what are the differential diagnoses and the most likely diagnosis for this child?\n\n【18】Differential diagnoses for this child include syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), cerebral salt wasting (CSW), nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, and central diabetes insipidus.\n\n【19】The most likely diagnosis for this child is central diabetes insipidus. Diabetes insipidus is a disorder resulting in decreased secretion (central/neurogenic) or action (nephrogenic) of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). ADH acts on specific vasopressin receptors and its main physiologic actions are to increase water absorption in the distal nephron and promote the expression of specific water channel proteins on the luminal surface of the collecting duct. Diabetes insipidus manifests with loss of large volumes (>5 mL/kg per hour) of dilute urine (specific gravity <1.010) in the presence of high plasma osmolality (>295 mosmol/kg). Diabetes insipidus is distinguishable with polyuria and polydipsia in uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or other forms of solute diuresis by the absence of glucosuria and a relatively normal rate of total urinary solute excretion.\n\n【20】### Why are children with severe traumatic brain injury at risk for diabetes insipidus?\n\n【21】Neuroendocrine dysfunction can be a consequence of TBI and is a result of both anterior and posterior pituitary insufficiency. TBI can directly and indirectly lead to damage of the ADH‐producing neurons, their axons, or the posterior pituitary resulting in post‐traumatic diabetes insipidus. The pituitary gland and stalk are at particular risk of direct injury in high‐speed acceleration–deceleration shear‐type injuries, because the stalk is surrounded anatomically by the rigid diaphragma sellae and the gland is encased within the rigid bony sella. The rotational velocity of the head may result in stretching or tearing of small vessels or neuronal structures in the hypothalamic–pituitary unit. Indirect injury to the hypothalamic–pituitary unit can result from small vessel damage, inflammatory edema, and hypoxia. The incidence of acute post‐traumatic hypopituitarism of any anterior pituitary hormonal axis is 50–76%. The incidence of posterior pituitary dysfunction (diabetes insipidus) in the acute state following moderate or severe TBI is approximately 20% and permanent diabetes insipidus develops in approximately 7% of patients.\n\n【22】It is often difficult to remember differences between SIADH, CSW and diabetes insipidus 删除25：<u></u>. SIADH occurs for a variety of reasons, including TBI, meningitis, and space‐occupying brain lesions. SIADH occurs as a result of excessive release of ADH from the posterior pituitary gland and causes findings of hyponatremia and decreased urine output. CSW is also related to an intracranial disease process, but the pathophysiology is not as well understood. CSW results in renal loss of sodium with hyponatremia and volume depletion. Diabetes insipidus is a deficiency in ADH, resulting in polyuria with low specific gravity. Diabetes insipidus can be either central or nephrogenic; the nephrogenic form can be either congenital or acquired.\n\n【23】Table 89.2 Characteristics of diabetes insipidus, SIADH and CSW.\n\n|  | Diabetes insipidus | SIADH | CSW |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Serum sodium | High | Low | Low |\n| Serum osmolarity (mosmol/kg) | \\>295 | <280 | <280 |\n| Urine sodium | Low | High | High |\n| Urine osmolarity | Low | High | High |\n| Urine specific gravity | <1.010 | \\>1.020 | \\>1.010 |\n| Urine output | ≥4 mL/hour | ≤1 mL/hour | 2–3 mL/kg per hour |\n\n【25】### What additional therapies would be recommended at this time?\n\n【26】Ongoing fluid replacement should be guided by constant clinical monitoring and CVP measurements to avoid underhydration leading to hypovolemia and potentially decreased cerebral perfusion pressure, as well as overhydration which can exacerbate cerebral edema, increase intracranial pressure, or precipitate pulmonary edema. Additionally, hormonal replacement with desmopressin (exogenous ADH) is indicated. 1‐Deamino‐8‐ D ‐arginine vasopressin (DDAVP), or desmopressin, is a synthetic analog of vasopressin with minimal pressor effects and is the drug of choice for the management of diabetes insipidus. Desmopressin can be administered orally, intranasally, sublingually, or parenterally. In the intensive care setting, the parenteral desmopressin formulation is preferred. There is significant individual variability in the duration and magnitude of effect. The dose of desmopressin should be titrated to normalize urine output and provide the required rate of plasma sodium reduction to avoid risks of overtreatment. Additional doses of desmopressin should be administered for evidence of persistent posterior pituitary dysfunction with derangements in fluid balance, serum osmolality, and serum sodium.\n\n【27】### What determines if the therapy was effective?\n\n【28】Frequent electrolyte laboratory evaluation is indicated as caution must be taken to avoid rapid correction of serum sodium. Cerebral tissue is very sensitive to quick osmotic changes, which can lead to worsening cerebral edema. Clinicians should target a serum sodium correction rate of no more than 0.5 mmol/hour or 10–12 mmol/L over 24 hours. Clinicians should titrate therapy for a urine output of approximately 1 mL/kg per hour and urine specific gravity of 1.010–1.030.\n\n【29】### Should any other diagnostic studies be obtained?\n\n【30】Pituitary dysfunction following TBI can be significant and the incidence of anterior pituitary dysfunction after TBI is around 30% in the acute time frame and remains about 20% at 1 year post injury. Consensus guidelines recommend screening all patients with moderate to severe TBI for pituitary axis dysfunction. Basal hormone testing should be completed on any hospitalized patient with hypotension or hyponatremia and testing at 3 and 12 months regardless of severity of TBI should be performed. Basal testing includes morning cortisol, free T3, free T4, thyroid‐stimulating hormone (TSH), insulin‐like growth factor (IGF)‐1, follicle‐stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone (males), estradiol (females), prolactin, and a 24‐hour urine collection for urinary free cortisol. Patients with polyuria should also have serum sodium and serum osmolality checked.", "index": 92, "show": true, "start": 92, "end": 290, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:36:37", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:37:10", "cost": 32.882}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:03", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:37:09", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:36:36"}

His illness began several days ago with low-grade fever, headache, myalgias, and fatigue, and it has slowly worsened. He now has a persistent cough. He has tried multiple over-the-counter cold and cough medications without relief. He has no significant medical or family history. No family members have been ill recently, but one of his good friends missed several days of school approximately 2 weeks ago with “walking pneumonia.” On examination, he is coughing frequently but is not particularly ill appearing. His temperature is 100.5°F (38.1°C), pulse is 90 beats/minute, and respiratory rate is 22 breaths/minute. His pharynx is injected (red and inflamed); otherwise, a head and neck examination is normal. His lung examination is notable only for some scattered rhonchi. The remainder of his examination is normal. Chest radiography shows some patchy infiltration. A sputum Gram stain shows white blood cells but no organisms.\n\n【3】 What is the most likely etiology of this infection?\n\n【4】 What is the explanation for no organisms being seen on Gram stain?\n\n【5】 What rapid, although nonspecific, blood test can provide presumptive evidence of infection by this organism?\n\n【6】### ANSWERS TO CASE 15:\n\n【7】#### Mycoplasma\n\n【8】Summary: A 15-year-old adolescent presents with a persistent cough, patchy infiltrate on chest radiography, and exposure to a friend with “walking pneumonia.”\n\n【9】• Most likely infectious agent: Mycoplasma pneumoniae .\n\n【10】• Reasons no organisms are seen on Gram stain: Mycoplasma pneumoniae does not stain because it does not have a cell wall.\n\n【11】• Rapid blood test for presumptive evidence of M. pneumoniae: Cold agglutinins.\n\n【12】### CLINICAL CORRELATION\n\n【13】M. pneumoniae is transmitted from person to person by aerosolized respiratory droplets and is most common in children and adolescents. Disease caused by M. pneumonia usually has an insidious onset and can progress to tracheobronchitis or pneumonia, which is often patchy or diffuse, as opposed to lobar. Because of the inability to diagnose this on microscopy and the difficulty and length of time required for culture, serologic testing is often used to identify this organism.\n\n【14】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【15】#### Suspected Mycoplasma Pneumoniae Patient\n\n【16】### OBJECTIVES\n\n【17】1\\. Know the structure and physiology of M. pneumoniae and other Mycoplasma organisms.\n\n【18】2\\. Know the clinical diseases associated with and tests for identification of M. pneumoniae .\n\n【19】### DEFINITIONS\n\n【20】TRACHEOBRONCHITIS: Inflammation of the trachea in addition to the bronchi, causing swelling and narrowing of the airways\n\n【21】RHONCHI: A coarse rattling sound heard on auscultation of the lungs of a patient with partially obstructed airways\n\n【22】PRURITUS: Itching; can have many causes: food allergy, drug reaction, kidney/liver disease, aging or dry skin, cancers, infectious agents or other unknown causes\n\n【23】### DISCUSSION\n\n【24】Characteristics of Mycoplasma pneumoniae That Impact Transmission\n\n【25】M. pneumoniae is a short, strictly aerobic rod. It has a trilamellar, sterol-containing cell membrane but no cell wall; therefore, it is not identifiable with Gram or other stains. The lack of a cell wall also confers resistance against β \\-lactams and other antibiotics that act on the cell walls of bacteria. It is the smallest free-living bacterium; even during infection, it remains extracellular. It divides by binary fission and has a doubling time of approximately 6 hours, which is much slower than most bacteria. This contributes to the difficulty in isolating this organism by culture, because up to 6 weeks of incubation is required. Mycoplasma has the adherence protein (Pl) at one end, which is responsible for its attachment to a protein on target cells and may confer its preference for respiratory epithelium. When attached to ciliated respiratory epithelial cells, first the cilia and then the cell is destroyed. This interferes with normal mucociliary clearance and allows the lower airways to be irritated and contaminated with infectious agents.\n\n【26】Mycoplasma pneumoniae is transmitted from person to person by aerosolized respiratory droplets and secretions, and close association with an index case is usually required. No seasonal peak is observed. There is usually a 1- to 3-week incubation period before the onset of clinical disease. Although it can infect those of all ages, disease more commonly occurs in children and young adults. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is responsible for 15% to 20% of instances of community-acquired pneumonia. Clinical presentation consists of a low-grade fever, headache, malaise, and later a nonproductive cough, all with a slow resolution.\n\n【27】### DIAGNOSIS\n\n【28】Diagnosis is primarily made from clinical presentation. Because of the inability to diagnose the infection with microscopy and the difficulty and length of time required for culture, serologic testing is often used to confirm a clinical diagnosis. Antibody-directed enzyme immunoassays and immunofluorescence tests or complement fixation tests are used in diagnosis. Another useful test is to analyze the titer of cold agglutinins. M. pneumoniae infection often results in the stimulation of an IgM antibody against the I-antigen on erythrocytes. This antigen-antibody complex binds at 39.2°F (4°C), causing the clumping of erythrocytes. Although this response can be triggered by other organisms, titers of these antibodies of 1:128 or greater, or a fourfold increase with the presence of an appropriated clinical presentation are considered presumptive evidence of M. pneumoniae disease.\n\n【29】Another Mycoplasma, M. hominis , causes pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), nongonococcal urethritis (NGU), pyelonephritis, and postpartum fever. Another cause of NGU and organism detected with cold agglutinins is Ureaplasma urealyticum , a facultative anaerobic rod. Although this organism can also be a commensal, it can also lead to the sexually transmitted disease NGU and infertility. It is diagnosed via serology, by both cold agglutinins and specific serology with complement fixation and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for IgM. Like Mycoplasma , culture is not reliable and takes many weeks. Polymerase chain reaction probes are also used for diagnosis. The clinical picture of NGU consists of urethral discharge, pruritus, and dysuria. Typically, systemic symptoms are absent. The onset of symptoms in NGU can often be subacute. There are 3 million new cases of NGU (including M. hominis, U. urealyticum, Chlamydia trachomatis , and Trichomonas vaginalis ) each year, and 10% to 40% of women will have PID as a result, compared with only 1% to 2% of men, with morbidity in both men and women from NGU because of stricture or stenosis. NGU occurs equally in men and women, but it can be asymptomatic in 50% of women.\n\n【30】### TREATMENT AND PREVENTION\n\n【31】M. pneumoniae –related pneumonia, as well as other Mycoplasma infections resulting in NGU, can be effectively treated with tetracycline and macrolides. Tetracyclines can be used to treat most mycoplasmas as well as Chlamydia , whereas macrolides can be used to treat Ureaplasma infections, which are resistant to tetracycline. M. pneumoniae infections are difficult to prevent because patients are infectious for extended periods of time, even during treatment. Several attempts have been made to produce inactivated and attenuated live vaccines without success.\n\n【32】###", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 13:51:58", "endTime": "2024/09/14 13:52:31", "cost": 33.396}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:03", "update_time": "2024-09-13 21:52:31", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 21:51:57"}

Evaluation for hormone excess should also be performed prior to fertility treatments when clinically indicated. In our case, the patient had known acromegaly, and multiple IGF-1 levels were assessed after surgical therapy, during medical therapy for acromegaly, and following treatment with radiation therapy. Preconception, after withdrawal of medical therapy, IGF-1 was re-evaluated. Prior to ovulation induction and pregnancy, clinical evaluation for signs and symptoms of acromegaly, blood pressure, and blood glucose levels were assessed. These clinical assessments are recommended also throughout pregnancy. For evaluation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis, free thyroxine and TSH were assessed in tandem to evaluate for central hypothyroidism at baseline presentation, following radiation therapy and in preparation for ovulation induction. Once the patient was placed on thyroid hormone for central hypothyroidism, the free T4 rather than the TSH was monitored to assess adequacy of replacement treatment. Once the diagnosis of central hypothyroidism was established and hormone replacement was initiated, TSH was not used to monitor and guide thyroid hormone replacement therapy since this is not the appropriate metric to determine thyroid dose in central hypothyroidism. In fact, insufficient TSH secretion may result in low TSH levels even when the thyroid dose is inadequate and when thyroxine levels are low. Prior to fertility attempts, a normal free T4, and ideally in the upper normal range, is suggested as the goal of therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\nTable 12.2 删除换行 Diagnosis and management of anterior hypopituitarism in women with pituitary disorders seeking fertility <sup>a</sup>\n\n| Axis  | Screening test for deficiency b  | Stimulation test to confirm deficiency  | Replacement during fertility treatment  | Replacement during pregnancy  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Growth hormone (GH)  | IGF-1  | GH stimulation test  | Controversial c  | Not approved  |\n| Adrenal  | a.m. fasting cortisol  | Cosyntropin stimulation test  | Yes  | Yes Stress dose GC in labor and delivery  |\n| Gonadal  | FSH and estradiol d  | Not indicated  | No  | No  |\n| Thyroid  | TSH and free T4  | Not indicated  | Yes  | Yes Increase dose once pregnancy confirmed  |\n\n【3】Abbreviations: FSH follicle-stimulating hormone, GH growth hormone, IGF-1 insulin-like growth factor 1, TSH thyroid-stimulating hormone, GC glucocorticoids 删除换行1: <sup>a </sup> If identified, hormone excess (GH, prolactin, cortisol) must be managed before fertility treatments 删除换行1: <sup>b </sup> Screening and stimulation testing are recommended before conception 删除换行1: <sup>c </sup> Insufficient data on safety and efficacy of GH replacement during assisted reproduction 删除换行1: <sup>d </sup> Measurement recommended on day 3 of the menstrual cycle\n\n【4】For evaluation of the HPA axis, cosyntropin stimulation testing was used at the time of diagnosis, 6 weeks after surgical therapy, and at intervals post radiation therapy. Monitoring for adrenal insufficiency prior to the start of ovulation induction and conception is appropriate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. Cosyntropin stimulation is not approved for use in pregnant patients, and interpretation of results of the cosyntropin stimulation will vary by trimester 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. Cosyntropin stimulation testing is not a reliable diagnostic test in the setting of acute adrenal insufficiency such as apoplexy, acute hemorrhage postpartum, or acute pituitary trauma, since the adrenal glands will remain responsive to ACTH stimulation after acute endogenous loss of ACTH secretion, and may mount a sufficient peak cortisol in response to this test even in the absence of endogenous ACTH secretion. Typically it will take 1–3 months for the adrenal gland to atrophy, and after that time, the stimulation test will be useful in the confirmation of central adrenal insufficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】For evaluation of the HPG axis, FSH and estradiol levels were obtained once the patient had discontinued birth control pills to assess hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal function. We suggest that birth control pills are withdrawn at least 6 weeks before reliable assessment of the HPG axis. This allows not just for the washout of the hormones which may take just a few days but for the HPG axis to recover which may take a few weeks. Individual variation in the timing to recovery after stopping the oral contraceptive may be seen. In this case, the low FSH and low estrogen levels confirmed hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Mullerian inhibitory factor (MIF) (or anti-Mullerian hormone, AMH) is used to assess ovarian reserve, and lower levels indicate a poor likelihood of response to ovulation induction or in vitro fertilization (IVF).\n\n【6】Testing for central diabetes insipidus (DI) prior to fertility in women with pituitary disorders is important since polyuria and polydipsia during pregnancy are not uncommon in normal pregnancies and untreated DI may be associated with poor outcomes during pregnancy. A normal serum sodium and the absence of polyuria and polydipsia sufficiently exclude the diagnosis in this setting. In a patient with polyuria and polydipsia, a water-deprived serum sodium paired with a urine osmolarity or a water deprivation test can be done. In a patient with appropriate urine concentration after water deprivation, DI is definitively excluded. In such patients, other causes of polyuria and polydipsia should be sought such as hyperglycemia and hypercalcemia.\n\n【7】It is advisable to check levels of hormones such as prolactin, free T4, and cortisol prior to ovulation induction-assisted reproductive therapy since stimulation with gonadotropins and the associated very high estrogen levels will affect these hormones. In general, cosyntropin stimulation test is avoided once conception has occurred.\n\n【8】### Imaging Evaluation\n\n【9】Performing an MRI of the pituitary prior to the onset of ovulation induction is essential to determine the proximity of the superior portion of the tumor to the optic chiasm. Surgery alone or surgery followed by radiation is needed preconception for large tumors with suprasellar extension which are close to or contact the optic chiasm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. To avoid vision problems during pregnancy, it is important to keep in mind that some tumors progress but also that the pituitary gland undergoes lactotroph hyperplasia during pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 21 \\]</u>. Hence, formal visual fields should be obtained at baseline and throughout the pregnancy for macroadenomas. The MRI scans pre- and postoperatively for our patient are shown in Fig. 12.1 . Her visual field test prior to pregnancy was normal.\n\n【10】Management\n----------\n\n【11】### Treatment of Pituitary Hormone Excess\n\n【12】For acromegaly , the patient in the case above had been treated with transsphenoidal surgery and then combination medical therapy with long-acting somatostatin receptor ligand and pegvisomant. She had undergone radiation therapy 2 years before receiving fertility treatment, which was recommended to decrease the risk of tumor growth during pregnancy and to decrease the number of medical therapies required to achieve control prior to fertility treatment. Since the tumor was large and near the chiasm, fractionated radiation therapy with protons was administered. In her case, single-dose radiosurgery was not offered since the large treatment field would expose the optic chiasm to high-dose radiation and the risk of visual loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】Oral contraceptives were stopped in preparation for fertility treatment with ovulation induction. Notably stopping oral contraceptives may be associated with an increase in IGF-1 levels in patients with active acromegaly since oral estrogen levels lower IGF-I, via estrogen’s inhibition of GH signaling 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 \\]</u>. Prior to the initiation of fertility treatment, medical therapy for acromegaly with the combination of GH receptor antagonist and long-acting somatostatin receptor ligand was withdrawn. She was switched to a short-acting somatostatin receptor ligand (subcutaneous octreotide), which was discontinued prior to fertility treatments (anticipated washout of at least 72 h) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 , 25 \\]</u>. Both prolactin and IGF-1 levels were elevated after stopping the combination of GH receptor antagonist and long-acting somatostatin receptor ligand. Therefore, cabergoline was also used prior to and during ovulation induction and discontinued at the time of conception.\n\n【14】Maternal fetal medicine was consulted regarding the maternal fetal risk including gestational diabetes and hypertension. Pituitary imaging during pregnancy was not advised during pregnancy, unless critically necessary and, if so, with a suggestion to perform without contrast. Instead, formal visual fields were suggested each trimester, since it is known that the pituitary gland grows during pregnancy, and this would allow identification of a compressive effect on the chiasm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>. The normal IGF-1 range for pregnancy differs compared to non-gravid state 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 , 26 \\]</u>. Placental hormones and IGF-binding protein changes during pregnancy affect the gestational GH-IGF-1 axis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 26 , 27 \\]</u>. Phosphorylation and proteolysis result in IGF-binding proteins with reduced affinity for IGFs and result in increased bioavailability of IGFs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 28 \\]</u>. Therefore, the patient would be followed clinically rather than with IGF-1 levels during her pregnancy as per Endocrine Society guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 29 \\]</u>. Normalization of prolactin with dopamine agonist prior to pregnancy was achieved, and then the dopamine agonist was stopped at the time of conception. Neither cabergoline nor bromocriptine is approved for use during pregnancy. More data are available on bromocriptine than cabergoline for use during pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 30 \\]</u>, but cabergoline was used preconception in this case since it has demonstrated efficacy in controlling GH excess in acromegaly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 29 , 31 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】### Treatment of Hypopituitarism\n\n【16】#### Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis (HPA)\n\n【17】Women with adrenal insufficiency can be replaced with physiologic GC either with prednisone or hydrocortisone during pregnancy, since both are deactivated by the placental 11-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2, which protects the fetus from excessive cortisol exposure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 32 \\]</u>. Dexamethasone is not the recommended replacement choice in women with adrenal insufficiency during pregnancy since it is not inactivated by placental 11-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 and thus crosses the placenta 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 32 \\]</u>. Optimization of GC dose for the best fertility outcome is an area in which more scientific information is needed. Given that ovulatory function may be compromised by adrenal excess and deficiency, it is reasonable to replace glucocorticoids at the lowest physiologic replacement dose required to avoid symptoms or signs of adrenal insufficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 33 \\]</u> such as weight loss, fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, hypotension, and hyponatremia. For women with hypopituitarism who have been clinically well on a physiologic replacement regimen, dose changes may not be needed when trying to conceive or undergoing fertility therapy. However, the preparation may be switched in anticipation of pregnancy. Hydrocortisone was used in this case since it is the preferred choice during pregnancy, as it does not cross the placenta 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. In patients taking DHEA, these supplements should be stopped before fertility attempts due to dose variability, lack of known safety after conception, and the potential for the androgen interference with ovulation. A meta-analysis suggested that DHEA improved pregnancy rates in women who had previously had poor IVF outcome for any reason 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 34 \\]</u>, but neither safety nor use in hypopituitarism has been prospectively evaluated.\n\n【18】The increased stress of surgery under anesthesia demands stress dose GC replacement for patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 35 \\]</u>, and, therefore, in women with central hypopituitarism undergoing egg retrieval, stress dose steroids will be needed. GC dose increases should not generally be required during fertility treatment and during embryo transfer or hysteroscopy, unless anesthesia is required.\n\n【19】For women with demonstrated GH deficiency, if GH replacement is started during fertility treatment to improve the follicular response to gonadotropins, a controversial intervention but one utilized in some centers, it is prudent to consider that the addition of GH may prompt a need for the increase in GC dose since GH suppresses the conversion of cortisone to cortisol via its inhibitory effect on the enzyme 11-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 33 , 36 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】#### Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Thyroid Axis\n\n【21】In the patient case described above, central hypothyroidism was treated with thyroid hormone to keep the patient clinically and biochemically euthyroid. In preparation for pregnancy and, to optimize fertility, the thyroid hormone dose was adjusted to keep free T4 in the upper normal range. TSH is not useful in this setting. Reducing thyroid hormone replacement based on a low TSH alone is inappropriate and may result in hypothyroidism with a negative impact on reproductive function. Thyroid testing must be interpreted differently amidst a stimulated cycle in which very high estrogen levels will increase TBG, similar to pregnancy when the total T4 will be higher due to increased TBG. TSH will be lower in the first trimester due to the thyrotropic effect of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 37 \\]</u>. Some free T4 assays may be unreliable during pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 38 \\]</u>. Free T4 by equilibrium dialysis, and other techniques such as liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) may have more reliability in pregnancy than automated immunoassays for free T4 but also may have less availability, be more expensive, and take longer for results when monitoring during pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 39 \\]</u>.

Given the clinical findings and results of the investigations, which cause is most  删除换行1: likely and why?\n\n【18】3. What further tests are required to confirm and establish this diagnosis?\n\n【19】ANSWER 22\n\n【20】According to the latest NICE guidelines, hypertension is defined as blood pressure of  删除换行1: 140/90 mmHg or higher that is confirmed by home or ambulatory blood pressure moni删除8：<u>￾</u>toring. In the majority of patients, there is no clear cause (“essential hypertension”) but a  删除换行1: secondary cause is present in around 5–10% of cases. Secondary hypertension should be  删除换行1: considered in young patients, those with very high blood pressure (>180/110 mmHg), absence  删除换行1: of risk factors for essential hypertension, a history of hypertensive emergencies, and severe  删除换行1: or progressive target organ damage (e.g. deteriorating renal function), and where there are  删除换行1: particular symptoms or signs suggestive of an underlying cause (e.g. palpitations, flushing). \n\n【21】Here, the fact that our patient was first diagnosed with hypertension in her thirties and that  删除换行1: it is still poorly controlled is an indication that a secondary cause should be considered.\n\n【22】The causes of secondary hypertension may be categorized as follows:\n\n【23】• Renal, including renal parenchymal disease, renal artery stenosis and renin删除8：<u>￾</u>producing tumours\n\n【24】• Endocrine, including primary aldosteronism, Cushing’s syndrome, phaeochromo删除8：<u>￾</u>cytoma, acromegaly, and hypo- or hyperthyroidism\n\n【25】• Cardiac (coarctation of the aorta)\n\n【26】• Neurologic, particularly raised intracranial pressure and stress\n\n【27】• Other, including obstructive sleep apnoea and drugs (e.g. steroids, NSAIDs)\n\n【28】In this patient, the normal abdominal and cardiac examination would seem to rule out a reno删除8：<u>￾</u>vascular or cardiac cause, while normal renal function excludes the presence of renal parenchy删除8：<u>￾</u>mal disease. A normal thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) precludes thyroid dysfunction, and  删除换行1: there are no clinical features to suggest Cushing’s syndrome or phaeochromocytoma. Though  删除换行1: stress could be a potential cause, the finding of mild hypokalemia makes primary aldosteron删除8：<u>￾</u>ism the likeliest diagnosis.\n\n【29】Primary aldosteronism refers to increased production of aldosterone by the adrenal cortex,  删除换行1: most commonly caused by an adenoma (Conn’s syndrome) and sometimes by bilateral adrenal  删除换行1: hyperplasia. This leads to excess retention of sodium, and subsequently water, consequently  删除换行1: expanding extracellular fluid volume, and thereby leading to higher blood pressure. Aldosterone  删除换行1: is responsible for stimulating potassium excretion, hence the finding of hypokalemia.\n\n【30】There are three steps in working up a suspected case of primary aldosteronism: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> screening,  删除换行1: 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> diagnosis, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> elucidating the cause. Screening is performed by measuring the  删除换行1: aldosterone:renin ratio, which would be very high (>2000) in hyperaldosteronism as a result  删除换行1: of feedback suppression of renin secretion. Subsequently, a confirmatory diagnostic test is  删除换行1: needed, such as a fludrocortisone suppression test or a saline infusion test. The principle  删除换行1: is that fludrocortisone should suppress aldosterone levels in normal individuals, while in  删除换行1: the saline infusion test, sodium loading should inhibit aldosterone secretion. Once primary  删除换行1: aldosteronism is confirmed, imaging of the adrenal glands (via CT, or, occasionally, MRI) is  删除换行1: needed to identify an adenoma or to exclude a functional adrenocortical carcinoma.\n\n【31】KEY POINTS\n\n【32】• The majority of cases of hypertension are idiopathic, but around 5–10% are due to  删除换行1: a secondary cause.\n\n【33】• Clues suggesting a secondary cause include young age of onset, very high blood pres删除8：<u>￾</u>sures, hypertensive emergencies and specific symptoms (e.g. flushing, palpitations).\n\n【34】• Primary aldosteronism is one cause of secondary hypertension and may be  删除换行1: screened for by measuring the aldosterone:renin ratio.Case 23: Nausea, vomiting, weakness and paraesthesia", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 13:52:33", "endTime": "2024/09/14 13:53:02", "cost": 28.925}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:03", "update_time": "2024-09-13 21:53:02", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 21:52:33"}

The bird was treated orally with 0.05 mL of 50% dextrose solution for her hypoglycemia. At the same time, 6 mL of lactated Ringer's solution was given subcutaneously. She received more subcutaneous fluids and was fed by gavage a nestling bird diet 4 hours later when she became more stable. A radiographic examination was postponed until she became stronger. An intraosseous catheter was placed in the left ulna for fluid delivery at this time because her overall condition had improved. She spent the night in the critical care unit for monitoring and fluid support. The next morning, she appeared quiet, but was alert and responsive. She also appeared stronger with reduced dyspnea. At this time, her PCV was 44%, supporting the diagnosis of a relative erythrocytosis on presentation. Since her overall condition had improved, radiographs were obtained. The radiographs revealed a slightly larger than pea–sized opacity within the caudal lungs, suggesting the possible presence of a granuloma (fungal or bacterial) or neoplasia. Additional diagnostic testing that included a tracheal ash for cytology and culture, laparoscopy with possible biopsy for histology and culture, or an MRI was offered. Later that day, the bird was taken off the oxygen support for 20 minutes to evaluate her ability to breathe and recover without oxygen supplementation. Although she maintained a slightly increased respiratory rate, the lack of oxygen did not exacerbate the respiratory effort. The client elected to take the bird home for monitoring and nursing care to return the next day for further diagnosis. The client did not return for the scheduled appointment because the bird was behaving normally at home.

PGLs can be found from the skull base and inner ear to the scrotum. Most skull base and neck PGLs have a parasympa-thetic origin and are biochemically nonfunctioning. However， 3%-5% of skull base and neck PGLs are of sympathetic origin and can hypersecrete dopa-mine and/or norepinephrine.

She had noticed “a knot in my right neck”for about 10 years. It had been attributed by physicians to “swollen glands”over the years. Recently she developed symptoms of episodic heart racing. In addition， although usually normo-tensive， she had episodic elevated blood pressure(e.g.， 188/110 mmHg). To investigate the neck mass。 mmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI)Was performed elsewhere and detected a large right glomus vagale PGL. On physical examination her body mass index was 26.8 kg/m\\， bloodpressure was 140/86 mmHg， and heart rate was 77 beats per minute. Palpation of the neck revealed a mass high in the neck that extended under the angle of the mandible.\n\n【5】INVESTIGATIONS\n\n【6】The plasma fractionated metanephrines and 24-hour urine for fractionated metanephrines and catecholamines were normal . Skull base and neck PGLs should always be screened for dopamine hypersecre-tion.1-3 A clinical pearl not well known to most endo-crinologists is that because of the high sulfation rate of dopamine at the kidney 24-hour urine for measurement of dopamine may be unreliable. Thus either plasma dopamine or methoxytyramine should be measured. Plasma catecholamines were obtained from in indwell-ing cannula after the patient was in the supine position and rested condition for 30 minutes. Despite the nor-mal 24-hour urinary excretion of dopamine， the plasma dopamine concentration was more than 19-fold above the upper limit of the reference range 删除25：<u></u>.\n\n| TABLE 44.1  | Laboratory Tests  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  | Reference  |\n| Biochemical Test  |  | Result  | Range  |\n| Sodium， mmol/L  |  | 139  | 135-145  |\n| Potassium， mmol/L  |  | 4.2  | 3.6-5.2  |\n| Creatinine，mg/dL  |  | 0.9  | 0.6-1.1  |\n| Plasma metanephrine， nmol/L  |  | 1.1  | <0.5  |\n| Plasma normetanephrine， nmol/L  |  | 14.0  | <0.9  |\n| Plasma norepinephrine， pg/mL  |  | 388  | <750  |\n| Plasma epinephrine， pg/mL  |  | <25  | <111  |\n| Plasma dopamine，pg/mL  |  | 575  | <30  |\n| 24-Hour urine：  |  |  |  |\n| Metanephrine， mcg  |  | 129  | <400  |\n| Normetanephrine， mcg  |  | 263  | <900  |\n| Norepinephrine，mcg  |  | 35  | <80  |\n| Epinephrine， mcg  |  | 5.7  | <20  |\n| Dopamine， mcg  |  | 333  | <400  |\n\n【8】All patients with PGLs should be offered germline genetic testing for pathogenic variants in the succi-nate dehydrogenase subunits (SDHx).4 She proved to hotehave a pathogenic variant in SDH subunit B (SDHB； p.V140F).\n\n【9】Skull base and neck MRI showed a 2.8×5.3×2.9-cm right glomus vagale PGL . As the result of her SDHB mutation， risk for more than one PGL， and potential for metastases from her known neck PGL， 123-I metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy and MRI of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained. No additional PGLs or sites of metastatic disease were found.\n\n【10】TREATMENT\n\n【11】Treatment with phenoxybenzamine was started at10 mg per day and titrated for a low-normal systolic blood pressure. Three days later， metoprolol extended release was added for a target heart rate of 80 beats per minute. Preoperative tumor embolization was planned. In addition to a- and p-adrenergic block-ade， a-methyl-paratyrosine (metyrosine) was added to her treatment program 4 days before the ablation. Metyrosine blocks tyrosine hydroxylase and inhibits the synthesis of catecholamines and was added in an effort to attenuate a potential massive release of dopa-mine with the embolization.3.5，6 Selective catheteriza-tion of branches off the right ascending pharyngeal artery and two branches of the right occipital artery was performed with microcatheter technicue. and th mic tumor embolization was completed with polyvinyl alcohol foam particles (250-350 um).

The concept of life-long surveillance to look for PGL recur-rence of metastatic disease was reinforced. She was informed that metastatic disease can appear as much as 50 years after surgery. She was also counseled on the need for long-term surveillance for new PGLs associated with her SDHB pathogenic variant.

The suspensory ligaments (also known as the infundibulopelvic ligaments) contain the ovarian arteries and veins, which are responsible for the direct blood supply to the ovaries. The ovaries also receive collateral flow from the uterine arteries that travel in the cardinal (transverse cervical) ligament at the base of the broad ligament.  \n\n【7】Answer A is incorrect. The cardinal (transverse cervical) ligament carries descending branches of the uterine artery. Although the uterine arteries provide collateral blood flow to the ovaries, severing the cardinal ligament should not significantly decrease blood flow to the ovary if the ovarian arteries remain intact.  \n\n【8】Answer B is incorrect. The fallopian tubes carry the ova from the ovary to the uterus during ovulation. Severing this structure would disrupt normal fertilization but would not significantly affect blood flow to the ovary.  \n\n【9】Answer C is incorrect. The round ligament runs inferior to the ovary before attaching to the uterus. It contains no important structures and is not a source of blood for the ovary.  \n\n【10】Answer E is incorrect.

It represents early repolarization of  删除换行1: a portion of the ventricle, before the entire myocardium has been depolarized. \n\n【16】There is an early uptake of the S-T segment, before the descending limb of the \n\n【17】R wave has reached the baseline. This causes an initial slur on the S-T segment,  删除换行1: known as the J wave. The S-T segment is elevated and concave upwards. There is  删除换行1: an associated increased amplitude of the R wave. The T wave is also tall, but the  删除换行1: ratio of S-T segment elevation to T wave height is less than 0.25. Interestingly,  删除换行1: the degree of S-T elevation and T wave height may vary on a day-to-day basis  删除换行1: and the S-T segment may normalize after exercise. Besides the features already  删除换行1: mentioned, other characteristics of this syndrome are sinus bradycardia with  删除换行1: sinus arrhythmia, voltage criteria of left ventricular hypertrophy and persistent  删除换行1: juvenile pattern of T wave inversion in leads V1 删除换行1:  to V3 删除换行1: .\n\n【18】ECG INTERPRETATION \n\n【19】The ECG showed tall R waves in the lateral precordial leads, preceded by narrow \n\n【20】Q waves. The S-T segment was elevated concave upwards, with an initial slur on  删除换行1: the S-T segment (J wave). The T waves were upright, tall and symmetrical in the  删除换行1: lateral leads, with prominent U waves in the mid-precordial leads. These findings  删除换行1: are consistent with the diagnosis of early repolarization syndrome . \n\n【21】Since early repolarization is frequently observed in healthy athletic persons, this  删除换行1: entity is also known as the “athlete’s heart”. \n\n【22】There are several causes of S-T segment elevation , of which acute  删除换行1: myocardial infarction is the leading cause. The S-T segment elevation of early  删除换行1: repolarization, can simulate the injury pattern of acute myocardial infarction. \n\n【23】However, there are several classical differentiating features: \n\n【24】•\t S-T segment elevation is concave upwards in lead V6\n\n【25】•\t Ratio of S-T elevation : T wave height is below 0.25\n\n【26】•\t There is no reciprocal S-T depression in other leads\n\n【27】•\t ECG changes do not evolve as in case of infarction\n\n【28】•\t ECHO does not show abnormal regional wall motion \n\n【29】•\t Serial level of cardiac enzyme titers are not increased.Case 40 Early Repolarization Syndrome 185\n\n【30】Table 40.2: Causes of S-T segment elevation \n\n【31】Coronary artery disease\n\n【32】•  Myocardial infarction\n\n【33】•  Prinzmetal’s angina\n\n【34】•  Dressler’s syndrome\n\n【35】•  Ventricular aneurysm\n\n【36】Non-coronary disease \n\n【37】•  Acute pericarditis\n\n【38】•  Pulmonary embolism\n\n【39】•  Early repolarization\n\n【40】•  Brugada syndrome\n\n【41】Early repolarization is more frequently observed among young athletic males  删除换行1: of Africo-Carribean descent. They are healthy subjects who are free of symptoms  删除换行1: and their clinical examination is entirely normal. Acute viral pericarditis also  删除换行1: presents with concave-upwards S-T segment elevation but sinus tachycardia  删除换行1: is almost invariably present. Moreover, patients of acute pericarditis have a  删除换行1: preceding flu-like illness, they present with chest pain and there is an audible  删除换行1: pericardial rub. \n\n【42】MANAGEMENT ISSUES \n\n【43】Individuals who have features of early reploarization on the ECG, are healthy  删除换行1: asymptomatic subjects without any objective evidence of organic heart disease. \n\n【44】Therefore, no specific treatment apart from reassurance is advocated.

Based on the additional information, what differential diagnoses will you continue to consider?\n2.  What pharmacologic interventions may be necessary for this patient?\n3.  Would you resume the blood transfusion?Rationale and Evidence‐based Practice Explanation\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】### Based on the data given, what are the differential diagnoses and the most likely diagnosis for the acute change in this child?\n\n【19】The onset of the child’s symptoms suggest that he is experiencing a reaction to the blood transfusion. Blood transfusion reactions are divided into immediate immunologic complications and non‐immunologic complications. Immediate immunologic complications include hemolytic transfusion reaction, febrile non‐hemolytic reaction, allergic reaction, anaphylactoid/anaphylactic reaction, and transfusion‐related acute lung injury. Non‐immunologic complications include transmission of infection including cytomegalovirus and bacterial sepsis, transfusion‐associated circulatory overload, hypothermia, and other metabolic derangements. The most common type of transfusion reaction during red blood cell or platelet transfusion is an allergic reaction. There are additional, less-common potential transfusion reactions that should be considered when caring for a patient receiving a blood product. In order of prevalence they are: febrile non‐hemolytic reaction, circulatory volume overload, acute hemolysis, hypotensive reaction, bacterial contamination, sepsis, acute lung injury, and air embolism.\n\n【20】### What is your immediate response for this patient? Describe your assessment of each body system\n\n【21】It is essential to verify that the blood transfusion has been stopped and 0.9% saline is infusing intravenously. The patient should immediately be assessed for evidence of airway, breathing, or circulatory compromise. As you evaluate the patient, it is important to obtain any history of previous allergic reactions or exposures, any complaints of pain, unusual sensation in the throat, change in voice, or gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea and stomach ache. Vital signs should be obtained.\n\n【22】Your evaluation by system should include the following.\n\n【23】   General: mental status, ability to respond to questions, anxiety, perception of impending doom.\n   Head, eyes, ear, nose and throat: facial color, nasal congestion, patency of the throat, mucosal edema.\n   Cardiovascular: chest pain, central and peripheral perfusion.\n   Lungs: breath sounds, work of breathing.\n   Integument: presence of urticarial or other rash, skin color.\n\n【24】It is necessary to verify the label on the blood transfusion bag and also notify the blood bank of a suspected transfusion reaction. Additional laboratory studies may be required as directed by the blood bank.\n\n【25】### Based on the additional information, what differential diagnoses will you continue to consider?\n\n【26】The child is not having respiratory symptoms, such as tachypnea, hypoxemia, bronchospasm, or dyspnea, so acute lung injury and circulatory volume overload are less likely at this time. The most common signs/symptoms of a transfusion reaction are fever, chills, pruritis, and urticaria. Any increase in temperature with chills, rigors, hypotension, nausea or vomiting should lead you to consider a hemolytic reaction or reaction due to bacterial contamination. Since he has not had an increase in temperature of 1°C or more and did not have a temperature above 38.0°C, febrile transfusion reaction and possible sepsis could be excluded from the differential diagnosis. However, new signs could still arise and transfusion reactions can develop up to 24 hours following the transfusion. One should always be aware of the potential for a more severe reaction to develop and for the signs which indicate a severe transfusion reaction. Other findings of more severe transfusion reactions include chills, rigors, nausea, vomiting, hypotension, respiratory distress, hemoglobinuria, loss of consciousness, back pain, jaundice, abnormal bleeding, and oliguria. This child was experiencing an allergic blood transfusion that was limited to urticaria, though he required ongoing evaluation for more extensive signs and symptoms. The CBC obtained during the transfusion demonstrated a slight rise in the hemoglobin and hematocrit, appropriate for the volume of red cells that had been administered at the time the sample was drawn.\n\n【27】### What pharmacologic interventions may be necessary for this patient?\n\n【28】An H <sub>1 </sub> antihistamine is recommended to treat the symptom of hives and itching. The pediatric dosing recommendation is 1–2 mg/kg. If the reaction progressed and was consistent with anaphylaxis, additional intervention would be required according to Pediatric Advanced Life Support. Signs of anaphylaxis include bronchospasm, respiratory distress, hypotension, and gastrointestinal upset. The first‐line intervention for anaphylaxis is intramuscular epinephrine (1:1000) at a dose of 0.01 mg/kg, with a maximum dose 0.3 mg. In addition to the H <sub>1 </sub> antihistamine, an H <sub>2 </sub> antihistamine such as ranitidine may also be prescribed for cutaneous manifestations. Corticosteroids may also be indicated. A normal saline bolus of 20 mL/kg may be administered for hemodynamic instability. In the setting of wheezing, albuterol, a β <sub>2 </sub> ‐adrenergic receptor agonist bronchodilator, may also be administered via inhaler or nebulizer.\n\n【29】### Would you resume the blood transfusion?\n\n【30】If the patient’s only symptom of blood product transfusion reaction was urticaria that resolved after diphenhydramine administration, the transfusion with the same unit can be restarted at a slower rate with close observation. If additional signs of allergic reaction or new signs of fever or other type of reaction occur, the unit should be returned to the blood bank accompanied by appropriate transfusion reaction laboratory sampling.Case Resolution\n---------------\n\n【31】This child tolerated resumption of the packed cell transfusion at a slower rate. The urticarial rash resolved and the follow‐up CBC demonstrated an appropriate rise in hemoglobin and hematocrit.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:45:58", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:46:15", "cost": 17.286}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:03", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:46:15", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:45:58"}

Slit-lamp examinations\n\n【18】D. Amylase and lipase tests\n\n【19】44.1 C. Reactivation TB (in this case， likely triggered by infliximab) usually involves the apical aspects of the lungs. Primary pulmonary TB infection most often affects the middle and lower lobes (answer A). Lymphadenitis (answer D) and pleural disease (answer B) are the most common extrapulmonary TB infections， but they are less common than pulmonary TB.\n\n【20】44.2 B. Pyridoxine (vitamin B ) is important for preventing the peripheral neurop-athy that can complicate INH therapy. Assuming that his neurologic exami-nation is normal other than some minimal decreased sensation， initiation of pyridoxine and careful monitoring is the best course of action. If the physical examination shows weakness， abnormal deep tendon reflexes， or dermatomal distribution， then imaging of the lumbar spine such as CT scan (answer A) 删除换行1: would be indicated. If the numbness were caused by Pott disease， he would be expected to have back pain and other neurologic findings， such as lower extremity weakness. Continuing therapy without pyridoxime is inappropri-ate (answer C)， and vitamin B should have been started at the onset of his therapy. Workup for femoral nerve impingement (answer D) is not indicated unless the physical examination points to a pure femoral nerve palsy.\n\n【21】44.3 A. Because this woman is a household contact of a patient with active TB， she is in the highest risk group. Her skin test would be considered positive with 5-mm induration. Therefore， observation (answer C) would be inap-propriate， and inducing three sputum samples (answer D) would not be required. She has latent TB infection and should be offered treatment to pre-vent reactivation TB later in life. INH is the treatment of choice for exposure prophylaxis. Rifampin offers a safe alternative for a shorter duration. Triple therapy (answer B) is indicated for an active TB infection， but not for a con-tact asymptomatic situation.\n\n【22】44.4 B. Drug-induced liver injury is a complication of treatment with INH， pyra-zinamide， and rifampin； therefore， liver enzyme levels are the most impor-tant parameters to monitor. Baseline liver tests are obtained in all patients， and monthly monitoring of hepatic enzymes is recommended for patients at increased risk of liver toxicity. Alcohol use， prior liver disease， pregnancy， and the first 3 months postpartum are risk factors for liver injury. Renal (answer A) and pancreatic (answer D) functions are not as much of a concern with drugs used to treat TB. Slit-lamp examinations assess the anterior chamber of the eye (answer C) and are indicated for medications such as amiodarone， which can cause corneal deposits； the TB drug that can lead to blindness is eth-ambutol， but this would be an optic neuritis and not detected on slit-lamp examination.\n\n【23】CLINICAL PEARLS\n\n【24】Reactivation pulmonary TB most commonly presents radiographically with opacities in the apical and posterior segments of the upper lobes.\n\n【25】Tuberculin skin testing is not a diagnostic test but is a useful screen-ing test for potential contacts of infected persons； the response cutoff for a positive test depends on the patient's level of risk. IGRAs such as QuantiFERON@-TB Gold are also useful to diagnose latent TB.\n\n【26】Patients with a positive tuberculin skin test and no clinical or radiographic evidence of active disease are said to have latent TB infection； they can be treated with INH or rifampin to reduce their lifetime risk of developing reactivation TB.\n\n【27】Individuals with active TB should be initiated on multidrug therapy，such as INH， rifampin， pyrazinamide， and ethambutol.\n\n【28】Pyridoxine (vitamin B.) is usually added to antituberculosis medications to prevent peripheral neuropathy.\n删除20：<u>Blumberg HM， Burman WJ， Chaisson RE， et al.

The mother also notes that the patient has become more irritable and has not been feeding well. Although her mother received limited prenatal care, the child was born at 38 weeks’ gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery without complications. The patient undergoes lumbar puncture, and a Gram stain of cerebrospinal fluid is shown in the image.

This patient’s presentation is highly suspicious for bacterial meningitis. In the neonate, clinical symptoms are nonspecific (fever, irritability, lethargy, poor feeding) when compared with those in older children or adults (nuchal rigidity). The most common cause of neonatal meningitis is group B Streptococcus , specifically Streptococcus agalactiae , a β-hemolytic, gram-positive coccus found in chains. In contrast with its group A counterparts, S agalactiae is bacitracin resistant. Infection with this organism occurs during vaginal delivery, as 40% of women are asymptomatic carriers of this bacterium in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and vagina. Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes are the second and third most common causes of meningitis in infants <3 months old.  \n\n【8】Answer A is incorrect . Escherichia coli is a gram-negative, lactose-fermenting bacillus. It is the second leading cause of neonatal meningitis.  \n\n【9】Answer B is incorrect . Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) is a small gramnegative encapsulated coccobacillus that was once a major cause of serious bacterial infections, including meningitis, sepsis, and epiglottitis. It requires factors V and X to successfully culture on chocolate agar. However, the incidence of H influenzae meningitis has decreased significantly in the last 10-15 years as a result of the widespread administration of the Hib vaccine. Nevertheless, Hib still causes 5% of cases of meningitis in children ages 6 months to 6 years.  \n\n【10】Answer C is incorrect . Listeria monocytogenes is the third most common cause of neonatal meningitis (2%). It is a grampositive bacillus.  \n\n【11】Answer D is incorrect . Streptococcus pneu-moniae is a gram-positive coccus that is found in chains, but it is not a significant cause of meningitis in neonates.

Primary cardiac neoplasm (PCN) was rare. Autopsy confirmed its morbidity between 0.17% and 0.28% (Zhong-min et al. Practical clinic cardiac surgery \\[M\\] 623–631, 2010). With echo, CT, and MR application, more and more asymptomatic patients are found by chance. PCN was divided into benign and malignant, at a ratio of 3:1. According to the morbidity, benign tumor was cardiac myxoma, cardiac fibroma, cardiac rhabdomyoma, and so on. About 66.7% of benign cardiac tumor is myxoma, which mostly come from atrial septum. Cardiac fibroma was the second common cardiac benign tumor (Toyama et al. Rep Case Kyobu Geka 70通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u>:317–319, 2017). Although it was called benign tumor, it is with the character of malignancy. Surgery usually cannot remove the tumor completely and they recur after operation. Furthermore, it also results in sudden death in children (Aw et al. Pediatr Cardiol 8通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u>:394–400, 2017). Cardiac rhabdomyoma is a rare PCN with skeletal muscle differentiation, which is the most common PCN in children, especially in newborns and infants. It may be partially or completely dissipated; so conservative treatment is generally recommended (Dinesh Kumar et al. Ann Card Anaesth. 19通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u>:728–732, 2016). Only when cardiac rhabdomyomas cause hemodynamic obstruction or heart rhythm disorders that affect cardiac function, medical treatment or surgical resection is necessary. The main purpose of surgery is to relieve hemodynamic blockage, protect ventricular and valve function, and prevent conduction damage. We are reporting a case of left ventricular mass presenting with KD.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:46:21", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:48:45", "cost": 144.051}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:03", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:48:43", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:46:19"}

Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a vasculitis (ie, inflammation of a blood vessel) characterized by inflammation affecting small to medium-sized arteries, particularly the renal, cardiac, and GI-tract vessels (usually not the pulmonary vasculature). As many as 30% of patients have had prior hepatitis-B infections.  \n\n【7】Answer A is incorrect . Buerger disease, also known as thromboangiitis obliterans, is a vasculitis that mostly affects arteries and veins of the extremities. As such, patients often have intermittent claudication and Raynaud phenomenon. The majority of patients are men who are heavy smokers and show hypersensitivity to tobacco injected into the skin.  \n\n【8】Answer B is incorrect . Giant cell (temporal) arteritis is a type of vasculitis that affects the arteries of the head, especially, of course, the temporal arteries. The highlights of this disease can be remembered by the mnemonic, JOE: patients get J aw pain and O cular disturbances from ischemia to the arteries supplying them. Patients also often have markedly elevated E rythrocyte sedimentation rates. The disease is often associated with the presence of polymyalgia rheumatica.  \n\n【9】Answer C is incorrect . Kawasaki disease is a self-limited vasculitis that normally occurs in infants and children and is characterized by conjunctival and oral erythema, fever, erythema and edema of the palms and soles, generalized rash, and cervical lymph node swelling. About 20% of patients may go on to develop coronary artery inflammation and/or aneurysm.  \n\n【10】Answer E is incorrect . Takayasu arteritis is a vasculitis characterized by fibrotic thickening of the aortic arch (it also affects the pulmonary arteries, the branches of the aortic arch, and the rest of the aorta in up to one-third of patients).

Smoking is almost always the cause. Unlike these diseases， the airway obstruction seen in asthma is usually reversible.  |\n| What is the pathophysiology of this condition? Acutely， bronchial hyperresponsiveness leads to episodic， reversible bronchoconstriction. Specifically，smooth muscle contraction in the airways leads to expiratory airflow obstruction.

She has been seen several times by different GP partners over the previous couple of  删除换行1: years with abdominal pain. She describes the pain as peri-umbilical, non-radiating, some删除8：<u>￾</u>times sharp, but usually an ache. There is no obvious periodicity, including to food. Her  删除换行1: appetite is good, and there are no concerns about her growth and weight gain. She opens  删除换行1: her bowels most of the days and there has never been any blood or mucus. She occasionally  删除换行1: feels nauseated with the pain, but has never vomited.

She lives with her mother, but she and her 4-year-old brother have frequent contact  删除换行1: with their father. She was doing well at infant school but is now falling behind, having missed  删除换行1: quite a lot of school. She has won several badges for gymnastics. There is no family history  删除换行1: of note, including migraine.

Her nails are bitten,  删除换行1: but there is no clubbing, anaemia, lymphadenopathy or jaundice. Her height is on the 25th  删除换行1: centile and her weight is on the 9th centile. She is prepubertal.

This is a benign, very common but potentially debilitating condition. The  删除换行1: pointers to this not being organic are the chronicity of the characteristic symptoms in an  删除换行1: otherwise healthy, physically active child. The commonest identifiable cause for RAP is psy删除8：<u>￾</u>chosomatic, as seems likely from Danielle’s description with many recent changes in her life. \n\n【27】However, RAP is a diagnosis of exclusion and investigations exclude conditions that can have  删除换行1: an insidious onset, such as coeliac disease, and reassure the child and family that there is no  删除换行1: sinister cause.

When ranibizumab is injected into the vitreous it has stabilized loss of vision and， in some cases， improved vision in individuals with neovascular age-related macular degeneration.\n\n【54】●Bevacizumab， a monoclonal antibody to VEGF used intravenously as an anticancer agent， is also increasingly being used off-label as intrav-itreal therapy for neovascular age-related macular degeneration.\n\n【55】● Photodynamic to reduce angiogenesis involves the use of an intrave-nously administered light-sensitive ddye，Vverteporfin(Visudyne， 删除换行3: Novartis)， that preferentially concentrates in new blood vessels and is activated with the use of a 689 nm laser beam focused over the macula. It causes localized choroidal neovascular thrombosis through a non-thermal chemotoxic reaction.\n\n【56】Pegaptanib， an anti-VEGF therapy， appears to be effective.\n\n【57】C Triple therapy： intravitreal anti-VEGF agent， intravitreal dexametha-sone and photodynamic therapy is also currently under investigation.\n\n【58】· Adenoviral vector-mediated intravitreal gene transfer of pigment-epithelium-derived factor (an antiangiogenic cytokine) appears to help to arrest the growth of choroidal neovascularization.\n\n【59】●Implantation of artificial intraocular devices (miniature telescopes) might improve the quality of life of patients with severe visual loss from end-stage disease.\n\n【60】Implantation of electrical stimulated devices targeting the optic nerve and cortical， subretinal and epiretinal areas has led to the perception of phosphenes (discrete， reproducible perceptions of light) and is under investigation.\n\n【61】How is the neovascularization treated?\n\n【62】·Laser photocoagulation of regions outside the foveal avascular zone●Subfoveal neovascularization： photocoagulated is associated with a treatment-induced visual loss immediately but in the long term is found to be beneficial.

The conventional argon laser has blue and green wavelengths. The green wavelength is absorbed by haemoglobin and may damage the retina， while the blue wavelength is absorbed by the macular xanthophyll and results in foveal damage.\n\n【72】Argon laser photocoagulation therapy was once the most common therapy for neovascular age-related macular degeneration. It is now used only occasionally to treat choroidal neovascularization that extends by>200 um from the centre of the macula， since this therapy can create a large retinal scar， which is itself associated with permanent visual loss.\n\n【73】Mention some drugs that can cause maculopathy\n\n【74】Q QChloroquine， thioridazine， chlorpromazine.\n\n【75】删除6：<u>This page intentionally left blank</u>\n\n【76】MiscelaneoUS Examination of the foot\n\n【77】INSPECTION\n\n【78】Comment on deformity： hallux valgus ， pes cavus\n\n【79】Skin： comment on the colour， ulcers and gangrene， hair loss (remember that hair loss is not a reliable sign of ischaemia)\n\n【80】●Joint： comment on the swelling， e.g. ankle joint， first metatarsophalan-geal joint in gout\n\n【81】· Ask the patient whether the foot is sore\n\n【82】· Feel for temperature difference between the two feet\n\n【83】· Pulses： dorsalis pedis and posterior tibials (compare with the other side)\n\n【84】Sensation： check light touch， pain and joint sensation\n\n【85】Check the plantar response and the ankle jerk.\n\n【86】A： No ulcer but high-risk foot (e.g. deformity， callus， insensitivity).

However, the examination findings and investigations reduce  删除换行1: the number of possibilities significantly. The investigations reveal a normocytic anaemia  删除换行1: with an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), possibly suggesting haemolytic anaemia,  删除换行1: with a borderline thrombocytopenia and positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) test, against  删除换行1: the background of normal thyroid, renal and liver function. ANA positivity is not specific  删除换行1: for any particular autoimmune disease but does raise this possibility. In this case, ANA posi删除8：<u>￾</u>tivity points towards a differential of autoimmune or connective tissue disorders, including  删除换行1: systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis, mixed connective  删除换行1: tissue disease, Sjögren’s syndrome and inflammatory myopathies such as dermatomyositis  删除换行1: and polymyositis. \n\n【28】This patient meets the 2019 European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology/American \n\n【29】College of Rheumatology (EULAR/ACR) classification criteria for the diagnosis of SLE, as  删除换行1: she has a positive ANA along with 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> arthritis, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> neurologic symptoms and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> haemolytic  删除换行1: anaemia. While SLE can be putatively diagnosed with these conditions, further investiga删除8：<u>￾</u>tions would be useful in confirming this. In particular, specific autoantibodies for SLE (e.g.  删除换行1: anti-dsDNA and anti-SmAg) would be helpful in making the diagnosis. Given the history of  删除换行1: a miscarriage, antiphospholipid antibodies could be tested to exclude lupus anticoagulant  删除换行1: syndrome. \n\n【30】The pathogenesis of SLE is not well understood, with genetic, environmental, hormonal and  删除换行1: immunoregulatory factors all playing a part in the ultimate breakdown of self-tolerance,  删除换行1: which leads to organ injury. One theory is that a defect in clearance of apoptotic or necrotic  删除换行1: cells leads to the sensitisation of T and B cells to intracellular antigens, triggering the autoim删除8：<u>￾</u>mune process. For example, deficiencies of early complement components (C1q, C4), which  删除换行1: are important for these clearance processes, produce an SLE-like syndrome. Other hypoth删除8：<u>￾</u>eses include aberrant T-cell signal transduction, as well as overexpression of particular cyto删除8：<u>￾</u>kines (in particular, type I interferons). \n\n【31】Tissue injury in SLE is immune complex mediated (type III hypersensitivity) as a result of  删除换行1: defective clearance of apoptotic or necrotic cells due to deficiency of Fc and complement  删除换行1: receptors. The most important complication arises in the kidney, where immune complex  删除换行1: accumulation stimulates secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by mesangial cells and  删除换行1: podocytes, giving rise to lupus nephritis. About 50% of patients develop clinically evident  删除换行1: renal disease, which carries substantial morbidity if severe. Further complications of SLE \n\n【32】include an increased cardiovascular risk due to accelerated atherogenesis arising from  删除换行1: inflammatory damage to the endothelium. While the prognosis is variable, depending on the  删除换行1: extent of organ involvement, current treatments are reasonably effective, with 10-year overall  删除换行1: survival greater than 90%. \n\n【33】KEY POINTS \n\n【34】• A positive ANA does not definitively indicate the presence of an autoimmune con删除8：<u>￾</u>dition but should prompt suspicion of such. \n\n【35】• SLE is a multi-system autoimmune disorder whose presentation is protean. \n\n【36】• The most important complication of SLE is kidney damage, which may affect up to  删除换行1: half of all patients and carries substantial morbidity.  \n\n【37】 ", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:50:34", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:50:47", "cost": 12.996}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:03", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:50:47", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:50:34"}

Bilirubin is produced by degradation of haem and is initially  删除换行1: unconjugated, and hence water-insoluble. Unconjugated bilirubin is transported, bound to  删除换行1: albumin and is conjugated in the liver parenchymal cells to make it water-soluble and excre删除8：<u>￾</u>table in bile. Conjugated bilirubin is excreted and converted to urobilinogen, urobilin and  删除换行1: stercobilinogen in the gut, which can be reabsorbed, leading to the enterohepatic circula删除8：<u>￾</u>tion of bile pigments. These pigments give stool its normal coloration. If there is increased  删除换行1: unconjugated bilirubin production from increased red cell destruction (e.g. haemolysis), then  删除换行1: there will be jaundice with normally pigmented stool and urine. If there is obstruction to  删除换行1: bile excretion (e.g. common bile duct stone), conjugated bilirubin accumulates (which causes  删除换行1: itching), overflows into urine (causing it to appear dark), and does not reach the gut (result删除8：<u>￾</u>ing in pale stools). Hepatic causes may produce a combination of these patterns. Thus it is  删除换行1: important to ask about stool and urine colour, as well as factors that may pre-dispose to each  删除换行1: type of cause. In this case, a full travel history is necessary and additional questions should  删除换行1: be asked about pre-travel immunization and drug history.\n删除26：<u>!</u> Differential diagnosis of abdominal pain and jaundice \n\n【22】Pre-hepatic\n\n【23】• Abdominal pain is an uncommon feature\n\n【24】• Possible causes: malaria, sickle cell crisis\n\n【25】Hepatic\n\n【26】• Often pale stools and dark urine will be present\n\n【27】• Acute hepatitis due to infection, drugs, toxins\n\n【28】Post-hepatic\n\n【29】• Pale stools and dark urine\n\n【30】• Bile duct stones, cholecystitis, choledochal cyst\n\n【31】• Cholangitis must be considered in a febrile child\n\n【32】Additional tests should include urine dipstick to confirm bilirubinuria, amylase, determination  删除换行1: of the conjugated and unconjugated fractions of serum bilirubin, serological investigation for  删除换行1: viral hepatitis (most importantly, hepatitis A IgM), a clotting profile and abdominal ultrasound.\n\n【33】The most likely diagnosis is hepatitis A, which is uncommon in the United Kingdom, but  删除换行1: endemic throughout much of the world, and is most likely to cause symptomatic acute hepa删除8：<u>￾</u>titis in older children and adults. There is usually a flu-like prodromal phase, with nausea and  删除换行1: anorexia starting 2–6 weeks after exposure, followed by an icteric phase when there may be  删除换行1: tender hepatomegaly. Usually children make a complete recovery. Other infections (e.g. hep删除8：<u>￾</u>atitis B, or C, and Epstein–Barr virus) can also cause acute hepatitis, but are less common.\n\n【34】Hepatitis A can be prevented by immunization and good hygiene practices, as it is transmit删除8：<u>￾</u>ted by the faeco-oral route.

Cabbage odor/rancid butter odor and presence of succinylacetone in the urine is the characteristic finding seen in tyrosinemia type I， a disorder of tyrosine catabolic pathway. This is also known as hepatorenal tyrosinemia as it involved liver and kidnev predominantly as seen in above illustrative case as well. Presentation of this disorder in early (first three months of life)， and baby commonly presents with failure to thrive and hepatorenal involvement.\n\n【9】A.ns.2. The pathway involved is tyrosine catabolism and the enzyme deficient is fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH). This enzyme is required at last step of tyrosine catabolism to finally degrade the fumarylacetoacetate to fumaric acid and acetoacetic acid. In deficiency of this enzyme， maleylacetoacetate and fumarylacetoacetate are converted to succinylacetoacetate which then is converted to succinvlacetone and gets excreted in urine.\n\n【10】删除3：<u>Fig. 1： Pathwav of tyrosine degradation and step involved in tyrosinemia type l.

Orthostatic hypotension is defined as a 20 mm Hg drop in systolic blood pressure or a 10 mm Hg drop in diastolic blood pressure from supine to standing position. When it is due to volume depletion， the postural hypotension is often accompanied by an increase in pulse rate >20/min.

The breast examination reveals a 1.5-cm， mobile， nontender mass of the upper outer quadrant of the right breast. No adenopathy or skin changes are appreciated. Mammography and ultrasound examinations of the breasts are normal.\n\n【5】Next step： Core needle biopsy.\n\n【6】ANALYSIS\n\n【7】Objectives\n\n【8】1\\. Understand that a dominant breast mass requires tissue for histologic analysis.\n\n【9】2\\. Understand that the age of the patient is usually the biggest risk factor for breast cancer.\n\n【10】3\\. Understand that normal imaging of a palpable breast mass does not rule out cancer.\n\n【11】Considerations\n\n【12】This 50-year-old woman came in for a well-woman examination. The physical examination is aimed at screening for common and/or serious conditions， such as hypertension， thyroid disease， cervical cancer (Pap smear)， colon cancer (stool for occult blood)， and breast cancer. A single 1.5-cm breast mass is palpated， with-out any associated skin changes， such as nipple retraction or dimpling of the skin. There is no associated adenopathy. Furthermore， the imaging tests (mammography and ultrasonography) are normal. Despite the normal imaging， there is a possibility that the breast mass is malignant. Therefore， biopsy of the mass is indicated.\n\n【13】The usual approach is a core needle biopsy based on palpation.Fine-needle aspi-ration is an acceptable diagnostic modality， but would not be able to discern ductal carcinoma in situ versus invasion. Needle biopsy is usually preferred rather than excision to better plan future surgeries. The combination of the clinical examina-tion， the imaging， and the needle biopsy is called the triple test. When all three tests agree (benign or malignant)， this concordant result is >99% accurate. If any one parameter suggests cancer， even in the face of the other two being negative， most experts will recommend excision of the mass to assess for malignancy.\n\n【14】APPROACHTO：\n\n【15】Breast Masses\n\n【16】DEFINITIONS\n\n【17】DOMINANT BREAST MASS： A mass that， on palpation， is felt to be separate from the remainder of the breast tissue.\n\n【18】EXCISIONAL BIOPSY： Surgical procedure removing the entire mass.\n\n【19】SENTINEL NODE BIOPSY： Removal and examination of the first lymph nodes that cancer cells are likely to spread from the primary tumor， determined by inject-ing radioactive or color dye near the tumor， and probing the lymph nodes which are affected.\n\n【20】SKIN DIMPLING： Retraction of the skin， which is suspicious for an underlying malignancy， due to the cancer being fixed or pulling on the skin.\n\n【21】BRCA GENE MUTATIONS： BRCA1 gene is located on chromosome 17 and BRCA2 gene is located on chromosome 13. These are tumor suppressor genes， such that a mutation in the gene confers a markedly increased risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer.\n\n【22】INFLAMMATORY BREAST CANCER： A rare but aggressive type of breast can-cer in which the cancer cells obstruct the lymphatic vessels of the skin and subder-mal breast tissue.The presentation is warmth and redness and diagnosed by biopsy.\n\n【23】Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women， excluding skin cancer. It is the second leading cause of female cancer deaths in the United States， exceeded only by lung cancer. It is also the most frequently diagnosed cause of death from cancer in women worldwide. Established risk factors for breast cancer include age， per-sonal or family history of breast cancer or precancerous lesions， reproductive fac-tors (early menarche and late menopause)， hormonal treatment， postmenopausal obesity， alcohol consumption， exposure to ionizing radiation， and genetic predispo-sition. The prevalence of breast cancer is age specific， and age is the most important risk factor. One in 2500 women will develop breast cancer at the age of 20 years； whereas 1 in 30 women will develop breast cancer at the age of 60 years， giving an overall lifetime risk of 1 in 8.\n\n【24】Early diagnosis improves survival. One common way breast cancer is first dis-covered is a mass palpated by the patient. Unfortunately， this frequently occurs at an advanced stage. Routine screening is preferable. Clinical breast examination every 3 years should be performed for women from ages 20 to 39 years. Routine self-breast examination is no longer recommended due to false positive rates； however， breast self awareness still has utility. In other words， the patient may be aware of the texture and consistency of her breasts and should report changes. Women over the age of 40 years should have a yearly clinical breast examination and 删除换行1: mammography according to ACOG (The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists) and American Cancer Society guidelines. In contrast， the United States Preventive Services Task Force recommend biennial mammography in women aged 50-74 years. However， mammography may be performed sooner if risk factors warrant the need. In general， age is the most significant risk factor for breast cancer， but other parameters are important to consider.\n\n【25】Mammograms carry a false-negative rate of up to 10%. Thus， any palpable domi-nant mass， regardless of mammographic findings， requires histologic diagnosis.\n\n【26】Other imaging methods include breast ultrasound (handled or automated)，tomo-synthesis， magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (with or without the administration of contrast material)， positron-emission tomography， and positron-emission mam-mography. Those technologies are not alternatives to mammography for women with average risk of breast cancer.\n\n【27】Ultrasonography is an established adjunct to mammography， useful in evaluat-ing young patients and other women with dense breast tissue and in differentiating a cyst from a solid mass. Magnetic resonance is the recommended imaging modality for screening women with 20% or greater lifetime risk of breast cancer including women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation according to the American cancer society.\n\n【28】If a mammogram detects a suspicious lesion， a biopsy is usually performed. For nonpalpable lesions， the biopsy requires ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy or stereotactic core needle biopsy. In selected cases， excisional biopsy with needle localization may be required.\n\n【29】Nearly 30% of breast cancers have some familial component， but <10% are caused by inherited mutations in major breast cancer susceptibility genes. A patient who has two first-degree relatives with breast cancer is a candidate for genetic test-ing， such as BRCAl and BRCA2 testing.

Molony， PhD， APRN， GNP-BC\n\n【1】SUBJECTIVE\n\n【2】Antonio is an 84-year-old male resident of a continuing care retirement community (CCRC). The residential director admitted him to the nursing home respite care wing last evening due to behavior changes including agitation， disorientation， and wandering outside without appropriate clothing. The director brings him to the on-site clinic the next morning. She reports that the clinician on call last evening ordered 1mg of IM haloperidol， which was given soon after the resident came to the unit. The residential director reports that Antonio had a poor appetite for a few days before this and was found napping in the lounge， which is not unusual. He fell on his way to the dining room on the previous morning， but he sustained no apparent injury. During his last annual health maintenance visit 3 months prior， he scored 26/30 on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and 22/30 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and was diagnosed with \"mild cognitive impairment(MCI).\" He is usually alert and oriented to season， year， place， and person and has no difficulty navi-gating inside and outside his residence.\n\n【3】His only complaint today is a new complaint of frequent heartburn that he has been treating with over-the-counter (OTC) pills (he can't remember the name). He denies pain， cough， shortness of breath， or changes in bladder/ bowel habits.\n\n【4】Past medical history： Coronary artery disease (CAD) with angioplasty /stent placement x2， hyper-tension (HTN)， benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH)， asthma， hyperlipidemia (HLD)， heart failure with normal ejection fraction (HFNEF)， mild cognitive impairment (MCI)， osteopenia， and osteoar-thritis (OA). He had a motorcycle accident in his youth with a left leg injury.\n\n【5】Psychosocial history： Antonio moved to the CCRC one year ago with his wife， who died 4 months prior. He cared for her until she died， then stayed in his apartment， complaining of anxiety and dif-ficulty sleeping. He recently became more involved in community activities and has been making friendships in the building. He has been attending two meals per day in the communal dining room， until this week， and has been independent in bathing， dressing， grooming， walking， transferring， eating， and toileting. He does not climb stairs due to poor endurance but is able to walk on level ground over modest distances without fatigue. Before his wife died， he would take the community van to local shops twice a month. He has a daughter-in-law and two nieces who live within 50 miles， call weekly， and visit once or twice a month.\n\n【6】Clinical Case Studies for the Family Nurse Practitioner， First Edition.

Molony， PhD， APRN， GNP-BC\n\n【1】SUBJECTIVE\n\n【2】Antonio is an 84-year-old male resident of a continuing care retirement community (CCRC). The residential director admitted him to the nursing home respite care wing last evening due to behavior changes including agitation， disorientation， and wandering outside without appropriate clothing. The director brings him to the on-site clinic the next morning. She reports that the clinician on call last evening ordered 1mg of IM haloperidol， which was given soon after the resident came to the unit. The residential director reports that Antonio had a poor appetite for a few days before this and was found napping in the lounge， which is not unusual. He fell on his way to the dining room on the previous morning， but he sustained no apparent injury. During his last annual health maintenance visit 3 months prior， he scored 26/30 on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and 22/30 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and was diagnosed with \"mild cognitive impairment(MCI).\" He is usually alert and oriented to season， year， place， and person and has no difficulty navi-gating inside and outside his residence.\n\n【3】His only complaint today is a new complaint of frequent heartburn that he has been treating with over-the-counter (OTC) pills (he can't remember the name). He denies pain， cough， shortness of breath， or changes in bladder/ bowel habits.\n\n【4】Past medical history： Coronary artery disease (CAD) with angioplasty /stent placement x2， hyper-tension (HTN)， benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH)， asthma， hyperlipidemia (HLD)， heart failure with normal ejection fraction (HFNEF)， mild cognitive impairment (MCI)， osteopenia， and osteoar-thritis (OA). He had a motorcycle accident in his youth with a left leg injury.\n\n【5】Psychosocial history： Antonio moved to the CCRC one year ago with his wife， who died 4 months prior. He cared for her until she died， then stayed in his apartment， complaining of anxiety and dif-ficulty sleeping. He recently became more involved in community activities and has been making friendships in the building. He has been attending two meals per day in the communal dining room， until this week， and has been independent in bathing， dressing， grooming， walking， transferring， eating， and toileting. He does not climb stairs due to poor endurance but is able to walk on level ground over modest distances without fatigue. Before his wife died， he would take the community van to local shops twice a month. He has a daughter-in-law and two nieces who live within 50 miles， call weekly， and visit once or twice a month.\n\n【6】Clinical Case Studies for the Family Nurse Practitioner， First Edition.

When you walk into the room, he is lying on the examination table, on his side, with his arm covering his eyes. The light in the room is off. You look at his chart and see that the nurse recorded his temperature as 102.3°F, heart rate 110 bpm, and blood pressure 120/80 mm Hg. When you gently ask how he has been feeling, he says that for the past 3 days he has had fever, body aches, and a progressively worsening headache. The light hurts his eyes and he is nauseated, but he has not vomited. He has had some rhinorrhea, but no diarrhea, cough, or nasal congestion. He has no known ill contacts. On examination, he has no skin rash, but his pupils are difficult to assess because of photophobia. Ears and oropharynx are normal. Heart, lung, and abdomen examinations are normal. Neurologic examination reveals no focal neurologic deficits, but passive flexion of his neck worsens his headache, and he is unable to touch his chin to his chest.\n\n【3】 What condition are you concerned about?\n\n【4】 What diagnostic test would confirm the diagnosis?\n\n【5】### ANSWERS TO CASE 29:\n\n【6】#### Bacterial Meningitis\n\n【7】Summary: A 20-year-old college student presents with a 3-day history of fever, headache, myalgias, and nausea. He has no respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms, but now has developed photophobia. He is febrile to 102.3°F, tachycardic, and normotensive. His physical examination is generally unremarkable with a nonfocal neurologic examination but some neck stiffness, suggesting meningeal irritation. He has no skin lesions as might be seen in meningococcemia.\n\n【8】 Most likely condition: Meningitis\n\n【9】 Diagnostic test to confirm diagnosis: Lumbar puncture (LP) for evaluation of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), possibly preceded by a computed tomographic (CT) scan of the head\n\n【10】#### ANALYSIS\n\n【11】##### Objectives\n\n【12】1\\. Be familiar with the clinical presentations of viral and bacterial meningitis.\n\n【13】2\\. Know that LP is the diagnostic test of choice for meningitis.\n\n【14】3\\. Be familiar with the treatment for meningitis.\n\n【15】##### Considerations\n\n【16】This 20-year-old college student has headache, nausea, photophobia, fever, and neck pain and stiffness—all suggestive of meningitis, which could be bacterial or viral. Prompt LP and analysis of CSF are essential to establish the diagnosis. In a patient without focal neurologic signs and a normal level of consciousness, CT scan may be unnecessary prior to performing an LP. If he had a purpuric skin rash, one would be suspicious of Neisseria meningitis, and appropriate antibiotics should be administered immediately. Dosing of antibiotics in suspected meningococcal infection should not await the performance of any diagnostic test because progression of the disease is rapid, and mortality and morbidity are extremely high even when antibiotics are given in a timely manner.\n\n【17】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【18】#### Suspected Meningitis\n\n【19】#### DEFINITIONS\n\n【20】MENINGITIS: Inflammation of the subarachnoid space and meninges, most often infectious, can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, or protozoa.\n\n【21】PAPILLEDEMA: Swelling of the optic nerve, caused by an increased intracranial pressure. On funduscopic examination, the optic disc margin appears hazy.\n\n【22】ENCEPHALITIS : Brain parenchymal injury and inflammation most often due to a virus. When focal brain parenchymal infection is caused by bacteria, it is usually termed cerebritis or abscess .\n\n【23】### CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【24】Bacterial meningitis is the most common pus-forming intracranial infection, with an incidence of 2.5 per 10 000 persons. The microbiology of the disease has changed somewhat since the introduction of the Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccine in the 1980s. Now Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common bacterial isolate , with Neisseria meningitidis a close second. Group B Streptococcus or S agalactiae occurs in approximately 10% of cases, more frequently in neonates or in patients older than 50 years or with chronic illnesses such as diabetes or liver disease. Listeria monocytogenes accounts for approximately 10% of cases and must be considered in pregnant women, the elderly , or patients with impaired cell-mediated immunity such as AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) patients. H influenzae is responsible for less than 10% of meningitis cases. Resistance to penicillin and some cephalosporins is now of great concern in the treatment of S pneumoniae .\n\n【25】Bacteria usually seed the meninges hematogenously after colonizing and invading the nasal or oropharyngeal mucosa. Occasionally, bacteria directly invade the intracranial space from a site of abscess formation in the middle ear or sinuses. The gravity and rapidity of progression of disease depend upon both host defense and organism virulence characteristics. For example, patients with defects in the complement cascade are more susceptible to invasive meningococcal disease. Patients with CSF rhinorrhea caused by trauma or postsurgical changes may also be more susceptible to bacterial invasion.\n\n【26】Staphylococcus aureus and S epidermidis are common causes of meningitis in patients following neurologic procedures such as placement of ventriculoperitoneal shunts . The brisk host inflammatory response in the subarachnoid space may cause edema, vasculitis, and coagulation of vessels, leading to severe neurologic complications including seizures, increased intracranial pressure, and stroke. Acute bacterial meningitis can progress over hours to days. Typical symptoms include fever, neck stiffness, and headache. Patients may also complain of photophobia, nausea and vomiting, and more nonspecific constitutional symptoms. Approximately 75% of patients will experience some confusion or altered level of consciousness. Forty percent may experience seizures during the course of their illness.\n\n【27】Some physical examination findings may be useful in the evaluation of a patient with suspected meningitis. Nuchal rigidity is demonstrated when passive or active flexion of the neck results in an inability to touch the chin to the chest. Classic tests include Kernig and Brudzinski signs. Kernig sign can be elicited with the patient on his or her back. The hip and knees are flexed. The knee is then passively extended, and the test is positive if this maneuver elicits pain. Brudzinski sign is positive if the supine patient flexes the knees and hips when the neck is passively flexed. Neither sign is very sensitive for the presence of meningeal irritation, but, if present, both are highly specific. Papilledema , if present, would indicate increased intracranial pressure , and focal neurologic signs or altered level of consciousness or seizures may reflect ischemia of the cerebral vasculature or focal suppuration.\n\n【28】##### Differential Diagnosis\n\n【29】The differential diagnosis of bacterial meningitis is fairly limited and can be narrowed depending upon the patient’s age, as discussed earlier, exposure history, and course of illness. Various viral infections may also cause meningitis. These include enteroviruses , which tend to be more common in the summer and fall, when patients may present with severe headache, accompanied by symptoms of gastroenteritis. The CSF white blood cell (WBC) count will be elevated , with a predominance of lymphocytes , and usually glucose and protein levels are normal  . Either herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 or HSV-2 can cause herpes simplex meningitis. The CSF of these patients will also have a normal glucose level, whereas protein and WBC counts will be elevated with a predominance of lymphocytes. Typically, these patients have a high CSF red blood cell count, which is not seen in bacterial meningitis in the absence of a traumatic spinal tap. In a patient with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, fungal meningitis, specifically caused by Cryptococcus , should be considered. Tuberculous meningitis presents subacutely and is more common in older, debilitated patients, or in patients with HIV. Rickettsial disease, specifically Rocky Mountain spotted fever, may also present with meningitis. Intracranial empyema, or brain or epidural abscess, should be considered, especially if the patient has focal neurologic findings. The one nonsuppurative diagnosis in the differential is subarachnoid hemorrhage . These patients present with sudden onset of the “worst headache of their lives” in the absence of other symptoms of infection. They may have photophobia, and the CSF will be grossly bloody; the supernatant will be xanthochromic, reflecting the breakdown of blood into bilirubin.\n\n【30】Blood cultures should be obtained in all patients with suspected meningitis. Critical to the diagnosis of meningitis is the LP and evaluation of the CSF. Table 29–1 lists typical findings in the CSF from various causes of meningitis.\n\n【31】The necessity of imaging of the head and brain prior to performing an LP is controversial. Studies show that in the patient with suspected meningitis who does not have papilledema, focal neurologic signs, or altered level of consciousness, an LP may be safely performed without preceding imaging. However, in instances in which performance of the LP may be delayed, antibiotics should be administered after blood cultures while awaiting the radiologic studies. Ideally, the CSF should be examined within 30 minutes of antibiotics, but it has been shown that if the LP is performed within 2 hours of antibiotic administration, it will not significantly alter the CSF protein, glucose, or WBC count, or Gram stain. If CSF is obtained, a culture and Gram stain should be sent. If enough fluid is available, it should also be sent for cell count and glucose and protein levels. Latex agglutination tests for S pneumoniae and H influenzae can be useful in patients pretreated with antibiotics, and, although not very sensitive, they are highly specific. If positive they can establish the infectious agent. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing is available for some bacteria; however, it may be more useful in the diagnosis of herpes simplex, enteroviral, or tuberculous meningitis. In all, no more than 3.5 to 4 mL of CSF is necessary. The most critical issue in a patient with suspected bacterial meningitis, however, is the initiation of antibiotics. The CSF examination and imaging studies can be deferred in this medical emergency.\n删除4：<u>Table 29–1 • CSF CHARACTERISTICS OF MENINGITIS</u>\n\n【32】During the course of treatment, most patients will undergo some cerebral imaging studies. Computed tomographic (CT) scans are most useful in the initial presentation to exclude intracranial mass or bleeding, or to evaluate for other signs of increased intracranial pressure. However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is most helpful for demonstrating any focal ischemia or infarction caused by the disease. When HSV meningitis is suspected, MRI should demonstrate enhancement of the temporal lobes . In tuberculous meningitis, enhancement of the basal region may be seen. An electroencephalogram (EEG) may be helpful in patients suspected of HSV meningitis. Within 2 to 15 days of the start of the illness, periodic sharp and slow wave complexes originating within the temporal lobes can be demonstrated at 2- to 3-second intervals. When the purpuric skin lesions are present, skin biopsy may demonstrate N meningitidis and can be helpful in the diagnosis. Age may give a clue regarding etiology of meningitis .\n删除4：<u>Table 29–2 • ETIOLOGIES OF BACTERIAL MENINGITIS BY AGE</u>\n\n【33】##### Therapy\n\n【34】Treatment of meningitis often is empiric until specific culture data are available. Because of the growing incidence of resistant pneumococci as well as meningococci, the recommended empiric therapy in most areas is a high-dose third-generation cephalosporin given concurrently with vancomycin . In other areas, if the disease presentation is typical for meningococcus (with the typical rash) or the organism is identified quickly on Gram stain of the CSF, therapy with high-dose penicillin can be started if the meningococcus in that area is known to be sensitive. Ampicillin is added when there is a suspicion of listeriosis. Acyclovir should be started for suspicion of HSV , or four-drug antituberculosis (TB) therapy should be started if the presentation is suspicious for tuberculous meningitis. The administration of glucocorticoids to reduce CNS (central nervous system) inflammation is controversial. One study in adults demonstrated decreased mortality in patients with S pneumoniae meningitis who were given glucocorticoids. There are stronger data supporting steroids for H influenzae and S pneumoniae meningitis in children. There is also some evidence for benefit of steroids in severe tuberculous meningitis.\n\n【35】Prevention of meningitis can be achieved through the administration of vaccines and chemoprophylaxis of close contacts. Specific vaccinations are available for H influenzae type B and some strains of S pneumoniae and are now routinely administered to children . Meningococcal vaccination is recommended for those living in dormitory situations, such as college students and military recruits, but not for the general population. Rifampin given twice daily for 2 days or a single dose of ciprofloxacin is recommended for household and close contacts of an index case of meningococcemia or meningococcal meningitis .\n\n【36】####", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 13:48:47", "endTime": "2024/09/14 13:49:51", "cost": 63.536}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:03", "update_time": "2024-09-13 21:49:50", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 21:48:46"}

The symptomatic presentation in the first months after the infection may often be mistaken for other diseases, especially mononucleosis infectiosa ( Morbus. Pfeiffer ), viral or bacterial pharyngitis . COVID-19 may be also considered due to the present pandemic; however possible co-infection is a real possibility. Although the presentation may be very similar, the treatments differ widely. Also, the prognosis is totally different. Therefore, a correct diagnosis is of pivotal importance. Furthermore, any delay in getting the correct diagnosis may affect the short-term and long-term prognosis for the patient. The delay may be prevented or even come to exist if the clues in the initial assessment of the patient are overlooked. Especially thorough medical history taking may point in the correct direction, since risk factors directing the differential diagnosis are most prominent in the medical history, especially the personal behavior of the patient. However, even when the correct direction toward the correct diagnosis is taken, using the appropriate statistical considerations and properties of the diagnostic tools involved may make the difference between the ultimate correct diagnosis and a misdiagnosis. That is the case with the following case report. Although one case report is discussed, the misdiagnosis of HIV-1 as especially mononucleosis infectiosa or acute pharyngiti s is not rare. Furthermore, it illustrates that besides the personal consequences for the patient, also the public health consequences may be far reaching if the probability of a misdiagnosis is partially based on a testing tool that is widely used although inappropriate for the acute phase of the disease.\n\n【25】Clinical Case Presentation\n--------------------------\n\n【26】This case report concerns the initial presentation of a 29-year-old man, initially diagnosed, by his general practitioner and also a second general practitioner he visited 1 day later, with pharyngitis , based on his presentation with sore throat, weakness, chills, a temperature of 38.5° C, and pain in the left arm and leg 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Despite prescribed antibiotics and paracetamol by the first general practitioner and confirmation by the second, the symptoms persisted. Because of fears emerging from his recent unprotected sexual activities, the patient sought HIV testing after 7 days, with a first fourth-generation test being reactive (positive), followed by four consecutive negative tests, all being third-generation HIV tests in, respectively, two primary care settings, one Public AIDS Counseling Center and one AIDS-NGO facility. Subsequently the patient underwent again a fifth HIV test, this time again using the fourth-generation test at the original laboratory of the first positive fourth-generation test result, and also this time the fourth-generation test was positive. However, confirmation by a third-generation Western blot test, in a reference laboratory, again was negative. Based on the long testing history and the history of the patient, a thorough physical examination and a fourth-generation further testing eventually led to the correct diagnosis of acute retroviral syndrome, undergoing seroconversion, with HIV-1 RNA viral load of more than 3,000,000 copies/mL.\n\n【27】Differential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【28】Given the medical history of the patient, the most probable differential diagnosis could be:\n\n【29】1.  1.\n\n【30】    Acute retroviral syndrome: The patient presentation with pharyngitis , chills, myalgia, and lymphadenopathy, together with a history of recent risky unprotected sexual behavior, is the typical presentation of the acute retroviral syndrome as consequence of an acute HIV infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In a study done by Crowell and coworkers in which they reported the signs and symptoms in patients with acute human immunodeficiency virus infection, 335 of 430 study participants had ARS . In the 335 ARS subjects, 93% presented with fever, 79% with fatigue, 67% with pharyngitis , 64% with headache, and 57% with myalgia, while 18% presented with adenopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】2.  2.\n\n【32】    Mononucleosis infectiosa: The presentation with adenopathy, and the other symptoms, raises a high suggestion of mononucleosis infectiosa , especially in young patients. However, given the history of multiple unprotected sexual contacts with males, this is to be considered in conjunction with acute HIV, which should be excluded. Furthermore, specific laboratory tests should manifest the presence of the typical mononuclear lymphocytes.\n\n【33】3.  3.\n\n【34】    COVID-19: The pandemic of COVID-19 causes a high prevalence of COVID-19 and therefore increases the probability that patients presenting with fever, chills, myalgia, and weakness may have COVID-19. However, despite the wide range of symptoms and signs COVID-19 presents itself with, Struyf and coworkers reported in a review of 44 studies involving a total of 26,884 patients a sensitivity of 0.00% for adenopathy, which means that 0.00% of the COVID-19 cases presented with adenopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Also, a review done by Rahman and coworkers in 2021 made no mention of adenopathy as part of COVID-19’s first presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Therefore, the presence of adenopathy takes COVID-19 lower down the differential diagnosis list, although it may not be excluded as a co-infection with HIV 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【35】4.  4.\n\n【36】    Acute bacterial pharyngitis : Based on the symptoms and the pharyngitis , combined with fever, and cervical adenopathy, a pharyngitis seems at first hand probable. However, the overall picture of myalgia and general weakness and especially the rare presentation of isolated bacterial pharyngitis in adults should push the diagnosis and treatment of the pharyngitis to a “per exclusionem” category, i.e. after exclusion of other causes. Furthermore, in adults, pharyngitis seldom presents as an isolated illness but rather as a part of a wider spectrum of diseases or syndromes. Also, when assuming an isolated pharyngitis , treatment with antibiotics, if done, is to be preceded by a culture, in order to evaluate the choice. Here, the absence of any effect within 48–72 hours and, surely after 1 week, worsening of the symptoms should raise suspicion on the diagnosis, the treatment, or both.\n\n【37】What Was Misdiagnosed in This Case and Why?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【38】HIV was misdiagnosed as pharyngitis , since the initial rapid antigen detection test 2 months before symptoms, as well as the four third-generation HIV tests performed 7 days after the onset of his symptoms, which resulted negative after one fourth-generation HIV test was reactive. Afterward, the fourth-generation was reactive again, but again the Western blot confirmation test used after the second fourth-generation rapid test resulted negative. The misdiagnosis resulted from the use of third-generation HIV antibody tests as either rapid tests or as confirmation tests, since they are not able to detect HIV in the early acute phase, disregarding the probability of false negatives in the acute phase of HIV. Also, important details in the medical history of the patient were disregarded, and adequately performed physical examination was missing or incomplete.\n\n【39】Discussion\n----------\n\n【40】The procedure to reach eventually a diagnosis consists of different fundamental steps, which all should be considered integrally to yield eventually the correct diagnosis. One of the fundamental conditions is that the natural history of the diseases that is contemplated must be completely understood, especially the different potentially misleading presentations it may carry along. However this is not sufficient, since the eventual detection and confirmation of the disease depend on the diagnostic tools used, their appropriateness, and their ability to predict a disease reliably in the phase the disease is actually presenting itself. The characteristic of especially the positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the diagnostic tools used and their interpretation by the physician will in the end play a pivotal role in preventing a misdiagnosis. When it concerns the different steps leading to a diagnosis, the first starting points are found in the medical history, and every detail must be weighed by the physician, in search of pathognomonic symptoms and signs, relevant patient behavior, and observations of the patient by others. Furthermore, the applicability and especially the limitations of all diagnostic tools involved must be well known. It must always be clear which diagnostic tool is able to detect disease, and in which phases of the disease. Furthermore results must be evaluated keeping in mind the possibility of false positive but especially also false-negative test results. In the subsequent case, the consequences of overlooking important information in the medical history, the absence of an optimal physical examination, and application of a diagnostic tool that is not reliable in the early stage of HIV led to a misdiagnosis by two general physicians and a doctor’s delay of 11 days. It was only when the clear indications in the medical history and an adequate physical examination were taken into account, also in combination of the correct laboratory diagnostic tools, that the correct diagnosis was reached.\n\n【41】### Natural History of Acute HIV-1 Infections\n\n【42】The acute HIV-1 infection may occur asymptomatic in a percentage of cases that is variable per different population, ranging from 8% to 77% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Especially in specific subgroups, this percentage shows great variation. The most important subgroups considered are men having sex with men (MSM), pregnant women, intravenous drug users, transgender individuals, and sex workers. The prevalence also shows a great variation across different parts of the globe 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 – 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【43】The typical symptomatic presentation may consist of one or more symptoms: fever, myalgia, general weakness, lymph node enlargement, pharyngitis , fatigue, anorexia, weight loss, oral ulcer, diarrhea, and a great variety of other symptoms; see Table 44.1 . The diagnosis of ARS is made by the presence of three or more of the symptoms and/or signs, together with a true-positive HIV-1 test result. While the symptoms and signs themselves are not typical for HIV-1 and especially mononucleosis infectiosa may also present with lymph node enlargement, the presence of risk factors should be assessed thoroughly, since these provide additional information directing the clinical picture presented.\nTable 44.1 删除换行 A comparison of the most frequent signs and symptoms in individuals with acute HIV infection\n\n| Sign/symptom  | No acute r etroviral syndrome ( n \\= 95)  | Acute retroviral s yndrome ( n \\= 335)  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Fever  | ++  | +++  |\n| Fatigue  | +  | +++  |\n| Pharyngitis  | +  | +++  |\n| Headache  | +  | +++  |\n| Myalgia  | +  | +++  |\n| Anorexia  | +  | +++  |\n| Weight loss  | +  | +++  |\n| Diarrhea  | ++  | +++  |\n| Skin rash  | +  | +++  |\n| Arthralgia  | +  | +  |\n\n【45】Legend (range)\n\n【46】\\+ 1–9 删除换行1: ++ 10–99 删除换行1: +++ 100+\n\n【47】Source: https://​www.​ncbi.​nlm.​nih.​gov/​pmc/​articles/​PMC5930255/​\n\n【48】For acute infections, a fourth-generation HIV test is required. Also, the confirmation test must be a fourth-generation HIV-1 test. Thus, the patient in the case report displayed most of the symptoms and signs that point in the direction of ARS , while his risky behavior pushes the differential diagnosis into the direction of ARS until proven otherwise. Special attention is drawn to the fact that the specific reason the patient sought medical attention came from his sexual behavior, which he himself considered as risky, with high probability of having led to an acute HIV-1 infection. So, actually there was no patient’s delay.\n\n【49】The natural history of the HIV infection is characterized by the acute retroviral syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The most frequent symptomatology of acute HIV-1 infections is shown in the following table.\n\n【50】### The Importance of the Presence of ARS in the Progression of HIV-1 Infection and Patient Prognosis\n\n【51】Not all patients with an acute HIV-1 infection present with ARS . Colby and coworkers estimated 78% of patients (335 out of 430; 97% were men) that tested positive during voluntary HIV screening at the Thai Red Cross AIDS Research Centre in Bangkok 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. However, once the ARS is diagnosed as the presenting form of acute HIV-1 infection , CD4+ cell depletion, a high CD4+ viral burden, and multiple body compartment immune activation were observed. Presence of ARS also predisposed to increased morbidity when inflammation persisted despite antiretroviral therapy (ART).\n\n【52】The importance of the early diagnosis from the individual patient perspective is the relationship between ARS , associated HIV RNA viral loads, and associated accelerated progression of HIV and worse prognosis. From the individual patient perspective, the most important aim is to give the patient, once diagnosed as having HIV-1, the best therapy available, with the best timing, in order to obtain the best treatment results. Antiretroviral therapy should be started as soon as the HIV-1 infection is confirmed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 7 , 9 , 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【53】### Early ARS Diagnosis from Public Health and Epidemiological Perspective\n\n【54】An early diagnosis of ARS is fundamental in epidemiological and public health perspective for limiting the transmission of HIV-1 to other persons, since it permits an early administration of ART in HIV-1 patients. Cohen and coworkers performed a clinical trial, comparing the early administration of antiretroviral therapy in early versus delayed ARS , and reported a 93% reduction of HIV-1 transmission in partners of the patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The corresponding hazard ratio for early treatment versus delayed treatment was 0.07 (95% confidence interval 0.02–0.022), and the study was done with 1763 patients, divided in 886 receiving therapy at a CD4+ count of 350 to 550 cells per cubic millimeter, and 877 patients starting therapy at a CD4+ cell count below 250 cells per cubic millimeter. These clinical trial results are in accordance with previous observations of Le and coworkers in a prospective cohort study, involving 384 participants receiving late ART and 213 participants who had received early ART 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. They concluded that initiation of ART during the 4-month period after HIV-1 infection was associated with an increased recovery of CD4+ cell counts. However, where Le and coworkers did not demonstrate the clinical benefit according to Walker and Hirsch 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>, Cohen and coworkers showed the benefit, especially the public health importance and the importance of partners involved 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【55】### The Importance of HIV Test Generation and Detection of HIV Infection\n\n【56】In order to avoid misdiagnosis of HIV- 1 , it is fundamental to take into consideration the different stages of the HIV-1 infection. In the CDC guidelines for HIV-1 testing of 2014, updated in 2018, Branson and coworkers analyzed and summarized the different testing availability and expected results, based on the classification according to different laboratory stages of HIV-1 infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.

The symptomatic presentation in the first months after the infection may often be mistaken for other diseases, especially mononucleosis infectiosa ( Morbus. Pfeiffer ), viral or bacterial pharyngitis . COVID-19 may be also considered due to the present pandemic; however possible co-infection is a real possibility. Although the presentation may be very similar, the treatments differ widely. Also, the prognosis is totally different. Therefore, a correct diagnosis is of pivotal importance. Furthermore, any delay in getting the correct diagnosis may affect the short-term and long-term prognosis for the patient. The delay may be prevented or even come to exist if the clues in the initial assessment of the patient are overlooked. Especially thorough medical history taking may point in the correct direction, since risk factors directing the differential diagnosis are most prominent in the medical history, especially the personal behavior of the patient. However, even when the correct direction toward the correct diagnosis is taken, using the appropriate statistical considerations and properties of the diagnostic tools involved may make the difference between the ultimate correct diagnosis and a misdiagnosis. That is the case with the following case report. Although one case report is discussed, the misdiagnosis of HIV-1 as especially mononucleosis infectiosa or acute pharyngiti s is not rare. Furthermore, it illustrates that besides the personal consequences for the patient, also the public health consequences may be far reaching if the probability of a misdiagnosis is partially based on a testing tool that is widely used although inappropriate for the acute phase of the disease.\n\n【25】Clinical Case Presentation\n--------------------------\n\n【26】This case report concerns the initial presentation of a 29-year-old man, initially diagnosed, by his general practitioner and also a second general practitioner he visited 1 day later, with pharyngitis , based on his presentation with sore throat, weakness, chills, a temperature of 38.5° C, and pain in the left arm and leg 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Despite prescribed antibiotics and paracetamol by the first general practitioner and confirmation by the second, the symptoms persisted. Because of fears emerging from his recent unprotected sexual activities, the patient sought HIV testing after 7 days, with a first fourth-generation test being reactive (positive), followed by four consecutive negative tests, all being third-generation HIV tests in, respectively, two primary care settings, one Public AIDS Counseling Center and one AIDS-NGO facility. Subsequently the patient underwent again a fifth HIV test, this time again using the fourth-generation test at the original laboratory of the first positive fourth-generation test result, and also this time the fourth-generation test was positive. However, confirmation by a third-generation Western blot test, in a reference laboratory, again was negative. Based on the long testing history and the history of the patient, a thorough physical examination and a fourth-generation further testing eventually led to the correct diagnosis of acute retroviral syndrome, undergoing seroconversion, with HIV-1 RNA viral load of more than 3,000,000 copies/mL.\n\n【27】Differential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【28】Given the medical history of the patient, the most probable differential diagnosis could be:\n\n【29】1.  1.\n\n【30】    Acute retroviral syndrome: The patient presentation with pharyngitis , chills, myalgia, and lymphadenopathy, together with a history of recent risky unprotected sexual behavior, is the typical presentation of the acute retroviral syndrome as consequence of an acute HIV infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In a study done by Crowell and coworkers in which they reported the signs and symptoms in patients with acute human immunodeficiency virus infection, 335 of 430 study participants had ARS . In the 335 ARS subjects, 93% presented with fever, 79% with fatigue, 67% with pharyngitis , 64% with headache, and 57% with myalgia, while 18% presented with adenopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】2.  2.\n\n【32】    Mononucleosis infectiosa: The presentation with adenopathy, and the other symptoms, raises a high suggestion of mononucleosis infectiosa , especially in young patients. However, given the history of multiple unprotected sexual contacts with males, this is to be considered in conjunction with acute HIV, which should be excluded. Furthermore, specific laboratory tests should manifest the presence of the typical mononuclear lymphocytes.\n\n【33】3.  3.\n\n【34】    COVID-19: The pandemic of COVID-19 causes a high prevalence of COVID-19 and therefore increases the probability that patients presenting with fever, chills, myalgia, and weakness may have COVID-19.

However, the overall picture of myalgia and general weakness and especially the rare presentation of isolated bacterial pharyngitis in adults should push the diagnosis and treatment of the pharyngitis to a “per exclusionem” category, i.e. after exclusion of other causes. Furthermore, in adults, pharyngitis seldom presents as an isolated illness but rather as a part of a wider spectrum of diseases or syndromes. Also, when assuming an isolated pharyngitis , treatment with antibiotics, if done, is to be preceded by a culture, in order to evaluate the choice.

Which of the following is most likely to be seen on physical examination in this case?\n删除个例：<u>> Reproduced, with permission, from USMLERx.com.</u>\n> (A) Galactorrhea\n\n【1】> (B) Hematochezia\n\n【2】> (C) Palpable gallbladder\n\n【3】> (D) Pearly papules on the face\n\n【4】> (E) Supraclavicular lymphadenopathy\n\n【5】 Answer: The correct answer is E. Krukenberg tumors are stomach cancer metastases to the ovaries that are described as mucin-secreting “signet-ring” cells. Stomach cancer is often adenocarcinoma that can spread aggressively to lymph nodes and the liver. A classic sign of metastatic stomach cancer is involvement of the left supraclavicular lymph node, called Virchow node. Involvement is on the left side because the thoracic duct drains all structures on the left in the thoracic cavity and all structures below the diaphragm on both sides.  \n\n【6】Answer A is incorrect. Galactorrhea is leakage from the breasts that is not associated with normal lactation but is associated with elevated prolactin levels secondary to prolactinomas in the anterior pituitary. Prolactin stimulates breast development and milk production while also inhibiting ovulation and spermatogenesis by inhibiting the release of GnRH and subsequently suppressing LH and FSH. Galactorrhea is not associated with stomach or ovarian cancers. Prolactinomas rarely metastasize.  \n\n【7】Answer B is incorrect. Hematochezia is bright red, bloody stool and is often an early sign of colorectal carcinoma. Risk factors for colorectal carcinoma include villous adenomas, inflammatory bowel disease, low-fiber diet, familial adenomatous polyposis, hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, and a positive family history. Hematochezia is not associated with stomach or ovarian cancers. Colorectal carcinomas usually metastasize to the liver.  \n\n【8】Answer C is incorrect. A palpable gallbladder (Courvoisier sign) is associated with pancreatic duct obstruction secondary to pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Other signs and symptoms of pancreatic cancer include abdominal pain radiating to the subscapular area, weight loss, anorexia, and migratory thrombophlebitis (Trousseau syndrome). A palpable gallbladder is not associated with stomach or ovarian cancers.  \n\n【9】Answer D is incorrect. Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) often presents as “pearly papules” on sun-exposed areas, such as the face and arms. Papules are not associated with stomach or ovarian cancers.

She is nauseous and has vomited twice in the ED and several times at home over the preceding few hours. She has a “strange” odor to her breath. Her urine is dipstick + for glucose and ketones. You are called to the emergency room to evaluate her in preparation for appendectomy.\n\n【10】VS: HR 140/min, RR 38/min, BP 82/66 mmHg, T 38.2 °C.\n\n【11】Preoperative Evaluation\n-----------------------\n\n【12】Questions\n\n【13】1.  1.\n\n【14】    Is this patient’s intravascular volume depleted? How would you assess her volume status? What factors would you address in correcting her volume status preoperatively? Which intravenous fluid would you choose?\n\n【15】2.  2.\n\n【16】    What metabolic studies are important to evaluate preoperatively? How will this influence your preparation for surgery? Should the case be delayed? If so, why? How long? Is this problem likely to resolve with improvement of her metabolic status? What organ system consequences are there of uncontrolled diabetic ketoacidosis in the acute phase and chronically?\n\n【17】Answers\n\n【18】1.  1.\n\n【19】    It is very likely that this child has a depleted intravascular volume. Her heart rate is elevated more so than would be due to a low-grade fever. In addition, with fever, insensible losses increase and she has been vomiting. Her blood pressure is low but within normal limits for an 8-year-old girl. Since blood pressure is preserved in hypovolemic children until compensation fails, a “normal” measurement is not reassuring. Dehydration is generally classified according to percentage decrease in body weight. A child who is 3% dehydrated has a 30 mL/kg deficit and clinically has an increased HR, dry mucous membranes, and concentrated urine. A child with 6% dehydration has a fluid deficit of 60 mL/kg and a significantly increased HR, very dry mucous membranes, and oliguria. In a child with 9% dehydration, the fluid deficit is 90 mL/kg, the blood pressure is decreased, and there is poor capillary refill, Kussmaul breathing, and obtundation. Fluid replacement should be with isotonic solution such as normal saline or lactated Ringer’s and should be given relatively rapidly.\n\n【20】2.  2.\n\n【21】    Serum electrolytes (Na, K, Cl, HCO <sub>3 </sub> ) and, in addition, phosphorus and calcium, anion gap, glucose, and perhaps blood gases should be evaluated preoperatively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. If the child is in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), surgery should be delayed at least until intravascular volume has been replenished and control of her DKA is underway. It is entirely possible that her abdominal pain is due to DKA and not any surgical problem 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Conversely, acute appendicitis can be the insult that precipitates DKA in a child who has diabetes mellitus but has not yet come to medical attention. While a big part of the problem in DKA is dehydration, overly aggressive replenishment can lead, in some cases, to the development of cerebral edema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Cerebral edema has been documented in many patients during DKA, but most patients remain asymptomatic. Fluid administration should be kept to <4 L/m <sup>2 </sup> /day. In addition, insulin infusion should be tailored to keep the decrease in glucose concentration to 100–180 mg/dL. During therapy for DKA, frequent measurement of serum osmolality is important in preventing a worsening of the cerebral edema.\n\n【22】Intraoperative Course\n---------------------\n\n【23】Questions\n\n【24】1.  1.\n\n【25】    What are your monitoring considerations? Does this patient need an arterial line? Should the patient have a central venous catheter? A urinary catheter? How would these monitors help your management? Are there any confounding issues?\n\n【26】2.  2.\n\n【27】    What agent would you choose to induce general anesthesia? What effects of the various induction methods are particularly important for diabetic patients? For maintenance, which inhalation agent would you choose? Is there a place for a regional anesthetic in this case?\n\n【28】3.  3.\n\n【29】    Is succinylcholine safe to give to this patient? What if the pH is 7.25? What is the effect of ketoacidosis on pharmacokinetics of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers ? Would you administer bicarbonate?\n\n【30】4.  4.\n\n【31】    Intra-op ABG: pH = 7.22, PaO <sub>2 </sub> \\= 160 mmHg, PaCO <sub>2 </sub> \\= 34 mmHg, K = 5.5 mEq, Na = 127 mEq, Cl = 97 mEq, glucose = 990 mg/dL.\n\n【32】    How should this be managed? What implication does this have for your anesthetic choice and technique? Should this be more of a “stress-free” anesthetic? Can this be accomplished with an inhalation anesthetic, or would a narcotic anesthetic technique be preferable?\n\n【33】Answers\n\n【34】1.  1.\n\n【35】    Standard ASA monitors are indicated, and given the frequency with which serum glucose, electrolytes, and pH will be checked, there is a strong case for adding an arterial line as well. The line will also be very helpful in postoperative management. The case for a central venous catheter is not as strong. If two adequate peripheral IVs and a Foley catheter are in place, she can be managed without a CVP. Urine output will not be a good measure of preload since she will have an osmotic diuresis due to glycosuria. However, the quality of the arterial waveform as well as the improvement of her metabolic acidosis is indicative of the adequacy of her intravascular volume. If there is a question of access or she remains unstable despite what is thought to be adequate fluid replacement, a CVP catheter should be placed after the induction of anesthesia.\n\n【36】2.  2.\n\n【37】    The induction of anesthesia should proceed with the assumption that she is not fully fluid resuscitated. This patient should have an intravenous induction. Given her nausea and vomiting, she should have full-stomach precautions. Any IV agent can be used if dosed appropriately. Propofol will lead to hypotension if given in the usual doses to a hypovolemic patient. Etomidate will suppress the adrenal cortex in this child with new-onset diabetes mellitus, DKA, and possible appendicitis. The choice of muscle relaxant to facilitate intubation presents difficulties. A nondepolarizing relaxant will take longer to provide intubating conditions in this child who would do better without mask ventilation, while succinylcholine will cause an increase in the serum potassium in a patient who may already have an acidosis-related elevation of serum potassium; it is important to check electrolytes preoperatively.\n\n【38】3.  3.\n\n【39】    Succinylcholine can be used but there may be problems. In patients with metabolic acidosis, hypovolemia, and/or hemorrhage, the administration of succinylcholine causes a greater increase in serum potassium that it does in healthy patients. If succinylcholine is used and hyperkalemic arrhythmias occur, treatment with hyperventilation, calcium chloride, and bicarbonate should be started immediately. Nondepolarizing relaxants are also affected by the presence of metabolic acidosis. Metabolic acidosis may augment the neuromuscular blockade from a nondepolarizing relaxant. The antagonism of blockade is not impaired by metabolic acidosis as it is by respiratory acidosis; however, bicarbonate administration should be reserved for severe acidosis (pH <7.2). There are several possible adverse outcomes from bicarbonate administration. Alkalosis will increase potassium entry into cells; bicarbonate may worsen the CNS acidosis. HCO <sub>3 </sub> <sup>− </sup> combines with H <sup>+ </sup> to form H <sub>2 </sub> O and CO <sub>2 </sub> and CO <sub>2 </sub> diffuses rapidly into the CNS while HCO <sup>− </sup> does not.\n\n【40】4.  4.\n\n【41】    The ABG shows a metabolic acidosis and partial correction with a respiratory alkalosis. The serum glucose is markedly elevated, at 990 mg/dL. The patient’s DKA is not being treated effectively at all. Therapy should include further fluid resuscitation and an additional regular insulin dose of 0.5 U/kg while the insulin infusion continues. The patient has hyponatremia and at the same time hyperosmolality. Serum osmolality can be calculated from the electrolytes as follows:\n\n【42】    $$$$ \\left(\\mathrm{Na}+\\mathrm{K}\\right)\\times 2+\\mathrm{glucose}/18+\\mathrm{BUN}/3 $$$$\n\n【43】    If we assume the contribution of BUN to osmolality is 10, then the equation reduces to\n\n【44】    $$$$ {\\mathrm{S}}{\\mathrm{osm}}=\\left(132.5\\cdot 2\\right)+\\mathrm{glucose}/18.\\left(132.5\\cdot 2\\right)+10+990/18=330 $$$$\n\n【45】    The hyponatremia may only be apparent, not real, if the water content of the plasma is reduced by the presence of excess lipids.\n\n【46】Postoperative Care\n------------------\n\n【47】Questions\n\n【48】1.  1.\n\n【49】    Should this patient go to the ICU postoperatively? What are you particularly concerned about? How frequently should the patient be metabolically monitored postoperatively?\n\n【50】2.  2.\n\n【51】    You are called to the PACU for a urine output of 7 mL in the first 2 h postoperatively. How do you evaluate this? Is a fluid bolus indicated? If so, what type of IV fluid? Is placement of a CVP catheter indicated? Would a urine analysis help understand this situation?\n\n【52】3.  3.\n\n【53】    Should this patient’s pain relief be managed with an epidural or morphine PCA? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each?\n\n【54】Answers\n\n【55】1.  1.\n\n【56】    This patient will be better off in an ICU overnight so that she can have frequent monitoring of her metabolic condition. Even if she had not undergone surgery, her condition was serious enough to warrant an ICU admission. She has arrived with a very large fluid deficit and severe metabolic acidosis. She is at risk for cerebral edema during her resuscitation, and the initial signs of raised ICP might easily be missed if she were not in an ICU. This patient should have hourly determinations of serum glucose, potassium, sodium, pH, and HCO <sub>3 </sub> . Her urine output, urine ketones, and glucose also should be monitored very often.\n\n【57】2.  2.\n\n【58】    Depletion of intravascular volume is a major part of the pathophysiology of DKA. The low urine output noted in the patient in the PACU can likely be attributed to that problem. Assessment of the degree of dehydration in the postoperative period is similar to what was done preoperatively, namely, history (anesthesia and ED records), physical exam (vital signs, skin turgor, and mental status), and laboratory (urinalysis, electrolytes, and glucose). An abnormal mental status can be due to one or more of several factors: hypo-/hyperglycemia, electrolyte disturbances, acidosis, raised ICP, residual anesthetic medications, and hypovolemia. Urinalysis is also complicated in this situation. Glycosuria will affect the specific gravity determination and will also cause an osmotic diuresis. A fluid bolus is indicated. There is now uncertainty about the role fluid IV rehydration in these children plays in the neurologic outcomes. Nevertheless, in the absence of hypovolemic shock, care should be taken with the speed of administration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. A CVP catheter would be a good guide to fluid administration and help minimize the risk of cerebral edema . Clinically, cerebral edema is not present when the child presents with DKA but develops during therapy for DKA, often as biochemical measures are actually improving.\n\n【59】3.  3.\n\n【60】    Pain management for this 8-year-old child following an appendectomy incision should be easily accomplished with IV opioids and IV PCA. Generally, these patients begin oral intake within 24 h of surgery and are easily switched to oral analgesics. Regional analgesia offers little additional benefit for the risks, albeit low, involved in placement of an epidural catheter. Provided she has not suffered any damage to her kidneys during her DKA episode, ketorolac can be added to her analgesic regimen.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:42:56", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:43:07", "cost": 10.734}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:03", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:43:07", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:42:56"}

He is started on UVB phototherapy. He presents for treatment sessions diligently 3 times per week. Initially, he does well and shows steady progress with decreasing scale, erythema, and induration of psoriatic plaques. However, after several months of progress, the improvement plateaus and the patient is left with resistant plaques on the extremities. After seeing no improvement for another 2 months, the patient asks you to increase the amount of light so he can be slightly sunburned. He states that the previous dermatologist that he did phototherapy with purposefully used high doses of light that would turn his skin pink. He also reports that mild erythema all over his body, for him, is mostly asymptomatic and leads to much better clinical improvement.\n\n【8】Discussion\n----------\n\n【9】According to the medical literature, it appears that for many patients, the optimal amount of light is near the minimal erythema dose (MED), which is the dose at which the skin turns slightly erythematous or pink 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 – 4 \\]</u>. Deliberately administering a dose of light consistent with the patient’s MED is called “erythemogenic” phototherapy. Erythemogenic phototherapy can be tricky because it can cause discomfort in some patients. In addition to the erythematous appearance of the skin, some patients also experience uncomfortable symptoms of burning, stinging, itching, or skin tightness. This can happen as soon as the MED is reached. Therefore, consistent treatment at the MED is not possible in all patients but only practical if the patient does not experience discomfort in terms of both appearance and symptoms.\n\n【10】For those patients who can tolerate induction of mild erythema (i.e. treatment at the MED), the erythemogenic phototherapy strategy is an option in order to maximize the speed of improvement and overall efficacy, although this may be controversial 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 – 3 \\]</u>. This strategy can also be used if the sub-erythemogenic dosimetry strategy leads to “stalemate” at a point of improvement that is less than satisfactory for the patient. Unfortunately, many patients cannot tolerate erythemogenic phototherapy. Furthermore, it may be preferable to have some margin of safety in patients who may be exposed to extra sunlight outside of the therapeutic setting. In such cases, “sub-erythemogenic” phototherapy, in which the dose of light is deliberately kept just below the MED, is the preferred strategy.\n\n【11】One situation in which erythemogenic phototherapy is almost always preferred is when using the excimer laser. The excimer laser dosimetry protocol calls for observation of mild erythema of the psoriasis plaque for the treatment response to be considered “good effect”, and the dose is kept stable once this is reached . In most cases, this optimal dose of excimer laser is actually a “supra-erythemogenic” dose, which is well beyond the MED of non-involved skin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】删除3：<u>Figure 6.1\n\n【13】“Erythemogenic” phototherapy (treating up to the dose at which the skin turns erythematous to pink) is the preferred method for treatment with the excimer laser</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:09:40", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:09:54", "cost": 13.454}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:03", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:09:54", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:09:40"}

As part of the routine preoperative evaluation, he had a complete blood count, but that was found to be abnormal. The procedure was cancelled and he is now referred to the internal medicine clinic for additional evaluation.\n\n【3】Aside from his prostate symptoms, the patient is asymptomatic. He has not experienced any recent fevers, chills, night sweats, arthralgias, or myalgias. His appetite is good and his weight has been stable. He is moderately physically active, plays golf regularly, and has not noted any fatigue or exertional dyspnea.\n\n【4】On examination, he is afebrile and normotensive. His conjunctivae are anicteric, and his skin and oral mucosa show no pallor. His chest is clear to auscultation, and his heart is regular without any murmurs. On abdominal examination, his liver span seems normal, and there is no palpable spleen.

Other labs including electrolytes, creatinine, and transaminases are all within normal limits.\n\n【6】 What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【7】 What is the most appropriate next step?\n\n【8】### ANSWERS TO CASE 59:\n\n【9】#### Lymphocytosis/CLL\n\n【10】Summary: A 65-year-old man has been in generally good health, and is incidentally noted to have a marked lymphocytosis (50 000/μL) on a routine lab test. He has had no recent fevers or other symptoms of infection. He is asymptomatic, and his physical examination is normal, without any pallor, petechiae, peripheral adenopathy, or splenomegaly. He has an elevated lymphocyte count on his CBC, but the other cell lines are normal.\n\n【11】 Most likely diagnosis: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)\n\n【12】 Most appropriate next step: Flow cytometry of peripheral blood to demonstrate a monoclonal B-cell population, and confirm the diagnosis\n\n【13】#### ANALYSIS\n\n【14】##### Objectives\n\n【15】1\\. Be able to evaluate a patient with leukocytosis to distinguish between acute and chronic leukemias, and nonmalignant causes of leukocytosis.\n\n【16】2\\. Know the diagnostic criteria and staging system for CLL.\n\n【17】3\\. Be familiar with the complications of CLL.\n\n【18】##### Considerations\n\n【19】In a patient presenting with marked leukocytosis, the first consideration is to try to distinguish between malignant and nonmalignant (usually infectious) causes of the elevated white blood cell count. This man is afebrile without any symptoms of infection, so infectious causes are unlikely. Since he is essentially asymptomatic and does not have anemia or thrombocytopenia, acute leukemia is also unlikely. The next steps would be to confirm the diagnosis of CLL with peripheral blood flow cytometry to demonstrate that the lymphocytosis is due to monoclonal proliferation, and then to stage the disease, so he can be advised regarding treatment decisions.\n\n【20】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【21】#### Lymphocytosis\n\n【22】#### DEFINITIONS\n\n【23】CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIA (CLL): Increased number of circulating mature lymphocytes (usually >10 000/μL) that are monoclonal B cells expressing the CD5 antigen.\n\n【24】SMALL LYMPHOCYTIC LYMPHOMA (SLL): Malignancy of mature B-lymphocytes that are monoclonal in origin. Synonymous with CLL, considered the same disease at different stages. If the clinical presentation is lymphadenopathy without peripheral lymphocytosis (<5000/μL), it is termed SLL.\n\n【25】LEUKEMOID REACTION: Leukocytosis with neutrophilia, and WBC count >30 000-50 000/μL, with immature neutrophils (myelocytes, metamyelocytes, promyelocytes) that are not monoclonal.\n\n【26】#### CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【27】In patients who are found to have a significantly elevated WBC count, a common clinical problem is to differentiate a hematologic malignancy from a reactive leukocytosis as a response to infection or inflammation.\n\n【28】If the elevated WBCs are predominantly myeloid cells, the differential diagnosis is usually between a leukemoid reaction and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). In patients with a leukemoid reaction, the peripheral smear may show myelocytes, metamyelocytes, promyelocytes, and sometimes myeloblasts. Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) is elevated in leukemoid reaction , but is low in CML cells. Leukemoid reactions are not dangerous in and of themselves, but they typically represent a response to a significant underlying disease state.\n\n【29】Patients with CML typically present with elevated WBC count, with increased mature and immature granulocytes, basophilia, and may also have a mild normocytic anemia and elevated platelet count. Patients with significant anemia or thrombocytopenia should be evaluated for an alternative diagnosis. At diagnosis, many patients with CML are asymptomatic, or may have mild nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, or might report some abdominal discomfort or early satiety due to splenomegaly. If CML is suspected, the diagnostic test of choice is an assay for the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome t(9;22) , using either cytogenetics or fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH), or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the BCR-ABL fusion gene , which is a constitutively active tyrosine kinase. This dysregulation of tyrosine kinase activity is part of the pathogenesis of CML. Initial treatment of patients in the chronic stable phase is usually with the targeted agent imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that blocks BCR-ABL–mediated signal transduction, and induces apoptosis in cells expressing BCR-ABL.\n\n【30】In contrast to the asymptomatic or subacute presentation of patients with CML, patients with acute leukemia present with marked leukocytosis but with anemia and thrombocytopenia , or with pancytopenia . Symptoms may include weakness, easy fatigability and dyspnea due to anemia, infections of due to neutropenia, or bleeding symptoms such as gingival bleeding, epistaxis, or menorrhagia. Occasionally, patients present with an extramedullary tumor mass due to accumulation of blast cells. Patients with hyperleukocytosis (WBC >50 000-100 000/μL) may develop leukostasis, which is the symptomatic state caused by microvascular ischemia due to white cell plugs, typically produces respiratory or neurologic distress, and is a medical emergency. The diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) is established by bone marrow biopsy using morphologic, cytogenetic, and molecular analysis. Initial management is stabilization and supportive care for acutely ill patients, and treatment with induction chemotherapy to try to achieve complete remission (CR).\n\n【31】##### Lymphocytosis\n\n【32】The most common clinical scenario involving elevated WBC count is a patient presenting with lymphocytosis. To determine if a lymphocytosis is present, one must calculate the absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), which is equal to the product of the total white blood cell count (WBC) and the fraction of lymphocytes on the WBC differential: ALC = Total WBC (cells/μL) × % lymphocytes ÷ 100. Lymphocytosis is present if the ALC >4000/ μ L.\n\n【33】Causes of lymphocytosis are listed in Table 59–1 .\n删除4：<u>Table 59–1 • CAUSES OF LYMPHOCYTOSIS</u>\n\n【34】Lymphocytosis is most frequently found in viral infections and only rarely in bacterial infection except pertussis. Pertussis (whooping cough) is often associated with ALC of 20 000-30 000/μL. The lymphocytes are small and mature appearing on peripheral smear. Other infections that can cause lymphocytosis are toxoplasmosis, brucellosis, and sometimes syphilis. The most common viral infection associated with lymphocytosis is Epstein-Barr virus . The clinical syndrome of infectious mononucleosis caused by EBV or other viral infections that are listed is characterized by fever and lymphadenopathy, and may produce larger, reactive lymphocytes (atypical lymphocytosis) .\n\n【35】##### Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia\n\n【36】CLL/SLL is an indolent disorder characterized by the monoclonal proliferation of mature B-lymphocytes that express the CD5 antigen. It may present as either a leukemia or a lymphoma, depending on whether lymphocytosis or lymphadenopathy is the predominant finding. Patients with CLL or SLL are often asymptomatic, and present with incidental discovery of lymphocytosis or painless adenopathy, respectively. On the peripheral blood smear of patients with CLL, there is an increased number of small, well-differentiated lymphocytes, which are fragile and are often seen as broken or “smudge” cells. Diagnosis of CLL is confirmed by peripheral blood flow cytometry demonstrating a monoclonal B-cell population that shows aberrant expression of a T-cell antigen (CD5).\n\n【37】CLL is a generally indolent disease but prognosis is extremely variable, with survival times from initial diagnosis that range from 2 to 12 years. The prognosis depends on the stage of disease, and a commonly used staging system is the Rai system based upon the concept that there is a gradual and progressive increase in the body burden of leukemic lymphocytes, starting in the blood and bone marrow (lymphocytosis), progressively involving lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy), spleen and liver (organomegaly), with eventual compromise of bone marrow function (anemia and thrombocytopenia). Median survival time ranges from 12 years at stage 0, 6 to 8 years at stage I/II, and 2 years at stage III/IV .\n删除4：<u>Table 59–2 • RAI STAGING OF CLL</u>\n\n【38】Patients with CLL have an imbalance of lymphocyte subsets and may develop altered immune responses including autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) and autoimmune thrombocytopenia, as well as recurrent viral and bacterial infections. In a small percentage of cases, CLL may transform into an aggressive large cell lymphoma (Richter syndrome) characterized by constitutional symptoms (fever, night sweats), progressive lymphadenopathy, and often extranodal (eg, liver) involvement.\n\n【39】CLL is considered an incurable disease, and many patients do not require treatment initially. Treatment is usually indicated if the patient develops any of the following symptoms: pancytopenia, autoimmune hemolytic anemia or thrombocytopenia, symptomatic bulky adenopathy or splenomegaly, or Richter syndrome.\n\n【40】###", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 13:51:59", "endTime": "2024/09/14 13:52:47", "cost": 48.608}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:03", "update_time": "2024-09-13 21:52:47", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 21:51:59"}

She was hypoxemic in the emergency department with oxygen saturations of 84% on room air normalizing with 2 L nasal cannula O <sub>2 </sub> supplementation. Vital signs showed a pulse of 82, BP of 147/95, respiratory rate of 18, and a temperature of 98.6 °F. Physical exam was notable for normal first heart sound, loud P component of second heart sound and grade I/VI holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal boarder. No dullness to percussion of the lungs was appreciated. No pulmonary bruit was auscultated. Lower extremities showed bilateral pitting edema, without clubbing or cyanosis. An initial troponin was 0.01 μg/L. N-Terminal proBrain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) was 467 pg/mL. An electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed a normal sinus rhythm. A chest x-ray  was read as showing an enlarged left pulmonary artery with diffuse bronchovascular markings; in addition, there was right lung volume loss with a reduction in vascular markings.\n\n【23】删除3：<u>Figure 2.1\n\n【24】Frontal and lateral chest radiographs show asymmetrically enlarged left pulmonary artery, small right pulmonary artery; a hypovascular right lung with a relatively smaller right hemithorax</u>\n\n【25】Past medical history included left leg DVT and pulmonary embolism in 1987 with a placement of IVC filter and has been on anticoagulation with warfarin ever since. Her breathing never returned to baseline since. She has history of heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), anti-thrombin 3 deficiency, and hypertension.\n\n【26】Social history was notable for no alcohol, illicit drug use or tobacco use.\n\n【27】An initial echocardiogram revealed mild right atrial dilation, mild right ventricular dilation and dysfunction with mild tricuspid regurgitation and a pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) estimate of 32 mmHg. The left atrium was mildly dilated. The left ventricle was normal in size and systolic function. No pericardial effusion was present. Bubble contrast administration revealed no evidence of shunting. Serologies for connective tissue disease and human immunodeficiency virus were negative. Spirometry tests revealed a forced expiratory volume of 1.96 L (84% of predicted), forced vital capacity of 2.37 L (76% of predicted), with a ratio of 80%.

Considerable “back-bleeding” in the right pulmonary arteries was observed during cardiopulmonary bypass. This resulted in a significant improvement in pulmonary hemodynamics with the following postoperative values: CVP 7, PAp 40/16 (25 mean), a thermodilution CO 4.9 L/min, a cardiac index of 2.3 L/min/m <sup>2 </sup> .

There are multiple enlarged bronchial collaterals, seen best on the coronal view .\n\n【44】删除3：<u>Figure 2.7\n\n【45】Coronal view of CT angiography pictured in Fig. 2.3 . Very large bronchial collateral vessel going to right lung (arrow)</u>\n\n【46】Clinical Comments\n-----------------\n\n【47】The first observation relevant to this case is that there are a number of clinical entities that are more commonly associated with non-perfusion of an entire lung than occlusion of a main pulmonary with organized, chronic thrombus. Extrinsic compression of the pulmonary artery from a mediastinal or hilar mass (adenopathy or neoplasm) or intrinsic disease of the artery as seen in vasculitis (e.g. Takayasu’s vasculitis, see Chap. 17 ) or a tumor (e.g. angiosarcoma, see Chap. 12 ) are in the diagnostic differential. In an adult, rarely is this finding due to pulmonary artery agenesis, especially in the absence of ipsilateral airway or parenchymal lung disease. This serves as the basis for the recommendation that a patient displaying such significant compromise in lung perfusion requires computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the chest to assist the clinician in making the correct diagnosis.\n\n【48】For those patients with chronic thromboembolic obstruction, and who are candidates for thromboendarterectomy surgery, there are numerous challenges to confront. Experience has shown that approximately 30% of patients with complete occlusion of a main pulmonary artery will not reperfused that lung even with a complete endarterectomy of the clot. And in another third of patients, incomplete reperfusion can be expected. Which outcome a patient will experience following a thromboendarterectomy is difficult to predict, though an extended period of occlusion seems to decrease the chance of reperfusion. This is especially the case if there is accompanying lung volume loss and scarring. A poor outcome is obviously more problematic if a patient presents with pulmonary hypertension and right heart dysfunction making it imperative that reperfusion and pulmonary hemodynamic benefit are achieved with endarterectomy surgery.\n\n【49】In addition, the reasons for suboptimal re-perfusion are unclear. The development of a distal arteriopathy with extended proximal occlusion of a main pulmonary artery has been suggested as a potential mechanism for this outcome. “Competitive blood flow” from systemic collateral vessels has also been proposed. As seen in many CTEPH patients, and illustrated in this case presentation, obstruction of major pulmonary arteries promotes the compensatory development of an extensive collateral systemic circulation, which is important to maintain tissue viability. Whether this collateral circulation is an essential factor in the development of a distal arteriopathy or is responsible for the inhibition of pulmonary arterial blood flow after endarterectomy remain areas of ongoing research. In the presented case, what occurred was partial reperfusion of the right lung with recruitment of enough of the pulmonary vascular bed to result in significant pulmonary hemodynamic and symptomatic improvement. Whether or not this incomplete re-perfusion relates to the extensive collateral systemic blood flow is not known. However, as has been the case in similar patients, subsequent improvement in perfusion of the endarterectomized lung tends to occur over time as long as anticoagulation is maintained.\n\n【50】Points of Emphasis\n------------------\n\n【51】Complete scintigraphic absence of perfusion to an entire lung requires cross sectional diagnostic imaging to ascertain the cause. For those patients with chronic thrombotic occlusion, pulmonary thromboendarterectomy can be an effective intervention to re-establish blood flow, though may be best performed early in the course of the disease.\n\n【52】Diagnoses\n---------\n\n【53】1.  1.\n\n【54】    Complete occlusion of a main pulmonary artery with chronic thromboembolus.\n\n【55】2.  2.\n\n【56】    WHO group IV pulmonary hypertension.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:39:21", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:39:45", "cost": 24.462}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:03", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:39:43", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:39:18"}

A prior biopsy was consistent with a lymphoproliferative disorder. She does not have a cough, has no difficulty lying flat, and is not short of breath. Her initial presentation several months earlier was with shortness of breath and a pericardial effusion requiring drainage (1200 mL).\n\n【9】On MRI, the mass is 8.8 (transverse) × 4.9 (anteroposterior) × 8.3 (longitudinal) cm. The mass is just behind the SVC, extending along the right paratracheal region, and is insinuated in the middle mediastinum, anterior to the carina. There is displacement of the main pulmonary artery leftward as well as downward displacement and compression of the right main pulmonary artery branch. The thoracic aorta is normal in caliber. There is compression of the right upper lobe airway and also compression of the left mainstem bronchus by the inferior component of the patient’s mediastinal mass . The central airway is patent.\n\n【10】To facilitate the biopsy, the surgeon requests one-lung ventilation.\n\n【11】Preoperative Evaluation\n-----------------------\n\n【12】Questions\n\n【13】1.  1.\n\n【14】    Given the findings, would you anticipate any comorbidities? Where is the middle mediastinum, and how does morbidity differ from patients with an anterior mediastinal mass?\n\n【15】2.  2.\n\n【16】    Are there any further tests you would want in preparation for the surgery? Would further imaging be useful? An echocardiogram? What about pulmonary function tests? What specifically would you look for – dynamic airway exam, static airway exam, or evidence of a diffusion problem?\n\n【17】3.  3.\n\n【18】    Do you have any specific considerations in preparing for one- lung ventilation for this case?\n\n【19】Answers\n\n【20】1.  1.\n\n【21】    The middle mediastinum is the central portion of the inferior mediastinum (the portion of the mediastinum caudal to the thoracic plane, drawn from the sternal angle to the intervertebral disc of T4–T5.) The middle mediastinum is bounded by the pericardial sac. While the clinical significance of the middle mediastinum with regard to tumors typically involves lymphadenopathy or metastatic lung disease, pediatric masses of the middle mediastinum typically include lymphoma or tuberculous nodes. These tumors can often affect contiguous structures by their mass effect. This is evidenced at the level of the carina and mainstem bifurcation in the CT scan slice as compression of both mainstem bronchi, with a greater effect on the left than the right.\n\n【22】    Anterior mediastinal masses, with regard to pathology, may also be lymphomas but can also be teratomas, thymomas or enlarged thymus glands, pericardial cysts, diaphragmatic hernias, or cystic hygromas. These may also have a mass effect on the trachea and heart and may, in addition, present with superior vena caval syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】2.  2.\n\n【24】    The location of the tumor and the CT scan evidence of bronchial compression should prompt a more complete investigation of the airway and cardiac implications. Pulmonary function testing would examine any component of dynamic airway obstruction as well as air-trapping leading to higher static lung volumes. Both of these findings, when abnormal, can be helpful in guiding mechanical ventilation, such as the use or avoidance of PEEP, alterations in the I:E ratio, or selection of tidal volumes based on compliance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Because of the location in the middle mediastinum, the heart should be evaluated for the tumor’s effect on the pulmonary circulation and impedance to the right ventricular outflow tract and the atria. The fact that the patient is basically asymptomatic is reassuring but not necessarily completely predictive when ventilation is controlled and the patient is anesthetized.\n\n【25】3.  3.\n\n【26】    One- lung ventilation is indicated to facilitate the thoracoscopic approach, and in a patient this size can be accomplished with a smaller double-lumen endobronchial tube. A double-lumen TT is labeled by the OD of the entire tube, with the measurement reported in French (Fr). Even though the OD is standardized, the ID of the double-lumen TT can vary between manufacturers. There is no need to memorize sizing tables, as one can obtain the ID of a lumen of any TT by simply looking on the package or in the package insert. In order for a well-lubricated bronchoscope to physically fit inside the lumen of the TT (and not seize up from friction), the OD of the bronchoscope (ODB) needs to be <90% of the ID of the TT (IDTT). This can be written as ODB/IDTT <0.9. Bronchoscopes can become deformed from repeated use and cleaning, and the tip may have a larger diameter than documented. It is always a good idea to test the fit of the bronchoscope inside a TT before use in the patient. During bronchoscopy , even if the CSA ratio is <50%, there will be an increase in airway resistance and a decrease in ventilation. So, the proper-sized bronchoscope and the proper-sized double-lumen tube need to be preselected. I would plan on a 32 French (French = outer diameter); tracheal tubes are usually cited as inner diameter, with the conversion of 3:1 French/mm. I would plan for a 32 French double-lumen tube. The lumen size of each tube varies with the manufacturer but is typically around 4.5 mm ID, so I would plan on using a 2.8 mm bronchoscope to guide the tube into the left mainstem bronchus.\n\n【27】Intraoperative Course\n---------------------\n\n【28】Questions\n\n【29】1.  1.\n\n【30】    What are your considerations for anesthetic induction ? Is it safe to go ahead with a routine intravenous induction of anesthesia? Why? Would you use neuromuscular blockade to facilitate tube placement? Would it be safer for the patient to breathe spontaneously? Under what circumstances is this a good idea?\n\n【31】2.  2.\n\n【32】    Would you place a single-lumen tube first before the double-lumen tube? How will you select the proper size for this patient? What method will you use to confirm proper placement of the tube? Does the surgeon’s choice of surgical approach influence the tube you will select? Why? What are the methods for confirming correct placement? Is ultrasound useful?\n\n【33】3.  3.\n\n【34】    Does this patient need an arterial line? Does it matter if the surgeon intends to do a formal lateral position thoracoscopic approach vs. a “bump up” at 300? How is this likely to affect gas exchange, oxygenation, and ventilation?\n\n【35】4.  4.\n\n【36】    What is your plan for postoperative analgesia ? Would a regional anesthetic be indicated? The surgeon tells you he doesn’t want the patient to have a Foley catheter postop. Does this influence your choice of regional technique?\n\n【37】5.  5.\n\n【38】    With lateral positioning and insufflation , the patient’s SpO2 decreases to 85% on 100% oxygen. What do you think is going on? What is likely to make it better? Will it improve if you just “wait it out”?\n\n【39】Answers\n\n【40】1.  1.\n\n【41】    It is reassuring that the patient is asymptomatic while awake with regard to respiratory distress. This won’t necessarily be true with apnea, positive pressure ventilation, and a general anesthetic. The CT scan suggests that air-trapping may occur because of extrinsic collapse of the airways at the level of the mainstem bronchi. Preservation of spontaneous breathing, which can be accomplished with incremental doses of propofol and a volatile anesthetic until the patient is completely anesthetized, and then cautious conversion to controlled ventilation in the absence of neuromuscular blockade would be a worthwhile exercise. If tolerated without air-trapping, then neuromuscular blockade can be introduced, cautiously. Relying on spontaneous breathing will not work after the introduction of a pneumothorax for the thoracoscopy.\n\n【42】2.  2.\n\n【43】    This is certainly an acceptable technique if a difficult airway is anticipated or impaired gas exchange is encountered, but in most circumstances, mask ventilation can be followed by placing the double-lumen tube directly. The proper size in this age group would be about a 32 French; as an outside diameter, this would be 10.7 mm (normal tracheal diameter about 13 mm) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. While there are different ways to confirm tube placement, it is most reasonable to intubate over an appropriately sized fiber-optic bronchoscope selectively placed into the proper bronchus. Most clinicians tend to choose only left-sided endobronchial tubes because of the higher likelihood of occluding the right upper lobe bronchus when a right-sided tube is chosen. For this case, it would depend on whether a left-sided tube can be advanced in the left mainstem bronchus, given the extrinsic compression. A carefully placed right-sided tube may need to be chosen because of the extrinsic compression to the left mainstem bronchus. The preformed endobronchial tube will not necessarily enter the left mainstem bronchus when placed blindly, but if blind placement is chosen, it can be confirmed by auscultation or chest X-ray. As clinicians use ultrasound with greater frequency, one can look for the loss and resumption of pleural sliding when the endobronchial lumen is occluded and then ventilated, respectively.\n\n【44】3.  3.\n\n【45】    Although not strictly required for this case, an arterial line is important for close monitoring of the hemodynamic consequences of the pneumothorax and insufflation on gas exchange and myocardial performance, especially when superimposed on any comorbidities resulting from the mass effect in the middle mediastinum. In addition, because of the vital structures in the area and the chance for any complications, closer monitoring can be accomplished with an arterial line. Numerous factors influence the efficiency of gas exchange during a VATS procedure, especially in a lateral decubitus position – the acute change in hydrostatic pressure gradient, the influence of abdominal viscera on diaphragmatic length and excursion, the influence of the anesthetic technique on hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, compression of the dependent lung parenchyma, the shift in the mediastinum and its influence on blood return and the cardiac output, etc. Older children and adolescents behave much like adults with regard to V/Q matching during one-lung ventilation; a period of V/Q mismatch is typically followed by progressive adjustment particularly when lower levels of volatile agents are utilized because of less depression of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. Infants and small children do not typically fare as well, and OLV frequently cannot be accomplished in this age group, resulting in the surgeon’s need to manually compress the lung for exposure or to tolerate periodic reinflation maneuvers during the procedure.\n\n【46】4.  4.\n\n【47】    With a VATS approach , analgesia may be accomplished by opioids, primarily. Adjunctive regional techniques would include intercostal nerve blocks performed by the surgeon under direct vision through the thoracoscope, the anesthesia team percutaneously, a paravertebral block, or a thoracic epidural. While a thoracic epidural can be limited to segmental blockade and have a higher likelihood of preserving bladder detrusor function, it is reasonable, when concerned about avoiding a Foley catheter, to use a paravertebral approach instead.\n\n【48】5.  5.\n\n【49】    This is not surprising when getting started and with the initiation of OLV . The strategy for avoiding hypoxemia is to maximize pulmonary vascular resistance on the operative side and minimize PVR in the dependent lung. Defense of the FRC in the ventilated lung will enhance normal pulmonary vascular resistance and will counter the paralysis, lateral positioning, the open or insufflated contralateral hemithorax, and the weight of the mediastinal structures. The paO2 and SpO2 may continue to fall/readjust for 45 minutes after OLV is started 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. CPAP for the dependent or operative lung can also be tried when intraoperative hypoxemia is encountered, although the surgeon’s view may be more difficult. Multiple strategies in varying combinations may need to be tried in order to achieve an optimal shunt fraction.\n\n【50】Postoperative Course\n--------------------\n\n【51】Questions\n\n【52】1.  1.\n\n【53】    The patient is complaining of pain in the PACU , rating it 8/10. How is this possible if the paravertebral block was sited correctly? Is there anything you can offer to provide additional pain relief, other than a systemic opioid?\n\n【54】2.  2.\n\n【55】    You note bubbling within one of the chambers of the Pleur-Evac three-chambered chest tube drainage system . Why are there three chambers? What do they represent? What is the significance of the bubbling? What does it represent anatomically? What can you do to fix it?\n\n【56】Answers\n\n【57】1.  1.\n\n【58】    A paravertebral block will not necessarily provide complete analgesia, particularly in the immediate perioperative period although the overall success rate is comparable to thoracic epidural analgesia. The incidence of hypotension, urinary retention, itching, nausea, and vomiting (7–17%) is lower than with intravenous analgesia or thoracic epidural analgesia. Other adverse events which are different from those for epidural analgesia include pneumothorax, pleural puncture, and vascular puncture, most of which are moot for thoracic surgery. The use of ultrasound guidance has substantially reduced these risks.\n\n【59】2.  2.\n\n【60】    The three chambers have three different purposes – a collection chamber, a water-seal chamber, and a suction control chamber. The collection chamber drains fluid, blood, or air. The water seal chamber holds a column of water (e.g. 2 cm) which prevents air from being sucked into the pleural space with inspiration, and the suction chamber may use a water column or controlled suction to generate up to −25 cm H2O for the water column or −40 cm H2O for suction. The presence of bubbling indicates an air leak, which may be accentuated by the patient coughing. In addition to a pleural tear, bubbling may indicate a migrated tube with drainage holes outside the skin or an inadequate closure of the chest tube insertion site 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 13:43:25", "endTime": "2024/09/14 13:43:43", "cost": 17.786}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:03", "update_time": "2024-09-13 21:43:43", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 21:43:25"}

Infection with Listeria is more common in the summer months. Disease is often the result of ingestion of the organism from infected foods such as milk, soft cheese, undercooked meat, or unwashed vegetables. L. monocytogenes causes asymptomatic or mild gastrointestinal infections in persons with intact immune systems and severe disease, most commonly meningitis, in those with impaired cellular immunity, such as pregnant women, neonates, patients with AIDS, and posttransplant patients on immunosuppressive medications. Two types of neonatal disease have been described. Early-onset disease, which occurs with in the first 2 days of life, is the result of transplacental infection. Initial signs and symptoms include difficulty breathing and pneumonia. This infection is also called granulomatosis infantiseptica, because severe disease can be associated with a granulomatous rash with abscesses. Late-onset disease, which usually occurs 2 to 3 weeks after birth, is thought to result from exposure to Listeria either during or shortly after delivery. This infection most commonly presents as meningitis. Clinically, these syndromes can be difficult to distinguish from that seen with group B streptococci.\n\n【12】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【13】#### Suspected Listeria Monocytogenes\n\n【14】### OBJECTIVES\n\n【15】1\\. Know the structure and physiology of L. monocytogenes .\n\n【16】2\\. Know the life cycle, virulence factors, and diseases associated with L. monocytogenes .\n\n【17】### DEFINITIONS\n\n【18】COLD ENRICHMENT: Used to enhance growth of Listeria , particularly from food\n\n【19】GRANULOMATOSIS INFANTISEPTICA: Severe form of Listeria infection of neonates in which granulomatous skin lesions are evident\n\n【20】ANTERIOR FONTANELLE: An opening of the neonatal skull between the sutures\n\n【21】GRAVIDA: Number of total pregnancies\n\n【22】PARA: Number of deliveries (usually after 20-week gestation); a pregnancy that ends prior to 20-week gestation is an abortus. By convention, para is listed in order of term deliveries, preterm deliveries, spontaneous or inducted abortions, and total living children (TPAL)\n\n【23】### DISCUSSION\n\n【24】Characteristics of Listeria\n\n【25】L. monocytogenes is a small, facultative anaerobic, gram-positive bacillus . It may appear as coccobacilli in pairs or chains, so it can be mistaken for Streptococcus pneumoniae or Enterococcus on Gram stain. L. monocytogenes is an intracellular pathogen, which allows it to avoid antibody-mediated defenses of the host. It initially enters host cells via the action of a protein, internalin, which induces phagocytosis of the bacteria. Listeria produces a toxin, which then lyses the phagosome, releasing the bacteria into the cytoplasm of the host cell. It replicates in the host cytoplasm and moves to the host membrane. By pushing against the membrane, a protrusion, known as a filopod, is produced, which can be phagocytized by adjacent cells.\n\n【26】This cycle is then repeated in the new host cell, allowing Listeria to spread without being exposed to antibodies or other humoral immunity factors. For this reason, host cellular immunity factors protect against infection, and those with impaired cellular immunity are vulnerable.\n\n【27】### DIAGNOSIS\n\n【28】Clinical diagnosis is difficult based on the nonspecific signs and symptoms. Clinically, L. meningitis in neonates resembles group B streptococci; both are a significant cause of bacterial meningitis in that age group. Definitive diagnosis of Listeria is made by culture of the CSF, blood, or both. Gram stain of the CSF would demonstrate small gram-positive bacilli, appearing similar to corynebacteria or S. pneumoniae .\n\n【29】Listeria will grow on routine agar media within 24 to 48 hours. On blood agar media Listeria demonstrate β-hemolysis, which differentiates it from Corynebacterium but adds to the difficulty in distinguishing them from streptococci. Specific identification is made in part by observation of characteristic tumbling motility on a wet preparation after room temperature incubation. A reaction of catalase positive helps to distinguish Listeria from streptococci.\n\n【30】Culture of Listeria from food may require cold enrichment, which would enhance the growth of Listeria . Food samples would be sent to a public health laboratory where some of the food would be enriched in a selective broth media at room temperature or lower.\n\n【31】### TREATMENT AND PREVENTION\n\n【32】Treatment of Listeria septicemia or meningitis is ampicillin plus or minus gentamicin. Of significance is the inherent resistance of Listeria to cephalosporins, which are commonly chosen as empiric therapy for meningitis in adults and would be appropriate for treatment of streptococcal meningitis in children. Prevention involves the avoidance of the consumption of under-cooked foods, especially in patients at high risk.\n\n【33】###", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:05:55", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:06:11", "cost": 15.971}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:02", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:06:11", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:05:54"}

Administration of glucagon following a carbohydrate meal elicited a normal rise in blood glucose, but glucose levels did not rise when glucagon was administered following an overnight fast. Liver biopsy revealed an increase in the glycogen content (6% of wet weight).\n\n【2】20.1 In which of the following enzymes is a genetic deficiency most likely for this patient?\n\n【3】A. Branching enzyme\n\n【4】B. Debranching enzyme\n\n【5】C. Glucose-6-phosphatase\n\n【6】D. Glycogen synthase\n\n【7】E. Muscle phosphorylase\n\n【8】20.2 To prevent the frequent episodes of hypoglycemia, which of the following dietary supplements would be most appropriate for this patient?\n\n【9】A. Casein (milk protein)\n\n【10】B. Fish oil\n\n【11】C. Fructose\n\n【12】D. Lactose\n\n【13】E. Uncooked cornstarch\n\n【14】Answer: \n20.1 B . Definitive diagnosis would await analysis of the glycogen structure and enzyme activities, but the hepatomegaly, increased liver glycogen content, fasting hypoglycemia, and muscle weakness are consistent with Cori disease type 3 glycogen storage disease. The increase in glycogen content results from an inability to degrade glycogen beyond the limit dextrin of phosphorylase. A deficiency in the debranching enzyme leaves glycogen with short outer branches.\n\n【15】20.2 E . Because fasting hypoglycemia results from an inability to break down glycogen past the limit dextrin of phosphorylase, a patient with type 3 glycogen storage disease should be given frequent meals high in carbohydrates. Uncooked cornstarch is an effective supplement because it is slowly digested, and therefore the glucose is released slowly into the bloodstream, helping to maintain blood glucose concentrations.\n\n【16】Question: 20.3 A 17-year-old boy presents complaining of an inability to perform strenuous exercise without bringing on painful muscle cramps and weakness. He indicated that mild to moderate exercise resulted in no problems. When he was administered an ischemic exercise test, his serum lactate concentrations did not significantly increase. A deficiency in which of the following enzymes is most likely the cause of the patient’s muscle cramps?\n\n【17】A. Carnitine palmityl transferase II\n\n【18】B. Glucose-6-phosphatase\n\n【19】C. Glycogen phosphorylase\n\n【20】D. Glycogen synthase\n\n【21】E. Very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase\n\n【22】Answer: 20.3 C . Although a deficiency in a number of enzymes can result in exercise intolerance, the lack of an increase in serum lactate following ischemic exercise points to an inability to a defect in the breakdown of glycogen in the muscle. The muscle depends on glycogenolysis for intense exercise, and fatigue rapidly ensues when glycogen is depleted. Patients with a deficiency in the muscle isoform of glycogen phosphorylase (McArdle disease) can tolerate mild to moderate exercise, but get muscle cramps with strenuous exercise as a consequence of the lack of glycogenolysis in the muscle cell.\n\n【23】Question: 20.4 A 23-year-old man has been vigorously working on the yard and begins to feel slightly light-headed from hypoglycemia. He drinks a can of soda and is aware of the competition for the glucose to be stored in his liver as glycogen versus used as energy in his muscles. What is the best explanation regarding the fate of the glucose in the soda?\n\n【24】A. The lower Km of hexokinase compared with the Km of glucokinase will tilt the glucose toward glycolysis.\n\n【25】B. The bolus of glucose via the soda will lead to a higher glucose level, inducing storage of the glucose into glycogen in the liver.\n\n【26】C. The muscle is using high levels of glucose, leading to an increased level of glucose 6-phosphate thus inhibiting glucokinase.\n\n【27】D. The glucose will be equally used by muscle for metabolism and liver for glycogen storage.\nAnswer: 20.4 A . Hexokinase is found in most tissues, and because of the very low Km (substrate concentration at which the enzyme achieves half maximal velocity) for glucose, it is designed to work maximally to provide ATP for tissue even at low levels of glucose. Hexokinase is inhibited by glucose 6-phosphate and is most active with low levels of glucose 6-phosphate. Glucokinase found in the liver has a high Km for glucose and is very active after a meal. The glucose in the soda would likely be used for ATP production.\n\n【28】BIOCHEMISTRY PEARLS\n\n【29】 The etiology of the syndrome is not clear, although recent reports have linked some cases of AFLP with a fetal inborn error in fatty acid metabolism.\n\n【30】 Following a meal, glycogen concentrations within the liver rise rapidly to high levels; this can be up to 10% of the wet weight of the liver.\n\n【31】 Liver insufficiency may be associated with hypoglycemia.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 10:58:57", "endTime": "2024/09/14 10:59:03", "cost": 5.372}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:02", "update_time": "2024-09-13 18:59:00", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 18:58:55"}

Norman\n\n【9】Email: SkinDrRob@aol.com</u>\n\n【10】Case Presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 22-year-old Hispanic woman presented to the office asking for evaluation of a rash on her face. The patient complained that the rash appeared on her nose and cheeks after brief sun exposure and lasted for nearly a week. She stated that this has occurred on multiple occasions within this past year. Physical exam revealed a superficial erythematous plaque on the nasal bridge and cheekbones. The patient admitted that she was not diligent about applying sunscreen on her face in the past. She is not on any medications, and her family history is remarkable for rheumatoid arthritis in her mother and lupus in her maternal grandmother.\n\n【12】Differential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【13】1.\n\n【14】Dermatomyositis\n\n【15】2.\n\n【16】Cutaneous lupus erythematosus\n\n【17】3.\n\n【18】Rosacea\n\n【19】4.\n\n【20】Seborrheic dermatitis\n\n【21】Diagnosis\n\n【22】Cutaneous lupus erythematosus\n\n【23】Discussion\n----------\n\n【24】Dermatomyositis is an inflammatory disease of the skin and skeletal muscles. Although the muscular inflammation can occur after the cutaneous manifestations in this disease, the patient did not present with the characteristic skin involvement of the hands and knuckles of dermatomyositis, making this diagnosis less likely. Rosacea often occurs after the age of 30 and often appears with papules and pustules. Although this patient’s lesion was located in an area common for rosacea, the diagnosis is less likely. Finally, seborrheic dermatitis can present as a red lesion over the malar region of the face; however, it may also present with dry, yellow scale at the inflamed base which this patient did not have.\n\n【25】### Overview\n\n【26】Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem connective tissue disease affecting the blood, joints, skin, and kidneys. It primarily affects women in their 20s and 30s with a higher incidence in blacks and Hispanics. The severity of this disease is highly variable and may present with exacerbations and remissions throughout a patient’s life. Common symptoms include fatigue, fever, and arthralgia, and approximately 50 % of patients present with cutaneous features including a butterfly rash, discoid lupus, and photosensitivity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 – 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【27】### Pathogenesis\n\n【28】The onset of SLE has been linked to genetics and the environment. Greater risk of developing SLE exists for patients whose family members have the disease. Environmental factors which exacerbate SLE or precipitate its onset include UV light exposure, infections, estrogen, medications, stress, surgery, and pregnancy. Such factors may lead to cell destruction and creation of antibodies against nuclear antigens. Further, an allele of STAT4, a transcription factor used in mediating responses to IL-12 in lymphocytes and in regulation of T helper cell differentiation, is associated with increased risk for SLE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 – 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】### Clinical Presentation\n\n【30】Cutaneous lupus erythematosus can more commonly present as a rash, telangiectasia, alopecia, utricaria, or Raynaud’s phenomenon.\n\n【31】Cutaneous lupus erythematosus rash can be subdivided into several subsets: discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) in 25 % of patients, subacute cutaneous LE (SCLE) in 10 % of patients, and acute cutaneous LE in 50 % of patients. Chronic discoid lesions can occur in up to 25 % of lupus patients, and patients with these lesions have a 5–10 % greater risk of developing systemic symptoms of lupus. These lesions appear well-formed red plaques which are covered with scale that infiltrates the hair follicles. These lesions most frequently occur on sun-exposed areas. SCLE lesions start out as small red papules with slight scaling that become either psoriasiform or ringed form. The acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus rash is the classic malar rash on the cheeks and nose which occurs normally after UV light exposure.\n\n【32】Telangiectasias occur in 53 % of lupus patients and present on the palms and fingers but spare the knuckles. Alopecia occurs in more than 20 % of lupus patients and can be scarring or nonscarring, with the latter being more common in lupus. Utricaria occurs between 7 and 28 % in lupus patients and my not be visually distinct from hives; however, the urticarial lesions in lupus are non-pruritic and stay in the same location as opposed to hives. Lastly, Raynaud’s phenomenon occurs in greater than 20 % of lupus patients and can appear before other signs of the disease by months to years.\n\n【33】In neonatal lupus erythematosis, infants develop red macules, patches, or plaques soon after birth which are worsened by UV light exposure. This syndrome is rare and is associated with maternal antibodies to Ro/SSA, La/SSB, or U1RNP and usually resolves within 6–8 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【34】### Laboratory Examinations and Diagnosis\n\n【35】Patients with cutaneous LE should have their lesion biopsied in order to define the type of cutaneous lesion. Additionally, patients can have a biopsy performed on their normal (lesion free) sun-exposed skin to have a Lupus band test performed. For patients with DLE, SCLE, or SLE, immunoglobulin deposits will be located at the dermoepidermal junction. Further, such patients should obtain blood studies to evaluate their disease progression over time. Patients with cutaneous manifestations of lupus should be evaluated for manifestations of SLE such as renal, hematologic, neurologic, or immunologic disorders because they have a higher risk of developing SLE. Such studies include: CBC, ESR, platelet count, ANA, anti-nDNA, anti-RNP, anti-Ro, anti-La, anti-Smith, serologic tests, and urinalysis. To be diagnosed with SLE, they would need to have 4 of the following 11 parameters: malar rash, discoid rash, photosensitivity, oral ulcers, arthritis, serositis, renal disorder, neurologic disorder, hematologic disorder, immunologic disorder, and ANA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【36】### Treatment\n\n【37】Preventative care for patients with cutaneous LE includes avoidance of direct exposure to sunlight and sunscreen with a value greater than 15 SPF. Topical corticosteroids are the first line agents for cutaneous LE. Patients may apply corticosteroids up to three times a day, limiting it to the affected area. DLE lesions may be resistant to topical steroids. Topical tacrolimus has been shown to be effective. Certain recalcitrant lesions may respond better to intralesional steroid injections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【38】When topical steroids fail, antimalarial agents are the drugs of choice to treat cutaneous LE. Patients can be maintained on a therapeutic dosage of hydroxychloroquine two times a day until their lesions resolve, after which they should be reduced to the lowest dosage and maintained to moderate flare-ups. An important concern which accompanies the use of antimalarial agents is ocular, specifically retinal, toxicity. Thus, patients should have periodic eye exams. Dapsone is an alternative to antimalarials to treat cutaneous LE.\n\n【39】When patients fail to respond to topical steroids, antimalarial agents, or dapsone, they may switch to oral corticosteroids. Patients are put on high dose prednisone until their disease is controlled and then slowly tapered and moved back to traditional therapy.\n\n【40】Other alternative drug therapies include azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide, and acitretin for resistant DLE; isoretinoin for DLE and SCLE; and mycophenolate mofetil for refractory dermatologic conditions of SLE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 4 , 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【41】### Integrative Approach\n\n【42】Patients with cutaneous LE may explore alternative treatments for their condition such as inclusion of herbs, dietary investigation and changes, and pulsed dye laser therapy.\n\n【43】Patients may include anti-inflammatory herbs in their diet to reduce their inflammation such as pine bark extract, grapeseed extract, turmeric, and reishi mushroom extract. They should avoid the herb Echinacea because it stimulates their immune system and would worsen their autoimmune disease.\n\n【44】Patients should strive to eat a low-calorie, low-fat diet, with less beef and dairy products and more vegetables, chicken, and especially fish. They should also drink eight glasses of water daily and research any food sensitivities which may be worsening their disease. Patients should avoid eating alfalfa, as this food stimulates the immune system with its compound l \\-canavanine, and plants in the nightshade family. Finally, patients should remove animal fats and oils high in omega-6 which also can increase inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【45】Patients with refractory chronic DLE can try pulsed dye laser therapy (PDL). In Erceg et al.’s study, 12 patients with DLE received PDL therapy 3 times with a 6 week interval and 6 week follow-up period. The study found that PDL treatment is beneficial and safe for this population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【46】Key Points\n\n【47】1.\n\n【48】Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem connective tissue disease affecting the blood, joints, skin, and kidneys.

In WPW， the presence of an abnormal band of myocytes creates an accessory conduction pathway， distinct from the AV node， between the atrial and ventricular systems Because the myocytes contain sodium channels， whereas the AV node has calcium channels， excitation often progresses faster through the accessory pathway than the AV node.\n\n【6】Why is the PR interval on ECG shortened in this condition?\n\n【7】The PR interval is the interval between atrial excitation (the P wave) and ventricular excitation (the QRS complex). Thus， it is analogous to the conduction time through the AV node. It is shortened in WPW syndrome because AV conduction occurs via a faster， accessory pathway (frequently， the bundle of Kent)， which bypasses the AV node.\n\n【8】What would be the consequence if this patient developed atrial fibrillation?\n\n【9】The consequences would be potentially lethal. Atrial fibrillation has an atrial rate of up to 300 excitations/ 删除换行1: min. In a normal heart， the AV node is still refractory when subsequent depolarizations arrive and maximally 删除换行1: allows a ventricular rate of approximately 150 depolarizations/min.

Murray’s mother, Alice, reported that he had always been a very “neat” child, although over the past 6 months he had begun insisting on lining each of his toys up along the wall in his room in a specific order, and he would become very angry and upset if his parents or older sister (9 years) would touch or move them. When this happened, Murray would scream loudly and snatch the toy back, then proceed to spend several minutes reorganizing his toys until he felt they were lined up “just right.” As a result, Murray’s parents tried to keep his sister out of his room, and Alice would only vacuum Murray’s room while he was at preschool so he did not witness her moving the toys. Murray also lined up the pencils and paints on the table at preschool and would yell “don’t” or “get” if another child attempted to take one. Over the past 6 months, Murray’s reactions had begun to escalate, and he had hit or pushed other children several times in recent months when they had attempted to take an item, leading to minor injuries and requiring the preschool teacher to intervene.\n\n【3】Although Murray had always been a fussy eater, his eating had become increasingly restrictive over the past year, refusing to eat “slimy” foods, and insisting that his foods did not touch on his plate. Murray would push his plate away or throw it on the ground when his mother or preschool teacher presented him with foods that he considered “wrong”, and he would begin to cry inconsolably. He had also been known to spit foods onto the table once they became slimy in his mouth after chewing them. As a result, Alice tried to only give Murray “crunchy” foods and would make him another meal if he refused his dinner, reporting concerns that he would be hungry or may lose weight if she did not provide acceptable foods for him.\n\n【4】Alice also reported that Murray had always been afraid of using public toilets, and he would refuse to enter the bathroom even with his mother accompanying him. Although he had been toilet trained from the time he was two, he often wet himself at preschool and while they were out shopping as a result of his refusal to enter public bathrooms. Murray would use the toilet at home, although refused to press the flush button. It appeared that Murray’s anxiety was related to the unexpected sounds in the bathroom from the automatic flush and electric hand dryer, and it did not appear to be contamination related. Alice also reported that Murray was fearful of the noise made by the vacuum cleaner and blender.\n\n【5】### Background\n\n【6】Murray had been conceived using in vitro fertilization (IVF) subsequent to Alice suffering two miscarriages after the pregnancy with his older sister. Alice described Murray as their “miracle baby.” Alice reported an unremarkable pregnancy and delivery, but described him as a “fussy baby” with early difficulties in feeding and sleeping. She noted that as a toddler, Murray was emotionally labile, and would have “meltdowns” in crowds of people, especially loud situations, and was inconsolable until Alice removed him from the situation. As a result, the family had chosen a small daycare center for him, and they tended to avoid crowded shops and playgrounds, preferring to go to a local park near their house to play. Alice and her husband, Clarence, took turns minding the children while the other parent attended to necessary household tasks, such as grocery shopping to avoid any meltdowns. Alice reported that she was concerned about how Murray would cope when he transitioned to primary school.\n\n【7】There was a strong family history of anxiety, with Murray’s father, Clarence, suffering social anxiety in his adolescence and early adulthood and Alice herself reporting being a “worrier.” Alice reported suspicions that her mother suffered from OCD and still had had a preoccupation with contamination, although this was not discussed openly in their family.\n\n【8】Alice reported that Murray had been under the care of a pediatrician from a young age due to his difficulties in feeding and sleeping. They had attended occupational therapy sessions for several months when he was 3 to help with his emotional outbursts with little efficacy. Murray’s speech was slightly delayed and simple in content for his age, although the family had not sought any speech therapy.\n\n【9】Murray had always been a shy child who took a while to warm up in new situations; however, he had made several friends at daycare. Over the past 6 months, Murray’s preschool teacher had noted that the other children no longer wanted to play with him as a result of his outbursts and refusal to share the toys that he had arranged in the playroom. While some of his friends would sometimes try and play with him at the start of the day, they often lost interest when Murray began engaging in his ordering rituals.\n\n【10】Assessment and Case Conceptualization\n-------------------------------------\n\n【11】Given Murray’s age, and the length of clinical interviews, Alice and Clarence attended the first session at the clinic without him and completed two semi-structured clinical interviews: the CYBOCS to assess for the full range of OCD symptoms and the ADIS to assess for comorbid disorders. Murray’s level of functioning was rated using the Children’s Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) and the Clinical Global Impression-Severity Scale (CGI-S). Based on the results of this assessment, it was determined that Murray had a primary diagnosis of OCD and comorbid specific phobia—other subtype (loud noises).\n\n【12】Murray’s OCD and specific phobia present in the context of significant family history of anxiety. The difficulties surrounding Murray’s conception and his early temperament have influenced a parental perception that Murray is “precious” and vulnerable, and, as a result, Alice and Clarence try to protect him from getting upset. In addition, Murray appears to have particular sensory sensitivities (auditory and tactile) that overlap with his fear-based symptoms. Given his high levels of distress, and the difficulties Alice and Clarence describe in terms of soothing him, there are high levels of family accommodation of his anxiety that are likely to be maintaining his symptoms. Additionally, there is accommodation of his symptoms at preschool where teachers try to redirect the children to play with different toys if there is an altercation with Murray, reinforcing his ritualized behavior. Murray’s symptoms are having an increasingly significant impact on his social functioning at preschool, family functioning and relationship with his sister who now complains that Murray gets preferential treatment in the family. Additionally, Murray will be starting school next year where his symptoms are likely to be more impairing, given the increased structure of activities, toileting issues, and new peer group.\n\n【13】Illustrative Treatment Course\n-----------------------------\n\n【14】Despite the rationale for involving both parents in treatment being provided, Clarence was unable to attend sessions regularly given his work schedule. Alice attended 11 treatment sessions with Murray, and Clarence attended 3 sessions intermittently through the treatment. The initial session aimed at providing psychoeducation about OCD and anxiety. Psychoeducation focused on providing information about adaptive and dysfunctional anxiety, typical presentations of OCD, the negative reinforcement of compulsive behaviors, and the role of accommodation and avoidance in maintaining anxiety. Murray’s emotional outbursts were explained in the context of common anxiety reactions in young children. Alice was able to understand and identify with the vicious cycle of anxiety, whereby allowing him to engage in his compulsions, and facilitating accommodation and avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations reduced his distress in the short term, but led to an overall escalation in his anxiety in the longer term. The efficacy of family-based CBT in the treatment of OCD and anxiety in young children was reviewed along with the treatment rationale, highlighting the importance of reducing accommodation, avoidance, and compulsive behaviors. Psychoeducation was provided in a developmentally sensitive way with Murray, focusing on externalizing his OCD, identifying how it makes him feel in his tummy, and what behavior it makes him engage in. Examples were provided to illustrate the link between feelings and behaviors, asking questions such as “sometimes OCD makes kids get mad with their mum or dad, or with their friends. Does OCD ever make you get mad?” Maladaptive responses to anxiety were discussed using the language of OCD being “bossy” and tricking kids into engaging in certain behaviors, even though nothing bad was going to happen. Murray engaged well with this, and when asked “is the OCD the boss of you, or are you the boss of the OCD?” he responses that OCD was the boss of him, but he would prefer to be the boss. Murray and Alice both laughed at the idea of tricking OCD and bossing OCD back, by not doing what it says. Murray suggested that he could tell OCD “no,” that it was “naughty” or that he was the “boss” to help reduce the intensity. While it was not anticipated that this would be particularly potent in maintaining Murray’s engagement in therapy or reducing his anxiety, this was the first time that Alice had experienced any level of motivation in Murray to resist his urges.\n\n【15】Session 2 focused on behavior management techniques and introduction to ERP. Murray and his parents had a warm and loving relationship, and he was generally a complaint child outside of his anxiety-related outbursts. However, given the severity of parental accommodation and difficulty tolerating his discomfort, some basic behavioral management principles were utilized in the next sessions with Alice, who was encouraged to review these with Clarence at home. Strategies focused mainly on selectively ignoring protests and whining while using differential reinforcement of alternative behaviors, including an introduction to the use of rewards to increase “brave” behaviors in preparation for exposure sessions.\n\n【16】Parenting skills were practiced in session with the therapist during a child-led play period, including unstructured play and play involving the need to complete a slightly challenging puzzle. This allowed the therapist to highlight the need for clear and focused communication with Murray, rather than lengthy bargaining or explanations to encourage behaviors, or providing excessive reassurance. The therapist provided coaching to Alice during the interaction rather than engaging directly with Murray. Alice engaged quickly with the use of labeled praise and reflective statements about appropriate play behaviors after noticing a change in Murray’s behavior and his ability to persevere with the puzzle despite some frustration.\n\n【17】Given that most of Murray’s inappropriate and aggressive behaviors occurred in the context of his compulsions being interrupted, basic behavior management strategies were conceptualized to be important in assisting Alice and Clarence to feel more confident in reducing their level of parental accommodation. Some basic emotion-coaching skills were addressed, where Alice was encouraged to label Murray’s feelings and experience and provide suggestions on more appropriate behaviors if necessary (e.g. “I can see that you are really angry that your sister moved your truck, because the OCD tells you they have to be in a special way on the wall. You can tell her that you want her to stay out of your room using your words, but we do not hit each other in our family”). Logical consequences were also reinforced, such as requiring Murray to clean up the mess if he spits food on the table. Practice using the parent management skills was set for homework both to demonstrate the skills for Clarence and to build Alice’s confidence. Murray enjoyed the play task, and was eager to play with his parents at home during the week, requesting that his sister was not allowed to join in.\n\n【18】The remainder of the second session focused on introducing ERP. Rationale for exposure was reviewed with Murray and Alice in the context of OCD “tricking” kids to get them to engage in certain behaviors, and that when kids engage in those behaviors, OCD gets stronger, while OCD gets weaker when they do not. In an effort to “boss back,” part of the sessions would involve doing things to annoy OCD, like not doing what it told him to do. Murray was uncertain initially, although was pleased to know that his mother and therapist would be helping him, and that they would start by practicing easy steps to help Murray “get stronger.” Murray and his mother generated an initial exposure hierarchy with the help of the therapist. Given that young children often fund the use of subjective units of distress (SUDs) ratings difficult to understand and use, steps were categorized into steps in terms of increasing difficulty using descriptors like “a little,” “medium,” or “big.” The hierarchy focused on the domain that Alice considered to be the most impairing currently, his ordering 删除25：<u></u>. Murray was able to rate which step would be more or less difficult when presented with two options and the order of steps was approximated with the assistance of Alice’s impressions. The importance of reducing family accommodation of Murray’s OCD was discussed with Alice, and it was incorporated throughout the exposure tasks with assistance from the therapist to reduce her participation in Murray’s rituals (e.g. delaying leaving from home to allow him to complete his ordering ritual, avoiding vacuuming while Murray was home, discussing/reassuring him that he had arranged his toys once they had left the house).\nTable 20.1 删除换行 Exposure hierarchy for ordering\n\n| Expected anxiety/difficulty | Step |\n| --- | --- |\n| Big/very hard to do |  |\n|  | Leave toys out “messy” overnight |\n|  | Choose one toy to play with. Do not move other toys |\n|  | Murray to put toys away in box |\n|  | Allow mum to move toys in different order |\n| Medium/hard to do |  |\n|  | Drop pencils on table and leave wherever they land—10 mins |\n|  | Murray to move two toys out of line—leave for 15 min |\n|  | Drop pencils on table and leave wherever they land—2 mins |\n| A little/a little bit hard to do |  |\n|  | Murray to move one toy out of line |\n|  | (Home/preschool practice only) Let another child take one pencil/paint |\n|  | Allow teacher/therapist take one pencil or paint out of line |\n\n【20】Exposure sessions initially started with therapist-led exposure to model the exposure procedure for Murray’s parents. The therapist would identify the step being targeted, and Murrays distress ratings (little, medium, or big). Young children are highly motivated by extrinsic rewards, and Murray selected a sheet of stickers that he found appealing and was instructed that he would receive one sticker for each step he completed to take home and show his father. Murray was very excited by this idea. During the initial session, Murray was reluctant to engage in exposure, and on the first two tasks, he snatched the pencil back from the therapist. The therapist reoriented Murray to the task, and Murray preselected the sticker that he would like to work towards. The step was attempted a second time, during which Murray was able to complete the task where he was praised by his mother and therapist, and received his sticker. Once Murray began to earn stickers, he became more engaged in the session. Alice stuck the hierarchy on the fridge and Murray was allowed to draw a red line through the step once he and Alice felt that he was confident with completing that step. Alice spoke with Murray’s preschool teacher about facilitating exposure tasks involving other children, and after completing this step once in the presence of his mother, the preschool teacher facilitated addition practice allowing other children to share the toys he was playing with.\n\n【21】After two sessions of therapist-led exposures, sessions focused on parent-led exposure with support, skill correction, and support from the therapist. In particular, Alice benefitted from setting limits around the amount of instruction and reassurance she would provide before completing an exposure task. Murray became resistant to progressing to the more challenging tasks, especially the final task of moving his toys into a box rather than lined up on the wall. Alice was prompted to break this task into several steps of increasing difficulty, such as putting only three toys in the box and subsequently increasing the number placed in the box, with the aim of building back up to the original target behavior. Play was also used during the steps to make that task more enjoyable for Murray, such as racing two toy cars with his mother to see which car could get into the box the fastest. Selective ignoring of Murray’s protests and persistence in completing the step was modeled in session if Murray hesitated to complete the step, as it became apparent that if Murray showed initial signs of distress, Alice was quick to intervene or reduce the difficulty of the tasks (e.g. Alice would suggest they try again later, or place the toy in the box herself). A token system was also employed whereby once Murray obtained ten stickers he was rewarded with a small Lego set. Prompting from his mother about the number of stickers he had obtained towards the Lego, along with the alterations in parenting strategies, was sufficient to motivate Murray to persist with these more challenging steps.\n\n【22】Once there was some progress in addressing the ordering behaviors (around session 6), two more hierarchies were sequentially developed to increase Murray’s ability to tolerate loud noises (including going inside and using public toilets) and then to progressively eat a greater variety foods (including soft foods) and allow his foods to touch or mix together.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:10:46", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:10:54", "cost": 8.841}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:02", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:10:55", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:10:46"}

There are two types of contact dermatitis: irritant and allergic. Irritant contact dermatitis occurs as a result of direct damage to the stratum corneum by chemicals or physical agents with an inflammatory nonimmunologic cutaneous reaction. The likelihood of developing irritant contact dermatitis depends on individuals susceptibility as well as the duration, intensity, and concentration of the substance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Prior sensitization is not required. The lesions may present after a single episode of exposure to a strong irritant or repeated exposure to weak irritants 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Women, infants, elderly, and individuals with atopic history are more commonly affected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Allergic contact dermatitis is a delayed type IV hypersensitivity reaction to external chemicals (allergens) that only occurs in susceptible individuals who have previously been sensitized. The sensitization phase of allergic dermatitis typically lasts 10–14 days. The re-exposure of the skin to the allergen after sensitization results in dermatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Risk factors for allergic contact dermatitis include age, occupation, and history of atopic dermatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Contact dermatitis is characterized by the presence of erythema, papules, scaling, vesiculation, and bullae during the acute phase as well as lichenification and fissuring in chronic disease. In most cases, the lesions are limited to the site of contact 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Itching, burning, stinging, or pain may be reported. The scalp is particularly resistant to contact dermatitis. An allergens applied to this area often produce dermatitis of the eyelids, ears and neck. Nevertheless, potent allergens may also cause severe reactions of the scalp. The most important allergens eliciting contact allergy of the scalp are found in bleaches and dyes, shampoos and conditioners, products for perm waves and straighteners as well as topical drugs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Diagnosis of contact dermatitis is mainly established clinically. Dermoscopy and histopathological examination are useful. Dermoscopy of contact dermatitis is characterized by dotted vessels distributed in clusters or randomly, yellow scales and serocrusts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Histopathology of contact irritant dermatitis presents with mild spongiosis, epidermal cell necrosis, and neutrophilic infiltration of the epidermis. In allergic contact dermatitis dermal inflammatory infiltrate predominately contains lymphocytes and other mononuclear cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Patch testing is the gold standard in diagnosing contact allergic dermatitis and is used to determine the exact cause. Identification and avoidance of the underlying cause is the most important in contact dermatitis treatment. Friction should be also avoided as well as the use of soaps, perfumes, and dyes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The regular use of emollients is recommended 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. High-potent and potent topical corticosteroids are usually the first-line therapeutic option. Topical tacrolimus ointment and pimecrolimus may be also helpful. Antihistamines such as hydroxyzine and cetirizine are recommended to control pruritus. Systemic steroids are advised in severe cases. Psoralen and ultraviolet A therapy , narrow-band ultraviolet B , systemic treatment with immunomodulators (methotrexate, cyclosporine) and targeted biologics may be considered in patients with chronic dermatitis that is unresponsive to other measures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Topical minoxidil solution (consisting of minoxidil, alcohol, propylene glycol, and purified water) is a hypertrichotic agent commonly used in androgenetic alopecia. Some patients treated with topical minoxidil complain of pruritus and scaling of the scalp. The most common causes of these symptoms are irritant contact dermatitis , allergic contact dermatitis, or an exacerbation of seborrheic dermatitis. Propylene glycol is found to be the agent most frequently responsible for allergic contact dermatitis to minoxidil solution 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【36】Differential diagnoses for the presented patient included psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis and tinea capitis.\n\n【37】Scalp psoriasis is characterized by the presence of red, thickened plaques with a silver-white scale, either contained within the hairline, or extending onto the forehead, ears, and posterior neck. Other body areas such as knees, elbows and lumbosacral region are commonly affected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【38】Tinea capitis , a fungal infection of the scalp that affects mainly children. The disease is characterized by the presence of hair loss areas with coexisted scaling, inflammation or pustules 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【39】Seborrheic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory dermatologic condition. It presents as well-delimited erythematous plaques with greasy-looking, yellowish scales 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. The scalp is most commonly affected, however the disease can appear also on the other body areas such as the face, chest, back, axilla, and groin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. Seborrheic dermatitis is characterized by a seasonal pattern, presenting more frequently during winter, and improving usually during summer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【40】Based on the clinical picture, trichoscopic examination and patch tests, the presented patient was diagnosed with allergic contact dermatitis . Mometasone furoate 0.1% solution once a day was initiated with resolution of the skin lesions. A propylene glycol–free topical minoxidil solution was recommended.\n\n【41】Key Points\n\n【42】   Contact dermatitis, both irritant and allergic, rarely affects the scalp area.\n\n【43】   The disease is characterized by the presence of an erythema, papules, scaling and vesiculation.\n\n【44】   Topical minoxidil may cause irritant contact dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, or an exacerbation of seborrheic dermatitis.\n\n【45】   Propylene glycol is most frequently responsible for allergic contact dermatitis to minoxidil solution.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 13:40:34", "endTime": "2024/09/14 13:40:43", "cost": 8.779}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:02", "update_time": "2024-09-13 21:40:43", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 21:40:34"}

A CT scan is performed.\n\n【8】●Most likely diagnosis： Initially TIA versus stroke， then hemorrhagic complica-tion of rTPA.\n\n【9】Next step： All anticoagulation therapy should be stopped， hypertension should be controlled， and any coagulopathy should be corrected.\n\n【10】ANALYSIS\n\n【11】Objectives\n\n【12】1\\. To understand the causes of cerebral vascular atherosclerosis and disease.\n\n【13】2\\. To understand the treatment of ongoing stroke.\n\n【14】3\\. To understand the common complications of stroke therapies.\n\n【15】4\\. To understand the medications for the prophylaxis of stroke.\n\n【16】Considerations\n\n【17】The patient has suffered the most feared complication of rTPA treatment， which isan intracranial bleed. The internal capsule is the most common area for strokes in hyper-tensive patients. Once intracranial bleeding is identified， all anticoagulation therapies are discontinued. Controlling the BP and reversing any clotting abnormalities is essen-tial. The initial workup should include CT or MRI scans of the brain for determination of ischemic versus hemorrhagic stroke， while maintaining control of the BP. I think an extra space needs to be here? Initially， the patient has an acute nonhemorrhagic CVA. CVA is the second most common cause of death of adults in the United States. After rTPA therapy for his stroke， despite meeting all the criteria for administration ofa clot-dissolving drug rTPA， the patient succumbed to a well-identified side effect of this class of drugs and developed a hemorrhagic bleed in the area of the right internal capsule.\n\n【18】APPROACH TO：\n\n【19】Stroke and CVA rank second after ischemic heart disease (CAD) as a cause of life years lost to disability and death worldwide. The incidence of stroke varies among countries and increases exponentially with age. In Western societies， 80% of strokes are caused by focal cerebral ischemia due to arterial occlusion， and 20% are caused by hemorrhage. Ischemic brain injury culminates in anoxic cell death. Initially after 删除换行1: arterial occlusion， an area of edema with structural integrity surrounds a central core of tissue death. This is the area that can recover from the first minutes to hours of the insult. No clinical deficits and findings necessarily reflect irreversible damage. Depending on the duration and severity of the ischemia， the edematous area may be incorporated into the infarct or normal tissue.\n\n【20】Thirty-day mortality rates are in the range of 10% to 17%. Older patients do worse after stroke； poor prognosis is also noted with the coexistence of ischemic heart disease and diabetes mellitus (DM). Mortality is related to the size of the infarct； the risk of death is as low as 2.5% with lacunar infarcts and as high as 78%with space-occupying hemispheric infarcts.\n\n【21】The dictum is “time is brain tissue.\" Hence， as soon as a patient is diagnosed with possible stroke， acute imaging should be performed to rule out a hemorrhagic pro-cess and the patient screened for possible thrombolytic therapy. The treatment with intravenous rTPA (alteplase) or IV thrombolytics when started within 3 hours after the onset of symptoms are effective in limiting the severity of stroke. The recom-mended rTPA dose is 0.9 mg/kg with a maximum of 90 mg， with the first 10% being given IV over a period of 1 minute， and the remaining 90% given within 1 hour. Treatment leads to a 31% to 50% favorable neurologic or functional outcome at3 months. Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 6.4% of the rTPA group versus 0.6% in controls. Trials of Ⅳ rTPA therapy failed to find a benefit when thrombolytics were given within 6 hours after the onset of symptoms. The benefit of rTPA is greater the sooner the treatment is started.\n\n【22】Intracranial hemorrhage after thrombolysis is higher in patients with more severe， larger strokes and with older patients. Concerns of hemorrhage， the efficacy and safety of rTPA in patients with early ischemic changes on CT still exist. In the first 3 hours after the onset of symptoms， the appearance of ischemic changes on CT was not associated with increased risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage or other bleeding outcomes after rTPA treatment. IV thrombolysis with rTPA can be used in the community setting with efficacy and safety.\n\n【23】Anticoagulation\n\n【24】Ischemic stroke occurs because of a thrombus or narrowing of the arteries. ASA dosing(160 or 300 mg/d) initiated within 48 hours after the onset of stroke and contin-ued for 2 weeks leads to better survival and function by reducing risk of recurrent ischemic stroke. Routine use of ASA is recommended for secondary prevention of stroke after the first few weeks. ASA is inexpensive， has a good safety profile， and is effective in patients with ischemic stroke； however， it should be withheld for24 hours in patients treated with the use of Ⅳ thrombolytics to decrease the risk of bleeding. Dipyridamole or clopidogrel therapy in the acute phase of ischemic stroke has not been tested in randomized trials. The incidence of ischemic stroke has declined in the middle and elderly age groups but has increased in younger patients， likely due to obesity and hypertension being the contributing factors. Providers should be aware of the rising risk of stroke in younger people. The incidence of acute ischemic stroke has dramatically increased in people under age 35 in both sexes， 删除换行1: but is still greater in males. Better detection of ischemic stroke with MRI may expose obesity and hypertension as the underlying cause. The use of unfractionated heparin， low-molecular-weight heparins， heparinoids， thrombin inhibitors， or oral antico agulants in the acute phase of stroke improves functional outcomes.\n\n【25】Management of Cardiovascular Risk Factors\n\n【26】Aspirin (ASA) should be started after 24 hours (300 mg daily for the first 2 weeks) and extended release dipyridamole for secondary prevention. Aggressive management of cardiovascular risk factors including smoking cessation， treatment of hypertension， and initiating statin therapy is also recommended. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a com-mon arrhythmia that increases the risk of stroke. Warfarin (Coumadin) therapy(and now oral apixaban in nonvalvular AF) to keep the international normalized ratio (INR) between 2 and 3 is the accepted therapy. Apixaban， a direct antithrombin inhibitor， does not require monitoring of the INR. These agents have been more effec-tive than ASA for the prevention of stroke in patients with AF A narrow therapeutic window and the need for lifelong coagulation monitoring limits the use of warfarin(Coumadin). When warfarin (Coumadin) is used， maintenance of the INR in the therapeutic range is challenging and is achieved less than 60% of the time； subopti-mal anticoagulation can lead to recurrent stoke. At least a third of patients .1. with AF who are at risk for stroke are either not started on oral anticoagulant therapy or are not compliant with therapy. ASA reduces the risk of stroke in patients with AF by about 20% and is used to treat patients with atrial fibrillation for whom vitamin K antagonist therapy is contraindicated. Addition of clopidogrel to an ASA regimen in patients for whom vitamin K antagonist therapy is contraindicated further reduces the risk of stroke by 28%， but the combination increases the risk of major hemorrhage. A number of small molecular weight inhibitors of Factor Xa are currently available and can be delivered orally. Among these are rivaroxaban， apixaban， betrixaban， YM150， and DU-176b. Apixaban is a direct and competitive inhibitor of Factor Xa.\n\n【27】Prevention and Management of Complications\n\n【28】Patients with an acute stroke are at an increased risk for deep venous thrombosis(DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). This risk for DVT and PE increases with increasing age and stroke severity scores. Anticoagulant therapy does not improve the overall functional outcome， but subcutaneously administered low-dose unfrac tionated heparin (UFH) or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) are recom mended for patients at high risk for DVT and PE， and for those with immobility. Large supratentorial infarcts and space-occupying edema of the brain may lead to transtentorial or uncal herniation， usually between the second and fifth day after the onset of stroke. Intensive care units with these cases have reported early fatality rates of up to 78%. Medical therapy has proved ineffective in these cases of large space-occupying lesions. Compared to medical therapy， surgery (hemicraniectomy， dura-plasty， a dural patch to enlarge the intradural space) in the first 48 hours of the onset of stroke reduced the case fatality rate (22% vs 71%). Surgery appeared to be less beneficial for patients with aphasia， patients older than 50 years of age， and patients in whom surgery was performed on the second day versus the first day after stroke onset. Patients who received care in a stroke unit were more likely to survive， regain independence， and return home than those who do not receive such specialized care.\n\n【29】Hypercoagulable States\n\n【30】Hypercoagulable conditions can lead to strokes. The most common conditions in this group include oral contraceptive use， pregnancy， Factor V Leiden deficiency， protein C and S deficiencies， antithrombin III deficiency， and lupus anticoagulant. Patients with these conditions usually present with some form of deep venous throm-bosis. Procoagulant states should be suspected especially when recurrent episodes of deep venous thrombosis are diagnosed. Arterial thrombosis should definitely increase awareness of the presence of one of these conditions. Clots can travel from the venous circulation through the heart via an atrial or ventricular septal defect to the left side of the heart and to the arterial circulation leading to the brain (paradoxical emboli). Lupus anticoagulant is a specific immunoglobulin against phospholipids that prolongs the clotting time； it does not produce bleeding but instead a paradoxical procoagulant condition. It is seen in 25% of people with SLE， but is also seen in otherwise normal healthy subjects. In some people it is associated with an increased risk of blood clots and may be the cause of recurrent spontaneous abortions. Risk factors are SLE and a recent use of phenothiazine medication. Specialized clotting studies and levels of the factors involved are required to make an accurate diagnosis.\n\n【31】Prevention of Stroke\n\n【32】Secondary prevention of stroke and other cardiovascular complications is impor-tant. Prevention consists primarily of low-dose ASA and dipyridamole in patients with ischemic stroke， oral anticoagulation in patients with cardiac embolism， treat-ment of hypertension， statin therapy， and glucose control in patients with diabetes. Cessation of smoking and carotid endarterectomy in patients with ipsilateral carotid stenosis has been shown to be effective.\n\n【33】Even in the United States， only a minority of patients with acute ischemic stroke receive intravenous rTPA. The use of intravenous rTPA is currently restricted to a3-hour time window after the onset of symptoms with a potential benefit when used up to 6 hours after the onset of a stroke. Later use was improved by quantification of the ischemic penumbra with perfusion MRI/CT. The intent of thrombolysis is to recan-alize occluded arteries. Complete recanalization of an occluded middle cerebral artery2 hours after the start of thrombolysis was achieved in one-third of patients. In some cases， continuous 2-MHz transcranial Doppler ultrasonography applied for 2 hours simultaneous with rTPA augmented the rate of arterial recanalization. The addition of intravenous galactose-based micro bubbles may also increase rates of recanalization along with Doppler therapy. Compared with intravenous thrombolysis， intra-arterial thrombolysis may increase the likelihood of recanalization. The administration of both intra-arterial recombinant pro-urokinase and intravenous heparin， compared with intravenous heparin alone， within 6 hours after the onset of stroke resulted in a higher rate of recanalization of the middle cerebral artery (66% vs18%) and a higher rate of a favorable functional outcome at 3 months (40% vs 25%，P=0.04).\n\n【34】Procedures required to deliver intra-arterial thrombolytic agents to 1the site ofvascular occlusion involve more time than intravenous therapy. Thrombolytic ther-apy in which intravenous thrombolysis is followed by intra-arterial thrombolysis， may permit more rapid treatment and improved rates of recanalization. Mechanical thrombectomy in patients with acute intracranial occlusion of the intracranial carotid artery has resulted in a higher rate of recanalization.\n\n【35】Elevated blood pressure， hyperglycemia， and fever in the first hours to days after ischemic stroke have all been associated with poor long-term outcomes. Antihypertensive therapy during the acute phase of stroke is held unless the diastolic blood pressure exceeds 120 mm Hg or the systolic blood pressure exceeds220 mm Hg in patients who do not receive rTPA. Monitoring blood pressure is recommended before， during， and after rTPA therapy. Intravenous antihyperten-sive therapy to maintain the systolic blood pressure <185 mm Hg and the diastolic blood pressure below 110 mm Hg is recommended. Hypothermia has also improved functional outcomes in trials involving patients with global cerebral ischemia after cardiac arrest and traumatic spinal cord injury， but the improvement was not consis-tent among those with traumatic brain injury.\n\n【36】Conclusions\n\n【37】Patients with signs and symptoms of CVA strongly suggestive of stroke should undergo prompt brain imaging (CT or MRI). MRI is more sensitive for early ischemic changes， but either method can fully rule out hemorrhage. In the absence of bleeding or other contraindications to thrombolysis such as spontaneous， complete clearing of the deficits， increase in BP to or>185/110 mm Hg， or presentation >3 hours (possibly6 hours) after the onset of symptoms， the patient should receive therapy with intra-venous rTPA. Cardiovascular risk factors should be addressed， and anticoagulation should be initiated when atrial fibrillation is present.\n\n【38】Compared to ASA， apixaban had superior efficacy in reducing the risk for embolic events in patients with AF It has a 50% level of bioavailability， and is partially excreted by the kidneys. Apixaban， at a dose of 2.5 mg twice daily is effective and safe for the prevention of DVT after elective orthopedic surgery. The direct throm-bin inhibitor dabigatran gained a Class I recommendation as a useful alternative to warfarin (Coumadin) for the prevention of stroke and systemic thromboem-bolism in patients with paroxysmal to permanent AF. Risk factors fo OXyr stroke or systemic embolization are increased in patients with prosthetic heart valves， hemo-dynamically significant valvular disease， renal failure (creatinine clearance <15 mL/min)， and advanced liver disease (impaired baseline clotting function).\n\n【39】Routinely switching patients to dabigatran who are already successfully taking war-farin is not recommended and remains an individual decision. Dabigatran requires a twice daily dosing and greater risk of nonhemorrhagic side effects； thus， patients already taking warfarin with excellent INR control have little to gain by changing to dabigatran. The patient's compliance with a twice-daily dosing is a real issue. Management to sustain monitoring of INR is needed with warfarin also adds to cost and compliance. Most studies demonstrate a benefit to routine blood-pressure low-ering treatment in the acute phase of stroke.\n\n【40】Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are effective after ischemic stroke. Some SSRIs improved motor recovery after stroke but this has not been universally confirmed. Fewer fluoxetine recipients than placebo recipients had depression and treatment with thrombolytic agents did not alter the findings. The SSRIs are therapeutic treatment of stroke and should be considered as an adjunct to 删除换行1: physiotherapy in the rehabilitation of motor deficits in moderate-to-severe stroke. Reports of a decreased effect of clopidrogel in patients taking proton pump inhibi tors (PPI) did not conclude that there was an increase in the risk for a recurrence of stroke in clopidogrel/PPI users. Vitamin supplementation did not prevent major CV events in patients with previous myocardial infarction， unstable angina， or stroke.\n删除16：<u>CLINICAL CASE CORRELATION\n删除25：<u>See also Case 3 (Scoring Systems and Patient Prognosis)， Case 27(Traumatic Brain Injury)， Case 30 (Altered Mental Status)， and Case 31(Status Epilepticus).</u>\n</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 13:40:59", "endTime": "2024/09/14 13:41:12", "cost": 13.04}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:02", "update_time": "2024-09-13 21:41:12", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 21:40:59"}

During the latter, there may be biting of the tongue or frothy sputum seen coming out  删除换行1: of the mouth, as well as loss of bowel or bladder continence.

Concurrently, an infusion of fosphenytoin or phe删除8：<u>￾</u>nytoin should be established, with alternatives including sodium valproate or levetiracetam  删除换行1: if the patient has intolerance to phenytoin. Metabolic abnormalities should be corrected,  删除换行1: but if the patient continues to remain in status epilepticus, expert opinion from Neurology  删除换行1: should be obtained and consideration given towards sedation with propofol, midazolam or  删除换行1: pentobarbital, and the patient transferred to an intensive care setting.\n\n【16】The ED evaluation of a first seizure should begin with obtaining a thorough history of the  删除换行1: episode, both from the patient and any witnesses, paying particular attention to any preced删除8：<u>￾</u>ing or triggering events, medication or substance use and family history of seizure disorders. \n\n【17】The physical examination should focus on assessing for any localising neurologic signs, and  删除换行1: also to evaluate any injuries that the patient may have sustained during the seizure. Key blood  删除换行1: tests that need to be checked include those aforementioned, and urine toxicology could be  删除换行1: performed to look for substance abuse.

Once the seizure has resolved, management  删除换行1: should proceed along the ‘ABCDE’ approach, with airway support and supplementary oxygen  删除换行1: administration if needed (e.g. head tilt manoeuvre). Intravenous access should be established, and  删除换行1: a point-of-care glucose must always be checked as hypoglycaemia is a common cause of seizure.\n\n【13】Status epilepticus is defined as at least 5 minutes of continuous seizures and/or at least two  删除换行1: discrete seizure episodes between which consciousness is not fully regained. It is a medical  删除换行1: emergency and must always be considered when dealing with a seizing patient. If a patient  删除换行1: is suspected of being in status epilepticus, initial assessment and management should focus  删除换行1: on securing the airway (with intubation and mechanical ventilation if needed), providing  删除换行1: supplemental oxygen to maintain saturation >94% and establishing intravenous access. \n\n【14】Emergent investigations should focus on toxic-metabolic causes (i.e. extended electrolytes,  删除换行1: glucose, liver function, toxicology, anti-epileptic drug levels), and pharmacologic therapy  删除换行1: with benzodiazepines as described above should be initiated with a maximum of two doses. \n\n【15】Administration of thiamine and dextrose should be considered, particularly if there is a sus删除8：<u>￾</u>picion for alcohol excess or malnutrition. Concurrently, an infusion of fosphenytoin or phe删除8：<u>￾</u>nytoin should be established, with alternatives including sodium valproate or levetiracetam  删除换行1: if the patient has intolerance to phenytoin. Metabolic abnormalities should be corrected,  删除换行1: but if the patient continues to remain in status epilepticus, expert opinion from Neurology  删除换行1: should be obtained and consideration given towards sedation with propofol, midazolam or  删除换行1: pentobarbital, and the patient transferred to an intensive care setting.\n\n【16】The ED evaluation of a first seizure should begin with obtaining a thorough history of the  删除换行1: episode, both from the patient and any witnesses, paying particular attention to any preced删除8：<u>￾</u>ing or triggering events, medication or substance use and family history of seizure disorders. \n\n【17】The physical examination should focus on assessing for any localising neurologic signs, and  删除换行1: also to evaluate any injuries that the patient may have sustained during the seizure. Key blood  删除换行1: tests that need to be checked include those aforementioned, and urine toxicology could be  删除换行1: performed to look for substance abuse. An electrocardiogram should be performed, as car删除8：<u>￾</u>diac syncope may manifest similarly to a seizure, while some form of neuroimaging (CT or  删除换行3: MRI) is required in all adults presenting with their first seizure to look for a structural cause. \n\n【18】Finally, the decision to pursue specialised testing (lumbar puncture and electroencephalo删除8：<u>￾</u>gram [EEG]) is made on a case-by-case basis, with lumbar puncture only done if there is  删除换行1: concern for an infectious aetiology and once space-occupying lesions have been excluded,  删除换行1: and urgent EEG needed in patients who do not return to their baseline state within 30– 删除换行1: 60 minutes of the seizure.\nCase 27: Seizure and urinary incontinence\n\n【19】Key Points\n\n【20】• Most seizures resolve spontaneously within 1 or 2 minutes, and pharmacotherapy  删除换行1: with benzodiazepines is not usually required.\n\n【21】• Status epilepticus is a medical emergency and defined by at least 5 minutes of  删除换行1: continuous seizure activity and/or at least two seizure episodes between which  删除换行1: consciousness is not fully regained.\n\n【22】• Neuroimaging (with CT or MRI) is mandatory in any adult presenting to the \n\n【23】Emergency Department with a first seizure, either on initial presentation or on an  删除换行1: urgent outpatient basis.删除9：<u>http://taylorandfrancis.com95</u>", "index": 6118, "show": true, "start": 6118, "end": 6233, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:21:00", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:22:12", "cost": 71.87}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:02", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:22:10", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:20:58"}

Papulosquamous diseases are characterized by scaling papules (raised lesions <1 cm in diameter) and plaques (raised lesions >1 cm in diameter).\n\n【19】Other papulosquamousCdiseases iinclude tinea infections， pityriasis rosea and lichen planus.\n\n【20】152Psoriasis\n\n【21】The lesions of psoriasis are distinct and are classically very well circum-scribed， circular， red papules or plaques with a grey or silvery-white， dry scale. In addition， the lesions are typically distributed symmetrically on the scalp， elbows， knees， lumbosacral area and in the body folds.\n\n【22】How common is this condition?\n\n【23】It affects 1-2% of the population of the UK.\n\n【24】What are the typical features of psoriatic plaques?\n\n【25】Distinguishing features include：\n\n【26】● silvery colour of the scaling\n\n【27】● the moist red surface on removal of the scales (Bulkeley's membrane) 删除换行1: capillary bleeding when the individual silvery scales are plucked from the plaque (Auspitz's sign) 删除换行1: new skin lesions at the site of trauma (Koebner’s phenomenon).\n\n【28】ADVANCED-LEVEL QUESTIONS\n\n【29】How is the severity of involvement usually estimated?\n\n【30】·The patient's own perception of the disability\n\n【31】● Objective assessment of disability.\n\n【32】It is usually estimated by using the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)， which takes into consideration the area of involvement， thickness， redness and scaling. The maximal score on this index is 72， with mild， moderate and severe having scores of <10， 10-50 and >50， respectively.\n\n【33】What are the types of psoriasis?\n\n【34】· Depending on the natural history\n\n【35】Type 1： young patients with a strong family history， has a more aggres-sive disorder\n\n【36】Type 2： older patients with no family history， has a more indolent course.\n\n【37】Depending on the nature of skin lesion\n\n【38】Chronic plaque psoriasis\n\n【39】With gradual peripheral extension， plaques may develop different con-figurations including：\n\n【40】●psoriasis gyrata， in which curved linear patterns predominate\n\n【41】●annular psoriasis， in which ring-like lesions develop secondary to central clearing\n\n【42】● psoriasis follicularis， in which minute scaly papules are present at the openings of pilosebaceous follicles.\n\n【43】●\n\n【44】Rupioid and ostraceous， which relate to distinct morphological subtypes of plaque psoriasis：\n\n【45】●Rupioid plaques are small (2-5 cm in diameter) and highly hyperk-eratotic， resembling limpet shells\n\n【46】● Ostraceouspsoriasis are hyperkeratotic plaques with relatively concave centres， similar in shape to oyster shells.\n\n【47】Inverse psoriasis： plaques evolve in the intertriginous areas and， there-fore， lack the typical silver scale appearance because of moisture and maceration\n\n【48】●Guttate psoriasis： numerous small popular lesions with silvery scaling evolve suddenly over the body surface\n\n【49】● Pustular psoriasis： can be localized or generalized； superficial pustules may stud the plaques\n\n【50】●Erythrodermic psoriasis： generalized erythema and scaling； can be life threatening.\n\n【51】What do you know about the genetics of psoriasis?\n\n【52】·Clear identification of the causative gene has been difficult because of the extensive linkage disequilibrium (i.e. genes on one chromosome are inherited together and are not easily separable by recombination events) observed within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC).\n\n【53】The major genetic determinant of psoriasis is PSORS1， which probably accounts for 35-50% of the heritability of the disease in multiple genom-ewide studies. PSORS1 is located within the MHC on chromosome 6p. Guttate psoriasis (an acute-onset form usually occurring in adolescents) is strongly associated with PSORS1，whereas late-onset cases of psoriasis vulgaris (usually in persons >50 years of age) and palmoplantar pustu-losis are not associated with PSORS1.\n\n【54】● In a genomewide association study， polymorphisms in the genes for interleukin-12 (IL12B) and interleukin-23 (IL23R) are associated with psoriasis. These interleukins are cytokines that induce naive CD4 T cells to differentiate into type 1 helper T cells (Th1 cells) and type 17 helper T cells (Th17 cells)， respectively； they have been identified as key media-tors of psoriasis.\n\n【55】What do you know about the pathology of plaque psoriasis?\n\n【56】●Hyperproliferation of the epidermis\n\n【57】● Inflammation of the epidermis and dermis.\n\n【58】What do you understand by the term Koebner's phenomenon?

He was quickly found and rescued by another swimmer from the lake bottom. The patient was noted to be apneic， and cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was initiated by one of the bystanders. After the paramedics arrived， the patient was noted to have spontaneous shallow respira-tions， a weak palpable pulse， and Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score of 7 (eyes 1， verbal 2， motor 4). The paramedics intubated the patient and transported him to the emergency department (ED). In the ED， the patient has an initial pulse of70 beats per minute， blood pressure of 110/70 mm Hg， temperature of 35.6℃(96.1°F)， GCS score of 6 (eyes 1， verbal 1， motor 4)， and oxygen saturation of 92%on 100% FiO.\n\n【1】What are the complications associated with this condition?\n\n【2】What is the best treatment for this patient?\n\n【3】ANSWERS TO CASE 43：\n\n【4】Summary： A teenage boy presents with near-drowning following a diving accident at a lake.\n\n【5】Complications： Submersion injury results in global hypoxia and tissue ischemia primarily affecting the brain， lungs， and heart. Early complications include non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema， hypoxic encephalopathy， respiratory and meta-bolic acidosis， dysrhythmias， and renal impairment. Coagulopathy， electrolyte abnormalities， and hemodilution or hemoconcentration are rare but possible sequela. Pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome can occur later in the patient's hospital course.\n\n【6】Best treatment： The most important treatment to optimize outcome is rapid ini-tiation of resuscitation in the prehospital setting (ie， stabilizing the ABCs). To this end， bystander CPR can be vitally important. Victims of submersion injury often require aggressive respiratory support， which may range from administra-tion of supplemental oxygen to intubation. If cervical spine injury is suspected(as in this patient who dove off a platform)， cervical spine stabilization should be maintained until spinal trauma is ruled out.\n\n【7】Objectives\n\n【8】1\\. Learn the pathophysiology of submersion injury.\n\n【9】2\\. Become familiar with the epidemiology and prevention of drowning.\n\n【10】3\\. Learn the special problems associated with cold-water-submersion injury.\n\n【11】Considerations\n\n【12】The initial management of patients with submersion injury is stabilization of the ABCs and correction of hypoxemia. In the ED， all of these patients require continuous cardiac monitoring and pulse oximetry. Initial diagnostics may include a complete blood count， blood glucose， electrolytes， creatinine， arterial blood gas， and chest x-ray. This patient will need to be admitted to the ICU where continued cardiopulmonary monitoring and mechanical ventilation support can be provided.\n\n【13】When encountering a patient with a submersion injury， the ED physician must always consider whether any precipitants exist that also require treatment. These precipitants may include alcohol or drug intoxication， seizures， hypoglycemia， car-diac arrest， attempted suicide or homicide， and child abuse or neglect. In addition， if the submersion is associated with a history of trauma (eg， diving into water， motor vehicle collision)， cervical spine and head injuries are considerations. Hypothermia should also be considered if the patient is submersed in cold water. After the patient is hemodynamically stable， radiographic imaging of the cervical spine (plain x-rays 删除换行1: or computed tomography \\[CT\\]) and CT of the head may be necessary to rule out concomitant injury.\n\n【14】APPROACH TO：\n\n【15】DEFINITIONS\n\n【16】DROWNING： Death following a submersion event.\n\n【17】SUBMERSION VICTIM： Patient with some degree of submersion distress requir-ing medical evaluation and treatment.\n\n【18】IMMERSION SYNDROME： Syncope or sudden death that occurs after submer-sion in water that is at least 5℃ less than body temperature. Due to dysrhythmias induced by vagal stimulation.\n\n【19】CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【20】Epidemiology and Prevention\n\n【21】Drowning is the fourth most common cause of accidental death in the United States. In children 1 to 14 years old， it is the second leading cause of death (behind motor vehicle collisions). Risk factors for drowning include age， gender， and race. The incidence of submersion injuries peaks in toddlers and young children， adolescents and young adults， and in the elderly. However， drowning deaths are most common in toddlers and older teenagers. Males account for 80% of drowning victims older than 12 months. Between 15 to 19 years of age， black boys have drowning rates 12to 15 times higher than those of white boys.\n\n【22】Alcohol use and other medical conditions have also been associated with an increased risk of submersion injuries. Among teenagers and adults， alcohol use may be a contributing factor in 30% to 50% of drownings. Seizures， autism， and other devel-opmental and behavioral disorders also increase the risk of drowning. In patients with prolonged QT syndrome， immersion in cold water may further extend the QT interval.\n\n【23】Submersion injuries can occur in natural bodies of water (freshwater and saltwa-ter) as well as in domestic settings (such as bathtubs and swimming pools). Infants may even drown in toilets or buckets of water. However， if the infant is less than6 months old or has an atypical presentation， healthcare providers should maintain a high suspicion for abuse. Efforts to decrease the incidence of submersion injuries and drowning deaths have focused on educating the public and increasing awareness of preventive measures. Preventive measures include adequate fencing around pools， decreasing the use of alcohol when engaged in water sports， increasing the super-vision of children playing in or near water， and increasing the number of citizens trained in CPR. Water safety education for children， teenagers， and parents that encourages wearing flotation devices and never swimming alone should be rein-forced in the school， community， and physician's office.\n\n【24】Pathophysiology of Submersion Injuries\n\n【25】Victims of submersion injuries initially hold their breaths. As hypoxia and air hun-ger develop， they eventually involuntarily swallow and aspirate water. After aspira-tion of 1 to 3 mL/kg of water， dilution and washout of surfactant occurs， resulting in atelectasis， decreased gas exchange across the alveoli， non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema， and ventilation-perfusion mismatch. This leads to worsening hypoxia and respiratory and metabolic acidosis. If this process continues， neuronal death and cardiovascular collapse ensue.\n\n【26】“Dry drowning”is a term that was traditionally used to refer to drowning deaths that occurred without aspiration of a significant amount of water (perhaps due to severe laryngospasm， hypoxia， and loss of consciousness). However， the medical lit-erature does not support this mechanism of injury. Dry drownings are probably due to causes besides simple submersion.\n\n【27】Management\n\n【28】Patients with submersion injuries may present with signs of pulmonary and central nervous system dysfunction or dysrhythmias. The patient may arrive in extremis with hypoxia， cyanosis， severe respiratory distress， or respiratory arrest. Other pul-monary findings may include tachypnea， wheezes， rales， or rhonchi. Neurologically， patient presentations may range from a mild alteration of consciousness to coma. Neurological deficits at the time of initial evaluation do not necessarily portend a poor patient outcome. Dysrhythmias are mainly the result of hypoxemia and acido-sis and may include ventricular fibrillation， ventricular tachycardia， and bradycardia asystole. Patients with severe submersion injury may develop acute respiratory dis-tress syndrome， hypoxic encephalopathy， or cardiac arrest.\n\n【29】All patients should be placed on continuous cardiac monitoring and pulse oxim-etry in the ED. An ECG is useful to rule out QT prolongation and dysrhythmias. A chest x-ray should also be performed to identify any infiltrates or pulmonary edema with the caveat that initial x-ray findings may progress over time. Although they are often normal at first， a baseline complete blood count， electrolytes， creatinine， and glucose should be obtained. Arterial blood gases may be helpful in monitoring for acidosis， hypercarbia， and hypoxemia. If a concern for rhabdomyolysis exists， serum creatinine kinase and urine myoglobin levels may be useful.\n\n【30】One of the most critical elements in the successful management of submersion victims is prompt and effective basic life support delivery in the prehospital setting. The Heimlich maneuver is no longer recommended to expel fluid from the lungs because of the high rate of aspiration induced by this maneuver and because of the delay it causes in initiation of ventilation. An awake patient with mild respira-tory symptoms may benefit from noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) although a risk of gastric distention and vomiting does exist with the use of NIPPV. Indications for intubation include a lack of protective airway reflexes， respiratory distress， hypercarbia， hypoxia (despite noninvasive oxygen delivery)， and apnea.\n\n【31】Intravenous fluids consisting of lactated Ringer solution or normal saline should be initiated in most victims. Glucose containing solutions are generally contraindi-cated except in hypoglycemic patients. Scientific investigations indicate that glucose solutions may worsen the neurological outcome in animals that have incomplete 删除换行1: cerebral ischemia. In general， empiric antibiotics are not indicated for patients with submersion injuries. Antibiotics may benefit patients who were submerged in grossly contaminated water or manifest signs of infection.\n\n【32】Patients who are asymptomatic may be observed in the ED for 4 to 6 hours. If they maintain normal oxygen saturations on room air and have normal pulmonary examinations and chest x-rays， they may be discharged home. Admission is required for patients who are symptomatic， have been unconscious or hypoxic or apneic， have an abnormal chest x-ray， or have evidence of dysrhythmia.\n\n【33】Cold Water Submersion Injury\n\n【34】Submersion in cold water may be more advantageous than submersion in warm water due to induction of the diving reflex and hypothermia. In the diving reflex， blood is shunted away from the victim's peripheral tissues to the heart and brain， decreas-ing metabolism and reducing anoxic injury. This reflex is strongest in children less than 6 months old and decreases with age. The protective effects of this reflex may partially account for reports of complete neurological recovery in children after pro-longed submersion. Hypothermia has been theorized to be neuroprotective because of the induction of global hypometabolic state， leading to the conservation of oxy-gen and glucose for brain metabolism. Cold water also has potentially deleterious effects， most significantly cardiac irritability (leading to dysrhythmias)， exhaustion， and altered mental status. Although some case reports have described patients who survived prolonged submersion in cold water， hypothermia is usually a poor prog-nostic indicator.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:06:14", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:08:56", "cost": 162.601}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:02", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:08:56", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:06:13"}

Other features are dysarthria,  删除换行1: diplopia and ptosis which occur in myasthenia gravis. He also has autonomic fea删除8：<u>￾</u>tures (dry mouth and postural hypotension). These are characteristic of Lambert–Eaton  删除换行1: myasthenic syndrome (LEMS). Malignancy is associated with half of LEMS cases.

Approximately 18 months after his initial sensory symptoms, he developed dysphagia to solids and liquids. He had frequent emesis and early satiety, and he was only able to eat one small meal a day. Due to these symptoms, he lost over 30 lbs. His symptoms progressed, and his voice became hoarse and lower-pitched. He developed urinary hesitancy and severe constipation. He would frequently become light-headed when going from sitting to standing. Three years after the development of his symptoms, he began to lose strength in his hands, and he became weak in his lower extremities. At that point, he was walking with a cane, and his toes began to “curl.” The pain that was initially in his feet subsequently spread to his legs and hands. Unfortunately, the pain was severe and refractory to multiple trials of different medications.\n\n【3】What are the salient features of his history that help us localize the lesion? Can we localize his GI symptoms and weight loss to his neurologic syndrome, or are these related but systemic manifestations of a systemic disease? If these symptoms are neurologic, how might that tie into his urinary dysfunction or orthostasis? A unique or unexpected symptom can be an important localizing clue.

Mental status and cranial nerve examination was normal except for a mildly dysphonic voice. He was weak in his bilateral upper and lower extremities, worse distally in the hands and feet compared to proximally, and better than anti-gravity throughout. He had high-arched feet bilaterally, and he had wasting of the intrinsic muscles of his hands and feet . There were fasciculations in his forearms and legs. Reflexes were barely detectable in the upper extremities and absent in the lower extremities, and his plantar reflex was mute. Pinprick sensation was absent up to the thighs bilaterally in the lower extremities and the elbows in the bilateral upper extremities. Proprioception was absent in the toes and fingers. He had a positive Romberg test. He walked with a cane and had a prominent steppage gait.### What is the pace?\n\n【6】His symptoms evolved over years without any events that occurred on a faster time scale, so the pace is chronic.### What is the localization?\n\n【7】First, we need to determine if this is a central or a peripheral process. Based on the history, his initial symptoms were a sharp and icy pain in his feet, which could be consistent with a peripheral length-dependent neuropathy. However, he also has prominent and early dysphagia, bowel, and bladder symptoms. At first glance, this could seem like a clue toward a lesion in the CNS such as the brainstem or spinal cord. However, his exam shows a clear “stocking-glove” distribution of sensory and motor dysfunction as well as absent reflexes and fasciculations (spontaneous lower motor neuron action potentials, which can be caused by damage or irritation to the cell membrane). All of these features point to a disorder of the peripheral nervous system.\n\n【8】His early dysphagia, bowel, and bladder symptoms don’t seem to fit with a typical length-dependent neuropathy (such as the neuropathy caused by longstanding uncontrolled diabetes). All of these processes—digestion, bowel and bladder control, as well as blood pressure—are regulated by the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Remember, the ANS typically comprises preganglionic neurons (cell body located in the CNS) and postganglionic neurons (cell body located in the PNS). The nerves to those various organs aren’t particularly lengthy.\n\n【9】When encountering a patient for the first time years into an illness, the current symptoms and examination may falsely localize the syndrome that was apparent at the onset of disease. For example, a patient with longstanding, untreated mononeuritis multiplex may have an examination consistent with a length-dependent polyneuropathy solely because of the accumulated burden of nerves involved over time. Because he has had symptoms for a few years, let’s focus on just the early symptoms for our localization.\n\n【10】Given the presence of both a length-dependent sensory neuropathy and autonomic neuropathy, the localization is unlikely to be based on the typical geographic divisions of the peripheral nervous system (radiculopathy, plexopathy, neuropathy, etc.). However, we can also localize the lesion based on the subset of neurons or fibers (such as the anterior horn cells in ALS). With that clue in mind, can we localize his early satiety, bowel and bladder dysfunction, and orthostasis to a similar subset of neurons as those causing his sensory symptoms?\n\n【11】Table 25.1 provides a broad overview of the different types of nerve fibers. Some peripheral nerve fibers have a small diameter whereas others have a large diameter. Not all fibers are myelinated; some are unmyelinated. Pain and temperature as well as the autonomic nervous system are composed of small-diameter fibers, and postganglionic autonomic fibers tend to be unmyelinated. Although he also develops dysfunction of motor neurons as well as proprioception, which are both mediated by large-diameter fibers, this only occurs later in the disease course.\n\n【12】Table 25.1 Nerve fiber type organized by relative diameter\n\n| Relative diameter | Nerve fiber type | Function | Myelination | Conduction velocity (m/s) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Large | A α | Somatic motor, touch and pressure | Yes | 70–120 |\n|  | 1a | Muscle spindle afferents (proprioception–muscle length) | Yes | 70–120 |\n|  | 1b | Golgi tendon organ afferents (proprioception–muscle tension) | Yes | 70–120 |\n| Medium | A β | Touch and pressure | Yes | 30–70 |\n|  | A γ | Spindle afferents (proprioception–muscle speed) | Yes | 10–50 |\n|  | II | Secondary afferents | Yes | 30–70 |\n| Small | A δ | Pain (fast, sharp) and temperature | Yes | 4–30 |\n|  | B | Preganglionic autonomic and visceral | Yes (light) | 3–30 |\n|  | III | Pressure and pain | Yes | 4–30 |\n|  | C | Slow pain, postganglionic autonomic | No | 0.5–2 |\n|  | IV | Pain (slow, dull) and temperature | No | 0.5–2 |\n删除21：<u>Adapted from Benarroch, Cutsforth-Gregory, and Flemming, Mayo Clinic Medical Neurosciences: Organized by Neurologic System and Level . Reprinted with permission from Oxford University Press © 2017.</u>\nThe onset of his symptoms, with early and severe pain and autonomic dysfunction, points to a neuropathy that involves the small-fiber peripheral nerves in the peripheral and autonomic nervous systems early on in the course of a chronic syndrome. This can be a clue to the underlying pathophysiology as to why these small fibers might be particularly vulnerable to his underlying disorder.### What is the syndromic diagnosis?\n\n【14】He has chronic onset of peripheral and autonomic nervous system dysfunction with early/prominent small-fiber compared to large-fiber involvement.### What is the etiologic diagnosis?\n\n【15】We know this is a chronic disorder, so our etiologic differential diagnosis includes neurodegenerative diseases, genetic disorders, and drugs/toxins/metabolic. Given his young age and the fact that this doesn’t fit any typical neurodegenerative disorder, we are left with this being either a genetic disorder or one caused by some sort of environmental exposure (such as a toxin or vitamin deficiency). In this case, a large laboratory work-up is surely indicated; however, we can use the principles we worked through earlier to vastly narrow down our differential diagnosis and the testing we order.\n\n【16】He presented with a chronically progressive neuropathy with key characteristics of both large- and small-fiber nerve involvement. There were early prominent features of small-fiber damage, as manifested by his autonomic dysfunction and length-dependent, severely painful neuropathy. We will need to target any work-up of these possible causes only to genetic or environmental diseases that cause this exact type of chronic polyneuropathy with notable early onset of small-fiber and autonomic involvement (syndromic diagnosis).### Conclusion\n\n【17】Ultimately, the pathologic diagnosis was transthyretin familial amyloid polyneuropathy (TTR-FAP), which was only diagnosed based on the results of genetic testing. This is a disease caused by a mutation in transthyretin (TTR), a serum protein that transports thyroxine and retinol.

C1 plays no part in the alternative pathway of complement activation， so complement activation by the alternative pathway is not affected. The terminal com-ponents are not affected either. The unregulated activation of the early complement components does not lead to the formation of the C3/C5 convertase ， so the terminal components are not abnormally activated. The depletion of the early components of the classical pathway does not affect the response to the normal acti-vation of complement by bound antibody because the amplification of the response through the alternative pathway compensates for the deficiency in C4 and C2.\n\n【11】Answer 3\n\n【12】This is not hard to explain； as we have already remarked， the alternative pathway of complement activation is intact and thus， although the classical pathway is affected by deficiencies in C2 and C4， these are compensated for by the potent amplification step from the alternative pathway.\n\n【13】Answer 4\n\n【14】In practice， you would administer epinephrine immediately in any case， because most such emergencies are due to anaphylactic reactions and because epineph-rine is a harmless drug. If the laryngeal edema is anaphylactic， it will respond to the epinephrine. If it is due to hereditary angioedema， it will not. Anaphylactic edema is also likely to be accompanied by urticaria and itching， and the patient may have been exposed to a known allergen. Most patients know if they are allergic or have a hereditary disease， and they should be asked whether they have had a similar prob-lem before.\n\n【15】Answer5\n\n【16】HAE does not skip generations： it is therefore likely that its effects are dominant. It clearly affects both males and females， so it cannot be sex-linked. If the gene has a dominant phenotype， and Richard's two children are normal， then it follows they cannot have inherited the defective gene from their father， and their children cannot inherit the disease from them.\n\n【17】Richard has inherited his abnormal ClINH gene from his mother. Because he has a normal ClINH gene from his father， you might expect that he would have 50% of the normal level of ClINH. However， the tests performed by his immunologist revealed16% of the normal level. In general， functional ClINH tests in HAE patients reveal between 5% and 30% of normal activity. How could this be explained? There are two possibilities： decreased synthesis (that is， less than 50% synthesis from only one gene)orincreased consumption of C1INH as a result of increased Cl activation. Both explanations have been shown to be correct.

The teacher has noticed the child frequently makes long-winded speeches about boats in class and is often rocking back and forth in his seat. On further history taking, the child’s mother states that he is very independent with few friends, and has always been interested in boats, preferring them over all other toys. You observe that his speech is monotone and restricted in volume and rate and he never makes eye contact with you or his mother.

This parent should be reassured, as this child’s behavior and development is most likely a variant of normal.\n\n【5】E. It is probable that one of the vaccinations is responsible for this child’s clinical findings.\n\n【6】Answer: 54.1 A . While at first glance the concerns of this child’s teacher and mother may sound typical for ADHD, your clinical suspicion should be that the child has Asperger syndrome, based on a history of monotone, restricted speech limited to only one topic of interest, lack of eye contact, lack of peer relationships appropriate to developmental age, and the repetitive, nonfunctional, atypical behavior of rocking and twirling. Appropriate steps at this time include a complete history and physical examination accompanied by an Asperger-specific screening tool and immediate referral to a developmental pediatrician for a complete evaluation. You should reassure the child’s mother that immunizations are not implicated in the cause of developmental disorders and administer any vaccines needed. You should not delay your diagnostic workup for a developmental disorder for any reason. Although immunizations are important, for this child’s situation, evaluation of the developmental problems is of higher priority.\n\n【7】Question: 54.2 Which of the following statements is accurate?\n\n【8】A. A previously healthy, normally developing 3-year-old child begins to lose bladder control and will no longer speak in sentences, but you should not be too concerned because this began after the birth of her younger sibling and she just wants more attention from her parents.\n\n【9】B.

You counsel the parents of a 6-year-old son with autism that their second child is at increased risk for having an ASD.\n\n【12】Answer: 54.2 D . Family studies estimate a recurrence risk of as much as 5% to 6% when there is an older sibling with an ASD. Red flag symptoms indicating the need for an immediate evaluation for an ASD include loss of language or social skills at any age and no use of single words by 16 months of age. Although most children with an ASD will retain their diagnosis and exhibit residual signs of their disorder into adulthood, children with ASDs who begin treatment at a younger age have significantly better outcomes, and one of the goals of treatment is to foster independence.\n\n【13】Question: 54.3 Which of the following observations during a clinical examination is concerning for the presence of an ASD?\n\n【14】A. You walk into the examination room and find a 36-month-old child pretending to have tea with her imaginary friend.\n\n【15】B. A 12-month-old child walks over to the sink, and points toward the faucet, but only utters, “Uh,” and does not say water.\n\n【16】C. A 2-year-old child is holding tightly to a tattered old blanket, which his mother says he will not leave the house without.\n\n【17】D. You tap an 18-month-old child on the shoulder, say, “Look!” and point to a toy in the corner of the room, but the child ignores you and continues to spin the wheels on his toy car.\nAnswer: 54.3 D . The child in answer choice (D) demonstrates a deficit in joint attention, one of the most distinguishing characteristics of very young children with ASDs. It is the lack of pretend play skills, rather than their presence choice (A), that is concerning for an ASD. As demonstrated in answer choice (B) at about 12 to 14 months of age, a typically developing child will begin to request a desired object that is out of reach by pointing, and, depending on the child’s speech skills, may utter simple sounds or actual words. Similar to answer choice (C), most children will form attachments during their early development with a stuffed animal, special pillow, or blanket. However, children with ASDs may prefer hard items such as ballpoint pens, keys, or flashlights.\n\n【18】CLINICAL PEARL\n\n【19】 Common features shared by all the ASDs include severe deficits in social skills and limited, repetitive, and stereotyped behavior patterns.

It is essential for many biochemical processes in the body, including DNA synthesis and red blood cell synthesis. Recently, folate supplementation has been found to be important in the prevention of fetal neural tube defects, such as anencephaly (absence of brain cerebral cortex and no skull or skin covering the brain) and spina bifida (spinal cord malformation, whereby the meninges are exposed leading to neurologic deficits). In particular, people who abuse alcohol are at risk for folate deficiency because of impaired gastrointestinal absorption and poor nutrition. Macrocytic anemia (large red blood cells) may be seen with folate deficiency. Treatment consists of folic acid replacement (usually 1 mg/day) by mouth with correction of anemia over the following 1 to 2 months. The diet usually requires adjustment, and correctable causes addressed (malnutrition in this case). Notably, folate deficiency in pregnancy has been associated with neural tube defects (NTDs) in fetuses. It is recommended that mothers take at least 400 μg of folic acid 3 months prior to conception to reduce the risk of NTD. At times, more than 400 μg of folic acid per day is recommended prior to conception. Some specific examples include a history of previous NTD, sickle cell disease, multiple gestations, and Crohn disease.\n\n【12】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【13】#### Folate and DNA Synthesis\n\n【14】### OBJECTIVES\n\n【15】1\\. Understand the important metabolic roles of folic acid with production of thymine, purine synthesis, and methionine.\n\n【16】2\\. Be aware of how folate deficiency causes megaloblastic anemia.\n\n【17】### DEFINITIONS\n\n【18】S-ADENOSYL METHIONINE: An important carrier of activated methyl groups. It is formed by the condensation of ATP with the amino acid methionine catalyzed by the enzyme methionine adenosyltransferase in a reaction that releases triphosphate.\n\n【19】DIHYDROFOLATE REDUCTASE: The enzyme that reduces folic acid (folate) first to dihydrofolate and then to the active tetrahydrofolate. Dihydrofolate reductase uses NADPH as the source of the reducing equivalents for the reaction.\n\n【20】FOLIC ACID: An essential vitamin composed of a pteridine ring bound to p-aminobenzoate, which is in an amide linkage to one or more glutamate residues. The active form of the enzyme is tetrahydrofolate (THF; FH <sub>4 </sub> ), which is an important carrier of 1-carbon units in a variety of oxidation states.\n\n【21】MEGALOBLASTIC ANEMIA: An anemia characterized by macrocytic (large) erythrocytes produced by abnormal proliferation of erythroid precursors in the bone marrow due to a limitation in normal DNA synthesis. The cytoplasm continues to grow, even though the nucleus cannot due to DNA synthesis problems.\n\n【22】METHOTREXATE: One of a number of antifolate drugs, methotrexate, is an analog of folate that competitively inhibits dihydrofolate reductase. Because a plentiful supply of THF is required for ongoing synthesis of the pyrimidine nucleotide thymidylate, synthesis of this nucleotide is inhibited, resulting in decreased DNA synthesis.\n\n【23】METHYL TRAP: The sequestering of tetrahydrofolate as N通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>5 </sup></u> \\-methyl THF because of decreased conversion of homocysteine to methionine as a result of a deficiency of methionine synthase or its cofactor, cobalamin (vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> ).\n\n【24】### DISCUSSION\n\n【25】Folate (folic acid) is an essential vitamin, which, in its active form of THF , transfers 1-carbon groups to intermediates in metabolism. Folate plays an important role in DNA synthesis. It is required for the de novo synthesis of purines and for the conversion of deoxyuridine 5-monophosphate (dUMP) to deoxythymidine 5 ′- monophosphate (dTMP). In addition, folate derivatives participate in the biosynthesis of choline, serine, glycine, and methionine. However, in situations of folate deficiency, symptoms are not observed from the lack of these products, as adequate levels of choline and amino acids are obtained from the diet 删除25：<u></u>.\n\n【26】删除3：<u>Figure 4-1. Structure of tetrahydrofolate, the active form of folic acid.</u>\n\n【27】Folate deficiency results in megaloblastic anemia. Megaloblastic anemia is characterized by macrocytic erythrocytes produced by abnormal proliferation of erythroid precursors in the bone marrow. Folate deficiency encumbers the maturation of these cells by inhibition of DNA synthesis. Without an adequate supply of folate, DNA synthesis is limited by decreased purine and dTMP levels.\n\n【28】Folate exists in a pool of interconvertible intermediates, each carrying a 1-carbon fragment in several different oxidation states . The total body stores of folate is approximately 110 mg/70 kg, and approximately 420 μg/70 kg is lost each day via the urine and feces. A total of 2 different forms of folate are required for different aspects of nucleotide biosynthesis.

THF can carry 1-carbon units in the oxidation states of methanol (N通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>5 </sup></u> \\-methyl THF), formaldehyde (N通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>5 </sup></u> , N通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>10 </sup></u> \\-methylene THF) or formic acid (remaining structures).</u>\n\n【30】The methylene form, N通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>5 </sup></u> , N通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>10 </sup></u> \\-methylene THF, is required for the production of dTMP from dUMP. This reaction involves the transfer of a CH <sub>2 </sub> group and a hydrogen from N通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>5 </sup></u> , N通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>10 </sup></u> \\-methylene THF. In this process, THF is oxidized to dihydrofolate (DHF). For subsequent dTMP production, THF must be regenerated. THF is produced from DHF by the enzyme DHF reductase (DHFR) in a reaction requiring NADPH. DHFR is the target of methotrexate, an antifolate cancer chemotherapeutic, which, by limiting the available pool of N通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>5 </sup></u> , N通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>10 </sup></u> \\-methylene THF inhibits DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cancer cells. Methotrexate therapy can produce adverse events resembling folate deficiency. In addition, bacterial DHFR is a target for antimicrobials.\n\n【31】Outside of DNA synthesis, folate plays a role in methylation metabolism. The major methyl donor is S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), which is required for many reactions. For example, SAM is needed for the production of norepinephrine from epinephrine and for DNA methylation, which can influence gene transcription. After methyl group transfer, SAM is converted to S-adenosyl homocysteine (SAH), which is hydrolyzed to homocysteine and adenosine. To restore the levels of methionine (an essential amino acid), homocysteine must be methylated . This reaction is dependent on N通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>5 </sup></u> \\-methyl THF and vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> . Methionine levels can be limiting, making the availability of N通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>5 </sup></u> \\-methyl THF for conversion of homocysteine to methionine critical. Further, in the absence of B <sub>12 </sub> , THF can be trapped in the N通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>5 </sup></u> \\-methyl THF form and thus be removed from the THF pool. This is referred to as the “methyl trap,” which can impact other areas of 1-carbon metabolism, such as dTMP production.\n\n【32】删除3：<u>Figure 4-3. Reaction pathways showing the interconversion of 1-carbon carriers of tetrahydrofolate (THF). Note that all interconversions are reversible, except for the conversion of N通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>5 </sup></u> , N通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>10 </sup></u> \\-methylene THF to N通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>5 </sup></u> \\-methyl THF.</u>\n\n【33】Folate deficiency perturbs DNA metabolism and methylation reactions. Leafy green vegetables are good sources of folate ; however, folate is labile and may be damaged during food preparation. Another dietary source of folate is cereal products, especially breads and breakfast cereals that have been fortified with folic acid. Folate is also produced within the gut lumen by certain intestinal bacteria; however, the amount of folate absorbed from this source is minor in humans. In its simplest form, folate consists of 3 connected chemical moieties: a pteridine ring (6-methylpterin), p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), and glutamate. In nature, folate is generally polyglutamated (decorated by two to seven additional glutamic acid residues). Conjugases (γ-glutamyl carboxypeptidases) in the intestinal lumen cleave off extra glutamic acid residue, and folate is absorbed by the mucosa of the small intestine . In cases of chronic alcoholism, folate deficiency may result from poor nutrition or from poor absorption of folate secondary to a conjugase deficiency. Once folate deficiency occurs, abnormal megaloblastic replication of epithelial mucosa can occur, which further impairs folate uptake.\n\n【34】删除3：<u>Figure 4-4. Intestinal absorption of dietary folates (THF-\\[Glu\\]n) and folic acid (F) from fortified cereal products and vitamin supplements. In the duodenum and upper jejunum, extra glutamate residue is cleaved by conjugases (γ-glutamyl carboxypeptidases). Both folate (F) and reduced folate (THF) are absorbed by a proton-coupled, high-affinity, folate transporter into the mucosal cell, converted to N通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>5 </sup></u> \\-methyl THF, and then exported into the portal circulation. N5-methyl THF is taken up into cells by facilitative diffusion, converted to THF by the B通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>12 </sup></u> \\-requiring methionine synthase, and then converted to a polyglutamate.</u>\n\n【35】After absorption, folate is reduced to THF by dihydrofolate reductase. The majority of circulating folate is in the form of N通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>5 </sup></u> \\-methyl THF. Cells use specific transporters for THF uptake, and cellular machinery polyglutamates the folate to aid in cellular retention.\n\n【36】In summary, folate is a vitamin acquired from the diet essential for 1-carbon metabolism. Inadequate folate levels inhibit DNA synthesis by limiting purine nucleotide and dTMP levels, which results in the abnormal cellular proliferation observed in megaloblastic anemia . Folate is also required to replenish the methionine pool for SAM-dependent methylation reactions.\n\n【37】###", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 14:02:36", "endTime": "2024/09/14 14:03:03", "cost": 27.468}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:02", "update_time": "2024-09-13 22:03:03", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 22:02:36"}

She often consumes two to three ice cream sundaes and four large sodas a day, but has still managed to maintain her weight. Friends often notice her using the bathroom more frequently but she denies any episodes of purging and states that she just has to urinate after drinking so much cola. On physical examination she is 5 ft 8 in and 110 lb and thyroid is nonpalpable. Which of the following test results is diagnostic of diabetes mellitus?\n\n【1】A. Single glucose of 150 mg/dL\n\n【2】B. A 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test greater than 200 mg/dL with a 100-g glucose load\n\n【3】C. A random glucose greater than 200 mg/dL with symptoms such as polydipsia or polyuria\n\n【4】D. A HbA <sub>1c </sub> of 6.3%\n\n【5】Answer: 51.1 C . Diabetes mellitus can be defined by measurement of an 8-hour fasting glucose more than 125 mg/dL; a random glucose of 200 mg/dL or more with classic symptoms or a 2-hour glucose tolerance test of 200 mg/dL or more after a 75-g glucose load. Recently the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommended that a HbA <sub>1c </sub> of ≥6.5% can be used for diagnosing diabetes.\n\n【6】Question: 51.2 A 7-year-old is brought to the office with symptoms of polydipsia, polyphagia, polyuria, and weight loss of 8 lb. For the past 24 hours he has had abdominal pain and vomiting. An urinalysis done in the office shows the presence of glucose and ketones. A finger-stick blood glucose is more than 500 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most appropriate management?\n\n【7】A. Prescription for oral metformin and referral to a nutritionist\n\n【8】B. Hospitalization with institution of insulin and IV fluids\n\n【9】C. Prescription for insulin to be started at home, with follow-up in 24 hours\n\n【10】D. Treatment for acute gastroenteritis and referral to an endocrinologist\n\n【11】Answer: 51.2 B . This is a typical presentation of diabetic ketoacidosis, a medical emergency. This is a common initial presentation of type 1 diabetes. This child requires immediate hospitalization, IV fluids, and insulin.\n\n【12】Question: 51.3 An 83-year-old man was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 3 months ago. He has altered his diet and tries to walk at least half a mile in the evenings. He drinks a glass of wine with lunch and dinner. For the past week he has felt dizzy upon standing and has fallen on two occasions, but he never lost consciousness. After the last episode he presented to the local ER where his blood pressure was found to be 155/76 mm Hg, HR 74 beats/min, and RR 16 breaths/min. A finger stick showed a glucose level of 84. Which of the following classes of medications has the lowest incidence of causing hypoglycemia when given as single-agent therapy?\n\n【13】A. Biguanide\n\n【14】B. Insulin\n\n【15】C. Sulfonylurea\n\n【16】D. Meglitinide\n\n【17】Answer: 51.3 A . Biguanides (metformin) are effective medications for the treatment of type 2 diabetes; they do not cause hypoglycemia when given as monotherapy. Insulin and insulin secretagogues carry a risk of hypoglycemia as a complication of therapy.\n\n【18】Question: 51.4 A 38-year-old G1P0 woman who is a new patient presents to the office at 10-week gestation. She is known to have type 2 diabetes. She currently takes metformin and her last HbA <sub>1c </sub> was 10.4%. Her urine dip is negative for ketones, protein, and leukocytes. She has no other medical problems and does not drink or smoke. On physical examination she is 5 ft 4 in and weighs 202 lb. She inquires about the risk to her fetus. As compared to gestational diabetes, this patient is at increased risk for which of the following?\n\n【19】A. Fetal malformations\n\n【20】B. Fetal macrosomia\n\n【21】C. Polyhydramnios\n\n【22】D. Shoulder dystocia\nAnswer: 51.4 A . Gestational diabetes is more likely to lead to fetal macrosomia and polyhydramnios. Both gestational and pregestational diabetes are associated with shoulder dystocia. Pregestational diabetes is associated with greater fetal malformations due to the higher serum glucose levels during organogenesis (5- to 10-week gestational age), whereas gestational diabetes tends to be associated with hyperglycemia after 20-week gestation, when the fetal organs have already formed. Preterm labor occurs at same frequency in diabetics as nondiabetics.\n\n【23】CLINICAL PEARLS\n\n【24】 Diabetes is one of the most common diseases in clinical practice. The criteria for diagnosis have been lowered to decrease complications, including death.\n\n【25】 Type 2 diabetes accounts for more than 90% of all diabetes in the United States. The increasing presence of obesity is, unfortunately, driving the incidence of type 2 diabetes even higher.\n\n【26】 Biguanides are gaining favor in the treatment of type 2 diabetes because of their potency and demonstrated reduction in morbidity and mortality.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 13:53:28", "endTime": "2024/09/14 13:53:45", "cost": 17.654}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:02", "update_time": "2024-09-13 21:53:45", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 21:53:27"}

The eyes, ears, sinuses, and throat can also be involved. Allergic rhinitis is the most common cause of rhinitis, occurring in up to 20% of the population.\n\n【13】#### Pathophysiology\n\n【14】Allergic rhinitis involves inflammation of the mucous membranes of the nose, eyes, eustachian tubes, middle ear, sinuses, and pharynx. Inflammation of the mucous membranes is characterized by a complex interaction of inflammatory mediators but, ultimately, is triggered by an IgE-mediated response to an extrinsic protein.\n\n【15】In susceptible individuals, exposure to certain foreign proteins leads to allergic sensitization, which is characterized by the production of specific IgE directed against these proteins. This specific IgE coats the surface of mast cells, which are present in the nasal mucosa. When the specific allergen is inhaled into the nose, it can bind to the IgE in the mast cells, leading to the delayed release of a number of mediators.\n\n【16】Mediators that are immediately released include histamine, tryptase, chymase, and kinase. Mast cells quickly synthesize other mediators, including leukotrienes and prostaglandin D <sub>2 </sub> . Symptoms can occur quickly after exposure. Mucous glands are stimulated, leading to increased secretions. Vasodilation occurs, causing congestion. Stimulation of sensory nerves leads to sneezing and itching. Other symptoms include the redness and tearing of eyes, postnasal drip, and ear pressure.\n\n【17】Over the next 4 to 8 hours, these mediators, through a complex interplay of events, recruit neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages to the mucosa. These inflammatory cells cause more congestion and mucus production that may persist for hours or days. Systemic effects, including fatigue, sleepiness, and malaise, can result from the inflammatory response as well.\n\n【18】#### History\n\n【19】Obtaining a detailed history is important in the evaluation of allergic rhinitis, as specific triggers may be identified. Evaluation should include the nature, duration, and time course of symptoms. The recent use of medications is another important consideration as are a family history of allergic diseases, environmental exposures, and comorbid conditions.\n\n【20】Part of the history should include the time pattern of symptoms and whether symptoms occur at a consistent level throughout the year ( perennial rhinitis ), only occur in specific seasons ( seasonal rhinitis ), a combination of the two, or in relation to a workplace ( occupational rhinitis ). Trigger factors such as exposure to pollens, mold spores, specific animals, or cleaning of the house can sometimes be identified. Irritant triggers such as smoke, pollution, and strong smells can aggravate symptoms of allergic rhinitis. Response to treatment with antihistamines supports the diagnosis of allergic rhinitis.\n\n【21】#### Symptoms\n\n【22】Symptoms that can be associated with allergic rhinitis include sneezing, itching (of nose, eyes, or ears), rhinorrhea, postnasal drip, congestion, anosmia, headache, earache, tearing, red eyes, and drowsiness.\n\n【23】#### Physical Examination\n\n【24】Common findings on examination include “allergic shiners,” which are dark circles around the eyes related to vasodilation or nasal congestion. The “nasal crease” can be seen in some cases. It is a horizontal crease across the lower half of the bridge of the nose caused by repeated upward rubbing of the tip of the nose by the palm of the hand (“allergic salute”).\n\n【25】Examination of the nose may reveal mucosa of the nasal turbinates to be swollen (boggy) and have a pale, bluish-gray color. Assessment of the character and quantity of nasal mucus may be helpful in ascertaining a diagnosis. Thin and watery secretions are frequently associated with allergic rhinitis, whereas thick and purulent secretions are usually associated with sinusitis. The characteristic of the mucous is not always diagnostic, as thick, purulent, colored mucus can also occur with allergic rhinitis.\n\n【26】The nasal cavity should be inspected for growths such as polyps or tumors. Polyps are firm, gray masses that are often attached by a stalk, which may not be visible. After spraying a topical decongestant, polyps do not shrink, whereas the surrounding nasal mucosa does shrink. Examine the nasal septum to look for any deviation or septal perforation that may be present as a consequence of chronic rhinitis, granulomatous disease, cocaine abuse, prior surgery, topical decongestant abuse, or, rarely, topical steroid overuse.\n\n【27】Otoscopy should be performed to look for tympanic membrane retraction, air-fluid levels, or bubbles. Performing pneumatic otoscopy can be considered to look for abnormal tympanic membrane mobility. These findings can be associated with allergic rhinitis, particularly if eustachian tube dysfunction or secondary otitis media is present. Ocular examination may reveal findings of injection and swelling of the palpebral conjunctivae, with excess tear production. Dennie-Morgan lines (prominent creases below the inferior eyelid) are associated with allergic rhinitis.\n\n【28】“Cobblestoning” of the posterior pharynx is often observed. This is caused by the presence of streaks of lymphoid tissue on the posterior pharynx. Tonsillar hypertrophy can also be seen. The neck should be examined for the presence of lymph-adenopathy. The respiratory system must be examined for findings consistent with asthma. These include wheezing, tachypnea, and a prolonged expiratory phase of respiration.\n\n【29】### CAUSES OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS\n\n【30】The causes of allergic rhinitis can differ depending on whether the symptoms are seasonal, perennial, or sporadic/episodic. Some patients are sensitive to multiple allergens and can have perennial allergic rhinitis with seasonal exacerbations. Although food allergy can cause rhinitis, particularly in children, it is rarely a cause of allergic rhinitis in the absence of gastrointestinal or skin symptoms. Seasonal allergic rhinitis is commonly caused by allergy to seasonal pollens and outdoor molds.\n\n【31】#### Pollens (Tree, Grass, and Weed)\n\n【32】Tree pollens, which vary by geographic location, are typically present in high counts during the spring, although some species produce their pollens in the fall. Grass pollens also vary by geographic location. Most of the common grass species are associated with allergic rhinitis. A number of these grasses are cross-reactive, meaning that they have similar antigenic structures (ie, proteins recognized by specific IgE in allergic sensitization). Consequently, a person who is allergic to one species is also likely to be sensitive to a number of other species. The grass pollens are most prominent from the late spring through the fall, but can be present year-round in warmer climates.\n\n【33】Weed pollens also vary geographically. Many weeds, such as short ragweed, a common cause of allergic rhinitis in much of the United States, are most prominent in the late summer and fall. Other weed pollens are present year-round, particularly in warmer climates.\n\n【34】Perennial allergic rhinitis is typically caused by allergens within the home, but can also be caused by outdoor allergens that are present year-round. In warmer climates, grass pollens can be present throughout the year. In some climates, individuals may be symptomatic because of trees and grasses in the warmer months and molds and weeds in the winter.\n\n【35】#### House Dust Mites\n\n【36】In the United States, two major house dust mite species are associated with allergic rhinitis. These mites feed on organic material in households, particularly the skin that is shed from humans and pets. They can be found in carpets, upholstered furniture, pillows, mattresses, comforters, and stuffed toys. Exposure can be reduced by methods such as carpet removal; however, current studies have not found any benefit to using mite-proof mattresses or pillow covers.\n\n【37】#### Animals\n\n【38】Allergy to indoor pets is a common cause of perennial allergic rhinitis. Cat and dog allergies are encountered most commonly in clinical practice. However, allergies have been reported to occur with most of the furry animals and birds that are kept as indoor pets. Although cockroach allergy is most frequently considered to be a cause of asthma, particularly in the inner city, it can also cause perennial allergic rhinitis in infested households. Rodent infestation may also be associated with allergic sensitization.\n\n【39】### TREATMENT\n\n【40】The management of allergic rhinitis consists of four major categories of treatment: patient education, allergen avoidance, pharmacologic management, and immuno-therapy. All aspects of treatment are more successful when exposure to allergens is decreased.\n\n【41】Recommendations for treatment are primarily based on symptoms and patient age. Pharmacotherapy can involve the use of antihistamines, decongestants, intra-nasal corticosteroids, and, in severe cases, systemic corticosteroids. Antihista-mines competitively antagonize the receptors for histamine, which is released from mast cells. This reduces the production of symptoms mediated by the release of histamine. “First-generation” antihistamines including diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine, and hydroxyzine are inexpensive and available over the counter. Side effects include sedation and the anticholinergic effects of dry mouth, dry eyes, blurred vision, and urinary retention; therefore, their use should be monitored in sensitive populations, such as the elderly. Newer, so-called second-generation antihistamines, including loratadine, desloratadine, fexofenadine, and cetirizine, have much less penetration into the central nervous system, resulting in a lower incidence of sedation as a side effect (except for cetirizine). They also have fewer anticholinergic effects. They are, however, significantly more expensive than the older agents. Loratadine, fexofenadine and cetirizine have recently become available without a prescription. Oral antihistamines begin to take effect within 15 to 30 minutes after ingestion and are best used in persons with mild and intermittent symptoms.\n\n【42】Decongestants , either given orally or intranasally, can be used to provide symptomatic relief of nasal congestion. These agents constrict blood vessels in the nasal mucosa and reduce the overall volume of the mucosa. The most commonly used agent is pseudoephedrine, an α-adrenoreceptor agonist. Oral decongestants can cause tachycardia, tremors, and insomnia. Rebound hyperemia and worsening of symptoms can occur with chronic use or upon discontinuation of nasal decongestants.\n\n【43】Corticosteroid nasal sprays are the most effective treatment and first-line therapy for the long-term management of mild to moderate persistent symptoms of allergic rhinitis. They reduce the production of inflammatory mediators and the recruitment of inflammatory cells. Systemic absorption of the steroid is relatively low, reducing the risk of complications associated with the chronic use of systemic corticosteroids. Side effects include nosebleeds, pharyngitis, and upper respiratory tract infections. Maximal effectiveness is achieved after 2 to 4 weeks of use.\n\n【44】Leukotriene inhibitors (zafirlukast, montelukast, zileuton) are indicated both for allergic rhinitis and for maintenance therapy for persistent asthma. They are particularly useful in patients with both asthma and allergies or in those whose asthma may be triggered by allergens. Although useful, they have not been proven to be superior to corticosteroid nasal sprays alone. Leukotriene inhibitors are taken orally and are only available by prescription.\n\n【45】Oral corticosteroids are potent inhibitors of cell-mediated immunity. The use of systemic steroids is limited by adverse effects, including suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and hyperglycemia. Long-term use can lead to peptic ulcer formation, increased susceptibility to infection, poor wound healing, and the reduction of bone density. Because of these significant risks, systemic steroids are used only for severe allergies and are used in the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible time.\n\n【46】Desensitization therapy is frequently attempted in patients who remain symptomatic despite maximal medical therapy. The first step of this treatment is to test for specific antigens to which the person is allergic. The second step is to inject the patient with highly diluted concentrations of this antigen. The concentration of the antigen(s) in the injection is gradually increased, in an effort to reduce the patient’s inflammatory response to the antigen(s). Injections are typically given weekly or biweekly. This process is expensive, time-consuming, and requires numerous injections. Patients and physicians must be prepared to address severe, even anaphylactic, reactions that may occur during the process.\n\n【47】### ANAPHYLAXIS, URTICARIA, AND ANGIOEDEMA\n\n【48】Urticaria is characterized by large, irregularly shaped, pruritic, erythematous wheals. Angioedema is painless, deep, subcutaneous swelling that often involves the periorbital, circumoral, and facial regions. Anaphylaxis is a systemic reaction with cutaneous symptoms that is associated with dyspnea, visceral edema, and hypotension. The manifestations of anaphylaxis include hypotension or shock from widespread vaso-dilation, respiratory distress from bronchospasm or laryngeal edema, gastrointestinal and uterine muscle contraction, and urticaria and angioedema.\n\n【49】At the first suspicion of anaphylaxis, aqueous epinephrine 1:1000, in a dose of 0.2 to 0.5 mL (0.2-0.5 mg) is injected subcutaneously or intramuscularly . Repeated injections can be given every 15 to 30 minutes when necessary. Rapid intravenous infusion of large volumes of fluids (saline, lactated Ringer solution, plasma or plasma expanders) is essential to replace loss of intravascular plasma into tissues. Airway obstruction may be caused by edema of the larynx or by bronchospasm. Endotracheal intubation may be required. Bronchospasm responds to subcutaneous epinephrine or terbutaline. Antihistamines may be useful as adjuvant therapy for alleviating cutaneous manifestations of urticaria or angioedema and pruritus. All patients with anaphylaxis should be monitored for a period of time, for example, 24 hours.\n\n【50】### CONJUNCTIVITIS\n\n【51】Conjunctivitis is an infection of the palpebral and/or bulbar conjunctiva. It is the most common eye disease seen in community medicine. Most cases are caused by bacterial or viral infection. Other causes include allergy and chemical irritants. The mode of transmission of infectious conjunctivitis is usually direct contact to the opposite eye or to other persons via fingers, towels, or handkerchiefs.\n\n【52】The organisms isolated most commonly in bacterial conjunctivitis are Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Haemophilus, Moraxella , and Pseudomonas . There is no blurring of vision and only mild discomfort. In severe cases, examination of stained conjunctival scrapings and cultures are recommended. The disease is usually self-limited, lasting about 10 to 14 days if untreated. A sulfonamide instilled locally three times daily will usually clear the infection in 2 to 3 days.\n\n【53】Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (pink eye) is highly contagious and spread by person-to-person contact or fomites. The most common cause is adenovirus. It is usually associated with pharyngitis, fever, malaise, and preauricular lymphadenopathy. Locally, the palpebral conjunctiva is red with a copious watery discharge and scanty exudates. Local sulfonamide therapy might prevent secondary bacterial infection; hot compresses reduce the discomfort of the associated lid edema; weak topical steroids may be necessary to treat the corneal infiltrates. The disease usually lasts at least 2 weeks.\n\n【54】Noninfectious causes of conjunctivitis include allergic and chemical irritants. Symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis include itching, tearing, redness, stringy discharge, and sometimes photophobia. Treatment can include the use of oral antihistamines or topical antihistamine or anti-inflammatory eye drops.\n\n【55】###", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:30:44", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:31:09", "cost": 24.226}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:02", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:31:06", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:30:42"}

The lymphoma is typically composed of T-lymphocytes and often presents at later stages with systemic symptoms such as early satiety, fatigue, or night sweats. The cause of anap­lastic large cell lymphoma is unclear 删除10：<u>(Stein et al. 2000 ; Swerdlow et al. 2008 )</u>.\n\n【25】In this case study, Stage II designates that the affected groups of lymph nodes are confined to only one side of the diaphragm. The letter “E” further classifies the lymphoma as extranodal, since it presented only on the skin.\n\n【26】Typically, patients suffering from anaplastic large cell lymphoma first notice a painless area of inflammation located in the neck, armpit or groin. The lymphoma can affect other organs such as the skin, lungs, liver, and bone marrow. Multiple groups of nodes are typically involved.\n\n【27】A diagnosis is made by performing a biopsy on an enlarged lymph node. If the patient displays a primary cutaneous form, as this patient did, a skin biopsy with immunohistochemical staining is diagnostic 删除10：<u>(Bartlett et al. 2008 )</u>. Further tests, including blood work, x-rays, and bone marrow specimens may be needed for appropriate staging.\n\n【28】Metastatic carcinoma can resemble anaplastic large cell lymphoma due to the fact that it can display the same type of hallmark cells and growth patterns. The absence of cytokeratin marker militates for anaplastic large cell lymphoma. B-cell lymphoma can be ruled out if the cells test negative for markers of B-cell lineage. These additional tests may be required due to the fact that B-cell lymphomas and rhabdomyosarcomas may test positive for the anaplastic lymphoma kinase protein 删除10：<u>(Chiarle et al. 2008 )</u>. However, B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas are much less commonly associated with skin involvement than are the T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas.\n\n【29】Treatment of anaplastic large cell lymphoma typically involves the use of intensive chemotherapy. Treatment response is often predictable by ALK immunohistochemical staining. ALK-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma is rarely cured with chemotherapy where ALK positive tumors have a better prognosis. According to a study by Savage et al. on 181 patients, the 5 year overall survival rate for ALK-positive ALCL was approximately 70 %, compared to 49 % for ALK-negative ALCL. However, this study also showed no difference in outcome in patients less than 40 years of age, suggesting that age may be an important prognostic factor in deciding patient outcome 删除10：<u>(Savage et al. 2008 )</u>.\n\n【30】New treatments, currently under investigation and review, include medications with anti-CD30 monoclonal antibodies that may be advantageous in destroying ALK-negative tumor cells. Also, ALK-kinase inhibitors may provide a different outlook for treating ALK-positive tumors in the future 删除10：<u>(Li et al. 2008 ; McDermott et al. 2008 )</u>.\n\n【31】Key Points\n----------\n\n【32】   Anaplastic large cell lymphoma is a rare form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).\n\n【33】   ALK immunohistochemical staining might be helpful in predicting chemotherapeutic response.\n\n【34】   Lymphomas can affect other organs such as the skin, lungs, liver, and bone marrow.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:37:14", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:38:38", "cost": 84.195}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:02", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:38:37", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:37:12"}

The patient said that he immediately heard a “popping” sound. The player started to complain of stiffness and swelling in his knee, which he felt was “giving out.” He was carted off the field by emergency medical services (EMS), and on examination, he had an unstable gait and lost full range of motion in his right knee. His knee was tender to palpation. He has no past medical history and is otherwise healthy.\n\n【3】 What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【4】 What knee structures are most likely injured?\n\n【5】 What skeletal and muscular components are involved in the injury?\n\n【6】### ANSWER TO CASE 55 :\n\n【7】#### Knee Injury\n\n【8】Summary: A 19-year-old male with no past medical history is tackled during a football game and is complaining of pain in his right knee after hearing a “popping sound.” His gait is unstable and he has instability in his knee with twisting motion. In addition, he has lost his full range of motion.\n\n【9】• Most likely diagnosis: Injury to unhappy triad (“O’Donoghue’s triad”, “terrible triad”).\n\n【10】• Knee structures likely injured: Anterior cruciate ligament, medial collateral ligament, and medial meniscus.\n\n【11】• Skeletal components involved: Patella, femur, and tibia. There are no muscles directly involved with this type of injury.\n\n【12】### CLINICAL CORRELATION\n\n【13】The unhappy triad consists of damage to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), medial collateral ligament (MCL), and medial meniscus and is common among sports injuries when a player is tackled with great force such as in football, rugby, or soccer.\n\n【14】This athlete was playing in a football game and was otherwise healthy. He was clipped perpendicularly from the lateral aspect of the knee such that the force was directed from lateral to medial, thereby straining the MCL and medial meniscus. Along with this, the sudden inward twisting of the knee with the foot planted causes a strain on the ACL. Hearing a popping sound is a very common symptom with injury to the ACL. The patient’s unstable gait and instability in twisting motion from side to side further confirm the suspicion that he damaged ligaments in the unhappy triad. Other common symptoms are pain and swelling in the knee immediately after injury.\n\n【15】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【16】#### The Knee Joint\n\n【17】### OBJECTIVES\n\n【18】1\\. Be able to describe the anatomy of the knee joint, including the articular surface, joint capsule, ligaments, and menisci\n\n【19】2\\. Be able to describe the various mechanisms of injury to the knee joint\n\n【20】### DEFINITIONS\n\n【21】MENISCUS: A crescentlike fibrocartilaginous structure located in the knee joint between the condyles of the tibia and femur bones. The medial meniscus (C-shaped) and lateral meniscus (O-shaped) act as cartilaginous pads to absorb shock, fit the articular surfaces better, and increase the flexibility of the knee joint.\n\n【22】LATERAL MENISCUS: A smaller structure, separated from the lateral collateral ligament by the tendon of the popliteus muscle. It is more freely mobile than the medial meniscus.\n\n【23】### DISCUSSION\n\n【24】The knee joint is the largest and most complex synovial joint in the body. It is formed by the femur bone, tibia bone, and patella. The fibula bone is not a part of the knee joint .\n\n【25】删除3：<u>Figure 55-1. Anterior view of the right knee. ( Reproduced, with permission, from Lindner HH . Clinical Anatomy. East Norwalk, CT: Appleton & Lange, 1989:615 .)</u>\n\n【26】#### Articular Surfaces\n\n【27】The lateral and medial femoral condyles join with the lateral and medial tibial condyles to form the femorotibial articulations. The patella surface of the femur bone joins with the largest sesamoid bone the patella to form the femoropatellar articulation. The articular surfaces do not fit perfectly with each other.\n\n【28】#### Articular Capsule and Cavity\n\n【29】The fibrous capsule is a thin but strong membrane that attaches to the articular margins of the condyles of the femur and tibia, and the fibrous capsule is fused with the patellar ligament anteriorly. The synovial capsule lines the inner surface of the fibrous capsule, and it reflects on the interior between the tibia and femur bones to form the synovial folds, like the infrapatellar fold, alar fold, and similar structures. Between the muscles and the tendons that surround the knee, the synovial capsule projects exteriorly through a break in the fibrous capsule to form the synovial bursae, such as the suprapatella and infrapatellar bursae. Bursae are an extension of the articular cavity and can reduce friction when the muscle or tendon moves on the surface of the knee.\n\n【30】The articular cavity is the space between the articular surfaces and the articular capsule. In the knee joint, the articular cavity is relatively narrow, which contributes to the joint’s stability.\n\n【31】#### Ligaments\n\n【32】There are two groups of ligaments to strengthen the knee joint: the extracapsular ligaments and intraarticular ligaments :\n\n【33】删除3：<u>Figure 55-2. The fully flexed right knee, showing ligaments of the knee joint. 删除10：<u>( Reproduced , with permission, from Lindner HH. Clinical Anatomy. East Norwalk, CT: Appleton & Lange , 1989:615.)</u></u>\n\n【34】1\\. Extra capsular ligaments (external ligaments) are located on the external surface of the joint capsule:\n\n【35】A. Patellar ligament: the inferior part (below the patella) of the quadriceps tendon. It is the strongest ligament of the knee joint and protects the joint from the anterior aspect.\n\n【36】B. Lateral collateral ligament: a cordlike, strong ligament that extends from the lateral epicondyle of the femur to the lateral surface of the fibula and is separated from the lateral meniscus by the tendon of popliteus muscle. The lateral collateral ligament prevents adduction of the knee joint.\n\n【37】C. Medial collateral ligament: a flat, bandlike ligament that extends from the medial epicondyle of the femur to the medial surface of the tibia. Deep fibers of this ligament firmly attach to the medial meniscus; thus, the ligament is often damaged together with the medial meniscus. Both of the collateral ligaments strengthen the knee joint on the sides. The medial collateral ligament prevents abduction of the knee joint.\n\n【38】D. Oblique popliteal ligament: the posterior ligament of the knee that extends superiorly and laterally from the medial epicondyle of the tibia to the posterior surface of the joint capsule. It strengthens the capsule of knee joint posteriorly.\n\n【39】E. Arcuate popliteal ligament: a small ligament that extends from the posterior surface of the fibular head and crosses the tendon of the popliteus to the posterior surface of the capsule. Just like the oblique popliteal ligament, it strengthens the capsule of knee joint posteriorly.\n\n【40】2\\. Intraarticular ligaments (internal ligaments)\n\n【41】A. Cruciate ligaments: two ligaments located in the middle of the joint that cross each other forming what looks like the letter “X”. The anterior cruciate ligament connects the tibia (anterior to the intercondylar eminence) to the medial surface of the lateral condyle of the femur. The posterior cruciate ligament connects the tibia (posterior to the intercondylar eminence) to the lateral surface of the medial condyle of the femur. The cruciate ligaments prevent the tibia from sliding anteriorly and posteriorly on the femur, providing stability to the knee joint. In addition to the cruciate ligaments, there are other small ligaments in the knee joint, such as the transverse ligament, which are functionally less important to the joint.\n\n【42】#### Movement of the Knee Joint\n\n【43】Two menisci are located between the femur and the tibia and contribute to the flexibility of the knee joint .\n\n【44】删除3：<u>Figure 55-3. Superior aspect of the right tibia showing menisci of the knee joint. \\[ Reproduced , with permission, from Lindner HH. Clinical Anatomy. East Norwalk, CT: Appleton & Lange, 1989:563.\\]</u>\n\n【45】The knee joint is a hinge-type joint that permits flexion and extension. When the joint is flexed, the round posterior surface of the medial and lateral condyles of the femur contact the condyles of the tibia and permit slight medial and lateral rotation.\n\n【46】The knee joint is mainly supplied by five genicular arteries that originate from the popliteal artery. The superior medial genicular, superior lateral genicular, inferior medial genicular, and inferior lateral genicular arteries form the genicular anastomosis around the knee (between the muscles and the bones), and the middle genicular artery crosses the posterior capsule to supply the interior structures of the knee.\n\n【47】During sports and other high-contact activities, the knee joint can often be subjected to abnormal forces from the anterior and lateral directions, causing tears of the anterior cruciate ligament. Forced abduction of the knee joint can tear the medial collateral ligament, and because the medial collateral ligament is firmly attached to the medial meniscus (especially with the limited movement between the femur and tibia bones), the medial meniscus is commonly injured with the medial collateral ligament. The anterior cruciate ligament, medial collateral ligament, and medial meniscus are frequently damaged simultaneously; this event is commonly known as the “unhappy triad of the knee.”\n\n【48】###", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:08:51", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:10:35", "cost": 103.878}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:02", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:10:32", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:08:48"}

Describe the characteristics of patients that present with lichen sclerosis， and the natural history of the disease.\n\n【13】2\\. Recognize the anatomical boundaries of the vulva and aspects of good vulvar hygiene.\n\n【14】3\\. Identify current treatment regimes for lichen sclerosis and the follow-up that is requisite.\n\n【15】4\\. Describe some of the other common vulvar diseases and their treatment.\n\n【16】Considerations\n\n【17】This postmenopausal woman is suffering from lichen sclerosis given her history and physical finding. The diagnosis is confirmed with biopsy of the affected vulvar tissue， revealing a thinned epidermis， hyperkeratosis， and elongation of the rete1S CA pegs. Lichen planus can also present similarly， but usually involves the vagina which LS does not. An experienced dermatopathologist should be able to differentiate the two on biopsy specimen. Long-standing candidal infection of the vulva may lead to similar symptoms. Since our patient is postmenopausal， therefore lacking estrogen， the pH of the area is raised and not amenable to candidal infection unless she has poorly controlled diabetes or is immunosuppressed. Sometimes vaginal atrophy in the postmenopausal patient can lead to pruritus， but usually not to this extent. Psoriasis may present with pruritus but not usually， and the lesions are clas-sically described as silver scales， and are also present on the extensor surfaces of the extremities. Cancer of the vulva or vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia commonly presents with pruritus and is often associated with LS， which is why biopsy of the affected area and frequent surveillance of the vulva is warranted.\n\n【18】APPROACHTO：Vulvar Disorders\n\n【19】DEFINITIONS\n\n【20】LICHEN SCLEROSIS： Chronic， inflammatory dermatologic disease characterized by pruritus and pain， which mainly affects the anogenital region.\n\n【21】VULVA： The external genitalia of the female comprised of the mons pubis， the labia majora and minora， the clitoris， the vestibule of the vagina and its glands， and the opening of the urethra and of the vagina.\n\n【22】CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【23】The anatomic boundaries of the vulva extend from the mons pubis superiorly to the anus inferiorly and the genitocrural folds laterally. It is made up of the labia majora and minora， mons pubis， clitoris， vestibule of the vagina， urethral meatus， Skene glands， vaginal orifice， hymen， and Bartholin glands.\n\n【24】Lichen Sclerosis\n\n【25】Lichen sclerosis is a chronic progressive inflammatory medical condition of which there is no definitive cure. LS is more common in women than men， and the onset can occur at any age， peaking in the prepubertal and postmenopausal period. LS usually presents in the anogenital region， with extragenital disease only15% to 20%of the time. Women with the disease usually present with the complaint of itch-ing which can be worse at night， and is described by the patient as vaginal itching. Appreciate that the itching is localized to the tissue of the vulva. Differential diag-nosis of LS is lichen planus， psoriasis， vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia， and vitiligo. On examination of the external genitalia， a figure-eight pattern is seen around the vulva and anus. The skin is classically described as \"tigarette paper\"as it appears crin-kled and is fragile， thinned， and atrophic. Abrasions may develop from scratching or attempted intercourse， and ultimately scarring may cause narrowing or a complete closure of the vaginal introitus， even in the parous woman. The labia minora may fuse burying the clitoris behind the fused clitoral hood. The scratching of the areas worsens the disease and can also lead to dyschezia， from constriction of the anus.\n\n【26】Counseling of the patient is important including discussing components of vul-var hygiene， avoiding irritants to the skin such as soaps and bubble baths， cessa-tion of scratching the lesions， and wearing all cotton， white underwear. The patient should be made aware of the chronicity of the disease and the need for yearly surveillance. Treatment of the disease is aimed at preventing relapses of intense pruritus and the mainstay is corticosteroids. Initially， a potent steroid ointment， Clobetasol， may be necessary to provide relief， and should be used daily until symp-toms abate and then tapered to intermittent use.\n\n【27】Bartholin Gland Abscess\n\n【28】The Bartholin or greater vestibular glands are located at the 5- and 7-oclock locations of the labia majora. Usually， they are too small to palpate but with 删除换行1: inflammation， they can be enlarged and painful. The treatment options include incision and placement of a small balloon catheter into the gland or marsupializa-tion which is surgical fixation of the cyst wall everted against the mucosa of the vulva.The purpose of both of these techniques is to allow drainage of the infection for several weeks. A simple incision and drainage is prone to recurrence. Bartho-lin gland infections are usually polymicrobial and not usually sexually transmitted. Involvement in women over the age of 40 years can be associated with cancer and should have a biopsy.\n\n【29】Vulvar Cancer\n\n【30】Because vulvar cancer can present with no symptoms or with itching， any suspicious lesion of the vulva especially in a postmenopausal woman should undergo biopsy. Unfortunately， delay in diagnosis is usually the rule due to lack of clinical suspicion and prescription of various topical agents. Younger women such as those in their30s may develop vulvar cancer due to human papillomavirus； smoking is also a risk factor. Again， biopsy is the rule. Regardless of the age， if vulvar cancer is diagnosed， then the patient should have surgical staging， with the primary lesion removed and the adjacent (ipsilateral) inguinal lymph nodes. Most vulvar cancers are squamous cell， but melanoma， basal cell carcinoma， and other subtypes can occur. Thus，pig-mented lesions of the vulva should be carefully considered for biopsy.\n删除16：<u>CASE CORRELATION\n删除25：<u>See also Case 39 (Syphilitic Chancre) as a differential diagnosis of vulvar lesions， and also Case 57 (Endometrial Cancer)， Case 58 (Cervical Cancer)， and Case 59 (Ovarian Cancer) to see the differences in risk factors，presenta-tion， and treatment.</u>\n</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 13:43:47", "endTime": "2024/09/14 13:45:37", "cost": 110.765}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:02", "update_time": "2024-09-13 21:45:37", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 21:43:46"}

Patients with congenital albinism have problems producing melanin. This can be due to a deficiency in the tyrosine (precursor to melanin) transporters or a deficiency in the tyrosinase enzyme. Either way, patients will have generalized decreased pigmentation in the skin, eyes, and hair. Without aggressive photoprotection, most albinism patients will eventually develop skin cancer. The other major problems are ocular, as the lack of melanin causes poor development of the retinal pigment epithelium. The lack of pigment in the iris also causes problems. Nystagmus, strabismus, and impaired visual acuity are a few of the many ophthalmologic problems such patients can have.  \n\n【7】Answer A is incorrect.

It causes fatal infection of the central nervous system that has acute phase infection and rapid progression. This condition arises when the organism, Naegleria fowleri , is accidentally introduced via nasal route. Through the cribriform plate, amoeba enters the central nervous system and advances along the cribriform plate, following the olfactory nerve. Naegleria fowleri is a thermophile, free-living amoeba; there are over 40 species of Naegleria , but only Naegleria fowleri infection results in primary amoebic meningoencephalitis. The incubation period varies anywhere from 2 to 15 days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 – 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】In most cases, death happens around 3 to 7 days from the onset of symptoms. Naegleria fowleri , upon entering the central nervous system, causes cerebral edema, necrosis, and herniation. The infection of Naegleria fowleri resembles that of acute bacterial meningitis. The mortality rate is above 95%, with the highest number of cases occurring in developed countries because cases occurring in developing countries go primarily undiagnosed. The signs and symptoms of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis present in two stages, mild and severe. The risk factors for primary amoebic meningoencephalitis are 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> geographic location, i.e. areas that have been diagnosed, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> summer seasons, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> sex. Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis has been promulgated widely around the globe, including America, Australia, Thailand, Hong Kong, and Taiwan; about 300 cases in total have been reported so far in 50 years, since it was first identified. Because of the limited availability of diagnostic testing and clinical expertise, the signs and symptoms of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis were misinterpreted as common neurological infections such as bacterial and viral encephalitis . It is often misdiagnosed, as there is no definitive variation in diagnosis that exists to discriminate primary amoebic meningoencephalitis from bacterial meningoencephalitis. About <0.5% of diagnosed encephalitis deaths in the United States are because of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis. There are about 0–8 cases per year that are laboratory confirmed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. So far, there were about 151 confirmed primary amoebic meningoencephalitis cases from 1962 to 2020, with only 4 known survivors. These infections are more prominent in 15 southern tier states of the United States, of which more than half of the infections are concentrated in Texas and Florida 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. About 1676 cases of undetermined neuroinfectious disease deaths are within 2–22 years of age during 1999–2010 in which 49% (826/1676) happened in the months of July to September of each year, of which 23% (192/826) were reported in an included state of the southern United States. Of which, 52% (100/192) were male, and 48% (92/192) were female. Of the unspecified neuroinfectious deaths, an average of 16 (8 males and 8 females) suit the typical primary amoebic meningoencephalitis pattern of infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】Apart from Antarctica, Naegleria fowleri was spotted in all the corners of the world. Among identified 381 global primary amoebic meningoencephalitis cases, this is believed to be an underestimation of the actual occurrence of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis cases worldwide. An approximation of about 16 cases per year in the United States has been estimated in a previous study, of which only 0–8 cases are reported annually. The most favorable period for primary amoebic meningoencephalitis infections is the summer months, i.e. July, August, and September, during which the water temperatures are high and water levels are low. In an environmental investigation of lakes and rivers where the patients swam, high water temperature, algal bloom, and poor water clarity have been recorded, and samples taken from this area were positive for Naegleria fowleri . In India, only 15 cases of amoebic encephalitis have been identified. Worldwide data estimates that around 133 cases were reported from 1992 to 2014, out of which 10 were from India; about 97% of the victims died because of infection resulting in very few survivors. Of the identified 381 cases of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis from 1965 to 2016, 32 survived, and only 7 were laboratory-confirmed cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 – 9 \\]</u>. Of all those suffering from primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, most were previously healthy young males exposed to warm recreational water more commonly in lakes, ponds, and reservoirs in southern states of the United States during summer months. Differing from other free-living amoeba like Acanthamoeba and Balamuthia that affects the individuals who are immunocompromised, most of the Naegleria fowleri infections were present in young and immunocompetent individuals. However, in a place with high temperature like Africa, only less than ten cases of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis have been recorded . Even though Naegleria fowleri is a thermophilic organism, cases have also been identified in northern states of the United States, such as Kansas and Indiana; this change in existence and epidemiology of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis would indicate climate change. The change in geography, i.e. the reported cases outside of southern tier states, has raised concern and debates that regardless of its geography, primary amoebic meningoencephalitis should be made as a differential for meningitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 10 \\]</u> .\n\n【25】A pie chart with 20 sections titled P A M state of exposure in the United States between 1962 and 2020.

The patient had a severe frontal headache, neck stiffness, intermittent fever with body pain, nausea, vomiting, and left hemiplegia. On reviewing the patient’s history, it was known that he was a farmer with a history of opium use for the past 3 years and no significant medical history. On further investigation, it was found that the patient had a habit of taking bath in the village pond. The patient had an episode of syncopal attack 2 months back but regained consciousness after a while. There was significant weight loss in the last 2 months . As per the patient’s medical notes, he was complaining of sudden onset of left arm and leg weakness. A week before admission, the patient was conscious, was responsive to command, and had a regular appetite. At first, he was admitted to a private nursing home, where his condition started to deteriorate; he started losing his sensorium and stopped responding to commands. There he had two episodes of seizures, but it was controlled with the help of medication. On physical examination, the patient’s temperature was 102 F, blood pressure 130/80 mmHg, and pulse rate of 88 and deeply comatose . The patient’s pupils were constricted, and no papilledema was present. Computed tomography scan was done after the lumbar puncture procedure; cerebrospinal fluid was slightly turbid, collected in a sterile vial and sent to the laboratory for investigation.\n\n【30】On a computed tomography scan, it was revealed that there was a hypodensity in the brain stem up to the hypothalamus without any enhancement. The fourth ventricle was normal; in the right parasellar region, sphenoid sinus, and prepontine cistern, a soft tissue density was seen with evidence of erosion in the lateral wall of sella and adjacent portion of the greater wing of sphenoid, with soft tissue mass touching the basilar artery. The patient was diagnosed with a fungal infection of sphenoid sinus involvement and brain stem infarct. On laboratory data a total leukocyte count was 6800/mm <sup>3 </sup> including 69% neutrophils, 25% lymphocytes, 2% eosinophils, and 4% monocytes, platelets were 210 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 21 mm/h. The patient’s hemoglobin concentration was 12.5 g/dl. Peripheral blood film was negative for malarial parasites. A rapid test was negative for human immunodeficiency virus. The cerebrospinal fluid was slightly turbid, and in biochemical analysis, glucose level was 36 mg/dl, and proteins 110 mg/dl. On cerebrospinal fluid cytology, the presence of total white blood cell count was 90/mm <sup>3 </sup> , predominantly polymorphonuclear leukocytes. A provisional diagnosis of pyogenic meningitis was given to the patient. Gram stain was negative for bacteria and fungus, and India ink was negative for Cryptococcus neoformans . Some organisms on wet preparation of cerebrospinal fluid resembled Naegleria fowleri in the trophozoite stage. On staining, this organism with Giemsa stains a sky-blue cytoplasm with very pink nuclei and pseudopodia resembling Naegleria fowleri. There was no growth of fungus or bacteria on the pyogenic culture of cerebrospinal fluid done by the BacT Alert system (Organon Teknika, USA). The cerebrospinal fluid was negative for acid-fast bacilli or malignant cells. With the evidence of amoeba in cerebrospinal fluid, the patient was given a clinical diagnosis of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis. The fully expanded organism had a significantly consistent limax shape; the organism was broader in the anterior part and narrower in the posterior portion. In the anterior end, there was a single pseudopod that was not clear in agar culture preparation. The posterior end was narrow during motile, and sometimes a small number of intertwined debris was seen. Development of the uroid process was observed and reported; rounded, dormant forms and binary fission of vegetative trophozoites were also noted. Binucleate and uninucleate amoebae were also noted. Cerebrospinal fluid/agar culture with the trophozoite forms was changed to a test tube with 2.5 ml of distilled sterile water and incubated at 37 C for about 16–20 h. On microscopic observation of wet preparation, morphogenesis of amoeboid form to free swimming flagellates was noted. Pear-shaped body with two flagella helps the organism in forward motion. Some of the flagellates changed back to the amoeboid state after incubating for longer duration. In Table 55.1 shows the test results done in the patient.\nTable 55.1 删除换行 The patient’s laboratory results\n\n| Parameter  | Results  | Reference range  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Total leukocyte count Neutrophils—69% Lymphocyte—25% Eosinophils—2% Monocytes—4%  | 6800 cells/mm 3  | 4000–11,000 cells/mm 3 of blood  |\n| Platelets  | 210 × 10 9 cells/L  | 150 to 400 × 10 9 cells/L  |\n| Erythrocyte sedimentation rate  | 21 mm/h  | 0 to 22 mm/h for men and 0 to 29 mm/h for women  |\n| Hemoglobin concentration  | 12.5 g/dl  | 13.2 to 16.6 g/dl for men 11.6 to 15 g/dl for women  |\n| Glucose level (CSF)  | 36 mg/dl  | 50 to 80 mg/100 mL  |\n| Total leukocyte count (CSF)  | 90/mm 3  | 0–5 leukocytes/mm 3  |\n| Proteins (CSF)  | 110 mg/dl  | 18 to 58 mg/dl  |\n\n【32】Differential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【33】1.  1.\n\n【34】    Bacterial meningitis/encephalitis/pyogenic meningitis : Initially in our case, the patient exhibited symptoms such as severe frontal headache, neck stiffness, intermittent fever with body pain, nausea, and vomiting which are similar to the most common symptoms of bacterial meningitis including fever, neck stiffness, and headache; moreover on cerebrospinal fluid cytology, the total leukocyte count was 90/mm <sup>3 </sup> , predominantly with polymorphonuclear leukocytes which gave the provisional diagnosis of pyogenic meningitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【35】2.  2.\n\n【36】    Viral meningitis/encephalitis : In viral meningitis/encephalitis, there are common symptoms such as fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, confusion, and altered mental status and more severe symptoms such as seizure, weakness, and coma. Some of these mild and severe symptoms are seen in our patients. Both viral and bacterial meningitis are clinically overlapping making them difficult to distinguish.

Without a detailed history of exposure, it is challenging to identify primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, which presents as meningitis clinically. In our case, the preliminary diagnosis was given as fungal infection with involvement of sphenoid sinus and brain stem infarct, but later, based on the cerebrospinal fluid cytology, a provisional diagnosis suggestive of pyogenic meningitis was made; as the wet preparation of cerebrospinal fluid revealed, trophozoites of Naegleria fowleri have pointed toward the final diagnosis of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis. Symptoms such as headache, high-grade fever, photophobia, lethargy, confusion with an altered level of consciousness, and seizures should raise a suspicion of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis infection; among these most of the symptoms were exhibited by our patient. Death in most cases was due to increased intracranial pressure. Since the presentation of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis is often identical to bacterial meningitis, prompt identification is often too late, which increases the risk of death from infection due to cerebral edema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 10 \\]</u>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:46:17", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:46:48", "cost": 30.682}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:02", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:46:48", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:46:17"}

Advertising targets front删除8：<u>￾</u>line staff. Occupational health staff visit wards to easily facilitate immunisations, and some删除8：<u>￾</u>times incentives, such as chocolate and pens, are given to those who take up immunisation. \n\n【6】Whilst strongly encouraged, it is not currently compulsory for front-line staff to have the flu  删除换行1: vaccine.\n\n【7】The main proposed benefits of flu immunisation are that it may:\n\n【8】• Prevent staff transmitting flu to, and then between, patients\n\n【9】• Protect healthcare workers themselves from contracting flu, thus reducing sick leave  删除换行1: which can be particularly detrimental during winter pressures\n\n【10】The evidence regarding the effectiveness of the flu vaccine is disputed, and this has particu删除8：<u>￾</u>larly come to light with new evolving strains of flu, against which immunisation may be less  删除换行1: effective.\n\n【11】Some might argue that Claire has a moral obligation to be immunised. As a HCA, Claire  删除换行1: has a duty of care to protect her vulnerable patients, and accepting immunisation could be  删除换行1: considered part of this duty. The principle of non-maleficence requires that she does what she  删除换行1: can to avoid harming patients, and flu immunisation, even if not fully effective, may be one  删除换行1: way of doing this. The harms to Claire (for example, a sore arm, mild side effects or extremely  删除换行1: rare serious effects) may be outweighed by the benefits to patients, providing a consequen删除8：<u>￾</u>tialist justification for her consenting to immunisation. Furthermore, by accepting the risk  删除换行1: of such harms for the benefit of her patients, she is acting as a ‘virtuous’ healthcare profes删除8：<u>￾</u>sional, displaying the virtues of selflessness, altruism, professionalism and commitment to  删除换行1: her work.\n\n【12】Others may argue that Claire has no moral obligation to be immunised. Claire is an autono删除8：<u>￾</u>mous individual, and thus has the right to make decisions for herself in the same way that  删除换行1: a patient would have the right to make a decision about whether or not to be immunised. \n\n【13】This is particularly relevant in the case of flu immunisations, where the evidence supporting  删除换行1: the effectiveness of immunisation is not fully established. Furthermore, the benefit of Claire  删除换行1: being immunised is predominantly experienced by patients rather than by Claire herself, and  删除换行1: so the evidence for effectiveness might have to be stronger to justify obliging her to have the  删除换行1: immunisation. Incentivising the flu vaccine may also be problematic, as this could impact  删除换行1: on Claire’s ability to make a voluntary and autonomous choice. Claire should be provided  删除换行1: with information about the risks and benefits of immunisation in an unbiased form, and her  删除换行1: consent subsequently sought.\n\n【14】An interesting comparison may be made between the flu vaccine, which is currently not  删除换行1: compulsory, and the hepatitis B virus vaccine, which is compulsory for certain healthcare  删除换行1: workers. Whilst both the flu and hepatitis B immunisations have similar side effect profiles,  删除换行1: hepatitis B generally results in a more serious disease than flu, and therefore the harms that  删除换行1: are to be avoided through the hepatitis B immunisation may be greater. Furthermore, there is  删除换行1: strong evidence that the hepatitis B vaccine is very effective against transmission of the virus,  删除换行1: whereas the strength of evidence for flu immunisation is more disputed. By making hepa删除8：<u>￾</u>titis B immunisation compulsory, it can be inferred that the harms of overriding the rights  删除换行1: and autonomy of the individual healthcare worker are outweighed by the benefits obtained  删除换行1: through prevention of this disease.\n\n【15】Key Points\n\n【16】• There is no legal or professional obligation for healthcare workers to be immun删除8：<u>￾</u>ised against flu.\n\n【17】• The moral argument for mandatory immunisation is stronger in circumstances where  删除换行1: immunisation is increasingly effective at preventing transmission of the disease.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:34:34", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:34:52", "cost": 17.595}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:01", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:34:49", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:34:31"}

The ECG demonstrates a pattern characteristic of torsades de pointes. Quinidine, a class IA antiarrhythmic agent, is used to treat supraventricular arrhythmias by slowing conduction. A simultaneous increase of the QT interval caused by quinidine risks torsades de pointes.  \n\n【6】Answer A is incorrect . Adenosine is used both to diagnose and to treat supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. However, it is not associated with torsades des pointes.  \n\n【7】Answer B is incorrect . Although the class III antiarrhythmics tend to be associated with torsades des pointes, bretylium is an exception to this rule and has no association with this condition.  \n\n【8】Answer C is incorrect . Propranolol is a class II antiarrhythmic, but it is not associated with torsades de pointes. β Blockers such as propranolol are used to suppress abnormal pacemakers by decreasing the slope of phase 4 of the cardiac cycle; in other words, it slows the diastolic depolarization of pacemaker cells.  \n\n【9】Answer E is incorrect . Bepridil, not verapamil, is a calcium channel blocker and class IV antiarrhythmic known to be associated with torsades de pointes. Verapamil and diltiazem are two calcium channel blockers used in the prevention of nodal arrhythmias (eg, supraventricular tachycardia).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:51:03", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:51:07", "cost": 3.76}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:01", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:51:07", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:51:03"}

His heart rate is 115/min, respiratory rate is 24/min, and blood pressure is 140/80 mm Hg in both arms. Lung examination shows decreased breath sounds and decreased fremitus on the right with hyperresonance to percussion.

This patient is most likely suffering from a spontaneous pneumothorax. Caused by the rupture of a small apical bleb on the surface of the lung, spontaneous pneumothoraces typically present in tall young men. The patient usually has sudden pain and dyspnea. Examination will show decreased breath sounds and hyperresonance on the affected side. X-ray of the chest shows overexpansion of the rib cage and an elevated hemidiaphragm on the affected side. This paradoxical abdominal motion occurs because of the negative intrathoracic pressure that causes the fatigued diaphragm to be pulled into the thorax on the right side. Spontaneous pneumothorax is treated by inserting a chest tube to remove the air from the pleural space.  \n\n【7】Answer A is incorrect. Aortic dissection, not a pneumothorax, would show up on x-ray of the chest as a widened mediastinum. Aortic dissection can occur in trauma, or a dissecting aortic aneurysm can occur in connective tissue diseases such as Marfan disease. The physical findings are not consistent with aortic dissection: first, the chest would not be hyperresonant to percussion and second, the blood pressure would not be equal in both arms.  \n\n【8】Answer B is incorrect. Barrel chests and flattened diaphragms are seen in patients with obstructive lung diseases such as chronic emphysema. Although emphysema is caused by smoking, this patient does not have a long enough smoking history. It is possible that this man could have emphysema due to an α1 \\-antitrypsin deficiency, but in that case it would not present this acutely.  \n\n【9】Answer C is incorrect. Consolidation of the right lower lobe on x-ray of the chest usually means pneumonia. The patient would present with fever, productive cough, and a high WBC count. Physical exam would show decreased resonance on the affected side and increased fremitus.  \n\n【10】Answer D is incorrect. In tension pneumothorax, a flap-like pleural tear allows air to enter into the pleural cavity, but prevents its exit. It can be caused by penetrating trauma to the chest resulting in increased pleural cavity pressure. Clinical findings include sudden onset of severe dyspnea, tympanitic percussion, and absent breath sounds. There is tracheal deviation and mediastinal structure deviation to the contralateral side. If tension pneumothorax occurs on the left side, there would be compression of venous return to the heart.

Her coworkers find her awake and attempting to mouth words, but she is not capable of moving her limbs, and she is barely breathing. When paramedics arrive, she is unconscious and still barely breathing, so they intubate her. At the hospital, she opens her eyes spontaneously and appears to attend when spoken to. She can blink when asked but she cannot move her limbs. She appears to have no sensation below the neck. She is on ventilator support but is generating no spontaneous respiratory movements. When asked about pain, she indicates using blinks and facial gestures that her neck is very painful.\n\n【3】She is then medically sedated in order to obtain imaging studies. Computed tomography (CT) of the cervical spine reveals a burst fracture of the atlas, with bony fragments and soft tissue within the spinal canal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reveals severe edema of the upper cord from the level of the first cervical vertebra to the third. She is admitted to the surgical intensive care unit (ICU). Because she is sedated, the ICU attending and neurosurgeon approach the patient’s husband and parents. The neurosurgeon indicates that the patient is very likely to be permanently quadriplegic and dependent on ventilator support. She recommends surgery as soon as possible to stabilize the upper spine to minimize pain and maximize the likelihood of some neurologic recovery.\n\n【4】To the physicians’ surprise, the patient’s husband and her parents unanimously refuse surgery. Moreover, they explain that they are certain that the patient would refuse all life-sustaining therapy (LST). The patient’s husband has durable power of attorney for health care, also sometimes called a health care proxy, for his wife, and specifically requests that ventilator support be stopped and that she be allowed to die. The husband and parents all indicate that they have had prior discussions about spinal cord injury and disability with the patient, and that she has specifically stated that she “would rather be dead than \\[quadriplegic\\].” When the surgeon suggests waking the patient and discussing the matter with her, the family refuse, claiming that, “We know what she would want, and we’re not going to put her through that. She would definitely not want to go through the trauma of finding out about her condition.”\n\n【5】 Can the patient’s family, acting as the patient’s surrogates, refuse LST on her behalf, knowing that she will die as a result?\n\n【6】 If the patient were awake and refusing LST for herself, should her clinicians stop it, knowing that she will die as a result?\n\n【7】### ANSWERS TO CASE 29:\n\n【8】#### Withholding Life Support\n\n【9】Summary : A young woman experiences a high cervical spinal cord injury and is quadriplegic and ventilator-dependent. She is extremely unlikely to ever regain motor independence or breathe without the ventilator. At the moment she is sedated for acute evaluation of her injuries, but we know of no reason she would lack decision-making capacity if she were awoken. Her husband and her parents state that she 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> would not want to be kept alive in such a state, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> would not want to be woken up to be informed of her situation or make decisions for herself.\n\n【10】 Can the patient’s family refuse LST? Although it is usually the case that surrogates can refuse LST on behalf of an incapacitated patient, there are 2 strong arguments against honoring their request to stop her ventilator. The first is that this patient only lacks decision-making capacity because she is being medically sedated. Because she is able to make decisions for herself (at least as far as the clinicians and family know), then generally speaking, she should be consulted about decisions that will have major and irreversible impact on her life. The second is an argument that decisions to withdraw LST in the first hours, days, or weeks after a high cervical cord injury should be postponed.\n\n【11】 If the patient were awake and refusing LST for herself, should her clinicians withhold LST? Many experts in neurology and rehabilitation medicine argue that decisions to forego LST after a high cervical cord injury resulting in quadriplegia should be postponed until 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> some time has passed to allow the acute emotional and psychological trauma of the event to subside somewhat, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> the patient has had a chance to learn more about what their quality of life will be like in his or her new debilitated state. This amounts to denying the request of a patient who meets our usual standards for competence, which cannot be done indefinitely without unacceptably infringing her right to self-determination. Most commentators on this issue recommend a period of 6 months or more in a rehabilitation program before clinicians honor a request to stop LST.\n\n【12】### ANALYSIS\n\n【13】##### Objectives\n\n【14】1\\. Recognize the settings in which decisions should be made by patients and distinguish from settings in which surrogate decision-making is appropriate.\n\n【15】2\\. Understand the arguments for and against honoring a request to forego LST in the acute time period after a high cervical cord injury.\n\n【16】##### Considerations\n\n【17】When approaching a difficult case one should try to identify the decision-making standards that should be used. Is this a case of a competent patient who should decide for herself? It would seem so in this case, but this requires recognizing that the sedated patient is capable of decision-making. If the patient has lost decision-making capacity, has she made any advance directives that apply to the situation? Has she designated someone as the best surrogate?\n\n【18】One must also identify the range of ethically permissible courses that could be pursued. If it would not be ethically permissible to withdraw LST, then this should not be an option offered to the patient or her surrogates. If the patient or her surrogates ask to pursue an ethically impermissible course, then clinicians can and should resist the temptation to simply acquiesce. Clinicians should ask for help in the form of ethics and, in some cases, legal consultations.\n\n【19】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【20】#### Withholding Life Support\n\n【21】### DEFINITIONS\n\n【22】COMPETENCE : This is used interchangeably with decision-making capacity to refer to a patient’s ability to make medical decisions for himself or herself.\n\n【23】LIFE-SUSTAINING THERAPY : This phrase is typically used to refer to mechanical ventilation and artificial hydration and nutrition. However, it can also be used to refer to any therapy that is currently needed to keep the patient alive (eg, pressors, antibiotics, dialysis).\n\n【24】SUBSTITUTED JUDGMENT : The standard of decision-making wherein surrogates attempt to make the decision that the patient would have made, based on the surrogate’s knowledge of the patient’s values, preferences, and decision-making style.\n\n【25】### CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【26】In a difficult case in which patients or surrogates are requesting to pursue a course of treatment that the clinicians think is ethically impermissible, it is usually best to continue talking rather than take an action that cannot be easily reversed. Obviously, in this case, removing the ventilator would very rapidly become irreversible. Alternatively, if the clinicians insist on continuing LST, and even on pursuing surgery for the spinal fracture, the patient will still have the option later to discontinue LST. Continuing LST and performing surgery over the objections of the patient or her surrogates could obviously be contentious and lead to conflict between the parties. Clinicians should anticipate this, by being prepared to patiently explain their actions, and by consulting with others who can help the patient and family understand why the usual practice of honoring the request of patients, surrogates, or both to forego LST is not being pursued. This might include social workers, patient–family relationship professionals, ethics consultants, and, if necessary, legal counsel.\n\n【27】### DISCUSSION\n\n【28】To decide on the most ethically defensible course of action in a difficult case, it is best to start by trying to identify the ethical principles at stake. By identifying the type of question we are facing, we make it much easier to identify the principles we should rely on when choosing a course of action. This also allows us to draw on experience from other cases sharing similar ethical features, and helps ensure that we reason consistently from case to case.\n\n【29】At first glance, this case appears to be a case of deciding for others, in which family members or surrogates who know the patient have to make medical decisions on the patient’s behalf. If it is a case of deciding for others, then perhaps all we have to do is to ensure that the surrogates are well informed and are exercising substituted judgment (trying to make the decision they think the patient would have made, based on knowledge of the patient’s premorbid values and preferences). If those conditions are met, and the family agrees that the patient would not want LST, perhaps the most appropriate course is to cease ventilator support and allow the patient to die, while also ensuring to palliate any pain or suffering that might occur as a result.\n\n【30】However, there are a number of problems with this approach. One very important problem is that the patient described here potentially has the cognitive capacity to make decisions for herself. As far as we can tell, the only reason she is unconscious right now is because she is being medically sedated. If she is only temporarily incapacitated, especially if we the clinicians are the ones incapacitating her, then we should not think of her as lacking decision-making capacity. If she can participate in important medical decisions, then generally speaking she ought participate in those discussions. This is all the more important when the decisions come with such stark and irreversible consequences.\n\n【31】Perhaps, then, the clinicians should wake up the patient and discuss LST with her? If she wanted to continue LST, then she would need the cervical fusion, but the main topic of discussion would be about whether she wants to continue living, knowing that she is very likely (though it’s not absolutely certain) to remain a ventilator-dependent quadriplegic. Assuming she has capacity, discussing LST with her certainly seems like an important way to respect her autonomy as an individual. But, first we need to consider some important arguments against waking her up and letting her decide. One is the family’s argument that waking her up and discussing the situation with her would be horribly traumatic to the patient, and could only result in the same decision. Another is a more general point about when medical providers should allow patients, or surrogates on their behalf, to refuse LST after a sudden traumatic and life-altering event such as traumatic high cervical quadriplegia.\n\n【32】In this case, the parents argue quite plausibly that, if the patient were to be awakened and learn of her situation, then she would be emotionally devastated. Furthermore, they say that they are absolutely certain that they know what her decision will be in the end. Regarding the decision to wake her up, they also claim that they know she would not want to be woken up to learn of her situation. So what purpose would be served by discussing it with her?\n\n【33】In a sense, they are arguing that the decision to wake her up is a decision that can only be made by her surrogates. And, because they know the patient best, they should be allowed to exercise substituted judgment on her behalf regarding the question of whether to wake her up. This may well strike some readers as a plausible and perhaps even a persuasive argument. Other readers will probably disagree, believing that surrogates should only be permitted to make decisions for patients when they are incapacitated by their injury or their disease. (Though perhaps such a reader would allow an exception when surrogates make decisions that can later be reversed. For example, one might say that it is permissible for the surrogates to consent to the fusion surgery on behalf of the patient rather than wake her up, because the surgery does not commit her to indefinite LST, but it would not be permissible for the surrogates to refuse LST, because this is obviously an irreversible decision.)\n\n【34】There are reasonable arguments on either side about what role the surrogates should play in making decisions for a patient like this one. So let us set this problem aside for a moment and consider the second problem: when, if ever, should we allow “competent” patients to refuse LST after a sudden and severely debilitating injury like traumatic high cervical quadriplegia? Imagine that the family consented to the cervical fusion. The surgery is performed without complication, and it is now 4 days after her fall. We wake her up. We manage (with some difficulty, of course) to establish reliable communication with her using communication boards with eye movements and lip-reading, and all are in agreement that she is fully awake and able to understand what is being said to her. Imagine that she is appropriately emotionally distraught, but able to pass any cognitive tests that anyone proposes, and she is able to understand her medical situation and prognosis, at least as it is conveyed to her by her care providers. Finally, imagine that she indicates that she wants the ventilator turned off. Should the attending physician immediately honor this patient’s competent refusal of LST?\n\n【35】Generally speaking, physicians ought to honor competent patients’ informed voluntary refusal of any therapies, even life-sustaining therapies. For many, however, this type of case is the exception that proves the rule. Many but not all clinicians and ethicists argue that patients who suddenly lose their physical capabilities should not be permitted to refuse LST until 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> a period of time has passed to allow the acute emotional upset to subside, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> the patient has enough experience with her new disability to consider her perspective to be informed.\n\n【36】This argument, it should be noted, is not an all-or-none argument. No mainstream ethicist would argue that competent and informed vent-dependent quadriplegics must be forced to continue living on a ventilator indefinitely . Rather, the argument is that some amount of time should pass, and some amount of information-exchange and learning should occur before a decision to discontinue LST. Most who take this position will recommend at least a few months before such a decision, and some argue that as long as 2 years are required before patients have sufficient emotional capacity and relevant information about life with their disability. It is well known that patients’ perception of quality of life gradually changes after a sudden disability, and it is also true that nondisabled persons systematically underestimate quality of life with disability when compared with disabled persons’ perceptions of their own quality of life.\n\n【37】There appears to be a tension between the principle of beneficence on one hand and the principle of respect for autonomy on the other. Beneficence suggests that patients should be kept alive for a time because at least some of them will come to view life as a quadriplegic as acceptable and worth living. Respect for autonomy suggests that competent informed patients should not be subjected to medical interventions that they refuse. Early on in such a case, the principle of beneficence has strong persuasive power—should we at least give her a little time to think about her situation before withdrawing support? Later on, the principle of respect for autonomy gains more and more force: “You can’t keep me on LST against my wishes forever.”\n\n【38】Whenever we draw a line (a few days, a few weeks, a few months, a few years), it will be arbitrary and will not fully resolve the tension between the principles. So now we see that there aren’t any clear lines we can draw that will ‘solve’ the case, but we can identify some guiding principles:\n\n【39】1\\. Potentially competent patients should be permitted to participate in important medical decisions for themselves, particularly when the decision being contemplated is irreversible and consequential.\n\n【40】2\\. Whenever possible in the immediate aftermath of a devastating injury, decisions to discontinue LST should only be made in a deliberate fashion, after the relevant parties have had time to adjust emotionally and learn more directly about what life will be like after the injury. Most ethicists and clinicians recommend a waiting period from a few months to a few years after a high cervical cord injury before discontinuing LST. Ideally, patients in this situation should be allowed to learn about rehabilitation, and should meet other survivors of high cervical quadriplegia.\n\n【41】Both principles strongly suggest that the clinicians in this case should not simply honor the request of the family to turn off the ventilator within the first few days of the injury. Withdrawal of LST should only be seriously contemplated after the patient can be consulted, and only after an adjustment and information-exchange period has passed.\n\n【42】These conclusions are not uncontroversial. Some readers may even disagree strongly. This is a perfect opportunity to point out the importance and utility of consultation with parties who might have differing perspectives on such a case. Ethics consultation services are particularly helpful. Legal counsel might reasonably be sought. Experts in rehabilitation can be very useful, as can psychiatrists and neurologists, social workers, therapists, and others. No matter what decision is reached, when the stakes are high and there are widely divergent opinions among the stakeholders, it is wise to be slow and deliberate, making use of wide consultation.\n\n【43】###", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:50:11", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:50:31", "cost": 19.778}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:01", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:50:30", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:50:10"}

Know the treatments for the corresponding causes of vaginitis and vaginosis.\n\n【14】Considerations\n\n【15】This 18-year-old woman complains of a vaginal discharge that has a fishy odor， which is the most common symptom of bacterial vaginosis. The discharge associ-ated with BV has a typical white， homogenous vaginal coating， described as spilled milk over the tissue\"The pH is not given in this scenario， but it is likely alkaline. Although a whiff test was not performed with potassium hydroxide (KOH) in this patient， the worsening of the discharge after intercourse is presumably due to the alkaline semen. The vaginal epithelium is not erythematous or inflamed， which also fits with bacterial vaginosis. Of the three most common causes of infectious vaginal discharge (Candida， Trichomonas， and BV)， bacterial vaginosis is the only etiology that is not inflammatory (hence the suffix “-osis”and not “-itis.\") BV is a result of a predominance of anaerobic bacteria rather than a true infection. There-fore， antibiotic therapy targeting anaerobes， such as metronidazole or clindamycin， is appropriate.\n\n【16】BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS： Condition of excessive anaerobic bacteria in the vagina， leading to a discharge that is alkaline.\n\n【17】CANDIDA VULVOVAGINITIS： Vaginal and/ or vulvar infection caused by Can-dida species， usually with heterogeneous discharge and inflammation.\n\n【18】TRICHOMONAS VAGINITIS： Infection of the vagina caused by the protozoa Trichomonas vaginalis， usually associated with a frothy green discharge and intense inflammatory response.\n\n【19】The three most common types of vaginal infections are bacterial vaginosis， trichomo-nal vaginitis， and candidal vulvovaginitis .\n\n【20】Bacterial vaginosis is not a true infection， but rather an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria， which replaces the normal lactobacilli of the vagina. Although it may be sexually transmitted， this is not always the case. The most common symptom is a fishy or“musty”odor， often exacerbated by menses or intercourse. Since both of these situations introduce an alkaline substance， the vaginal pH is elevated above normal. The addition of 10% potassium hydroxide solution leads to the release of amines， causing a fishy odor (whifftest). There is no inflammatory reaction； hence， the patient will not complain of swelling or irritation， and typically， the microscopic examination does not usually reveal leukocytes. Microscopy of the discharge in normal saline (wet mount) typically shows clue cells ， which are coccoid bacteria adherent to the external surfaces of epithelial cells. Three out of four Amsel's criteria are indicative of BV： 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> homogenous， gray-white discharge，通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> vaginal pH > 4.5， 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> positive whiff test， and 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> clue cells on wet mount. The Gram stain is considered the gold standard for diagnosing BV but is rarely per-formed clinically.\n\n【21】Bacterial vaginosis is associated with genital tract infections such as endome-tritis， pelvic inflammatory disease， and pregnancy complications such as preterm delivery and preterm premature rupture of membranes. Treatment includes oral or vaginal metronidazole. Patients should be instructed to avoid alcohol while tak-ing metronidazole to avoid a disulfiram reaction. Clindamycin is another effective treatment.\n\n| Table 38-1·CHARACTERISTICS OF VARIOUS VAGINAL INFECTIONS  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Bacterial Vaginosis  | TrichomonalVaginitis  | Candidal Vulvovag initis  |\n| Appearance  | Homogeneous， whitedischarge  | Frothy， yellow togreen  | Curdy，lumpy  |\n| Vaginal pH  | \\>4.5  | \\>4.5  | <4.5  |\n| Whiff test (fishy odorwith KOH)  |   |   | None  |\n| Microscopy  | Clue cells (>20%ofthe cells seen)  | Trichomonads  | Pseudohyphae  |\n| Treatment  | Metronidazole  | Metronidazole  | Oral fluconazole or imidazole cream  |\n删除14：<u>A</u>删除14：<u>B</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 38-1.

It is a common sexually transmitted dis-ease. Trichomonas vaginalis can survive for up to 6 hours on a wet surface. Aside from causing infection of the vagina， this organism can also inhabit the urethra or Skenes glands. The most common symptom associated with trichomoniasis is a profuse “frothyyellow- green to gray vaginal discharge or vaginal irritation. Intense inflammation of the vagina or cervix may be noted， with the classic punc-tate lesions of the cervix (strawberry cervix). A fishy odor is also common with this disorder， which is somewhat exacerbated with KOH. Microscopy in saline will often display mobile， flagellated organisms. If the wet mount is cold or there are excess leukocytes present， the movement of the trichomonads may be inhibited. Nucleic acid amplification testing is more sensitive than wet mount microscopy. Optimal treatment consists of a fairly high dose of metronidazole (2 g orally) as a one-time dose， with the partner treated as well. Resistant cases may require the same dose every day for 7 days. A newer antiprotozoal agent， Tinidazole， has a similar dosing， side-effect profile， and contraindication for concurrent alcohol； due to its expense， its main role is for metronidazole-resistant cases. Treatment usually does not include vaginal metronidazole because of low therapeutic levels in the ure-thra or Skenes glands where trichomonads may reside.\n\n【23】Candidal vaginitis is usually caused by the fungus， Candida albicans， although other species may be causative. The lactobacilli in the vagina inhibit fungal growth；\n\n【24】thus， antibiotic therapy may decrease the lactobacilli concentration， leading to Can-dida overgrowth. Diabetes mellitus， which suppresses immune function， may also predispose patients to these infections. Candidiasis is usually not a sexually trans-mitted disease. The patient usually presents with intense vulvar or vaginal burning， irritation， and swelling. Dyspareunia (pain with intercourse) may also be a promi-nent complaint. The discharge usually appears curdy or like cottage cheese， in con-trast to the homogenous discharge of bacterial vaginosis. Also， unlike the alkaline pH of BV and Trichomonas infection， the vaginal pH in candidiasis is typically normal (<4.5). The microscopic diagnosis is confirmed by identification of the hyphae or pseudohyphae after the discharge is mixed with potassium hydroxide. The KOH solution lyses the leukocytes and erythrocytes， making identification of the candidal organisms easier. Treatment includes oral fluconazole (Diflucan) or topical imidazoles， such as terconazole (Terazol)， miconazole (Monistat)， and clotrimazole (Lotrimin).\n删除16：<u>CASE CORRELATION\n删除25：<u>See also Case 36 (Gonococcal Cervicitis) to understand the diagnostic approach of abnormal vaginal discharge and trying to discern a cervical ver-sus a vaginal etiology.</u>\n</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 13:47:49", "endTime": "2024/09/14 13:48:33", "cost": 43.989}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:01", "update_time": "2024-09-13 21:48:32", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 21:47:48"}

Her daughter relates a history of progressive decline in her mother’s cognitive function over the last year. The mother has lived on her own for many years, but recently she has begun to become unable to take care of herself. The daughter states that her mother has become withdrawn and has lost interest in her usual activities, such as gardening and reading. The patient was always a fastidious housekeeper; however, recently she is noted to wear the same clothes for several days, and her house is unkempt and dirty. She seems anxious and confused, and she calls her daughter several times a day, worried that the neighbors, previously good friends, are spying on her. She denies bowel or urinary incontinence, and she has had no trouble with headaches or gait instability. Overall the patient has been very healthy, and she only receives treatment with hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension. She never smoked and drank alcohol only rarely. On examination, her blood pressure is 116/56 mm Hg, heart rate 78 bpm, temperature 98.7°F, and respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute. Her weight is 160 lb and her height is 5 ft 3 in. She is noted to be well developed, but her affect throughout the examination is rather flat. She is oriented to person and place, but she is a little confused as to the date. Head, neck, and cardiovascular examinations are unremarkable. Abdomen is benign. The extremities are without edema, cyanosis, or clubbing. Neurologic examination reveals that the cranial nerves are intact, and the motor and sensory examinations are within normal limits. Cerebellar examination is unremarkable, and the gait is normal.

As in other cases of major organ system failure (heart and kidney failures), dementia (brain failure) deserves some investigation into treatable or reversible causes before assigning a diagnosis such as Alzheimer disease, which is incurable and progressive and for which no highly effective therapy exists .\n删除4：<u>Table 49–1 • ABBREVIATED WORKUP FOR DEMENTIA</u>\n\n【19】Complete blood count (CBC) and consider erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)\n\n【20】Chemistry panel\n\n【21】Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level\n\n【22】Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL)\n\n【23】Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) assay\n\n【24】Urinalysis\n\n【25】Serum vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> and folate levels\n\n【26】Chest radiograph\n\n【27】Electrocardiogram (ECG)\n\n【28】Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head\n\n【29】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【30】#### Dementia\n\n【31】#### DEFINITIONS\n\n【32】DEMENTIA: Impairment of memory and at least one other cognitive function (eg, language, visuospatial orientation, judgment) without alteration in consciousness, representing a decline from previous level of ability and interfering with daily functioning and independent living.\n\n【33】ALZHEIMER DISEASE: Leading cause of dementia, accounting for half of the cases involving elderly individuals, correlating to diffuse cortical atrophy and hippocampal atrophy with ventricular enlargement. The pathologic changes in the brains of patients with Alzheimer disease include neurofibrillary tangles with deposition of abnormal amyloid in the brain.\n\n【34】MULTI-INFARCT DEMENTIA: Dementia in the setting of cerebrovascular disease, occurring after multiple cerebral infarctions, whether large or small (lacunar).\n\n【35】#### CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【36】In assessing the patient with dementia, the clinician should strive to answer three questions: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> What is the most likely diagnosis? 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> Is any treatable or reversible condition contributing to the patient’s cognitive decline? 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> What interventions are available to preserve the patient’s level of function and relieve the burden to caregivers?\n\n【37】To answer the first question, the most important investigation is the history of symptoms. If the patient has an acute or subacute onset of confusion or has a fluctuating level of consciousness, the most likely diagnosis is a delirium resulting from infection, intoxication, or adverse medication effects, or metabolic derangements such as hyponatremia, hypercalcemia, or hypoglycemia.\n\n【38】If cognitive decline occurs with prominent mood disturbance, then one consideration is depression or pseudodementia. Distinguishing which occurred first is often difficult because many elderly patients with cognitive decline and a declining level of independent functioning suffer from a reactive depression. History provided by involved family members regarding the onset of symptoms or history of prior depression or other psychiatric illness may help establish the diagnosis, and an empiric trial of antidepressants may be considered.\n\n【39】If the patient has a history of irregular stepwise decline in functioning, especially if the patient has had apparent stroke symptoms or transient ischemic events or has a known cardiovascular disease or atrial fibrillation, then multi-infarct dementia is the most likely diagnosis. This type of vascular dementia is the second most common cause of dementia in the United States, composing 10% to 20% of dementias. Other patients with cerebrovascular disease, especially as a result of long-standing hypertension, may develop diffuse subcortical white matter changes seen on imaging and an insidious rather than sudden stepwise decline in cognitive function. This condition is often referred to as Binswanger disease .\n\n【40】Other common causes of dementia include cognitive decline as a result of longstanding alcoholism or dementia associated with parkinsonism . Both of these underlying conditions are readily discovered by the appropriate associated medical history.\n\n【41】Less common causes of dementia include medical conditions such as Wernicke encephalopathy resulting from thiamine (vitamin B <sub>1 </sub> ) deficiency, vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> deficiency resulting from pernicious anemia, untreated hypothyroidism , or chronic infections such as HIV dementia or neurosyphilis . A variety of primary central nervous system (CNS) diseases can lead to dementia, including Huntington disease, multiple sclerosis, neoplastic diseases such as primary or metastatic brain tumors (although they are much more likely to produce seizures or focal deficits rather than dementia), or leptomeningeal spread of various cancers.\n\n【42】Normal pressure hydrocephalus is a potentially reversible form of dementia in which the cerebral ventricles slowly enlarge as a result of disturbances to cerebral spinal fluid resorption. The classic triad is dementia, gait disturbance, and urinary or bowel incontinence . Relief of hydrocephalus through placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt may reverse the cognitive decline. Descriptions of the primary neurologic diseases associated with cognitive dysfunction are listed in Table 49–2 .\n删除4：<u>Table 49–2 • CAUSES OF DEMENTIA</u>\n\n【43】Once likely diagnoses have been established by history and physical examination, investigation should be undertaken to look for treatable or reversible causes. The choice of laboratory or imaging tests is not straightforward because of the numerous, yet uncommon, causes of reversible dementia, so testing is generally low yield. Tests that may be considered for the evaluation of dementia are listed in Table 49–1 . The American Academy of Neurology recommends routine assessment of thyroid function tests, a vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> level, and a neuroimaging study (either CT or MRI of the brain).\n\n【44】For patients with Alzheimer disease, the average life expectancy after diagnosis is 7 to 10 years. The clinical course is characterized by progressive decline of cognitive functions (memory, orientation, attention, and concentration) and the development of psychological and behavioral symptoms (wandering, aggression, anxiety, depression, and psychosis). The goals of treatment in Alzheimer disease are to 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> improve cognitive function, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> reduce behavioral and psychological symptoms, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> improve the quality of life. Donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine are cholinesterase inhibitors that are effective in improving cognitive function and global clinical state . Antagonists to N \\-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors , such as memantine , are effective in moderate to severe dementia. Risperidone reduces psychotic symptoms and aggression in patients with dementia.\n删除4：<u>Table 49–3 • CLINICAL COURSE OF ALZHEIMER DISEASE</u>\n\n【45】Other issues include wakefulness, nightwalking and wandering, aggression, incontinence, and depression. A structured environment, with predictability, and judicious use of pharmacotherapy, such as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) for depression or trazodone for insomnia, are helpful. The primary caregiver is often overwhelmed and needs support.

Crohn disease anatomic locations remain fairly stable in most patients over the patient’s lifetime. The disease characteristics can vary during the lifetime of the patient with Crohn disease， but the inflammatory pattern is the most common initial presenting pattern. Anorectal presentation is the initial pre-sentation in 10% of patients. Crohn disease rarely affects the esophagus.\n\n【50】26.2 E. Terminal ileum/right colon disease is seen in 35% to 50% of patients； ileal disease is seen in 30% to 35% of patients； colonic disease is seen in 25% to35% of patients； stomach/duodenal disease is seen in 0.5% to 4% of patients.\n\n【51】26.3 C. Medical refractory disease is the most common indication for surgery in Crohn disease patients. The role of surgery is to improve the patient ’s quality of life， and surgery has no impact on the disease itself. Repeat operations are required in up to 50% of surgical patients. Surgery is indicated when medical therapy is not working or if medical treatment side effects are compromising the patients'quality of life significantly.\n\n【52】26.4 D. This patient’s presentation is compatible with enterocutaneous fistula pre-sumably related to Crohn disease. Enterocutaneous fistula formation in the setting of Crohn disease does not always require surgical treatment， espe-cially when it is associated with minimal amount of systemic systems. A trial of conservative treatment including infliximab may be helpful to promote spontaneous closure of the fistula. The rate of enteric fistula closure using infliximab has been reported to range from 6% to 70%.\n\n【53】26.5IB. Medical therapy is the appropriate choice for this patient with uncompli-cated and newly diagnosed Crohn disease. A CT scan might be helpful during the initial evaluation to help rule-out the presence of intra-abdominal abscess and to rule out appendicitis.\n\n【54】26.6 E.

Surgery is also indicated for these same complications if a patient does not respond to medical therapy， or if medical therapy compromises the patients'quality of life significantly.\n\n【55】26.7B.

There are many risk factors associated with ureteral injury； however， the majority are associated with laparoscopic hysterectomies. Other risk factors include： cancer， extensive adhesions， endometriosis， tubo-ovarian abscess， residual ovaries， interligamentous leiomyomata， and most gynecological procedures. Also， the presentation of fever and flank tenderness after sur-gery makes the diagnosis of ureteral ligation most likely in comparison to the other options. When the ureter is ligated， the patient is at an increased risk of hydronephrosis and/ or hydroureter. Antibiotic treatment and relief of the obstruction should be administered promptly to avoid the situation in this scenario of pyelonephritis. Patients with a bladder perforation injury typically present with gross hematuria， pain， or tenderness in the suprapubic region and difficulty in voiding. Ureters are not typically \"dissected out\"dur-ing a hysterectomy； therefore， it would be unlikely for ischemia to occur in this situation.\n\n【12】32.2 C. O ver dissection of the ureter may lead to devascularization injury because the ureter receives its blood supply from various arteries along its course and flows along its adventitial sheath. Urine is leaked into the abdominal cavity and causes irritation to the intestines and induces nausea and emesis. With a vesicovaginal fistula， urine is continuously leaking out the vagina， but not into the abdominal cavity. Nausea and vomiting are not associated with any ofthe other answer choices except for bladder perforation. In bladder perforation injuries， patients present with pain in the suprapubic region.\n\n【13】32\\. 3 3 A. Constant urinary leakage after pelvic surgery is a typical history for vesi-covaginal fistula 删除25：<u></u>. In other words， there is a constant connection between the bladder and vagina.

Her risk of accreta is most likely not affected by the myomectomy.\n\n【17】D.IIf the myomectomy incisions are anterior， then she has an increased risk of a placental polyp.\n\n【18】12.1D. Placenta accreta is more common with increasing number of cesareans and placenta previa. Three prior cesareans with placenta previa are associated with up to a 50% risk for placenta accreta， in which the decidua basalis layer is defective. It is the endometrial layer that is defective and not the myome-trial layer. Nevertheless，the placenta may grow into the myometrium or even through the entire uterus to the serosa.\n\n【19】12.2 C. The blue tissue densely adherent between the uterus and bladder is very characteristic of percreta， where the placenta penetrates entirely through the myometrium to the serosa and adheres to the bladder. Hematuria may be present in this situation. These findings are not typically found with placenta accreta or polyps. Malignant melanoma can metastasize to the placenta， but this is much less common under these circumstances.\n\n【20】12.33 C. The best management of placenta accreta is hysterectomy due to the great risk of hemorrhage if the placenta is attempted to be removed. When the patient refuses hysterectomy， then ligation of the umbilical cord as high as possible and attempt at IV methotrexate therapy has been attempted with limited success. Other than hemorrhage， the other complication to be con-cerned about is infection. The necrosis of the placental tissue can be a nidus for infection.\n\n【21】CASE FILES： OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY\n\n【22】12.4( C. In general， myomectomy incisions on the serosal (outside) surface of the uterus do not predispose to accreta because the endometrium is not disturbed. However， the risk of accreta is not decreased due to the myomectomy either. Placental polyps result from retained products after either a term pregnancy or incomplete abortion， and occur inside the uterus. Therefore， the location of the incisions for a myomectomy will not influence whether or not a patient develops polyps. Placental implantation over a submucosal uterine fibroid may increase the risk of focal accreta.\n\n【23】CLINICALPEARLS\n\n【24】The usual management ofplacenta accreta/previa (abnormaladherence of the placenta to the uterus) is prelabor cesarean hysterectomy around34 to 35 weeks， after betamethasone administration (without amniocen-tesis for fetal lung maturity indices).\n\n【25】Placenta accreta is associated with a defect in the decidua basalis(Nitabuchs) layer and a significant increase in maternal mortality risk\n\n【26】》 The risk of placenta accreta increases in a woman with a prior uterine incision and placenta previa.

It is associated with deletion of the VHL gene， a tumor suppressor gene on the short arm of chromosome 3. Approximately 25% of cases occur sporadically. In the United States， the incidence of VHL disease is approximately 1：36，000.\n\n【6】What is the pathophysiology underlying the formation of hemangiomas in this condition?\n\n【7】One of the main functions of VHL protein is to regulate the activity of a transcription factor known as hypoxia-induced factor 1a (HIF1a). HIF1a activation induces the transcription of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)， which is responsible for the process of neovascularization. As its name suggests， HIF1a activation occurs under hypoxic conditions to facilitate the growth of new blood vessels in response to low oxygen levels. The VHL protein， as a tumor suppressor gene product， facilitates degradation of HIF1 a in the presence of oxygen to restrict unnecessary neovascularization. However， the mutations in VHL disease cause HIF1 a to be constitutively active. This causes the overproduction of VEGF and the formation hemangiomas.\n\n【8】What is the leading cause of death in patients with this condition?\n\n【9】RCC， predominantly the clear cell type， is the leading cause of death in patients with VHL； some case series report prevalence rates as high as 40%-75% at autopsy. In patients with VHL， RCC develops from malignant degeneration of renal cysts and is usually bilateral. The average age for development of RCC in patients with VHL is 44 years. Because of the high incidence of renal cysts and RCC in patients with VHL， periodic imaging of the kidneys is indicated in patients and at-risk relatives.\n\n【10】What other tumors or lesions are associated with this condition?\n\n【11】Patients with VHL disease are at risk for developing multiple cysts in the liver， epididymis， pancreas， and kidneys. Pheochromocytomas， rare pancreatic carcinomas， and endolymphatic sac tumors are also within the spectrum of VHL. Hemangioblastomas are typically in the cerebellum or medulla but may also occur in the spinal cord.

Brainstem abnormalities include abnormalities within medullary respiratory centres， and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT or serotonin) receptors of the arcuate nucleus. Serotonin is an important neurotransmitter and is involved in influencing respiratory drive and arousal， cardiovascular control， thermoregulation， and upper airway reflexes. Altered serotonin homeostasis may therefore create an underlying vulnerability contributing to SIDS 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u>.\n\n【28】Risk factors， protective factors and advice： Risk factors from multiple studies on infants with SIDS include：\n\n【29】1.Pregnancy-related risk factors： Multiple gestation， prematurity， low birth weight and intrauterine growth restriction all are associated with higher incidence of SIDS 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u>. Preterm infants have a fourfold increased risk as compared to their term counterparts， and parents should be counselled about this prior to discharge通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>.\n\n【30】2\\. Cigarette smoking： Intrauterine exposure to cigarette smoke increases the risk of SIDS up to fivefold. Studies have also shown that the risk of SIDS increases with daily cigarette use and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u>. As a result， parents should be encouraged to reduce smoking as much as possible during pregnancy and after birth and to discourage smoking around the baby.\n\n【31】3.Drug and alcohol use： Prenatal drug use， especially opiates， has been linked with increased risk of SIDS. While prenatal and post-natal alcohol use has not been associated with SIDS， some studies have also found that maternal consumption of alcohol in the 24 hours prior the infant's death carried a 2 to 8-fold increased risk of SIDS 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u>. Parents should be encouraged to avoid the use of alcohol and illicit drugs.\n\n【32】4\\. Sleeping position： Prone sleeping position has been consistently shown to increase the risk of SIDS 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>. Side sleeping was also identified as a risk factor， likely due to the relative instability of this position and infants rolling to a prone position during sleep. The current recommendation is for supine position for sleeping (\"back to sleep\") for all infants except those few with specific medical conditions for which recommending a different position may be justified 通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u>. It is important to reassure parents who are concerned about the risk of choking in supine position， as evidence shows that the risk of regurgitation and choking is highest in prone-sleeping infants.\n\n【33】5.Sleeping place： Sleeping on a sofa or couch increases the risk of SIDS 67-fold. 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Parents should be counselled about this and advised that it is riskier to feed their baby on a sofa than on a bed. Moreover， bed sharing- a situation where an adult (typically one or both parents) brings the infant on to the same surface (usually， but not limited to， a mattress) for sleep has been associated with an increased risk of SIDS. 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> While it is a common practice in many healthcare settings， the current recommendations are that infants aged less than 6 months should sleep in their own cot and not share a sleeping surface with a parent， caregiver， or other child 通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u>.\n\n【34】6.Bed surfaces and bedding： Soft bedding increases the risk of SIDS， and infants with SIDS were more likely to have been found with their head covered by loose bedding. 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Infants should be placed to sleep on a firm， well-fitting mattress which is flat. Parents should avoid using any loose or soft bedding that could cover an infant’s face such as heavy blankets， pillows， or cot bumpers， and should not place toys in the cot. If blankets are used， infants should be placed with their feet at the foot of the cot and the blanket tucked in on three sides to reduce the risk of the head becoming covered. A good alternative to blankets is an infant sleeping bag 通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u>.\n\n【35】7\\. Temperature： Studies have shown that overheating was associated with increased risk of SIDS. This may be related to a failure of thermal autoregulation or the fact that babies in the prone position tend to have a higher body temperature. Parents are advised to keep their baby not too warm， nor too cold and to avoid placing the cot next to a radiator or heat source， and making sure their heads are not covered by bedclothes or hats when they are asleep indoors 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u>.\n\n【36】The following factors which have been shown to protect against the risk of SIDS：\n\n【37】1.Breast feeding： breast feeding has been linked with reduced risk reduction of SIDS by 50%通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>. The protective effective was strongest with exclusive breast feeding. Parents should therefore be strongly encouraged to breastfeed for this as well as other health benefits 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u>.\n\n【38】2.Room sharing： Infants sleeping in their own cot in the parental bedroom were found to have reduced risk of SIDS by 50%. This is likely due to parents being able to closely monitor their children and therefore reduce the risk of suffocation， strangulation or entrapment 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>. Parents should be advised to room share for the first 6 to 12 months 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u>.\n\n【39】3.Pacifiers： There is strong evidence that children dying from SIDS were less likely to have used a pacifier during their last sleep. While some countries advocate the use of pacifiers as a risk reduction strategy for SIDS， this is not the case in the UK. Parents wanting to breastfeed should avoid its use in the first 3-4 weeks when breastfeeding is being established 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>.\n\n【40】Advice to expectant parents following SIDS related death\n\n【41】The next born siblings of infants dying of any non-infectious natural cause are at significantly increased risk for infant death from the same cause， including SIDS. There is a 9 fold increased risk for the same cause of death. This increased risk in families who have experienced SIDS is consistent with genetic factors interacting with environmental risk factors 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u>.Parents enquiring about home monitoring equipment (apnoea alarm， respiratory， cardiac， oxygen saturation monitoring) should be advised that numerous studies have shown that there is no decreased risk of SIDS in infants using these 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u>. Home monitoring equipment is therefore not recommended to prevent SIDS， although it may be appropriate in select group of infants (e.g. complex patients on long term ventilation) 通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u>.\n\n【42】Having an infant death from SIDS is an extremely traumatic experience for any parent.

In the early 1800s, French surgeons described and advocated advancement flaps under the term “lambeau par glissement” (sliding flaps) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Since then these flaps have become widely used to close skin defects, especially those of the forehead.\n\n【15】The forehead is a large and highly expressive and dynamic cosmetic unit. Most forehead defects that cannot be closed primarily are reconstructed with laterally based advancement flaps 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. As with any cutaneous defect, options for closure include secondary intention (no closure), primary closure, skin grafting and rearranging adjacent tissue as a random cutaneous flap. Of course tissue expansion works well but not only does this need two stages, but it is inconvenient for a patient to be walking around with the noticeable bulge of a tissue expander under the skin of his forehead. Rotation flaps work very well on the scalp as we have discussed, but given their scar-line runs across forehead crease lines, they offer a poor choice for reconstruction of forehead defects. Skin grafts are routinely performed by many plastic surgeons for mid-forehead defects. However, in my opinion, skin grafts are a poor choice for the middle of the forehead, as they tend to leave a very noticeable color mismatch.\n\n【16】It is extremely common to use advancement flaps on the forehead, as their incision lines can be hidden among forehead wrinkles. For larger defects, bilateral advancement flaps are useful and for lateral forehead and temporal defects, transposition flaps are often used 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Within the dermis there are two distinct vascular arcades: a superficial vascular plexus that runs between the reticular and papillary dermis, and a more robust deep vascular plexus or “subdermal” plexus that runs between the reticular dermis and subcutaneous tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. As the advancement flaps become longer to close larger defects, it is important that the dissection is progressively deepened towards the base of the flap to ensure supply from the larger-bore vessels.\n\n【17】Advancement flaps depend on the advancement of the surrounding tissue along a linear axis to close a defect . The advancement of two skin edges from a fusiform skin excision represents the simplest of advancement flap design 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Classically, advancement flaps have a length-to-width ratio of 1:1 or 2:1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u> – and going beyond 3:1 may lead to flap necrosis.\n\n【18】删除3：<u>Figure 5.1 删除换行1: ( a ) H-advancement flap design. ( b ) Advancement flap illustration</u>\n\n【19】Advancement flaps are reliant on a random pattern blood supply, which comes from the anastomoses within the subdermal or dermal plexus. The perfusion pressure of feeding vessels and intravascular resistance determines the viable length of an advancement flap. In well-vascularized areas such as the forehead and scalp, it is possible to sometimes go beyond the 3:1 length-to-width ratio.\n\n【20】However, closure of very large >5 cm defects can pose a great challenge for the cutaneous surgeon. Reconstruction of the forehead using bilateral advancement ‘H’ flaps is discussed here, with my preferred method of increasing tissue mobility by utilizing the concept of sub-periosteal undermining. In this context, the relevant anatomy of advancement flaps, the underlying structures of the forehead, dissection techniques and a review of advancement flaps is undertaken.\n\n【21】Case Studies\n\n【22】1.\n\n【23】A 36 year old Chinese gentleman presented with a large 5 cm squamous cell cancer on his forehead. Firstly the diagnosis was unusual for his skin type, especially given his age. This further posed a reconstructive conundrum – if the flap involved the lower forehead, it would pull his eyebrows closer together. Obviously, a lesion of this size could not be closed primarily. I decided to use a double-advancement flap with one of the incisions extending onto the frontal hairline. This minimizes the visible scar on the forehead. I have found this useful forehead in patients with few wrinkles on the forehead, as if often the case in young Asians. Secondly, dissection was proceeded in the sub-periosteal plane in the temporal scalp to gain further mobility of the skin flaps and to achieve primary closure .\n\n【24】删除3：<u>Figure 5.2\n\n【25】SCC forehead and plan of advancement flaps</u>\n\n【26】删除3：<u>Figure 5.3\n\n【27】Advancement flaps sutured in place</u>\n\n【28】2.\n\n【29】An 80-year old gentleman presented with a large 5 cm deeply infiltrating BCC of his central forehead. The simplest choice here may have been a skin graft but this would leave him with an area of de-pigmentation on his central forehead. Planning a double-advancement flap in this case isn’t easy – because when faced with a lesion of this size, mobilizing flaps would move the eyebrows closer. This is where the technique of sub-periosteal undermining in the temporal region proves effective in gaining valuable inches of skin. For a start, sub-periosteal dissection spares the temporal blood vessels which are liable to get damaged during superficial dissections. Further there is also concern of damage to the facial nerve branch if one was to proceed the discussion over the upper zygomatic region. Inferior to the zygomatic arch, the facial nerve branches travel below the SMAS layer and innervate the muscles of facial expression via the underside of the muscles. With standard double advancement flaps and utilizing sub-periosteal undermining, primary closure was achieved easily while ensuring the safety of vital structures .\n\n【30】删除3：<u>Figure 5.4\n\n【31】Large infiltrating BCC central forehead</u>\n\n【32】删除3：<u>Figure 5.5\n\n【33】Bilateral advancement flaps sutured in place</u>\n\n【34】Discussion\n----------\n\n【35】Double opposing ‘H’ flaps offer a high degree of patient satisfaction when planned well and can be used for defects up to 6 cm in diameter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. While planning any large flaps (or indeed any flap), it is preferable to achieve margin control i.e. ensure that the tumor has been excised completely. As discussed earlier, the H-flap is essentially two rectangular flaps that are advancement from opposing sides to close the defect. Ebrahimi and colleagues reserve this flap for tumors in upper middle or lateral portion of the forehead, defect size between 4 cm and 6 cm, no bone involvement, and patients with no history of radiotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. When one of the limbs of the flap is hidden in the hairline (as we have done in “ Case study 1. ”) it allows for a superior end result.\n\n【36】However, when dissection proceeds over the temporal scalp and temporal region, typically it becomes more difficult to achieve flap mobility. Psillakis and others described the technique of sub-periosteal dissection while performing facelifts as open non-endoscopic procedures. The thinking was that as the SMAS was firmly attached to the periosteum through the facial muscles, this technique improved mobility of the cheek and temple 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【37】In the temporal region, the dissection is deepened to expose the deep temporalis fascia. The loose areolar issue that forms the plane between the superficial and deep fascia in the temporal region allows for easy dissection down to the sub-periosteal plane, which is then raised using tissue elevators. The lateral extent of this sub-periosteal dissection is marked to ensure no damage to the branches of the facial nerve 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Dissecting in the sub-periosteal plane avoids branches of the supraorbital and supratrochlear vessels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Revascularisation in the sub-periosteal plane is rapid, as early as 4 days according to several authors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. However, I would stress that I only resort to sub-periosteal dissection when the defects are greater than 5 cm and it is obvious that closure of the advancement flaps is not possible in the conventional fashion. In other cases of scalp dissection, the sub-galeal plane is both easier and is adequate. There have been some concerns raised by some authors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u> about the possibility of sub-periosteal dissection affecting the regenerative capacity of the calvarium, even though the technique does help close these large defects. This is after all a method that has been borrowed from techniques honed by years of facelift anatomical research. Periosteal elevation causes an increase in overall cell counts during wound healing as well as cortical abnormalities. Dissection in the sub-galeal plane preserves the important bone–periosteal interface and seems to elicit less vigorous wound healing response both cellularly and vascularly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. While more histological research is needed, the technique of sub-periosteal elevation does offer major advantages in helping us close very large defects of the forehead with less eyebrow and vital structure distortion (than would be the case otherwise).\n\n【38】Any patient with a large forehead defect >5 cm needs a careful assessment and a radiological examination to ensure no bone involvement by the tumor being removed. Given these large double advancement flaps are still random pattern flaps, they are avoided in smokers and those with a history of radiotherapy. While dealing with large central forehead defects and the need to preserve eyebrow position, several authors have proposed the one-stage combination of advancement of a lateral U-shaped flap and a median forehead rotation flap – for reconstruction of large defects in the paramedian and lateral forehead 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. However, techniques such as these result in scars across wrinkle lines and therefore the technique of double opposed rectangular flaps we have advocated here achieves superior results. When reconstructing the lateral or middle parts of the forehead, it is important to maintain symmetry of the hairline and eyebrows. However, it is equally important to preserve the motor and sensory function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. It is especially important to note the anatomy of the facial nerve as it crosses the zygomatic arch. The temporal branch courses between the deep and superficial lobes of the parotid gland, then divides into multiple rami below the arch. It lies deep to the SMAS and superficial to the periosteum of the arch . The temporal branch then courses superiorly in close approximation with the superficial layer of temporal fascia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. When sub-periosteal dissection is done medially for cosmetic surgery endoscopic assistance is used. This is not needed at the lateral forehead and temporal region and easily performed using a small flat elevator to initiate the dissection and a larger flat elevator to free up a broader area of periosteum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Typically the advancement flap raised is anchored to the temporalis fascia to prevent any lateral ‘recoil’ post-operatively.\n\n【39】I concur with the opinion of other authors that the H-flap (or the double opposing rectangular advancement flap) is the preferred aesthetic flap for large upper forehead defects in central or lateral parts of forehead because direction of bilateral advancement is parallel to RSTLs and another advantage is upper border of flap is situated in the hairline and not visible 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. I have found this approach extremely useful in closing large defects of sizes approximating 5–6 cm of the forehead.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:39:33", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:39:49", "cost": 16.282}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:01", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:39:49", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:39:32"}

Based on diagnosis and treatment protocol for COVID-19 and clinical practice, the author considers that the TCM therapeutic thinking of COVID-19 can be from the standpoint of cold-dampness and plague Qi. Besides, unblocking and invigorating pulmonary collaterals are the key points of preventing pulmonary fibrosis, which ought to be taken throughout the treatment of COVID-19.\n\n【3】### Treating COVID-19 from the Standpoint of Cold-Dampness and Plague Qi\n\n【4】COVID-19 in China occurred at Wuhan first, when it was in winter and full of cold air. In addition, rain and humidity remained in Wuhan, which is located in the Yangtze River Valley, by the turn of 2019 and 2020. It caused the climate of Wuhan in winter to be mainly cold and humid. COVID-19 has shown strong infectiousness and epidemicity since onset, so it corresponds to the plague in TCM, and was caused by plague Qi. The clinical characteristic manifestations of COVID-19 were the same as the symptoms caused by Damp Evil such as unsurfaced fever in the early phase, lassitude and fatigue, and enlarged tongue with greasy coating. According to the climate factors, pathological factors, and clinical characteristics, it can be considered to treat COVID-19 from the stand-point of cold-dampness and plague Qi.\n\n【5】Cold-dampness and plague Qi enter through the respiratory tract and invade the lungs, because the lungs take charge of respiration. The key pathogenesis is abnormal function of the lungs and deficiency of healthy Qi with consumption of Yin. If the lungs lose their functions in dominating respiration, it will lead to abnormal formation of Qi and movements of ascending, descending, exiting, and entering Qi. In addition, the balance between inhaling fresh air from the natural environment and expelling waste air out of the body is broken. The sending down of fresh air and the ascending of waste air are impaired by the lack of coordination in dispersing and descending. If the lungs lose their functions in unblocking and regulating the water passages, it will lead to retention of excessive fluid and phlegm. Besides, the alveolar ventilation function will be decreased. If the functions of converging the vessels and governing the coordinating activities of the viscera are impaired, it will have adverse effects on regulating Qi activity and assisting the heart to propel blood. Pathological changes from abnormal function of the lungs can also aggravate abnormal physiological functions. They interact as both cause and effect. Cold-dampness and plague Qi’s incursions in lungs cause deficiency of both Qi and Yin. In addition, plague Qi is specialized in transformation. It can change into other pathological phenomena like heat, dryness, phlegm, blood-stasis, and deficiency, which can appear alone or together. Cold-dampness and plague Qi enter through the respiratory tract and it is inevitable to invade the lungs. Therefore, the location of the disease is the lungs. Some patients have gastrointestinal symptoms. It is considered as Son Organ’s Illness Involving Mother Organ, which means obstruction of lung Qi involves the spleen and stomach. Furthermore, because the five zang organs are closely related, the lung’s illness can involve other organs with the development of disease.\n\n【6】The basic therapeutic principles are strengthening healthy Qi and eliminating evil Qi, and the foremost therapeutic methods are clearing away toxic material, invigorating Qi, nourishing Yin, strengthening the spleen, and resolving dampness. Besides, the foremost purpose is to balance Yin and Yang. They are established on the basis of pathogenesis. In clinical practice, it is important to work hard for “intervening early, deeply and constantly” for “Jie Duan Niu Zhuan” (the meaning is preventing further development and taking a reverse turn) and preventing disease from worsening. In the primary stage, clearing away toxic material, strengthening the spleen, and resolving dampness are core therapies, and auxiliary therapies are invigorating Qi and nourishing Yin. It is considered to improve clinical symptoms to prevent entering the critical period. In the critical period, one is supposed to pay close attention to condition changes and perfect lab results positively. In addition, one should improve symptoms like cough and shortness of breath under the direction of foremost therapeutic methods; reduce adverse reactions of western medicine; relieve anxiety; inhibit cytokine storm, unblock collaterals, and promote blood circulation as early as possible; and enhance the body’s ability to resist against and strike evil. In the recovery period, invigorating Qi, nourishing Yin, strengthening the spleen, and resolving dampness are core therapies, and auxiliary therapy is clearing away toxic material. The purpose is to promote recovery of pulmonary functions.\n\n【7】The author made a prescription by himself as per the COVID-19 Fifth Prescription, aimed at the clinical condition of the excess of evil Qi and the deficiency of healthy Qi. The compositions are as follows: Zhi Huang Qi ( Astragali Radix ) 30 g, Bai He ( Lilium ) 25 g, Fu Xiao Mai ( Triticum Aesitivum ) 25 g, Jin Yin Hua ( Lonicera japonica Thunb ) 12 g, Lian Qiao ( Forsythiae Fructus ) 12 g, Guan Zhong ( Cyrtomii Rhizoma ) 10 g, Di Gu Pi ( Lycium Chinese Mill ) 25 g, Bai Zhi ( Angelicae Dahurica ) 15 g, Cang Zhu ( Atractylodis Rhizoma ) 15 g, Yi Yi Ren ( Coicis Semen ) 20 g, Jiu Da Huang ( Rhubard stir-fried with wine ) 6 g, Lu Lu Tong ( Fructus Liquidambaris ) 12 g. In this prescription, Jin Yin Hua ( Lonicera japonica Thunb ), Lian Qiao ( Forsythiae Fructus ), and Guan Zhong ( Cyrtomii Rhizoma ), aimed at plague Qi, can enhance the effects of heat-clearing and detoxifying together. Di Gu Pi ( Lycium Chinese Mill ) works internally and Bai Zhi ( Angelicae Dahurica ) works for expelling toxic factors externally. Taking the ratio that the dosage of purging is more than astringent can expel toxic factors externally together and prolong the effect. Lu Lu Tong ( Fructus Liquidambaris ) can dispel stagnated toxins externally by the channel. At the same time, the effect of unblocking collaterals is beneficial to prevent secondary pulmonary fibrosis. Zhi Huang Qi ( Astragali Radix ) is able to invigorate Qi dynamically which removes upward and outward. Bai He ( Lilium ) works for invigorating Qi and nourishing Yin. Fu Xiao Mai ( Triticum Aesitivum ) can nourish the Heart-Yin. Furthermore, they can complement each other as mutual supplements of Yin and Yang to have better effects of invigorating Qi and nourishing Yin. As Zhang Jingyue put it, “those who know how to tonify Yang are able to obtain Yang from Yin, because gaining Yang promotes Yin for further production and transformation; those who know how to tonify Yin are able to obtain Yin from Yang, because gaining Yin strengthens Yang for constant generation of Water and Fluid.” Da Huang ( Rhubard stir-fried with wine ) has the purgative and active effects. Cang Zhu ( Atractylodis Rhizoma ) and Yi Yi Ren ( Coicis Semen ) can strengthen the spleen, resolve dampness, and regulate the spleen and stomach. All of these herbs have the effects of clearing away toxic material, invigorating Qi, nourishing Yin, strengthening the spleen, and resolving dampness. These should be taken as 1–2 doses per day, 2–3 times, by oral or nasal feeding. Furthermore, it is suggested to adjust the dosage according to the disease features and emphases in clinical practice. When it is necessary, take with Chinese patent herbal medicine or traditional Chinese medicine injection to enhance effects based on differentiation of syndromes.\n\n【8】### Unblocking and Invigorating Pulmonary Collaterals Are the Key Points of Preventing Pulmonary Fibrosis\n\n【9】The pulmonary pathological changes of COVID-19 can be present as organization of alveolar exudates and interstitial fibrosis. It indicates that COVID-19 can result in pulmonary fibrosis, which has no specific treatment at present. Therefore, one should focus on prevention. Given the pathogenic process of COVID-19 from the standpoint of traditional Chinese medicine, it can be considered that pathological products, caused by cold-dampness and plague Qi and their transmission, impair 0 pulmonary collaterals. Therefore, obstruction and malnutrition of pulmonary collaterals cause pulmonary fibrosis. For example, cold-dampness and plague Qi’s incursions in the lungs cause deficiency of Yang Qi and retention of Yin-cold, which can result in obstruction of pulmonary collaterals; retention of damp-heat can extract Yin fluid to form phlegm, which causes airway obstruction; when heat-evil attacks Ying level and Xue level (terms of Wen Re Lun “ Treatise on Thermy and Heat Pathogenic ” by Tianshi Ye), it can impair blood collaterals; when heat-evil transfers into dry-evil, it results in consumption of Yin and Body Fluid, which leads to malnutrition of pulmonary collaterals; obstruction of lung Qi can have an impact on unblocking and regulating the water passages, thus leading to retention of phlegm, which causes obstruction of pulmonary collaterals; or accumulation of blood stasis can lead to obstruction of pulmonary collaterals; or Son Organ’s Illness Involving Mother Organ, which means obstruction of lung Qi involving the spleen and stomach, can cause malnutrition of pulmonary collaterals. Therefore, the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is that cold-dampness and plague Qi and the pathological products of COVID-19 impair pulmonary collaterals. Then, it leads to obstruction and malnutrition of pulmonary collaterals. Meanwhile, it should be noted that pulmonary fibrosis can make further development with COVID-19.\n\n【10】Because the pathogenesis of COVID-19 with pulmonary fibrosis is obstruction and malnutrition of pulmonary collaterals, unblocking and invigorating pulmonary collaterals are taken as the basic therapeutic principles to prevent pulmonary fibrosis. Besides, one should focus on prevention. However, pulmonary fibrosis can make further development with COVID-19, so it is supposed to put prevention of pulmonary fibrosis into treatment process of COVID-19. The core therapeutic methods to treat COVID-19 are clearing away toxic material, invigorating Qi, nourishing Yin, strengthening the spleen, and resolving dampness, while unblocking and invigorating pulmonary collaterals positively. The specific therapeutic method is chosen as per the different phase characteristics. For example, one is supposed to clear away heat and toxic material for the stagnancy of heat-toxic case; one is suitable to resolve dampness and clear away toxic material for the retention of turbid dampness case; and one is suggested to dissolve blood stasis and detoxify for the stagnancy of blood stasis case. All these methods can unblock pulmonary collaterals. On the other hand, one is suitable to invigorate Qi and clear away toxic material for the Qi-deficiency case; one can nourish Yin and clear away toxic material for the Yin-deficiency case; and one is suggested to strengthen the spleen and clear away toxic material for the spleen-deficiency case. These methods can invigorate pulmonary collaterals. The condition is so complex that specific therapeutic methods can also be taken together. For instance, if a person has deficiency of Yin caused by heat-retention and stagnancy of phlegm and blood stasis, it is suggested to clear away heat and nourish Yin, cooperated with eliminating phlegm and dissolving blood stasis. The combination of unblocking and invigorating pulmonary collaterals can enhance the targeted effect of preventing pulmonary fibrosis.\n\n【11】(Zhixu Yang, Jinlin Tong)", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【11】(Zhixu Yang, Jinlin Tong)", "content": "【0】Discussion on COVID-19\n======================\n\n【1】Zhixu Yang\n\n【2】As a member of the first national medical team of TCM, the author came to Wuhan on 01/25/2020 and took part in the treatment work of severe and critical patients at the Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital.

Phimosis. — Circumcision performed within the first  删除换行1: few days of life confers protection against malignancy. This  删除换行1: is an accepted fact and it is for this reason that carcinoma of  删除换行1: the penis is virtually unknown among Jews (in whom ritual  删除换行1: circumcision is performed very early) and it is extremely rare  删除换行1: among Muslims (in whom circumcision is performed  删除换行1: between 4 and 10 years). Obviously carcinoma is more  删除换行1: common in men who have not been circumcised in early  删除换行1: infancy. Presumably, circumcision protects against  删除换行1: tumourogenesis by preventing accumulation of smegma and  删除换行1: minimising the tendency to irritation and infections.\n\n【4】2. Balanoposthitis.— Chronic balanoposthitis or recurrent  删除换行1: attacks of balanoposthitis predispose to carcinoma.\n\n【5】3. Condyloma acuminata or penile warts are often  删除换行1: considered to be a premalignant condition.\n\n【6】4. Leukoplakia of the glans penis is also considered to be a  删除换行1: premalignant condition. In this condition areas of white,  删除换行1: boggy epithelium are seen. The leukoplakia resembles  删除换行1: patches of greyish-white paint. It is a painless condition. \n\n【7】There is evidence of hyperkeratosis and acanthosis  删除换行1: (thickening of the underlying epidermis).\n\n【8】5. Paget's disease.— This is an area of chronic, red eczema  删除换行1: of the glans penis or inside of the prepuce. The lesion oozes  删除换行1: and crust over. Paget's disease is the intraepithelial stage of  删除换行1: squamous cell carcinoma, histologically almost similar to that  删除换行1: occurs in the nipple of the breast. This disease often escapes  删除换行1: detection until carcinoma has developed. Treatment is  删除换行1: diathermy excision.\n\n【9】6. Erythroplasia of Queyrat.— It causes a dark red, flat  删除换行1: but slightly indurated patch on the glans penis or inner side  删除换行1: of the prepuce. It may be slightly raised or nodular. This  删除换行1: condition occurs most often in the penis. But it may occur  删除换行1: on the vulva and in the mouth.\n\n【10】7. Bowen's disease — is a curious form of carcinoma in  删除换行1: situ. It is only seen in patients over 35 years of age. It is  删除换行1: prone to involve the shaft of the penis. It appears as a  删除换行1: thickened, opaque plaque with shallow ulceration and  删除换行1: crusting. Over the span of years these lesions may become  删除换行1: invasive and are transformed into characteristic squamous  删除换行1: cell carcinoma.\n\n【11】8. Syphilis and gonorrhoea have been implicated as  删除换行1: initiative factors, but continuing studies suggest that these  删除换行1: are not predisposing factors.\n\n【12】Pathoiogy.—-\n\n【13】The lesion usually begins on the glans or inner surface of  删除换行1: the prepuce near the coronal sulcus. The first change is a small  删除换行1: area of epithelial thickening accompanied by grey and \n\n【14】Assuring of the mucosal surface. Gradually an elevated  删除换行1: leukoplakic patch is produced which usually ulcerates when  删除换行1: a diameter of approximately 1 cm is reached.\n\n【15】Macroscopically two varieties are usually seen — (i) \n\n【16】Ulcerative variety, which is commoner and (ii) Papilliferous  删除换行1: variety.\n\n【17】(i) In ulcerative variety the lesion presents as a large  删除换行1: characteristic malignant ulcer having necrotic secondarily  删除换行1: infected floors with ragged, irregular and heaped-up margins. \n\n【18】In advanced cases the ulcero-invasive disease is seen which  删除换行1: has almost destroyed the entire tip of the penis and a portion  删除换行1: of the shaft.\n\n【19】(ii) The second papilliferous variety simulates the  删除换行1: condyloma and gradually progresses to form a cauliflower删除8：<u>￾</u>like, fungating mass. As this tumour enlarges, it undergoes  删除换行1: central ulceration and may be transformed into ulcerative  删除换行1: lesion.\n\n【20】Microscopically both the ulcerative and papilliferous  删除换行1: lesions are squamous cell carcinomas exactly resembling those  删除换行1: that occur elsewhere on the skin surface.\n\n【21】Spread.—\n\n【22】(a) Direct spread.— For quite a long time the growth is  删除换行1: limited to the glans and inner surface of the prepuce. \n\n【23】Gradually the foreskin is infiltrated, similarly more and more  删除换行1: areas of glans will be involved.\n\n【24】Direct spread to the body of the penis does not take place  删除换行1: before 6 months to 1 year, as the fascial sheath of the corpora  删除换行1: cavernosa acts as a barrier. Once this barrier is broken, the  删除换行1: growth rapidly spreads along the shaft of the penis.\n\n【25】Peculiarly enough the urethra is not infdtrated by  删除换行1: carcinoma.\n\n【26】(b) Lymphatic spread.— As squamous cell carcinoma  删除换行1: anywhere in the body, lymphatic spread is early by  删除换行1: embolization. Lymphatics from the prepuce and glans penis  删除换行1: drain into the superficial inguinal lymph nodes of both sides. \n\n【27】Some of the lymphatics from the glans drain into the deep  删除换行1: inguinal lymph nodes. So enlargement of the inguinal lymph  删除换行1: nodes is often seen alongwith carcinoma of the penis. But  删除换行1: such enlargement may be simply inflammatory and not  删除换行1: metastatic.\n\n【28】Once the shaft of the penis is involved, the iliac group of  删除换行1: lymph nodes may be involved. Moreover the efferents from  删除换行1: the inguinal nodes drain into the external iliac nodes, which  删除换行1: are also involved eventually.\n\n【29】(c) Blood spread.— This spread occurs late and rarely. \n\n【30】Such spread occurs when the growth is anaplastic and is  删除换行1: more virulent. Inspite of rich blood supply of the penis and 删除换行1: the many possible avenues of spread via pelvic veins and  删除换行1: paravertebral system, visceral metastases are rare. Distant  删除换行1: metastasis occurs in fewer than 10% of patients and they  删除换行1: appear most commonly in the lungs, liver, bones and the  删除换行1: brain. Prognosis is extremely poor.\n\n【31】Clinical features.—\n\n【32】PHIMOSIS\n\n【33】Age.— Though carcinoma of penis commonly affects  删除换行1: individuals of the middle or old age, yet it can occur in the 删除换行1: young. About 40% of the sufferers are under 40 years of age. \n\n【34】HISTORY.—\n\n【35】(i) Patients often present with a lump or an ulcer  删除换行1: representing the papilliferous or ulcerative variety of the  删除换行1: carcinoma of penis respectively.\n\n【36】(ii) Sometimes patients present with mild irritation and  删除换行1: purulent discharge from the prepuce. Such cases require  删除换行1: dorsal slit to detect the growth.\n\n【37】(iii) If the patient ignores the previous symptoms, they  删除换行1: may present afterwards with blood stained foul discharge  删除换行1: from the prepuce or the growth is seen which has eroded  删除换行1: the prepuce.\n\n【38】(iv) Carcinoma as such is a painless condition. But if  删除换行1: there is too much of associated infection, the lesion may be  删除换行1: painful.\n\n【39】(v) In more than half the cases the inguinal lymph nodes  删除换行1: are enlarged. In half of these cases it is due to inflammation  删除换行1: and not metastasis.\n\n【40】LOCAL EXAMINATION reveals the carcinomatous lesion  删除换行1: which may be papilliferous or ulcerative. The gross features  删除换行1: have been described in the section of pathology. It must be  删除换行1: remembered that presence of phimosis may prevent adequate  删除换行1: visualisation of the tumour and the only sign remains, is a  删除换行1: firm, palpable lump in the region of the glans. Dorsal slit  删除换行1: and biopsy, performed in full aseptic environment of  删除换行1: operation theatre will only confirm the diagnosis.\n\n【41】Palpation of inguinal lymph nodes is an integral part of  删除换行1: physical examination and about 60% of patients present  删除换行1: with inguinal lymph node enlargement. However half of  删除换行1: these cases are reactive enlargement due to inflammatory  删除换行1: response and the lymph nodes are firm and rubbery in  删除换行1: consistency. When the lymph nodes are hard and may be  删除换行1: matted, lymph node metastasis should be suspected. When  删除换行1: untreated, the whole glans may be replaced by a fungating  删除换行1: offensive mass. In very late and untreated cases the inguinal  删除换行1: lymph nodes may fungate through the skin of the groin and  删除换行1: may erode the underlying femoral vein or the artery to cause  删除换行1: torrential haemorrhage and even death.\n\n【42】By nature carcinoma of the penis is a slow growing and 删除换行1: locally metastasising lesion.\n\n【43】Staging of cancer of penis.— Cancer of the penis usually 删除换行1: arises on the glans or the foreskin (prepuce) and spreads  删除换行1: locally. When it invades the vascular spaces of the spongy  删除换行1: tissue it may disseminate in the veins. In the beginning this  删除换行1: cancer always tends to spread by lymphatics, invading first  删除换行1: those in the inguinal region and later on those in the pelvis.\n\n【44】Stage I.— The cancer is confined to the glans or foreskin.\n\n【45】Stage II.— The tumour invades the shaft of the penis.\n\n【46】Stage III.— Inguinal lymph nodes are involved and  删除换行1: operable.\n\n【47】State IV.— The disease is disseminated.\n\n【48】Special Investigations.—\n\n【49】(a) Routine blood examinations are of some help to know  删除换行1: if the patient is anaemic or not. Leukocytosis, a frequent  删除换行1: finding, is usually secondary to local infection. There are  删除换行1: some instances of hypercalcaemia with localised carcinoma  删除换行1: of the penis, which is often cured by excision of the tumour.\n\n【50】(b) X-ray findings.— Lymphangiography is of some help  删除换行1: to know if the inguinal or pelvic lymph nodes have been  删除换行1: involved by the disease.\n\n【51】(c) CT Scanning.— This non-invasive technique is  删除换行1: probably better to assess involvement of pelvic and  删除换行1: retroperitoneal lymph nodes with the disease.\n\n【52】SYMPTOMS.—\n\n【53】A. TREATMENT OF THE PRIMARY—There are two  删除换行1: methods of treatment for primary growth — 1. Radiotherapy  删除换行1: and 2. Surgery.\n\n【54】1. RADIOTHERAPY.— This is indicated for small and  删除换行1: well differentiated growths limited to the glans penis.\n\n【55】Its advantages are (i) that the result is same or even better  删除换行1: than surgery and (ii) it avoids mutilating operation.\n\n【56】Its disadvantages are (i) it may cause bad scarring which  删除换行1: result in painful erection and (ii) it may cause postoperative  删除换行1: sterility.\n\n【57】It is contraindicated in (i) big growth, (ii) growth  删除换行1: involving the shaft and (iii) anaplastic tumour.\n\n【58】If not already performed a dorsal slit should be done to  删除换行1: provide proper exposure of the growth to the radiotherapy.\n\n【59】Methods of radiotherapy are :\n\n【60】(a) Implantation of flexible radioactive tantalum wires\n\n【61】— which offer a total dose of 6000 rads in 5 to 7 days.\n\n【62】(b) Medium or high voltage X-ray, known as megavoltage \n\n【63】X-ray, which offers 5000 to 6000 rads in divided doses in 5  删除换行1: weeks.\n\n【64】(c) Surface radiations may be given by radium mould  删除换行1: applicator worn intermittently or continuously, so that it  删除换行1: can offer 5000 to 6000 rads in 7 to 10 days.\n\n【65】(d) Good results have been claimed with the use of either  删除换行1: radium needles or iridium wire implants.\n\n【66】However even though results of radiotherapy has been  删除换行1: satisfactory in this type of carcinoma, yet the slow rate ofPENIS 261 删除换行1: regression of the tumour, the weeks of discomfort while the  删除换行1: treatment is on are the major disadvantages which the patients  删除换行1: dislike.\n\n【67】2. SURGERY.— This is indicated —\n\n【68】(i) In anaplastic growth.\n\n【69】(ii) In case of a big growth.\n\n【70】(iii) When there is infiltration to the shaft of the penis.\n\n【71】(iv) When the radiotherapy has failed.\n\n【72】Methods of surgery are :\n\n【73】(a) Partial amputation •— used for distal growth limited  删除换行1: to glans penis.\n\n【74】(b) Total amputation of penis — performed in (i) advanced  删除换行1: case involving the shaft of the penis and (ii) in case of  删除换行1: anaplastic lesion.\n\n【75】Partial amputation of the penis.— This operation is 删除换行1: indicated when the growth is confined to the glans and prepuce 删除换行1: only and has not spread to the body of the penis.\n\n【76】A fine catheter is applied round the base of the penis as a  删除换行1: tourniquet. A long ventral flap is made whose breadth is  删除换行1: equal to the half of the circumference of the penis and the  删除换行1: length is equal to the diameter of the penis. A short flap Vi 删除换行1: inch long is  删除换行1: made on  删除换行1: the dorsal  删除换行1: aspect. The  删除换行1: flaps are  删除换行1: dissected  删除换行1: back to  删除换行1: their bases. \n\n【77】The corpus  删除换行1: spongiosum  删除换行1: is isolated  删除换行1: from the 删除换行1: corpora cavernosa by inserting a fine scalpel on either side of  删除换行1: the corpus spongiosum and divided Vi inch distal to the  删除换行1: proposed level of section of the corpora cavernosa. The cor删除8：<u>￾</u>pora cavernosa are now divided at the level of the base of the  删除换行1: flaps. The tourniquet is now removed and the bleeding points  删除换行1: are secured by ligatures. A small opening is made in the  删除换行1: ventral flap and the corpus spongiosum is brought out  删除换行1: through the opening. The two flaps are now sutured to删除8：<u>￾</u>gether at the dorsum of the penis. The sutures should be  删除换行1: well spaced for adequate drainage of the haematoma, which  删除换行1: may be formed beneath the flap. The end of the emerging  删除换行1: urethra is split for a distance of 1 cm and each half is su删除8：<u>￾</u>tured to the skin of the flap. This is done to prevent subse删除8：<u>￾</u>quent stricture formation. A self-retaining catheter is then  删除换行1: introduced.\n\n【78】On first three postoperative days, dressing should be done  删除换行1: daily. The catheter is removed on the 5th day.\n\n【79】Total amputation of the penis.— This operation is indicated 删除换行1: when the malignant tumour has involved the body of the penis.\n\n【80】删除3：<u>Fig. 20.7 & 20.8. — Steps of operation of partial  删除换行1: amputation of penis.</u>\n\n【81】The patient is placed in lithotomy-Trendelenburg  删除换行1: position. A metal bougie is passed per urethra. A racket删除8：<u>￾</u>shaped incision is made encircling the base of the penis and  删除换行1: is carried vertically downwards in the midline of the scrotum  删除换行1: to the perineum upto a point 1 inch in front of the anus  删除换行1: . By dissection exactly in the midline the scrotum  删除换行1: is split into two halves. The penis is then mobilised by  删除换行1: dividing the suspensory ligament and the dorsal vessels are  删除换行1: secured. The perineal part of the incision is more deepened  删除换行1: and the margins are retracted to expose the bulbous part of  删除换行1: the urethra and the two crura . The crura are  删除换行1: detached from the ischio-pubic rami with the help of a  删除换行1: raspatory The bougie is removed and the bulb of the urethra  删除换行1: is divided about 2 inches distal to the perineal membrane. \n\n【82】The urethra is dissected out of the muscular tissues of the  删除换行1: bulb.\n\n【83】删除3：<u>Fig. 20.9.— Shows  删除换行1: incision for total  删除换行1: amputation of penis.</u>\n\n【84】删除3：<u>Fig. 20.10.— Operation of total  删除换行1: amputation of penis is being performed. </u>\n\n【85】The two crura and the bulbous part of the  删除换行1: penis are exposed.\n\n【86】删除3：<u>Fig. 20.11.— The flaps are sutured. A drain is given and a self删除8：<u>￾</u>retaining catheter has been introduced through the urethra.</u>\n\n【87】The wound is repaired by suturing the two flaps in the  删除换行1: midline. A small drain is left at this part. The posterior part  删除换行1: of the incision is closed round the stump of the urethra. The  删除换行1: urethral stump is split into 2 halves which are sutured above  删除换行1: to overlap the skin margins.

When it invades the vascular spaces of the spongy  删除换行1: tissue it may disseminate in the veins. In the beginning this  删除换行1: cancer always tends to spread by lymphatics, invading first  删除换行1: those in the inguinal region and later on those in the pelvis.\n\n【44】Stage I.— The cancer is confined to the glans or foreskin.\n\n【45】Stage II.— The tumour invades the shaft of the penis.\n\n【46】Stage III.— Inguinal lymph nodes are involved and  删除换行1: operable.\n\n【47】State IV.— The disease is disseminated.\n\n【48】Special Investigations.—\n\n【49】(a) Routine blood examinations are of some help to know  删除换行1: if the patient is anaemic or not.

RADIOTHERAPY.— This is indicated for small and  删除换行1: well differentiated growths limited to the glans penis.\n\n【55】Its advantages are (i) that the result is same or even better  删除换行1: than surgery and (ii) it avoids mutilating operation.\n\n【56】Its disadvantages are (i) it may cause bad scarring which  删除换行1: result in painful erection and (ii) it may cause postoperative  删除换行1: sterility.\n\n【57】It is contraindicated in (i) big growth, (ii) growth  删除换行1: involving the shaft and (iii) anaplastic tumour.\n\n【58】If not already performed a dorsal slit should be done to  删除换行1: provide proper exposure of the growth to the radiotherapy.\n\n【59】Methods of radiotherapy are :\n\n【60】(a) Implantation of flexible radioactive tantalum wires\n\n【61】— which offer a total dose of 6000 rads in 5 to 7 days.\n\n【62】(b) Medium or high voltage X-ray, known as megavoltage \n\n【63】X-ray, which offers 5000 to 6000 rads in divided doses in 5  删除换行1: weeks.\n\n【64】(c) Surface radiations may be given by radium mould  删除换行1: applicator worn intermittently or continuously, so that it  删除换行1: can offer 5000 to 6000 rads in 7 to 10 days.\n\n【65】(d) Good results have been claimed with the use of either  删除换行1: radium needles or iridium wire implants.\n\n【66】However even though results of radiotherapy has been  删除换行1: satisfactory in this type of carcinoma, yet the slow rate ofPENIS 261 删除换行1: regression of the tumour, the weeks of discomfort while the  删除换行1: treatment is on are the major disadvantages which the patients  删除换行1: dislike.\n\n【67】2. SURGERY.— This is indicated —\n\n【68】(i) In anaplastic growth.\n\n【69】(ii) In case of a big growth.\n\n【70】(iii) When there is infiltration to the shaft of the penis.\n\n【71】(iv) When the radiotherapy has failed.\n\n【72】Methods of surgery are :\n\n【73】(a) Partial amputation •— used for distal growth limited  删除换行1: to glans penis.\n\n【74】(b) Total amputation of penis — performed in (i) advanced  删除换行1: case involving the shaft of the penis and (ii) in case of  删除换行1: anaplastic lesion.\n\n【75】Partial amputation of the penis.— This operation is 删除换行1: indicated when the growth is confined to the glans and prepuce 删除换行1: only and has not spread to the body of the penis.\n\n【76】A fine catheter is applied round the base of the penis as a  删除换行1: tourniquet. A long ventral flap is made whose breadth is  删除换行1: equal to the half of the circumference of the penis and the  删除换行1: length is equal to the diameter of the penis. A short flap Vi 删除换行1: inch long is  删除换行1: made on  删除换行1: the dorsal  删除换行1: aspect. The  删除换行1: flaps are  删除换行1: dissected  删除换行1: back to  删除换行1: their bases. \n\n【77】The corpus  删除换行1: spongiosum  删除换行1: is isolated  删除换行1: from the 删除换行1: corpora cavernosa by inserting a fine scalpel on either side of  删除换行1: the corpus spongiosum and divided Vi inch distal to the  删除换行1: proposed level of section of the corpora cavernosa. The cor删除8：<u>￾</u>pora cavernosa are now divided at the level of the base of the  删除换行1: flaps. The tourniquet is now removed and the bleeding points  删除换行1: are secured by ligatures. A small opening is made in the  删除换行1: ventral flap and the corpus spongiosum is brought out  删除换行1: through the opening. The two flaps are now sutured to删除8：<u>￾</u>gether at the dorsum of the penis. The sutures should be  删除换行1: well spaced for adequate drainage of the haematoma, which  删除换行1: may be formed beneath the flap. The end of the emerging  删除换行1: urethra is split for a distance of 1 cm and each half is su删除8：<u>￾</u>tured to the skin of the flap. This is done to prevent subse删除8：<u>￾</u>quent stricture formation. A self-retaining catheter is then  删除换行1: introduced.\n\n【78】On first three postoperative days, dressing should be done  删除换行1: daily.

By dissection exactly in the midline the scrotum  删除换行1: is split into two halves. The penis is then mobilised by  删除换行1: dividing the suspensory ligament and the dorsal vessels are  删除换行1: secured.

Its incidence however fluctuates widely among  删除换行1: various geographic locations and its incidence is more in </u>\n\n【2】Aetiology.—\n\n【3】1. Phimosis. — Circumcision performed within the first  删除换行1: few days of life confers protection against malignancy. This  删除换行1: is an accepted fact and it is for this reason that carcinoma of  删除换行1: the penis is virtually unknown among Jews (in whom ritual  删除换行1: circumcision is performed very early) and it is extremely rare  删除换行1: among Muslims (in whom circumcision is performed  删除换行1: between 4 and 10 years). Obviously carcinoma is more  删除换行1: common in men who have not been circumcised in early  删除换行1: infancy. Presumably, circumcision protects against  删除换行1: tumourogenesis by preventing accumulation of smegma and  删除换行1: minimising the tendency to irritation and infections.\n\n【4】2. Balanoposthitis.— Chronic balanoposthitis or recurrent  删除换行1: attacks of balanoposthitis predispose to carcinoma.\n\n【5】3. Condyloma acuminata or penile warts are often  删除换行1: considered to be a premalignant condition.\n\n【6】4. Leukoplakia of the glans penis is also considered to be a  删除换行1: premalignant condition. In this condition areas of white,  删除换行1: boggy epithelium are seen. The leukoplakia resembles  删除换行1: patches of greyish-white paint. It is a painless condition. \n\n【7】There is evidence of hyperkeratosis and acanthosis  删除换行1: (thickening of the underlying epidermis).\n\n【8】5. Paget's disease.— This is an area of chronic, red eczema  删除换行1: of the glans penis or inside of the prepuce. The lesion oozes  删除换行1: and crust over. Paget's disease is the intraepithelial stage of  删除换行1: squamous cell carcinoma, histologically almost similar to that  删除换行1: occurs in the nipple of the breast. This disease often escapes  删除换行1: detection until carcinoma has developed. Treatment is  删除换行1: diathermy excision.\n\n【9】6. Erythroplasia of Queyrat.— It causes a dark red, flat  删除换行1: but slightly indurated patch on the glans penis or inner side  删除换行1: of the prepuce. It may be slightly raised or nodular. This  删除换行1: condition occurs most often in the penis. But it may occur  删除换行1: on the vulva and in the mouth.\n\n【10】7. Bowen's disease — is a curious form of carcinoma in  删除换行1: situ. It is only seen in patients over 35 years of age. It is  删除换行1: prone to involve the shaft of the penis. It appears as a  删除换行1: thickened, opaque plaque with shallow ulceration and  删除换行1: crusting. Over the span of years these lesions may become  删除换行1: invasive and are transformed into characteristic squamous  删除换行1: cell carcinoma.\n\n【11】8. Syphilis and gonorrhoea have been implicated as  删除换行1: initiative factors, but continuing studies suggest that these  删除换行1: are not predisposing factors.\n\n【12】Pathoiogy.—-\n\n【13】The lesion usually begins on the glans or inner surface of  删除换行1: the prepuce near the coronal sulcus. The first change is a small  删除换行1: area of epithelial thickening accompanied by grey and \n\n<mark>【14】Assuring of the </mark>mucosal surface. Gradually an elevated  删除换行1: leukoplakic patch is produced which usually ulcerates when  删除换行1: a diameter of approximately 1 cm is reached.\n\n【15】Macroscopically two varieties are usually seen — (i) \n\n【16】Ulcerative variety, which is commoner and (ii) Papilliferous  删除换行1: variety.\n\n【17】(i) In ulcerative variety the lesion presents as a large  删除换行1: characteristic malignant ulcer having necrotic secondarily  删除换行1: infected floors with ragged, irregular and heaped-up margins. \n\n【18】In advanced cases the ulcero-invasive disease is seen which  删除换行1: has almost destroyed the entire tip of the penis and a portion  删除换行1: of the shaft.\n\n【19】(ii) The second papilliferous variety simulates the  删除换行1: condyloma and gradually progresses to form a cauliflower删除8：<u>￾</u>like, fungating mass. As this tumour enlarges, it undergoes  删除换行1: central ulceration and may be transformed into ulcerative  删除换行1: lesion.\n\n【20】Microscopically both the ulcerative and papilliferous  删除换行1: lesions are squamous cell carcinomas exactly resembling those  删除换行1: that occur elsewhere on the skin surface.\n\n【21】Spread.—\n\n【22】(a) Direct spread.— For quite a long time the growth is  删除换行1: limited to the glans and inner surface of the prepuce. \n\n【23】Gradually the foreskin is infiltrated, similarly more and more  删除换行1: areas of glans will be involved.\n\n【24】Direct spread to the body of the penis does not take place  删除换行1: before 6 months to 1 year, as the fascial sheath of the corpora  删除换行1: cavernosa acts as a barrier. Once this barrier is broken, the  删除换行1: growth rapidly spreads along the shaft of the penis.\n\n【25】Peculiarly enough the urethra is not infdtrated by  删除换行1: carcinoma.\n\n【26】(b) Lymphatic spread.— As squamous cell carcinoma  删除换行1: anywhere in the body, lymphatic spread is early by  删除换行1: embolization. Lymphatics from the prepuce and glans penis  删除换行1: drain into the superficial inguinal lymph nodes of both sides. \n\n【27】Some of the lymphatics from the glans drain into the deep  删除换行1: inguinal lymph nodes. So enlargement of the inguinal lymph  删除换行1: nodes is often seen alongwith carcinoma of the penis. But  删除换行1: such enlargement may be simply inflammatory and not  删除换行1: metastatic.\n\n【28】Once the shaft of the penis is involved, the iliac group of  删除换行1: lymph nodes may be involved. Moreover the efferents from  删除换行1: the inguinal nodes drain into the external iliac nodes, which  删除换行1: are also involved eventually.\n\n【29】(c) Blood spread.— This spread occurs late and rarely. \n\n【30】Such spread occurs when the growth is anaplastic and is  删除换行1: more virulent. Inspite of rich blood supply of the penis and 删除换行1: the many possible avenues of spread via pelvic veins and  删除换行1: paravertebral system, visceral metastases are rare. Distant  删除换行1: metastasis occurs in fewer than 10% of patients and they  删除换行1: appear most commonly in the lungs, liver, bones and the  删除换行1: brain. Prognosis is extremely poor.\n\n【31】Clinical features.—\n\n【32】PHIMOSIS\n\n【33】Age.— Though carcinoma of penis commonly affects  删除换行1: individuals of the middle or old age, yet it can occur in the 删除换行1: young. About 40% of the sufferers are under 40 years of age. \n\n【34】HISTORY.—\n\n【35】(i) Patients often present with a lump or an ulcer  删除换行1: representing the papilliferous or ulcerative variety of the  删除换行1: carcinoma of penis respectively.\n\n【36】(ii) Sometimes patients present with mild irritation and  删除换行1: purulent discharge from the prepuce. Such cases require  删除换行1: dorsal slit to detect the growth.\n\n【37】(iii) If the patient ignores the previous symptoms, they  删除换行1: may present afterwards with blood stained foul discharge  删除换行1: from the prepuce or the growth is seen which has eroded  删除换行1: the prepuce.\n\n【38】(iv) Carcinoma as such is a painless condition. But if  删除换行1: there is too much of associated infection, the lesion may be  删除换行1: painful.\n\n【39】(v) In more than half the cases the inguinal lymph nodes  删除换行1: are enlarged. In half of these cases it is due to inflammation  删除换行1: and not metastasis.\n\n【40】LOCAL EXAMINATION reveals the carcinomatous lesion  删除换行1: which may be papilliferous or ulcerative. The gross features  删除换行1: have been described in the section of pathology. It must be  删除换行1: remembered that presence of phimosis may prevent adequate  删除换行1: visualisation of the tumour and the only sign remains, is a  删除换行1: firm, palpable lump in the region of the glans. Dorsal slit  删除换行1: and biopsy, performed in full aseptic environment of  删除换行1: operation theatre will only confirm the diagnosis.\n\n【41】Palpation of inguinal lymph nodes is an integral part of  删除换行1: physical examination and about 60% of patients present  删除换行1: with inguinal lymph node enlargement. However half of  删除换行1: these cases are reactive enlargement due to inflammatory  删除换行1: response and the lymph nodes are firm and rubbery in  删除换行1: consistency. When the lymph nodes are hard and may be  删除换行1: matted, lymph node metastasis should be suspected. When  删除换行1: untreated, the whole glans may be replaced by a fungating  删除换行1: offensive mass. In very late and untreated cases the inguinal  删除换行1: lymph nodes may fungate through the skin of the groin and  删除换行1: may erode the underlying femoral vein or the artery to cause  删除换行1: torrential haemorrhage and even death.\n\n【42】By nature carcinoma of the penis is a slow growing and 删除换行1: locally metastasising lesion.\n\n【43】Staging of cancer of penis.— Cancer of the penis usually 删除换行1: arises on the glans or the foreskin (prepuce) and spreads  删除换行1: locally.

Abdominal examination revealed hepatosplenomegaly and urine showed presence of heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate.\n\n【1】Enzyme assay in fibroblast reveals deficiency of L-iduronidase. Attending pediatrician came to a conclusion that child is suffering with mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS).\n\n【2】QUESTIONS\n\n【3】Q.1. What may be the possible type of mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) in this case?\n\n【4】Q.2. Explain the genetic cause and mode of inheritance of this disease.\n\n【5】Q.3. What are the other MPS (mucopolysaccharidosis)?\n\n【6】Q.4. What is the treatment in such case?\n\n【7】Explanations\n\n【8】Ans.1. This child is suffering with MPS I (Hurler syndrome) as diagnosed by deficiency of L-iduronidase in the fibroblast. Due to deficiency of this enzyme the glycosaminoglycans which are accumulated in lysosomes are heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate which comes out in the urine.\n\n【9】MPS is heterogenous group of disorder where various mucopolysaccharides are accumulated in lysosome in tissues like heart， respiratory system， bones， joints and central nervous system due to deficiency of one or other enzyme involved in degradation of these compounds in lysosome. Such abnormal accumulation of these compounds results in relevant clinical manifestation. Corneal clo macrudioglong ssia andwith spaced dentition are characteristic finding .\n\n【10】Definitive diagnosis is usually possible through enzymatenzyic asme saysin c of tultuhe dred efecfibrtiveoblasts or leukocytes.\n\n【11】删除3：<u>Fig. 2： Macroglossia and spaced dentition in a child with Hurler syndrome</u>\n\n【12】Ans.2. MPS I is autosomal recessive disorder which is due to mutation of gene IDUA located at short arm of chromosome 4 (4p16.3). This results in deficiency of enzyme alpha-L-iduronidase.\n\n【13】It was first described by Gertrude Hurler in 1919 and later the milder form of the disease was described by ophthalmologist Dr Scheie in 1962. Depending upon the severity of the disorder type I MPS has three subtypes：\n\n【14】MPS I H： Most severe\n\n【15】MPS I H/S： Intermediate form\n\n【16】MPS I S： Mild form\n\n【17】Ans.3. There are total 7 types of MPS.

An asymptomatic 16-year-old whose grandfather died of a heart attack at age 72\n\n【5】Answer: 29.1 B. Any patient with a diastolic murmur, grade 3/6 or louder systolic murmur, murmur suggestive of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or signs of Marfan syndrome should be evaluated by a cardiologist prior to clearance to participate in athletics. The murmur of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy typically gets louder with maneuvers that reduce preload, such as the Valsalva maneuver or when standing.\n\n【6】Question: 29.2 A 15-year-old girl is brought in by her mother for a wellness clearance for sports participation at school. She would also like to discuss the addition of birth control. When the mother leaves the room you learn that the girl is not sexually active but wants to start OCPs because she has heard they help with acne and her friends have seen improvement. She does not drink alcohol or smoke and is in honors classes in the ninth grade. She plays on the junior varsity softball team and eats most days in the school cafeteria. Which of the following is recommended routinely in the Guidelines for Adolescent Preventive Services and should be performed at this time?\n\n【7】A. Annual complete physical examinations between the ages of 11 and 21 years\n\n【8】B. Periodic screening for drug use with a urine toxicology test\n\n【9】C. Cholesterol testing\n\n【10】D. Annual screening for hypertension\n\n【11】Answer: 29.2 D. GAPS recommend annual screening for hypertension by blood pressure measurement in all adolescents. Complete physical examinations are advised routinely, once during early adolescence, once in midadolescence, and once in late adolescence, as well as more often when indicated. Lipid screening should be targeted to those who are at high risk based on personal or family history. Routine toxicology screening is not recommended.\n\n【12】Question: 29.3 A 17-year-old adolescent boy reports that he has been sexually active with two female partners in the past year. He has used condoms “sometimes, but not always.” He is asymptomatic and has a normal physical examination. Which of the following tests would be recommended to screen him for gonorrhea and Chlamydia ?\n\n【13】A. Urethral swab.\n\n【14】B. Serum antibodies to Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis .\n\n【15】C. Urine for nucleic acid amplification.\n\n【16】D. No screening is recommended.\nAnswer: 29.3 C. Urine for nucleic acid amplification is recommended as screening for presumptive gonorrhea or Chlamydia in sexually active males. A urethral swab is only appropriate for diagnostic testing in a male who has a urethral discharge.\n\n【17】CLINICAL PEARLS\n\n【18】 Adolescents tend to see physicians irregularly. Take the time at each visit, no matter what the chief complaint is, to review health maintenance issues.\n\n【19】 True contraindications to participation in all sports are rare. Almost everyone should be able to participate in some form of athletic activity.\n\n【20】 Universal adolescent vaccination with meningococcal vaccine became a recommendation in 2005; unvaccinated adolescents and teens should be offered vaccination routinely.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:23:36", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:23:48", "cost": 12.178}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:01", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:23:48", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:23:35"}

The patient was noted to be anemic on her prenatal screen with a hemoglobin level of9.5 g/dL and a mean corpuscular volume (MCV)of70 fL. On examination， her blood pressure (BP) is 100/60 mm Hg， heart rate (HR) 80 beats per minute (bpm)， and she is afebrile. The thyroid gland appears normal on palpation. The heart and lung examinations are unremarkable. The fundus is at the umbilicus. The fetal heart tones are in the 140-to 150-bpm range. The evaluation of the anemia includes： ferritin level： 90 mcg/L (normal30-100)； serum iron： 140 meg/dL (normal 50-150)； hemoglobin electrophoresis：Hb A1 of95% and Hb A2 of5.5%(normal2.2%-3.5%).\n\n【1】What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【2】What is the underlying mechanism?\n\n【3】What is the significance ofthe anemia to the pregnancy?\n\n【4】ANSWERS TO CASE 2：\n\n【5】Anemia in Pregnancy (Thalassemia Trait)\n\n【6】Summary： A 29-year-old G2P1 woman at 20 weeks'gestation is being seen for pre-natal care. On examination， her BP is 100/ 60， HR 80 bpm， and temperature is normal. Her hemoglobin level is 9.5 g/dL， with an elevated Hb A2 level.\n\n【7】Most likely diagnosis： Anemia due to β-thalassemia minor.\n\n【8】Underlying mechanism： Decreased p-globin chain production.\n\n【9】Significance of the anemia to pregnancy： Although there is a small risk of intra-uterine growth restriction， the pregnancy is usually uncomplicated. Because there is risk of the baby developing thalassemia major， genetic testing and eval-uation of the father of the baby should be offered.\n\n【10】ANALYSIS\n\n【11】Objectives\n\n【12】1\\. Know that iron deficiency and thalassemia are common causes of microcytic anemia.\n\n【13】2\\. Understand that deficiency of folate and vitamin B.， are causes of macrocytic anemia.\n\n【14】3\\. Know the diagnostic approach to anemia in pregnancy.\n\n【15】Considerations\n\n【16】This pregnant patient has a mild anemia， since the hemoglobin level is less than10.5 g/dL. The red blood cell (RBC) indices give an indication of the etiology. In this case， the MCV is low， microcytic. The most common cause of microcytic anemia is iron deficiency. Typically， with a mild microcytic anemia in the absence of risk factors for thalassemia (such as Southeast Asian ethnicity)， a trial of iron supplementation and recheck of the hemoglobin in 3 weeks would be the next step. This is called a therapeutic trial of iron. If the hemoglobin level improves， the evidence supports iron deficiency. If the hemoglobin level does not improve， iron studies and a hemoglobin electrophoresis would be the next step. In this case， iron studies were performed which were normal/ high normal， thus eliminating iron deficiency as a cause. The hemoglobin electrophoresis studies strongly sug-gest B-thalassemia trait (heterozygous for β-thalassemia) with the elevated A2hemoglobin. If the patient had p-thalassemia homozygous disease， there would have been complications and clinical manifestations since childhood. The patient should now be counseled about her laboratory findings， and referred for genetic counseling， and instructed that her baby has a one in four risk for p-thalassemia disease if the father of the baby also has B-thalassemia trait. Extra iron should not be given， since these patients can be prone to iron overload.\n\n【17】APPROACHTO：\n\n【18】DEFINITIONS\n\n【19】ANEMIA： A hemoglobin level of less than 10.5 g/dL in the pregnant woman.\n\n【20】IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA： A fall in hemoglobin level that is due to insuf-ficient iron to meet the increased iron requirements in pregnancy.\n\n【21】THALASSEMIA： A decreased production of one or more of the peptide chains(most common are the a and B chains) that make up the globin molecule. This process may result in ineffective erythropoiesis， hemolysis， and varying degrees of anemia.\n\n【22】HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA： An abnormally low hemoglobin level due to red blood cell destruction， which may be divided into congenital causes and acquired causes.\n\n【23】GLUCOSE-6-PHOSPHATE DEHYDROGENASE DEFICIENCY： An X-linked condition whereby the red blood cells may have a decreased capacity for anaerobic glucose metabolism. Certain oxidizing agents， such as nitrofurantoin， can lead to hemolysis.\n\n【24】CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【25】Physiology ofPregnancy\n\n【26】Anemia is a common complication in the pregnant woman. It is most often due to iron deficiency， partially because of decreased iron stores prior to pregnancy and increased demands for iron (due to fetus need and expanded maternal blood vol-ume). A hemoglobin level below 10.5 g/ dL is usually considered a sign of anemia in the pregnant woman， with a mild anemia between 8 and 10 g/ dL and severe as less than 7g/dL.\n\n【27】Iron Deficiency\n\n【28】A gravid woman who presents with mild anemia and no risk factors for hemoglo-binopathies (African-American， Southeast Asian， or Mediterranean descent) may be treated with supplemental iron and the hemoglobin level reassessed in 3 to 4weeks. Persistent anemia necessitates an evaluation for iron stores， such as ferritin level (low with iron deficiency) and hemoglobin electrophoresis.\n\n【29】Hemoglobinopathies\n\n【30】The size of the red blood cell may give a clue about the etiology. A microcytic anemia is most commonly due to iron deficiency， although thalassemia may also be causative. Results from a hemoglobin electrophoresis can differentiate between the two， and may also indicate the presence of sickle cell trait or sickle cell anemia. The different types of thalassemias are classified according to the deficient pep-tide chain. In β-thalassemia minor， for example， there is a decreased production of 删除换行1: the B-globin chain. This particular thalassemia during pregnancy is usually safe for both the mother and fetus， and there is no specific therapy given other than pro-phylactic folic acid. Patients may be asymptomatic and go their whole life without being aware that they have -thalassemia minor. Genetic counseling in a patient with a known hemoglobinopathy is important because if the baby inherits a reces-sive trait from both parents， it will typically be born with a more serious or fatal disease (ie， B-thalassemia major). A neonate born with B-thalassemia major may appear healthy at birth， but as the hemoglobin F level falls (and no B-chains are able to replace the diminishing y-chains of the fetal hemoglobin)， the infant may become severely anemic and fail to thrive if not adequately transfused. The life expectancy with transfusions is somewhere in the third decade.\n\n【31】Whereas the thalassemias are quantitative defects in a hemoglobin chain pro-duction， sickle cell disease involves a qualitative defect that results in a sickle-shaped and rigid hemoglobin molecule. Sickle cell anemia is a recessive disorder caused by a point mutation in the p-globin chain in which the amino acid glutamic acid is replaced with valine. This causes improper folding of the hemoglobin molecule， which results in either sickle cell disease (HbSS) or sickle cell trait (HbS)， when only the sickle cell trait is inherited. A patient with sickle cell trait should not be discouraged to get pregnant as far as risk to her is concerned； however， her baby has a 1：4 chance of inheriting sickle cell disease if the father also has the sickle cell trait. Infants born with sickle cell disease typically do not show signs of being affected until about 4 months. Patients with sickle cell disease usually deal with symptoms related to anemia (ie， fatigue and shortness of breath) and pain. In preg-nancy， women with sickle cell disease often have a more intense anemia， more fre-quent bouts of sickle cell crisis (painful vaso-occlusive episodes)， and more frequent infections and pulmonary complications. Careful attention must be taken when a pregnant sickle cell patient presents in crisis because some of the symptoms may mimic other common occurrences during pregnancy (ectopic pregnancy， placental abruption， pyelonephritis， appendicitis， or cholecystitis)， and they may be missed. All causes of fever，pain， and low Hg laboratory value should be considered before attributing it to a pain crisis. Also， these patients have a higher incidence of fetal growth retardation and perinatal mortality； therefore， serial ultrasonography is recommended.\n\n【32】Macrocytic Anemia\n\n【33】Macrocytic anemias may be due to vitamin B， and folate deficiency. Because vita-min B， stores last for many years， megaloblastic anemias in pregnancy are much more likely to be caused by folate deficiency.\n\n【34】Other Conditions\n\n【35】Less commonly， a woman with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) defi-ciency may develop hemolytic anemia triggered by various medications such as sulfonamides， nitrofurantoin， and antimalarial agents. Nitrofurantoin is a com-mon medication utilized for uncomplicated urinary tract infections. Affected women usually have dark-colored urine due to bilirubinuria， jaundice， and fatigue 删除换行1: due to anemia. G6PD deficiency is more commonly seen in the African-American population.\n\n【36】In the pregnant woman with anemia， jaundice， and thrombocytopenia， the examiner must also consider other hemolytic processes，such as HELLP (hemolysis， elevated liver enzymes， low platelets) syndrome， which is a life-threatening condi-tion best treated by delivery. In evaluating anemia， if other hematologic cell lines are also decreased， such as the white blood cell (W BC) count or platelet count， a bone marrow process， such as leukemia or tuberculosis infection of the marrow， should be considered. Bone marrow biopsy may be indicated in these circumstances.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:05:05", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:06:53", "cost": 107.6}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:01", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:06:50", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:05:03"}

At the time ofthe operation， he was noted to have necrosis and perforation of the cecum with fecal peritonitis. On postoperative day 8， the patient remains on the ventilator with PAo，/Fio，=260.Over the past 48 hours， he has developed worsening oliguria with urine output of <300 mL over the past 18 hours. The patient is becoming visibly jaundiced.

The patient is now developing organ dysfunction despite adequate source control. He is showing signs of pulmonary dysfunction with compromised oxygenation (P/F ratio = 260). In addition， he has new-onset compromised renal and hepatic functions as seen by his decreased urine output and visible jaundice. There is no evidence of continued intra-abdominal pathology.\n\n【7】Causes of the patient's current condition： The patient's initial peritonitis and subsequent inflammatory response has resulted in organ dysfunction in multiple systems.\n\n【8】Monitoring and quantifying the organ dysfunction： Continuous monitoring of his organ functions via standard measures (urine output， MAP， oxygen satu-ration， etc) is mandatory， and the level of dysfunction is quantified using the multiple organ dysfunction scale.\n\n【9】Therapeutic strategies and goals for this patient： The therapy for multiple organ dysfunction is mainly supportive， addressing each organ system that is injured. The underlying cause should be treated. Mechanical support may be necessary， such as ventilatory support for pulmonary failure and hemodialysis for renal failure.\n\n【10】ANALYSIS\n\n【11】Objectives\n\n【12】1\\. To learn to identify， quantify， and manage multiple organ dysfunctions associ-ated with critical illnesses.\n\n【13】2\\. To learn the factors that may contribute to the development of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).\n\n【14】3\\. To learn the supportive care for patients with MODS.\n\n【15】Considerations\n\n【16】This patient presented with a single identifiable cause for his illness—appendicitis， cecal perforation with fecal peritonitis. His illness has not resolved with the removal of his diseased colon， irrigation of the peritoneal cavity， and antibiotic administra-tion. Instead， despite appropriate treatment of his peritonitis， his overall status is continuing to deteriorate. His pulmonary function has declined with a P/F ratio that is indicative of acute lung injury. Likewise， he has acute kidney injury demonstrated by his progressive oliguria. His hepatic function has also deteriorated as evidenced by his visible jaundice. These organs become dysfunctional days following the incit-ing event and continue despite the resolution of his initial illness. These are indica-tive of secondary MODS.\n\n【17】APPROACH TO：Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome\n\n【18】DEFINITIONS\n\n【19】MULTIPLE ORGAN DYSFUNCTION SYNDROME： The continued dysfunc-tion of two or more organ systems that occurs as a result of a disruption in homeosta-sis. The organ dysfunction may continue despite the resolution of the initial event. SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE SYNDROME： Occurs when 2 of 删除换行1: the following are present：\n\n【20】1\\. Body temperature <36℃ or >38℃\n\n【21】2\\. Heart rate >90 beats/minute\n\n【22】3\\. Respiratory rate >20 breaths/minute\n\n【23】4\\. White blood cell count <4000 cells/mm’or>12，000 cells/mm’or the presence of >10% immature neutrophils (band forms)\n\n【24】ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY (AKI)： AKI was formerly referred to as acute renal failure (ARF). AKI is defined by a rapid decline in renal function (<48 hours). The decrease in renal function is determined using urine output and/or serum creati-nine levels. An absolute increase in serum creatinine of 20.3 mg/dL or a percentage increase in serum creatinine of ≥50% is indicative of AKI. Also， a reduction in urine output， defined as <0.5 mL/kg/h for more than 6 hours is also AKI.\n\n【25】ACUTE LUNG INJURY/ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME：Hypoxemic respiratory failure， of which the most severe form is acute respiratory dis-tress syndrome (ARDS). Acute lung injury is defined as a P/F ratio of 200 to 300. ARDS is hypoxemic failure with a P/F ratio of <200， bilateral fluffy infiltrates on chest x-ray， and no evidence of congestive heart failure.\n\n【26】P/F RATIO： (PAO，/Fio，) × 100. This is used to identify the degree of pulmonary failure.\n\n【27】CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【28】MODS is a clinical syndrome that has its origins in the ICU. MODS did not exist prior to the ability to keep patients alive who would have otherwise died from their disease processes. Once the ICU care began to evolve and became successful at sustaining patients after life-threatening illnesses， we began to see patients develop remote organ dysfunction despite resolution of their initial insults. Patients who develop MODS have increased length of ICU stays and a 20-fold increase in mortality rate when compared to those patients without MODS.\n\n【29】Pathophysiology\n\n【30】There are multiple factors that may contribute to the development of MODS. Originally， it was thought that MODS only occurred in patients who had severe sepsis. Although sepsis is responsible for almost three-fourths of MODS cases， any 删除换行1: clinical scenario that leads to significant inflammation or host injury responses can cascade into MODS. The beginning of MODS starts with the normal， appropriate physiologic response to a single inciting event， such as pneumonia， pancreatitis， or a gunshot wound to the abdomen. This initial insult activates macrophages， which in turn release pro-inflammatory mediators， as well activate coagulation factors. The pro-inflammatory mediators interact with white blood cells resulting in their recruitment and activation. The inflammatory mediators also cause microvascu lar thromboses， apoptosis derangements， and increased capillary permeability. The procoagulant effects act in conjunction with the previously activated coagulation system， and serves to act as a local protective mechanism against injury. Once the original injury is treated， the inflammatory mediators and coagulation factors return to normal and healing is achieved.\n\n【31】However， occasionally， despite the resolution of the inciting event， the normal physiologic response acts as a positive feedback loop， leading to overamplification of the immune response. The activation of the white blood cells can also release pro-inflammatory mediators that activate more monocytes/macrophages， which in turn releases additional pro-inflammatory mediators. This continued inflammation and coagulation cause cellular damage， which in turn activates more inflammatory mediators. More cellular damage occurs with subsequent organ failure. Once this initial organ system fails， inflammatory mediators continue to be released， acting on other organ systems， until there is multiorgan dysfunction.\n\n【32】Once patients have been treated for their original injury and continue to have clinical deterioration， MODS should be considered as the diagnosis. Although the pulmonary system is often noted to be the first organ system to fail， there is no stan-dard progression of organ failure. The degree of organ dysfunction is often graded by the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome score 删除25：<u></u>. There is no single therapy for MODS and the treatment is largely supportive. The goal of therapy is to decrease the continued cellular injury in each organ so that the positive feedback loop can be interrupted with an aim toward return of normal homeostasis.\n\n【33】The best treatment of MODS is to identify the patients at greatest risk for MODS and begin preemptive therapy to limit its progression. This is best accomplished by optimizing cardiac and pulmonary performance early in the disease process，\n\n| Table 33-1 · MULTIPLE ORGAN DYSFUNCTION SCORE (MODS)  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| SCORE  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Organ System  | 0  |  | 2  | 3  | 4  |\n| Respiratory (P/F)  | \\>300  | 226-300  | 151-225  | 76-150  | <75  |\n| Renal (serum Cr) (umol/L)  | <100  | 101-200  | 201-350  | 351-500  | \\>500  |\n| Hepatic (serum bilirubin)(u.mol/L)  | <20  | 21-60  | 61-120  | 121-240  | \\>240  |\n| Cardiovascular (PAR)  | <10  | 10.1-15  | 15.1-20  | \\>20.1-30  | \\>30  |\n| Hematologic (plateletcount)  | \\>120  | 81-120  | 51-80  | 21-50  | <20  |\n| Neurologic (GCS)  | 15  | 13-14  | 10-12  | 7-9  | <6  |\n\n| Table 33-2·AVERAGE ICU STAY (DAYS)  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| MOD Score (Points)  | ICU Mortality  | Hospital Mortality  | ICU Stay (days)  |\n| 0  | 0%  | 0%  | 2  |\n| T-4  | 1%-2%  | 7%  | 3  |\n| 5-8  | 3%-5%  | 16%  | 6  |\n| 9-12  | 25%  | 50%  | 10  |\n| 13-16  | 50%  | 70%  | 17  |\n| 17-20  | 75%  | 82%  | 21  |\n| 21-24  | 100%  | 100%  |   |\n\n【36】Data from： Marshall JC， Cook DJ， Christou NV， et al Multiple organ dysfunction score： a reli-able descriptor of a complex clinical outcome.

Increased vigilance should also be used to monitor and detect new organ failure during treatment. Mortality in the ICU is related to the number of organs and the severity of organ injury. Prognosis depends on the MOD score .\n\n【39】The pulmonary system is frequently the earliest organ system to fail. Patients who develop MODS are often already intubated and are unable to be weaned off the ventilator despite treatment of their original illness. Acute lung injury (ALI) is an umbrella term for hypoxemic respiratory failure. The most severe form of ALI is ARDS. In acute lung injury， there is a failure of normal gas exchange. The inflam-mation affects oxygen uptake more than carbon dioxide elimination. This occurs early because of atelectasis and intravascular thrombosis. As the inflammatory pro-cess progresses， there is an increase in capillary permeability， leading to increase in alveolar fluid that increases the distance for oxygen diffusion to occur.\n\n【40】Identification of a P/F ratio of <300 indicates that the patient has acute lung in-jury. A P/F ratio of <200 is a risk factor for having ARDS. The definition of ARDS is having a P/F ratio <200 with bilateral fluffy infiltrates without evidence of con-gestive heart failure. Once acute lung injury or ARDS is diagnosed， lung-protective ventilation should be initiated. The goal for treatment of these patients is to con-tinue to provide adequate oxygenation without further damage to the alveoli. This is best accomplished with low tidal volumes， increased positive end expiratory pressure(PEEP)， and limiting peak plateau pressures. This lung-protective ventilation strat-egy decreases the incidence of volutrauma and barotrauma， and also decreases the levels of inflammatory mediators.\n\n【41】The biggest risk factor for developing MODS is circulatory failure within the first 24 hours of admission. This is why early management of resuscitation is extremely important in critically ill patients. The cause of circulatory failure during MODS is multifactorial. During the initial phase of inflammation， TNF and reac-tive oxygen species inhibit cardiac contractility. Additionally， the early cytokines 删除换行1: released result in increased vascular permeability and vasodilation. This combina-tion results in loss of effective preload， contractility， and afterload. The treatment for circulatory failure is fluid resuscitation. However， this treatment may contribute to the worsening of the system， as the fluids administered may not stay intravascular because of the increased vascular permeability. This contributes to the increase in organ failure and the cycle continues. The use of pressors is advocated only once it is determined that the intravascular volume has been repleted. Likewise， the blood and blood products can be used to increase intravascular volume， but are associated with complications. The injudicious use of vasopressors and blood transfusions is known to increase morbidity and mortality. The use of ScVO， (central venous oxy-gen saturation obtained via central venous catheter)， lactate， and base excess can help guide the initial resuscitation. The ScVO，reflects the upper body/head extrac-tion of oxygen and is usually higher than the mixed venous O， in situations of shock.\n\n【42】Acute kidney injury (AKI)， formerly referred to as acute renal failure (ARF) is a decline in renal function as determined by either a rise in serum creatinine levels or a decrease in urine output. Serum creatinine levels that increase by 0.3 mg/dL or by50% from baseline is AKI. Urine output that is ≤0.5 mL/kg/h for more than 6 hours is also AKI. In MODS， the causes of AKI are both intrinsic and pre-renal. Early in the course of MODS， hypotension can lead to early AKI， while examples of late causes are nephrotoxic drugs and contrast-induced nephropathy. Hypoxemia can lead to cellular destruction and altered renal function. Renal replacement therapy(dialysis) may be necessary to support a patient with MODS and AKI.\n\n【43】Patients with MODS can develop hepatic dysfunction as identified by cholesta-sis and jaundice. Bilirubin levels are used to determine the severity of dysfunction on the MODS-scoring system. The elevation of bilirubin is most likely a result of leakage of bile from hepatic canaliculi that have been damaged by cytotoxins and inflammatory mediators. The elevation of acute-phase reactants， such as C-reactive protein and a， antitrypsin， is common during the inflammatory stages of MODS. The hepatic dysfunction identified in MODS is usually not life threatening. There is no specific supportive therapy aimed directly at the liver， so continued support of the other systems is all that is necessary.\n删除16：<u>CLINICAL CASE CORRELATION\n删除25：<u>See also Case 1 (Early Awareness of Critical Illness)， Case 3 (Scoring Systems and Patient Prognosis)， Case 22 (Acute Liver Failure)， and Case 23 (Acute Kidney Injury).</u>\n</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【37】", "content": "【0】Case 33\n\n【1】A 63-year-old man underwent a surgical appendectomy and colostomy formation for a ruptured appendicitis with abscess and devitalized cecum. At the time ofthe operation， he was noted to have necrosis and perforation of the cecum with fecal peritonitis. On postoperative day 8， the patient remains on the ventilator with PAo，/Fio，=260.Over the past 48 hours， he has developed worsening oliguria with urine output of <300 mL over the past 18 hours. The patient is becoming visibly jaundiced.

The patient is now developing organ dysfunction despite adequate source control. He is showing signs of pulmonary dysfunction with compromised oxygenation (P/F ratio = 260). In addition， he has new-onset compromised renal and hepatic functions as seen by his decreased urine output and visible jaundice. There is no evidence of continued intra-abdominal pathology.\n\n【7】Causes of the patient's current condition： The patient's initial peritonitis and subsequent inflammatory response has resulted in organ dysfunction in multiple systems.\n\n【8】Monitoring and quantifying the organ dysfunction： Continuous monitoring of his organ functions via standard measures (urine output， MAP， oxygen satu-ration， etc) is mandatory， and the level of dysfunction is quantified using the multiple organ dysfunction scale.\n\n【9】Therapeutic strategies and goals for this patient： The therapy for multiple organ dysfunction is mainly supportive， addressing each organ system that is injured.

His illness has not resolved with the removal of his diseased colon， irrigation of the peritoneal cavity， and antibiotic administra-tion. Instead， despite appropriate treatment of his peritonitis， his overall status is continuing to deteriorate. His pulmonary function has declined with a P/F ratio that is indicative of acute lung injury. Likewise， he has acute kidney injury demonstrated by his progressive oliguria. His hepatic function has also deteriorated as evidenced by his visible jaundice.

AKI is defined by a rapid decline in renal function (<48 hours). The decrease in renal function is determined using urine output and/or serum creati-nine levels. An absolute increase in serum creatinine of 20.3 mg/dL or a percentage increase in serum creatinine of ≥50% is indicative of AKI. Also， a reduction in urine output， defined as <0.5 mL/kg/h for more than 6 hours is also AKI.\n\n【25】ACUTE LUNG INJURY/ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME：Hypoxemic respiratory failure， of which the most severe form is acute respiratory dis-tress syndrome (ARDS). Acute lung injury is defined as a P/F ratio of 200 to 300. ARDS is hypoxemic failure with a P/F ratio of <200， bilateral fluffy infiltrates on chest x-ray， and no evidence of congestive heart failure.\n\n【26】P/F RATIO： (PAO，/Fio，) × 100. This is used to identify the degree of pulmonary failure.\n\n【27】CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【28】MODS is a clinical syndrome that has its origins in the ICU. MODS did not exist prior to the ability to keep patients alive who would have otherwise died from their disease processes. Once the ICU care began to evolve and became successful at sustaining patients after life-threatening illnesses， we began to see patients develop remote organ dysfunction despite resolution of their initial insults. Patients who develop MODS have increased length of ICU stays and a 20-fold increase in mortality rate when compared to those patients without MODS.\n\n【29】Pathophysiology\n\n【30】There are multiple factors that may contribute to the development of MODS. Originally， it was thought that MODS only occurred in patients who had severe sepsis.

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is characterized by acute episodes of hemolytic anemia following administration of certain medications, infection, or ingestion of fava beans. G6PD is the first and rate-limiting enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway, which produces two reducing equivalents that keep glutathione in its reduced state. Reduced glutathione is necessary to detoxify peroxides and free radicals that can accumulate within RBCs and cause damage to various cellular structures. Heinz bodies are small round inclusions seen within RBCs that comprise hemoglobin and other protein precipitates. G6PD deficiency is most common in people who are black, people of Mediterranean descent, and people from tropical Africa and Asia.  \n\n【8】Answer A is incorrect. Alkaptonuria is a rare genetic disorder in which patients present with urine that darkens on exposure to air. These patients cannot breakdown the amino acid tyrosine, which results in the accumulation of a by-product called homogentisic acid. Homogentisic acid builds up in the skin and connective tissues and is excreted in the urine, causing the dark color. Patients typically have a good prognosis, although many suffer from arthritis as well as heart disease and kidney/prostate stones.  \n\n【9】Answer B is incorrect. Cystinuria is caused by a defect in an amino acid transporter in the renal tubules. This is an inherited defect that affects the absorption of four amino acids: cystine, ornithine, lysine, and arginine. Cystine kidney stones can form as a result of excess cystine in the urine. This disorder is not associated with the jaundice or hematologic abnormalities seen in this patient.  \n\n【10】Answer D is incorrect. Hereditary fructose intolerance is an autosomal-recessive inherited disease due to a deficiency of aldolase B, which causes an accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate. The decrease in available phosphate leads to inhibition of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. Patients present with jaundice, cirrhosis, hypoglycemia, and scleral icterus. Hepatosplenomegaly is often seen on physical examination. It is usually diagnosed in early childhood, when children are weaned from formula to regular table food.  \n\n【11】Answer E is incorrect. Hereditary spherocyto-sis is caused by a variety of molecular defects in genes that code for spectrin, ankyrin, protein 4.1, and other RBC membrane proteins. The structural defect makes the RBCs more fragile and they take on a spherical shape, hence the name “spherocytes.” Spherocytes are recognized as abnormal and destroyed in the spleen, resulting in severe anemia and splenomegaly. Splenectomy curbs the anemia; however, the RBCs will continue to be spherical in shape.  \n\n【12】Answer F is incorrect. Lactase deficiency can be due to either an inherited intolerance or an age-dependent acquired intolerance of the sugar lactose. Acquired lactase deficiency (decreased expression with increased age) is more common in Africans and Asians.

Although she normally has a healthy appetite, over the past three days she has had little interest in eating. Furthermore, her belly has become rigid and diffusely tender. X-ray of the abdomen reveals dilated loops of small intestines. Which of the following predisposes this patient to this condition?\n\n【1】> (A) Celiac sprue\n\n【2】> (B) Chronic Helicobacter pylori infection\n\n【3】> (C) History of abdominal surgery\n\n【4】> (D) Smoking\n\n【5】> (E) Ulcerative colitis\n\n【6】 Answer: The correct answer is C . This patient has a small bowel obstruction. Dilated loops of small intestines on x-ray of the abdomen and a clinical history of anorexia, vomiting, and abdominal pain are usually sufficient to make the diagnosis. In the United States, the leading cause of small bowel obstructions is adhesion formation, which obstructs the lumen of the small bowel. These adhesions are formed during the healing process secondary to abdominal surgery. Other conditions that predispose patients to small bowel obstructions are hernias and intraluminal cancers of the small intestine.  \n\n【7】Answer A is incorrect . Celiac sprue can present with GI upset, diarrhea, and flatulence, but does not have a correlation with small bowel obstruction. Dermatitis herpetiformis is a dermatologic manifestation of gluten insensitivity that presents with erythematous, grouped, pruritic papules.  \n\n【8】Answer B is incorrect . Infection with Helicobacter pylori is limited to gastric and duodenal mucosa and is not known to cause strictures or adhesions. Therefore even chronic infections have no potential to cause small bowel obstructions. Long-standing H pylori infection can cause MALT lymphoma and peptic ulcers.  \n\n【9】Answer D is incorrect . Although smoking has multiple detrimental effects on health, it has no correlation to the progression of small bowel obstructions.  \n\n【10】Answer E is incorrect . Ulcerative colitis does not predispose patients to small bowel obstruction because this inflammatory disease process is limited to mucosa and submucosa. Crohn disease, on the other hand, can lead to small bowel obstruction, as it can cause transmural inflammatory and bowel strictures.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:09:22", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:09:27", "cost": 5.478}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:01", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:09:26", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:09:21"}

The patient’s CD4+ count is 22/mm <sup class=\"calibre40\">3 </sup> . MRI shows several hyperintensities on T2-weighted images that do not enhance with contrast and are not surrounded by edema. A lumbar puncture shows a normal opening pressure, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows a mildly elevated protein level and the presence of myelin basic protein, with a mild mononuclear pleocytosis. Which of the following entities is most likely responsible for this patient’s clinical picture?\n\n【1】> (A) Cortical tuberculoma\n\n【2】> (B) Cytomegalovirus encephalitis\n\n【3】> (C) JC virus\n\n【4】> (D) Primary central nervous system lymphoma\n\n【5】> (E) Toxoplasmosis\n\n【6】 Answer: The correct answer is C. The clinical picture and imaging are consistent with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) secondary to reactivation of latent JC virus infection, which can occur with CD4+ counts <50/mm <sup class=\"calibre40\">3 </sup> . It typically presents with rapidly progressive focal neurologic deficits without signs of increased intracranial pressure. Ataxia, aphasia, and cranial nerve deficits also may occur. Lumbar puncture is nondiagnostic and frequently demonstrates mild elevations in protein and WBCs. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis can reveal the presence of myelin basic protein, which is due to demyelination caused by the JC virus. PML typically presents as multiple nonenhancing T2-hyperintense lesions. When it is suspected, stereotactic biopsy is required for definitive diagnosis, but a positive CSF polymerase chain reaction for JC virus is diagnostic in the appropriate clinical setting. Histology of the lesions shows nuclear inclusions in oligodendrocytes. Although there is no definitive treatment, clearance of JC virus DNA can be observed with response to highly active antiretroviral therapy.  \n\n【7】Answer A is incorrect. Uncommon in the developed world, but presenting with increased risk in homeless and HIV patients, cortical tuberculomas are caseating foci within the cortical parenchyma occurring from previous hematogenous mycoplasma bacillemia. The clinical presentation may be similar to that of the current patient; however, presentation would include enhancing nodular lesions on imaging and elevated protein and low glucose on CSF examination.  \n\n【8】Answer B is incorrect. CMV encephalitis can mimic the appearance of PML, but would be associated with enhancing periventricular white matter lesions in cortical and subependymal regions. CMV encephalitis also is associated typically with more systemic signs and symptoms. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of CSF would be positive for CMV, and histo-logic exam shows giant cells with eosinophilic inclusions in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus.  \n\n【9】Answer D is incorrect. Central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma typically affects those with CD4+ cell counts <50/mm <sup class=\"calibre40\">3 </sup> . MRI will demonstrate one or more enhancing lesions (50% are multiple and 50% are single) that typically are surrounded by edema, and can produce a mass effect. CNS lymphoma can present with polymerase chain reaction findings positive for Epstein-Barr virus on CSF.  \n\n【10】Answer E is incorrect. Space-occupying lesions due to toxoplasmosis infection represent the most common cause of cerebral mass lesions in HIV-infected patients, and typically present with multiple enhancing lesions on MRI. The lesions typically are located at the corticomedullary junction, and are surrounded by edema that frequently produces a mass effect and distinguishes its appearance from PML.

It is most commonly observed in children, between two and five years of age. The disease is highly contagious and primarily caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes . Impetigo is distinguished as either non-bullous (70% of all cases) and bullous (30% of cases) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Nonbullous impetigo is characterized by honey-colored crusts on erythematous background localized most commonly on the face and extremities. Mild regional lymphadenopathy commonly occurs, but systemic symptoms are rarely observed. Mucous membranes are not affected. Bullous impetigo is characterized by the presence of small vesicles, which becomes flaccid bullae. They contain a clear or yellow fluid which eventually progresses to become purulent or dark. Once the bullae rupture, an erythematous base with a rim of scale is observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 – 3 \\]</u>. Bullous impetigo tends to be less contagious. Lesions besides the face and extremities, are localized on the armpits, trunk, and perianal region 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Buccal mucous membranes may be also affected. Regional lymphadenopathy is rarely presented. Systemic symptoms, such as fever, are more common compared to nonbullous impetigo 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Complications of impetigo are rare. Glomerulonephritis occurs in 5% of patients with impetigo 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The diagnosis of impetigo is usually based on the clinical picture. A bacterial culture from the lesion may be necessary if the lesion is resistant to treatment, but it is not required prior to initial therapy. In case of widespread impetigo, an increased white blood cell count with neutrophilia and an elevated C-reactive protein may be observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Impetigo is most commonly treated with topical antibiotics such as mupirocin, retapamulin, and fusidic acid 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Systemic antibiotics should be recommended for all cases of bullous impetigo and cases of non-bullous impetigo with more than three lesions, scalp or deep tissue involvement, systemic signs of infection, lymphadenopathy or lesions in the oral cavity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Beta-lactamase-resistant antibiotics such as cephalosporins, amoxicillin-clavulanate, dicloxacillin are recommended 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【34】Differential diagnoses for the presented case included kerion , pemphigus vulgaris and seborrheic dermatitis .\n\n【35】Kerion is a form of inflammatory tinea capitis mainly observed in the prepubertal population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. It presents as a painful, crusty carbuncle-like boggy plaque with subsequent scarring. It usually occurs as a solitary lesion, most commonly on the occipital area 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. On trichoscopy, hair shaft abnormalities are presented.\n\n【36】Pemphigus vulgaris is a form of an autoimmune bullous disease affecting the skin and mucous membranes. Women between 50 and 60 years of age are most commonly affected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Skin involvement is characterized by flaccid blisters and erosions localized mainly on the flexural areas, face, scalp, and extremities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【37】Seborrheic dermatitis is an inflammatory skin disorder characterized by the presence of erythematous plaques with greasy, yellowish scales. Mild itch is usually presented. No hair loss is observed. The scalp (mainly the vertex and parietal areas) is most commonly affected. However, the disease can be also observed on the face, chest, back, axilla and groin areas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【38】Based on the clinical features the patient was diagnosed with impetigo . He was treated with intravenous and then oral amoxicillin with clavulonic acid for 14 days. Additionally, topical antiseptics were used. Complete resolution of skin lesion was observed.\n\n【39】Key Points\n\n【40】   Impetigo is an acute, bacterial skin infection which may affect the scalp area.\n\n【41】   The disease presents as honey-colored crusts (nonbullous impetigo) or small vesicles, which becomes flaccid bullae (bullous impetigo).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:17:35", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:17:45", "cost": 9.541}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:01", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:17:43", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:17:33"}

The fainting episodes were preceded by  删除换行1: palpitation and associated with blurring of vision. The patient was a known case of  删除换行1: coronary heart disease and she had sustained an anterior wall myocardial infarction  删除换行1: ten months back. At that time, she did not receive thrombolytic therapy because of  删除换行1: late presentation to the hospital and she had also declined coronary angiography. \n\n【4】The patient also felt breathless on exertion and her echocardiogram showed a  删除换行1: large anterior wall motion abnormality with an ejection fraction of 30+5%. About  删除换行1: a month back, she underwent 24-hour Holter monitoring which showed multifocal  删除换行1: ventricular premature beats, with short runs of ventricular tachycardia.

An initial  删除换行1: loading dose of 1200 mg per day of amiodarone, was tapered to a maintenance dose  删除换行1: of 400 mg daily after one week. \n\n【5】On examination, the patient was apprehensive and tachypneic. The pulse was  删除换行1: fast and low in volume with a few “missed beats”. The heart rate was 104 beats/min. \n\n【6】with a BP of 110/66 mm Hg. The cardiac apical impulse was diffuse and displaced  删除换行1: towards the axilla. The S1 删除换行1:  and S2 删除换行1:  were normal with an S3 删除换行1:  gallop sound in diastole. No  删除换行1: murmur or friction rub was audible. There were bilateral basilar rales over the lung  删除换行1: fields. An ECG was obtained . \n\n【7】删除3：<u>Figure 38.1: ECG showing broad T waves with prolonged Q-T interval</u>\n\n【8】ECG INTERPRETATION \n\n【9】The ECG showed normal regular sinus rhythm. The P waves were normal in  删除换行1: morphology and large Q waves were seen in the anterior precordial leads. The 176 Section 12 Electrocardiac Syndromes\n\n【10】The upper limit of normal Q-T interval depends upon several variables,  删除换行1: including the age, gender and the autonomic tone. It tends to be shorter in young  删除换行1: individuals (0.44 sec) and longer in the elderly (0.45 sec). It is slightly shorter in  删除换行1: males than in females, the upper limit being 0.43 sec in men. The Q-T interval  删除换行1: shortens at fast heart rates and lengthens at slow heart rates. Since the Q-T interval  删除换行1: varies with tachycardia and bradycardia, the measured Q-T interval needs to be  删除换行1: corrected for heart rate. \n\n【11】The corrected Q-T interval is known as the Q-Tc interval. For heart rate  删除换行1: correction, the Bazett’s formula is generally used, where Q-Tc interval is equal to  删除换行1: the measured Q-T interval divided by the square-root of the R-R interval. When  删除换行1: the heart rate is 60 beats/min. and the R-R interval is 1 sec (25 x 0.04sec), the Q-Tc  删除换行1: interval and the Q-T interval are the same. As a general rule, a Q-T interval that  删除换行1: exceeds half of the R-R interval, is taken as a prolonged Q-T interval. \n\n【12】CLINICAL DISCUSSION \n\n【13】There are several causes of Q-T interval prolongation. These have been enlisted  删除换行1: in Table 38.1. Congenital long Q-T syndromes may present dramatically  删除换行1: with syncope. Indeed, congenital long Q-T syndromes are characterized by  删除换行1: prolongation of the Q-T interval, syncope, ‘seizures’ and sudden death due to  删除换行1: ventricular arrhythmias (Torsade de pointes), in apparently healthy children  删除换行1: and young adults.

The fainting episodes were preceded by  删除换行1: palpitation and associated with blurring of vision. The patient was a known case of  删除换行1: coronary heart disease and she had sustained an anterior wall myocardial infarction  删除换行1: ten months back. At that time, she did not receive thrombolytic therapy because of  删除换行1: late presentation to the hospital and she had also declined coronary angiography. \n\n【4】The patient also felt breathless on exertion and her echocardiogram showed a  删除换行1: large anterior wall motion abnormality with an ejection fraction of 30+5%. About  删除换行1: a month back, she underwent 24-hour Holter monitoring which showed multifocal  删除换行1: ventricular premature beats, with short runs of ventricular tachycardia. Therefore,  删除换行1: she was prescribed amiodarone, in addition to her usual medication which included  删除换行1: ramipril, frusemide, aspirin, atorvastatin and isosorbide mononitrate. An initial  删除换行1: loading dose of 1200 mg per day of amiodarone, was tapered to a maintenance dose  删除换行1: of 400 mg daily after one week. \n\n【5】On examination, the patient was apprehensive and tachypneic. The pulse was  删除换行1: fast and low in volume with a few “missed beats”. The heart rate was 104 beats/min. \n\n【6】with a BP of 110/66 mm Hg. The cardiac apical impulse was diffuse and displaced  删除换行1: towards the axilla. The S1 删除换行1:  and S2 删除换行1:  were normal with an S3 删除换行1:  gallop sound in diastole.

An ECG was obtained . \n\n【7】删除3：<u>Figure 38.1: ECG showing broad T waves with prolonged Q-T interval</u>\n\n【8】ECG INTERPRETATION \n\n【9】The ECG showed normal regular sinus rhythm. The P waves were normal in  删除换行1: morphology and large Q waves were seen in the anterior precordial leads. The 176 Section 12 Electrocardiac Syndromes\n\n【10】The upper limit of normal Q-T interval depends upon several variables,  删除换行1: including the age, gender and the autonomic tone. It tends to be shorter in young  删除换行1: individuals (0.44 sec) and longer in the elderly (0.45 sec). It is slightly shorter in  删除换行1: males than in females, the upper limit being 0.43 sec in men. The Q-T interval  删除换行1: shortens at fast heart rates and lengthens at slow heart rates. Since the Q-T interval  删除换行1: varies with tachycardia and bradycardia, the measured Q-T interval needs to be  删除换行1: corrected for heart rate. \n\n【11】The corrected Q-T interval is known as the Q-Tc interval. For heart rate  删除换行1: correction, the Bazett’s formula is generally used, where Q-Tc interval is equal to  删除换行1: the measured Q-T interval divided by the square-root of the R-R interval. When  删除换行1: the heart rate is 60 beats/min. and the R-R interval is 1 sec (25 x 0.04sec), the Q-Tc  删除换行1: interval and the Q-T interval are the same. As a general rule, a Q-T interval that  删除换行1: exceeds half of the R-R interval, is taken as a prolonged Q-T interval. \n\n【12】CLINICAL DISCUSSION \n\n【13】There are several causes of Q-T interval prolongation. These have been enlisted  删除换行1: in Table 38.1. Congenital long Q-T syndromes may present dramatically  删除换行1: with syncope. Indeed, congenital long Q-T syndromes are characterized by  删除换行1: prolongation of the Q-T interval, syncope, ‘seizures’ and sudden death due to  删除换行1: ventricular arrhythmias (Torsade de pointes), in apparently healthy children  删除换行1: and young adults.

Antiarrhythmic drugs such  删除换行1: as quinidine, procainamide and amiodarone can prolong the Q-T interval. They  删除换行1: also cause widening of the QRS complex which, if it exceeds 25% of baseline, is  删除换行1: an indication for withdrawing the culprit drug.

A plateau in the hCG level may indicate incomplete abortion or ectopic pregnancy.

In the ED， her blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg and heart rate is80 beats per minute. Her uterus is firm and the cervix is closed. The hCG level is 2000 mIU/mL.

Repeat hCG level in 48 hours\n\n【24】26.1 C. In general， any woman in the childbearing age group with abdominal pain or abnormal vaginal bleeding should have a pregnancy test. If pregnant， then ectopic pregnancy should be ruled out.\n\n【25】26.2 A. A large number of women who undergo methotrexate treatment of ectopic pregnancy will have some abdominal discomfort. As long as there are no signs of rupture such as hypotension， severe pain， or free fluid on ultrasound， expect-ant management may be practiced.\n\n【26】26.3 A. In vitro fertilization with embryo transfer produces a rate of coexisting intrauterine pregnancy and ectopic pregnancy of up to 3% (markedly higher than the spontaneous rate of 1：10，000). Thus， a woman who has undergone in vitro fertilization who presents with abdominal fluid and hypotension must be suspected as having an ectopic pregnancy， even when an intrauterine preg-nancy has been visualized on sonography.\n\n【27】26.4 B. The presence of uterine cramping， vaginal bleeding， passage of tissue， and an open cervical os in a pregnant woman is consistent with an incomplete abortion. Uterine curettage would be the therapy.\n\n【28】26.5 D. This patient likely has a completed abortion with the resolution of symp-toms following passage of tissue and now with a small uterus and closed cervi-cal os. Nevertheless， there is still a possibility of ectopic pregnancy and perhaps the“tissue”passed was only blood clot. The tissue should be sent for pathologic analysis. Also， a repeat hCG level should be performed to ensure that all tissue has passed. The hCG level should fall by about 50% in 48 hours if all tissue has passed. A plateau in the hCG level may indicate incomplete abortion or ectopic pregnancy. Dilation and curettage would generally be performed， and if chorionic villi found the diagnosis is miscarriage； absence of chorionic villi establishes the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy which may be treated by surgery or methotrexate.\n\n【29】CLINICALPEARLS\n\n【30】In any woman of childbearing age， consider pregnancy. If the pregnancy test is positive， consider an ectopic pregnancy.\n\n【31】Consider pregnancy even when a woman has had a tubal ligation or is using contraception.\n\n【32】When the serum quantitative hCG level is above 1500 to 2000 mlU/mL and transvaginal ultrasound does not reveal an intrauterine pregnancy the risk of ectopic pregnancy is high.\n\n【33】SSurgery， not methotrexate， is the best treatment for the patient who is hemodynamically unstable or with significant abdominal pain.\n\n【34】Laparoscopy remains the gold standard for ectopic pregnancy.", "index": 2377, "show": true, "start": 2377, "end": 2378, "province": ["语法规范性", "错别字"], "isEdit": false, "comment": "【22】( 为错别字  无法选中"}], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:33:43", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:34:29", "cost": 46}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:01", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:34:27", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:33:41"}

The first priority for the physician is to assess whether the patient is more ill than the complaint would indicate： stridorous breathing， air hunger， toxic appearance， or drooling with inability to swallow would indicate impending disaster. The ABCs (airway， breathing， circulation) must always be addressed first. This patient does not have those types of“alarms.\" Thus a more relaxed elicitation of his history can take place， and examination of the head， neck， and throat can be performed. In instances suggestive of epiglottitis such as stridor， drooling， and toxic appearance， examination of the throat (especially with a tongue blade) may cause upper airway obstruction in children， leading to respiratory failure. During the examination， the clinician should be alert for complications of upper airway infec-tion； however， this patient presents with a simple pharyngitis.\n\n【21】Overall the most common etiology of pharyngitis is viral organisms. This teen-ager has several features that make group A streptococcus more likely： age less than15 years， fever， absence of cough， and the presence of tonsillar exudate. Of note， 删除换行1: the patient does not have “tender anterior cervical adenopathy.\" The diagnosis of group A streptococcal pharyngitis can be made clinically or with the aid of rapid antigen testing.Rapid streptococcal antigen testing can give a fairly accurate result immediately and treatment or nontreatment with penicillin can be based on this result. If the rapid streptococcal antigen test is positive， antibiotic therapy should be given； if the rapid test is negative， throat culture should be performed and antibiot-ics should be withheld. The gold standard for diagnosis is bacterial culture， and if positive， the patient should be notified and given penicillin therapy.\n\n【22】APPROACH TO：\n\n【23】The differential diagnosis of pharyngitis is broad and includes viral etiologies(rhinovirus， coronavirus， adenovirus， herpes simplex virus \\[HSV\\]， influenza， para-influenza， Epstein-Barr virus EBV\\]， and CMV \\[cytomegalovirus\\] \\[causing infectious mononucleosis\\]， coxsackievirus \\[causing herpanginal， and the human immunodefi-ciency virus \\[HIV\\])， bacterial causes (GABS， group C streptococci， Arcanobacterium haemolyticum， meningococcal， gonococcal， diphteritic， chlamydial， Legionella， and Mycoplasma species)， specific anatomically related conditions caused by bacterial organisms (peritonsillar abscess， epiglottitis， retropharyngeal abscess， Vincent angina， and Ludwig angina)， candidal pharyngitis， aphthous stomatitis， thyroiditis， and bul-lous erythema multiforme. Viruses are the most common cause of pharyngitis.\n\n【24】Group A streptococcus causes pharyngitis in 5% to 10% of adults and 15% to 30% of children who seek medical care with the complaint of sore throat. It is often clinically indistinguishable from other etiologies， yet it is the major treatable cause of pharyngitis. Primary HIV infection may also cause acute pharyngitis， and its recognition can be beneficial because early antiretroviral therapy can be started. Infectious mononucleosis is also important to exclude because of the risk of splenomegaly and splenic rupture. Other bacterial etiologies may also be treated with antibiotics. Studies suggest that certain symptoms and historical features are suggestive of streptococcal pharyngitis and may help guide the provider in generating a reasonable pretest probability of GABS. The Centor criteria， modified by age risk， is helpful in assessing for GABS .\n\n【25】Of note， recent epidemiologic data suggest Fusobacterium necrophorum causes pharyngitis at a rate similar to GABS in young adults and if not treated is implicated in causing Lemierre syndrome， a life-threatening suppurative complication.\n\n【26】Throat cultures remain the gold standard for the diagnosis of GABS pharyngitis， but they have several limitations in use for daily practice. False-negative throat cultures may occur in patients with few organisms in their pharynx or as a result of inadequate sampling (improper swabbing method， errors in incubation or reading of plates). False-positive throat cultures may occur in individuals who are asymptom-atic carriers of GABS. Throat cultures are costly and， perhaps more importantly， require 24 to 48 hours for results.

Nevertheless， a negative throat culture may prompt discontinuation of antibiotics.\n\n【31】The rapid-antigen test (RAT) for GABS， despite having some limitations， has been embraced by many experts and incorporated into diagnostic algorithms. The RAT is 80% to 90% sensitive and exceedingly specific when compared to throat cultures. Results are point-of-care and available in minutes. Many experts recom-mend confirmation of negative RAT with throat culture. Individuals with positive RAT results should be treated. Newer technologies， such as the optical immunoas-say， may prove to be as sensitive as throat cultures while providing results within minutes； its cost-effectiveness has not been established.\n\n【32】If RAT is available， then one accepted algorithm is given in Figure 1-1.\n\n【33】删除3：<u>Figure 1-1.

The possible exceptions to this 2-point rule are in the setting of a GABS outbreak， patient contact with many children， an immunocompromised patient， or a patient with recent expo-sure to someone with confirmed GABS.\n\n【41】Of note， antibiotic therapy in GABS pharyngitis has been de-emphasized because complications have become increasingly rare and the data to support the efficacy of antibiotic therapy in prevention of these complications is sparse and many decades old.\n\n【42】The complications of GABS can be classified into nonsuppurative and suppura-tive processes. The nonsuppurative complications of GABS pharyngitis include 删除换行1: aConsider antibiotics if in setting of GABS outbreak， patient had contact with many children， is immunocompromised， or recent exposure to a patient with documented GABS.\n\n【43】删除3：<u>Figure 1-2. Algorithm when RAT unavailable.</u>\n\n【44】rheumatic fever， streptococcal toxic shock syndrome， poststreptococcal glomeru-lonephritis， and PANDAS (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder asso-ciated with group A streptococci). Rheumatic fever is now rare in the United States(an incidence of <1 case per 100，000)， and is thought to be caused by only a handful of strains of GABS. Despite its rarity， rheumatic fever can result in highly morbid cardiac and neurological sequela； it also remains the most common cause of acquired heart disease in children and adolescents in some developing countries. Published literature suggests the GABS number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one case of rheumatic fever is between 53 and thousands depending on the endemic incidence of rheumatic fever. Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome is a very rare complication of pharyngitis. Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis， another feared complication of GABS pharyngitis， is also very rare， and it occurs with equal frequency in both anti-biotic-treated and nonantibiotic-treated groups. It is unclear if antibiotic therapy reduces the incidence of PANDAS， which is a clinical entity in development and presents with episodes of obsessive-compulsive behavior.\n\n【45】Prevention of the suppurative complications of GABS pharyngitis remains per-haps the most compelling reason for antibiotic therapy. These processes include Se tonsillopharyngeal cellulitis， peritonsillar and retropharyngeal abscesses， sinusitis， meningitis， brain abscess， and streptococcal bacteremia. The precise incidence of these complications is unclear， but what remains clear is that these are often prevent-able sequela that can have devastating consequences. Ultimately， the current prac-tice is to treat suspected GABS pharyngitis with an appropriate antibiotic.\n\n【46】Treatment ofGABS\n\n【47】Penicillin is the antibiotic of choice for GABS pharyngitis. A Cochrane review of the literature concluded that penicillin is the first choice antibiotic in patients with acute throat infections. The antibiotic is inexpensive， well-tolerated， and has a rea-sonably narrow spectrum. Oral therapy requires a 10-day course， although multiple daily doses for this duration may pose an issue with respect to compliance； penicillin Ⅴ500-mg bid dosing for 10 days in adults (as opposed to 250 mg tid or qid) is a reason-able alternative. For patients in whom compliance may be a significant issue， a single IM shot of 600，000 units of penicillin G benzathine in patients weighing <27 kg(1.2 million units if patient weighs >27 kg) is another option， although it requires an uncomfortable injection and， more significantly， it cannot be reversed or discontinued should an adverse reaction occur. All patients， regardless of final diagnosis， should be given adequate analgesia and reassurance. It has been shown that individuals who are perceived to want antibiotics may ultimately just want pain relief.\n\n【48】While somewhat controversial， some physicians recommend steroids as an anti-inflammatory agent to decrease the pain and swelling associated with GABS. A meta-analysis of over a thousand patients showed improvement 4.5 hours faster with steroids compared to placebo with a minimal reduction in pain scores. If clinically indicated， the standard agent is dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg up to 10 mg PO or IM.\n\n【49】Airway Complications\n\n【50】There are several life-threatening causes of sore throat. Patients may suffer airway obstruction from acute epiglottitis， peritonsillar abscess， retropharyngeal abscess， and Ludwig angina ； although less frequent， airway compromise may also occur with Vincent angina and diphtheria pharyngitis； the latter requires prompt diagnosis and treatment to avoid spread of this highly infectious condition. Manage-ment of the airway in these conditions 删除25：<u></u> sometimes neces-sitates emergency cricothyroidotomy ， because the pharynx and larynx may be edematous， distorted， or inflamed. Prompt identification of acute retrovi-ral syndrome from recent HIV infection can allow for rapid antiretroviral therapy. Infectious mononucleosis should be identified so that potentially serious sequela can be considered. These complications include splenomegaly that predisposes the patient to traumatic rupture of the spleen with relatively minor trauma； additionally， this splenomegaly can cause splenic sequestration and thrombocytopenia.\n\n| Table 1-2·COMPLICATED UPPER AIRWAY INFECTIONS  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Clinical Presentation  | Diagnosis  | Treatment  |\n| Epiglottitis  | Sudden onset of fever，drooling， tachypnea， stridor， toxic appearing  | Lateral cervi- cal radiograph(thumb-printingsign)  | Urgent ENT (ear， nose， throat) consultation forairway management Helium-O， mixture Cefu roxime antibiotictherapy  |\n| Retropharyngealabscess  | Usually child or if adult(trauma) Fever， sore throat， stiff neck， no trismus  | Lateral cervicalradiograph or CTimaging  | Stabilize airway Surgical drainage Antibiotics (penicillin andmetronidazole)  |\n| Ludwig angina  | Submaxillary， sublingual，or submental mass withelevation of tongue， jawswelling， fever， chills， trismus  | Lateral cervicalradiograph or CTimaging  | Stabilize airway Surgical drainage Antibiotics (penicillin andmetronidazole  |\n| Peritonsillarabscess  | Swelling in theperitonsillar region withuvula deviation， fever，sore throat， dysphagia，trismus  | Cervical radiographor CT imagingAspiration of theregion with pus  | Abscess drainage Antibiotic therapy (penicillinand metronidazole  |\n\n【52】删除3：<u>Figure 1-3.

Rheumatic fever is now rare in the United States(an incidence of <1 case per 100，000)， and is thought to be caused by only a handful of strains of GABS. Despite its rarity， rheumatic fever can result in highly morbid cardiac and neurological sequela； it also remains the most common cause of acquired heart disease in children and adolescents in some developing countries. Published literature suggests the GABS number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one case of rheumatic fever is between 53 and thousands depending on the endemic incidence of rheumatic fever. Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome is a very rare complication of pharyngitis. Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis， another feared complication of GABS pharyngitis， is also very rare， and it occurs with equal frequency in both anti-biotic-treated and nonantibiotic-treated groups. It is unclear if antibiotic therapy reduces the incidence of PANDAS， which is a clinical entity in development and presents with episodes of obsessive-compulsive behavior.\n\n【45】Prevention of the suppurative complications of GABS pharyngitis remains per-haps the most compelling reason for antibiotic therapy. These processes include Se tonsillopharyngeal cellulitis， peritonsillar and retropharyngeal abscesses， sinusitis， meningitis， brain abscess， and streptococcal bacteremia. The precise incidence of these complications is unclear， but what remains clear is that these are often prevent-able sequela that can have devastating consequences. Ultimately， the current prac-tice is to treat suspected GABS pharyngitis with an appropriate antibiotic.\n\n【46】Treatment ofGABS\n\n【47】Penicillin is the antibiotic of choice for GABS pharyngitis. A Cochrane review of the literature concluded that penicillin is the first choice antibiotic in patients with acute throat infections. The antibiotic is inexpensive， well-tolerated， and has a rea-sonably narrow spectrum. Oral therapy requires a 10-day course， although multiple daily doses for this duration may pose an issue with respect to compliance； penicillin Ⅴ500-mg bid dosing for 10 days in adults (as opposed to 250 mg tid or qid) is a reason-able alternative. For patients in whom compliance may be a significant issue， a single IM shot of 600，000 units of penicillin G benzathine in patients weighing <27 kg(1.2 million units if patient weighs >27 kg) is another option， although it requires an uncomfortable injection and， more significantly， it cannot be reversed or discontinued should an adverse reaction occur. All patients， regardless of final diagnosis， should be given adequate analgesia and reassurance. It has been shown that individuals who are perceived to want antibiotics may ultimately just want pain relief.\n\n【48】While somewhat controversial， some physicians recommend steroids as an anti-inflammatory agent to decrease the pain and swelling associated with GABS. A meta-analysis of over a thousand patients showed improvement 4.5 hours faster with steroids compared to placebo with a minimal reduction in pain scores. If clinically indicated， the standard agent is dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg up to 10 mg PO or IM.\n\n【49】Airway Complications\n\n【50】There are several life-threatening causes of sore throat. Patients may suffer airway obstruction from acute epiglottitis， peritonsillar abscess， retropharyngeal abscess， and Ludwig angina ； although less frequent， airway compromise may also occur with Vincent angina and diphtheria pharyngitis； the latter requires prompt diagnosis and treatment to avoid spread of this highly infectious condition. Manage-ment of the airway in these conditions 删除25：<u></u> sometimes neces-sitates emergency cricothyroidotomy ， because the pharynx and larynx may be edematous， distorted， or inflamed. Prompt identification of acute retrovi-ral syndrome from recent HIV infection can allow for rapid antiretroviral therapy. Infectious mononucleosis should be identified so that potentially serious sequela can be considered. These complications include splenomegaly that predisposes the patient to traumatic rupture of the spleen with relatively minor trauma； additionally， this splenomegaly can cause splenic sequestration and thrombocytopenia.\n\n| Table 1-2·COMPLICATED UPPER AIRWAY INFECTIONS  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Clinical Presentation  | Diagnosis  | Treatment  |\n| Epiglottitis  | Sudden onset of fever，drooling， tachypnea， stridor， toxic appearing  | Lateral cervi- cal radiograph(thumb-printingsign)  | Urgent ENT (ear， nose， throat) consultation forairway management Helium-O， mixture Cefu roxime antibiotictherapy  |\n| Retropharyngealabscess  | Usually child or if adult(trauma) Fever， sore throat， stiff neck， no trismus  | Lateral cervicalradiograph or CTimaging  | Stabilize airway Surgical drainage Antibiotics (penicillin andmetronidazole)  |\n| Ludwig angina  | Submaxillary， sublingual，or submental mass withelevation of tongue， jawswelling， fever， chills， trismus  | Lateral cervicalradiograph or CTimaging  | Stabilize airway Surgical drainage Antibiotics (penicillin andmetronidazole  |\n| Peritonsillarabscess  | Swelling in theperitonsillar region withuvula deviation， fever，sore throat， dysphagia，trismus  | Cervical radiographor CT imagingAspiration of theregion with pus  | Abscess drainage Antibiotic therapy (penicillinand metronidazole  |\n\n【52】删除3：<u>Figure 1-3.

During the examination， the clinician should be alert for complications of upper airway infec-tion； however， this patient presents with a simple pharyngitis.\n\n【21】Overall the most common etiology of pharyngitis is viral organisms.

Newer technologies， such as the optical immunoas-say， may prove to be as sensitive as throat cultures while providing results within minutes； its cost-effectiveness has not been established.\n\n【32】If RAT is available， then one accepted algorithm is given in Figure 1-1.\n\n【33】删除3：<u>Figure 1-1.

The possible exceptions to this 2-point rule are in the setting of a GABS outbreak， patient contact with many children， an immunocompromised patient， or a patient with recent expo-sure to someone with confirmed GABS.\n\n【41】Of note， antibiotic therapy in GABS pharyngitis has been de-emphasized because complications have become increasingly rare and the data to support the efficacy of antibiotic therapy in prevention of these complications is sparse and many decades old.\n\n【42】The complications of GABS can be classified into nonsuppurative and suppura-tive processes. The nonsuppurative complications of GABS pharyngitis include 删除换行1: aConsider antibiotics if in setting of GABS outbreak， patient had contact with many children， is immunocompromised， or recent exposure to a patient with documented GABS.\n\n【43】删除3：<u>Figure 1-2. Algorithm when RAT unavailable.</u>\n\n【44】rheumatic fever， streptococcal toxic shock syndrome， poststreptococcal glomeru-lonephritis， and PANDAS (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder asso-ciated with group A streptococci). Rheumatic fever is now rare in the United States(an incidence of <1 case per 100，000)， and is thought to be caused by only a handful of strains of GABS. Despite its rarity， rheumatic fever can result in highly morbid cardiac and neurological sequela； it also remains the most common cause of acquired heart disease in children and adolescents in some developing countries. Published literature suggests the GABS number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one case of rheumatic fever is between 53 and thousands depending on the endemic incidence of rheumatic fever. Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome is a very rare complication of pharyngitis. Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis， another feared complication of GABS pharyngitis， is also very rare， and it occurs with equal frequency in both anti-biotic-treated and nonantibiotic-treated groups. It is unclear if antibiotic therapy reduces the incidence of PANDAS， which is a clinical entity in development and presents with episodes of obsessive-compulsive behavior.\n\n【45】Prevention of the suppurative complications of GABS pharyngitis remains per-haps the most compelling reason for antibiotic therapy. These processes include Se tonsillopharyngeal cellulitis， peritonsillar and retropharyngeal abscesses， sinusitis， meningitis， brain abscess， and streptococcal bacteremia. The precise incidence of these complications is unclear， but what remains clear is that these are often prevent-able sequela that can have devastating consequences. Ultimately， the current prac-tice is to treat suspected GABS pharyngitis with an appropriate antibiotic.\n\n【46】Treatment ofGABS\n\n【47】Penicillin is the antibiotic of choice for GABS pharyngitis. A Cochrane review of the literature concluded that penicillin is the first choice antibiotic in patients with acute throat infections. The antibiotic is inexpensive， well-tolerated， and has a rea-sonably narrow spectrum. Oral therapy requires a 10-day course， although multiple daily doses for this duration may pose an issue with respect to compliance； penicillin Ⅴ500-mg bid dosing for 10 days in adults (as opposed to 250 mg tid or qid) is a reason-able alternative. For patients in whom compliance may be a significant issue， a single IM shot of 600，000 units of penicillin G benzathine in patients weighing <27 kg(1.2 million units if patient weighs >27 kg) is another option， although it requires an uncomfortable injection and， more significantly， it cannot be reversed or discontinued should an adverse reaction occur. All patients， regardless of final diagnosis， should be given adequate analgesia and reassurance. It has been shown that individuals who are perceived to want antibiotics may ultimately just want pain relief.\n\n【48】While somewhat controversial， some physicians recommend steroids as an anti-inflammatory agent to decrease the pain and swelling associated with GABS. A meta-analysis of over a thousand patients showed improvement 4.5 hours faster with steroids compared to placebo with a minimal reduction in pain scores. If clinically indicated， the standard agent is dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg up to 10 mg PO or IM.\n\n【49】Airway Complications\n\n【50】There are several life-threatening causes of sore throat. Patients may suffer airway obstruction from acute epiglottitis， peritonsillar abscess， retropharyngeal abscess， and Ludwig angina ； although less frequent， airway compromise may also occur with Vincent angina and diphtheria pharyngitis； the latter requires prompt diagnosis and treatment to avoid spread of this highly infectious condition. Manage-ment of the airway in these conditions 删除25：<u></u> sometimes neces-sitates emergency cricothyroidotomy ， because the pharynx and larynx may be edematous， distorted， or inflamed. Prompt identification of acute retrovi-ral syndrome from recent HIV infection can allow for rapid antiretroviral therapy. Infectious mononucleosis should be identified so that potentially serious sequela can be considered. These complications include splenomegaly that predisposes the patient to traumatic rupture of the spleen with relatively minor trauma； additionally， this splenomegaly can cause splenic sequestration and thrombocytopenia.\n\n| Table 1-2·COMPLICATED UPPER AIRWAY INFECTIONS  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Clinical Presentation  | Diagnosis  | Treatment  |\n| Epiglottitis  | Sudden onset of fever，drooling， tachypnea， stridor， toxic appearing  | Lateral cervi- cal radiograph(thumb-printingsign)  | Urgent ENT (ear， nose， throat) consultation forairway management Helium-O， mixture Cefu roxime antibiotictherapy  |\n| Retropharyngealabscess  | Usually child or if adult(trauma) Fever， sore throat， stiff neck， no trismus  | Lateral cervicalradiograph or CTimaging  | Stabilize airway Surgical drainage Antibiotics (penicillin andmetronidazole)  |\n| Ludwig angina  | Submaxillary， sublingual，or submental mass withelevation of tongue， jawswelling， fever， chills， trismus  | Lateral cervicalradiograph or CTimaging  | Stabilize airway Surgical drainage Antibiotics (penicillin andmetronidazole  |\n| Peritonsillarabscess  | Swelling in theperitonsillar region withuvula deviation， fever，sore throat， dysphagia，trismus  | Cervical radiographor CT imagingAspiration of theregion with pus  | Abscess drainage Antibiotic therapy (penicillinand metronidazole  |\n\n【52】删除3：<u>Figure 1-3.

Her pain began in the peri-umbilical region and has now migrated toward the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. Her serum HCG is negative. A surgery con-sult is obtained， and based on her history physical， and findings sugges-tive of acute appendicitis seen on abdominal CT scan， she is scheduled for emergency appendectomy. The patient is otherwise healthy and takes no regular medications. Her surgical history includes a tonsillec-tomy at age 10， and a dilatation and curettage (D&C) at age 25. She has not had problems with previous anesthetics.\n\n【2】 What would you include in your preoperative evaluation of this patient!\n\n【3】What medications will you use for induction and maintenance of anesthesia?\n\n【4】\\> How will you manage postoperative pain in this patient?\n\n【5】ANSWERS TO CASE 11：\n\n【6】Anesthesia for Emergency Appendectomy\n\n【7】Summary： A healthy woman presents with acute appendicitis. The urgent nature of the surgery precludes any delay due to risk of rupture and subsequent peritonitis.\n\n【8】\\> Preoperative evaluation： Complete history and physical examination， and time of last ingestion of food or contrast. Because of her age and healthy sta-tus， no laboratory tests are required.\n\n【9】\\>Medications used for induction and maintenance of anesthesia：\n\n【10】Combination of a narcotic， an inhalational agent， and a muscle relaxant. The patient will receive general anesthesia， with a rapid sequence induction to minimize the chances of aspiration. The choice of induction agent will not significantly impact her hemodynamic status， as the patient is neither hypovolemic nor hypotensive.\n\n【11】\\> How to manage postoperative pain： Postoperative pain is managed with intravenous narcotics. Other postoperative issues that may present are nau sea， vomiting， and ileus.\n\n【12】ANALYSIS\n\n【13】Objectives\n\n【14】1\\. Consider the elements of the preoperative evaluation and optimization prior to emergency abdominal surgery (airway examination， comorbidities， hemodynamic status， perforated vs. nonperforated appendicitis， NPO guidelines， and other testing as indicated by the patient's comorbidities).\n\n【15】2\\. Understand the techniques used in patients with “full stomachs\"including rapid sequence induction and aspiration prophylaxis.\n\n【16】3\\. Consideration implication of surgical procedure on anesthesia： full stom-ach precautions and rapid sequence induction， laparoscopic versus open appendectomy， fluid management， premedication， prophylaxis for postop-erative nausea and vomiting， postoperative pain control.\n\n【17】Considerations\n\n【18】Several special considerations are warranted in this healthy， young woman scheduled for an emergency surgical procedure. Appendectomy is a minor surgical procedure with a low probability of significant blood loss， so an adequately running peripheral intravenous suffices for intravenous access.\n\n【19】A physical examination and review of the patient's vital signs can help deter-mine the patient's volume status aanndd hemodynamic stability. Volume-depleted patients should receive resuscitative fluids before proceeding with anesthesia. Many patients presenting with acute appendicitis are febrile and tachycardic at baseline， so a“tilt test\" may be helpful to determine degree of intravascular depletion.\n\n【20】Since the patient is of reproductive age， it is important to inquire about the possibility of pregnancy. Many institutions routinely perform preg-nancy tests i1n women of reproductive age undergoing surgery； others inquire， and a pregnancy test may be performed if the history indicates such a possibility.\n\n【21】The anesthetic plan in this patient is general anesthesia with endotra-cheal intubation， controlled mechanical ventilation， and standard moni-toring. Since the procedure is an emergency， the patient is unlikely to have fasted as she would have before a scheduled surgical procedure. Moreover， pain in and of itself reduces gastric emptying. Thus she is said to have a “full stomach，”and will thus require precautions to prevent the aspiration of gastric contents. In the operating room， the standard monitors are applied， and the patient is preoxygenated (≥3 minutes). Anesthesia is induced with propofol 1.5 to 2.5 mg/kg. Cricoid pressure (Sellick maneu-ver) is applied by an assistant to reduce the risk of passive regurgitation of gastric contents. Succinylcholine 1 to 2 mg/kg is administered for paralysis， and the patient is intubated.\n\n【22】Patients are typically paralyzed for abdominal surgery in order to facilitate exposure of the surgical field， and minimize trauma to the abdominal muscles. Once the patient recovers from the short-acting neuromuscular blocker， suc-cinylcholine， she is treated with a longer-acting， nondepolarizing blocker， vecuronium.\n\n【23】Two potential postoperative problems are optimally addressed preemp-tively， and prior to emergence. First， morphine 0.1 mg/kg is administered during the case as an adjuvant to anesthesia and for postoperative pain relief. Second， young women are most likely to experience postoperative nausea and vomiting. Ondansetron， 4 mg， is given in the last 15 minutes of case to reduce the incidence of this unpleasant complication.\n\n【24】At the end of the surgery， the patient's muscle relaxation is reversed with neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg and glycopyrrolate 0.01 mg/kg. Before she is fully responsive， the normal airway reflexes are absent， and she is unable to protect her airway from the aspiration of stomach contents. She is extubated once shee11Salert， following commands， and showsgood strength. Following extubation， the patient is transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for postoperative care.\n\n【25】APPROACH TO Anesthesia for Emergency Appendectomy\n\n【26】DEFINITIONS\n\n【27】PREOXYGENATION： Since room air is only 21% oxygen， and since the patient will be paralyzed and apneic during intubation， it is desirable for the patient to have additional oxygen reserves. This is accomplished by asking her to breathe 100% oxygen for 3 minutes prior to induction. Alternatively， six large breaths of 100% oxygen have been shown to be equally effective.\n\n【28】In addition to inspiring oxygen，“denitrogenation”also occurs as the nitro-gen in plasma， which reflects the nitrogen concentration in room air， seeks equilibrium， and diffuses out across the alveolus. This process of denitrogenation is actually as important as the inspiration of oxygenation in preventing alveolar hypoxia and hypoxemia. The rationale for preoxygenation is that in the event that a patient cannot be ventilated or intubated， he or she will have adequate oxygen in reserve to survive long enough to awaken and resume breathing.\n\n【29】RAPID SEQUENCE INDUCTION (RSI)： A technique of rapid induction and intubation used to minimize the risk of aspiration. It involves preoxygenation by mask， the administration of an intravenous induction agent immediately followed by a rapid acting neuromuscular blocking drug， and the use of cricoid pressure. Mask ventilation before endotracheal intubation is avoided to pre-vent insufflation of gas into the patient's stomach.\n\n【30】CRICOID PRESSURE (SELLICK MANEUVER)： Cricoid pressure is the pos-terior displacement of the cricoid cartilage against the vertebral body in attempt to occlude the esophagus. It is applied by an assistant before the loss of consciousness (and protective airway reflexes)， and is released only after correct placement of the endotracheal tube has been confirmed.\n\n【31】SUCCINYLCHOLINE： A depolarizing neuromuscular blocker often used for rapid sequence induction because of its rapid onset (usually <60 seconds). Potential side effects include myalgias， bradycardia and arrhythmias，hyper-kalemia in certain patients (recent burn injury， upper and lower motor neuron disease， prolonged bed rest， muscular dystrophies， and closed head injuries). Succinylcholine can trigger malignant hyperthermia in susceptible patients.\n\n【32】MALIGNANT HYPERTHERMIA (MH)： A potentially lethal hypermetabolic syndrome that occurs in susceptible patients after exposure to a triggering anesthetic agent. The presenting signs include tachycardia， acidosis， hyper-carbia， sustained muscle contraction， hypoxemia， and hyperthermia. Common triggering agents include succinylcholine， and volatile anesthetics including halothane， enflurane， desflurane， sevoflurane， and isoflurane.\n\n【33】POSTOPERATIVE NAUSEA AND VOMITING (PONV)： A common side effect seen in patients undergoing general anesthesia. Risk factors include prior history of postoperative nausea， motion sickness， major abdominal sur-gery， nonsmoker， female gender， and use of opioids.\n\n【34】CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【35】Aspiration\n\n【36】The American Society of Anesthesiologists has described and standardized guide-lines for fasting or“NPO (nothing by mouth) Guidelines” for patients prior to elective surgery. The guidelines require an abstinence from clear liquids for2 hours， and from milk or a light meal for 6 hours. But the patients undergoing emergency surgery are in a different category. Pain， trauma， and abdominal emer-gencies are associated with a delay in gastric emptying， thus increasing the risk of these patients for the aspiration of gastric contents. Certain diseases， such as dia-betes delay gastric transit time and may also pose an aspiration risk. Other condi-tions associated with increased aspiration risk are ileus， obesity， pregnancy， hiatal hernia， scleroderma， and altered mental status which occurs following stroke.\n\n【37】The risk of aspiration with anesthesia is 5 events per 10，000 anesthetics. Since the mortality from aspiration is significant and varies from 3% to 70%， all patients presenting for emergency surgery should be treated as though they have a full stomach. Early studies showed that the risk of aspiration and the resulting damage to the respiratory mucosa increase with a gastric volume of more than 25 mL and pH less than 2.5. So some practitioners attempt to reduce the volume and increase the pH of the gastric contents. Non-particulate antacids such as sodium citrate decrease the acidity， but increase gastric volume. Histamine receptor antagonists such as ranitidine decrease the secretion of gastric acid， but do not affect the acidity of the contents already present in the stomach (thus reducing the value of their administration just prior to an anesthetic). Metoclopramide stimulates gastric emptying， and increases the lower esophageal sphincter tone. Anticholinergic drugs like gly-copyrrolate decrease the gastric secretions， but also decrease the lower esophageal sphincter tone， an undesirable trait in the presence of a full stom-ach. However， none of these drugs have been shown to alter the incidence of aspiration， and none of them are approved bby the Foodand Drug Administration for aspiration prophylaxis.\n\n【38】The use of a nasogastric tube to decompress the stomach is common， but controversial， as it does not guarantee gastric emptying. Somewhat paradoxi-cally， a nasogastric tube may actually be detrimental by mechanically decreas-ing tone of the upper and lower esophageal sphincters， and acting as a “wick”to facilitate the movement of gastric contents into the pharynx.\n\n【39】Patients presenting for abdominal emergencies can also present with ileus. Factors predisposing for ileus include narcotics， antacids， anticoagulants， 删除换行1: phenothiazines， ganglionic blockers， metabolic derangements like hypona-tremia， hypokalemia， hypomagnesemia， sepsis， infection， and inflammation.Ileus can also persist in the postoperative period as well. Small bowel func-tion commonly recovers within a day and gastric motility within 1 to 2 days. However， colonic motility can take up to 5 days. Thus even though patients status post abdominal surgery may have been fasted， they still require atten-tion to the risk of aspiration if an additional operation is required.\n\n【40】Preoperative Optimization： Resuscitation of Blood Volume\n\n【41】Patients presenting with an acute abdomen are often quite dehydrated as a result of vomiting and loss of fluids into the intestine. This may be reflected as tachycardia， oliguria， altered sensorium， decrease in skin turgor， dry mucus membranes， and orthostatic hypotension. It may also manifest as increased vari-ation of pulse pressure with respiration， if not outright tachycardia. An elevated hematocrit is suggestive of dehydration， and serum electrolytes may be abnor-mal since severe vomiting can lead to metabolic alkalosis due to loss of gastric acid. Patients should receive adequate and appropriate volume resuscitation prior to the induction of anesthesia to prevent significant hypotension due to vasodilation caused by some anesthetic drugs， as well as the removal of the patient's endogenous sympathetic responses to pain once anesthesia is induced.\n\n【42】The anesthetic options for an open appendectomy are general anesthesia or central neuraxial anesthesia. The usual Ppractice is general anesthesia， using a rapid sequence induction and tracheal intubation. Previously known as a“crash”induction， the rapid sseeqquueence induction is not without hazard. Complications include failure to ventilate due to closure of the vocal cords， cricoid ring fracture， esophagealrupture， and profound hypotension. It involves the application of cricoid pressure to minimize the risk of aspiration. First described by Sellick in 1961， it is designed to cause temporary occlusion of the upper end of the esophagus by posterior pressure of the cricoid cartilage ring against the cervical vertebra. Active vomiting， cervical spine injury， and tracheal injury are contraindications to the use of cricoid pressure.\n\n【43】Propofol is most frequently used as the induction agent of choice due to its rapid onset， short duration of action， and smooth and pleasing emergence. However， propofol causes vasodilation， so its use presupposes that the patient is well hydrated and not demonstrating signs of hypovolemia. The typical dose of propofol is 1.5 to 2.5 mg/kg for induction， although the individual dose requirement varies markedly. In patients in whom hypotension is a con-cern， ketamine (1 mg/kg i.v.) or etomidate (0.1-0.4 mg/kg i.v.) are suitable alternatives. Because of its rapid onset， succinylcholine (1-1.5 mg/kg i.v.) is the neuromuscular blocking drug of choice in rapid sequence inductions. Its short duration allows the paralyzed patient， who can neither be ventilated nor intubated， to resume breathing promptly， thus lessening the likelihood of morbidity when compared to the longer-acting neuromuscular agents.\n\n【44】Once intubation is accomplished and proper endotracheal tube placement is confirmed， cricoid pressure can be released. If intubation is unsuccessful， cricoid pressure should be maintained continuously during subsequent intu-bation attempts and during mask ventilation.\n\n【45】Another possible approach is neuraxial anesthesia (such as spinal). Indeed， spinal may be preferred in pregnant patients in order to minimize the systemic concentrations of general anesthetics. However， the sensory level required for a routine appendectomy is T4， which is quite high.\n\n【46】An open appendectomy is a short procedure， hence the anesthetic agents used should have a short half-life to facilitate quick emergence. Desflurane and sevoflurane have low blood-gas partition coefficients， thus low solubility in blood， and are suitable for short procedures. The role of nitrous oxide in the maintenance of anesthesia is controversial due to its effect on bowel disten tion and postoperative nausea and vomiting. Muscle relaxants are required for adequate surgical visualization. In general， intermediate-acting nondepolariz-ing agents are used in appropriate doses.\n\n【47】It is important to ensure that the patient is awake and following commands prior to extubation. If a patient can follow commands， then his or her laryngeal reflexes， which enable the larynx to close during vomiting， are likely to be intact. Conversely， patients who are unable to follow commands are also unlikely to be able to protect their own airways.\n\n【48】If a patient vomits， the head of the bed should be dropped ten degrees and the pharynx suctioned. Intact laryngeal reflexes enable the patient to clear secretions and protect their airway. Respiratory criteria for extubation include adequate tidal volumes， a normal respiratory rate， and the ability to cough and breathe deeply. A sustained head lift lasting 5 seconds typically predicts that the muscle relaxants have been successfully reversed.\n\n【49】Postoperative Complications\n\n【50】Nausea and vomiting are troublesome complications of anesthesia， especially in young women. The etiology of postoperative nausea and vomiting is mul-tifactorial. The vomiting centre is located in the area postrema of the brain-stem and receives vagalafferents from the gastrointestinaltract. Selective serotonin receptor antagonists like ondansetron， dolasetron， and granisetron have proven to be effective in alleviating postoperative nausea and vomiting with minimal side effects when administered just prior to the end of a case. Other classes of drugs including anticholinergics， dopamine antagonists and antihistamines may also be utilized， but have significant side effects. Clonidine， dexamethasone， and acupuncture have also been found to be effective. Combination of therapies for the prevention of postoperative nau-sea and vomiting provides maximal benefit.\n\n【51】The management of postoperative pain should begin in the operating room. The goal is to minimize any potential sensitization of the spinal cord and brain propagated by tissue injury and pain stimuli. One method of the 删除换行1: preemptive analgesia involves central neuraxial blockade. However， if a gen-eral anesthetic is used， local field block in the area of the incision is effective as well. Opioids are most widely used to control postoperative pain but have significant side effects like ileus， respiratory depression， nausea， and vomiting. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may also be used for post-operative pain control in these patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:13:11", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:14:11", "cost": 59.729}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:01", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:14:08", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:13:08"}

Over the last 6 months, her headaches have increased in intensity and frequency, leaving her experiencing intense, pounding, right-sided headaches associated with nausea and occasionally vomiting. During the headaches she is unable to tolerate head movement, bright light, or sounds of any sort. They typically last up to 8 hours. She tried over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory analgesics with some relief but only if the headaches are not severe at the onset. Her neurologic examination was normal as was the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her brain with and without contrast and basic laboratory tests. You diagnose her with chronic migraines and prescribe prophylactic medication. Over the next 3 months, you prescribe for the patient numerous migraine prophylaxis agents, including topiramate, propranolol, and amitriptyline. Despite adequate trials, these medications were not particularly effective. Finally, you prescribe divalproex sodium (Depakote) 750 mg by mouth twice daily, and this medication successfully reduced her migraine frequency to twice per month. You also prescribe a course of amoxicillin for the patient at that visit because you suspect she has an infection. At your next follow-up visit, the patient complains of fatigue and nausea, so you perform a pregnancy test. The results of that test are positive. The patient was surprised because she had been taking the same low-dose estrogen oral contraceptive pill daily for years without ever becoming pregnant. After she returned home, she spent hours on the Internet researching the teratogenicity of divalproex and the interaction between antibiotics and her oral contraceptive pill. Later that week, you receive an angry e-mail accusing you of malpractice. She promptly transferred her medical care to another physician.\n\n【3】 Is this a likely case of medical malpractice?\n\n【4】 What steps should you take now that you have received the patient’s e-mail?\n\n【5】### ANSWERS TO CASE 36:\n\n【6】#### Risk Management\n\n【7】Summary : A 30-year-old gravida 0 woman was started on divalproex sodium for migraine headache prophylaxis (a pregnancy category X for migraine headache prophylaxis but category D for seizures) and becomes unexpectedly pregnant despite taking oral contraception regularly. The pregnancy is the result of a drug interaction with an antibiotic that reduced the efficacy of the oral contraception she was taking. The patient is upset by both the unplanned pregnancy and the potential for iatrogenic fetal harm. You receive an e-mail from the patient accusing you of malpractice.\n\n【8】 Is this likely a case of medical malpractice? Yes.\n\n【9】 What steps should you take now that you have received the patient’s e-mail ? You must discuss the issue with your risk management team and consider an apology and disclosure of the medical error.\n\n【10】### ANALYSIS\n\n【11】##### Objectives\n\n【12】1\\. To understand the basic theory behind medical malpractice lawsuits.\n\n【13】2\\. To understand how the legal system understands the duties of physicians to their patients.\n\n【14】##### Considerations\n\n【15】In the present case, the physician prescribed a teratogenic medication to a woman of reproductive age and simultaneously prescribed an antibiotic known to cause decreased efficacy of oral contraceptives without recommending a backup form of contraception. This is an example of medical malpractice. All of the elements of a malpractice suit are present: The physician owed the patient a duty of care, the physician breached this duty, the patient was harmed, and the physician’s actions were the cause of the harm. This is also an example of medical error, and the physician should consider full disclosure to the patient with an apology.\n\n【16】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【17】#### Medical Malpractice\n\n【18】### DEFINITIONS\n\n【19】INFORMED CONSENT : A patient with decision-making capacity has the right to accept or refuse medical interventions. The informed consent process consists of several steps: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> the physician introduces the concept of the informed consent process as one of mutual decision making, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> the physician elicits the patient’s current understanding of her condition and alternatives for management, 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> the physician provides additional information about the patient’s condition and alternatives for management, including the option of doing nothing 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> the physician assists the patient in understanding the material presented, 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> the patient articulates her decision to the physician, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u> after further discussion and agreement, the management decision is carried out by the physician.\n\n【20】MEDICAL MALPRACTICE : The negligent or improper provision of medical care by a licensed health care professional.\n\n【21】MEDICAL NEGLIGENCE : A plaintiff must prove the following four elements to prevail in a medical negligence lawsuit: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> the physician owed the plaintiff a duty of care, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> the physician breeched that duty (deviated from the standard of care), 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> the plaintiff suffered an injury, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> the physician’s actions were the proximate cause of the plaintiff’s injury.\n\n【22】PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE : The evidentiary standard in medical negligence cases requires that the plaintiff prove the facts by a preponderance of the evidence. This requires demonstrating to the jury that the facts the plaintiff alleges were more likely than not to have occurred.\n\n【23】PROXIMATE CAUSE : But for the physician’s action, the plaintiff would not have suffered harm. The proximate cause does not have to be the immediate cause, but the physician’s allegedly negligent actions must have set up a series of events that led to the harm.\n\n【24】STANDARD OF CARE : Based on expert testimony, a jury is asked to determine what a reasonably prudent medical specialist in the same specialty as the defendant physician would have done in the same circumstances as the defendant physician. Typically, the standard of care is based on a national, not a local, standard.\n\n【25】### CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【26】##### Malpractice Basics\n\n【27】When filing a malpractice lawsuit in civil court, the patient alleges that the treating physician cared for the plaintiff in a manner that deviated from nationally accepted norms and resulted in injury. To win a medical malpractice claim, the plaintiff must demonstrate each of the 4 elements of a negligence claim. The elements are as follows:\n\n【28】1\\. The plaintiff must show that a physician-patient relationship existed, thus creating a duty of care. The physician–patient relationship inherently imposes this duty.\n\n【29】2\\. The plaintiff must prove that the physician’s actions were negligent, in that they deviated from nationally accepted professional standards, by proffering expert testimony that a reasonably prudent physician would have acted differently under the same circumstances.\n\n【30】3\\. The plaintiff must demonstrate that he or she suffered physical, emotional, and/or financial injury.\n\n【31】4\\. The plaintiff must establish that the physician’s action was the proximate cause of the injury.\n\n【32】Unlike the more familiar “beyond a reasonable doubt” standard of criminal cases, in a medical malpractice case, the plaintiff must prove the 4 elements “by the preponderance of the evidence” (51% certainty), a much more lenient evidentiary standard.\n\n【33】### ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION\n\n【34】A variety of actions, if found to deviate from the standard of care, may form the basis of a negligence lawsuit. Negligent actions may reflect poor quality medical care including misdiagnosis, mismanagement of a disease process, or an improperly performed procedure. Allegations of negligence may also arise from unprofessional behavior. In addition, negligence may arise from a physician’s failure to obtain adequate informed consent for a treatment. Under this theory of negligence, the plaintiff claims that the physician did not provide either the patient or the patient’s surrogate enough information about the risks and benefits of a treatment to make an informed decision about whether to accept or reject a proposed intervention. <sup><a></a><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【35】In this case, the patient may have 2 theories of negligence on which to base a malpractice lawsuit: inadequate informed consent and poor quality medical care. Valproate-containing medications present a particularly heightened risk of adverse effects to the developing fetus. If the fetus experiences an adverse outcome, then the physician’s liability exposure will depend, in part, on how thoroughly the physician discussed with the patient the risks and benefits of taking divalproex sodium, which is a known teratogen. Ideally, the physician discussed the teratogenic potential of the medication at the time the medication was offered and documented this discussion in the medical record. A woman of childbearing potential may reasonably expect to be informed about the heightened potential fetal harm should she become pregnant while taking a particularly potent teratogen. Thus, a physician who does not know enough to discuss the risks and benefits of a therapy or forgets to do so is providing poor medical care and inadequate informed consent.\n\n【36】Another complication of this case is that the patient became pregnant around the time that the physician prescribed her an antibiotic known to reduce the efficacy of her oral contraceptive medication. The physician’s liability exposure depends on whether and how the patient was counseled about the drug–drug interaction. The physician may have missed the fact that the patient was taking an oral contraceptive pill. Alternatively, the physician may not have been aware of the drug–drug interaction and thus did not know to counsel the patient to take extra contraceptive precautions during the time of antibiotic use. These errors in either procedure (medicine reconciliation) or knowledge (ignorance of drug–drug interactions) may also form the basis of a malpractice lawsuit for negligence.\n\n【37】This case also raises the question of apologies for medical errors. Although a thorough review of the topic of apologies for medical error is beyond the scope of this case, physicians should be aware that states approach the admissibility of apologies during a medical malpractice lawsuit differently. Ethically, physicians are expected to offer some type of apology for a medical error. The current legal protections for physicians are inadequate in most states to facilitate free communication with patients and families after a medical error has been committed. Although some states have no law in this area, the majority of states have apology laws. Apology laws typically protect only the actual expression of sympathy but not the expression of fault that may accompany the expression of sympathy. A minority of states has disclosure laws. These laws mandate disclosure of certain unanticipated outcomes and may protect the communication from being used against the physician in a legal or administrative action. Knowing the law and working with local risk management personnel is advisable in these difficult situations when a medical error has been made.\n\n【38】###", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:11:06", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:12:04", "cost": 58.158}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:01", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:12:04", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:11:06"}

As with adults, the content of these symptoms can vary widely across affected individuals requiring skill and flexibility of the treating clinician. One particularly challenging presentation involves scrupulosity , the class of symptoms centering on themes of religion and morality. In this chapter, we provide an overview of the phenomenology, impact, and treatment of scrupulosity in children and adolescents. We discuss unique issues related to the assessment of these symptoms, recognizing that they often overlap with deeply held religious and cultural beliefs. We then summarize current evidence-based treatment for scrupulosity and provide an illustrative case that was successfully treated with behavioral intervention.\n\n【12】Scrupulosity is defined as a form of OCD involving religious or moral obsessions. Affected individuals may be excessively concerned that they have committed sins, violated religious or moral dictates, or thought or behaved in a way that indicates that they are dishonest or immoral. As with other OCD symptom clusters, scrupulosity symptoms are heterogeneous and can take many forms. Some youths may have persistent concerns about offending religious figureheads. Others may exhibit pathological doubt or worry about having sinned or transgressed. Still others may engage in compulsive praying, confessing, or other excessive religious behavior. Notably, although the majority of scrupulosity symptoms involve obsessions and compulsions related to religion, they need not be contained to this topic 删除10：<u>(Abramowitz et al. 2002 )</u>; other forms of scrupulosity may involve excessive concern with morality, including worries about wastefulness, dishonesty, and other forms of ethical rightness or perfection.\n\n【13】There has been relatively little systematic study of scrupulosity in child and adolescent populations. In adults, scrupulosity is the fifth most common class of OCD symptoms 删除10：<u>(Foa and Kozak 1995 )</u>, making it a somewhat common part of the clinical presentation. Meta-analysis of the Yale–Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale 删除10：<u>(Y–BOCS; Goodman et al. 1989 )</u> indicates that scrupulosity clusters with symptoms involving forbidden thoughts, including aggressive, sexual, and somatic obsessions 删除10：<u>(Bloch et al. 2008 )</u>. This symptom cluster has received additional support from confirmatory factor analysis with a mixed-age sample of children, adolescents, and adults 删除10：<u>(Stewart et al. 2008 )</u>. Other studies of mixed-age participants, including children and adolescents, reveal that scrupulosity occurs in nearly a quarter of individuals affected by OCD 删除10：<u>(Antony et al. 1998 )</u>. Although there has yet to be research directly assessing its prevalence in pediatric OCD , there is much to suggest that scrupulosity occurs with some degree of frequency in youth populations.\n\n【14】What is perhaps more clear is that scrupulosity is among the more difficult OCD symptoms to treat 删除10：<u>(Nelson et al. 2006 )</u>. For individuals of any age, there are challenges of parsing normative religious practice (e.g. prayer, confession) or spiritual fervor from that which is obsessive or compulsive. In general, this distinction is made based on the extent to which specified religious behavior is out of line with that of other observers of the faith. Scrupulous behavior exceeds what a given religion calls for, and it may even be focused on aspects of ideology that are considered trivial. In addition, an individual with scrupulosity may selectively pick and choose which aspects of religion to observe and which to disregard in ways that appear arbitrary and irrational.\n\n【15】Because the distinction between religiosity and scrupulosity often falls within a grey area, the treating clinician must demonstrate sensitivity for both the individual and his or her cultural beliefs and practices. They must have sound understanding of the religions practiced by their patients and be familiar with their basic tenets, while remembering that, even within a given religion, there is variability in practices and beliefs from person to person. Moreover, clinicians must be adroit at working with individuals who view their deep commitment to their faith as a defining feature of their identity. Insight about these symptoms may be limited and the act of challenging religious beliefs may be viewed as akin to total defection from faith and values.\n\n【16】These challenges are common to working with all scrupulosity symptoms. However, children and adolescents present with a unique set of issues that may further complicate assessment and treatment. Youths are embedded in a family context in which religion has been chosen for them and issues of morality learned through formal lessons and/or parental modeling. Taught to listen to their elders, children and adolescents may feel a particular sense of obligation to carry through with ritualistic practices. Moreover, their developmental status may limit their ability to think abstractly about the issues at hand (e.g. “What does it mean to really offend God?” “Does thinking something mean that you mean it?”).\n\n【17】Exposure-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), currently the gold standard for most forms of OCD, is an efficacious psychosocial treatment approach for symptoms of scrupulosity. Used alone or in conjunction with pharmacotherapy (i.e. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), it is the cornerstone of treatment 删除10：<u>(for practice parameters, see Geller and March 2012 )</u>. As detailed elsewhere in this volume, traditional CBT for OCD involves triggering obsessive thoughts via exposure tasks and prompting patients to resist the corresponding urge to ritualize. In addition, some CBT protocols include cognitive restructuring (i.e. identifying irrational or intrusive thoughts and challenging them with more realistic thoughts). Although useful in many cases, we urge caution with cognitive restructuring techniques when treating scrupulosity, given that some youths may have difficulty mastering the abstract reasoning skills they require 删除10：<u>(Kingery et al. 2006 ; Weisz and Weersing 1999 )</u>. Moreover, “thought challenging” may be used by some youngsters as a type of mental compulsion wherein they attempt to neutralize or combat an intrusive thought with a competing, alternate thought. In light of these considerations, we recommend that use of cognitive restructuring as a symptom management technique be limited or excluded from treatment altogether.\n\n【18】Case Description\n----------------\n\n【19】The complexities of assessing and treating scrupulosity are illustrated through our work with Sarah, an 11-year-old Caucasian female who was brought by her mother to a specialty treatment clinic for evaluation of “worries” and chronic reassurance-seeking. Sarah lived with her parents and three older siblings, all of whom practiced Orthodox Judaism, and she presented with concerns that were specific to her faith as well as those that were more generally concerned with conscientious, ethical behavior.\n\n【20】The Presenting Problem\n----------------------\n\n【21】When Sarah first came to our clinic, she reported that she was committing sins “all the time.” This was because she experienced intrusive thoughts about offending God by using his name in vain (e.g. “Oh my god,” “God damn”) and other thoughts that made her question whether she was complying with the principles of the Ten Commandments (e.g. not believing in God, disrespecting her parents, offending others when she spoke). She described significant distress because she believed God would punish her for transgressing against the Torah. Sarah felt that the only way to compensate for her moral transgressions was to engage in prayer, and she prayed multiple times per day, including up to 2 h before bed. This prayer took on a particularly ritualistic form in that if she became distracted or made a mistake, she would need to begin her prayers from the beginning to make sure they were delivered perfectly. Similarly, if she asked her mother to pray aloud and she experienced an intrusive thought during her mother’s prayer, she would ask her mother to repeat that portion of the prayer over multiple times until Sarah felt that she had adequately paid attention to the prayer. Sarah indicated that the intrusive thoughts were bothersome and upsetting to her. At the same time, she viewed her prayer and other compulsive behavior as an appropriate and normal part of her religious faith.\n\n【22】Sarah’s mother corroborated much of this account. She indicated that Sarah constantly sought reassurance from family members and that she confessed throughout the day to her parents and her eldest brother. Sarah’s mother also described compulsive confessing related to doubting God, reassurance-seeking about the Torah’s principles of faith, and frequent petitions for someone to pray with her. Importantly, Sarah’s mother was less concerned with Sarah’s religious practices than she was with Sarah’s preoccupation with a strict moral code. In particular, she reported that Sarah was terrified of wastefulness and engaged in a variety of unusual behaviors to prevent it. For example, she would repeatedly check faucets to ensure that no drops of water escaped, pick up trash as she walked outside in order to recycle it, refuse to use paper towels to clean up spills or paper napkins during meals, and complete multiple school assignments in tiny writing on the same sheet of paper so as not to “waste” paper. Her mother indicated that Sarah sought reassurance about her perceived wastefulness many times per day and that she never appeared to be satisfied with how her family members responded.\n\n【23】Background\n----------\n\n【24】At the time of the initial interview, Sarah lived with her parents and three older siblings. Her father worked as a teacher at a non-secular high school, and her mother was a homemaker. Her family described themselves as “very observant” and noted that her oldest brother was studying to be a rabbi. All of Sarah’s immediate and extended family practiced Orthodox Judaism, and all were actively involved in their synagogue, including attending temple for weekly services and all holidays. Sarah also attended a weekly Hebrew school class on Sundays. Thus, the family’s immediate and extended community was similarly observant. Interestingly, this made it somewhat easy for Sarah’s mother to note that Sarah’s behavior was distinct from that of her siblings. Although Sarah’s siblings and peers prayed and strove to uphold the principles of their faith, they did not seem to need reassurance or to become upset if something was inadvertently wasted.\n\n【25】Sarah attended a Jewish day school, where students participated in prayer and a religion class daily. She obtained good grades and received generally good feedback from her teachers. Over the last school year, however, teachers had begun to comment that Sarah often used the same sheet of paper for multiple homework assignments, writing in tiny script on both sides of the page. When asked to use separate sheets of paper for different assignments, Sarah agreed initially but then continued to submit assignments on the same paper. Both parents and teachers noted that Sarah recently spent more time alone despite being a popular, well-liked girl.\n\n【26】Sarah’s parents had different approaches for responding to her requests for reassurance or prayer. Her mother described increasing frustration as Sarah’s requests began to occur multiple times per day. Her father felt that it was his responsibility to teach his children to abide by and be faithful to religious tenets, including the morals and values of upstanding citizenship. He was not concerned about Sarah’s prayer. He was, however, concerned by reports from her teachers describing her recent social withdrawal and the degree to which she tried to conserve paper in the classroom.\n\n【27】Sarah’s parents initially responded by seeking guidance from their rabbi on how to handle her worries and reassurance-seeking. Their rabbi discussed Jewish orthodoxy with the family and provided support for Sarah’s desire to be a faithful member of their community. However, he expressed concerns about Sarah’s recent isolation and her preoccupation with preventing wastefulness. He noted that her reassurance-seeking from family members was unusual in its frequency and persistence. Having some knowledge of anxiety and OCD, he encouraged the family to seek further evaluation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:35:57", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:36:35", "cost": 37.571}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:01", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:36:33", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:35:55"}

The patient denies that he is depressed or feeling stressed. He was doing well in his job as a security guard， working the night shift， until he was told that his position was being phased out and that in order to stay with the company， he would need to switch to the day shift. The patient agreed because he did not think that this would be a problem and did not want to lose his insurance benefits and retirement plan. However， after several months in his new position， he admits he is concerned that he is not doing as well in his new position. His previous position allowed him to work on his own for the vast majority of his work hours， while his new job requires almost constant interaction with coworkers， clients， his supervisor， and the general public， which does not agree with him； he describes himself as\"not a very sociable person.The patient says that hehas almost no friends， except for a cousin to whom he has been close since childhood. He reports that he has never had a significant romantic relationship or sexual encounter， but he does not miss having these experiences or having friends. He states that he most enjoys spending hours surfing the Internet， collecting stamps， or playing computer games by himself. He has never seen a mental health professional before and has presented today only at the insistence of his primary care provider.\n\n【2】On mental status examination， the patient appears notably detached and aloof toward the examiner. He exhibits little eye contact. His mood is reported as\"stressed，but his affect is not congruent with this. He appears calm， and his emotional range is flat. No other prominent symptoms are noted during the mental status examination.\n\n【3】What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【4】What is the best initial treatment?\n\n【5】ANSWERS TO CASE 48：Schizoid Personality Disorder\n\n【6】Summary： A 56-year-old man presents with\n\n【7】Restricted affect and depression\n\n【8】● Reports no complaints but gives history of isolation and limited interactions with others\n\n【9】● Difficulty in his new position at work that requires almost constant interaction with others\n\n【10】Restricted emotional range but otherwise normal results on mental status examination\n\n【11】Most likely diagnosis： Schizoid personality disorder.\n\n【12】Best initial treatment： Although long-term psychotherapy might help this patient， his condition is ego-syntonic， and thus he will probably not be motivated to undergo such treatment. The best strategy for decreasing this patient's stress is for him to seek another job with a low level of interpersonal interaction.\n\n【13】Objectives\n\n【14】1\\. Recognize schizoid personality disorder in a patient.(EPA 1，2)\n\n【15】2\\. Understand that patients with this disorder tend to do poorly in settings where a great deal of interpersonal interaction is required. (EPA 9，12)\n\n【16】Considerations\n\n【17】This patient likely has schizoid personality disorder. Recent studies estimate the prevalence of schizoid personality disorder as 1% to 7.5%， with men being diag-nosed twice as often as women. There is some minor association of psychotic dis-orders in the relatives of schizoid individuals. A personality disorder is an inflexible way of thinking about oneself or environment， causing social or occupational dif-ficulties. The patient's life， although very socially isolated， appears adequate for the patient's needs， as he has not sought any kind of psychiatric treatment. The lack of any psychotic symptoms (hallucinations or delusions) as revealed by the patient's mental status examination is also consistent. The patient's visit to the primary care provider is probably one of the few ways that such patients interact with medi-cal personnel (aside from reporting other physical complaints， as in the general population).\n\n【18】APPROACHTO：\n\n【19】ALLOPLASTIC DEFENSES： Defenses used by patients who react to stress by attempting to change the external environment， for example， by threatening or manipulating others.\n\n【20】AUTOPLASTIC DEFENSES： Defenses used by patients who react to stress by changing their internal psychological processes.\n\n【21】EGO-DYSTONIC： Describes a character deficit perceived by a patient as objec-tionable， distressing， or inconsistent to the self.\n\n【22】EGO-SYNTONIC： Describes a character deficit perceived by the patient to be acceptable， unobjectionable， and consistent to the self. The patient tends to blame others for problems that occur. Personality disorders are ego-syntonic.\n\n【23】INTELLECTUALIZATION： A defense mechanism an individual uses to deal with internal or external stressors by excessive use of abstract thinking or making generalizations， in order to control or minimize disturbing feelings. It is present as a component of brooding， in which events are continually rehashed in a distant， abstract， emotionally barren fashion.\n\n【24】PERSONALITY DISORDER： Enduring patterns of perceiving， relating to， and thinking about the environment and oneself that are inflexible， maladaptive， and cause significant impairment in social or occupational functioning. They are not caused by the direct physiologic effects of a substance or another general medical condition and are not the consequence of another mental disorder. They are pres-ent during the person's stable functioning and not only during acute stress.\n\n【25】PERSONALITY DISORDER CLUSTERS： Three categories into which these disorders are broadly classified are A， B， and C . These clusters can be remembered by the words \"mad” (cluster A disorders in which patients display odd or eccentric behavior)，“bad”(cluster B disorders in which patients exhibit dramatic or emotional behavior)，and \"sad”(cluster C disorders in which patients show anx-ious or fearful behavior).\n\n【26】PERSONALITY TRAITS： Enduring patterns of perceiving， relating to， and thinking about the environment and oneself. They are exhibited in a wide range of important social and personal contexts. Everyone has personality traits.\n\n【27】PROJECTION： A defense mechanism by which individuals deal with conflict by falsely attributing to another their own unacceptable feelings， impulses， or thoughts. By blaming others for their sentiments and actions， the focus is removed from the person doing the accusing. For example， a patient who is angry with his therapist suddenly accuses the therapist of being angry with him.\n\n| Table 48-1·CLASSIFICATION OF PERSONALITY DISORDERS  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Cluster A： “Mad\"—odd and eccentric  | Schizoid： Loner， detached，flataffect，restrictedemotions，gener-ally indifferentto interpersonalrelationshipsoutside of imme-diate family Defense： Intellectualization  | Schizotypal： Odd， eccentric， magical thinking，paranoid，notpsychoticDefense： Projec- tion， regression， fantasy  | Paranoid： Distrustful andsuspicious； con-stricted affect Defense： Projection  |  |\n| Cluster B： “Bad\" dramatic anderratic  | Histrionic： Excessively emotionalattention-seekingDefense： Reac-tion formation， reg ression  | Narcissistic： Self-important， needs admira-tion， dismissiveof the feelings ofothersDefense： Omnipotent control， denial， externalization  | Antisocial：Lacks empathy towardothers， acts out，aggressive， musthave met criteriafor conductdisorder as achild Defense： Actingout，denial， externalization  | Borderline： Impulsive， unstable relation-ships， affective instabilitv Defense： Split- ting， projection， acting out， dissociation  |\n| Cluster C： \"Sad\"—anxious and timid  | Obsessive- compulsive： Perfectionist，“control freak'hyperfocused onorderliness Defense： Reac-tion formation， undoing  | Avoidant： Hypersensitive to criticism， sociallyuncomfortable，seeks out inter-personal relation-ships but withgreat discomfortDefense： Projection，displacement  | Dependent： Submissive， clinging，needs to be taken care of. seeks others tomake decisionsfor him/her Defense： Idealization  |  |\n\n【29】SCHIZOID FANTASY： A defense mechanism whereby fantasy is used as an escape and as a means of gratification so that other people are not required for emotional fulfillment. The retreat into fantasy itself acts as a means of distancing others.\n\n【30】CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【31】Diagnosis and Clinical Presentation\n\n【32】Patients with schizoid personality disorders have a pervasive pattern of indifference to social relationships and a restricted range of emotional experience and expres-sion. They have difficulty in expressing hostility and are self-absorbed， detached daydreamers. As a rule， they are indifferent to intimate personal contact. They are often functional at work， as long as it does not require a great deal of interpersonal contact. They appear somewhat indifferent to either praise or criticism. They do 删除换行1: not have close friends and do not seek them； they do not engage in family or social situations. A helpful mnemonic is\"SIR SAFE”：\n\n【33】Solitary\n\n【34】Indifferent to praise or criticism\n\n【35】Relationships (not interested)\n\n【36】Sexual experiences (no interest)\n\n【37】Activities not enjoyed\n\n【38】Friends lacking\n\n【39】Emotionally cold and detached\n\n【40】Differential Diagnosis\n\n【41】Although patients with schizoid personality disorder may have robust fantasy lives and appear as odd， they do not evidence frank psychosis and can have successful work histories， especially if their jobs are performed in an isolated setting. Patients with schizophrenia and schizotypal personality disorder， in contrast， typically experience more difficulty functioning in a work environment or in society at large. Patients with schizotypal personality disorder often engage in quasi-delusional or magical thinking. Patients with paranoid personality disorder tend to be more ver-bally hostile and tend to project their feelings onto others. Although patients with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder and avoidant personality disorder can appear just as emotionally constricted， they experience loneliness as ego-dystonic. They also do not tend to have such a rich fantasy life. Patients with avoidant per-sonality disorder strongly wish for relationships with others but are afraid to reach out. In contrast， patients with schizoid personality disorder feel little need for relationships.\n\n【42】Treatment\n\n【43】The main treatment for this disorder is psychotherapy， although most patients will prefer no therapy. Group therapy can also be useful. Medications are not use-ful unless there are associated anxiety or depressive symptoms. Patients with schizoid personality disorder need privacy and do not like interpersonal interac-tions. The needs of such patients should be appreciated. The provider should use a low-key technical approach (not a\"warm and fuzzy\"one) when dealing with these patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 13:40:46", "endTime": "2024/09/14 13:40:57", "cost": 10.776}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:00", "update_time": "2024-09-13 21:40:57", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 21:40:46"}

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\n【7】A. Lumbar puncture\n\n【8】B. Chest x-ray\n\n【9】C. Brain CT with contrast\n\n【10】D. MRI of the brain\n\n【11】Answer: 44.2 A . Routine chest x-rays affect the clinical management in few patients with stroke, and are not recommended as routine initial workup. CT of the brain without contrast can exclude most cases of intracranial hemorrhage, tumors, or abscesses, and is the initial test of choice in the workup of suspected stroke but it can miss up to 15% of subarachnoid hemorrhages. When a subarachnoid hemorrhage is suspected but not seen on CT, a lumbar puncture is indicated for diagnosis.\n\n【12】Question: 44.3 An 82-year-old man with suspected stroke is transferred to a major medical trauma center from an outside rural hospital. Four hours have elapsed since first presentation. Which of the following should be considered in the management of this patient?\n\n【13】A. Avoidance of acetaminophen\n\n【14】B. Aggressive blood pressure management\n\n【15】C. Thrombolysis\n\n【16】D. Early mobilization\n\n【17】Answer: 44.3 D . Mobilization of stroke patients should be started when they are considered medically stable. In the setting of an acute stroke, management of high blood pressure should be cautious. Thrombolytic therapy can be beneficial in selected patients, but carries significant risks and has numerous contraindications. Fever should be treated and a workup performed to determine its etiology, as it carries an increased risk of morbidity and mortality.\n\n【18】Question: 44.4 A 65-year-old man was hospitalized due to weakness of the right arm, which was diagnosed as an ischemic stroke. Which of the following is the best step regarding prevention of future strokes in this patient?\n\n【19】A. He would likely benefit from oral anticoagulation.\n\n【20】B. If he has 60% right carotid occlusion, then he is likely to benefit from carotid endarterectomy.\n\n【21】C. Aspirin is an acceptable option for initial therapy.\n\n【22】D. LDL cholesterol should be treated with a goal of less than 130 mg/dL.\n\n【23】Answer: 44.4 C . Patients with stroke but no detected sources of embolism benefit from anti-platelet agents, not anticoagulants. Aspirin, clopidogrel, or a combination of aspirin and dipyridamole are acceptable regimens. For patients with recent TIA or ischemic stroke and ipsilateral severe (>70%) carotid artery stenosis, carotid endarterectomy is recommended. When the degree of stenosis is less than 50%, there is no indication for CEA. Patients with a history of symptomatic cerebrovascular disease should be treated to an LDL goal of less than 100 mg/dL.\n\n【24】Question: 44.5 A man is brought to the emergency room by ambulance. Coworkers at his office stated that he was acting normally until approximately 1 hour ago when he became confused and had trouble walking. One coworker thought that his right leg seemed especially weak. The vitals are: temperature 98.6°F (37°C), pulse 110 beats/min, and blood pressure 120/80 mm Hg. The patient is arousable but does not follow commands. He has a medical alert bracelet on his arm indicating that he is a diabetic and allergic to penicillin. A blood glucose taken at the bedside is 20 mg/dL. Which of the following should be your immediate next step?\n\n【25】A. Immediately give the patient glucose or glucagon.\n\n【26】B. Immediately obtain a CT scan to assess possibility for giving rtPA.\n\n【27】C. Immediately perform a lumbar puncture to assess for meningitis.\n\n【28】D. Immediately give the patient mannitol.\n\n【29】E. Immediately start cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with chest compressions.\nAnswer: 44.5 A . The patient has severe hypoglycemia and needs to be treated immediately with glucose or glucagon. If the patient does not recover with glucose or glucagon infusion, then other tests, such as a CT scan, may be warranted. But the most important first step is to treat the patient’s low blood sugar. Be aware that hypoglycemia can mimic many of the symptoms of a stroke, including focal weakness. Mannitol is used in cases of cerebral edema and not for raising blood sugar.\n\n【30】CLINICAL PEARLS\n\n【31】 Hypertension is the single most important risk factor for stroke.\n\n【32】 Although most strokes are cerebral infarcts, it is crucial to differentiate between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke because of the implications on further treatment.\n\n【33】 CT of the brain without contrast is the initial imaging test of choice in most suspected strokes.\n\n【34】 Unless a hypertensive encephalopathy, aortic dissection, acute renal failure, or pulmonary edema is present, the treatment of arterial hypertension should be cautious.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:08:45", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:09:27", "cost": 41.94}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:00", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:09:28", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:08:45"}

The blood results are all normal, including the test for glandular fever (infectious  删除换行1: mononucleosis), which was a reasonable diagnosis with these features.\n\n【28】The previous homosexual contact increases the possibility of sexually transmitted infections. \n\n【29】It is possible that travel to Vietnam and Thailand may have been associated with high-risk  删除换行1: sexual exposure. He is known to have had a negative HIV test 12 months ago. However, it is  删除换行1: quite possible that this might be an HIV seroconversion illness. In around half of those who  删除换行1: acquire the virus, this occurs within 4–6 weeks of acquisition. Although the HIV test will  删除换行1: still be negative, this can be diagnosed by finding the presence of the HIV virus or its p24  删除换行1: antigen in the blood. He should have been counselled about precautions to reduce the risk  删除换行1: of transmission of sexually transmitted diseases at the time of the HIV testing 12 months  删除换行1: before.\n\n【30】The picture might fit for secondary syphilis, which occurs 6–8 weeks after the primary lesion. \n\n【31】However, in that case the rash would often be more extensive, and the lymph nodes are not  删除换行1: usually tender. A serological test for syphilis should certainly be performed.\n\n【32】Other viral illnesses are possible. Hepatitis may present with this more general prodrome,  删除换行1: but the normal liver function tests make this much less likely.

He is afebrile and has no sick contacts or other pertinent exposures. The rash consists of nonclustering， nonblanching， raised spots > 2 mm in size spread over his buttocks and posterior surfaces of his lower extremities. The boy also complains of knee and ankle stiffness and acute abdominal pain. His vital signs are stable， and urinalysis is unremarkable. His laboratory findings are as follows：\n\n【2】Hematocrit： 35%\n\n【3】International Normalized Ratio (INR)： 1.0\n\n【4】WBC count： 7000/mm²\n\n【5】Prothrombin time： 12 sec\n\n【6】Platelet count： 200，000/mm²\n\n【7】Partial thromboplastin time： 25.2 sec\n\n【8】What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【9】Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP). In children， the combination of rash (as described above)， arthralgias， abdominal pain， and renal disease is pathognomonic for HSP. However， only 63% of patients with HSP actually present with abdominal pain and only 40% with renal disease. An additional 33% of patients also have evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Less common symptoms include testicular torsion， intussusception， pancreatitis， cholecystitis， and protein-losing enteropathy. Approximately 1% of children with HSP progress to end-stage renal disease， and approximately 10% of HSP cases are seen in adults.\n\n【10】What are the dermatologic findings for this condition?\n\n【11】Both purpura and petechiae may be seen in HSP. Purpura is characterized by nonblanching， flat lesions measuring > 2 mm in diameter. Petechiae are non-blanching， flat lesions measuring < 2 mm in diameter. Both are signs of bleeding occurring in the skin.\n\n【12】What is the pathophysiology of this condition?\n\n【13】HSP is a small-vessel vasculitis. Although the precipitating factor is unknown， anecdotal evidence suggests upper respiratory infection for children. With HSP， IgA deposition in blood vessels causes leaking， which leads to purpura and petechiae. This is pathophysiologically similar to IgA nephropathy.\n\n【14】Which conditions should be considered in the differential diagnosis of this patient's rash? The main concerns， in addition to HSP， are clotting disorders and sepsis； as a result， coagulation studies should be performed. A similar rash can be caused by rickettsial infections， although this patient is afebrile. It is important to distinguish HSP from hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS)， as the two conditions present similarly and can both cause extensive renal disease. However， HUS is not likely in this patient， as there are no signs of hemolytic anemia such as schistocytes on blood smear. In adults， HSP must be distinguished from systemic diseases such as hypersensitivity vasculitis and systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\n【15】What are the appropriate treatments for this condition?\n\n【16】Treatment is based on the severity of symptoms， as the disease is typically self-limiting. An asymptomatic patient requires no treatment. However， severe symptoms， including signs of renal involvement， may require renal biopsy and steroids. Regardless of the severity of symptoms， patients with HSP require urinalysis every 3 months for 1 year， as HSP has a high rate of recurrence.

However， there is evidence of a paranoid delusion (believing there are cameras in the doctor’s office recording her) that persists without mood symptoms. Although the patient was not asked about manic symptoms， the presence of such symptoms is a crucial element in the patient’s history because it changes the subtype of schizoaffective disorder from depressive type to bipolar type and， in turn， affects the pharmaco-logic treatment choices. Without these symptoms， the patient's disorder would be characterized as depressive type.\n\n【18】APPROACHTO：\n\n【19】Schizoaffective Disorder\n\n【20】DEFINITIONS\n\n【21】ANERGIA： Lack of energy.\n\n【22】ANHEDONIA： Lack of interest in one's usual pleasure-seeking activities， such as hobbies.\n\n【23】TANGENTIAL SPEECH (TANGENTIALITY)： A disorder of thought process in which one's thoughts\"take off on a tangent\"from the initial question or line of thought and do not return to the original line of thinking.\n\n【24】CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【25】Pathophysiology\n\n【26】The key to the diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder is that a patient has at least2 weeks of psychotic episodes without mood symptoms and also episodes of mood symptoms without psychosis. See Table 5-1、\n\n【27】Studies have also shown brain matter abnormalities in patients with schizophre-nia and schizoaffective disorder. One study confirmed， through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)， the presence of white matter pathology early in the course of these illnesses. These data support the hypotheses of frontotemporal dysfunction and abnormalities in left-hemisphere lateralization in the pathophysiology of these ill-nesses. Some studies have demonstrated a more substantial degree of general psycho-pathology in younger patients with schizoaffective disorder as compared to adults.\n\n【28】Differential Diagnosis\n\n【29】The key to developing a differential diagnosis for schizoaffective disorder is to care-fully examine the longitudinal functioning of patients by reviewing their histories(provided by the patients and ideally by significant others). Periods of psychosis， as well as periods of psychosis with mood symptoms (mania and/or depression)， must be carefully teased out over a time period of years， if possible. Conditions caus-ing substance-induced mood disorder (which can be difficult to differentiate from schizoaffective disorder) include cocaine， methamphetamine， K2/Spice (a synthetic cannabinoid)， bath salts or amphetamine intoxication (manic symptoms)， cocaine\n\n| Table 5-1·DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR SCHIZOAFFECTIVE DISORDER  |\n| --- |\n| Patients must exhibit psychotic symptoms consistent with the acute phase of schizophrenia.Psychotic symptoms must be accompanied by prominent mood symptoms (mania or depression)during part of the illness. At other points in the illness， the psychotic symptoms must be unopposed； that is， no moodsymptoms are present. Periods of illness in which there are only psychotic symptoms， and nomood symptoms， must last for at least 2 weeks. The disorder cannot be caused by a substance or by another medical condition.  |\n\n【31】withdrawal (depressive symptoms)，and the effects of a host of prescribed medications including steroids and antiparkinsonian medications. The symptoms of schizophrenia can appear similar， but the mood symptoms sometimes present in that disorder are generally transient and are brief in relation to the total length of the illness. Patients with bipolar disorder generally have mood symptoms (eg， euphoria， irritability) pre-dating development of the psychoses， as have patients with major depression with psychotic features (a depressed mood predating the onset of psychosis).\n\n【32】Ireatment\n\n【33】Antipsycbotic Agents. Patients with schizoaffective disorder generally respond to antipsychotic agents and often require long-term therapy. Although haloperidol(Haldol) and typical antipsychotics were once the treatments of choice (indeed， the only options available)， newer atypical (second-generation) antipsychotics are now used far more frequently because of their more benign， short-term side-effect profile. These medications are not known to cause tardive dyskinesia， most extrapyra-midal symptoms， or neuroleptic malignant syndrome. They are likely well tolerated because they also produce fewer anticholinergic side effects.\n\n【34】Second generation antipsychotics do， however， have significant long-term side effects that must be monitored. These include weight gain， insulin resistance， and hyperlipidemia. There is little good evidence that second-generation antipsychot-ics are better than first generation in terms of efficacy. Both typical and atypical antipsychotic medications have approximately the same duration of action， making once or twice per day dosing feasible in both cases.\n\n【35】Mood Stabilizers. Mood stabilizers such as lithium， carbamazepine， and valproic acid should be administered to patients with schizoaffective disorder who exhibit manic symptoms (bipolar type of schizoaffective disorder). It is sometimes helpful 1 to combine an antidepressant and an antipsychotic for patients with schizoaffective disorder with a depressed mood. However， such patients should be treated with an antidepressant in addition to their antipsychotic only if the antipsychotic alone does not ameliorate the mood symptoms.\n\n【36】Other Treatments. Other treatment modalities can include hospitalization， par-ticularly when patients are psychotic and unable to care for themselves or suicidal. Psychosocial rehabilitation， such as is used in the treatment of schizophrenia， is often indicated as well because these patients can suffer from the same social iso-lation， apathy， and disturbed interpersonal relationships that schizophrenics do， although usually not with the same degree of severity.\n\n【37】Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has more recently shown some utility in the management of psychotic symptoms in both schizophrenic and schizoaffec-tive patients. However， this treatment is still considered experimental and is not yet frequently used. ECT， however， has proven efficacy in treating both the depression and the psychosis for people with schizoaffective disorder who are not responding or suboptimally responding to oral therapies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "A A diagnosis of major depression with a recent suicide attempt\n\n【6】Seemingly good response to treatment for major depression\n\n【7】Evidence of paranoia still present after mood symptoms have resolved\n\n【8】Most likely diagnosis： Schizoaffective disorder.", "content": "【0】Case 5\nA 15-year-old adolescent girl is brought to your office by her family after a recent hospitalization for a suicide attempt.

The symptoms of schizophrenia can appear similar， but the mood symptoms sometimes present in that disorder are generally transient and are brief in relation to the total length of the illness.

Patients with schizoaffective disorder generally respond to antipsychotic agents and often require long-term therapy. Although haloperidol(Haldol) and typical antipsychotics were once the treatments of choice (indeed， the only options available)， newer atypical (second-generation) antipsychotics are now used far more frequently because of their more benign， short-term side-effect profile. These medications are not known to cause tardive dyskinesia， most extrapyra-midal symptoms， or neuroleptic malignant syndrome. They are likely well tolerated because they also produce fewer anticholinergic side effects.\n\n【34】Second generation antipsychotics do， however， have significant long-term side effects that must be monitored. These include weight gain， insulin resistance， and hyperlipidemia. There is little good evidence that second-generation antipsychot-ics are better than first generation in terms of efficacy. Both typical and atypical antipsychotic medications have approximately the same duration of action， making once or twice per day dosing feasible in both cases.\n\n【35】Mood Stabilizers. Mood stabilizers such as lithium， carbamazepine， and valproic acid should be administered to patients with schizoaffective disorder who exhibit manic symptoms (bipolar type of schizoaffective disorder). It is sometimes helpful 1 to combine an antidepressant and an antipsychotic for patients with schizoaffective disorder with a depressed mood.

Other treatment modalities can include hospitalization， par-ticularly when patients are psychotic and unable to care for themselves or suicidal. Psychosocial rehabilitation， such as is used in the treatment of schizophrenia， is often indicated as well because these patients can suffer from the same social iso-lation， apathy， and disturbed interpersonal relationships that schizophrenics do， although usually not with the same degree of severity.\n\n【37】Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has more recently shown some utility in the management of psychotic symptoms in both schizophrenic and schizoaffec-tive patients.

Each case was successfully treated acutely; however, your patient is interested in trying to prevent future episodes. He is not on regular medications and has a normal physical examination today. Blood work reveals an elevated serum uric acid level and otherwise normal renal function and electrolytes. A 24-hour urine collection for uric acid reveals that he is underexcreting uric acid. Suspecting that this is the cause of his recurrent gout, you place him on probenecid.\n\n【2】 What is the mechanism of action of probenecid?\n\n【3】 Which drugs could have their excretion inhibited by probenecid?\n\n【4】ANSWERS TO CASE 8:\n\n【5】Nondiuretic Inhibitors of Tubular Transport\n\n【6】Summary: A 50-year-old man with recurrent gout is prescribed probenecid.\n\n【7】 Mechanism of action of probenecid: Inhibits secretion of organic acids and decreases reabsorption of uric acid, causing a net increase in secretion.\n\n【8】 Other drugs whose secretion could be inhibited: Penicillin, indomethacin, and methotrexate.\n\n【9】#### CLINICAL CORRELATION\n\n【10】Gout is a disease in which uric acid crystals deposit in joints, causing an extremely painful acute inflammatory arthritis. Persons with recurrent gout often have chronically elevated levels of uric acid in their blood. This hyperuricemia is frequently caused by either overproduction of uric acid or underexcretion of uric acid by the kidneys. Probenecid (and other uricosuric drugs) promotes the excretion of uric acid. It works by inhibiting the secretion of organic acids from the plasma into the tubular lumen and blocking the reuptake of uric acid. The net result of this is an increase in the excretion of uric acid. The benefit of this is the prevention of recurrent gout attacks in chronic underexcreters of uric acid. In those individuals who overproduce uric acid, allopurinol or febuxostat is used. These drugs inhibit xanthine oxidase, a key enzyme in the production of uric acid. For patients with severe gout refractory to the above drugs, IV infusion of pegloticase can quickly reduce serum urate and reduce deposits in joints.\n\n【11】APPROACH TO:\n\n【12】Pharmacology of Uricosuric Agents\n\n【13】#### OBJECTIVES\n\n【14】1\\. Understand the mechanism of action of uricosuric agents.\n\n【15】2\\. Know the therapeutic uses, adverse effects, and contraindications to uricosurics.\n\n【16】3\\. Know the mechanism of action and use of allopurinol.\n\n【17】#### DEFINITIONS\n\n【18】Uricosuric agents: Increase the mass of uric acid that is excreted in the urine.\n\n【19】Renal secretion: Moves solutes such as urate from the plasma into the urine.\n\n【20】Renal reabsorption: Moves solutes from the urine back into the plasma.\n\n【21】#### DISCUSSION\n\n【22】##### Class\n\n【23】Urate is both secreted and reabsorbed by several independent molecular transporters located in the proximal tubule. Urate is nearly completely secreted into the lumen of the nephron against an electrochemical gradient by the action of organic acid transporter-1 (OAT-1) and organic acid transporter-3 (OAT-3). These cotransporters exchange α-ketoglutarate and urate (or other organic anions) and move urate from the plasma into the tubular cell. The protein UAT is an electrically neutral channel that permits uric acid to leave tubular cells and enter either the tubular lumen or the plasma. URAT1, located on the apical membrane of tubular cells, is thought to be responsible for most of the reabsorption of urate from the filtrate. URAT1 is a transporter that is capable of exchanging a variety of anions with urate in an electrically neutral manner. Interaction of uricosuric agents such as probenecid with URAT1 diminishes the reabsorption of urate and increases urate excretion. All of these transporters or channels are relatively nonselective with respect to the organic acid transported. OAT-1 and OAT-3 are capable of secreting most organic acids including probenecid, penicillin, aspirin, furosemide, and hydrochlorothiazide.\n\n【24】In patients with gout, probenecid can be used prophylactically; uricosuric drugs will not diminish the severity of an acute attack. An acute gouty attack may be precipitated by the initiation of probenecid treatment as uric acid is mobilized out of joints. Adequate hydration should be ensured, because probenecid predisposes patients to the formation of uric acid kidney stones.\n\n【25】Probenecid is also useful for decreasing the excretion of penicillin, because penicillin is eliminated primarily by renal secretion mediated by OAT-1 and OAT-3. Probenecid competes for this secretion and thereby reduces the rate of elimination and increases both the biological half-life of penicillin and the plasma concentration of the antibiotic more than twofold. This adjunct use of probenecid is particularly useful in single-dose regimens for the treatment of gonococcal infections with long-acting penicillins such as penicillin G.\n\n【26】Secretion of organic acids is quite nonspecific, and most acidic drugs are secreted by the same transporters OAT-1 and OAT-3. This implies that nearly any combination of acidic drugs will compete for elimination at the level of the transporters, and the effects on elimination of each individual drug must be considered. For example, the half-life of diuretics such as furosemide will be increased by probenecid, and this may require dosage adjustment. Aspirin, another acidic drug, will compete with probenecid for secretion. This reduces the action of probenecid to increase uric acid excretion and thus increases plasma urate. Therefore, aspirin is contraindicated in patients with gout who are taking probenecid.\n\n【27】The most common adverse effect of probenecid is gastrointestinal (GI) upset, and approximately 2 percent of patients experience a hypersensitivity reaction usually manifest as a skin rash. The incidence of hypersensitivity is lower with sulfinpyrazone, but the incidence of GI upset is higher.\n\n【28】The alternate therapeutic approach to the treatment of gout is to reduce the production of uric acid with an inhibitor of the enzyme xanthine oxidase. This enzyme produces uric acid in a two-step reaction from the purine hypoxanthine. Allopurinol and febuxostat are drugs used to inhibit xanthine oxidase. Allopurinol is metabolized to alloxanthine by xanthine oxidase, and this metabolite is a long-lasting inhibitor of the enzyme. Febuxostat is a more specific inhibitor of xanthine oxidase than allopurinol.\n\n【29】Uric acid accumulates in humans because we lack the enzyme uricase, which converts urate to the water-soluble allantoin. Recombinant uricase is available as pegloticase, which is administered by infusion. Pegloticase is used in severe refractory gout.\n\n【30】##### Structure\n\n【31】Probenecid is a lipid-soluble benzoic acid derivative with a pKa of 3.4. Another agent in this class is s ulfinpyrazone, a pyrazolone derivative similar to the anti-inflammatory agent phenylbutazone. It has a pKa of 2.8 but is no longer marketed in the United States.\n\n【32】##### Mechanism of Action\n\n【33】Both probenecid and sulfinpyrazone are secreted into the lumen of the nephron via OAT-1 and OAT-3 where the drugs can diminish the ability of URAT1 to reabsorb urate.\n\n【34】##### Administration\n\n【35】Both drugs are active orally, and both are nearly completely absorbed.\n\n【36】##### Pharmacokinetics\n\n【37】The half-life of probenecid is 5–8 hours; sulfinpyrazone is approximately 3 hours, but its uricosuric actions can last as long as 10 hours. Increased excretion of uric acid occurs promptly after oral administration. Both agents are eliminated in the urine.\n\n【38】####", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:44:17", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:44:36", "cost": 18.97}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:00", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:44:35", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:44:16"}

Which the following would be consistent with this patient’s likely diagnosis?\n\n【1】> (A) Bilateral underdevelopment of the iris\n\n【2】> (B) Elevated urine free cortisol\n\n【3】> (C) Elevated urine vanillylmandelic acid\n\n【4】> (D) Symptoms of hypotensive shock\n\n【5】> (E) WBC count >60,000/mm <sup class=\"calibre40\">3</sup>\n\n【6】 Answer: The correct answer is C . Neuroblastoma is a tumor that often affects the adrenal medulla, although it can involve any site along the sympathetic chain. It is most commonly seen in children, with a median age of presentation of 17 months. The condition may present with constitutional symptoms as well as periorbital ecchymosis, proptosis, limp, bone pain, hypertension, and/or involvement of the skin (bluish, nontender subcutaneous nodules). Urine vanillylmandelic acid and homomandelic acid levels are typically elevated in these patients. Therapy involves resection, radiation, and/or chemotherapy.  \n\n【7】Answer A is incorrect . Bilateral underdevelopment of the iris, also known as aniridia, would be consistent with symptoms of WAGR, in which the W stands for Wilms tumor ( WAGR means W ilms tumor, A niridia, G enitourinary malformations, and mental R etardation). Wilms tumor is the most common primary renal tumor, commonly presenting with an asymptomatic flank mass that classically does not cross the midline, while this patient’s mass does cross the midline on physical examination. Mean age at presentation is 42 months.  \n\n【8】Answer B is incorrect . Adrenal adenocarcinoma may cause Cushing syndrome, resulting in findings such as truncal obesity, moon facies, buffalo hump, purple striae, muscle wasting, osteoporosis, and psychiatric disturbances. However, this patient’s age and symptoms are far more consistent with neuroblastoma.  \n\n【9】Answer D is incorrect . Symptoms of hypotensive shock without hypovolemia in this young child would be consistent with adrenal insufficiency due to adrenocortical atrophy. Other symptoms may include nausea and vomiting, which this patient does not have. Adrenocortical atrophy would not present with a mass on physical examination or imaging.  \n\n【10】Answer E is incorrect . A WBC count >60,000/mm <sup class=\"calibre40\">3 </sup> in this patient would be consistent with an acute leukemia. However, while acute leukemias can present with systemic symptoms, they do not involve the presence of abdominal masses.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 13:32:50", "endTime": "2024/09/14 13:36:27", "cost": 216.272}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:00", "update_time": "2024-09-13 21:36:26", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 21:32:49"}

A bacterial propyl endopeptidase could potentially catalyze the breakdown ofthis peptide， thereby pre-venting it from interacting with TTG. Removing the 33-mer and its antigenic epitopes from the subepithelial space would eliminate the interaction of HLA DQ2-bound peptides with T cells and would halt the inflammatory process.\n\n【6】Answer 2\n\n【7】Testing is recommended in asymptomatic children who are in high-risk groups (type l diabetes mellitus， autoimmune thyroiditis， Down syndrome， Turner syndrome， Williams syndrome， IgA deficiency， and first-degree relatives of patients with celiac disease) starting at age 3 years， as long as they have not been put on a gluten-free diet. The reasoning behind testing asymptomatic children is that celiac disease can be clinically difficult to detect-but there is reason to believe that ongoing inflamma-tion in the gut has deleterious effects and so it should be diagnosed and treated as early as possible.\n\n【8】An initial negative screen for celiac disease does not preclude its emergence later in some people. Repeat screening for type l diabetics and patients with Down syn-drome and first-degree relatives with celiac disease should be performed periodi-cally. The optimal frequency of such testing has not yet been clarified. An alternative to interval testing is to HLA type the high-risk individuals. In the absence ofHLA DQ2or DQ8， celiac disease is extremely rare.\n\n【9】Answer 3\n\n【10】A level of 220 p.p.m. gluten had been arbitrarily designated as gluten free， but there is emerging evidence that even very small amounts of gluten are toxic to people with celiac disease and a new limit of 20 p.p.m. is being considered. The amount of gluten in foods is not the only challenge to patients； unclear labeling also poses a major obstacle to maintaining a gluten-free diet.\n\n【11】Answer 4\n\n【12】Oats do not contain gluten， but they can be cross-contaminated with wheat as a result of storage in silos that hold both types of grains. Patients newly diagnosed with celiac disease should not eat oats， but the grain can be reintroduced in small amounts once the disease is in remission.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:31:00", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:31:34", "cost": 33.624}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:00", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:31:33", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:30:59"}

This patient is suffering from a severe metabolic acidosis, as indicated by low serum pH, a low plasma bicarbonate level, and compensatory hyperventilation manifested as tachypnea. Next, note that the anion gap is elevated at 20 mmol/L (normal: 3-11 mmol/L). Of the choices, only iron toxicity (the I in the mnemonic MUDPILES ) is associated with elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis.  \n\n【13】Answer A is incorrect . Aldosterone normally functions to increase sodium reabsorption, potassium excretion, and proton excretion in the distal nephron. Thus, aldosterone antagonists cause diminished proton excretion and metabolic acidosis. However, unlike this case, the acidosis would be expected to occur in the setting of a normal anion gap.  \n\n【14】Answer B is incorrect . Most simple antacids are alkaline and operate by neutralizing the low pH of the stomach. Thus, overdose would be expected to cause a metabolic alkalosis, not an acidosis.  \n\n【15】Answer D is incorrect . Loop diuretic toxicity is associated with metabolic alkalosis, not acidosis.  \n\n【16】Answer E is incorrect . Ingestion of opiates results in reduced respiratory drive and subsequent hypoventilation.

The patient is deficient in Cq-antitrypsin， with activity approximately 15% of normal values； concentrations of40% or more are required for health. The patient is homozygous for the gene (Z) encoding a protease inhibitor (Pi). Other genetic combinations and their percentage normal activity are MS (80%)， MZ (60%)， SS (60%)， SZ (40%). Six per cent of the population is heterozygous for S(PiMS) and 4% for Z(PiMZ)， making an overall frequency of 1 in 10 for the carriage of the defective gene. Liver transplantation results in conver-sion to the genotype of the donor.\n\n【52】●In the lung C-antitrypsin inhibits the excessive actions of neutrophil and macrophage elastase， which cigarette smoke promotes. When the lung is heavily exposed to cigarette smoke， the protective effect of C-antitrypsin may be overwhelmed by the amount of elastase released or by a direct oxidative action of cigarette smoke on the c-antitrypsin molecule. The emphysema is panacinar and is seen in the lower lobes 删除换行1: of the lungs. Smoking increases the severity of， and decreases the age of onset of， emphysema. Liver disease is a much less common complica-tion. Human C-antitrypsin prepared from pooled plasma from normal donors is recommended for patients over 18 years with serum levels below 11 pmol/l and abnormal lung function.\n\n【53】The siblings of an index case should be screened for this disorder. Their identification should be followed by counselling to avoid smoking and occupations with atmospheric pollution.

Charcot arthropathy results in progressive  删除换行1: destruction of bone and soft tissues at weight-bearing joints. In its most severe form it  删除换行1: may cause significant disruption of the bony architecture, including joint dislocations  删除换行1: and fractures. Charcot arthropathy can occur at any joint but most commonly affects the  删除换行1: lower regions: the foot and ankle. Bilateral disease occurs in fewer than 10 per cent of  删除换行1: patients.\n\n【14】Any condition that leads to a sensory or autonomic neuropathy can cause a Charcot  删除换行1: joint. Charcot arthropathy can occur as a complication of diabetes, syphilis, alcohol删除8：<u>￾</u>ism, leprosy, meningomyleocele, spinal cord injury, syringomyelia, renal dialysis and  删除换行1: congenital insensitivity to pain.\n\n【15】In the majority of cases, non-operative methods are preferred. The principles of manage删除8：<u>￾</u>ment are to provide immobilization of the affected joint and reduce any areas of stress  删除换行1: on the skin. Immobilization is usually accomplished by casting. Total-contact casts have  删除换行1: been shown to allow patients to ambulate while preventing the progression of deformity. \n\n【16】Casts must be checked weekly, and they should be replaced every 1–2 weeks. Patients  删除换行1: with concomitant ulceration must have their casts changed weekly for ulcer evaluation  删除换行1: and debridement. Serial plain radiographs should be taken approximately every month  删除换行1: during the acute phase. Casting is usually necessary for 3–6 months and is discontinued  删除换行1: based on clinical and radiographic assessments, and dermal temperature and signs of  删除换行1: quiescence.\n\n【17】Surgery is uncommonly indicated for a Charcot foot when non-surgical methods fail:  删除换行1: in particular when the deformity places the foot at risk of ulceration or when the foot  删除换行1: can no longer be protected in accommodative footwear. The aim of surgery is to achieve  删除换行1: a stable foot and ankle joint, maintaining the plantigrade position. The foot should be  删除换行1: able to tolerate accommodative footwear and support ambulation of the patient. A major  删除换行1: contraindication to surgery is active inflammation.\n\n【18】KEY POINTS\n\n【19】• Charcot arthropathy results in progressive destruction of bone and soft tissues at  删除换行1: weight-bearing joints.\n\n【20】• Non-operative methods are the treatment of choice.\n\n【21】• The aim of surgery is to achieve a stable foot and ankle joint, maintaining the  删除换行1: plantigrade position.删除个例：<u>Orthopaedics</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:42:40", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:42:47", "cost": 6.819}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:00", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:42:47", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:42:40"}

Usually, in the former, there is evidence of either a systemic  删除换行1: illness or some other obvious precipitating cause (e.g. use of nephrotoxic drugs/prolonged  删除换行1: episode of hypotension), whereas in the latter there is a prolonged history of general malaise. \n\n【32】If the patient has had previous blood tests measuring serum creatinine, these will be infor删除8：<u>￾</u>mative about the progression of deterioration of renal function. In this patient, the anaemia  删除换行1: and hyperparathyroidism (raised alkaline phosphatase) are features indicating chronic删除8：<u>￾</u>ity of the renal failure. The normochromic, normocytic anaemia is predominantly due to  删除换行1: erythropoietin deficiency (the kidney is the major source of erythropoietin production). \n\n【33】Hyperparathyroidism is a result of elevated serum phosphate levels due to decreased renal  删除换行1: clearance of phosphate and reduced vitamin D levels (the kidney is the site of hydroxylation  删除换行1: of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol to the active form 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol). A hand X-ray  删除换行1: showing the typical appearances of hyperparathyroidism (erosion of the terminal phalanges  删除换行1: and subperiosteal erosions of the radial aspects of the middle phalanges) can help to confirm  删除换行1: long-standing renal failure.\n\n【34】Renal ultrasound is the essential investigation. Ultrasound will accurately size the kid删除8：<u>￾</u>neys and identify obvious causes for renal failure, such as polycystic kidney disease or  删除换行1: obstruction causing bilateral hydronephrosis. Asymmetrically sized kidneys suggest reflux  删除换行1: nephropathy or renovascular disease. In this case, ultrasound showed two small (8 cm)  删除换行1: echogenic kidneys consistent with long-standing renal failure. A renal biopsy in this case  删除换行1: is not appropriate as biopsies of small kidneys have a high incidence of bleeding compli删除8：<u>￾</u>cations, and the sample obtained would show extensive glomerular and tubulointerstitial  删除换行1: fibrosis and may not identify the original disease. The patient’s renal failure may have been  删除换行1: due to hypertension or a primary glomerulonephritis such as immunoglobulin A (IgA)  删除换行1: nephropathy. African-Caribbeans are more prone to develop hypertensive renal failure  删除换行1: than other racial groups.\n\n【35】Antihypertensive medications are needed to treat her blood pressure adequately, oral phos删除8：<u>￾</u>phate binders and vitamin D preparations to control her secondary hyperparathyroidism,  删除换行1: and erythropoietin injections to treat her anaemia. The case raises the dilemma of whether  删除换行1: dialysis is appropriate in this patient. Hospital-based haemodialysis and home-based perito删除8：<u>￾</u>neal dialysis are the options available. Her age and comorbid illnesses preclude renal trans删除8：<u>￾</u>plantation.

He has been experiencing headaches over the past 6 months but no other associated symptoms. His mother states she has witnessed him to have two previous seizures. The history is notable for being sexually promiscuous and using intravenous illicit drugs. The result of his last HIV test is unknown. On neurologic examination he is noted to have increased tone on the right and decreased right arm swing when walking. The remainder of his neurologic examination is normal. A CT scan of the head with contrast reveals that he has a ring-enhancing lesion measuring 15 mm over the left motor strip region and a 12-mm ring-enhancing lesion in the left basal ganglia.\n\n【8】• Most likely diagnosis: Cerebral toxoplasmosis.\n\n【9】• Tests to confirm diagnosis: Serum IgM and IgG titers for Toxoplasmosis gondii , and lumbar puncture to evaluate for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) T gondii .\n\n【10】• Treatment plan: Start anticonvulsants to prevent further seizures and then start treatment for toxoplasmosis. Therapy consists of a combination of medications including pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, and folinic acid.\n\n【11】#### ANALYSIS\n\n【12】##### Objectives\n\n【13】1\\. Know a diagnostic approach to toxoplasmosis including the use of imaging studies and cerebrospinal fluid studies.\n\n【14】2\\. Describe the clinical features of toxoplasmosis.\n\n【15】3\\. Describe how to treat toxoplasmosis and what precautions are necessary.\n\n【16】##### Considerations\n\n【17】This 25-year-old healthy man has been experiencing headaches for the past 6 months and just experienced his third generalized tonic–clonic seizure. His examination suggests a left-sided brain lesion as he has right-sided motor findings (decreased right arm swing and increased tone on the right). The fact that he seems to have constitutional symptoms of weight loss and has risk factors for an HIV infection narrows the differential diagnosis significantly. This individual is most likely now HIV positive. This is based on the fact that he has been experiencing weight loss and has continued to participate in behavior placing him at high risk for HIV infection. Primary CNS lymphoma, syphilitic gummas, tuberculomas, abscesses, neurocysticercosis, or metastatic brain tumors should be considered in the differential diagnosis. The presentation of headache, weight loss, generalized tonic–clonic seizures, and a focal neurologic examination suggests an intracranial lesion. An individual that is young and HIV positive should be considered to have toxoplasmosis, primary CNS lymphoma, syphilitic gummas, tuberculomas, or brain abscesses. A CT scan of the head with and without contrast usually confirms the clinical suspicion but cannot differentiate each entity. Serologic studies in addition to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies will help best determine the diagnosis. Besides the diagnostic tests described above, other CSF studies include protein, glucose, cell count with differential, Gram stain, cytology, Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL). Other serological studies include chemistry 20, CBC, HIV, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), rapid plasma reagin (RPR), international normalized ratio (INR).\n\n【18】### APPROACH TO: Infections in Immunocompromised Hosts: Toxoplasmosis\n\n【19】#### DEFINITIONS\n\n【20】GENERALIZED TONIC–CLONIC SEIZURE: It is often referred to as a grand mal seizure and involves loss of consciousness, violent muscle contractions, and rigidity.\n\n【21】FOLINIC ACID: The reduced form of folic acid that does not require reduction reaction by enzyme for activation.\n\n【22】RADICULOMYELOPATHY: A process affecting the nerve root and spinal cord.\n\n【23】RING-ENHANCING LESION: A lesion that shows peripheral enhancement with central hypodensity after being administered contrast. This is in contrast to a disk enhancement lesion where there is uniform enhancement with contrast.\n\n【24】#### CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【25】Toxoplasmosis is caused by the single-celled parasite, T gondii , which is found throughout the world. It was discovered in 1908 in the gondi , a small rat-like animal from North Africa, and causes CNS toxoplasmosis in immunocompromised hosts. Toxoplasmosis has multiple hosts including humans, cats , and other warmblooded animals. Toxoplasmosis is a common opportunistic infection in the HIV population . In fact, it is the leading cause of focal central nervous system disease in AIDS and is most frequently seen during the later phases of the disease. It is a fairly common infection with approximately 33% of all humans having come in contact with this parasite during their lifetime. In immunocompetent adults, exposure to toxoplasmosis is asymptomatic; however, in immunocompromised patients it can lead to severe disease and death. Toxoplasmosis acquired in pregnancy can cause various congenital anomalies in the fetus including hydrocephalus, intracerebral calcification, retardation, chorioretinitis, hearing loss, and even death.\n\n【26】Toxoplasmosis is frequently seen in advanced AIDS when the CD4+ counts are <200 cells/mm <sup class=\"calibre11\">3 </sup> . Up to 5% of patients initially diagnosed with AIDS in the United States will present with toxoplasmosis. Fortunately, the incidence of toxoplasmosis has significantly declined since the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). In Africa and Europe, as many as 50% of patients with AIDS will develop CNS toxoplasmosis.\n\n【27】#### TRANSMISSION\n\n【28】There are three primary ways of transmission: by ingesting uncooked meat containing tissue cysts, by ingesting food and water contaminated with oocysts from infected cat feces, and by vertical transmission. The parasite can also be transmitted by transplantation of organs and blood transfusions. Although CNS toxoplasmosis occasionally results from a primary infection, it is more commonly caused by hematogenous spread of a previous infection.\n\n【29】##### Clinical Presentation and Diagnosis\n\n【30】The most common clinical presentation in HIV-infected patients is encephalitis as a result of multiple brain lesions . Usually, the patient experiences deterioration in mentation over days to weeks, including headaches, seizures, or cognitive impairment; motor or sensory deficits can also be seen. T gondii can also affect other organs such as the eyes or lungs.\n删除4：<u>Table 31–1 • CLINICAL FEATURES OF INTRACRANIAL TOXOPLASMOSIS</u>\n\n【31】Diagnostic studies used to help diagnose CNS toxoplasmosis include T gondii IgG and IgM titers. An IgM antibody response is associated with newly acquired toxoplasmosis. However, antibody levels can be very low in AIDS patients . It has been reported that up to 22% of patients diagnosed with toxoplasmosis by histologic confirmation had absent antibody levels. If there are no signs of increased intracranial pressure, then a lumbar puncture may be obtained. Cerebrospinal fluid studies consistently show an elevated protein level. There is a great degree of variability when it comes to other CSF studies. PCR for T gondii in the CSF has moderate sensitivity and high specificity.\n\n【32】The typical findings on CT scan or MRI of the brain are single or multiple hypodense lesions in the white matter and occasionally in the basal ganglia with mass effect. Lesions are usually ring enhancing . Typically, patients will present with multiple rather than solitary lesions . In fact, a solitary lesion favors CNS lymphoma over toxoplasmosis.\n\n【33】删除3：<u>Figure 31–1 . CT brain image with ring-enhancing toxoplasmosis. ( Reproduced, with permission, from Roos KL . Principles of Neurologic Infectious Diseases. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Publishers, 2005:80 .)</u>\n\n【34】Brain biopsy, revealing the organism, should only be performed if there is no response to empiric treatment within 2 weeks or if there is a solitary lesion and negative serological studies. Microscopic examination is notable for lymphocytic vasculitis, microglial nodules, and astroglial nodules. Cases that show marked increased intracranial pressure and herniation are best handled with the aid of neurosurgeons.\n\n【35】#### TREATMENT\n\n【36】The main treatment for CNS toxoplasmosis consists of pyrimethamine at a dose of 100 mg orally twice a day on the first day followed by 25 mg to 100 mg per day. Due to its selective activity against dihydrofolate reductase, it is imperative that folic acid be given concomitantly. This is often in the form of folinic acid. Sulfadiazine, which acts synergistically with pyrimethamine, should be given concomitantly at a dose of 1 g to 2 g orally four times a day. If there is significant cerebral edema, corticosteroids such as dexamethasone (Decadron) should be given. Almost 75% of patients will improve within 1 week of receiving antibiotic therapy. The prognosis for full recovery is guarded as there may be frequent relapses. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole has also been studied as an alternative first-line agent in the treatment of CNS toxoplasmosis given it is inexpensive and well tolerated.\n\n【37】##### Prophylaxis\n\n【38】Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is an effective prophylaxis against T gondii , and indicated for HIV-infected individuals with CD4 counts less than 200 cells/mm <sup class=\"calibre11\">3 </sup> . Precautions include cooking meats completely, hygiene when handling uncooked or undercooked meat, and avoiding exposure to cat feces, such as cleaning litter boxes.\n\n【39】####", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:45:24", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:46:19", "cost": 54.281}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:00", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:46:16", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:45:22"}

There are no data suggesting that the condition was produced intentionally or is being feigned. It is possible(based on her history of domestic violence) that the accident triggered memories of the psychological trauma she experienced and this has a role in the severity of her current pain.

All the disor-ders share a common feature： the predominance of somatic symptoms associated with significant stress and impairment.\n\n【27】CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【28】Diagnosis and Clinical Presentation\n\n【29】Somatic symptom disorder with predominant pain is diagnosed in individuals whose somatic complaints involve pain. Pain is a very common complaint in medi-cine and occurs more often in older patients (fourth and fifth decades of life) and in those who are likely to have job-related physical injuries. Chronic back pain， headaches， or dyspareunia are common manifestations. A number of psychody-namic factors can be involved， including inability to express emotions verbally， an unconscious need to obtain attention by suffering physical pain， or an unconscious need for punishment. Individuals also learn this form of help-seeking in a family that models and reinforces the behavior. Table 29-1 lists the diagnostic criteria for somatic symptom disorder with predominant pain.\n\n| Table 29-1·DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR SOMATIC SYMPTOM DISORDERWITH PREDOMINANTPAIN  |\n| --- |\n| One or more somatic symptoms that are distressing or result in significant disruption of daily life.aExcessive thoughts， feelings， or behaviors related to the somatic symptoms or associated healthconcerns as manifested by at least one of the following： ·Disproportionate and persistent thoughts about the seriousness of one's symptoms·Persistently high levels of anxiety about health or symptoms ·Excessive time and energy devoted to these symptoms or health concerns Although any one somatic symptom may not be continuously present， the state of being symp-tomatic is persistent (typically>6mo). Predominant pain is a specifier for individuals whose symptoms predominately involve pain.  |\n\n【31】Specify if persistent： A persistent course is characterized by severe symptoms， marked impairment， and long duration(>6 mo). Also specify ifmild， moderate， or severe.\n\n【32】Differential Diagnosis\n\n【33】Pain is a very common complaint in medicine. It is important that the patient undergo an evaluation for all medical or surgical illnesses that could cause the pain. Patients with depression and/or anxiety can sometimes present with a primary complaint of pain； however， on evaluation， the depressive symptoms predominate. Patients with hypochondriasis can complain of pain symptoms， but the main clini-cal feature is a conviction that they have a serious medical illness. Patients with factitious disorder falsify an injury or illness. Patients who are malingering can con-sciously present false reports of pain in order to achieve secondary gain (such as financial compensation or evading the police by being hospitalized). Patients with pain disorders often use substances to relieve distress， which can mask the pain disorder or other medical illness.\n\n【34】Ireatment\n\n【35】When treating a patient with pain disorder， the clinician must accept that the con-dition is often chronic and that the goal of pain relief can be unrealistic； providing gradual improvement of functioning is a more reasonable approach. Although the provider must validate the existence of the patient's pain， education about the con-tributing effect of psychological factors and constant reassurance is important. The use of antidepressants can be an effective pharmacologic approach； both tricyclics and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been shown to be helpful. These agents work by decreasing comorbid depression or by exerting an indepen-dent analgesic effect. Analgesic medications are generally not helpful， and the patient has usually tried this approach before seeking treatment. Narcotic analgesics should be avoided given their abuse and withdrawal potential. Biofeedback is help-ful in certain pain disorders， specifically headaches and muscle tension. Hypnosis and nerve stimulation are also used. Psychodynamic psychotherapy focused on the impact of the disorder on the patient's life can be helpful. Yoga has also shown ben-efit by improving functionality and for its mindfulness component. For treatment-resistant individuals， comprehensive pain clinics (either inpatient or outpatient) should be considered.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:33:40", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:33:55", "cost": 14.834}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:00", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:33:54", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:33:39"}

Antiviral Agents\n\n【1】The 3 major classes of antiviral agents are DNA polymerase inhibitors, reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and protease inhibitors. It should be noted that HIV treatment usually includes the use of at least 2 reverse transcriptase inhibitors and 1 protease inhibitor. DNA polymerase inhibitors are subdivided into nucleoside and nonnucleoside. Drugs may target viral nucleic acid replication such as DNA polymerase either via nucleoside (purine or pyrimidine analogs) such as acyclovir or ribavirin, or by attacking a unique viral process needed in nucleic acid synthesis such as viral pyrophosphate (nonnucleoside type). Antiviral drugs used to treat herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection can be classified as either nucleosides or non-nucleosides, or according to their site of action in the viral replicative cycle, or according to their clinical use.\n\n【2】### COMMON ANTIVIRAL AGENTS\n\n【3】Influenza\n\n【4】Amantadine and rimantadine are primarily used against infections caused by the influenza A virus. Their mechanism of action is interfering with viral uncoating. Both agents are fairly well absorbed orally and cause some minor central nervous system (CNS) effects (rimantadine less so) and minor gastrointestinal (GI) effects .\n\n【5】Table II-4 • PARTIAL LISTING OF ANTIVIRAL MEDICATIONS\n\n【6】### HERPES VIRUS\n\n【7】Acyclovir is used against HSV types 1 and 2. Acyclovir, a nucleoside DNA polymerase inhibitor, is a deoxyguanosine triphosphate analog, which is incorporated into the viral DNA and causes DNA chain termination. Its specificity is a result of the presence of herpes-specific thymidine kinase in infected cells, which phosphorylates acyclovir 100 times more efficiently than by uninfected cells. Acyclovir can be topically used, orally for recurrent genital herpes, and intravenously for immunocompromised patients or herpes encephalitis. Its adverse effects include headache, nausea, and rarely nephrotoxicity with intravenous use. Valacyclovir is an analog of acyclovir and is converted to acyclovir in the body. Its advantage is better bioavailability. See Table II-5 for listing of agents against herpes viruses.\n\n【8】Table II-5 • AGENTS USED TO TREAT HERPES VIRUS INFECTIONS (ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION)\n\n【9】Penciclovir is converted to the triphosphate form and inhibits viral DNA polymerase. Famciclovir is converted to the active agent penciclovir in the body. Penciclovir is used topically to treat herpes labialis “cold sores”; famciclovir is used for genital herpes or herpes zoster. Headache and GI effects are common. Ganciclovir is structurally similar to acyclovir and must be converted to the triphosphate form to be active; it competes with deoxyguanosine triphosphate for incorporation into viral DNA, thereby inhibiting DNA polymerase. Its primary role is against CMV and is far more effective than acyclovir. Ganciclovir can induce serious myelosuppression.\n\n【10】Foscarnet is a synthetic nonnucleoside analog of pyrophosphate and inhibits DNA polymerase or HIV reverse transcriptase by directly binding to the pyrophosphate-binding site. Its use is usually for acyclovir resistant herpes or CMV retinitis. Significant nephrotoxicity may occur with its use.\n\n【11】Sorivudine is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog and, on being converted to the triphosphate form, is active against herpes DNA synthesis. It is effective against VZV and is usually well tolerated. Idoxuridine is an iodinated thymidine analog, which inhibits herpes DNA synthesis in its triphosphate form. It is used primarily topically for herpes keratitis. Adverse effects include pain and inflammation. Vidarabine is an adenosine analog, which also needs to be in its triphosphate form and blocks herpes-specific DNA polymerase. It has been used for herpes encephalitis or zoster in immunocompromised individuals; however, because of its nephrotoxicity, it has largely been supplanted by acyclovir. Trifluridine is a fluorinated pyrimidine nucleoside analog. Its monophosphate form inhibits thymidylate synthetase and triphosphate form inhibits DNA polymerase. It is active against HSV types 1 and 2 and CMV, and it is used primarily against keratoconjunctivitis and recurrent keratitis.\n\n【12】### ANTI-HIV AGENTS\n\n【13】Retrovir (azidothymidine or zidovudine) inhibits viral reverse transcriptase when its triphosphate form is incorporated into the nucleic acid and blocks further DNA chain elongation, leading to termination of the DNA. In addition, the monophosphate form of Retrovir may block deoxythymidine kinase and inhibit the production of normal dTTp. Its principal role is treating HIV infection, and adverse effects include headache, bone marrow suppression, fever, and abdominal pain.\n\n【14】Didanosine is also a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, primarily used as an adjunct to Retrovir, or for those patients with HIV infection intolerant or unresponsive to zidovudine. Peripheral neuropathy and pancreatic damage are its adverse effects. Stavudine is a thymidine nucleoside analog that inhibits HIV-1 replication and that is used in patients with HIV infection unresponsive to other therapies.\n\n【15】### PROTEASE INHIBITORS\n\n【16】Invirase or saquinavir blocks HIV protease activity, rendering the virus unable to generate essential proteins and enzymes including reverse transcriptase. It is used in combination with a conventional reverse transcriptase inhibitor.### Part 3. Antifungal Agents\n\n【17】In addition to the pyrimidine analog, flucytosine, and the penicillium-derived antifungal agent, griseofulvin, the 3 major classes of antifungal agents are the polyene macrolides, azoles, and allylamines .\n\n【18】Table II-6 • SELECTED ANTIFUNGAL DRUGS\n\n【19】Of all the available antifungal agents, amphotericin B has the broadest spectrum of activity, including activity against yeast, mycoses, and molds. It is the drug of choice for disseminated or invasive fungal infections in immunocompromised patients. The major adverse effect resulting from amphotericin B administration is the almost invariable renal toxicity that results from decreased renal blood flow and from tubular and basement membrane destruction that may be irreversible and may require dialysis. Other adverse effects of amphotericin B relate to its intravenous infusion and include fever, chills, vomiting, hypotension, and headache that can be ameliorated somewhat by careful monitoring and slow infusion.\n\n【20】The azole antifungal agents have a broad spectrum of activity, including activity against candidiasis, mycoses, and dermatophytes, among many others. As topical agents they are relatively safe. Administered orally, their most common adverse effect is GI dysfunction. Hepatic dysfunction may rarely occur. Oral azoles are contraindicated for use with midazolam and triazolam because of potentiation of their hypnotic and sedative effects, and with β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors because of an increased risk of rhabdomyolysis. Itraconazole has been associated with heart failure when used to treat onychomycosis and, therefore, should not be used in patients with ventricular abnormalities. Monitoring patients who receive itraconazole for potential hepatic toxicity is also highly recommended. Voriconazole frequently causes an acute blurring of vision with changes in color perception that resolves quickly.\n\n【21】The allylamine antifungal agents, naftifine and terbinafine, are used topically to treat dermatophytes. Contact with mucous membranes may lead to local irritation and erythema and should be avoided. Terbinafine administered orally is effective against the onychomycosis. Monitoring for potential hepatic toxicity is highly recommended.\n\n【22】Flucytosine is active against only a relatively restricted range of fungal infections. Because of rapid development of resistance, it is used concomitantly for its synergistic effects with other antifungal agents. The most commonly reported adverse effect is bone marrow suppression, probably because of the toxicity of the metabolite fluorouracil, and should be continuously monitored. Other reported less common adverse effects include reversible hepatotoxicity, enterocolitis, and hair loss.\n\n【23】Griseofulvin, the use of which is declining relative to terbinafine and itraconazole, is an effective antifungal agent that is used only systemically to treat a very limited range of dermatophyte infections. The most common adverse effects include hypersensitivity (fever, skin rash, serum-sickness–like syndrome) and headache. It is teratogenic.\n\n【24】### MECHANISM OF ACTION\n\n【25】Nystatin and amphotericin B bind to ergosterol, a major component of fungal cell membranes. This disrupts the stability of the cell by forming pores in the cell membrane that result in leakage of intracellular constituents. Bacteria are not susceptible to these agents because they lack ergosterol.\n\n【26】Azoles (imidazoles less so) have a greater affinity for fungal than human cytochrome P <sub>450 </sub> enzymes and, therefore, more effectively reduce the synthesis of fungal cell ergosterol than human cell cholesterol.\n\n【27】The allylamine antifungal agents, naftifine and terbinafine, decrease ergosterol synthesis and increase fungal membrane disruption by inhibiting the enzyme squalene epoxidase.\n\n【28】Flucytosine must first be transported into fungal cells via a cytosine permease and converted to 5-fluorouracil and then sequentially converted to 5-fluorodeoxyuridylic acid, which disrupts DNA synthesis by inhibiting thymidylate synthetase. Human cells are unable to synthesize the active flucytosine metabolites.\n\n【29】The mechanism of antifungal action of griseofulvin is not definitely known. It acts only on growing skin cells and has been reported to inhibit cell wall synthesis, interfere with nucleic acid synthesis, and disrupt microtubule function, among other activities.\n\n【30】### ADMINISTRATION\n\n【31】Amphotericin B is insoluble in water; therefore, it is generally administered as a colloidal suspension with sodium deoxycholate. Because of its poor absorption from the GI tract, amphotericin B must be given intravenously to treat systemic disease, although it is effective orally for fungal infections within the GI lumen. Likewise, nystatin is poorly absorbed but may also be used for fungal infection of the GI tract. It is too toxic for systemic use; therefore, it is mostly used topically to treat fungal infections of the skin and mucous membranes (eg, oropharyngeal thrush, vaginal candidiasis). Costly lipid formulations of amphotericin B are available for intravenous use, which reduce its nonspecific binding to cholesterol of human cell membranes and, thus, its potential to cause renal damage. Griseofulvin is administered in a microparticulate form to improve absorption.### Part 4. Antiparasitic Agents\n\n【32】Parasitic infections affect one-half of the world’s population and are particularly prevalent in developing countries. Immunocompromised individuals such as those with HIV infection are also prone to parasitic disease. These medications can be categorized as active against malaria, toxoplasmosis, Cyclospora, cryptosporidia, Pneumocystis, amebiasis, leishmaniasis, helminths, trematodes, and cestodes .\n\n【33】Table II-7 • DRUGS FOR PARASITES\n\n【34】MICROBIOLOGY PEARLS\n\n【35】 β-lactam antibiotics inactivate bacterial transpeptidases and prevent the cross-linking of peptidoglycan polymers essential for cell wall integrity.\n\n【36】 Both penicillin and amoxicillin are susceptible to β-lactamases.\n\n【37】 To prevent its metabolism to a nephrotoxic metabolite, imipenem is administered with an inhibitor of renal tubule dehydropeptidase, cilastatin.\n\n【38】 Vancomycin, which is unaffected by β-lactamases, is active against gram-positive bacteria.\n\n【39】 Chloramphenicol can cause GI disturbances, reversible suppression of bone marrow, and rarely plastic anemia.\n\n【40】 Aminoglycosides may cause ototoxicity or nephrotoxicity and should be used with caution in those patients who have renal insufficiency or who are elderly.\n\n【41】 The primary strategy of antiviral agents is to attack a unique but vital viral enzyme or process.\n\n【42】 The three major types of antiviral agents include DNA polymerase inhibitors, reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and protease inhibitors.\n\n【43】 HIV therapy usually uses at least two reverse transcriptase inhibitors and one protease inhibitor.\n\n【44】 Didanosine is also a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor for HIV infections and is associated with peripheral neuropathy and pancreatic damage.\n\n【45】 Foscarnet is a synthetic nonnucleoside analog of pyrophosphate and is associated with reversible nephrotoxicity; hypo- or hypercalcemia and phosphatemia that may lead to neural and cardiac dysfunction. In addition, hallucinations, genital ulceration, and anemia may occur.\n\n【46】 Itraconazole has been associated with heart failure when used to treat onychomycosis and, therefore, should not be used in patients with ventricular abnormalities.\n\n【47】 A common side effect of griseofulvin is hypersensitivity.\n\n【48】 Because of renal toxicity, amphotericin B is often used to initiate a clinical response before substituting a continuing maintenance dose of an azole.\n删除16：<u>### REFERENCES\n通用删除2(英):<u>删除20：<u>Gale EF, Cundliffe E, Reynolds PE, et al .

The constellation of ocular， nasal， and pulmonary symptoms temporally related to work and environmental conditions to a common allergen is suspicious for occupational-related asthma. The physical examination also is consistent with this diagnosis.1\\. Recognize the presenting signs and symptoms of the common causes of wheezing.\n\n【7】2\\.

Implement the treatment and management of asthma in children and adults.Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases in the United States， and is accountable for a substantial number of emergency department evaluations and hospitalizations， many of which are preventable with appropriate management. It is diagnosed in approximately 10% of children and 5% of young adults with increasing prevalence in economically developed countries. Genetic and environ-mental factors play a significant role in the development of asthma. Work-related asthma is implicated in at least 10% of asthma cases in adults. Pathologic changes to the airways reflect inflammatory and remodeling changes including inflamma-tory cell infiltration， basement membrane thickening， shedding of epithelial cells， proliferation and engorgement of blood vessels， mucus plugging， smooth muscle hypertrophy， and fibrosis.| Table 56-1·DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS FOR WHEEZING  |\n| --- |\n| Allergic rhinitis and sinusitis Foreign body in trachea or bronchus Vocal cord dysfunction Vascular rings or laryngeal webs Laryngotracheomalacia，tracheal stenosis， or bronchostenosis Enlarged lymph nodes or tumor (benign or malignant) Bronchiectasis of various causes， including cystic fibrosis Viral bronchiolitis or obliterative bronchiolitis Cystic fibrosis Bronchopulmonary dysplasia Pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (chronic bronchitis or emphysema) Pulmonary embolism Congestive heart failure Cough secondary to drugs (angiotensin-converting enzyme \\[ACE\\] inhibitors) Aspiration from swallowing mechanism dysfunction or gastroesophageal reflux Recurrent cough not due to asthma  |\n删除21：<u>Adapted from Sveum R.

Additional studies，tailored to the specific patient and symptoms， include the following：Pharmacologic measures to treat and manage asthma are instituted in a stepwise fashion based on staging of asthma (Table56-4). Subcutaneous immunotherapy is an option for any patient with persistent allergic asthma in stages 2 to 4.Short-acting B，-agonists (SABAs) are the most effective therapy for prompt relief of asthmatic symptoms. Albuterol， levalbuterol， and pirbuterol are the SABAs used in the United States and are generally considered equally effective in onset and duration of action. They have an onset of action of 5 minutes or less， peak in 30 to60 minutes， and last 4 to 6 hours. They should be used only as needed for relief of symptoms or before anticipated exposure to known asthmatic triggers (eg， animals， exercise).Metered-dose inhaler (MDI) actuations can be taken in 10- to 15-second intervals， and nebulized treatment doses can be given continuously in severe cases. Increasing use or using them more than 2 days per week for symptom relief (not for prevention) generally indicates inadequate control of asthma or persistent asthma.

If patients are not controlled with MDIs， the clinician should ensure that the medications are being used in the appropriate dosing intervals.

The bone is well delineated with a narrow  删除换行1: zone of transition, an appearance suggesting the lesion is benign. No fracture is seen.\n\n【14】The appearance is in keeping with an exostosis, also known as an osteochondroma, that  删除换行1: results from dysplasia of the growth plate. This may be solitary or multiple in a condition  删除换行1: known as multiple hereditary exostosis (or diaphyseal aclasis), or rarely as part of various  删除换行1: syndromes such as Turner’s syndrome or tuberous sclerosis.\n\n【15】Rather than take more images of the arm, the best course of action would be to obtain  删除换行1: previous images.

In this patient, a previous skeletal  删除换行1: image on PACS  suggests the  删除换行1: diagnosis of multiple hereditary exostosis.\n删除3：<u>Figure 16.2 AP radiograph of both legs  删除换行1: showing large right proximal and distal lateral  删除换行1: tibial exostoses and bilateral proximal medial  删除换行1: tibial exostoses .</u>\n\n【16】Multiple hereditary exostosis is inherited  删除换行1: as an autosomal dominant trait, with an  删除换行1: incidence of about 1 in 50000. Children are  删除换行1: diagnosed on average around 3 years old. \n\n【17】As seen in this case, bony growths (exos删除8：<u>￾</u>toses) arise from the metaphyses, point  删除换行1: away from epiphysis, and extend down  删除换行1: the diaphysis during growth. They increase  删除换行1: in size and number with age, arising in  删除换行1: several characteristic sites.

She initially noted numbness and heaviness in her bilateral lower extremities 3 weeks prior to presentation. She had some mild unsteadiness while standing and walking. Over the next 3 weeks, she developed paresthesias in her bilateral toes that ascended up both legs as well as aching lower back pain. She had two episodes of fecal incontinence on the day prior to presentation. She noted loss of sensation in the perineal area. She denied any changes in sensation or strength in her bilateral upper extremities. She had no vision changes, including diplopia. She endorsed a 15-lb weight loss over the past few months. She denied any fevers, and she had not had any recent exposures or travel.\n\n【3】This is a concerning history . What draws your attention, and why are you concerned? Everything she reports seems like a pertinent positive, and there are multiple “red flags” for a serious illness. However, rather than using her history to jump to potential pathologic diagnoses, can these “red flags” also help us quickly localize the lesion? Try to think about why certain features of her history stand out, and what their potential localizations are. This will help us to more quickly and easily make the pathologic diagnosis .\n\n【4】On examination, she was well-appearing, but thin. She had a soft, several-centimeter mass over her left parietal convexity, which was non-tender. She had no surrounding skin changes or hair loss. Her mental status was normal. There were no cranial nerve abnormalities. Muscle tone was normal throughout. Her strength was normal in the upper extremities. She had hip flexor weakness (4−) bilaterally. Hip abduction and knee extension were both full strength. Knee flexion was weak, 4 on the right and 4+ on the left. Right ankle dorsiflexion strength was 4. The rest of her strength was full in the lower extremities. Sensory testing revealed diminished vibration bilaterally at the toes and impaired proprioception. She had a positive Romberg test. She had decreased tone of her anal sphincter and perineal sensory loss. Her reflexes were diminished in the bilateral lower extremities with the exception of the left Achilles reflex, which was relatively spared. Her toes were down-going. There was no dysmetria, and she walked with a wide-based gait.### What is the pace?\n\n【5】She presents with symptoms that developed over weeks, which is consistent with a subacute time course of disease.### What is the localization?\n\n【6】She presents with gait difficulty, and her symptoms and examination reveal motor, sensory, and bowel dysfunction. Although she has weakness, she has no features of damage to the upper motor neurons—she has no spasticity, and her reflexes are diminished with down-going toes. This would seem to indicate that the lesion doesn’t involve the central nervous system; rather, it localizes to the peripheral nervous system.\n\n【7】When a patient has multiple deficits, it is often helpful to hone in on the deficit(s) that are uncommon or have more specific localizations rather than starting with something nonspecific such as difficulty walking. In her case, her fecal incontinence, decreased anal sphincter tone, and saddle anesthesia are the most striking. All of these signs and symptoms indicate sacral dysfunction. These deficits could arise either from the lower spinal cord (such as in conus medullaris syndrome), the sacral nerve roots (such as in cauda equina syndrome), or the lumbosacral plexus. In contrast to the challenges we would run into if we attempted to start by localizing leg weakness (which could be from her cortex down to the muscle), we can immediately narrow down our localization to a few spots in nervous system .\n\n【8】删除3：<u>Figure 13.1 The segments of the spinal cord: cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and sacral.

First, she has notable sparing of the upper extremities. Second, the weakness in her lower extremities involves the proximal as well as distal muscles without any apparent pattern. Third, both extremities are affected, but asymmetrically. Whenever anything is asymmetric and not length dependent, we must always think about multiple radiculopathies, a plexopathy, or multiple neuropathies. For example, if this were a myopathy, we might expect proximal muscles to be affected more than distal muscles. If this were an isolated neuropathy or radiculopathy (such as a peroneal neuropathy or L4 radiculopathy), then we might expect isolated muscle involvement or specific patterns. This asymmetric and non–length-dependent weakness in her lower extremities fits with either multiple lumbar radiculopathies or a lumbosacral plexopathy as discussed earlier.\n\n【11】We are left with a process that involves either the lumbosacral nerve roots (such as in cauda equina or conus medullaris syndrome) or a lumbosacral plexopathy. Her history includes one clue that may make a plexopathy less likely. She has aching low back pain, which is more typical of cauda equina or conus medullaris syndrome over a plexopathy. Questions that arise on examinations tend to overstate the differences in distinguishing conus medullaris and cauda equina syndrome (and even lumbosacral plexopathies). In clinical practice, there is frequently overlap of many of the symptoms of these entities, and the underlying disease may impact both the lower cord and the lumbosacral nerve roots. However, if we had to choose one final localization, perhaps a cauda equina syndrome is more likely due to three possible reasons. Can you identify any?\n\n【12】First, she has asymmetric motor deficits, which we might expect to be more likely in a disorder where multiple nerve roots are differentially affected rather than in the conus. Second, her reflexes are diminished as opposed to increased, which we might expect if upper motor neurons were involved. Third, her bowel dysfunction came late in the time course of disease, which is more common in cauda equina syndrome. This is not a major point and not particularly relevant in clinical practice.### What is the differential diagnosis?\n\n【13】Our patient is a 65-year-old woman who presents with a syndromic diagnosis of subacute onset of a cauda equina syndrome.### What is the etiologic diagnosis?\n\n【14】The etiologic diagnoses for subacute neurologic syndromes in this case are relatively broad and include inflammatory, infectious, and neoplastic disorders. Undoubtedly, there is a long list of esoteric and rare disorders that could be causing this syndrome. Can the context of her presentation help us narrow down the differential diagnosis any further?\n\n【15】There are two notable features of her history and exam. The first is that she has had 15 lbs of unintentional weight loss. The second is that she has a calvarial mass. Admittedly, these can’t rule in or rule out many diagnoses, but they do raise the suspicion for a neoplastic disorder, especially with the lack of context for her to have developed an infection, as the pathologic diagnosis of her presentation.

These regions include peripheral nerves, skin in non-intertriginous area, testes, and the anterior chambers of the eye. The clinical presentation of leprosy varies depending on the disease state. In 1966, Ridley and Jopling divided the disease activity spectrum of leprosy into distinct forms that are still used today. These forms take into account the host’s immunopathologic response to M. leprae and are listed in order by decreasing cell-mediated immunity and increasing disease severity: Tuberculoid leprosy (TT), Borderline tuberculoid leprosy (BT), Midborderline leprosy (BB), Borderline lepromatous leprosy (BL) and Lepromatous leprosy (LL) .\n\n【23】删除3：<u>Figure 14.1\n\n【24】H&E 100× Leprosy. A granulomatous inflammation with scant lymphocytic infiltrates (Polar Tuberculoid Leprosy pattern)</u>\n\n【25】Tuberculoid leprosy represents the immunologically stable, pauci-bacillary form of the disease. It is characterized by a strong cellular response with a weak humoral response from the host. There is typically one large, anesthetic erythematous macule or hypopigmented plaque with a well-defined border and atrophic center that may be found on the face or limbs but usually not on the scalp or in the intertriginous regions. The lesions seen in BT are more abundant and smaller in size with peripheral spread and resolving centers. Thickened nerves and loss of function are commonly seen especially with the greater auricular and superficial peroneal nerves. Patients with mid borderline leprosy present with sharply defined annular plaques. Patients with BL have a varied presentation with multiple, symmetrical macules, papules, and nodules found anywhere on the body. These lesions sometimes appear “punched out” and are hypesthetic. The TT is considered the stable form and appear as sharply defined, reddish-brown plaques. The LL form represents systemic involvement, but in the skin, symmetrical, multiple small macules, plaques with poorly defined borders.\n\n【26】Leprosy causes peripheral neuropathy that affects small nerve fibers that convey temperature, touch, pain, and deep pressure. Lepra reactions occur when there is an acute change in the patient’s immune status. The lepra reactions are divided into Type 1 and Type 2. Type 1 lepra reactions consist of swelling of previous plaques and sudden development of new nodules. This type of reaction can be seen in any form of leprosy but is most common in the borderline leprosy stage. Type 2 lepra reactions are also referred to as erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) and are characterized by tender pink nodules on the extremities with systemic symptoms that may include fever, arthralgias, neuritic pain, uveitis, and orchitis. This reaction only occurs in BL and LL patients.\n\n【27】Pathology\n---------\n\n【28】The majority of cases are found in Brazil, Nepal, India, Burma, Indonesia, and Madagascar. The cases reported in the United States are typically due to vacationers traveling in endemic regions or immigrants moving from those countries. It is transmitted by respiratory droplets and requires close contact for an extended period of time in order to acquire the disease. The incubation period of M. leprae spans 5–30 years. Armadillos, chimpanzees, and managabey monkeys are animal reservoirs for the bacillus.\n\n【29】The diagnosis of leprosy can be confirmed using slit skin smears, skin biopsy with acid-fast stains, polymerase chain reaction or peripheral nerve biopsy. Mycosis fungoides has an annular appearance, but microscopically there is a proliferation of atypical lymphocytes found in the epidermis that shows minimal spongiosis. These lymphocytes can either be CD4 or CD8 positive. T cell gene rearrangement studies can be done for confirmation. Another annular lesion is subacute lupus. Lupus presents microscopically with an interface lymphocytic infiltrates with some dermal mucin. Direct immunofluorescent studies may show granular deposits of IgG, IgM and fibrin. Serological studies for ANA can be performed. Tinea corporis is readily diagnosed by a PAS or GMS staining which reveals multiple fungal elements within the cornified layer whereas syphilis typically has numerous plasma cells.\n\n【30】Treatment Options\n-----------------\n\n【31】Leprosy is curable with a multi-drug treatment regimen of dapsone, rifampin, and clofazimine for a period of 6–12 months. Once the patient is being treated they are no longer contagious. Patients experiencing lepra reactions can be treated with corticosteroids.\n\n【32】Prevention\n----------\n\n【33】Avoid travel to endemic areas or close contact with infected individuals. Those diagnosed with lepromatous leprosy are the most contagious and household family members should be treated simultaneously.\n删除16：<u>Recommended Reading\n\n【34】1.\n\n【35】Bolognia JL.

How do you counsel her regarding her life expectancy?\n\n【1】A.She has no different life expectancy than age-matched controls.\n\n【2】B.She has a longer life expectancy than age-matched controls.\n\n【3】C.She has a shorter life expectancy than age-matched controls because of increased risk of infection.\n\n【4】D.She has a shorter life expectancy than age-matched controls because of premature atherosclerosis in the setting of systemic inflammation.\n\n【5】43.2You are working in a hand clinic and see a large population of patients with preexisting diagnoses of rheumatoid arthritis. Which of the following patients do you expect to have a more aggressive form of rheumatoid arthritis?\n\n【6】A. A 45-year-old woman who is positive for RF and anti-CCP.\n\n【7】B.A 65-year-old woman who is positive for RF and negative for anti-CCP.\n\n【8】C.A 60-year-old man who has a low positive ANA titer， a negative RF， and a negative anti-CCP.\n\n【9】D. A 60-year-old woman with a negative RF and a negative anti-CCP.\n\n【10】43.3A 50-year-old woman presents to your office with complaints of morning pains in her PIPs， MCPs， and wrists. After positive serologic testing， the diagnosis of rheumatic arthritis is made. Which of these treatment regimens is most appropriate!\n\n【11】A. Ibuprofen 800 mg orally every 8 hours until symptoms improve\n\n【12】B. Methotrexate 15 mg orally once weekly and prednisone 40 mg orally daily， with a short taper of prednisone\n\n【13】C.Etanercept 50 mg subcutaneously every week\n\n【14】D. Prednisone 40 mg orally once daily until symptoms improve\n\n【15】43.4A 62-year-old woman with a 15-year history of rheumatoid arthritis is seen in your office for follow-up. Her symptoms are predominantly located in her bilateral MCPs and PIPs and have been moderately controlled on a DMARD regimen. Follow-up x-rays of her hands are obtained. Which of the follow-ing radiographic descriptions is most commonly associated with rheumatoid arthritis?\n\n【16】A. Asymmetric joint space narrowing\n\n【17】B.Symmetric joint space narrowing and juxtaarticular bone erosions\n\n【18】C.Multiple fractures of different stages of healing\n\n【19】D. Bone erosion with an overhanging edge\n\n【20】Radio-opaque depositions throughout the joint space and mildjoint effusion\n\n【21】ANSWERS\n\n【22】43.11D. Patients with RA have a shorter life expectancy， thought to be related to systemic inflammation， which causes premature atherosclerosis. Life expec-tancy in RA patients， however， is likely improving as our management of RA becomes more aggressive and new treatment options are introduced. RA patients are at increased risk of infection， especially with some treatments， so it is important to administer the flu vaccine annually， as well as the pneumo-coccal vaccination.\n\n【23】43.2A. The presence of RF and anti-CCP antibodies are both associated with more severe disease. A low titer ANA in most patients without additional symp-toms to suggest an alternative diagnosis is likely of no immediate significance.\n\n【24】43.3B. Steroids should not be used for extended periods of time but are useful to gain quick control of disease activity as a bridge to a DMARD， such as metho-trexate， which is appropriate chronic therapy. Generally， TNF inhibitors， such as etanercept， and other biologic DMARDs are not used as first-line therapy except in severe disease. High-dose NSAIDs， such as ibuprofen， are not suit-able monotherapy for RA， as they do not slow the progression of disease and carry potentially severe side effects.\n\n【25】43.4B. Symmetric joint space narrowing and juxtaarticular bone erosions may be seen in rheumatoid arthritis. Very early in the disease course， periarticular osteopenia may be noted， or the joint may appear normal. In gout， x-rays may show bone erosions with an overhanging edge， suggestive of both atrophy and hypertrophy. Similarly， osteoarthritis may cause osteophyte growth with an overhanging edge-like appearance. Asymmetric joint space narrowing is seen in joints affected by osteoarthritis. Radio-opaque depositions through-out the joint space is descriptive of chondrocalcinosis， a radiographic finding most often associated with pseudogout. In pseudogout， radio-opaque calcium-pyrophosphate crystals are deposited in the joint and cause inflammatory states that may lead to joint effusions.\n\n【26】CLINICAL PEARLS\n\n【27】RA is a chronic， progressive， symmetric inflammatory polyarthritis that causes bony erosions and joint deformity ifuntreated.\n\n【28】At some point in the disease's course， most patients are positive for RF， anti-CCP， or both. Some patients are seronegative (negative for RF and anti-CCP).\n\n【29】Sjogren syndrome is the most common extraarticular manifestation of RA. Anemia is also very common.\n\n【30】Early treatment with DMARDs is key to limiting disease progression and subsequent disability.\n\n【31】Continuous reassessment is necessary to measure disease activity and adjust the treatment regimen.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 13:36:49", "endTime": "2024/09/14 13:38:43", "cost": 113.942}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:00", "update_time": "2024-09-13 21:38:43", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:51:05"}

Two weeks earlier he was diagnosed with penicillin-sensitive Streptococcus pyogenes on throat culture and was prescribed ciprofloxacin (since he is allergic to penicillin). Review of the patient’s medication history reveals a possible drug interaction. Which of the following medications is this patient most likely taking that would reduce the effectiveness of his antibiotic?\n\n【1】> (A) Aspirin\n\n【2】> (B) Calcium carbonate\n\n【3】> (C) Cimetidine\n\n【4】> (D) Misoprostol\n\n【5】> (E) Omeprazole\n\n【6】 Answer: The correct answer is B . The oral absorption of ciprofloxacin is impaired by divalent cations, including those in common antacids such as calcium carbonate, which this patient is likely taking to treat GERD. Ciprofloxacin belongs to the family of fluroquinolones, which block bacterial DNA synthesis by inhibiting bacterial DNA gyrase. Inhibition of DNA gyrase prevents the relaxation of positively supercoiled DNA that is required for normal transcription and replication.  \n\n【7】Answer A is incorrect . Unlike the other drugs listed, aspirin is not used as a pharmacotherapeutic agent for treating GERD. In fact, it is known to cause gastric ulcers. Although many patients take aspirin for its antiplatelet effect, this patient has no reason to be using aspirin. Furthermore, no drug interactions would be expected between aspirin and ciprofloxacin.  \n\n【8】Answer C is incorrect . Cimetidine, an H2 \\-receptor antagonist, is associated with gynecomastia, thrombocytopenia, and inhibition of the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) system. However, it does not significantly affect the metabolism or pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin.  \n\n【9】Answer D is incorrect . Misoprostol is a prostaglandin E1 analog that can be used to prevent NSAID-induced peptic ulcers. It is also used as a medical abortifacient in many countries and is therefore strictly contraindicated in pregnant women. Misoprostol would not decrease the absorption nor increase the metabolism of ciprofloxacin.  \n\n【10】Answer E is incorrect . Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor considered first-line therapy for GERD. Omeprazole decreases intragastric acidity, but does not affect the intestinal absorption, metabolism, or excretion of ciprofloxacin.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:24:27", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:25:55", "cost": 88.401}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:00", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:25:53", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:24:24"}

He says that for 2 or 3 days he had a sharp, burning pain radiating from his midback around to his left side. He thought that he was having a kidney stone. Yesterday he noticed a rash that spread in a distribution “like a line” in the same area in which he had the pain. His current medications are glyburide for type II diabetes, simvastatin for high cholesterol, and lisinopril for hypertension, each of which he has been taking for several years. He does have a history of chickenpox as a child. On examination he has a low-grade fever and otherwise normal vital signs. His skin examination is remarkable for a rash in a belt-like distribution from his spine around his left flank to the midline of the abdomen. The rash consists of erythematous patches with clusters of vesicles. The remainder of his examination is normal.

It causes a rash and frequently a painful neuropathy, usually in the distribution of a single dermatome. Rarely, Herpes zoster will affect several dermatomes, but should not cross the midline. Acyclovir can shorten the course of symptoms of herpes zoster, although it cannot eradicate latent virus. Acyclovir is a purine analog that is converted to a monophosphate form by a thymidine kinase, which is specific to viruses; this assures its specificity to infected cells. Host cellular enzymes then convert the monophosphate to a triphosphate form that competitively inhibits the activity of viral DNA polymerase. The triphosphate form also is incorporated into viral DNA, where it acts as a chain terminator because the missing 3’-hydroxyl group prevents the further addition of nucleosides. Acyclovir has a low oral bioavailability. It is excreted, largely unchanged, via the kidney. Valacyclovir is a prodrug form of acyclovir that has a greater oral bioavailability than acyclovir. It is rapidly and completely converted to acyclovir after absorption, resulting in higher concentrations of acyclovir.\n\n【11】APPROACH TO:\n\n【12】Pharmacology of Antiviral Drugs\n\n【13】#### OBJECTIVES\n\n【14】1\\.

Antiviral medications usually attack the virus prior to cell penetration, after the virus leaves the host cell, or while the virus is active within the host cell. Nonspecific effects may be harmful to the host. Figure 47–1 shows a schematic of the viral life cycle summarized, and Table 47–1 describes specific antiviral therapies aimed at the various viral maturation steps.\n\n【19】删除3：<u>Figure 47–1.</u>\n删除4：<u>Table 47–1 • EXAMPLES OF ANTIVIRAL MECHANISMS</u>\n\n【20】There are three main types of viruses: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> DNA viruses usually enter the host cell nucleus and direct the production of new viruses, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses direct the production of new viruses, usually without entering the host cell nucleus (an exception is influenza), and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> RNA retroviruses, such as HIV. Retroviruses contain an enzyme, reverse transcriptase that makes a DNA copy of the viral RNA; the DNA copy is spliced into the host DNA and directs the production of the new viruses.\n\n【21】Overview of Antiviral Agents The four major classes of antiviral agents are 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> DNA polymerase inhibitors, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> reverse transcriptase inhibitors, 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> protease inhibitors, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> fusion inhibitors. It should be noted that HIV treatment usually includes the use of three to four antiretroviral agents as standard of care. DNA polymerase inhibitors are categorized as nucleoside or nonnucleoside. Drugs may target viral nucleic acid replication such as DNA polymerase either via nucleoside (purine or pyrimidine analogs), such as acyclovir or ribavirin, or by attacking a unique viral process needed in nucleic acid synthesis, such as viral pyrophosphate (nonnucleo=side type).\n\n【22】Antiviral drugs used to treat herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, and cytomegalovirus can be classified as either nucleoside or nonnucleoside, or according to their site of action in the viral replicative cycle or according to their clinical use 删除25：<u></u>.\n\n【23】Common Antiviral Agents Influenza. Amantadine and rimantadine are primarily used against infections caused by influenza A. Their mechanism of action is interfering with viral uncoating. Anti-influenza agents decrease the duration of illness by 1 to 2 days and decrease the intensity of the illness by 50 percent. They must be started within the first 48 to 72 hours on onset to be effective. Both agents are fairly well absorbed orally and cause some minor central nervous system (CNS) effects (rimantadine less so) and minor GI effects.\n\n【24】Herpes Virus, Varicella-Zoster Virus/Cytomegalovirus Acyclovir is used against herpes simplex virus 1 and herpes simplex virus 2. Acyclovir, a nucleo-side DNA polymerase inhibitor, is a deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP) analog that is incorporated into the viral DNA and causes DNA chain termination. Its specificity is a result of the presence of herpes-specific thymidine kinase in infected cells, which phosphorylates acyclovir; this does not occur in uninfected cells. The acyclovir triphosphate is formed in infected cells and incorporated into infected cells’ DNA, and not formed in normal cells. Acyclovir can be used topically, orally for recurrent genital herpes, and IV for immunocompromised patients or herpes encephalitis. Its adverse effects include headache, nausea, and rarely nephrotoxicity with IV use. Valacyclovir is an analog of acyclovir and is converted to acyclovir in the body. Its advantage is better bioavailability.\n\n【25】Penciclovir is converted to the triphosphate form and inhibits viral DNA polymerase. Famciclovir is converted to the active agent penciclovir in the body. Their main use is to treat localized herpes zoster in immunocompromised patients. Headache and GI effects are common. Ganciclovir is structurally similar to acyclovir and must be converted to the triphosphate form to be active; it competes with dGTP for incorporation into viral DNA, thereby inhibiting DNA polymerase. Its primary role is against cytomegalovirus, and is far more effective than acyclovir against cytomegalovirus. Ganciclovir can induce serious myelosuppression.\n\n【26】Foscarnet is a synthetic nonnucleoside analog of pyrophosphate and inhibits DNA polymerase or HIV reverse transcriptase by directly binding to the pyrophosphate-binding site. Its use is usually for acyclovir-resistant herpes or cytomegalovirus retinitis. Significant nephrotoxicity may occur with its use.\n\n【27】Trifluridine is a fluorinated pyrimidine nucleoside analog. Its monophosphate form inhibits thymidylate synthetase, and its triphosphate form inhibits DNA polymerase. It is active against herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 and cytomegalovirus, and it is used primarily against keratoconjunctivitis and recurrent keratitis.\n\n【28】HIV is typically treated using three antiretroviral drugs simultaneously, from at least two of the five classes, which include nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (zidovudine also called AZT, abacavir, lamivudine, stavudine, didanosine), nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (nevirapine, efavirenz, delavirdine), protease inhibitors (indinavir, nelfinavir, saquinavir), fusion inhibitors (enfuvirtide), integrase inhibitors (raltegravir), and CCR5 antagonists (maraviroc).\n\n【29】Hepatitis C Virus Hepatitis C virus is treated with interferon and ribavirin. Interferon is typically administered in the form of peginterferon; pegylation increases the half-life and decreases immunogenicity. Interferon is a nonnucleoside transcription inhibitor. Ribavirin inhibits RNA polymerase activity, thereby inhibiting the initiation and synthesis of RNA fragments. Patients with hepatitis C genotype 1 may also benefit from the addition of a protease inhibitor (telaprevir or bocepravir), which are inhibitors of the nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) complex to inhibit replication of the hepatitis C virus. Telapravir can inhibit this complex in other hepatitis C genotypes, but bocepravir specifically acts on hepatitis C genotype 1. Protease inhibitors are not recommended for genotypes 2, 3. and 4.\n\n【30】Interferon is associated with significant adverse effects, including fatigue, arthralgias, depression, and suicidality.\n\n【31】##### Structure\n\n【32】Valacyclovir, famciclovir, and valganciclovir: Ester prodrugs of, respectively, acyclovir, penciclovir, and ganciclovir.\n\n【33】Cidofovir: Phosphonate analog of cytidine.\n\n【34】Idoxuridine, stavudine, zidovudine: Analog of thymidine.\n\n【35】Lamivudine: Analog of cytosine.\n\n【36】Abacavir: Analog of guanosine.\n\n【37】Didanosine: analog of adenosine\n\n【38】Table 47–2 presents a partial listing of antiviral agents and mechanisms of action, and Table 47–3 presents the agents used to treat herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, and cytomegalovirus.\n删除4：<u>Table 47–2 • PARTIAL LISTING OF ANTIVIRAL AGENTS AND MECHANISMS OF ACTION</u>\n删除4：<u>Table 47–3 • AGENTS USED TO TREAT HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS, VARICELLA-ZOSTER VIRUS, AND CYTOMEGALOVIRUS (ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION)</u>\n\n【39】##### Mechanism of Action\n\n【40】Valacyclovir, ganciclovir, and valganciclovir act like acyclovir.\n\n【41】Idoxuridine and famciclovir and the prodrug famciclovir, which is converted to the active agent penciclovir, also act like acyclovir except that they do not cause DNA chain termination.\n\n【42】Trifluridine (activated by host cell phosphorylation) and foscarnet (acts directly to inhibit viral DNA polymerase and RNA polymerase) do not require activation by viral thymidine kinase for their activity and therefore can be used to treat acyclovir-resistant viral infections.\n\n【43】Cidofovir is phosphorylated to mono- and diphosphate nucleotides by cellular kinases and, therefore, accumulates in both infected and uninfected cells. As a diphosphate, cidofovir inhibits and serves as an alternative dCTP substrate for viral DNA polymerase, resulting in inhibition of viral DNA synthesis and termination of chain elongation.\n\n【44】Fomivirsen is an antisense oligonucleotide that binds to the major immediate early region 2 (IE <sub>2 </sub> ) of cytomegalovirus mRNA to prevent its translation to protein and therefore to block viral replication.\n\n【45】Neverapine, efavirenz, and delavirdine bind to reverse trancriptase to inhibit its activity.\n\n【46】##### Administration\n\n【47】Acyclovir: Administered IV and orally and is used as a topical agent.\n\n【48】Foscarnet: Reserved to treat acyclovir-resistant viral infections and can only be administered IV.\n\n【49】Valacyclovir, famciclovir: Available only for oral use.\n\n【50】Ganciclovir: Administered orally; parenterally (IV); and as an intraocular, slow-release implant.\n\n【51】Penciclovir, trifluridine, idoxuridine: Available only for topical use.\n\n【52】Cidofovir: Administered parenterally with probenecid to block its active tubular secretion.\n\n【53】Fomivirsen: Administered by intravitreal injection.\n\n【54】##### Pharmacokinetics\n\n【55】Acyclovir: Low oral bioavailability.\n\n【56】Vlacyclovir: An ester prodrug with greater oral bioavailability than acyclovir that is rapidly and completely converted to acyclovir after absorption.\n\n【57】Famciclovir, valganciclovir: Ester prodrugs that are rapidly converted by first-pass metabolism to their respective active agents, penciclovir and ganciclovir.\n\n【58】NNRTI and PI agents are metabolized by and induce the cypP450 enzyme system (3A4), resulting in numerous drug-drug interactions.\n\n【59】####", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【38】Table 47–2 presents a partial listing of antiviral agents and mechanisms of action, and Table 47–3 presents the agents used to treat herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, and cytomegalovirus.", "content": "【0】### CASE 47\n\n【1】A 58-year-old man presents for the evaluation of a painful rash.

Interferon is typically administered in the form of peginterferon; pegylation increases the half-life and decreases immunogenicity. Interferon is a nonnucleoside transcription inhibitor. Ribavirin inhibits RNA polymerase activity, thereby inhibiting the initiation and synthesis of RNA fragments. Patients with hepatitis C genotype 1 may also benefit from the addition of a protease inhibitor (telaprevir or bocepravir), which are inhibitors of the nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) complex to inhibit replication of the hepatitis C virus. Telapravir can inhibit this complex in other hepatitis C genotypes, but bocepravir specifically acts on hepatitis C genotype 1. Protease inhibitors are not recommended for genotypes 2, 3. and 4.\n\n【30】Interferon is associated with significant adverse effects, including fatigue, arthralgias, depression, and suicidality.\n\n【31】##### Structure\n\n【32】Valacyclovir, famciclovir, and valganciclovir: Ester prodrugs of, respectively, acyclovir, penciclovir, and ganciclovir.\n\n【33】Cidofovir: Phosphonate analog of cytidine.\n\n【34】Idoxuridine, stavudine, zidovudine: Analog of thymidine.\n\n【35】Lamivudine: Analog of cytosine.\n\n【36】Abacavir: Analog of guanosine.\n\n【37】Didanosine: analog of adenosine\n\n【38】Table 47–2 presents a partial listing of antiviral agents and mechanisms of action, and Table 47–3 presents the agents used to treat herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, and cytomegalovirus.\n删除4：<u>Table 47–2 • PARTIAL LISTING OF ANTIVIRAL AGENTS AND MECHANISMS OF ACTION</u>\n删除4：<u>Table 47–3 • AGENTS USED TO TREAT HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS, VARICELLA-ZOSTER VIRUS, AND CYTOMEGALOVIRUS (ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION)</u>\n\n【39】##### Mechanism of Action\n\n【40】Valacyclovir, ganciclovir, and valganciclovir act like acyclovir.\n\n【41】Idoxuridine and famciclovir and the prodrug famciclovir, which is converted to the active agent penciclovir, also act like acyclovir except that they do not cause DNA chain termination.\n\n【42】Trifluridine (activated by host cell phosphorylation) and foscarnet (acts directly to inhibit viral DNA polymerase and RNA polymerase) do not require activation by viral thymidine kinase for their activity and therefore can be used to treat acyclovir-resistant viral infections.\n\n【43】Cidofovir is phosphorylated to mono- and diphosphate nucleotides by cellular kinases and, therefore, accumulates in both infected and uninfected cells. As a diphosphate, cidofovir inhibits and serves as an alternative dCTP substrate for viral DNA polymerase, resulting in inhibition of viral DNA synthesis and termination of chain elongation.\n\n【44】Fomivirsen is an antisense oligonucleotide that binds to the major immediate early region 2 (IE <sub>2 </sub> ) of cytomegalovirus mRNA to prevent its translation to protein and therefore to block viral replication.\n\n【45】Neverapine, efavirenz, and delavirdine bind to reverse trancriptase to inhibit its activity.\n\n【46】##### Administration\n\n【47】Acyclovir: Administered IV and orally and is used as a topical agent.\n\n【48】Foscarnet: Reserved to treat acyclovir-resistant viral infections and can only be administered IV.\n\n【49】Valacyclovir, famciclovir: Available only for oral use.\n\n【50】Ganciclovir: Administered orally; parenterally (IV); and as an intraocular, slow-release implant.\n\n【51】Penciclovir, trifluridine, idoxuridine: Available only for topical use.\n\n【52】Cidofovir: Administered parenterally with probenecid to block its active tubular secretion.\n\n【53】Fomivirsen: Administered by intravitreal injection.\n\n【54】##### Pharmacokinetics\n\n【55】Acyclovir: Low oral bioavailability.\n\n【56】Vlacyclovir: An ester prodrug with greater oral bioavailability than acyclovir that is rapidly and completely converted to acyclovir after absorption.\n\n【57】Famciclovir, valganciclovir: Ester prodrugs that are rapidly converted by first-pass metabolism to their respective active agents, penciclovir and ganciclovir.\n\n【58】NNRTI and PI agents are metabolized by and induce the cypP450 enzyme system (3A4), resulting in numerous drug-drug interactions.\n\n【59】####", "index": 10226, "show": true, "start": 10226, "end": 10429, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/09/14 13:49:30", "endTime": "2024/09/14 13:50:04", "cost": 33.884}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:00", "update_time": "2024-09-13 21:50:04", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 21:49:30"}

What are the treatment options?\n\n【7】Answer 85\n\n【8】i. Angiokeratomas are vascular lesions that result from the dilation of superficial vessels. They are usually well-circumscribed and can have variable levels of hyperkeratosis. There are five variants of angiokeratomas: solitary or multiple angiokeratomas, angiokeratomas of the scrotum or vulva (also known as angiokeratoma of Fordyce), angiokeratoma corporis diffusum, angiokeratoma of Mibelli and angiokeratoma circumscriptum. This patient presents with angiokeratoma circumscriptum, which typically develops in infancy or childhood and favours the trunk, arms or legs in a unilateral distribution. This variant differs from the other types of angiokeratomas because it can be the result of a lymphatic capillary or capillary malformation, whereas all other variants of angiokeratomas represent an ectatic dilation of pre-existing vessels in the papillary dermis.\n\n【9】Solitary or multiple angiokeratomas present as small, warty, black papules that favour the lower extremities but can occur anywhere on the body. Clinically, they can be confused with melanoma due to the dark colour. Angiokeratomas of Fordyce are characterized by multiple red, purple or black papules arising along superficial vessels on the vulva or scrotum. These are typically seen in older age groups, but can be observed as early as the second decade. Vulvar lesions are associated with oral contraceptive use and increased venous pressure during pregnancy. Angiokeratoma corporis diffusum is characterized by the development of multiple angiokeratomas on the body, often in a bathing suit distribution. Angiokeratomas of Mibelli usually occur on the dorsal and lateral aspects of the hands and feet, and are associated with chilblains and acrocyanosis.\n\n【10】ii. Angiokeratoma corporis diffusum usually develops during late childhood or adolescence and presents as clusters of angiokeratomas on the trunk and bathing suit distribution. It can be linked with multiple inherited metabolic disorders but is most commonly associated with Fabry disease, an X-linked recessive disease caused by a deficiency in the lysosomal enzyme α-galactosidase A. Other associated disorders include aspartylglycosaminuria (deficiency in aspartylglycosaminidase), GM1 gangliosidosis (deficiency in β-galactosidase), fucosidosis (deficiency in α-fucosidase) and sialidosis (deficiency in sialidase).\n\n【11】iii. Angiokeratomas are benign and do not require removal. However, if patients request removal for cosmetic purposes, surgical options include laser therapy, cryotherapy, electrocautery and excision, depending on the location and size of the lesions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:02:38", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:02:58", "cost": 20.406}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:00", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:02:56", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:02:35"}

The patient most likely has Graves disease-induced hyperthyroidism, the most prominent feature being the exophthalmos seen in the image. In addition, her fatigue, sweating, palpitations, and increased appetite are also symptoms of hyperthyroidism. She could be treated with an agent such as propylthiouracil at this point, which would help with the symptoms, although it will not reverse the eye changes. Unfortunately, it can have the adverse effect of agranulocytosis, and thus blood work needs to be done when first prescribing this agent to a patient. Agranulocytosis can lead to infection and may be life threatening.  \n\n【6】Answer A is incorrect . Folic acid is not used in the treatment of hyperthyroidism. It also does not cause agranulocytosis. It is often given to patients who are anemic. It is important that pregnant women receive adequate amounts of folic acid to reduce the incidence of neural tube defects.  \n\n【7】Answer B is incorrect . Levothyroxine is used to treat hypothyroidism and would be contraindicated in this patient as it would worsen her current symptoms.  \n\n【8】Answer C is incorrect . Propranolol is also used to treat hyperthyroidism. However, it is not associated with agranulocytosis. Its most common adverse effect is fatigue.  \n\n【9】Answer E is incorrect .

Painless rectal bleeding in an elderly individual (especially with a history of constipation or poor fiber intake) suggests diverticulosis, a condition in which the mucosa and submucosa herniate through the muscular layer of the GI tract (frequently along the sigmoid colon), forming pockets called diverticula. This patient’s lower left quadrant abdominal pain indicates that he is now suffering from acute diverticulitis, which is inflammation of one or more diverticula. The laboratory values show marked leukocytosis, which is actually a common finding in acute diverticulitis. More notably, the patient appears to have iron-deficient, microcytic anemia (low hemoglobin and low MCV) This could result from his past bleeding episodes; however, it could also be a sign of chronic occult bleeding from an undiagnosed carcinoma. After the patient is stabilized and the acute diverticulitis has resolved, the patient should undergo colonoscopy to rule out malignancy. Colonoscopy is contraindicated during an acute episode of diverticulitis due to increased risk of bowel perforation.  \n\n【13】Answer A is incorrect . An abdominal ultrasound can be quickly carried out in the emergency setting. It is helpful in the diagnosis of some genitourinary, gynecologic, and biliary pathologies as well as appendicitis. Its usefulness in diagnosing diverticulitis is limited. It has no role in screening for colon cancer.  \n\n【14】Answer C is incorrect . CT of the abdomen with infusion is useful in the diagnosis of acute diverticulitis. It may show the presence of diverticula and signs of adjacent inflammatory changes such as edema and fat stranding. Once the patient’s symptoms resolve, there is no need for a follow-up CT scan. This imaging modality has no role in screening for colon cancer.  \n\n【15】Answer D is incorrect . MRI of the abdomen is not useful in the diagnosis or management of diverticulitis. It has no role in screening for colon cancer.  \n\n【16】Answer E is incorrect . An upright abdominal x-ray is cheap and easily obtained.

The pain is aggravated when the thumb or wrist is moved  删除换行1: and when the man tries to grip objects. Radiographs are shown in Fig. 50.1.\n\n【6】删除3：<u>Figure 50.1 </u>\n\n【7】Questions\n\n【8】• What is the diagnosis?\n\n【9】• Describe any special clinical provocative tests.\n\n【10】• What are the anatomical features of this area, and its blood supply?\n\n【11】• How would you further investigate this patient to confirm the diagnosis?\n\n【12】• What complications can you predict?\n\n【13】ANSWER 50\n\n【14】The diagnosis is a scaphoid fracture. This diagnosis is more likely in the presence of  删除换行1: tenderness to palpation in the anatomical snuffbox and on the volar scaphoid tubercle. \n\n【15】A special provocative manoeuvre is known as the Watson (scaphoid shift) test. Place the  删除换行1: patients’ wrist into full ulna deviation and extension. Press the patient’s thumb with his  删除换行1: other hand and move the wrist into radial deviation and flexion. If the scaphoid and  删除换行1: lunate are unstable, the dorsal pole of the scaphoid subluxes over the dorsal rim of the  删除换行1: radius and the patient complains of pain – indicating a positive test.\n\n【16】The scaphoid is the most commonly fractured carpal bone, being involved in up to 75  删除换行1: per cent of all carpal fractures. Scaphoid waist fractures are the most common type  删除换行1: (65 per cent), followed by proximal pole fractures (30 per cent). Scaphoid fractures are  删除换行1: uncommon in children because the physis of the distal radius usually fails first. In elderly  删除换行1: patients, the distal radial metaphysis usually fails before the scaphoid can fracture.\n\n【17】The scaphoid is an irregularly shaped bone of which 80 per cent is covered by articular  删除换行1: cartilage. The scaphoid flexes with wrist flexion and radial deviation and it extends  删除换行1: during wrist extension and ulnar deviation. Anatomically, the scaphoid is divided into  删除换行1: proximal, middle (termed the waist) and distal thirds. Most of the blood supply to the  删除换行1: scaphoid enters distally. The proximal part of the scaphoid has no blood vessels entering  删除换行1: it, depending instead on vessels that pierce the mid-portion in a retrograde direction,  删除换行1: thereby placing the proximal pole at increased risk of avascular necrosis when fractured.\n\n【18】Scaphoid X-rays preferably include a posteroanterior (PA) view, a true lateral view, an  删除换行1: oblique view, and a PA ulnar-deviated view. The PA in ulnar deviation allows viewing  删除换行1: of the scaphoid in extension, while the lateral view allows an evaluation of instability. \n\n【19】When the scaphoid is destabilized via ligament disruption or fracture, the lunate and  删除换行1: triquetrum may excessively dorsiflex and yield a dorsal intercalary segment instability  删除换行1: (DISI) deformity. Occasionally, a fractured scaphoid is not visible on the initial radio删除8：<u>￾</u>graphs. In such cases, a repeat X-ray in 10–14 days may reveal a fracture line after some  删除换行1: resorption. If a diagnosis still cannot be confirmed with confidence on routine films, MRI \n\n【20】of the wrist is recommended. While CT scanning is useful in assessing union, fractures  删除换行1: with less than 1 mm of displacement are often not detected.\n\n【21】Non-union is not uncommon as a complication after scaphoid fractures because the blood  删除换行1: supply to this bone is poor. Smokers have a higher incidence of non-union. Occasionally,  删除换行1: the blood supply is poor enough to lead to avascular necrosis. If non-union is not  删除换行1: detected, subsequent arthritis in the wrist can develop. Imaging using a combination of  删除换行1: plain X-rays, MRI and/or CT can help confirm a non-union and avascular necrosis. If the  删除换行1: scaphoid fails to unite, consider a bone graft.

He noted heart rates in the 90s when he normally had been running in the low 50s. He was a competitive rower in college and cycled long distance, performing at least 20 century rides and multiple 200 miles rides. By September 2015, he noted more labored breathing with exertion but he was still able to cycle. He stopped his beta blocker due to insomnia side effect. He vacationed in a remote country in October 2015 and noted much worsening symptoms of shortness of breath. He was diagnosed with pulmonary embolism and was given tPA after echocardiogram showed PASP of 109 mmHg, (though CTA and VQ were not performed). He was hospitalized for 1 month and was ultimately anticoagulated with Eliquis.\n\n【19】Although his symptoms improved, he was not able to resume previous activities at the desired level. He still worked out 3 h a week for 25–30 min using the elliptical machine. On infrequent occasions when he did cycle, he could cover 2 h before experiencing fatigue. He did not note dyspnea. He coached his kid’s rugby and noticed that he can no longer sprint. He was felt to be WHO functional class I. He denied chest pain, lightheadedness, syncope, hemoptysis, lower extremity edema. He did note oxygen desaturation during exercise, going down to 89%. V/Q scan from July 5, 2016 and January 9, 2017 were essentially unchanged showing right upper lobe, lingula, questionable left lower lobe perfusion defects. Echocardiogram from August 12, 2016. showed normal RA, RV size and RV systolic function, normal LV size and systolic function, no evidence of pulmonary hypertension.\n\n【20】His past medical history was notable only for his pulmonary embolism as above and essential hypertension. There was a questionable history of left popliteal DVT 删除10：<u>(the patient reported pain and swelling in 2003)</u> for which he was treated for a short period with aspirin. Prior surgeries included a septoplasty 通用删除7(英):<u>(2011)</u>, left ACL reconstruction 通用删除7(英):<u>(2000)</u>, bilateral varicocelectomy 通用删除7(英):<u>(2007)</u> and a dermoid cyst removal as a child. On review of systems, the patient denied constitutional symptoms of fevers, chills, malaise, weight loss, weight gain, a known coagulopathy, connective tissue disease, Raynaud’s phenomena, previous exposure to stimulants, anorexiants, trauma.\n\n【21】Family history was remarkable for venous thromboembolism experienced by his father (PE), uncle, grand aunt (DVT).\n\n【22】With concerns over the persistent perfusion defects on VQ scan, and his dissatisfaction with his functional limitations, a referral was initiated to a CTEPH center specializing in thromboendarterectomy.\n\n【23】On exam, the patient was a muscular, well developed male, BP 131/89, HR 72 and room air O2 saturation of 99%. HEENT exam was unremarkable; there was no thyromegaly or jugular venous distension. Lung fields were clear with normal diaphragmatic excursion; no pulmonary flow murmurs. No palpable RV lift; S2 splitting with inspiration and no murmur or S3 gallop. No hepatomegaly. No lower extremity edema or venous stasis skin changes.\n\n【24】Laboratory data included a BUN 14, creatinine 1.40, liver transaminase levels within normal limits. ProBNP 13. Urinalysis negative for protein. White blood cell count 6.1, hemoglobin 15.2, hematocrit 45.7. Platelets 311,000. INR 1.0. PTT 38.2. EKG: normal sinus rhythm, 83 beats per minute. Normal QRS axis and R wave progression across the precordium. His echocardiogram 删除10：<u>(June 2017)</u> demonstrated normal LV size and function (estimated EF 69%); right atrium and right ventricular size were normal with normal RV systolic function, no tricuspid regurgitation, and no pericardial effusion.\n\n【25】On chest radiograph  there was no cardiomegaly or central PA enlargement. Lungs were well expanded without infiltrates.\n\n【26】删除3：<u>Figure 7.1\n\n【27】Chest radiograph at time of evaluation for thromboendarterectomy</u>\n\n【28】Lung scintigraphy  demonstrated large right upper lobe and lingular perfusion defects, with a smaller unmatched defect in the anterior right lower lobe.\n\n【29】删除3：<u>Figure 7.2\n\n【30】Lung scintigraphy demonstrating unmatched perfusion defects in both lungs</u>\n\n【31】Results of the right heart catheterization showed pulmonary hemodynamics at rest of right atrial mean of 6 mmHg, PA pressure 31/13 mmHg (20 mean), PAOP 10 mmHg, thermodilution cardiac output of 7.2 L/min (cardiac index 3.17 L/min/m <sup>2 </sup> ) and calculated PVR 112 dyn s/cm <sup>5 </sup> . Exertion of his upper extremities resulted in a PA pressure of 46/12 mmHg (28 mean), a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 12 mmHg, and a thermodilution cardiac output 13.6 L/min (cardiac index 5.99 L/min/m <sup>2 </sup> ); calculated PVR was 94 dyn s/cm <sup>5 </sup> .\n\n【32】Pulmonary angiography revealed evidence for chronic thromboembolic disease at the lobar level of a right upper lobe vessel and lingula .\n\n【33】删除3：<u>Figure 7.3\n\n【34】Digital subtraction pulmonary arteriogram: “pouch defect” proximal right upper lobe (open arrow), and occluded lingula (closed arrow)</u>\n\n【35】Though there was radiographic evidence for operable chronic thromboembolic disease, in the absence of significant exercise limitation and with essentially normal pulmonary hemodynamics at rest and during modest exertion, it was assessed that the risk of a surgical thromboendarterectomy was unwarranted and unlikely to result in a noticeable clinical benefit. However, to provide a more complete physiologic evaluation at higher levels of exercise, a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) was requested.\n\n【36】The patient exercised up to 271 W for a total exercise time of 11 min 1 s and was reported stopping because of dyspnea (3 out of 10) At rest, minute ventilation (VE) at rest was 13.5 L/min, maximum voluntary ventilation was 194 L/min, and resting oxygen saturation was 99% (pulse oximetry). The patient’s physiological dead space proportion (VD/VT) at rest, estimated from the transcutaneous PCO2 (PtcCO2) and exhaled PCO2 (PexCO2), was 0.31. Anaerobic threshold, based on the rates of change in VE/VO2, VE/VCO2 and R was reached at a VO2 of 1.692 L/min (16.6 mL/kg/min), 59% of predicted peak VO2. At the point of AT, the VE/VCO2 ratio was 28, the RQ was 0.95 and the heart rate was 139 BPM (81% of the predicted max). At peak exercise, VO2 (3.505 L/min, 34.4 mL/kg/min) was 123% of the predicted peak (2.856 L/min). The RQ was 1.15. The anaerobic reserve (peak-AT VO2) was 1.81, which was 63% of the predicted peak VO2. VE peak (100.8 L/min) reached 52% of the MVV measured just prior to exercise (194 L/min). The oxygen saturation during peak exercise was 92%, physiological VD/VT was 0.27, heart rate (179 BPM) was 104% of the predicted maximum heart rate and the BP was 144 mmHg/90 mmHg. The O2 pulse at peak exercise was 19.6 mL/beat mL/beat (438% of the O2 pulse at rest and 109% of the predicted maximum of 17.9 mL/beat). The O2 pulse increased continuously throughout the point when the patient reached anaerobic threshold and continued to increase even after the VO2 exceeded the predicted peak VO2. Summary of the CPET results:\n\n【37】   This was a maximal exercise test.\n\n【38】   The patient reached >100% of maximal predicted oxygen consumption, consistent with supra-normal aerobic exercise capacity.\n\n【39】   Normal cardiac response to exercise, with no evidence of impairment of heart rate or stroke volume reserve.\n\n【40】   There was no evidence of a ventilatory limitation.\n\n【41】   There was modest oxygen desaturation (nadir 92%), however, the SpO2 did not fall below 95% until a VO2 was twofold the value at the onset of anaerobic threshold and >100% of the maximal predicted VO2.\n\n【42】   The absence of significant ventilatory inefficiency at peak workload as well as the absolute fall in the VE/VCO2 throughout exercise is consistent with relatively normal pulmonary vascular recruitment with exertion.\n\n【43】Overall interpretation: The presence of a greater than normal aerobic exercise capacity, normal cardiac response to exercise, and absence of significant ventilatory inefficiency did not support the presence of objective exercise physiologic limitation on the basis of chronic thromboembolic disease.\n\n【44】Follow-up 12 months after the initial surgical evaluation revealed that the patient was engaged in high intensity exercise programs, experiencing an overall improvement in his athletic capabilities. His echocardiogram showed a normal sized right atrium and right ventricle, with normal RV wall thickness and normal RV systolic function; only trace tricuspid regurgitation. The findings on lung scintigraphy were unchanged.\n\n【45】Radiographic Interpretation\n---------------------------\n\n【46】The chest radiograph does not show any generic features of pulmonary hypertension such as cardiomegaly or proximal pulmonary artery dilatation. Allowing for the mild rotation, the lungs and pleural spaces are clear.\n\n【47】There are bilateral segmental mismatched perfusion defects on VQ scintigraphy with no significant change in the appearances over a 6-month period after commencement of anticoagulation. It is not surprising to see persistent scintigraphic perfusion defects following acute PE. Complete resolution may not be achieved for almost up to a year after the initial diagnosis. The reported residual obstruction rate on VQ after institution of anticoagulation is variable. A systemic analysis showed residual defects in more than 65% of patients at 3 months and 50% at 6 months after which thrombus resolution reaches a plateau phase (Nijkeuter et al.). A more recent study showed persistent defects in 30% of cases after 6 months of anticoagulation and was associated with higher incidence of symptoms, shorter distances covered in the 6MWT and higher systolic pulmonary artery pressure (Sanchez et al.). Since VQ cannot readily distinguish between acute PE and CTEPH, it is necessary to perform another test, usually CTPA to look for features of chronic thromboembolic disease. Another VQ pitfall is that the radiolabeled particles can potentially pass through partially obstructed vessels and hence perfusion defects can underestimate the severity of vascular obstruction and may not correlate with pulmonary vascular resistance or mean pulmonary artery pressure (Ryan et al.). Therefore, VQ cannot be relied upon in the evaluation of disease morphology and operability assessment.\n\n【48】Catheter pulmonary angiography shows limited proximal thromboembolic disease with a pouch defect in the origin of the right upper lobe branch and lobar lingular occlusion. There is also attenuation of anterior basal branch of the left lower lobe from mid segmental level. The remaining vessels are smooth with no intimal irregularity.\n\n【49】Clinical Comments\n-----------------\n\n【50】As noted by Dr. Gopalan, the presence of residual perfusion defects following an acute pulmonary embolic event, despite appropriate antithrombotic therapy, can be found in a considerable number of patients. If these perfusion defects are in the region of a previous acute thromboembolism, it likely reflects organized thrombotic residua, or in more contemporary terms, chronic thromboembolic disease (CTED). Recognized within the spectrum of the “ Post PE Syndrome ”, clinically relevant questions then need to address the extent of CTED present and whether it is accompanied by cardiopulmonary symptoms, or associated with pulmonary hemodynamic compromise .\n\n【51】删除3：<u>Figure 7.4\n\n【52】Post PE Syndrome : Klok et al. Blood Reviews 2014; 28:221</u>\n\n【53】It is also speculated that the presence of chronic thrombotic residua represents a precursor to CTEPH. There are several unresolved issues, however, including whether there’s a certain amount of CTED that will trigger the development of the secondary small vessel , the pathophysiologic mechanism responsible for this transition, and the time course for these changes to occur. As a result, the clinician is then faced with the difficult task of recommending a treatment plan for patients such as presented here. Though there was clearly operable chronic thromboembolic disease in this case, this was not enough to proceed with a thromboendarterectomy acknowledging that surgery is not risk free (Chap. 11 and Taboada et al.). And the “prevention of CTEPH” by removing the CTE lesions is speculative at best in the absence of a well-defined natural history of this problem. Typically, surgery has been advocated in this particular patient group if 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> they are symptomatic and are impaired from a functional status perspective, or 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> if significant physiologic derangement, such as elevated dead space ventilation or ventilatory inefficiency, can be documented. Essentially, if there a problem that can be fixed and result in a demonstrable improvement if a patient’s quality of life, an endarterectomy or perhaps balloon pulmonary angioplasty should be considered.\n\n【54】Point of Emphasis\n-----------------\n\n【55】The presence of chronic thromboembolic disease by itself does not necessarily warrant invasive intervention. The decision to proceed with surgery or balloon pulmonary angioplasty requires a careful assessment of the risks and anticipated benefits for the patient undergoing such aggressive treatment.\n\n【56】Diagnosis\n---------\n\n【57】1.  1.\n\n【58】    Chronic thromboembolic disease without pulmonary hypertension at rest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:14:25", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:15:07", "cost": 42.372}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:00", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:15:07", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:14:24"}

How will you determine this patient’s fitness for extubation? What are your goals for respiratory mechanics? What are your goals for oxygenation ? How will you assess his neurological exam? Is this possible in the setting of his acute intoxication? Would it be “safer” for him to remain intubated and sort things out later in the ICU?\n\n【3】Patient 2 . His liver laceration was repaired with good hemostasis and excellent surgical technique, and you administered 3 units of packed red blood cells without any additional products. He has 4 peripheral IVs and an arterial line and is hemodynamically stable with a heart rate of 62 and a blood pressure of 114/80. What are your plans for emergence? Should he go to the PACU? To the floor? Remain intubated? What are your indications for admission to the ICU for this patient? Patient 3 . You have decided to leave the patient intubated and admit her to the ICU because she is in fixation and had an altered mental status at the start of the case anyway, and you wish to keep her airway secured. The ICU calls 3 hours later wondering when she will wake up; they have not had to give her anything with regard to further sedation. Any concerns? How will you evaluate her prolonged sedation? Are there any medications you would administer as reversals, or does she need something else? Why?\n\n【4】Answers\n\n【5】Patient 1 . My initial assessment will be the patient’s mental status, to determine if he is easily arousable and responsive to commands. There can certainly be residual party drug or alcohol effects which will impair his mental status and potentially impair his ability to protect his airway. Surgically, it does not appear that he has any reason to require mechanical ventilation postoperatively, but if his ability to oxygenate is impaired as a result of fat embolism and he shows ineffective oxygenation, then he should be supported, at least overnight. Typical pulmonary mechanics at the end of surgery would be a forced vital capacity maneuver of 5–7 mL/kg and a negative inspiratory force of about 25 cm H2O, to command (to assess his ability to follow directions).\n\n【6】Patient 2 . The mental status following emergence is key in this patient as well. He is large, and a combative, dysphoric emergence will be dangerous for the patient as well as all surrounding personnel. That said, he might be fine because his most threatening problem, the liver laceration, was repaired. Depending on the need for postoperative immobility, and following discussion with the surgeon, I would be influenced by the need for perioperative sedation vs. extubation and careful monitoring on the floor. Of course, this is predicated on his ability to cooperate and self-report. If that is not possible, then he should go to the ICU, sedated with a protected airway, until he recovers from his acute intoxication. Patient 3 . This is a worrisome situation because part of the differential includes cerebral edema from hyponatremia superimposed on an altered sensorium due to the illicit drugs and a general anesthetic. She should have an immediate neurological exam including fundoscopic exam to evaluate her for papilledema, and an imaging study of the brain, preferably an MRI, should be emergently scheduled. Neurology consultation should be obtained, and if there is a question of any residual anesthetic medications that could be reversed, they should be naloxone for opioids, flumazenil for benzodiazepines, and physostigmine as a nonspecific central anticholinesterase.\n\n【7】Electrolytes and glucose should be immediately evaluated, and hyponatremia, which should have already been on its way to normalization because of the change in fluid management, should be re-evaluated.\n\n【8】Additional Topics\n-----------------\n\n【9】Questions\n\n【10】1.  1.\n\n【11】    What is the epidemiology of adolescent anorexia? What about this disorder is life-threatening? What role does the anesthesiologist play in the context of the physiological and emotional issues?\n\n【12】2.  2.\n\n【13】    Patients with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) can be on a variety of stimulants (Adderall® (amphetamine/dextroamphetamine), Ritalin® (methylphenidate), Concerta® (methylphenidate), Strattera® (atomoxetine), Vyvanse® (lisdexamfetamine)) for treatment. How do they work? Do you find this somewhat counterintuitive? Why/why not? What preoperative preparation does a patient on chronic stimulant therapy need prior to anesthesia and surgery? What are the concerns? Theoretical or real?\n\n【14】3.  3.\n\n【15】    A male adolescent rugby player, 92 kg, undergoes an ACL repair under general anesthesia with an LMA. Following removal of the LMA, he coughed and experienced an episode of laryngospasm which lasted about 30 seconds. After several minutes of emergence, his SpO2 remains around 90% with a simple face mask. What do you think is going on? How would you assess him further? Physical diagnosis? Chest X-ray? Arterial blood gas? What can you do to improve his current status?\n\n【16】Answers\n\n【17】1.  1.\n\n【18】    Anorexics die at a rate of 10–20% from complications of starvation or from suicide. All ages, races, and cultures are affected. About 15% of anorexics are men. The disorder is more about control and emotion than it is about food and many clinicians avoid probing medical questions during their preoperative evaluation of these often intelligent, organized, driven, and often “perfectionistic” patients, typically high-achieving female adolescent athletes such as gymnasts or dancers. These children often exist at the knee of the metabolic and electrolyte curve and deteriorate rapidly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. Their suicide rate is 57 times greater than a similar population. Sudden death has been related to ventricular tachyarrhythmias, QT prolongation, and torsade de pointes—all of which may be affected by the antidromotropic properties of volatile anesthetics. Hypokalemia due to vomiting, starvation, and the use of diuretics is common. It is particularly tempting to not order pre-op lab tests in athletic (albeit “thin”) adolescent patients who seem otherwise well. In a tipoff to a deeper underlying problem, these patients are often angry and defensive when you ask more probing questions and may refuse laboratory testing because they are well aware that abnormalities may accompany their underlying disorder.\n\n【19】2.  2.\n\n【20】    Stimulants , as a general category, increase endogenous levels of dopamine and norepinephrine in the central nervous system. The way this works for ADHD patients is that these increased levels of catecholamine neurotransmitters exert a “permissive” effect on cognition and particularly executive function. When levels of these neurotransmitters rise, children with ADHD no longer have to “self-stimulate.” Their efficacy is remarkable; about 2/3 to 3/4 of pediatric patients are significantly improved. Chronic stimulant medication does not seem to alter anesthetic requirements although there is some evidence that sedation may be more difficult and emergence may be hastened with methylphenidate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】3.  3.\n\n【22】    It is likely that in a muscular male adolescent (a very typical demographic), this represents negative pressure pulmonary edema, a result of forced inspiration against a closed glottis, the Muller maneuver. Because of the obstruction, a very large, negative, intrathoracic pressure is generated by the patient’s increased effort to breath. The large, negative pressures can be upward of −100 cmH2O. The negative pressure causes an increase in left ventricular preload and afterload and a decrease in extramural hydrostatic pressure. The right ventricle dilates, and the interventricular septum shifts to the left and results in left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. Pulmonary edema then develops. In the setting of the ongoing post-laryngospasm hypoxia , the pathognomonic sign by physical diagnosis is the presence of rales at the lung bases (often difficult to hear in a noisy operating room or PACU). Chest X-ray findings may lag behind the physical diagnosis findings, although by the time the chest X-ray is obtained, one can often see diffuse patchy haziness and frequently cephalization of flow in the pulmonary circulation. With this history and the accompanying physical findings, an arterial blood gas is not necessary for the diagnosis but may be a good idea as a baseline if advanced interventions are needed. At that point, I would place a high-flow non-rebreather mask on the patient and administer furosemide which will not only have a diuretic effect but will also directly decrease left ventricular diastolic pressure and mean pulmonary artery pressure, both unloading the right heart 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:23:41", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:23:51", "cost": 10.048}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:46:00", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:23:48", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:23:38"}

His blood pressure is normal, and his physical examination is significant for flank pain that comes in waves.

Calcium stones are the most common cause of kidney stones (80%-85%). Therefore, states that lead to increased calcium (such as hyperparathyroidism, or other destructive bone diseases) can lead to their formation. The stones are made of calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate, and are radiopaque; thus large, numerous stones would likely be seen on a plain film as well as noncontrast CT. Other risk factors are increased vitamin D and milk-alkali syndrome. Remember, parathyroid hormone (PTH) brings calcium from bones into the bloodstream. Calcitonin “tones down” the bloodstream (“channels”) of calcium and puts it on bone.  \n\n【7】Answer A is incorrect . Calcified arteries are unlikely to be mistaken for ureters, and a full rectum would not cause peristaltic pain.  \n\n【8】Answer B is incorrect . A large stool is unlikely to cause flank pain, and pain would not come in the waves of pain this patient is experiencing.  \n\n【9】Answer D is incorrect . Normally hyperuricemia leads to kidney stones that are radiolucent and therefore not seen on X-ray. They would, however, be seen on noncontrast CT. These stones are often seen in the setting of diseases with increased cell proliferation and turnover, such as leukemia and myeloproliferative disorders.

The medial malleolus (or deltoid liga-ment) is also disrupted. High fibular fractures (above the level of the syndes-mosis) define Weber C fractures. Weber B fractures occur at the level of the syndesmosis， and Weber A fractures occur below it.\n\n【19】12.2 B. A tear or rupture of the deltoid ligament would be of concern in this patient. The question tells you that the mortise is intact (clear space of 3.5mm) on x-ray； however， because the patient has tenderness over the medial malleolus， there must be concern for injury to the deltoid， which could result in an unstable ankle.\n\n【20】12.3D. Although all of the factors here may influence the decision to surgically reduce and fix an ankle fracture， the position of the talus in the mortise is the single most important factor.

Urinalysis is positive for WBCs. Physical examination reveals the boy’s urethral opening to be displaced to the ventral (inferior) aspect of the penis. Which of the following is the embryologic cause of this congenital abnormality?\n\n【1】> (A) Abnormal expansion of the ureteric bud\n\n【2】> (B) Abnormal positioning of genital tubercle\n\n【3】> (C) Failure of the mesonephric (wolffian) duct to regress\n\n【4】> (D) Incomplete fusion of urethral (urogenital) folds\n\n【5】> (E) Patency of the processus vaginalis\n\n【6】 Answer: The correct answer is D. This vignette describes a urinary tract infection in an infant with hypospadias, a congenital abnormality in which the urethra opens on the ventral (inferior) aspect of the penis. It occurs as a result of a failure of the urethral folds (also known as the urogenital folds) to fuse fully. Infants with hypospadias should undergo surgery to prevent urinary tract infections.  \n\n【7】Answer A is incorrect. The ureteric bud develops into the upper urinary system (collecting duct, calices, renal pelvis, and ureters) and is unrelated to the lower urinary system. Its abnormal expansion is not associated with known urogenital anomalies.  \n\n【8】Answer B is incorrect. Abnormal positioning of the genital tubercle may result in epispadias, a condition in which the urethral opening is located on the dorsal (superior) surface of the penis. This condition is less common than hypospadias and is associated with exstrophy of the urinary bladder.  \n\n【9】Answer C is incorrect. The mesonephric (wolffian) duct develops into the seminal vesicles, epididymis, ejaculatory duct, and ductus deferens in the male. Regression of this duct might lead to an absence of these reproductive structures rather than hypospadias.  \n\n【10】Answer E is incorrect. Patency of the processus vaginalis allows fluid to flow from the peritoneum into the tunica vaginalis, resulting in a hydrocele of the testes.

Review the components of a basic preoperative examination.\n\n【7】3\\. Understand which tests are required prior to surgery and why.The preoperative evaluation is a vital step that must be completed prior to the administration of anesthesia. It is performed to reduce the patient’s risk of mor-bidity and mortality when undergoing surgery， and to promote efficiency and reduce costs by minimizing delays and cancellations in the operating room on the day of surgery. 删除25：<u>通用删除1(英):<u>(Please see Table 9-1.)</u></u> In contrast to the history performed by a primary care provider during which chronic conditions are documented carefully， the anesthesia preoperative evaluation focuses on the current functional status of the patient and how their chronic diseases may limit the patient's functionality. For example， the relevance of this patient's arthritis to the anesthesiologist is mostly the impact on the patient's functional capacity and mobility， as well as any potential difficulties with the airway that may occur， as opposed to the long-term prognosis of a patient’s chronic condition. It is also important to determine whether the arthritis impairs the patient's ability to open his mouth or extend his neck， both of which are important to ensure a successful intubation.Table 9-1 THE GOALS OF PREOPERATIVE ASSESSMENT\n\n【8】1\\. To obtain a history of the patient's medical condition and relevant anesthesia history， and to complete a physical examination targeting the airway and relevant systems such as the cardiopulmonary status of the patient.\n\n【9】2\\. To recommend further testing or consultation as needed to optimize the patient for the anesthesia and surgery.\n\n【10】3\\. To obtain informed consent from the patient or health care proxy.\n\n【11】4\\. To allay anxiety and educate patients and their families about anesthesia.\n\n【12】5\\. To implement risk reduction strategies as appropriate.At a minimum， the patient's physical examination should include vital signs， height and weight， an airway examination， and auscultation of the heart and lungs. For the anesthesiologist， the airway examination is a vital component of the examination， for failure to secure an airway during the procedure may result in catastrophic consequences. The components of an airway examination include determining the Mallampati classification of the oral cavity 删除25：<u>(please see Case 10)</u>， the degree of neck flexion， head extension， thyromental distance， and dental status. Other factors such as body habitus and heavy facial hair may also affect the anesthesiologist's ability to mask and intubate the patient. If a difficult intubation is anticipated， the option of an awake fiberoptic intubation should be discussed with the patient. If applicable， other methods of anesthesia besides general anesthesia should also be considered at this time.Diagnostic tests can aid in the risk assessment for anesthesia and surgery， guide interventions to optimize medical conditions， and provide baseline results for perioperative management. However， screening tests can yield false positive results that may result in further morbidity in patients without a med-ical indication due to an unnecessary follow up. Pre-anesthetic testing should only be performed when indicated by the patient's underlying medical condi-tion. Indications for common tests are described in Table 9-2.\n\n| Table 9-2 PREOPERATIVE TESTING  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Hematocrit (Hct)  | Hct should be ordered if there is likelihood of unexpectedor symptomatic anemia， or significant blood loss is antici-pated. If significant blood loss is possible， a type and screenor crossmatch is also indicated.  |\n| Coagulation studies(PT， PTT，INR)  | Coagulation studies should be ordered if patient's historysuggests a coagulation disorder (such as hemophilia， vonWillebrand disease)， liver disease，malnutrition or malabsorp-tion， or if the patient is on anticoagulants.  |\n| Chemistries(electrolytes， BUN， creatinine，glucose)  | Chemistries should be ordered if patient has known kidneydisease， has risk factors for renal dysfunction (eg，age >55，diabetes， vascular disease， lupus)，is on diuretics， or will beexposed to radiographic dye. Liver function tests are generallynot required， although a low albumin has been associatedwith increased morbidity and mortality in ill patients，andmay be requested to establish a baseline.  |\n| ECG  | An electrocardiogram is one of the only tests that may beordered based on both the medical history and age. In gen-eral the incidence of cardiac disease rises steadily with ageand baseline.ECGs are often ordered for males over 45 yearsand females 55 years in age. An ECG should also be orderedfor patients with cardiac disease or symptoms of cardiacdisease.  |\n| Chest x-ray (CXR)  | Routine screening chest x-rays are not recommended beforesurgery. A CXR is only indicated in patients who have clinicalevidence of active pulmonary disease (eg，pneumonia，pul-monary edema， a mediastinal mass) or are undergoing anintrathoracic procedure.  |Cardiac complications are the most significant adverse events in the periop-erative period. The preoperative evaluation should be used to identify LIO11patients with modifiable conditions or those at a high risk for perioperative cardiac events. The guidelines for cardiac evaluation before non-cardiac sur-gery by the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association(ACC/AHA) are the national standards of care and are organized in a step-wise approach.\n\n【14】STEP 1. Determine the urgency of the proposed surgery. If the patient needs emergent surgery， the focus is on perioperative surveillance and risk reduction measures such as serial ECGs， cardiac enzymes， adequate pain control， and beta blockers to control heart rate.\n\n【15】STEP 2. Determine if the patient has an active cardiac condition such as an acute MI， unstable or severe angina， decompensated heart failure， severe valvular disease， or significant arrhythmias (eg， ventricular tachycardia and rapid atrial fibrillation). For these patients， surgery should be postponed except for life-saving emergencies.\n\n【16】STEP 3. Determine the severity of the proposed surgery. The ACC/AHA cat-egorizes surgical procedures into three categories： low-， intermediate-， and high risk. Low-risk surgeries include endoscopic procedures， breast and super ficial surgeries， and most ambulatory procedures. Intermediate-risk surgeries include most orthopedic and intraperitoneal surgeries. High-risk surgeries include aortic or vascular surgeries. Patients with no active cardiac conditions who need low-risk surgery do not need further cardiac testing.\n\n【17】STEP 4. Assess the patient’s functional capacity. A common way to assess a patient's functional status is by estimating a patient's exercise tolerance in metabolic equivalents or METs. Asymptomatic patients who have a func-tional status greater than 4 METs， which is roughly equivalent to walking up two flights of stairs， can proceed with surgery without any additional cardiac workup.To avoid the risk of pulmonary aspiration， patients should receive NPO instructions prior to the surgery. The ASA task force on preoperative fasting currently recommends a fasting of solids and nonhuman milk to exceed6 hours prior to any procedure requiring general anesthesia， regional anesthesia， or sedation/analgesia. Fasting rules have been liberalized at most centers to allow clear liquids (water， carbonated beverages， sports drinks， coffee or tea without milk) up to 2 hours before surgery in patients who are not at risk of delayed gastric emptying. To avoid confusion， patients should receive a writ-ten copy of all instructions. Some institutions may adhere to stricter guide-lines such as NPO after midnight except for sips of clear liquids when taking medications， or allowing clear liquids up to 4 hours before surgery for surgery scheduled late in the day.\n\n【18】For pediatric patients， clear liquids may be taken up to 2 hours before sur-gery. Breast milk is allowed until 4 hours before surgery； formula or nonhuman milk should be held for 6 hours preoperatively.1\\. Cardiac and antihypertensive medications： In general， all antihypertensive medications should be continued through the morning of surgery. Stopping beta blockers or alpha-2 agonists (clonidine) may result in rebound hyper-tension. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers have been associated with prolonged and resistant hypotension after induction of anesthesia. Currently， whether or not these drugs should be held prior to surgery is controversial within the anesthesiol-ogy community and practice varies widely. Diuretics can be held on the morning of surgery provided they have not been prescribed for congestive failure. Patients with cardiovascular disease taking statin drugs， beta block-ers， digoxin， antiarrhythmics， and antiplatelet agents should continue taking these medications because discontinuation can have detrimental effects.\n\n【19】2\\. Aspirin， antiplatelet agents such as clopidogrel， low-molecular-weight heparin， and warfarin： The decision to discontinue these medications， in general， depends on the surgeon's preference and the type of surgery. AnticoagulationWhenever a decision is made to hold these agents， it is important to carefully weigh the risks and potential benefits， and to involve the patient’s cardiologist or primary care physicians. There may be an increased risk of vascular events if chronic aspirin or antiplatelet medications are stopped perioperatively. In general， for high-risk patients such as those with cardiac or vascular disease， renal insufficiency， and diabetes， aspirin should not be stopped for procedures with minimal bleeding such as cataract surgery or endoscopies. If there is concern over significant blood loss such as may occur in intracranial surgery， stopping aspirin for 3 to 4 days prior to sur-gery should be sufficient.\n\n【20】For patients with recently placed coronary stents (<1 year)， aspirin and clopidogrel should not be stopped unless absolutely contraindicated， and then， only with the coordination of the patient's cardiologist. Premature discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy may result in stent thrombosis，MI， and/or death. If a patient can stop warfarin safely， it should be held for at least four doses to allow the INR (international normalized ratio) to nor-malize (<1.5). If the INR remains elevated on the day of surgery， fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K can be given to reverse anticoagulation. Low-molecular-weight heparin should be held for at least 12 to 24 hours before surgery or neuraxial anesthesia to minimize the risk of surgical bleeding and epidural or spinal hematomas.\n\n【21】3\\. Antiseizure， antipsychotics， narcotics， and medications for asthma and heartburn should be continued on the day of surgery.\n\n【22】4\\. Herbs and non-vitamin supplements should be stopped 1 week prior to sur-gery since they may interact with perioperative medications and some may cause increased risk of bleeding.After the patient has been fully evaluated， the anesthesiologist assigns a physical status to the patient based on his or her medical condition. The American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) Physical Status Classification System ranks patients for risk of adverse events during a surgical procedure.  This assignment is based on the physical condition of the patient， and is inde-pendent of the surgical procedure. The grading system ranks patients from ASA 1， denoting a normal and healthy patient， to ASA 5， signifying a mori-bund patient who is not expectedto survive without the operation. Intraoperative adverse events are encountered more frequently in patients with a poor physical status， greater or equal to ASA 3， especially in emergency situations. Some examples of patients that have a poor physical status who are at high risk for anesthesia and surgery include patients with active heart dis-ease (CHF aortic stenosis)， chronic renal disease， end-stage liver disease， and patients scheduled for surgery who are already in the intensive care unit.\n\n| Table 9-3 ASA PHYSICAL STATUS CLASSIFICATION  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ASA1  | Normal healthy patient  |\n| ASA 2  | Patients with mild systemic disease with no functional limitations  |\n| ASA3  | Patients with systemic disease with functional limitations  |\n| ASA4  | Patients with severe systemic disease that is a constant threat to life  |\n| ASA5  | Moribund patients who are not expected to survive without intervention.  |\n| “E”  | The suffix\"E\"is attached to the ASA classification for all emergent procedures，that is， ASA 3E  |In summary， the preoperative evaluation consists of a history， physical examination， relevant laboratory tests， and consultations which allow the anesthesiologist to assess the patient's physical status and optimize his or her medical condition preoperatively. Using this information， an appropriate anesthetic plan is formed by the anesthesiologist， the patient is educated about anesthesia， and informed consent is obtained. Successful preoperative assessment and management of the patient in the preoperative period may result in decreased perioperative morbidity and mortality， as well as an improved efficiency in the operating room.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:50:12", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:50:32", "cost": 19.62}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:45:59", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:50:32", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:50:12"}

Her veterinarian referred her to an exotic animal veterinary specialist who obtained blood for a complete blood count and diagnostic profile  as well as whole body radiographs . It was noted that the captive husbandry had been subopti-mal, with a diet rich in vegetable proteins instead of the roughage necessary to maintain urinary and gastrointestinal tract health in a desert tortoise. It was also noted that on physical examination the tortoise had a moderate hyperkeratosis of the dorsal aspect of the nose and malocclusion, which the owner reported had remained unchanged over the past several years. A large (3–4 cm) cystic calculus in the \"left outpouching\" of the urinary bladder and diffuse distention of bowel loops filled with fecal material was diagnosed based on radiographs; however, the following morning no urinary calculus was found on repeat radiographic evaluation . According to the medical record, it was suspected that \"the urinary calculus broke up overnight in the hospital, making it no longer radiographically visible\" on the repeat radiograph and a diagnosis of spontaneous resolution of urinary calculus was made. A pharyngostomy tube was inserted and the owner was instructed to feed 55 mL of a commercial critical care formula for herbivores once daily. Cisapride (2 mg/kg given orally daily for 7 days) was also prescribed to potentially increase gastrointestinal motility. At that time, it was suspected that the tortoise's anorexia, lethargy, and constipation were secondary to the urinary calculus that was caused by the owner feeding a large amount of high-protein vegetables that included leafy greens and squash. It was recommended that the owner change the tortoise's diet to a high-fiber, low-protein diet, such as dried grass hay, while reserving leafy greens and other vegetables for occasional \"treats.\" During the following 2 weeks, the tortoise was treated with warm water soaks, physical therapy, mineral oil, enemas, nutritional support, and acupuncture therapy for gastrointestinal hypomotility. During that period, 10 inches of feces was removed during an enema and the tortoise defecated a small amount on his own, 3 days later. The tortoise also appeared more active outside and began to eat grass and dandelions enthusiastically. The pharyngostomy tube was removed because the client felt that it may be interfering with the tortoise's ability to swallow; however, during the following 2 days the tortoise again became anorectic and lethargic.﻿\n\n【6】Physical Examination\n\n【7】On presentation, the 6.0 kg tortoise appeared alert and responsive, but was lethargic and had an extensive history of constipation and partial anorexia. A blood sample was obtained for a complete blood count and diagnostic chemistry panel . Whole body radiographs were also obtained .﻿\n\n【8】Interpretive Discussion\n\n【9】The initial radiographs shown in Figs. 25.1a , 25.1b , and 25.2 reveal a marked amount of particulate matter within the gastrointestinal tract. The ovoid opacity within the lateral mid left side of the coelomic cavity originally identified as a cystic calculus likely represents an end-on intestinal structure based on appearance and location. The remainder of the examination is within normal limits. These findings represent ileus.\n\n【10】删除3：<u>Fig. 25.1 . (a) The initial dorsoventral radiograph of the tortoise. (b) The initial lateral radiograph of the tortoise (top). The initial craniocaudal (anterior-posterior) radiograph of the tortoise (bottom).</u>\n\n【11】The dorsoventral view of the radiographs taken the following day  indicated the ovoid opacity overlying the lateral mid left side of the coelomic cav-ity is no longer identified. The granular material seen throughout the bowel persists and is unchanged. There is slightly less air within the loop of bowel in the cranial left side of the coelomic cavity than on the prior examination. The bowel pattern is otherwise unchanged. The round structure superimposed over the mid left side of the coelomic cavity on the previous study simply may have been due to superimposition of normal soft tissue and bony structures. There is persistent evidence for a generalized adynamic ileus of the bowel.\n\n【12】删除3：<u>Fig. 25.2 . The dorsoventral radiograph of the tortoise the following day.</u>\n\n【13】The radiographs taken on the day of presentation  revealed similar findings to the previous radiographs. There is granular material seen throughout the bowel. There is more air within the bowel loops than noted previously. This represents persistent evidence for a generalized adynamic ileus of the bowel.\n\n【14】The hemogram on day 1 indicates a leukopenia with a relative heterophilia, lymphopenia, and monocytosis, according to published reference values. The apparent reduced number of thrombocytes on the blood film suggests a thrombocytopenia. These findings are suggestive of either a stress response or mild inflammatory response.\n\n【15】The plasma biochemistry profile on day 1 indicates a mild hyperglycemia, which could be associated with a stress response. There is also a decrease in urea nitrogen, total protein, phosphorus, sodium, chloride, and cholesterol that are likely a result of the prolonged anorexia. The mild hypercalcemia is unexpected and may not be significant. The hyperkalemia may reflect an acidosis (likely a respiratory acidosis owing to an apparent normal bicarbonate concentration) or decrease urinary excretion of potassium.\n删除4：<u>Table 25.1 . Hematology findings.\n</u>\nThe hemogram on day 21 indicates a marked decrease in the hematology parameters. Likewise, the plasma biochemistry profile shows a marked decrease in all analytes except sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, and osmolality. These findings indicated significant lymphatic fluid contamination of the blood sample. Sodium, chloride, and osmolality are likely not affected owing to the likelihood that these analytes are equivalent in plasma and lymphatic fluid. Lymphatic contamination of blood samples are a common occurrence when sampling blood from chelonians. When this happens, the results of the blood profile should be ignored.\n\n【16】删除3：<u>Figure 25.4 reveals six leukocytes in this 50x magnification, suggesting an increase in the total leukocyte count.

(a and b) Blood films (Wright–Giemsa stain, 100x).</u>\n\n【24】Atropine (0.12 mg) and butorphanol (3.0 mg) were given intramuscularly as preanesthetic agents. One hour later, the tortoise was intubated (3.0 mm endotracheal tube) and induced and maintained on isoflurane gas anesthesia (3.5–4.0%). During the anesthesia, the tortoise was given 175 mL of a nonlactated crystalloid solution via jugular catheter.\n\n【25】Surgical exploration of the coelomic cavity began with the removal of a 6 cm x 4 cm block of plastron using a sagittal saw. The muscle below the plastron was dissected using a periosteal elevator. On entering the coelomic cavity, there were fibrinous debris, yellow tinged fluid, and multiple adhesions present. The fluid was evacuated with suction, and a large amount of fib-rinous debris was scooped out with a spoon. A culture of the fibrinous material was collected. The liver, stomach, and intestines were all visualized. The liver was enlarged with an accentuated lobular pattern. Fluid was present on the cut surface of the liver when a biopsy and culture were obtained. The stomach contained feed material and multiple loops of intestines were empty on palpation. Motility of the intestines was not visualized. The coelomic cavity was flushed with 2 liters of saline. The coelomic lining was closed using 4-0 nonabsorbable suture in a horizontal mattress continuous pattern. The plastron was replaced in its normal position and a fiberglass mesh sealed with epoxy was used to fix it in place .\n\n【26】The exploratory surgery revealed a severe coelomi-tis, resulting in a large amount of fibrinous exudate surrounding the internal organs, especially the liver and stomach. No cause of the exudate, such as gastrointestinal leakage, was found during careful examination of the tortoise's organs. Surprisingly, after receiving a large amount of food via the feeding tube and having relatively little fecal output, the stomach and the gastrointestinal tract were found to be relatively empty. The liver appeared diffusely yellow and greasy, suggestive of hepatic lipidosis. A liver biopsy was obtained after the exudate and adhesions were removed. Culture of the exudative material and the liver biopsy were submitted. A pharyngostomy tube was reinserted before the tortoise recovered from anesthesia.\n\n【27】删除3：<u>Fig. 25.6 . The postoperative appearance of the plastron repair.</u>\n\n【28】The tortoise made an unremarkable recovery from the anesthesia (3.5 hours) and surgery (1 hour and 22 minutes). The fibrinous coelomitis was likely the cause of the gastrointestinal hypomotility. The patient was given a guarded prognosis for recovery owing to the extent of the adhesions in the coelomic cavity, the apparent severe hepatic lipidosis, and the lack of an etiology for his condition. The patient was released to be managed at home with 20 mL of a commercial critical care formula for herbivores to be fed once daily through pharyngostomy tube, ceftazidime (20 mg/kg IM q 72 hours for seven treatments), enrofloxacin (5 mg/kg PO daily for 14 days), metoclopramide (5 mg/kg PO daily for 14 days), lactulose (0.5 mg/kg PO daily for 14 days), and S-adenosyl methionine (90 mg PO daily for 14 days). Daily warm water soaking was also recommended to keep the tortoise hydrated and to encourage gastrointestinal motility. The client was also encouraged to allow the tortoise to be outside along with the other healthy desert tortoise as he normally would be as much as possible.\n\n【29】Histologic examination indicated a suppurative hepatitis, hepatic lipidosis, and severe septic coelomitis. The culture results revealed a heavy growth of Pasterella testudinis from the coelomic cavity sample and Bac-teroides eggerthii from the coelomic cavity and a light growth from liver. These bacterial isolates were susceptible to all antibiotics tested including enrofloxacin and cephalothin.\n\n【30】The client reported that the tortoise remained lethargic, anorexic, and constipated during the first 2 weeks following the surgery. He passed a large amount of feces on the postoperative day 15, however, and became progressively more bright, alert, and mobile over the next several days. During this time, the tortoise began eating grass on his own and had daily defecations. The tortoise returned for a recheck examination on the postoperative day 21 and was found to be bright, alert, and responsive. Dried grass was present in his mouth, and his pharyn-gostomy tube was still in place. The plastronotomy site appeared clean and healthy, and several fecal samples provided by the owner appeared grossly normal. A complete blood count and a diagnostic chemistry panel were obtained . Whole body radiographs revealed no radiographic signs of ileus.\n\n【31】Eight months following surgery, the client reported that the tortoise has remained healthy and the surgery site continues to appear clean and healthy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:09:57", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:10:43", "cost": 46.269}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:45:59", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:10:43", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:09:57"}

During your preoperative assessment， a 72-year-old man complains of dyspnea on exertion and intermittent chest pain.

PatientsSwith aortic stenosis have decreased myocardial oxygen demand as the left ventricular hypertrophy offers a“protective”effect.\n\n【7】B.The increased pressure gradient between the left ventricle and aorta results in eccentric left ventricular hypertrophy.\n\n【8】C. Patients with aortic stenosis can develop impaired left ventricular filling because of diastolic dysfunction.\n\n【9】D. Myocardial ischemia in aortic stenosis is rare in the absence of coronary artery disease.\n\n【10】17.3. You will be taking care of a 72-year-old woman with a history of severe aortic stenosis (valve area 0.7 cm) for a laparoscopic cholecystec-tomy.

Administer an alpha-agonist drug such as phenylephrine.\n\n【17】B.Administer nitroglycerin.\n\n【18】C. Administer a beta agonist， such as dobutamine.\n\n【19】D. Administer an inotropic agent such as epinephrine.\n\n【20】ANSWERS\n\n【21】17.1. D. The murmur described is characteristic of aortic stenosis. The murmur of mitral stenosis is a mid-diastolic rumbling murmur， best heard at the apex with the patient in the left lateral position. The murmur of mitral regurgitation is typically a holosystolic murmur that may radiate to the axilla. The murmur associated with aortic regurgitation is a mid-systolic ejection murmur generally heard best at the base of the heart and is transmitted to the jugular notch.\n\n【22】17.2. C. The pathophysiology of aortic stenosis involves left ventricular out-flow obstruction with the subsequent development of a pressure gradi-ent between the left ventricle and the aorta. This results in concentric left ventricle hypertrophy rather than an eccentric hypertrophy. As a result of left ventricular hypertrophy， myocardial oxygen consumption is increased and patients can develop myocardial ischemia as a result of increased myocardial oxygen consumption and decreased myocar-dial oxygen supply. Also as a result of left ventricular hypertrophy， ven-tricular relaxation and filling during diastole is impaired.\n\n【23】17.3. B. The hemodynamic goals for patients with aortic stenosis include maintenance of preload， systemic vascular resistance， contractility， and a sinus rhythm， as well as the avoidance of tachycardia. Because of their relatively fixed stroke volume， patients with aortic stenosis are dependent on adequate filling/preload. Tachycardia and rhythms other than sinus rhythm (ie， atrial fibrillation) are poorly tolerated and can be harmful. Patients with aortic stenosis have a fixed resistance at the 删除换行1: level of the aortic valve； thus， maintenance of systemic vascular resist-ance is important to preserve diastolic coronary perfusion gradients. In patients with aortic stenosis， contractility should be preserved.\n\n【24】17.4. A. Hypotension is poorly tolerated in patients with severe aortic stenosis. Myocardial ischemia can develop rapidly； hence prompt recognition and treatment of hypotension is critical. In contrast to inotropic agents such as epinephrine or dobutamine， alpha agonists such as phenylephrine are generally regarded as the treatment of choice for hypotension， to restore coronary perfusion pressure.

Primary adrenal insufficiency occurs when the majority of the adrenal cortex is destroyed， result-ing in glucocorticoid deficiency， and， frequently， mineralocorticoid deficiency. Patients may present with either symptoms of the underlying systemic disorder or symptoms of adrenal insufficiency. Therapy is targeted toward treatment of adrenal insufficiency with glucocorticoid and mineralocor-ticoid therapy and treatment of the underlying sys-temic disorder.\n\n【2】The patient was a 47-year-old man who initially presented with fatigue， weakness， lightheadedness， and abdominal pain. A computed tomography(CT) scan of the abdomen revealed infiltration of perinephric space and adrenal glands . Because of ongoing symptoms， as well as imaging findings， the patient was referred to our institution for evaluation of the etiology of noted infiltrative process. On evaluation in our clinic， the patient continued to be troubled by fatigue and weakness， but also had night sweats and persistent abdominal pain. His physical examination was unrevealing. His comorbidities included diabetes mellitus type2 treated with metformin and hypertension treated with lisinopril.\n\n【3】INVESTIGATIONS\n\n【4】Workup for adrenal insufficiency was performed and confirmed primary adrenallinsufficiency.

In a study of 64 patients， endocrine manifestations included diabetes insipidus in 33%，ante-rior pituitary dysfunction in 91%， and primary hypo-gonadism in 53%. Although adrenal infiltration was demonstrated in 39% of the patients on CT， only one case of primary adrenal insufficiency was observed. Adrenal histiocytosis， along with other infiltrative pro-cesses， such as sarcoidosis， tuberculosis， histoplasmosis， cryptococcus infection， and adrenal metastases， should be suspected in any patient with primary adrenal insuf-ficiency and bilateral adrenal masses.2 The diagnosis of Erdheim-Chester disease involving the adrenal glands is usually made through adrenal biopsy3 Treatment of the underlying disorder depends on the etiology. Treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency is similar， with gluco-corticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement therapy Recovery from primary adrenal insufficiency is poorly investigated but is unlikely due to the irreversibility of the adrenal cortex destruction. Patients should be counseled on sick day rules and use of injectable glucocorticoid.\nTREATMENT\n\n【9】Hydrocortisone therapy was initiated， leading to improvement of fatigue and weakness. His electrolytes were normal， and he was not orthostatic； thus fludro-cortisone was not initiated. The patient was treated with cyclophosphamide and his disease was stable during the 9 months of available follow-up.\n\n【10】Key Points\n\n【11】●FErdheim-Chester disease is a rare non-Langer-hans cell histiocytosis characterized by infiltra-tion of histiocytes in multiple organs， including the adrenal and pituitary glands.\n\n【12】As pituitary infiltration in Erdheim-Chester is fre-quent， both secondary and primary adrenal insuf-ficiency may occur in patients with this form of histiocytosis.

Long-term ceftriaxone treatment slows the course of disease in mouse models of ALS caused by transgenic expression of mutant SOD. When administered at high doses at the onset of the disease， ceftriaxone pre-serves grip strength， slows weight loss and increased the overall duration of survival from 122 to 132 days.

In order to alleviate dis-tress before or during respiratory failure， which is usually the terminal event， narcotic drugs should not be withheld.\n\n【81】What is the rationale for using riluzole?\n\n【82】The suggestion that accumulation of toxic levels of glutamate at synapses may cause neuronal death through a calcium-dependent pathway. Rilu-zole has been shown to be useful in patients with disease of bulbar onset but not in those with disease of spinal onset. The risk of death or trache-ostomy is lower with 100 mg riluzole than placebo in limb or bulbar onset disease 删除10：<u>(Lancet 1996；347：1425-31)</u>， but it is debatable whether this trans-lates into an improved quality of life.\n\n【83】What is the role of beta-lactam antibiotics in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis?\n\n【84】More recently beta-lactam antibiotics have been shown to enhance astro-glial transport of glutamate in vitro by enhancing the surface expression of the glutamate transporter GLT1 and they do so at levels that are rou-tinely achieved during the treatmentof CNS infections 删除10：<u>(Nature 2005；433：73-7)</u>. Long-term ceftriaxone treatment slows the course of disease in mouse models of ALS caused by transgenic expression of mutant SOD. When administered at high doses at the onset of the disease， ceftriaxone pre-serves grip strength， slows weight loss and increased the overall duration of survival from 122 to 132 days. The slowing of motor neuron death is accompanied by a marked increase in the expression of GLT1 protein in the mice. The US National Institutes of Health has approved funding for a multicentre trial of ceftriaxone in patients with ALS.\n\n【85】What is the role of microglia in motor neuron disease?\n\n【86】Recent data suggest that the expression of mutant SOD1 in microglia accelerates the death of motor neurons in murine models of SOD1-linked ALS 删除10：<u>(Science 2006；312：1389-92)</u>. The aetiology may be toxin production or the transfer of toxins to nearby motor neurons or astrocytes by mutant microglia， or the mutant protein may damage the microglia and prevent them from producing protective factors. Other possibilities exist， including the production of diffusible toxins (such as ions or cytokines) by damaged microglia.\n\n【87】What is the course of palliative care in motor neuron disease?\n\n【88】1\\.

It is said to activate cortical motor neurons trans-synaptically through thalamocortical and cortico-cortical afferents， and allows detection of degeneration of cortical Betz cells. In patients with AML， the sensitivity of this technique to detect upper motor neuron involvement in those with clinical signs is high， but the sensitivity of the technique in those without clinical signs is unknown.\n\n【106】Is there any animal model for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis?\n\n【107】Transgenic mouse model possessing mutations in the gene encoding the cytosolic form of the enzyme copper-zinc SOD 删除10：<u>(Nature 1993；362：59)</u>.\n删除16：<u>Further reading\n\n【108】Radunovic A， Mitsumoto H， Leigh PN： Clinical care of patients with amyo-trophic lateral sclerosis， Lancet Neurol 6：913-925，2007.\n\n【109】Lou Gehrig， the American baseball player， died from AML 50 years ago.

A second-trimester ultrasound\n\n【4】D. A quantitative serum hCG level\n\n【5】Answer: 4.1 B . A first-trimester ultrasound is accurate to within ±1 week for gestational dating and would be the most accurate assessment of gestational age of the options listed.\n\n【6】Question: 4.2 A 38-year-old pregnant woman presents for initial visit at 12 weeks’ gestation. She requests a “genetic screen” because she is concerned about her advanced maternal age. She does not want any invasive testing that may cause a potential miscarriage. Which of the following is most appropriate to offer this patient?\n\n【7】A. If no prior personal or family history of genetic defects, no screen is needed.\n\n【8】B. Draw and send blood for the triple or quad screen, as patient has advanced maternal age.\n\n【9】C. Nuchal translucency screening and hCG and pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) testing.\n\n【10】D. Offer the patient chorionic villus sampling.\n\n【11】Answer: 4.2 C . In the 10 to 13 weeks’ gestational age, first-trimester trisomy screening may be performed by ultrasound looking at a echolucent area behind the fetal neck called the nuchal translucency. That measurement together with serum hCG and PAPP-A can give a risk for trisomy.\n\n【12】Question: 4.3 A 28-year-old woman with a history of epilepsy presents for a preconception consultation visit. Which of the following is the most important advice to give to this patient?\n\n【13】A. Diabetes screening prior to pregnancy.\n\n【14】B. EEG reading that is normal prior to conception.\n\n【15】C. Preconception folate supplementation.\n\n【16】D. Stop epilepsy medication prior to pregnancy and through the first trimester.\n\n【17】Answer: 4.3 C . Women with a history of epilepsy should receive 1 mg of folic acid supplementation daily to help prevent neural tube defects. In general epilepsy medications should be continued, although the type of medication may be changed. For instance, valproic acid has a relatively high rate of neural tube defects associated with its use, and if possible, another medication should be used.\n\n【18】Question: 4.4 A 28-year-old G1P0 woman at 16 weeks’ gestation is noted to be Rh negative. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step for this patient?\n\n【19】A. Administer RhoGAM at this time.\n\n【20】B. Check the patient’s antibody screen (indirect Coombs).\n\n【21】C. Schedule the patient for amniocentesis to assess for isoimmunization.\n\n【22】D. Counsel the patient to terminate the pregnancy.\nAnswer: 4.4 B . For women who are Rh negative, the next step is to assess the antibody screen or indirect Coombs test. If the antibody screen is negative, there is no isoimmunization, and RhoGAM is given at 28 weeks’ gestation and again at delivery if the baby is confirmed as Rh positive. The RhoGAM is given to prevent isoimmunization. If the antibody screen is positive and the identity of the antibody is confirmed as Rh (anti-D), then assessment of its titer will assist in knowing the probability of fetal effect. A low titer can be observed, whereas a high titer should initiate further testing such as ultrasound and possibly amniocentesis.\n\n【23】CLINICAL PEARLS\n\n【24】 The initial prenatal visit often is scheduled after fetal organogenesis has occurred. For this reason, a preconception visit can be very beneficial. Furthermore, when prescribing medications, physicians must consider the possibility that any woman of reproductive age may become pregnant.\n\n【25】 Genetic counseling should be offered to any woman who will be 35 years old or older at her estimated date of confinement (EDC).\n\n【26】 Folic acid supplementation is important for every woman, and the recommended daily dose is based on individual risk factors such as anticonvulsant therapy or a previous pregnancy with a neural tube defect.\n\n【27】 If all criteria are met, Naegele’s rule can be used to determine the EDC (subtract 3 months, add 7 days).

This had been present for 2 years on and  删除换行1: off. The pain settled for a period of 6 months, but it has returned over the last 10 months and  删除换行1: she is worried that the pain originates in her heart. The pain usually starts on the left side of  删除换行1: the chest, radiating to the left axilla. She describes it as a tight or gripping pain that lasts for  删除换行1: anything from 5 to 30 min at a time. It can come on at any time and is often related to exercise,  删除换行1: but it has occurred at rest, particularly in the evenings. The pain is usually associated with  删除换行1: shortness of breath. It makes her stop whatever she is doing, and she often feels faint or dizzy  删除换行1: with the pain. Occasionally palpitations come on after the start of the pain. Detailed question删除8：<u>￾</u>ing about the palpitations indicates that they are a sensation of a strong but steady heartbeat.\n\n【4】In her medical history, she had her appendix removed at the age of 15 years. At the age of 24  删除换行1: years she was investigated for an irregular bowel habit and abdominal pain, but no specific  删除换行1: diagnosis was reached. These symptoms still trouble her. She has seasonal rhinitis. Two years  删除换行1: ago she visited a chemist and had her cholesterol level measured; the result was 4.1mmol/L. \n\n【5】In her family history her grandfather died of a myocardial infarction, a year previously, aged  删除换行1: 77 years. Several members of her family have hay fever or asthma. She works as a medical  删除换行1: secretary. She is married and has no children.\n\n【6】Examination\n\n【7】On examination, she has a blood pressure of 102/65mmHg and pulse of 78/min, which is  删除换行1: regular. The heart sounds are normal. There is some tenderness on the left side of the chest,  删除换行1: to the left of the sternum and in the left submammary area. The respiratory rate is 22/min. \n\n【8】No abnormalities were found on examination of the lungs. She is tender in the left iliac fossa.\n\n【9】INVESTIGATIONS\n\n【10】•\t Her electrocardiogram (ECG) is shown in Figure 28.1.\n\n【11】•\t She asked to be referred for a coronary arteriogram to rule out significant coronary  删除换行1: artery disease.\n\n【12】Question\n\n【13】•\t What should be done?\n\n【14】I aVR V1 V4 删除换行1: aVR V2 V5 删除换行1: aVF V3 V6\n\n【15】II\n\n【16】III\n\n【17】V1\n\n【18】II\n\n【19】V删除换行4: ANSWER 28\n删除3：<u>Figure 28.1 Electrocardiogram.</u>\n\n【20】The ECG shown is normal. The pain does not have the characteristics of ischaemic heart  删除换行1: disease in that it has a variable relation to exercise, starts on the left side and lasts for up to 30  删除换行1: min. Based on the information given here it would be reasonable to explore her anxieties and  删除换行1: to reassure the patient that this is very unlikely to represent coronary artery disease and to  删除换行1: subsequently assess the effects of that reassurance. It may well be that she is anxious about the  删除换行1: death of her grandfather from ischaemic heart disease. He may have had symptoms before  删除换行1: his death that were related to her anxieties. From a risk point of view her grandfather’s death  删除换行1: at the age of 77 with no other affected relatives is not a relevant risk factor. She has expressed  删除换行1: anxiety already by having her cholesterol measured (and found to be normal).\n\n【21】She has a history that is suspicious of irritable bowel syndrome with persistent pain, irregular  删除换行1: bowel habit and normal investigations. Ischaemic chest pain is usually central and generally  删除换行1: reproducible with the same stimuli. The associated shortness of breath may reflect overventi删除8：<u>￾</u>lation coming on with the pain and giving her dizziness and palpitations.\n\n【22】The characteristics of the pain and associated shortness of breath should be explored fur删除8：<u>￾</u>ther. Asthma can sometimes be described as tightness or pain in the chest, and she has sea删除8：<u>￾</u>sonal rhinitis and a family history of asthma. Gastrointestinal causes of pain such as reflux  删除换行1: oesophagitis are unlikely in view of the site and relationship on occasions to exercise. The  删除换行1: length of the history excludes other causes of acute chest pain, such as pericarditis. Chronic  删除换行1: hyperventilation or psychogenic dyspnoea may be detected from a low PaCO2 often with  删除换行1: compensatory low bicarbonate level and an abnormal breathing pattern, often with sighing  删除换行1: breaths. However, it is important to remember that patients with psychogenic dyspnoea may  删除换行1: develop other medical problems.\n\n【23】The problem of embarking on tests is that there is no simple screening test that can defini删除8：<u>￾</u>tively rule out significant coronary artery disease. Too many investigations may reinforce her  删除换行1: belief in her illness, and false-positive findings do occur and may exacerbate her anxieties. \n\n【24】However, if the patient could not be simply reassured, it might be appropriate to proceed with  删除换行1: an exercise stress test or a thallium scan to look for areas of reversible ischaemia on exercise  删除换行1: or other stress. If this is normal she can then be reassured strongly with confidence. A coro删除8：<u>￾</u>nary arteriogram would not be appropriate without other information to indicate a higher  删除换行1: degree of risk of coronary artery disease.\n\n【25】KEY POINTS\n\n【26】•\t Ischaemic heart disease characteristically causes central rather than left-sided chest  删除换行1: pain.\n\n【27】•\t The resting ECG may show signs of ischaemia or previous infarction but is not a very  删除换行1: sensitive test for ischaemic heart disease.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:42:09", "endTime": "2024/09/14 14:14:54", "cost": 9165.053}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:45:59", "update_time": "2024-09-13 22:14:54", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:42:09"}

These symptoms have been  删除换行1: present on most days for a period greater than 6 months. These symptoms are constant and  删除换行1: not limited to specific situations like fear of being embarrassed in public (social phobia), fear  删除换行1: of heights (specific phobia), discrete periods (panic attacks), or related to obsessions (obses删除8：<u>￾</u>sive-compulsive disorder [OCD]) or to recollections of intense trauma (posttraumatic stress  删除换行1: disorder [PTSD]).\n\n【13】A detailed history and mental state examination are needed to rule out the differential diag删除8：<u>￾</u>noses listed above. Relevant blood tests like thyroid function tests, blood glucose and com删除8：<u>￾</u>plete blood count are needed to rule out the physical differentials. Additional tests can be  删除换行1: done in the context of other findings on history or examination.\n\n【14】Patients seen in early stages of GAD may respond to counselling offered in primary care. \n\n【15】Those with moderate to severe symptoms need cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), which  删除换行1: is the first-line treatment. Chronic or severe cases may need referral to psychiatric ser删除8：<u>￾</u>vices, as in the case of this patient. Anxiety management provided by a community men删除8：<u>￾</u>tal health nurse is often effective and no other treatment is needed. Selective serotonin  删除换行1: reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as fluoxetine, paroxetine or citalopram can be useful but  删除换行1: may cause paradoxical increase in agitation and reduce patients’ concordance with treat删除8：<u>￾</u>ment. Side effects should be monitored carefully. Benzodiazepines carry a risk of develop删除8：<u>￾</u>ing tolerance and dependence with continuous use and should only be used very rarely  删除换行1: and then for no more than 3 weeks.\n\n【16】Differential diagnoses\n\n【17】• Depression: Anxiety symptoms are common in depression and co-morbid depres删除8：<u>￾</u>sion is often seen with GAD. The type of symptom that appears first and is more  删除换行1: severe is conventionally considered to be primary.\n\n【18】• Panic disorder: There is a discrete episode of intense fear with sudden onset and a  删除换行1: subjective need to escape.\n\n【19】• Other anxiety disorders: They have the same core symptoms as in GAD but the  删除换行1: symptoms occur in specific situations as in phobic anxiety disorder, OCD or PTSD.\n\n【20】• Substance misuse: Symptoms of alcohol or drug withdrawal may mimic those of  删除换行1: anxiety.\n\n【21】• Physical illness: A host of medical conditions can mimic GAD – endocrine disorders  删除换行1: such as hyperthyroidism or phaeochromocytoma; neurological disorders such as  删除换行1: migraine; deficiency states such as anaemia or vitamin B12 deficiency; cardiac condi删除8：<u>￾</u>tions such as arrhythmias and mitral valve prolapse; and metabolic conditions such  删除换行1: as hypoglycaemia and porphyria.\n\n【22】Key Points\n\n【23】• GAD is characterized by a constant feeling of fear and insecurity.\n\n【24】• CBT is the treatment of choice.

He ignores his symptoms for another eight months, during which time they continue to worsen. He finally visits his physician at the urging of his wife. While shaking hands, his physician notices that the patient has clubbing of the fingers. A clinical work-up and medical history fail to find a cause for this restrictive lung disease.

Interstitial (or idiopathic) pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive fibrotic disorder of the lower respiratory tract that affects older adults. It is characterized by the abnormal proliferation of mesenchymal cells, disruption of collagen structures, and impaired gas exchange. The exact pathogenesis of IPF is still unknown. If not treated, IPF often results in death within five years. Lung transplantation is currently the only “cure” for this disease. On x-ray of the chest, IPF usually is seen best in the lower parts of both lungs as white lines in a netlike pattern.  \n\n【7】Answer A is incorrect. Albuterol is a β2 \\-adrenergic agonist used in treating patients with asthma. It is not a definitive therapy for IPF.  \n\n【8】Answer B is incorrect. Azathioprine may be useful in the treatment of IPF, but a patient’s pulmonary status will still deteriorate despite its use.  \n\n【9】Answer C is incorrect. Cyclosporine is an immunosuppressive drug most commonly used after transplantation. By inhibiting T-lymphocytes from producing interleukin-2 and other lymphokines, cyclosporine is able to reduce inflammation. Although it can be useful in the treatment of IPF, a patient’s pulmonary status often continues to deteriorate.  \n\n【10】Answer E is incorrect. Steroids may be useful in the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, but the patient’s pulmonary status generally continues to deteriorate despite their use.

Due to the progressive nature of HF and the frequent occurrence of acute exacerbations, a careful physical examination for HF signs should occur with each patient encounter. These physical examination skills, in addition to careful history taking, allow daily assessment of the hospitalized HF patient during an acute exacerbation but are also important for assessing changes during an outpatient visit. The physical examination may provide clues to the etiology of HF but for most patients determining the etiology also requires a careful history, an electrocardiogram, and blood testing along with additional studies such as echocardiography, coronary angiography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and other tests.\n\n【16】Depending on the level of severity, physical manifestations of HF may present in almost every organ system. For the purpose of this chapter, we have focused on physical examination findings and techniques that apply primarily to the evaluation of HF. The physical examination is especially helpful for assessing the severity of HF and the presence of congestion but some of the physical examination findings discussed below also suggest specific syndromes or etiologies.\n\n【17】In the following discussion, we review specific physical examination findings critical to the evaluation of HF and then discuss how to combine all the exam findings for an overall assessment.\n\n【18】4.2 General Inspection\n----------------------\n\n【19】General inspection rapidly provides important information about the HF patient including problems that may be caused by HF or may be exacerbating HF. General inspection includes inspection of the skin color and nail beds for evidence of cyanosis and/or clubbing, inspection of breathing, level of distress, and the overall nutritional status of the patient. Table 4.1 provides a summary of the key general inspection findings to look for in the HF patient. Is the patient “pink” or “blue?” A pink color of the lips, mucous membranes, fingers, and toes indicates that there is normal blood oxygenation. “Central cyanosis” occurs when the lips, mucous membranes, and extremities appear “blue” and implies hypoxemia. Central cyanosis is accompanied by peripheral cyanosis as all of the arterial blood is less than normally oxygenated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Peripheral cyanosis without central cyanosis may indicate severe peripheral vasoconstriction resulting in slow blood flow in the periphery allowing marked oxygen uptake and cyanosis in the periphery only. Pulmonary congestion due to HF does not usually cause hypoxemia unless there is an associated respiratory condition or there is severe pulmonary congestion. Clubbed nail beds may also be noted and indicate a chronic hypoxic condition which may be due to respiratory disease or a chronic right to left intracardiac shunt as most often occurs in congenital heart disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Clubbed nail beds are often red, sponge-like, and swollen. The usual concave angle between the nail bed and the nail becomes flat or convex so that the nails look like upside-down spoons.\nTable 4.1 删除换行 General inspection\n\n|  | Finding  | Suggests  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Skin color  | Central and peripheral cyanosis  | Hypoxemia  |\n|  | Peripheral cyanosis  | Low cardiac output and peripheral vasoconstriction  |\n|  | Pale skin—Best seen in conjunctivae, creases of palms  | Anemia  |\n|  | Jaundice  | Liver dysfunction  |\n| Nail beds  | Clubbing  | Chronic hypoxemia  |\n| Breathing  | Short of breath at rest  | Pulmonary congestion  |\n|  | Short of breath lying flat  | Pulmonary congestion  |\n|  | Short of breath bending over  | Pulmonary congestion  |\n|  | Short of breath walking into examining room  | Pulmonary congestion  |\n| Nutrition  | Evidence of cachexia  | Muscle loss included temporal and thenar muscle loss If due to heart failure indicates end-stage heart failure  |\n\n【21】As part of the inspection, the patient’s eyes should be evaluated for jaundice or “scleral icterus.” Scleral icterus begins to be noticeable when the bilirubin exceeds 3 mg/dL in adults. It is the conjunctivae that take on the yellow color, not the sclerae so this would be better termed “conjunctival icterus.” Jaundice may be caused by hepatic congestion due to HF but the presence of jaundice is unusual in HF unless there is severe right-sided HF. Thus the presence of jaundice in the patient with HF should stimulate consideration of other causes of jaundice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】Next is the evaluation of the patient’s breathing. Does the patient seem physically comfortable or is there evidence of respiratory distress? Is the patient short of breath at rest or with walking into the examining room? Is the patient able to lie flat without shortness of breath? Shortness of breath due to HF at rest indicates severe pulmonary congestion. If the patient cannot lie flat without shortness of breath (orthopnea) there is very likely an elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure causing pulmonary congestion.\n\n【23】Is the patient cachectic? Cachexia is defined by loss of body weight and muscle mass that is noted generally in all muscles but may be easiest to see muscle loss in temporal muscles, supraclavicular muscles, and interosseous muscles of the hands 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Cachexia may be caused by several medical problems other than HF such as cancer and severe lung disease. When cachexia is due to HF alone it indicates that the HF is severe 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】Is the patient alert and interacting normally? Severe HF may result in poor cerebral perfusion, especially in the upright position, but the relationship between cerebral blood flow, cardiac output, and cognitive dysfunction is complex and requires additional study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. If there is a significant change in mental status and the patient is confused or disoriented it may indicate a severe drop in cardiac output. Cardiogenic shock and other signs of poor perfusion (discussed below) should be immediately assessed. Depression is common in HF patients and a general assessment of mood and alertness may suggest a further evaluation for depression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. While a “flat affect” may be common in depression, the diagnosis of depression requires a careful history. Women with HF are more likely to have depression than their male counterparts. Interestingly, female caregivers of male HF patients are also more likely to suffer depression than male caregivers of female HF patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】Frailty is highly prevalent in HF patients occurring in as many as 50% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Frailty is “a syndrome characterized by an exaggerated decline in function and reserve in multiple physiological systems, resulting in a lower homeostatic tolerance of stressors and increased sensitivity and vulnerability to a wide range of adverse outcomes” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Although patients are often said to be “frail” by general inspection, general inspection is an insensitive method of detecting frailty. Frailty is most often evaluated in two ways—with the Fried criteria that consist of five criteria including historical features, gait speed, and handgrip strength, or with a general questionnaire that combines multiple comorbidities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Other frailty tests have been devised for specific situations. Many general inspection findings suggest frailty including loss of muscle mass (sarcopenia), slow gait speed, and difficulty getting up from a sitting position. However, it is important to understand that low body mass index and frailty are not synonymous, and frailty may be present even in obese HF patients. Recently, it has been reported that frail women are less likely to manifest muscle loss than frail men 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. As frailty is a sign of poor clinical outcomes including mortality, it will be important to utilize the physical examination as part of the assessment of whether treatment of HF results in improved frailty 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】4.3 Heart Rate and Rhythm, Blood Pressure, and Arterial Pulse\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【27】### 4.3.1 Heart Rate and Rhythm\n\n【28】Assessment of the heart rate (HR), the quality of the arterial pulse (AP), and blood pressure (BP) are all important in the assessment of HF patients. Bradycardia is generally defined as a HR <60 beats/min, while tachycardia is defined as an HR >100 beats per min (bpm), but changes between 60 and 100 bpm may also be important. For example, an outpatient whose resting HR is generally 70 bpm should be carefully evaluated (as discussed below) if the HR is 88 bpm. A rapid heart rate, or tachycardia, may be important for several reasons. A rapid HR may indicate an arrhythmia such as new atrial fibrillation or may be a sign of worsening HF because the increased HR is caused by sympathetic activation due to a low cardiac output or worsening pulmonary congestion or both. Finally, in a patient taking beta-blockers, a substantial increase in HR may indicate non-compliance with the beta-blockers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. In HF patients with sinus rhythm there is a direct correlation between higher heart rate and mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. Bradycardias may indicate an arrhythmia such as heart block or sick sinus syndrome that may exacerbate HF, especially if a new finding. However, a HR below 60 is not always abnormal.\n\n【29】Atrial fibrillation is a common cause of exacerbation of HF and the palpated pulse is usually “irregularly irregular.” Frequent premature atrial or ventricular beats may also be irregularly irregular so an irregularly irregular pulse is not diagnostic of atrial fibrillation. The assessment of HR may provide a clue to the cause of new or worsening HF—tachycardias with a rate >120 that have been present for several weeks may cause left ventricular dysfunction and a drop in ejection fraction—a condition termed “tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy.” New premature atrial beats, which may precede atrial fibrillation are often a sign of high intracardiac filling pressures or congestion.\n\n【30】When there is a rapid, irregularly irregular rhythm in atrial fibrillation the provider should be aware that the peripheral HR may not accurately reflect the actual number of ventricular contractions. With a rapid HR, the left ventricle may not have time to fill, if the beats that are very close together, and thus no peripheral pulse is noted for those beats. For example, the actual heart rate may be 140 but the peripheral pulse is 110. As the ventricular response to atrial fibrillation slows there is less and less discrepancy between the apical and peripheral pulses as there is more time for filling with each beat. Listening to the heart and palpating the peripheral pulse simultaneously will detect this situation.\n\n【31】A “regularly irregular” HR may also signal a hemodynamic diagnosis. For example, pulsus alternans describes the situation when every other heartbeat is not palpable or is markedly diminished 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. Pulsus alternans is detected by noting a palpable pulse on every other beat identified either with an electrocardiographic tracing or by cardiac auscultation. In patients with HF, the alternating pulse amplitude is due to alternating fluctuation of left ventricular contraction and is a sign of very severe HF and thus is a poor prognostic finding. Pulsus alternans is a rare but important examination finding and does have causes other than HF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>.\n\n【32】Pulsus paradoxus, described below, may also lead to intermittently palpable pulse creating the impression of an irregular HR. However, pulsus paradoxus is rarely detected by palpating the radial pulse as the pressure differences of 10–20 mmHg between beats are below most examiner’s detection abilities.\n\n【33】### 4.3.2 Blood Pressure\n\n【34】Blood pressure (BP) should be measured at each visit and at home if possible. Appropriate sphygmomanometer cuff size and patient positioning are simple, yet important for accurate blood pressure measurement. A larger size cuff is necessary to adequately assess BP in obese patients. Both the systolic and diastolic pressures are important as is the pulse pressure (systolic minus the diastolic BP). Systolic BP is often low in patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and may prevent up-titration of medical therapies that lower the BP. However, in the absence of dizziness or orthostatic dizziness a systolic BP of 90–100 mmHg may not preclude further therapy. A narrow pulse pressure (<30 mmHg) usually indicates a very low cardiac output and severe HF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. Another useful calculation from the BP is the proportional pulse pressure which is the pulse pressure divided by the systolic BP. A value <25% has good sensitivity and specificity for low cardiac output 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>.\n\n【35】In the initial evaluation, orthostatic BP should be measured especially in older patients. The most current consensus guidelines for the detection of orthostatic BP at home and in the clinic are outlined in Table 4.2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>. Orthostatic hypotension is defined as a reduction of at least 20 mmHg in systolic BP or 10 mmHg in diastolic BP within 3 min of standing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>. In the patient with supine hypertension (defined as a supine systolic blood pressure of >150 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure >90 mmHg), a 30 mmHg decrease in systolic blood pressure or 15-point fall in diastolic blood pressure has been suggested as the magnitude of blood pressure fall is dependent on the baseline blood pressure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>. Many medications for HF and other comorbidities cause hypotension and may exacerbate symptoms of orthostatic hypotension.\nTable 4.2 删除换行 Recommendations for determination or orthostatic hypotension in clinic and at home (modified from 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>)\n\n| In clinic  | At home  |\n| --- | --- |\n| BP/HR monitoring after 5 min supine Repeat BP/HR testing after 1 and 3 min of standing Alternate method : BP/HR monitoring after 5 min seated Repeat BP/HR testing after 1 and 3 min of standing  | BP/HR monitoring after 5 min supine or before arising in the AM Repeat BP/HR testing after 3 min of standing Repeat BP/HR testing while standing when symptomatic Check orthostatic vitals for 7 days prior to clinic appointment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>  |\n\n【37】BP blood pressure, HR heart rate\n\n【38】One unusual BP finding is that of pulsus paradoxus which is present when the systolic blood pressure drops by more than 10 mmHg with each inspiration. Pulsus paradoxus is rarely diagnosed with palpation of the peripheral pulse and is most often detected using changes in systolic blood pressure with inspiration. Pulsus paradoxus occurs when the heart is compressed, for example, by a pericardial effusion, and the blood flow increase into the right ventricle during inspiration limits the blood flow to the left ventricle as total intracardiac space is relatively fixed. Thus, the stroke volume decreases with inspiration and systolic BP drops with inspiration. The greater the intrapericardial pressure, the more left ventricular filling is limited and the greater the drop in stroke volume and systolic pressure. Pulsus paradoxus may also occur with severe respiratory distress due to underlying lung disease. Assessment for pulsus paradox should be done if the patient is acutely ill and a pericardial friction rub is heard or suspected.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:32:16", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:32:39", "cost": 23.166}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:45:59", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:32:39", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:32:15"}

The key differential  删除换行1: diagnoses therefore include: \n\n【11】•\t Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) \n\n【12】•\t Seronegative spondyloarthropathies (e.g. psoriatic arthritis, arthritis associated  删除换行1: with inflammatory bowel disease) \n\n【13】•\t Post-viral or post-infectious arthropathy \n\n【14】•\t Connective tissue diseases (such as lupus and scleroderma) \n\n【15】•\t Crystal arthropathy (gout and pseudogout) \n\n【16】• Degenerative joint disease (osteoarthritis) \n\n【17】The most likely diagnosis is RA, which is the most common inflammatory arthropathy and  删除换行1: typically affects adults between the ages of 30 and 50. This is because the history of bilateral  删除换行1: joint problems, mainly in the small joints of the hand, as well as morning stiffness lasting  删除换行1: longer than 1 hour, is very suggestive of an inflammatory rather than a degenerative process \n\n【18】(in the latter, symptoms tend to get worse throughout the day, and stiffness generally lasts less  删除换行1: than an hour). Similarly, the absence of any background medical history or other symptoms  删除换行1: makes seronegative arthritis, post-viral arthritis and connective tissue disease unlikely. \n\n【19】The diagnosis of RA requires the following, based on American College of Rheumatology/ \n\n【20】European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (ACR/EULAR) criteria: \n\n【21】•\t Inflammatory arthritis involving three or more joint areas \n\n【22】•\t Seropositivity for rheumatoid factor or anti–citrullinated protein (CCP) \n\n【23】•\t Elevated levels of inflammatory markers (ESR or CRP) \n\n【24】•\t Exclusion of other diseases such as crystal arthropathy, post-viral arthropathy, pso删除8：<u>￾</u>riatic arthritis and lupus \n\n【25】• Duration of symptoms lasting >6 weeks \n\n【26】This patient meets three of these criteria from history and examination alone, and refer删除8：<u>￾</u>ral to a rheumatology specialist would be warranted. Further investigations would include  删除换行1: basic blood tests (full blood count—possible anaemia of chronic disease, renal and hepatic  删除换行1: function—which may guide medication choice) and tests of inflammatory activity. The lat删除8：<u>￾</u>ter include CRP and ESR along with more specific tests for RA, namely rheumatoid factor  删除换行1: (RF) and anti-CCP antibodies. Anti-CCP has a similar sensitivity (65–85%) but much higher  删除换行1: specificity (>95% vs. 80%) for RA in patients with suspected rheumatic disease than RF, and  删除换行1: anti-CCP positivity is also associated with a more severe clinical course. Radiographs of the  删除换行1: hand would also be useful to look for evidence of joint damage. \n\n【27】The pathophysiology of RA is incompletely understood, and the cause remains unknown. \n\n【28】It is an autoimmune disease triggered by the exposure of a genetically susceptible individ删除8：<u>￾</u>ual to an as-yet unidentified antigen. Interplay of genetic (e.g. human leukocyte antigen  删除换行3: [HLA]-DR4 allele) and environmental (e.g. smoking, infection) factors lead to altered post删除8：<u>￾</u>transcriptional regulation of proteins and citrullination of self-proteins. Loss of tolerance to  删除换行1: these new epitopes leads to the formation of autoantibodies (e.g. anti-CCP) and the stimula删除8：<u>￾</u>tion of B-cell and CD4 T-cell responses, which act against unknown target antigens in joints  删除换行1: and mediate joint injury via production of inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis  删除换行1: factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin (IL)-1. These stimulate proliferation of synovial cells  删除换行1: and the production of matrix metalloproteinases, which assist in the destruction of articular  删除换行1: cartilage, and the inflammatory-rich hyperplastic synovium adheres to and grows over the  删除换行1: articular surfaces, forming pannus.

The physician calculates her body mass index to be 16.4 kg/m <sup class=\"calibre40\">2 </sup> . When the patient’s mother leaves the room for a moment, the patient admits to the physician that she has been feeling depressed recently and that for the past week she has been self-medicating with normal daily doses of one of her friend’s antidepressant medications.

This patient has physical signs consistent with anorexia nervosa, most notably a low body mass index, bradycardia, evidence of hypotension, lanugo, and concomitant depression. Anorexia nervosa is a serious condition that requires intensive mental health care, as well as close medical monitoring of weight, electrolyte levels, and hydration status. The mainstay of therapy is a combination of cognitive behavioral therapy and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Use of the antidepressant bupropion is contraindicated in patients with anorexia nervosa because it increases the risk of seizure in this population.  \n\n【7】Answer A is incorrect . Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). TCAs, although effective, are not first-line therapy in the management of anorexia nervosa, given the potential for cardiac adverse effects in anorexic patients already suffering from bradycardia and electrolyte abnormalities. TCAs are not known to increase the risk of seizure in anorexic patients.  \n\n【8】Answer C is incorrect . Fluoxetine is an SSRI most commonly used as an antidepressant. It has also been used to treat anorexia nervosa, although with questionable efficacy. SSRIs are not known to increase the risk of seizure in anorexic patients.  \n\n【9】Answer D is incorrect . Mirtazapine in an atypical antidepressant that induces weight gain, which may be beneficial in patients with weight control issues, although this has not yet been studied rigorously. Mirtazapine is not known to increase the risk of seizure in anorexic patients.  \n\n【10】Answer E is incorrect .

She began to notice brown spots on her cheeks a year ago but they have recently started to form into patches. The brown patches are not painful and do not itch, but they are not cosmetically appealing and have caused severe distress. She has a history of birth control pill use during her twenties and has two children. She noticed the brown spots worsening during pregnancy. She wears a moisturizer daily, but does not wear sunscreen. She is an avid gardener.\n\n【13】Physican Examination\n--------------------\n\n【14】There are scattered, hyperpigmented macules coalescing into reticular patches on her forehead, cheeks, nose, and upper lip .\n\n【15】删除3：<u>Figure 14.1\n\n【16】Centrofacial melasma. Brown, reticular patches are noted on the forehead, cheeks, upper lip, nose, and chin</u>\n\n【17】Differential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【18】The patient’s clinical presentation was most consistent with melasma. Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation may present with brown macules and associated erythema, scale, and pruritus secondary to photosensitivity reactions or irritant contact dermatitis. Solar lentigines are secondary to ultraviolet radiation and present as round, flat, well-circumscribed macules in sun exposed sites. Drug-induced photosensitivity due to thiazides or tetracyclines may present as irregularly shaped hyperpigmentation. Actinic lichen planus often presents on the temples and may involve the neck and intertriginous sites. Exogenous ochronosis presents with hyperpigmentation followed by progressive darkening with superimposed pigmented papules. Acquired bilateral nevus of Ota-like macules (Hori’s nevi) presents with multiple brown to gray to blue macules, primarily on the malar region. It is usually more common in Asian females 删除10：<u>(Chung 2008 )</u>.\n\n【19】Wood’s Lamp Examination\n-----------------------\n\n【20】Wood’s lamp examination (365 nm) shows accentuation or darkening of the hyperpigmented patches.\n\n【21】Histopathology\n--------------\n\n【22】Melasma is typically a clinical diagnosis; however, if a biopsy were performed, pathology would show epidermal melanin in basal and suprabasal keratinocytes. The number of melanocytes is not increased; however, the melanocytes that are present are larger, more dendritic, and more active. Inflammation is typically absent 删除10：<u>(Chung 2008 )</u>.\n\n【23】Diagnosis\n---------\n\n【24】Epidermal melasma\n\n【25】Case Treatment\n--------------\n\n【26】The likely etiology of melasma, including her oral contraceptive usage, pregnancy, and sun exposure was discussed. A triple combination compound consisting of hydroquinone 6 % + tretinoin 0.025 % + fluocinolone 0.01 % cream was started every other night to the dark areas only. The patient was recommended to increase the cream to nightly after 1 week if she had no burning or irritation. A broad spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 was recommended daily. Daily use of Polypodium leucotomos was recommended as a supplement. A 3 month follow-up was recommended. After mild improvement was seen, she was started on a series of three 35 % glycolic acid peels every 4 weeks in addition to her topical regimen.\n\n【27】Discussion\n----------\n\n【28】Melasma is a common acquired disorder of hyperpigmentation that is found mostly in Latina, Southeast Asian, and African American women with Fitzpatrick skin types III-V. Women are more prone to developing the disease than men, especially after the woman has experienced childbirth—leading to the common term, “the mask of pregnancy.” Melasma is worsened by excess exposure to the sun; therefore, it is more common in those living in areas with intense ultraviolet radiation exposure 删除10：<u>(Sheth and Pandya 2011a )</u>. A recent multicenter survey from nine countries found that 41 % of women had onset of the disorder after pregnancy but before menopause. Only 8 % noted spontaneous remission, and 25 % had onset after starting their contraceptive 删除10：<u>(Ortonne et al. 2009 )</u>.\n\n【29】The exact cause of melasma is unknown. The high incidence among family members suggest a genetic component, and various surveys from around the world report 10–70 % of family members being involved 删除10：<u>(Ortonne et al. 2009 )</u>. Sun exposure is likely an exacerbating factor because of the ultraviolet induced upregulation of melanocyte proliferation, migration, and melanogenesis 删除10：<u>(Sheth and Pandya 2011a )</u>. While melasma is known to occur with hormonal changes, clinical evidence to date does not clearly associate serum hormone levels to melasma. Perez et al examined the link between circulating hormones and found that nulligravid women with melasma had significantly higher serum levels of luteinizing hormone and lower levels of estradiol than their counterpart controls, though further research is needed 删除10：<u>(Perez et al. 1983 )</u>. Several studies have noted the onset of melasma with oral contraceptive use and pregnancy. Therefore, it is recommended that patients who develop melasma while taking an oral contraceptive should stop the medication and avoid future use of such drugs when possible 删除10：<u>(Sheth and Pandya 2011a )</u>. However, stopping the culprit oral contraceptive will not necessarily reverse melasma. Some studies have suggested that mild abnormalities in thyroid function are associated with oral contraceptive or pregnancy related melasma; therefore, it is reasonable to consider checking thyroid function tests in melasma patients 删除10：<u>(Lutfi et al. 1985 )</u>.\n\n【30】Melasma presents as symmetrically distributed hyperpigmented macules that coalesce into reticular patches. There are three distribution patterns. Centrofacial melasma, the most common pattern, involves the forehead, cheeks, upper lip, nose, and chin . The malar pattern is limited to the cheeks and the nose , and the mandibular pattern is specific to the jawline. Histologically, melasma may be divided into three subtypes. In epidermal melasma, melanin is increased in the epidermis, and patients present with tan to brown hyperpigmentation. In dermal melasma, melanin is found in superficial and mid dermal macrophages, which often congregate around small, dilated vessels, and patients present with a bluish discoloration . Dermal melasma is typically harder to treat. In mixed melasma, melanin is found in both the epidermis and the dermis. In most cases, the number of melanocytes is not increased, yet the melanocytes that are present are larger, more dendritic, and more active. Inflammation is sparse or absent 删除10：<u>(Kang et al. 2002 )</u>.\n\n【31】删除3：<u>Figure 14.2\n\n【32】Malar melasma. Brown, reticular patches are noted on the medial cheeks and nose</u>\n\n【33】删除3：<u>Figure 14.3\n\n【34】Dermal melasma. Brown-bluish discoloration is noted on the bilateral malar cheeks</u>\n\n【35】The excess melanin can be visually localized to the epidermis or the dermis by use of a Wood’s lamp. Epidermal pigment is enhanced during examination with a Wood’s light, whereas, dermal pigment is not. Lesions that have both enhancing and nonenhancing areas have a mixed pattern.\n\n【36】Treatment\n---------\n\n【37】Melasma is often difficult to treat and has a significant negative impact on patients’ quality of life. The ultimate goal of melasma management is to lighten the affected area enough so that it is even with the rest of the skin. This can be difficult when treating patients with skin of color.\n\n【38】First line therapy involves topical compounds that affect the pigment production pathway. Topical hydroquinone is the most common topical treatment used for melasma. Hydroquinone is a tyrosinase inhibitor, which primarily leads to decreased melanin production, along with altered melanosome formation and increased melanosome destruction 删除10：<u>(Jimbow et al. 1974 )</u>. Ennes et al found that 38 % of patients treated with 4 % hydroquinone cream once daily for 12 weeks had a complete clinical response compared to only 8 % in the placebo group 删除10：<u>(Ennes et al. 2000 )</u>. There is some controversy over the use of hydroquinone. Although rare in the United States, there have been several reports of exogenous ochronosis, a bluish-gray discoloration, after the use of hydroquinone cream, especially in South African blacks 删除10：<u>(Sheth and Pandya 2011b )</u>. One explanation for the high incidence in South Africans is that patients outside of the United States have uncontrolled access to over the counter high concentrations of hydroquinone 删除10：<u>(Olumide et al. 2008 )</u>, often mixed with topical steroids, and used for long periods of time\n\n【39】Topical tretinoin cream is also an effective treatment, but often causes irritation and usually requires months to show improvement as monotherapy. The combination of hydroquinone, a retinoid, and a topical steroid appear to be highly effective for the treatment of melasma, with the Kligman-Willis Formula – 5 % hydroquinone, 0.1 % tretinoin, 0.1 % dexamethasone, and a hydrophilic ointment being the originally studied combination 删除10：<u>(Kligman and Willis 1975 )</u>. The theory behind the effectiveness is that tretinoin prevents the oxidation of hydroquinone and improves epidermal penetration while the steroid reduces the irritation side effect of both. Side effects include erythema, desquamation, burning, and pruritus. Because irritation may lead to post inflammatory hyperpigmentation in patients with darker skin types, there are other topical agents that are available. These include azelaic acid, kojic acid, and ascorbic acid (vitamin C), all which may be less efficacious than hydroquinone but typically have less irritation.\n\n【40】Because ultraviolet and visible light can induce melanin formation, regular use of a broad spectrum sunscreen is effective both in preventing melasma and in enhancing the efficacy of other topical therapies once melasma has developed. It is recommended that all patients with melasma use a UVA and UVB protective sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 preferentially with a physical blocker, such as titanium dioxide or zinc oxide. Patients should also wear wide brimmed hats and protective clothing when outdoors. Many patients also use camouflage make-ups, with the most common brands being Dermablend (Vichy Laboratories, Paris, France), Covermark/CM Beauty (CM Beauty, Northvale, NJ), and Cover FX (Cover FX, Skin Care, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) 删除10：<u>(Sheth and Pandya 2011b )</u>.\n\n【41】Chemical peels can also improve melasma by removing unwanted melanin. However, they must be used with caution in skin of color, as they can cause irritation which can lead to postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. Glycolic acid peels are alpha hydroxyl acids that lead to epidermal remodeling, accelerated desquamation and pigment dispersion, along with inhibition of tyrosinase. When used in combination with a modified Kligman-Willis formula (5 % hydroquinone + 0.05 % tretinoin + 1 % hydrocortisone acetate), there was a decrease in the melasma area and severity index (MASI) by 79.9 % 删除10：<u>(Sarkar et al. 2002 )</u>. Salicylic acid peels, which are beta hydroxyl acids, have also been used for melasma, especially in Fitzpatrick skin types V and VI 删除10：<u>(Grimes 1999 )</u>.\n\n【42】The use of lasers have inconsistent results and is challenging because damage to surrounding tissue and subsequent inflammation can lead to postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. Fractional resurfacing is the only laser approved by the FDA for treatment of melasma.

These features raise the possibility of an underlying phaeochro删除8：<u>￾</u>mocytoma. Other diagnoses to consider are hyperthyroidism (may present with tremor  删除换行1: and weight loss but her TSH is normal), carcinoid syndrome (also episodic but presents  删除换行1: with intense flushing, associated diarrhoea and wheeze may be present), anxiety attacks  删除换行1: (diagnosis of exclusion), recreational drugs (amphetamines and cocaine can mimic the  删除换行1: features of an episode).\n\n【21】In phaeochromocytoma these symptoms are due to the episodic release of catecholamines  删除换行1: from the tumour. Phaeochromocytomas arise predominantly in the chromaffin cells of  删除换行1: the adrenal medulla. They produce adrenaline and noradrenaline. Other sites of tumours  删除换行1: include chromaffin cells of the autonomic nervous system (paragangliomas). The surge  删除换行1: in catecholamines released by these tumours gives rise to the episodic symptoms and  删除换行1: signs (headache, sweating, palipitations and pallor). Tumours are most often benign;  删除换行1: malignancy is more likely to occur in paragangliomas. Most cases are sporadic but up to  删除换行1: a quarter of cases are hereditary and occur in multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) types  删除换行1: 2A and 2B, von Hippel–Lindau disease and neurofibromatosis type 1.\n\n【22】Diagnosis is best made with a 24-hour urine collection for catecholamines and meta删除8：<u>￾</u>nephrines (the breakdown products of catecholamines), preferably just after an episode. \n\n【23】Serum metanephrines and normetanephrines can also be measured. If the urine or blood  删除换行1: test is positive, further investigation is required to identify the source. Imaging by MRI \n\n【24】or CT of the abdomen and pelvis will identify most phaeochromocytomas. However if  删除换行1: very small they can be missed. If the suspicion is high despite a negative CT or MRI,  删除换行1: iodine-131 MIGB (metaiodobenzylguanidine) scintigraphy can be performed. This will  删除换行1: detect a phaeochromocytoma anywhere and is 99 per cent specific.\n\n【25】She presents with hypertension and a headache. Initial assessment should begin with  删除换行1: determining any organ involvement that would necessitate immediate action to lower  删除换行1: the blood pressure. In cases of suspected phaeochromocytoma who are not in a hyper删除8：<u>￾</u>tensive emergency there are specific management considerations that differ from other  删除换行1: causes of severe or malignant hypertension. The treatment aim is to block the effects of  删除换行1: catecholamines on the heart and peripheral vasculature by blocking alpha- and beta删除8：<u>￾</u>receptors. The safest method is administering alpha-blockers first. The reason why beta删除8：<u>￾</u>blockers cannot be administered right away is that the alpha-receptors in the peripheral  删除换行1: vasculature will be completely unopposed. This will lead to vasoconstriction and trigger  删除换行1: or worsen a hypertensive crisis. It is important to ensure that patients are adequately  删除换行1: hydrated, as a sudden drop in peripheral vascular resistance with alpha-blockade will  删除换行1: cause severe hypotension! Normal saline or Hartmann’s solution can be used. Adequate  删除换行1: hydration is determined by assessment of the central venous pressure (CVP), mucous  删除换行1: membranes, skin turgor and urine output. Choice of alpha-blocker is either phenoxy删除8：<u>￾</u>benzamine or doxazosin. Once an alpha-blocker is commenced a beta-blocker such as  删除换行1: metoprolol can be administered. The beta-blocker will also reduce the tachycardic effect  删除换行1: of catecholamines. If hypertension is not controlled with alpha- and beta-blockade a  删除换行1: calcium-channel antagonist can be added. In a hypertensive emergency the first-line  删除换行1: treatment of choice should be intravenous phentolamine (alpha-blocker). Nitroprusside  删除换行1: infusion is an alternative.\n\n【26】Once blood pressure is controlled surgery should be considered. Recurrence is more likely  删除换行1: in those with a hereditary cause. If the tumour is benign then surgery has a high cure 127 删除换行1: rate. Malignant tumours have a variable course depending on timing of diagnosis and  删除换行1: treatment modalities.\n\n【27】KEY POINTS\n\n【28】• Hypertension secondary to phaeochromocytomas should be controlled with the  删除换行1: initiation of an alpha-blocker followed by a beta-blocker.\n\n【29】• Hypertension secondary to phaeochromocytomas is rare.

Because surgical correction of biliary atresia is optimally performed before 8 weeks of age (12 weeks maximal)，expeditious evaluation and potential preoperative preparations should be undertaken over next several days.\n\n【13】ANALYSIS\n\n【14】Considerations\n\n【15】Jaundice during the first week of life is a common phenomenon that affects approx-imately two-thirds of newborns. For the majority of newborns， hyperbilirubinemia is self-limiting and represents only transient physiologic jaundice (to be discussed later). It is important to note that all term infants who remain jaundiced after 14 days of life or preterm infants who remain jaundiced after 21 days should be investigated for liver diseases. The initial investigation can be with a measurement of conjugated and unconjugated serum bilirubin values. Physiologic jaundice is associated with increased serum concentrations of unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin， whereas most forms of liver diseases are associated with elevations of conjugated (direct) bilirubin. Common mechanisms that are responsible for pathologic jaundice in neonates include biliary obstruction， increased hemoglobin load， and liver dysfunction.\n\n【16】The presentation of this patient is fairly typical of newborns with hyperbili-rubinemia referred for surgical evaluations. In most cases， the infant has no spe-cific symptoms. With the clinical suspicion of liver and/ or biliary disorder as the cause of jaundice， additional laboratory studies and imaging studies such liver/biliary ultrasonography and MRCP will be helpful. Useful studies to further dif-ferentiate the causes of hyperbilirubinemia for this patient include alkaline phos-phatase， y-glutamyl transferase (GGT)， AST， and ALT. At presentation， most patients with biliary atresia have GGT values >100 IU/L， alkaline phospha-tase values >600 IU/L， and AST/ALT of 80 to 200 U/L， which are consistent with her laboratory findings. The ultrasound of the gallbladder and liver will be important to determine the steps to take for this patient. If the ultrasound shows dilated intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic ductal dilatation， the next step in the investigation is to determine the level and cause of biliary obstruction. Com-mon obstructive processes encountered in newborns include cystic malforma-tions (choledochal cysts)， other extrahepatic biliary obstructive processes such as a predominant extrahepatic form of biliary atresia (Type 2).\n\n【17】APPROACHTO：\n\n【18】DEFINITIONS\n\n【19】PHYSIOLOGIC NEONATAL HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA： The newborn is sus-ceptible to hyperbilirubinemia because of breakdown of red cell and decreased ability to excrete the bilirubin. For the majority of newborns this process is self-limiting and harmless. Bilirubin production is especially increased in 删除换行1: preterm infants because of increased RBC turnover due to shorter life span of RBCs.Another contributing factor to jaundice is the limited ability of newborn liver to conjugate and secrete bilirubin. The average full-term newborn has a peak serum bilirubin of 5 to 6 mg/ dL. Serum bilirubin >17 mg/ dL is regarded as pathologic.\n\n【20】GENERAL CELLULAR TOXICITYDUE TO EXCESS BILIRUBIN： Bilirubin inhibits mitochondrial enzymes and interferes with DNA synthesis， induces DN A-strand breaks， and inhibits protein synthesis and phosphorylation.\n\n【21】KERNICTERUS： This refers to chronic bilirubin encephalopathy. Persistent elevation in serum bilirubin in newborns is associated with bilirubin crossing the blood-brain barrier leading to injuries to neurons by mechanisms that are unclear. Kernicterus is a relatively rare condition that should be preventable with monitoring of newborn serum bilirubin levels. Reported rates of kernicterus in Western Europe and United States are 0.5 to 1.0 per 100，000 live births.\n\n【22】PHOTOTHERAPY： Phototherapy or “bili lights”is the mainstay of therapy for newborns with hyperbilirubinemia. This therapy works by photoconversion of bilirubin molecules to water soluble isomers that can be excreted in the urine and stool.\n\n【23】EXCHANGETRANSFUSIONS TO TREAT HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA：This is a more invasive therapy for in fants with hyperbilirubinemia， which entails simulta-neous removal of patient blood and replacement with donated blood. The thresh-old level suggested is serum bilirubin of>20 mg/dL.\n\n【24】CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【25】The precise cause of biliary atresia is unknown. Various speculations have been proposed， and these include viral infection and autoimmune processes. Histologi-cally， the biliary tracts contain inflammatory cells surrounding obliterated ductules. The liver shows signs of cholestasis and in later stages， fibrosis. Grossly， the most common finding is fibrosis of the entire extrahepatic biliary tree， followed by proxi-mal duct fibrosis with distal duct patency.\n\n【26】Similarly to biliary atresia， the exact etiology of choledochal cysts is unknown. A widely held opinion is that the sharing of a common channel between the common bile duct and pancreatic duct leads to retrograde reflux of pancreatic juices in the biliary tree to produce subsequent biliary dilations. There are five types of chole-dochal cysts， but the fusiform， or type 1， comprises 90% of all lesions. Infants with choledochal cysts often present with clinical jaundice.\n\n【27】Patient Evaluation\n\n【28】The diagnosis of biliary atresia is based on timing of jaundice presentation and imaging findings that rule out other mechanical causes. Biliary atresia represents a common phenotype and can be grouped into one of four categories： Isolated biliary atresia is the most common type， where biliary atresia is the only anomaly； cystic obliteration of the biliary tree (cyst+ biliary atresia) is when the atresia is associated with cystic changes； perinatal cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections can also cause bili-ary atresia and are categorized as CMV-biliary atresia； in some cases the patient删除换行4: may have syndromic biliary atresia where patients present with other congenital malformations. Identifying a cause for hyperbilirubinemia is important and the process should be performed in an expeditious manner so that if a portoenteros-tomy is to be performed， it can be done prior to the onset of irreversible injuries to the liver. See Figure 56-1 for management algorithm.\n删除3：<u>Figure 56-1. Management algorithm for new born jaundice.</u>\n\n【29】Biliary Atresia Screening\n\n【30】In some countries， there are widely implemented biliary atresia screening systems， which attempt to identify the disease at the early stages. In Taiwan， the screen-ing protocol involves giving mothers color-coded cards to help them identify pale stools. This screening program has been reported to shorten the time to portoen-terostomy to a median infant age of<50 days.\n\n【31】Preoperative Preparation ofPatients with Biliary Atresia\n\n【32】Prior to surgical treatment， the patients need to be evaluated for coagulation abnormalities， anemia， and hypoproteinemia. Correction of coagulopathy usually 删除换行1: requires both vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma. Anemia may need to be addressed with blood transfusions. Parents of patients with biliary atresia should be made aware of the long-term prognosis of the disease and understand the role of portoenenterostomy.\n\n【33】Treatment of Biliary Atresia\n\n【34】The Kasai portoenterostomy (KPE) is the operation of choice for the treatment of young infants with biliary atresia when synthetic functions of the liver are pre-served. The operation involves excision of the entire extrahepatic biliary tree and exploration ofthe porta hepatis at the liver hilum to expose the ductules within the liver. A Roux-limb (defunctionalized limb) of jejunum is then anastomosed to the cut surface of the liver. This procedure is optimal for patients with preserved liver functions and no cirrhosis； therefore， the timing of diagnosis and referral for surgi-cal treatment is critical for these patients. Some groups believe that best outcomes are achieved with the operations being performed before 8 weeks of age. Unfortu-nately， there is no clear evidence available to indicate the optimal time when biliary decompression procedures should be accomplished. In some centers， the approach is to forego portoenterostomy and proceed directly to liver transplantation if the patient is older than 100 days of age.\n\n【35】Postoperative Care and Outcomes\n\n【36】Important postsurgical care for these patients includes prevention， detection， and treatment of cholangitis， as infections cause additional liver damage. Impor-tant nutritional goals in postoperatively include the preventing malnutrition and addressing the malabsorption caused by liver dysfunction. High-energy and high protein formulas are generally recommended. It is important to treat the steator-rhea and malabsorption of fat soluble vitamins that are common in these patients. Some groups believe that corticosteroid treatment is important based on their anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties； however， postoperative steroids benefits are not substantiated by strong clinical evidence.\n\n【37】Postoperative success following portoenterostomy is defined by a normal serum bilirubin concentration at 6 months following the operation. Following Kasai por-toenterostomy，70% of the patients will develop progressive biliary obstruction. A review of operative outcomes suggests that>80% of the patients will go on to survive more than 10 years following a successful operation. For many individu-als with biliary atresia， liver transplantation is the treatment that ultimately gives them the opportunity for prolonged survival. The timing of liver transplantation is largely based on the success of the initial Kasai portoenterostomy. Currently， 90%of the transplant patients receive liver transplantation as a secondary treatment following Kasai portoenterostomies， and only a very small percentage of patients undergo liver transplantation as their primary treatments. Liver transplantations for this population can be either a liver-related partial liver transplantation or orthotopic graft placement. The overall 10-year graft and patient survival are 73%and 86%，respectively for liver transplantation performed in children with biliary atresia.\n删除16：<u>CASE CORRELATION\n删除25：<u>See also Case 55： Wilms Tumor (Pediatric Abdominal Mass)， which is another pediatric condition.</u>\n</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【3】》", "content": "【0】Case 56\nA six-week-old girl is evaluated for persistent jaundice.

Because surgical correction of biliary atresia is optimally performed before 8 weeks of age (12 weeks maximal)，expeditious evaluation and potential preoperative preparations should be undertaken over next several days.\n\n【13】ANALYSIS\n\n【14】Considerations\n\n【15】Jaundice during the first week of life is a common phenomenon that affects approx-imately two-thirds of newborns. For the majority of newborns， hyperbilirubinemia is self-limiting and represents only transient physiologic jaundice (to be discussed later). It is important to note that all term infants who remain jaundiced after 14 days of life or preterm infants who remain jaundiced after 21 days should be investigated for liver diseases. The initial investigation can be with a measurement of conjugated and unconjugated serum bilirubin values. Physiologic jaundice is associated with increased serum concentrations of unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin， whereas most forms of liver diseases are associated with elevations of conjugated (direct) bilirubin. Common mechanisms that are responsible for pathologic jaundice in neonates include biliary obstruction， increased hemoglobin load， and liver dysfunction.\n\n【16】The presentation of this patient is fairly typical of newborns with hyperbili-rubinemia referred for surgical evaluations. In most cases， the infant has no spe-cific symptoms. With the clinical suspicion of liver and/ or biliary disorder as the cause of jaundice， additional laboratory studies and imaging studies such liver/biliary ultrasonography and MRCP will be helpful. Useful studies to further dif-ferentiate the causes of hyperbilirubinemia for this patient include alkaline phos-phatase， y-glutamyl transferase (GGT)， AST， and ALT. At presentation， most patients with biliary atresia have GGT values >100 IU/L， alkaline phospha-tase values >600 IU/L， and AST/ALT of 80 to 200 U/L， which are consistent with her laboratory findings. The ultrasound of the gallbladder and liver will be important to determine the steps to take for this patient. If the ultrasound shows dilated intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic ductal dilatation， the next step in the investigation is to determine the level and cause of biliary obstruction. Com-mon obstructive processes encountered in newborns include cystic malforma-tions (choledochal cysts)， other extrahepatic biliary obstructive processes such as a predominant extrahepatic form of biliary atresia (Type 2).\n\n【17】APPROACHTO：\n\n【18】DEFINITIONS\n\n【19】PHYSIOLOGIC NEONATAL HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA： The newborn is sus-ceptible to hyperbilirubinemia because of breakdown of red cell and decreased ability to excrete the bilirubin. For the majority of newborns this process is self-limiting and harmless. Bilirubin production is especially increased in 删除换行1: preterm infants because of increased RBC turnover due to shorter life span of RBCs.Another contributing factor to jaundice is the limited ability of newborn liver to conjugate and secrete bilirubin. The average full-term newborn has a peak serum bilirubin of 5 to 6 mg/ dL. Serum bilirubin >17 mg/ dL is regarded as pathologic.\n\n【20】GENERAL CELLULAR TOXICITYDUE TO EXCESS BILIRUBIN： Bilirubin inhibits mitochondrial enzymes and interferes with DNA synthesis， induces DN A-strand breaks， and inhibits protein synthesis and phosphorylation.\n\n【21】KERNICTERUS： This refers to chronic bilirubin encephalopathy. Persistent elevation in serum bilirubin in newborns is associated with bilirubin crossing the blood-brain barrier leading to injuries to neurons by mechanisms that are unclear. Kernicterus is a relatively rare condition that should be preventable with monitoring of newborn serum bilirubin levels. Reported rates of kernicterus in Western Europe and United States are 0.5 to 1.0 per 100，000 live births.\n\n【22】PHOTOTHERAPY： Phototherapy or “bili lights”is the mainstay of therapy for newborns with hyperbilirubinemia. This therapy works by photoconversion of bilirubin molecules to water soluble isomers that can be excreted in the urine and stool.\n\n【23】EXCHANGETRANSFUSIONS TO TREAT HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA：This is a more invasive therapy for in fants with hyperbilirubinemia， which entails simulta-neous removal of patient blood and replacement with donated blood. The thresh-old level suggested is serum bilirubin of>20 mg/dL.\n\n【24】CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【25】The precise cause of biliary atresia is unknown. Various speculations have been proposed， and these include viral infection and autoimmune processes. Histologi-cally， the biliary tracts contain inflammatory cells surrounding obliterated ductules. The liver shows signs of cholestasis and in later stages， fibrosis. Grossly， the most common finding is fibrosis of the entire extrahepatic biliary tree， followed by proxi-mal duct fibrosis with distal duct patency.\n\n【26】Similarly to biliary atresia， the exact etiology of choledochal cysts is unknown. A widely held opinion is that the sharing of a common channel between the common bile duct and pancreatic duct leads to retrograde reflux of pancreatic juices in the biliary tree to produce subsequent biliary dilations. There are five types of chole-dochal cysts， but the fusiform， or type 1， comprises 90% of all lesions. Infants with choledochal cysts often present with clinical jaundice.\n\n【27】Patient Evaluation\n\n【28】The diagnosis of biliary atresia is based on timing of jaundice presentation and imaging findings that rule out other mechanical causes. Biliary atresia represents a common phenotype and can be grouped into one of four categories： Isolated biliary atresia is the most common type， where biliary atresia is the only anomaly； cystic obliteration of the biliary tree (cyst+ biliary atresia) is when the atresia is associated with cystic changes； perinatal cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections can also cause bili-ary atresia and are categorized as CMV-biliary atresia； in some cases the patient删除换行4: may have syndromic biliary atresia where patients present with other congenital malformations. Identifying a cause for hyperbilirubinemia is important and the process should be performed in an expeditious manner so that if a portoenteros-tomy is to be performed， it can be done prior to the onset of irreversible injuries to the liver. See Figure 56-1 for management algorithm.\n删除3：<u>Figure 56-1. Management algorithm for new born jaundice.</u>\n\n【29】Biliary Atresia Screening\n\n【30】In some countries， there are widely implemented biliary atresia screening systems， which attempt to identify the disease at the early stages. In Taiwan， the screen-ing protocol involves giving mothers color-coded cards to help them identify pale stools. This screening program has been reported to shorten the time to portoen-terostomy to a median infant age of<50 days.\n\n【31】Preoperative Preparation ofPatients with Biliary Atresia\n\n【32】Prior to surgical treatment， the patients need to be evaluated for coagulation abnormalities， anemia， and hypoproteinemia. Correction of coagulopathy usually 删除换行1: requires both vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma. Anemia may need to be addressed with blood transfusions. Parents of patients with biliary atresia should be made aware of the long-term prognosis of the disease and understand the role of portoenenterostomy.\n\n【33】Treatment of Biliary Atresia\n\n【34】The Kasai portoenterostomy (KPE) is the operation of choice for the treatment of young infants with biliary atresia when synthetic functions of the liver are pre-served. The operation involves excision of the entire extrahepatic biliary tree and exploration ofthe porta hepatis at the liver hilum to expose the ductules within the liver. A Roux-limb (defunctionalized limb) of jejunum is then anastomosed to the cut surface of the liver. This procedure is optimal for patients with preserved liver functions and no cirrhosis； therefore， the timing of diagnosis and referral for surgi-cal treatment is critical for these patients. Some groups believe that best outcomes are achieved with the operations being performed before 8 weeks of age. Unfortu-nately， there is no clear evidence available to indicate the optimal time when biliary decompression procedures should be accomplished. In some centers， the approach is to forego portoenterostomy and proceed directly to liver transplantation if the patient is older than 100 days of age.\n\n【35】Postoperative Care and Outcomes\n\n【36】Important postsurgical care for these patients includes prevention， detection， and treatment of cholangitis， as infections cause additional liver damage. Impor-tant nutritional goals in postoperatively include the preventing malnutrition and addressing the malabsorption caused by liver dysfunction. High-energy and high protein formulas are generally recommended. It is important to treat the steator-rhea and malabsorption of fat soluble vitamins that are common in these patients. Some groups believe that corticosteroid treatment is important based on their anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties； however， postoperative steroids benefits are not substantiated by strong clinical evidence.\n\n【37】Postoperative success following portoenterostomy is defined by a normal serum bilirubin concentration at 6 months following the operation. Following Kasai por-toenterostomy，70% of the patients will develop progressive biliary obstruction. A review of operative outcomes suggests that>80% of the patients will go on to survive more than 10 years following a successful operation. For many individu-als with biliary atresia， liver transplantation is the treatment that ultimately gives them the opportunity for prolonged survival. The timing of liver transplantation is largely based on the success of the initial Kasai portoenterostomy. Currently， 90%of the transplant patients receive liver transplantation as a secondary treatment following Kasai portoenterostomies， and only a very small percentage of patients undergo liver transplantation as their primary treatments. Liver transplantations for this population can be either a liver-related partial liver transplantation or orthotopic graft placement. The overall 10-year graft and patient survival are 73%and 86%，respectively for liver transplantation performed in children with biliary atresia.\n删除16：<u>CASE CORRELATION\n删除25：<u>See also Case 55： Wilms Tumor (Pediatric Abdominal Mass)， which is another pediatric condition.</u>\n</u>", "index": 1168, "show": true, "start": 1168, "end": 1172, "province": ["格式规范性", "多余标点"], "isEdit": false}, {"text": "【12】hyperbilirubinemia.", "content": "【0】Case 56\nA six-week-old girl is evaluated for persistent jaundice.

For this reason， band ligation is the preferred first endoscopic modality， with 35% chance of rebleeding.

His parents have noted thathe seems to have difficulty with his vision. Physical examination reveals bilateral dislocated lenses and atall， thin body habitus with especially long extremities. Laboratory studies show increased levels of serummethionine and serum homocysteine.  |\n| --- |\n| What is the most likely diagnosis?Homocystinuria.  |\n| What is the biochemical defect in this condition? The most common form of inherited homocystinuria results from reduced activity of cystathionine synthase， an enzyme that converts homocysteine to cystathionine .

New York： McGraw-Hill， 2011：108.)</u>  |\n| What vitamin supplementation is appropriate in this condition? Vitamin B. (pyridoxine) is a necessary cofactor with cystathionine synthase. Vitamin B， supplementation has been successful in many patients with this enzyme deficiency.  |\n| In addition to vitamin supplementation， what other dietary changes should be made?The absence of cystathionine synthase means that cysteine cannot be formed from methionine. Therefore，cysteine becomes an essential amino acid. This child should be given a diet low in methionine and highin cysteine.  |\n| This boy has a marfanoid body habitus and lens subluxation， two characteristics of this condition.For which other conditions is this patient at greatly increased risk?This child is at increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Elevated plasma homocysteine increases riskof coronary artery disease， stroke， and peripheral artery disease. He is also at risk for osteoporosis.Homocysteine inhibits collagen cross-linking and over time can cause osteoporosis.  |\n| What enzyme deficiency is most likely to be found in a patient with increased serum homocysteinebut decreased serum methionine? This could be caused by a deficiency of methionine synthase. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion ofhomocysteine to methionine. Like patients with cystathionine synthase deficiency， these patients oftenhave central nervous system dysfunction and vascular disease.  |", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:31:38", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:32:11", "cost": 32.906}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:45:59", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:32:11", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:31:37"}

Carol  删除换行1: was born with congenital deafness and has brought her 16-year-old son with her to act as an  删除换行1: interpreter. She lip reads a little but feels more comfortable using sign language.\n\n【2】Carol tells you that she has had enough of her heavy bleeding and she is keen to undergo a  删除换行1: hysterectomy. However, you are slightly concerned that she also reports some inter-men删除8：<u>￾</u>strual bleeding and you need to discuss your concerns that this may be something more  删除换行1: sinister and that you need to refer her urgently for more investigations.\n\n【3】You are aware both that Carol is relying on a non-medical person to translate your concerns  删除换行1: into sign language and that the person doing the translation is her teenage son. He may feel  删除换行1: uncomfortable discussing his mum’s intimate problems and worried when you start talking  删除换行1: about possible tests for cancer.\n\n【4】Questions\n\n【5】• What could the GP do in this situation?\n\n【6】• What other scenarios can you think of where communication may be problematic?\n\n【7】• What services are available to provide support in consultations where the patient  删除换行1: cannot communicate in English?\n\n【8】ANSWER 38\n\n【9】There are many scenarios where consultations are impeded due to communication barriers. \n\n【10】Hearing impairment is just one example. More commonly encountered difficulties include lan删除8：<u>￾</u>guage barriers and other verbal communication difficulties such as learning disability or dyspha删除8：<u>￾</u>sia. When encountering a patient with communication difficulties it is up to the clinician to decide  删除换行1: how best to address the problem. In non-urgent scenarios it is often best to organise a consultation  删除换行1: with a professional interpreter present so that a face-to-face consultation can occur. In emergency  删除换行1: situations telephone interpretation services should be accessible in every healthcare setting.\n\n【11】Professional interpreters should be expected to\n\n【12】• Act in an impartial and professional manner\n\n【13】• Be fluent in the language specified\n\n【14】• Not pretend to understand something when they have not\n\n【15】• Interpret accurately without anything being omitted or added from the interaction\n\n【16】(Croydon Translation and Interpreting Service: Best Practice Guide)\n\n【17】Occasionally it may be appropriate to ask other medical professionals to act as interpreters. \n\n【18】However, using friends and relatives or other workers within a hospital should be discouraged.\n\n【19】One of the most important reasons for using a professional interpreting service is that medi删除8：<u>￾</u>cal information being obtained or given needs to be accurate. Misinterpretation, whether  删除换行1: accidental or intended, could lead to misdiagnosis or suboptimal treatment. Where consent  删除换行1: needs to be obtained to undergo a procedure, the consent would be invalid if the person  删除换行1: interpreting fails to ensure that the patient fully understands what they are consenting to.\n\n【20】Ethical concerns may arise when using non-professionals to interpret. Professional interpret删除8：<u>￾</u>ing services are bound by the same professional code of conduct as healthcare professionals,  删除换行1: whereas using a friend or relative means that confidentiality could be broken by the other  删除换行1: person present as they are not bound by any professional duty. Patients themselves may also  删除换行1: be reluctant to fully disclose potentially embarrassing or sensitive information in front of  删除换行1: their relatives. This can be easier when using an impartial third person.\n\n【21】Increasingly, patients are presenting with their children and asking them to act as interpret删除8：<u>￾</u>ers. Although this may seem useful in straightforward situations, it should not be encour删除8：<u>￾</u>aged, as often children themselves may not understand the medical information they are  删除换行1: being asked to translate and it may cause them unnecessary distress and anxiety to discuss  删除换行1: their parents’ symptoms, particularly if they are in pain or very unwell.\n\n【22】In the above scenario the GP should ask the son to explain to his mother that the GP does not feel  删除换行1: comfortable using him as an interpreter due to the sensitive nature of the questions they need  删除换行1: to ask. An interpreter should be booked for a face-to-face consultation within the next few days  删除换行1: if at all possible or the consultation could potentially be carried out by written communication.\n\n【23】Key Points\n\n【24】• Hospitals and general practices have a legal obligation to provide interpreter  删除换行1: services.\n\n【25】• Using non-professional interpreters can inhibit the doctor–patient relationship  删除换行1: and raises issues of translation mistakes and confidentiality.\n\n【26】• Family members should be used as interpreters only in an emergency where there  删除换行1: is no other option.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:34:42", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:34:53", "cost": 10.766}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:45:59", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:34:53", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:34:13"}

Lead inhibits ALA dehydratase and ferrochelatase, preventing both porphobilinogen formation and the incorporation of iron into protoporphyrin IX, the final step in heme synthesis. Inhibition of both of these steps results in ineffective heme synthesis and subsequent microcytic (hemoglobin-poor) anemia.  \n\n【7】Answer A is incorrect . Lead poisoning does not affect iron absorption from the gut.  \n\n【8】Answer B is incorrect . Lead inhibits ALA dehydratase, preventing porphyrin synthesis beyond the formation of ALA; it does not increase its actions. This causes ALA to accumulate in the urine.  \n\n【9】Answer D is incorrect . Lead does not have a high affinity for hemoglobin. This type of pathology is seen in carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. CO binds to hemoglobin with much higher affinity than oxygen, resulting in decreased oxygen-carrying capacity.  \n\n【10】Answer E is incorrect . Lead does not interrupt RBC DNA synthesis.

The boy’s mother reports that the family moved to a new home in a forested area approximately one month prior to the onset of the rash. On questioning, the boy reports that he last played in the woods two days before the rash began. Which of the following is characteristic of the cells that mediate this boy’s immune reaction?\n\n【1】> (A) Buffering of acid generated by tissue metabolism\n\n【2】> (B) Cell surface immunoglobulin receptor\n\n【3】> (C) Defense against parasitic disease\n\n【4】> (D) Degranulation and release of histamine\n\n【5】> (E) Interaction with antigen-MHC complex\n\n【6】> (F) Nonspecific phagocytosis and presentation of skin antigens\n\n【7】> (G) Phagocytosis of opsonized cells\n\n【8】 Answer: The correct answer is E . The patient is experiencing a type IV, or delayed-type, hypersensitivity reaction. These immune reactions require prior exposure to the triggering antigen and typically manifest 24-48 hours after new contact with a trigger. Type IV hypersensitivity is mediated by the action of T lymphocytes, which secrete cytokines that, in turn, recruit additional inflammatory cells to the site of contact. T-lymphocyte activation depends on interaction between the cell surface T-lymphocyte receptor and an antigen-MHC complex on an antigen-presenting cell.  \n\n【9】Answer A is incorrect . RBCs are partially responsible for the transport and buffering of acid generated by tissue metabolism. RBC carbonic anhydrase converts carbon dioxide to carbonic acid, which rapidly dissociates into a proton and a bicarbonate ion. The bicarbonate ion is in turn exchanged across the RBC membrane in a process termed the physiologic chloride shift. None of these processes is involved in delayed-type hypersensitivity.  \n\n【10】Answer B is incorrect . Cell surface immunoglobulin receptors are characteristic of B lymphocytes. Through their production of antibodies, B lymphocytes are involved in types I, II, and III hypersensitivity, but are unrelated to the pathophysiology of delayed-type hypersensitivity.  \n\n【11】Answer C is incorrect . Eosinophils are especially important in the immune system’s response to parasites and may also be associated with neoplastic processes. Eosinophils are not, however, involved in the physiology of delayed-type hypersensitivity.  \n\n【12】Answer D is incorrect . Degranulation and histamine release are characteristic of mast cells and basophils. Both are important in mediating type I hypersensitivity reactions via their cell surface IgE Fc receptors, but are not involved in delayed-type hypersensitivity.  \n\n【13】Answer F is incorrect . Nonspecific phagocytosis in the epidermal layer is characteristic of Langerhans cells, a differentiated type of dendritic cell. They are found in lymph nodes, where they act as antigen-presenting cells.  \n\n【14】Answer G is incorrect . Opsonization refers to the “marking” of foreign antigens either by antibody binding or by complement binding. In either case, certain phagocytic cells, predominately macrophages, can subsequently internalize and destroy the antigens. Although macrophages may be recruited by cytokines to the site of a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction, it is the T lymphocyte that mediates the reaction.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:16:09", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:16:13", "cost": 4.396}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:45:59", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:16:14", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:16:09"}

Uremic pericarditis is considered a medical emergency and an indication for urgent dialysis.\n\n【6】Question: 18.2 The patient described in Question 18.1 is hospitalized, but there is a delay in initiating treatment. You are called to the bedside because he has become hypotensive with systolic blood pressure of 85/68 mm Hg, a heart rate of 122 bpm, and you note pulsus paradoxus. A repeat ECG is unchanged from admission. Which of the following is the most appropriate immediate intervention?\n\n【7】A. Draw blood cultures and initiate broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected sepsis.\n\n【8】B. Intravenous furosemide for fluid overload.\n\n【9】C. Echocardiographic-guided pericardiocentesis.\n\n【10】D. Percutaneous coronary intervention for acute myocardial infarction.\n\n【11】Answer: 18.2 C. The clinical picture suggests the patient has developed pericardial tamponade, which may be life threatening and often requires urgent pericardiocentesis.\n\n【12】Question: 18.3 A 25-year-old woman complains of pain in her PIP and metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints and reports a recent positive ANA laboratory test.

Urinary sediment with RBC casts\nAnswer: 18.3 C. Sclerodactyly, which is thickened and tight skin of the fingers and toes, is a classic feature of patients with scleroderma (who may also have a positive ANA test), but is not seen in SLE. The other findings (malar rash, serositis, glomerulonephritis) are typical of SLE, but not seen in scleroderma.\n\n【17】CLINICAL PEARLS\n\n【18】 Acute pericarditis is characterized by pleuritic chest pain, a pericardial friction rub, and ECG findings of diffuse ST-segment elevation and PR-segment depression.\n\n【19】 Pericardial friction rub does not exclude a pericardial effusion; patients with acute pericarditis should be monitored for development of effusion and tamponade.\n\n【20】 Treatment of pericarditis is directed at the underlying cause; for example, for uremic pericarditis, urgent dialysis is necessary.

Educate patient to monitor for signs and symptoms of dehydration.\n\n【40】   Patients should also monitor for dehydration (volume depletion) when first started on SGLT2i medications especially in combination with loop diuretics.\n\n【41】   Digoxin toxicity can present acutely in the setting of acute kidney injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Providers should thoroughly assess for symptoms of digoxin toxicity in the setting of acute kidney injury and consider stopping or holding digoxin.\n\n【42】   Escalation of HF GDMT should not occur in the setting of volume depletion or volume overload. Close follow-up is recommended to reassess fluid status and to determine if additional medication titration can be made.\n\n【43】   Obtaining orthostatic blood pressures in clinic can be a useful tool to help identify volume depletion.\n\n【44】19.3 Case Study 3\n-----------------\n\n【45】### 19.3.1 HFrEF Optimization Considerations in the Setting of Volume Overload\n\n【46】Name : Samuel Jones\n\n【47】Age/Sex: 56-year-old male\n\n【48】Past Medical History/Problem List : HFrEF (LVEF 25%), Ischemic Cardiomyopathy, Single Chamber Implanted Cardiac Defibrillator, HTN, CAD (history of CABG 10 years ago), Hyperlipidemia, CKD Stage 2.\n\n【49】Family History : Mother died at age 68 of lung cancer. Father died at age 48 of MI. Has one brother with history of stroke and two healthy adult children.\n\n【50】Psychosocial History : Married. Has two adult children. Works full time as a banker. No history of tobacco use or illicit drugs.\n\n【51】Medications/Allergies\n\n【52】   Sacubitril/valsartan 49/51 mg BID\n\n【53】   Carvedilol 12.5 mg BID\n\n【54】   Spironolactone 25 mg daily\n\n【55】   Dapagliflozin 10 mg daily\n\n【56】   Furosemide 40 mg daily\n\n【57】   Atorvastatin 80 mg QHS\n\n【58】   ASA 81 mg daily\n\n【59】Allergies : No Known Drug Allergies\n\n【60】Case Scenario : Mr. Jones presents to primary care office with a chief complaint of swelling in feet and ankles. He was recently seen by his cardiologist last month and was told his left ventricular ejection fraction had fallen from 35% to 25%. Recent stress test did not reveal any new ischemia and Mr. Jones’ decline in ejection fraction was felt to be due to uncontrolled hypertension. Carvedilol was increased from 6.25 mg BID to 12.5 mg BID last month. In review of home blood pressure log, blood pressure remains elevated ranging from 144/90 mmHg to 160/92 mmHg. Home weight trends also elevated 10 pounds above dry weight goal. Mr. Jones states he recently returned from a weekend vacation and ate out several times, consuming food high in sodium. He is concerned about increased swelling in his feet and ankles, abdominal distention, and shortness of breath walking to his mailbox. Denies orthopnea, PND, bendopnea, chest pain, palpitations, or ICD shocks.\n\n【61】Objective : Vital signs: BP 148/84 mmHg left arm, 150/80 mmHg right arm; HR 80; Oxygen Saturation 98% on room air; Temp 98.7°. Weight 250 pounds. Physical exam: Lungs clear, JVD elevated ~12 cm with exam table at 45°, heart rate and rhythm regular, positive S3, no murmur. 1+ bilateral pedal edema. Extremities are warm. Capillary refill less than 3 s.\n\n【62】Diagnostic Reports\n\n【63】   Labs results: Sodium 140; Potassium 4.0; BUN 28; Creatinine 1.4; (eGFR 50), Pro BNP 2000\n\n【64】   Echocardiogram (1 month ago): LVEF 25%, LVIDD 6.2 cm, no valvular abnormalities\n\n【65】   Echocardiogram (1 year ago): LVEF 35%, LVIDD 5.5 cm, no valvular abnormalities\n\n【66】Assessment : Mr. Jones presents to clinic with acute on chronic heart failure exacerbation, exhibiting signs and symptoms of fluid volume overload, likely secondary to increased dietary sodium intake. Also concerning is a recent drop in left ventricular ejection fraction and further dilation of his left ventricle (LVIDD of 6.2 cm, up from previous 5.5 cm). Heart failure progression felt to be due to uncontrolled hypertension.\n\n【67】Plan\n\n【68】1.  1.\n\n【69】    Acute on Chronic HFrEF\n\n【70】    Etiology : Ischemic, Dilated Cardiomyopathy\n\n【71】    NYHA Class : III\n\n【72】    Hemodynamic Status : Warm and wet\n\n【73】    Devices : Single Chamber ICD\n\n【74】    Plan :\n\n【75】       Increase Furosemide to 40 mg BID × 3 days, then back to maintenance dose of 40 mg daily.\n\n【76】       Continue Sacubitril/Valsartan 49/51 mg BID, Carvedilol 12.5 mg BID, Spironolactone 25 mg daily, Dapagliflozin 10 mg daily.\n\n【77】       Return to clinic in one week to reassess fluid status, obtain labs, and consider escalation of HF GDMT.\n\n【78】One Week Follow-Up\n\n【79】Mr. Jones returns to clinic in one week. He is now back to his dry weight of 240 pounds and notes resolution of symptoms. On exam, JVD is not elevated, and lower extremity edema resolved. Home blood pressure log reviewed, and blood pressure remains elevated, 134/88 mmHg to 140/90 mmHg. Clinic blood pressure in left arm is 140/84 mmHg. HR is 78 bpm.\n\n【80】Repeat labs at follow-up notable for decrease in Pro BNP, down to 700. Kidney function is stable, Creatinine 1.3, BUN 55. Potassium level 4.3.\n\n【81】Follow-Up Plan\n\n【82】1.  1.\n\n【83】    Chronic HFrEF\n\n【84】    NYHA Class : I\n\n【85】    Hemodynamic status : Warm and euvolemic\n\n【86】       Increase Carvedilol to 18.75 mg BID (12.5 mg tablets taking one and a half tablet) for two weeks then increase further to 25 mg BID.\n\n【87】       Continue Sacubitril/Valsartan 49/51 mg BID, Spironolactone 25 mg daily, and Dapagliflozin 10 mg daily.\n\n【88】       Continue Furosemide 40 mg daily.\n\n【89】       Prescribe rescue diuretic plan—if patient experiences 2–3 pound weight gain overnight, or 5 pounds in one week, increase Furosemide 40 mg BID for one day, then back to maintenance dose. Not to exceed more than one extra dose per week without notifying provider. Patient verbalized understanding of instruction and when to notify clinic.\n\n【90】Clinical Pearls\n\n【91】   Any decline in cardiac function warrants further investigation to determine the cause. In the case of Mr. Jones, ischemic evaluation was negative. The decline in heart function was likely due to uncontrolled hypertension.\n\n【92】   Escalation of HF GDMT should be consistently evaluated until maximum tolerated doses are achieved 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【93】   In the setting of fluid volume overload, patients should be decongested prior to escalating GDMT, especially beta-blockers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【94】   Close follow-up following outpatient diuresis is important to assure response to treatment and consider GDMT escalation.\n\n【95】   Establishing a rescue diuretic regimen can be helpful in preventing extreme fluid overload. Careful education and ensuring patient understanding of instructions is important prior to prescribing.\n\n【96】   To help patients better tolerate up-titration of beta-blockers, doses can be half stepped upwards as demonstrated in this case.\n\n【97】   HFrEF patients can expect to feel mildly fatigued and have a small amount of fluid gain with up-titration of beta-blockers, which can be managed with a rescue diuretic regimen if needed. These symptoms typically improve quickly.\n\n【98】   Mr. Jones’ Pro BNP level went down from 2000 to 700. Although 700 is still elevated by normal value criteria, heart failure patients with dilated cardiomyopathy may have a chronic BNP elevation. Assessing trends and determining baseline is important to avoid over- or under-diuresis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:50:33", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:51:06", "cost": 33.316}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:45:59", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:51:05", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:50:32"}

She is a G2P2002, married, nonsmoker who desires to discuss contraceptive options. She does desire to become pregnant again but not in the near future. She denies any prior sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and has no significant medical concerns or complaints.\n\n【2】 What are the long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) agents ?\n\n【3】 As compared to oral contraceptive (OC) agents, what are the advantages of LARC agents?\n\n【4】 What are the mechanisms of action of the types of LARCs?\n\n【5】ANSWERS TO CASE 54:\n\n【6】Contraceptive Management\n\n【7】Summary : A 25-year-old female without medical problems or complaints who desires long-term but reversible contraception\n\n【8】 The LARC category of contraceptives include IUD (copper vs. Mirena— progestin based), hormone injections (progesterone based), and subdermal implants such as Implanon (progestin based).\n\n【9】 An advantage of LARC over OCP (oral contraceptive pill) is that they do not have to be taken daily by the patient and as such often results in higher typical use efficacy.\n\n【10】 The LARC agents are either progestin based or copper based. The mechanism of action for the progesterone only products (Implanon, Depo-Provera injection, Mirena IUD) are to suppress ovulation and make the cervical environment less favorable for sperm survival/transport and endometrial implantation. The copper IUD functions as a spermicide (inhibits sperm motility/transport/acrosomal enzyme action and prevents fertilization of the ovum.\n\n【11】#### CLINICAL CORRELATION\n\n【12】The choice of contraception depends on a variety of factors. In some cases the risk of comorbidities may limit the options. At times the choice is dependent on logistics of how often the contraceptive has to be used. Duration of desired contraception is another key factor in choosing the right contraceptive for a given patient. In patients who prefer concurrent STI prevention, barrier methods would be ideal. In patients who no longer desire fertility, surgical options may be suggested. A thorough medical/surgical/social history along with a full review of systems should be done prior to initiation of contraception to offer a customized method for the patient. Some of the contraceptives may offer other noncontraceptive benefits (discussed later). Cost is another factor in choosing contraceptives. Often, minor side effects will abate in a few months, so having this discussion with the patient in the beginning may minimize confusion and frustration.\n\n【13】If unprotected sex occurs and pregnancy is not desired, emergency contraceptives are readily available and are a viable option. However, the patient must be informed that this method should not be the sole contraceptive management, nor should it be used in preventing STIs.\n\n【14】APPROACH TO:\n\n【15】Contraceptive Agents\n\n【16】#### OBJECTIVES\n\n【17】1\\. Discuss the categories of various contraceptive options and their respective mechanisms of action.\n\n【18】2\\. Discuss the noncontraceptive uses for the various agents.\n\n【19】3\\. Discuss the risks and benefits of the agents.\n\n【20】4\\. Address issues pertaining to emergency contraception\n\n【21】#### DEFINITIONS\n\n【22】Contraception: Intentional prevention of pregnancy via the use of various agents/devices/sexual practices/surgical procedures by interfering with any or several of the following processes: implantation, fertilization, ovulation.\n\n【23】Emergency contraception: Using contraception after unprotected intercourse— consensual or nonconsensual—to prevent pregnancy.\n\n【24】#### DISCUSSION\n\n【25】Note that this case will not address all the available options for contraception. For a full discussion on all the options (natural family planning, hormonal agents, surgical techniques, barrier methods) refer to the Family Medicine and/or Obstetrics and Gynecology Case Files 删除25：<u></u>.\n删除4：<u>Table 54–1 • Contraceptive Options</u>\n\n【26】#### CLASSES OF AGENTS\n\n【27】##### Oral Contraceptive (OC) Agents\n\n【28】All oral contraceptive agents are hormonal agents, but differ in that they can either be a combination of estrogen/progestin or be a progestin only. Most of the OCPs contain the combination, although there are a few that have only progesterone. The extended duration contraceptive pills also contain combination of estrogen and progesterone.\n\n【29】The estrogen component is typically ethinyl estradiol, whereas the progesterone may vary and is usually either a first, second, third, or fourth generation (pregnanes, estranes, gonanes, or drospirenone products, respectively). The combination OCPs can vary in their dosing strength of the individual components, whereas all the other options have fixed dosing. The ethinyl estradiol may commonly come in the following strengths: 20, 25, 30, 35 micrograms. The progesterone dose varies based on the individual component used. The combination OCP may also come as monophasic or biphasic/triphasic options—the latter two where the individual components vary in their dose based on the day to reflect the physiologic variations. The monophasic options have less menstrual irregularities in general. Nausea, headaches, elevated blood pressure, weight gain, decreased libido, and dyslipidemia may occur with the estrogen component but often can be diminished by decreasing the dose of estrogen or with continued use. Due to the EE component, there is also a low risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and cardiovascular disease that is increased in smokers (especially those who smoke >15 cigarettes daily) or women above the age of 35. These risks are less than 1 percent. The possible association with breast cancer in estrogen containing products is also low (<1%). The World Health Organization (WHO) has categorized the precautions and contraindications to OCP use into four categories. Some of the noncontraceptive benefits of using combination estrogen/progesterone products include reduction in ovarian and endometrial cancer, improvements in acne, dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia, metrorrhagia, and functional cysts. For progesterone-based products, the main adverse events include risk for hirsutism, acne, menstrual irregularity, and spotting. There are also concerns of weight gain and decreased bone mineral density with continued use. The progestin-only pills are also less effective than the combination OCPs (0.5% vs. 0.1% failure rate of progestin only vs. combination OCP with perfect use or 1% to 3% failure rate for either product with typical use) and also have less flexibility in timing. The oral agents have many interactions that can affect the effectiveness of the OCP or the other medication.\n\n【30】Mechanism of Action\n\n【31】The estrogen component inhibits ovulation by suppressing LH and FSH and prevents implantation. The progesterone component inhibits ovulation by suppressing LH, thickens cervical mucus, and thins the endometrial lining thereby preventing sperm transport and implantation.\n\n【32】Administration\n\n【33】The OCPs (combination and progestin-only pills) are taken orally around the same time each day. The progestin-only pills have less flexibility (need to be taken within an hour of the time daily, whereas the combination pills may be taken within 3 hours of the daily time). The OCPs come in a pack of 21 active pills and 7 placebo pills. With the use of the placebo pills, the patient will start her withdrawal bleed. If a patient prefers to limit her menses then she can opt to just take the active pills continuously or use a marketed extended use agent. Seasonale and Seasonique are two commercially marketed extended duration OCPs. Despite patient concerns, this approach is effective and has not shown evidence of increased harm. Patients may customize when they have their menses as well by when they start the OCP pack; for example, starting on a Sunday would in theory eliminate menses on weekends. Emergency contraception at present is marketed as an oral tablet (progestin based) that can be taken either as 2 tablets at once or each one 12 hours apart— Plan B. A new option, Ella (a progesterone agonist/antagonist) is a single 30-mg tablet that is reportedly effective up to 5 days post intercourse. Apart from this, many commercially available OCPs can be used for emergency contraception by altering the amount of pills taken. This form is most effective if taken immediately after, but success rates are still high 24–120 hours post unprotected intercourse.\n\n【34】Pharmacokinetics\n\n【35】Due to the lipophilic nature of the estrogens and progestins, these drugs are readily absorbed following oral administration. The ethinyl substitution on 17β-estradiol inhibits first-pass hepatic metabolism. Estrogens undergo enterohepatic recirculation, which depends in part on hydrolysis of hepatic conjugates in the gut by bacterial enzymes. Antibiotic treatment can reduce effectiveness of OCP or HRT (Hormone Replacement Therapy). Several medications may interact with OC agents.\n\n【36】##### Transdermal and Intravaginal Agents\n\n【37】Currently available transdermal (Ortho Evra) and intravaginal (NuvaRing) contraceptives are both combination estrogen/progestin products. These agents provide a more consistent delivery of the hormones and permit a lower dose than oral preparations. The intravaginal product, NuvaRing, is placed into the posterior fornix of the vagina, left in place for 3 weeks, and removed for 1 week. The transdermal product (Ortho Evra) is placed on the buttock/upper torso/abdomen/upper arm weekly and changed once a week for 3 weeks, with the 4th week being a patch-free period. The Ortho Evra patch is restricted to patients less than 198 pounds due to decreased effectiveness in patients above this weight. The efficacy, mechanism of action, benefits, and risks are comparable to the combination OC agents. These agents also have the same noncontraceptive benefits as the combination OC agents. Local skin or mucosal irritation may occur with either of these options but are not typical.\n\n【38】##### Barrier Methods\n\n【39】Commonly available barrier methods include male and female condoms, diaphragm, cervical caps, and contraceptive sponges. Neither the condoms nor contraceptive sponges require a prescription. These agents have fewer side effects than hormonal contraception and have the dual benefit of contraception and STI prevention. Additionally, if a double barrier is used (eg, condom + vaginal spermicide or diaphragm + condom), efficacy increases substantially. The major issue with these options is compliance with use as they are only effective if a new product is used at each episode of intercourse. Oral condoms are also available to provide additional protection. Another drawback of this method is the possibility of improper placement or breakage in which case both contraception and STI prevention are compromised. Local skin or mucosal reactions are usually uncommon.\n\n【40】##### Long-Acting Reversible Contraceptive (LARC) Agents\n\n【41】LARCs commonly used in the United States include medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo-Provera as the Brand) progesterone acetate injections (DMPAs), Mirena (progestin based) IUD, Implanon (progestin based) subdermal agent, and copper IUD. DMPA is an injectable progesterone-based contraceptive that is given intramuscularly or subcutaneously (Depo-sub QProvera 104) every 3 months. Its efficacy is higher than the oral progestin mainly due to the fact that patients do not have to take the medication daily. DMPA is administered subcutaneously (SQ) and has been available since 2010. It uses 30 percent less hormone, is less painful, has similar efficacy, and has had success for self-administration by the patient in several trials. The predominant adverse effects of DMPA (SQ and IM) include weight gain of 3.5 to 5 pounds in the first year and menstrual irregularity/amenorrhea. There are also long-term concerns of decreases in bone mineral density with the use of any progesterone-only contraceptive agent. Intrauterine devices are typically inserted as an office procedure while the patient is on her menses and is to be removed in 5 or 10 years. The Mirena IUD (5-year product) has the same benefits/risks/mechanism of action as the other progestin-based products. The Mirena IUD may also be used for emergency contraception. The copper IUD (10-year product) functions essentially as a barrier agent and as a spermicide (inhibits sperm motility/transport/acrosomal enzyme action) and prevents fertilization of the ovum. Most common side effects include increased dysmenorrhea or increased menstrual flow for the first few months. The intradermal product (Implanon) is inserted as an office procedure subdermally into the medial aspect of the upper arm and removed in 1 year or 3 years depending on the product used. Implanon has the same mechanism of action/benefits/risks as the other progestin-only products.\n\n【42】##### Permanent Contraception\n\n【43】For women and their partners who desire permanent sterility, currently available options include bilateral tubal ligation, vasectomy, hysterectomy (if other indications), and fallopian tube obstruction methods (Essure and Adiana). Vasectomy is an office procedure that can be done in the primary care or specialist office and requires only local anesthesia. The procedure often takes 30 minutes to complete but requires the male to submit semen samples until sterility is assured (typically 6 weeks). Although reversal may be possible depending on the technique used initially, patients should be counseled that this is a permanent procedure. Bilateral tubal ligation is an operative procedure done under general anesthesia in the operating room. This may be reversed, but generally is considered a permanent procedure. Essure and Adiana are permanent sterilization techniques in which silicone coils are inserted into the fallopian tubes, which eventually lead to permanent scarring/occlusion of the area and offer permanent sterilization. This procedure is typically done via an office procedure and requires a separate procedure termed hysterosalpingogram (HSG) for placement and for verification. Once the procedure success has been verified (typically 3 months), sterility is fairly assured.\n\n【44】####", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:36:18", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:36:39", "cost": 20.558}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:45:59", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:36:39", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:36:18"}

Bone marrow suppression may occur following irradiation to the pelvis and long bones\n\n【44】●Long-term toxicity： cutaneous hyperpigmentation， impaired function of iirradiated viscera， bone necrosis， myelopathy and secondary malignancies.\n\n【45】What is the difference between the units gray and sievert， and which is the unit of radiation dose?\n\n【46】Sievert (Sv) is a measure of the biological effect of a dose， whereas gray(Gy) measures the absorbed dose.\n\n【47】What do you know about the inverse square law?\n\n【48】The inverse square law states that radiation intensity decreases with the square of the distance away from a point source of radiation. The intensity of radiation at any given radius is given by the source strength divided by the area of the sphere. For example， the energy intensity three times as far from a point source is spread over nine times the area， hence one ninth the intensity.\n\n【49】The use of radiation began shortly after the discovery of X-rays by Roentgen in 1895 (Lancet 1997；349(suppl1)：1-3).\n\n【50】RAGE (Radiotherapy Action Group Exposure) is a pressure group formed by patients who suffered the side effects of radiotherapy including brachial plexus neuropathy， often resulting in severe pain and the loss of use of the arm.", "index": 5048, "show": true, "start": 5048, "end": 5077, "comment": "49", "isEdit": false, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"]}], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:54:37", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:55:17", "cost": 39.109}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:45:58", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:55:17", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:54:37"}

Although most cases of Alzheimer disease are sporadic， up to10 percent of cases are inherited. The more common sporadic form of Alzheimer disease is associated with the presence of the E4 isotype of ApoE. In contrast， many familial cases are associated with amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its processing to Af peptides. Additionally， two genes are associated with early-onset familial Alzheimer disease. These genes encode for presenilin-1 and presenilin-2. Mutations in these genes may increase the production of Ap.\n\n【19】\\[13.2\\] E. The combination of a shuffling gait， stooped posture， slowness of movement (bradykinesia)， muscle rigidity， and a pill-rolling tremor at rest is highly suggestive of the diagnosis of Parkinson disease. These symptoms are caused by a deficiency of dopamine that results from degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra. Within this area some of the neurons will have intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusions that are called Lewy bodies.\n\n【20】\\[13.3\\] E. Bilateral atrophy of the caudate nuclei is characteristic of Huntington disease， an inherited autosomal dominant disease that is characterized by the combination of choreiform movements， depres-sion， and progressive dementia.

While trying to study， he often finds himself falling asleep with his contact lenses still in. As finals week draws to a close， he is scratching his eyes often because they feel dry and painful， as if there are foreign bodies in them. He also notices that his eyes are red and that he tears up frequently.\n\n【2】What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【3】Keratitis caused by the free-living ameba Acanthamoeba is the most likely diagnosis. Conditions to consider in the differential diagnosis include herpes simplex virus (HSV)， herpes zoster virus， and bacterial or fungal infection. However， HSV keratitis would present with photophobia， decreased visual acuity， and dendritic ulcer formation， which are not seen in this patient. Likewise， a bacterial or fungal source would present with accompanying systemic symptoms， and orbital cellulitis would create an ophthalmologic emergency.\n\n【4】What are the risk factors for developing this condition?\n\n【5】The number one risk factor for Acanthamoeba infection is extended wearing of contact lenses. Inadequate disinfection of the lenses with homemade saline solution and wearing lenses while swimming or showering can also predispose contact lens wearers to this infection. Acanthamoeba organisms can live in soil， air， and water and are resistant to chlorine.\n\n【6】What are other symptoms and complications of this condition?\n\n【7】Unlike bacterial keratitis， keratitis from Acanthamoeba takes days or weeks to cause symptoms. The initial symptoms are usually redness and a feeling of a foreign body in the eye. Blurring of vision may also be present. Over time， this progresses to pain， lid edema， and conjunctival injection. If untreated， increased intraocular pressure， cataracts， and even loss of vision can develop.\n\n【8】How is this condition diagnosed?\n\n【9】The diagnosis is made by slit-lamp examination of the eye， which shows thickened epithelium and rough corneal nerves. A characteristic ring on the cornea may also appear approximately 6 weeks after initial infection. Corneal scraping or biopsy reveals irregular polygonal cysts.\n\n【10】What is the appropriate treatment for this condition?\n\n【11】Initial treatment consists of topical antimicrobials such as miconazole and neomycin for several months. If the infection has been left untreated (ie， at the corneal ring stage)， surgery， such as corneal debridement， is usually required.\n\n【12】What populations are at risk for this condition?\n\n【13】Populations include chronic disease patients， such as those with lymphoproliferative disorders， patients on chronic steroids， patients receiving chemotherapy， andpatients with AIDS. In these populations， the infection is usually not of the eye but rather of the central nervous system. These patients present with changes in mental status， headache， and stiff neck. They can also develop cranial nerve palsies， ataxia， and hemiparesis (termed granulomatous amebic encephalitis). Treatment is urgent in such cases.\n\n|", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:36:01", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:36:07", "cost": 6.054}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:45:58", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:36:07", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:36:00"}

This patient most likely has diabetic nephropathy caused by long-standing and often poorly managed DM. The patient’s presentation is typical for nephrotic syndrome, with massive proteinuria and peripheral and periorbital edema. Blood tests would likely have shown hypoalbuminemia and hyperlipidemia, which are also associated with nephrotic syndrome. The image shows changes typically associated with diabetic nephropathy, including basement membrane thickening and presence of hyaline deposits in the periphery of the glomerulus (known as Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodular lesions). The increased glucose levels in diabetes can lead to vascular damage, and diabetes is strongly associated with coronary artery disease. In addition to management of lipids and blood glucose, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin II receptor blockers are beneficial in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy.  \n\n【9】Answer A is incorrect . Although renal disease associated with SLE may have similar presenting symptoms (proteinuria, peripheral and periorbital edema, and hypoalbuminemia), the image shows Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodular lesions, which are characteristic of diabetic nephropathy. With SLE, there are five different patterns of renal involvement. In the membranous glomerulonephritis pattern, biopsy reveals wire-loop lesions with subepithelial deposits. In addition to arthritis, symptoms of SLE include fatigue, malar rash, photosensitivity, pleuritis, pericarditis, and many more.  \n\n【10】Answer B is incorrect . Although renal disease associated with amyloidosis has similar presenting symptoms (proteinuria, peripheral and periorbital edema, and hypoalbuminemia), the image shows Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodular lesions, which are characteristic of diabetic nephropathy. Renal biopsy viewed under immunofluorescence with Congo red stain reveals apple-green birefringence in patients with amyloidosis. One excellent example of amyloidosis is amyloid from immunoglobulin light chains, which is produced by cancerous plasma cells in multiple myeloma. In addition to bone pain, signs and symptoms of multiple myeloma include renal failure, elevated calcium, anemia, and increased vulnerability to infection.  \n\n【11】Answer D is incorrect . Alport syndrome is an inherited glomerular disease caused by a mutation in type IV collagen. It can be inherited in an X-linked or an autosomal recessive manner. It typically presents with recurrent episodes of gross hematuria during childhood. It is associated with sensorineural hearing loss and ocular disorders. Renal biopsy would show a split basement membrane, not the Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodular lesions shown in the image.  \n\n【12】Answer E is incorrect . Goodpasture disease results in a rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, with proteinuria and hematuria, and alveolar hemorrhage causing shortness of breath and hemoptysis. It is caused by antibodies directed against the glomerular basement membrane. Renal biopsy with immunofluorescence would show linear deposition of IgG along the glomerular membrane. Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodular lesions, as seen in the image, would not be observed.  \n\n【13】Answer F is incorrect . Acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is associated with recent streptococcal infection, which would present with a history of pharyngitis, low-grade fever, swollen lymph nodes, and tonsillar exudates. It is seen most often in children, and although it shares with diabetic nephropathy the presenting symptoms of peripheral and periorbital edema and proteinuria, it usually also presents with either gross or microscopic hematuria, which is not found in this patient. Additionally, renal biopsy of a patient with acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis would typically show a “lumpy bumpy” appearance on light microscopy, with neutrophilic infiltrate and subepithelial deposits.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【1】> Reproduced, with permission, from USMLERx.com", "content": "【0】Question: A 67-year-old obese man complains of swelling in his hands, feet, and face.

This patient most likely has diabetic nephropathy caused by long-standing and often poorly managed DM. The patient’s presentation is typical for nephrotic syndrome, with massive proteinuria and peripheral and periorbital edema. Blood tests would likely have shown hypoalbuminemia and hyperlipidemia, which are also associated with nephrotic syndrome. The image shows changes typically associated with diabetic nephropathy, including basement membrane thickening and presence of hyaline deposits in the periphery of the glomerulus (known as Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodular lesions). The increased glucose levels in diabetes can lead to vascular damage, and diabetes is strongly associated with coronary artery disease. In addition to management of lipids and blood glucose, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin II receptor blockers are beneficial in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy.  \n\n【9】Answer A is incorrect . Although renal disease associated with SLE may have similar presenting symptoms (proteinuria, peripheral and periorbital edema, and hypoalbuminemia), the image shows Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodular lesions, which are characteristic of diabetic nephropathy. With SLE, there are five different patterns of renal involvement. In the membranous glomerulonephritis pattern, biopsy reveals wire-loop lesions with subepithelial deposits. In addition to arthritis, symptoms of SLE include fatigue, malar rash, photosensitivity, pleuritis, pericarditis, and many more.  \n\n【10】Answer B is incorrect . Although renal disease associated with amyloidosis has similar presenting symptoms (proteinuria, peripheral and periorbital edema, and hypoalbuminemia), the image shows Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodular lesions, which are characteristic of diabetic nephropathy. Renal biopsy viewed under immunofluorescence with Congo red stain reveals apple-green birefringence in patients with amyloidosis. One excellent example of amyloidosis is amyloid from immunoglobulin light chains, which is produced by cancerous plasma cells in multiple myeloma. In addition to bone pain, signs and symptoms of multiple myeloma include renal failure, elevated calcium, anemia, and increased vulnerability to infection.  \n\n【11】Answer D is incorrect . Alport syndrome is an inherited glomerular disease caused by a mutation in type IV collagen. It can be inherited in an X-linked or an autosomal recessive manner. It typically presents with recurrent episodes of gross hematuria during childhood. It is associated with sensorineural hearing loss and ocular disorders. Renal biopsy would show a split basement membrane, not the Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodular lesions shown in the image.  \n\n【12】Answer E is incorrect . Goodpasture disease results in a rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, with proteinuria and hematuria, and alveolar hemorrhage causing shortness of breath and hemoptysis. It is caused by antibodies directed against the glomerular basement membrane. Renal biopsy with immunofluorescence would show linear deposition of IgG along the glomerular membrane. Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodular lesions, as seen in the image, would not be observed.  \n\n【13】Answer F is incorrect . Acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is associated with recent streptococcal infection, which would present with a history of pharyngitis, low-grade fever, swollen lymph nodes, and tonsillar exudates. It is seen most often in children, and although it shares with diabetic nephropathy the presenting symptoms of peripheral and periorbital edema and proteinuria, it usually also presents with either gross or microscopic hematuria, which is not found in this patient. Additionally, renal biopsy of a patient with acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis would typically show a “lumpy bumpy” appearance on light microscopy, with neutrophilic infiltrate and subepithelial deposits.", "index": 430, "show": true, "start": 430, "end": 480, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:24:55", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:25:08", "cost": 13.564}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:45:58", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:25:08", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:24:53"}

The antegrade effective refractory period of the accessory pathway while pacing the distal coronary sinus electrodes at a coupling interval of 400 ms was 230 ms, confirming the malignant character of the accessory pathway. At this coupling interval, atrial fibrillation was induced. After a waiting period of 30 min, the atrial fibrillation persisted. Given the malignant character of the accessory pathway, the presence of symptomatic recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation, a decision to ablate the accessory pathway was taken.\n\n【13】Given the aspect of the 12-lead ECG during sinus rhythm, the localization of the accessory pathway was considered to be in the lateral part of the mitral annulus (positive delta waves in leads V1-V6, lead II, III and aVF, negative in lead I and aVL). Mapping of the mitral annulus was subsequently performed.\n\n【14】Access to the mitral valve was obtained using an antegrade approach. A single transseptal puncture was performed under fluoroscopic guidance using an 8.5F 67cm Swartz SL0™ transseptal sheath (Abbott <sup>® </sup> ) and a BRK ™ XS 71 cm needle (Abbott <sup>® </sup> ).\n\n【15】After the transseptal puncture, anticoagulation was obtained with unfractionated Heparin 70 IU/kg given as bolus, followed by continuous infusion of 12 IU/kg/h, with a target ACT of 300 seconds.\n\n【16】Once the access to the left atrium was granted, the SmartTouch SF roving/ablation catheter was introduced in the SL0 transseptal sheath, and mapping of the mitral valve was performed. An anatomical map of the left atrium was first created, which showed a non-dilated felt atrium with a volume of 65 ml. An activation map targeting the earliest local ventricular activation was subsequently created during atrial fibrillation, with careful analysis of the local ventricular electrograms recorded around the mitral annulus. The earliest local ventricular activation was recorded in the lateral region of the annulus, corresponding to the 2’clock position, where the local ventricular electrogram preceded the onset of the surface QRS complex by 15 ms .\n\n【17】An activation map depicts a non-dilated left atrium with local ventricular activation in the lateral region of the annulus.\n\n【18】删除3：<u>Fig. 17.4\n\n【19】CARTO image in LAO 70° showing the activation map of the left atrium during atrial fibrillation.

This observation and its possible management strategies merit further discussion.\n\n【62】Atrial fibrillation occurs in up to 50% of patients with WPW syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The mechanism of atrial fibrillation in patients with WPW syndrome is different from that of AF in structural heart disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Several hypotheses have been proposed, such as multiple intra-atrial wavefront collision 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>, AP-mediated premature atrial contractions initiating AF in patients with multiple accessory pathways 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>, abnormal electrical impulse circulation due to the presence of atrial double potentials 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>, PVC with retrograde conduction induced AF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>, micro-reentry within the branching networks of the accessory pathway 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, maintenance of atrial reentry by increased structural heterogeneity due to the presence of the AP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>, accessory pathway related atrial refractoriness dispersion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Even though elucidation of the exact mechanism has not yet been accomplished, there is much less ambiguity about its treatment.\n\n【63】The treatment of atrial fibrillation in patients with WPW is ablation of the accessory pathway. This is sufficient in most cases to prevent atrial fibrillation recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>, and no further RF lesion is generally necessary during the ablation procedure. However, in some patients, such as in the above presented case, atrial fibrillation may persist despite successful accessory pathway ablation. The persistence of atrial fibrillation in these cases might be explained by an underlying heart disease causing atrial fibrillation, coexisting with the presence of the AP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Treatment of atrial fibrillation in these cases is not well established, and no consensus currently exists. However, a couple of studies exist in the literature treating this subject. In the experience of Kawabata et al. pulmonary vein isolation in addition to accessory pathway ablation was not associated with a reduced AF recurrence after catheter ablation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. In their population of 96 patients, 64 underwent ablation of the accessory pathway alone and 32 underwent ablation of the accessory pathway + PVI. At follow-up, the recurrence rate of atrial fibrillation did not significantly differ between the two groups (18.8% in the AP ablation + PVI vs. 25% in the AP ablation only, p \\= 0.53). Freedom from AF at 3 months post-catheter ablation was 87.5%, after 1 year 85.5%, and after 5 years 64.6% in the accessory pathway ablation-only group, while in the AP ablation + PVI group it was 90.6% after 3 months, 87.1% after 1 year, and 77.8% after 5 years ( p \\= ns).\n\n【64】In the second study, Wu et al. recently reported their experience with additional PVI in patients who underwent accessory pathway ablation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Compared to patients with WPW syndrome and atrial fibrillation who underwent ablation of the accessory pathway alone, the recurrence rate of atrial fibrillation after additional PVI was not significantly different (15.5% vs 10.5%, respectively; P \\= 0.373). Furthermore, PVI was not associated with the risk of atrial fibrillation recurrence ( H \\= 0.66; 95% CI, 0.26–1.68; P \\= 0.380). Atrial fibrillation recurrence was lower only in those patients who presented advanced inter-atrial block on the surface ECG.\n\n【65】Further studies on larger populations are needed in order to establish the optimal treatment strategy in patients with WPW and atrial fibrillation in whom atrial fibrillation persists after successful catheter ablation of the accessory pathway.\n\n【66】Learning Point\n\n【67】   Atrial fibrillation of patients with WPW is usually related to the presence of the accessory pathway.\n\n【68】   In the majority of cases, ablation of the accessory pathway alone is sufficient for the treatment of atrial fibrillation.\n\n【69】   In the case of AF persistence after successful catheter ablation of the accessory pathway, AF may be non-AP mediated and its treatment should be discussed on a case-by-case basis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 10:58:44", "endTime": "2024/09/14 10:58:55", "cost": 11.629}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:45:58", "update_time": "2024-09-13 18:58:53", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 18:58:41"}

What specialties should be consulted?\n4.  What is the best way to manage emergent hypertension and what dosing would be used?Rationale and Evidence‐based Practice Explanation\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】### Based on the data given, what are the differential diagnoses and the most likely diagnosis for this child?\n\n【22】This teenage patient is presenting with a hypertensive emergency. The differential diagnoses include essential hypertension and secondary hypertension, although secondary hypertension is more likely given the severity of blood pressure elevation. The differential diagnosis of secondary hypertension in children more commonly includes renovascular disease or renal parenchymal disease. Other less prevalent causes of hypertensive emergency in adolescence include secondary hypertension due to aortic coarctation, endocrine conditions such as pheochromocytoma or Cushing disease, or secondary hypertension related to recreational drugs 删除25：<u></u>.\n\n【23】The most likely diagnosis is hypertensive emergency secondary to renal parenchymal disease given the significantly elevated serum creatinine level and distant history of UTI and FTT. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) defines hypertension as a blood pressure ≥95th percentile for age, height, and sex, or above 130/80 mmHg for children 13 years and older. Primary or essential hypertension is hypertension without a known etiology and is the most prevalent cause of hypertension is children over 6 years old. Secondary hypertension means that there is an underlying cause for the hypertension (cardiac, renal, endocrine, neurologic, vascular, ingestions, etc.). Hypertensive emergency is defined as hypertension with end‐organ damage (abnormalities in the heart, eyes, kidneys and/or brain). Prompt recognition and treatment of hypertensive emergency is critical in order to avoid further end‐organ damage. Treatment of hypertensive emergency should be targeted at gradually reducing mean arterial pressure by no more than 25% in the first hour and then gradually over the next 24–48 hours.\n\n【24】Table 94.4 Causes of hypertension related to age.\n\n| Age group | Cause of hypertension | Associated findings |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Newborn | Renal: anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract, vascular stenosis, thrombosis | Elevated serum creatinine, abnormalities on ultrasound |\n|  | Cardiac: coarctation of the aorta | Discrepant four‐extremity blood pressures/perfusion |\n|  | Endocrine: primary hyperaldosteronism, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, pheochromocytoma, Cushing disease | Tachycardia, palpitations, sweating, elevated serum cortisol levels |\n| Preschool through age 6 years | Renal: congenital anomalies of kidneys and urinary tract, renal parenchymal disease, vascular stenosis, thrombosis | Elevated serum creatinine, abnormalities on ultrasound |\n|  | Cardiac: coarctation of the aorta | Discrepant four‐extremity blood pressures/perfusion |\n|  | Enodcrine: pheochromocytoma, Cushing disease | Tachycardia, palpitations, sweating, elevated serum cortisol levels |\n| School age (6–10 years) | Essential hypertension | Obesity + family history |\n|  | Renal: congenital anomalies of kidneys and urinary tract, renal parenchymal disease, vascular stenosis, thrombosis | Elevated serum creatinine, abnormalities on ultrasound |\n|  | Enodcrine: pheochromocytoma, Cushing disease | Tachycardia, palpitations, sweating, elevated serum cortisol levels |\n| Adolescence | Essential hypertension | Obesity + family history |\n|  | Renal: congenital anomalies of kidneys and urinary tract, renal parenchymal disease, vascular stenosis, thrombosis | Elevated serum creatinine, abnormalities on ultrasound |\n|  | Medications and recreational drugs: stimulants, oral contraceptives, corticosteroids, cocaine, amphetamines | Symptoms are related to medication or drug of exposure |\n|  | Endocrine: pheochromocytoma, Cushing disease | Tachycardia, palpitations, sweating, elevated serum cortisol levels |\n\n【26】Obtaining a detailed history and physical examination will help guide the hypertension evaluation. Physical examination should include height, weight, calculated BMI, and percentiles for age. Children with chronic illness often have impaired growth, while obesity is associated with primary hypertension. With stage II hypertension, or systolic blood pressure ≥95th percentile + 12 mmHg or ≥140/90 mmHg (whichever is lower), physical examination should include both upper extremity blood pressure measurements and one leg blood pressure measurement to evaluate for aortic coarctation.\n\n【27】### Would any other diagnostic studies be recommended?\n\n【28】Work‐up for hypertension includes tests to evaluate for secondary causes as well as to look for target organ damage. The work‐up should be guided by the age of the patient, the severity of hypertension, associated comorbid conditions, and findings on history and physical examination. General work‐up typically includes a urinalysis, comprehensive metabolic panel, and renal ultrasound with Doppler. Additional work‐up may include complete blood count, thyroid studies, metanephrines, additional imaging of the renal vasculature such as CT or magnetic resonance angiogram, and sleep study based on the individual patient. An eye examination and echocardiogram can help to evaluate for end‐organ damage from hypertension. In this case study, renal/bladder ultrasound was obtained later and confirmed the diagnosis of hypertensive emergency secondary to renal parenchymal disease as it showed small echogenic kidneys with bilateral hydroureteronephrosis and thickened bladder wall. He was diagnosed with end‐stage kidney disease due to congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract.\n\n【29】The AAP 2017 high blood pressure guidelines recommend obtaining a renal ultrasound for children less than 6 years of age or those (regardless of age) with abnormal urinalysis or renal function. Renal parenchymal disease combined with renal vascular disease account for 63–74% of secondary hypertension in children and adolescents.\n\n【30】### What specialties should be consulted?\n\n【31】Specialty consultation is recommended for pediatric patients presenting with stage II hypertension. Nephrology and cardiology are both specialty services that manage hypertension. Depending on the suspected etiology, one service may be consulted preferentially over the other. With vision disturbance and concern for target organ damage, an ophthalmology consultation is also recommended.\n\n【32】### What is the best way to manage emergent hypertension and what dosing would be used?\n\n【33】Recommended management for hypertensive emergency is aimed at reducing further end‐organ damage by decreasing blood pressure by no more than 25% in the first hour, with gradual reduction over the next 24–48 hours. Lowering blood pressure is done gradually as the vascular beds have accommodated to the current high pressure and lowering too quickly will cause hypoperfusion and ischemic injury. This can best be accomplished in the pediatric intensive care unit by a continuous infusion of a calcium channel blocker or beta‐blocker with close observation often requiring intra‐arterial blood pressure monitoring.

What specialties should be consulted?\n4.  What is the best way to manage emergent hypertension and what dosing would be used?Rationale and Evidence‐based Practice Explanation\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】### Based on the data given, what are the differential diagnoses and the most likely diagnosis for this child?\n\n【22】This teenage patient is presenting with a hypertensive emergency. The differential diagnoses include essential hypertension and secondary hypertension, although secondary hypertension is more likely given the severity of blood pressure elevation. The differential diagnosis of secondary hypertension in children more commonly includes renovascular disease or renal parenchymal disease. Other less prevalent causes of hypertensive emergency in adolescence include secondary hypertension due to aortic coarctation, endocrine conditions such as pheochromocytoma or Cushing disease, or secondary hypertension related to recreational drugs 删除25：<u></u>.\n\n【23】The most likely diagnosis is hypertensive emergency secondary to renal parenchymal disease given the significantly elevated serum creatinine level and distant history of UTI and FTT. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) defines hypertension as a blood pressure ≥95th percentile for age, height, and sex, or above 130/80 mmHg for children 13 years and older. Primary or essential hypertension is hypertension without a known etiology and is the most prevalent cause of hypertension is children over 6 years old. Secondary hypertension means that there is an underlying cause for the hypertension (cardiac, renal, endocrine, neurologic, vascular, ingestions, etc.). Hypertensive emergency is defined as hypertension with end‐organ damage (abnormalities in the heart, eyes, kidneys and/or brain). Prompt recognition and treatment of hypertensive emergency is critical in order to avoid further end‐organ damage. Treatment of hypertensive emergency should be targeted at gradually reducing mean arterial pressure by no more than 25% in the first hour and then gradually over the next 24–48 hours.\n\n【24】Table 94.4 Causes of hypertension related to age.\n\n| Age group | Cause of hypertension | Associated findings |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Newborn | Renal: anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract, vascular stenosis, thrombosis | Elevated serum creatinine, abnormalities on ultrasound |\n|  | Cardiac: coarctation of the aorta | Discrepant four‐extremity blood pressures/perfusion |\n|  | Endocrine: primary hyperaldosteronism, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, pheochromocytoma, Cushing disease | Tachycardia, palpitations, sweating, elevated serum cortisol levels |\n| Preschool through age 6 years | Renal: congenital anomalies of kidneys and urinary tract, renal parenchymal disease, vascular stenosis, thrombosis | Elevated serum creatinine, abnormalities on ultrasound |\n|  | Cardiac: coarctation of the aorta | Discrepant four‐extremity blood pressures/perfusion |\n|  | Enodcrine: pheochromocytoma, Cushing disease | Tachycardia, palpitations, sweating, elevated serum cortisol levels |\n| School age (6–10 years) | Essential hypertension | Obesity + family history |\n|  | Renal: congenital anomalies of kidneys and urinary tract, renal parenchymal disease, vascular stenosis, thrombosis | Elevated serum creatinine, abnormalities on ultrasound |\n|  | Enodcrine: pheochromocytoma, Cushing disease | Tachycardia, palpitations, sweating, elevated serum cortisol levels |\n| Adolescence | Essential hypertension | Obesity + family history |\n|  | Renal: congenital anomalies of kidneys and urinary tract, renal parenchymal disease, vascular stenosis, thrombosis | Elevated serum creatinine, abnormalities on ultrasound |\n|  | Medications and recreational drugs: stimulants, oral contraceptives, corticosteroids, cocaine, amphetamines | Symptoms are related to medication or drug of exposure |\n|  | Endocrine: pheochromocytoma, Cushing disease | Tachycardia, palpitations, sweating, elevated serum cortisol levels |\n\n【26】Obtaining a detailed history and physical examination will help guide the hypertension evaluation. Physical examination should include height, weight, calculated BMI, and percentiles for age. Children with chronic illness often have impaired growth, while obesity is associated with primary hypertension. With stage II hypertension, or systolic blood pressure ≥95th percentile + 12 mmHg or ≥140/90 mmHg (whichever is lower), physical examination should include both upper extremity blood pressure measurements and one leg blood pressure measurement to evaluate for aortic coarctation.\n\n【27】### Would any other diagnostic studies be recommended?\n\n【28】Work‐up for hypertension includes tests to evaluate for secondary causes as well as to look for target organ damage. The work‐up should be guided by the age of the patient, the severity of hypertension, associated comorbid conditions, and findings on history and physical examination. General work‐up typically includes a urinalysis, comprehensive metabolic panel, and renal ultrasound with Doppler. Additional work‐up may include complete blood count, thyroid studies, metanephrines, additional imaging of the renal vasculature such as CT or magnetic resonance angiogram, and sleep study based on the individual patient. An eye examination and echocardiogram can help to evaluate for end‐organ damage from hypertension. In this case study, renal/bladder ultrasound was obtained later and confirmed the diagnosis of hypertensive emergency secondary to renal parenchymal disease as it showed small echogenic kidneys with bilateral hydroureteronephrosis and thickened bladder wall. He was diagnosed with end‐stage kidney disease due to congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract.\n\n【29】The AAP 2017 high blood pressure guidelines recommend obtaining a renal ultrasound for children less than 6 years of age or those (regardless of age) with abnormal urinalysis or renal function. Renal parenchymal disease combined with renal vascular disease account for 63–74% of secondary hypertension in children and adolescents.\n\n【30】### What specialties should be consulted?\n\n【31】Specialty consultation is recommended for pediatric patients presenting with stage II hypertension. Nephrology and cardiology are both specialty services that manage hypertension. Depending on the suspected etiology, one service may be consulted preferentially over the other. With vision disturbance and concern for target organ damage, an ophthalmology consultation is also recommended.\n\n【32】### What is the best way to manage emergent hypertension and what dosing would be used?\n\n【33】Recommended management for hypertensive emergency is aimed at reducing further end‐organ damage by decreasing blood pressure by no more than 25% in the first hour, with gradual reduction over the next 24–48 hours. Lowering blood pressure is done gradually as the vascular beds have accommodated to the current high pressure and lowering too quickly will cause hypoperfusion and ischemic injury. This can best be accomplished in the pediatric intensive care unit by a continuous infusion of a calcium channel blocker or beta‐blocker with close observation often requiring intra‐arterial blood pressure monitoring. In addition to the goal of reducing blood pressure, it is also important to plan for supportive care for potential life‐threatening complications such as seizures.\n\n【34】Medications used in a hypertensive crisis include the following.\n\n【35】   Calcium channel blocker: nicardipine 1–3 μg/kg per min.\n   Beta‐blocker: esmolol 125–500 μg/kg per min or labetalol 0.25–3 mg/kg per hour.\n   Direct vasodilator: diazoxide 1–3 mg/kg every 5–15 minutes or hydralazine 0.2–0.6 mg/kg bolus.\n\n【36】Longer‐term initial management of hypertension includes pharmacologic therapy with an angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, long‐acting calcium channel blocker, or a thiazide diuretic. Beta‐blockers are not recommended as first‐line treatment based on adverse effects and adult data that there is a lack of effect with these agents.

Davies\n\n【2】#### The Case\n\n【3】> Sarah is a 32-year-old, gravida 1, para 0 in active labor at 4 cm cervical dilatation. She is experiencing considerable pain and requests an epidural for analgesia. However, as the anesthesiologist arrives, the patient’s husband, Tom, is telling the nurse that, prior to labor, his wife specifically told him that she did not want an epidural for pain, even if she begged for one, and he should not let her change her mind. This information is also written in her birth plan. Sarah is now screaming with each contraction and, despite receiving a total of 150 mcg of intravenous fentanyl, is adamant that she wants an epidural “now.”\n\n【4】Principle-based medical ethics focuses on the four concepts of autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence and justice. Over time, there has been movement from the beneficence driven paternalism of “doctor knows best” towards increasing patient autonomy. Authentic patient autonomy requires that the patients make their own decisions after they have received all of the relevant information pertinent to their situation and are therefore fully informed. Informed consent requires several elements: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> capacity of the patient to make a decision, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> freedom or voluntariness of the patient in decision-making, 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> disclosure of adequate information to the patient, 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> understanding of that information by the patient, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> consent by the patient to the procedure. Ensuring that these elements have been addressed and obtaining consent for procedures in laboring patients can be extremely challenging.\n\n【5】##### Can informed consent be obtained during the pain of labor?\n\n【6】There are conflicting views on whether informed consent is even possible during active labor. Black and Cyna, analyzed responses from 291 anesthesiologists surveyed about the risks they discussed with laboring patients, and whether it was possible to gain fully informed consent from them.通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>1 </sup></u> Seventy percent considered active labor a barrier to the ability of a woman to give consent. However, a Society of Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology Anesthesiologists (SOAP) survey, published the same year 通用删除7(英):<u>(2006)</u>, found that 68% of 448 anesthesiologists thought that women in active labor are able to give informed consent.通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>2 </sup></u> Scott has gone so far as to say “the only time when consent to an epidural to relieve the pain of labor is truly informed is in labor itself … when the person concerned knows what the pain is like.” <sup>3</sup>\n\n【7】Several studies of the patient’s perspective of informed consent during labor show that the pain of labor does not appear to interfere with the patient’s ability to hear and comprehend the information relevant to consent.通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>4 </sup></u> Furthermore, a woman’s ability to understand epidural risks does not correlate with level of labor pain, anxiety, duration of pain, opioid medication, previous epidural experience or the desire for an epidural.通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>5 </sup></u> In fact, the ability to recall the risks has been found to be similar in both laboring and nonlaboring, nonobstetric patients.通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>6 </sup></u> Ideally, written or visual information about labor analgesia should be provided or at least available during prenatal visits to the obstetrician’s office in the antenatal period or during early labor allowing time for consideration of the available options and any questions.\n\n【8】Is Sarah’s consent impeded by the fentanyl she has received? In general the answer is poorly addressed in the literature. There are no US legal precedents regarding this issue and most institutions have inconsistent policies. Anesthesiologists can and do routinely make judgments about a patient’s capacity for informed consent based on the elements described above. There is normally no need to contact a psychiatrist or obtain legal advice. Sarah must have the mental capacity to comprehend and participate in the consent process and analgesia may allow her to do this. Withholding appropriate analgesia, particularly if there is a delay in the anesthesiologist obtaining consent, may in itself put the anesthesiologist in an unsupportable ethical position.\n\n【9】##### Ulysses directives\n\n【10】At this stage in her care, the literature supports that Sarah, despite being in severe pain and having received fentanyl, should be able to provide fully informed consent for epidural placement. However, an additional ethical dilemma has developed. Sarah’s husband, Tom, is insistent that Sarah does not really want an epidural and produces a written birthing plan which includes a statement that Sarah does not want to be permitted to deviate from this plan or her wishes concerning an epidural. Such a document is known as a “Ulysses directive” and brings into conflict the anesthesiologist’s beneficent desire to provide Sarah with analgesia, and the wish to respect Sarah’s autonomous decision to have a “natural” delivery.\n\n【11】However, autonomous decision-making brings with it the privilege for a woman to change her mind, especially if she has never experienced the pain of childbirth before. One might argue that Sarah’s directive be considered invalid because it was made at a time when the she was not fully informed. Antenatally, she may have been determined not to have an epidural. However, she may not have received appropriate information regarding the risks and benefits of epidurals, nor had she experienced labor pain previously. Information and valid experience are critical prerequisites for autonomous decision-making. While Scott considers it unethical “to withhold pain relief from a greatly distressed woman … solely because of a statement written in her birth plan.”, Thornton and Moore have argued that this “… does not respect her long-term preferences”, and hence her autonomy.”通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>7 </sup></u> Other authors have even postulated that the duty of beneficence (in this case to relieve pain) may allow an intervention to proceed in the absence of informed consent until evidence of patient refusal is forthcoming.通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>8 </sup></u> In this instance there is no unequivocal ethical ground upon which to stand and it has been suggested that the anesthesiologist be guided by the circumstances.\nSarah is a primiparous woman at 4 cm cervical dilatation and is likely to be in labor for many more hours. Placing an epidural for analgesia is certainly an ethically defensible decision in this case. Interestingly, frequently it is the legal ramifications rather than the ethical debate that cause anesthesiologists the most concern. As a woman with capacity, Sarah can legally overrule her birth plan at any point. However, there is a risk after delivery, when the pain is long gone, that Sarah might feel she somehow “failed” during the birthing process by agreeing to have an epidural and see the anesthesiologist as an accomplice in this failure. This could result in an accusation of assault, or unconsented touching of the patient.\n\n【12】The anesthesiologist should be encouraged to see the patient and her family postpartum. At that time the anesthesiologist can discuss the events and reassure the patient that her decision was the correct one for the circumstances in which she found herself. It may help to inform the patient that relief of pain and stress during labor has benefits for the fetus and the course of labor. It is also wise to document the decision-making process that occurred. An example chart note might read:\n\n【13】> After an appropriate consent process, the patient has decided to withdraw her previous refusal of epidural analgesia for labor. I will proceed based on her currently stated request for epidural analgesia.\n\n【14】In this particular case the ethical tension was resolved when the anesthesiologist conducted a patient and lengthy discussion with both Tom and Sarah. They agreed that they may not have appreciated how painful the labor would be, that an epidural would allow Sarah to enjoy the birth more, and that perhaps they had been naïve in her inexperience to completely refuse to consider all of her analgesic options.\n\n【15】#### How much information is enough?\n\n【16】How much information is too much and how long a discussion is too long during the throws of active labor? The amount of information given to Sarah regarding the risks and benefits of an epidural needs to be balanced against her level of pain and urgency to proceed. If possible, discussions should be held between contractions when the woman can focus on what she is being told. It is prudent to have this conversation with the patient’s support person present. Tom, in this case, will be able to ask questions and witness that the information has been provided. Every anesthesiologist has their own routine when providing information to a patient during the consent process. Brooks and Sullivan have aided the practitioner by developing a list of recommended issues that should be discussed with the patient.通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>10 </sup></u> This list includes:\n\n【17】通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> benefits of the epidural to the mother, i.e. excellent pain relief;\n\n【18】通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> potential beneficial effects of an epidural on the baby and labor;\n\n【19】通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> risks of epidurals, such as epidural failure, side effects, and rare but serious risks;\n\n【20】通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> information relevant to the individual patient, e.g. the effect of an epidural on preexisting medical conditions she may already have, e.g. chronic back pain or neurological disease;\n\n【21】通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> alternatives for analgesia and any further information requested by the patient.\n\n【22】##### Which risks should be disclosed?\n\n【23】As is frequently the case, Sarah does not wish to hear a lot of details about the procedure and urges the anesthesiologist to “just get on with it.” While being flexible in the approach to providing information under these conditions, it is imperative that the anesthesiologist cover the risks of the procedure. There is no universal standard of care when disclosing risks associated with an epidural to obtain informed consent, although different rules have been proposed. Several studies have found that the majority of women want to hear all the risks associated with regional anesthesia, particularly those that occur commonly but are less severe, and those which are rare but could be serious or life-threatening.\n##### Should informed consent be written or verbal?\n\n【24】There is no consensus about whether it is better to have patients sign consents or, simply verbally consent: both are ethically and legally acceptable in many states. Documentation of this discussion can include either a separate anesthesia consent form signed by the patient or a detailed note in the patient’s chart verifying verbal consent.\n\n【25】##### Is informed consent during labor a liability issue?\n\n【26】Knapp examined three legal cases that addressed the issue of adequacy of informed consent during labor. In every instance the cases were found in favor of the defending anesthesiologist because the courts felt there was not only evidence of “reasonable” information having been provided to the patients but also, the patients had not objected to, and in fact, had actively cooperated with the procedure.\n#### Case 2: Refusal to consent to treatment\n\n【27】> Fatima is a non-English speaking, 19-year-old, gravida 2, para 1, Somalian Muslim married to 40-year-old Mohammed. It is 3:00 am. Because of the hour there is no formal Somali interpreter available so Mohammed has been providing interpretation. Fatima has been in labor for more than 20 hours with slow progress. She is at 9 cm cervical dilatation and the fetus is showing signs of distress with severe variable heart rate decelerations into the 60s. The obstetricians want to perform an urgent cesarean section but Mohammed is refusing, despite being told that the baby could die if surgery is delayed. In spite of his refusal for surgery Fatima continues to say that she wants her baby to be delivered safely. There is concern that Mohammed is not giving his wife the correct information or providing the practitioners with an adequate representation of Fatima’s wishes .\n\n【28】Frequently, such dilemmas are resolved by further discussion regarding the risks and benefits of the Cesarean section, understanding the fears of surgery that the patient brings to the table, and gentle persuasion as to the best course of action to gain the consent of the husband to proceed. However, that is not always the result. There are several ethical issues that must be considered in this situation. The first is that of “maternal–fetal conflict,” also discussed in Chapter 8 , under “CDMR from the Fetus’s Perspective.”", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "3", "content": "【0】### 7 Consent in laboring patients\n\n【1】Joanna M.

While Scott considers it unethical “to withhold pain relief from a greatly distressed woman … solely because of a statement written in her birth plan.”, Thornton and Moore have argued that this “… does not respect her long-term preferences”, and hence her autonomy.”通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>7 </sup></u> Other authors have even postulated that the duty of beneficence (in this case to relieve pain) may allow an intervention to proceed in the absence of informed consent until evidence of patient refusal is forthcoming.通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>8 </sup></u> In this instance there is no unequivocal ethical ground upon which to stand and it has been suggested that the anesthesiologist be guided by the circumstances.\nSarah is a primiparous woman at 4 cm cervical dilatation and is likely to be in labor for many more hours. Placing an epidural for analgesia is certainly an ethically defensible decision in this case. Interestingly, frequently it is the legal ramifications rather than the ethical debate that cause anesthesiologists the most concern. As a woman with capacity, Sarah can legally overrule her birth plan at any point. However, there is a risk after delivery, when the pain is long gone, that Sarah might feel she somehow “failed” during the birthing process by agreeing to have an epidural and see the anesthesiologist as an accomplice in this failure. This could result in an accusation of assault, or unconsented touching of the patient.\n\n【12】The anesthesiologist should be encouraged to see the patient and her family postpartum. At that time the anesthesiologist can discuss the events and reassure the patient that her decision was the correct one for the circumstances in which she found herself. It may help to inform the patient that relief of pain and stress during labor has benefits for the fetus and the course of labor. It is also wise to document the decision-making process that occurred. An example chart note might read:\n\n【13】> After an appropriate consent process, the patient has decided to withdraw her previous refusal of epidural analgesia for labor. I will proceed based on her currently stated request for epidural analgesia.\n\n【14】In this particular case the ethical tension was resolved when the anesthesiologist conducted a patient and lengthy discussion with both Tom and Sarah. They agreed that they may not have appreciated how painful the labor would be, that an epidural would allow Sarah to enjoy the birth more, and that perhaps they had been naïve in her inexperience to completely refuse to consider all of her analgesic options.\n\n【15】#### How much information is enough?\n\n【16】How much information is too much and how long a discussion is too long during the throws of active labor? The amount of information given to Sarah regarding the risks and benefits of an epidural needs to be balanced against her level of pain and urgency to proceed. If possible, discussions should be held between contractions when the woman can focus on what she is being told. It is prudent to have this conversation with the patient’s support person present. Tom, in this case, will be able to ask questions and witness that the information has been provided. Every anesthesiologist has their own routine when providing information to a patient during the consent process. Brooks and Sullivan have aided the practitioner by developing a list of recommended issues that should be discussed with the patient.通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>10 </sup></u> This list includes:\n\n【17】通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> benefits of the epidural to the mother, i.e. excellent pain relief;\n\n【18】通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> potential beneficial effects of an epidural on the baby and labor;\n\n【19】通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> risks of epidurals, such as epidural failure, side effects, and rare but serious risks;\n\n【20】通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> information relevant to the individual patient, e.g. the effect of an epidural on preexisting medical conditions she may already have, e.g. chronic back pain or neurological disease;\n\n【21】通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> alternatives for analgesia and any further information requested by the patient.\n\n【22】##### Which risks should be disclosed?\n\n【23】As is frequently the case, Sarah does not wish to hear a lot of details about the procedure and urges the anesthesiologist to “just get on with it.” While being flexible in the approach to providing information under these conditions, it is imperative that the anesthesiologist cover the risks of the procedure. There is no universal standard of care when disclosing risks associated with an epidural to obtain informed consent, although different rules have been proposed. Several studies have found that the majority of women want to hear all the risks associated with regional anesthesia, particularly those that occur commonly but are less severe, and those which are rare but could be serious or life-threatening.\n##### Should informed consent be written or verbal?\n\n【24】There is no consensus about whether it is better to have patients sign consents or, simply verbally consent: both are ethically and legally acceptable in many states. Documentation of this discussion can include either a separate anesthesia consent form signed by the patient or a detailed note in the patient’s chart verifying verbal consent.\n\n【25】##### Is informed consent during labor a liability issue?\n\n【26】Knapp examined three legal cases that addressed the issue of adequacy of informed consent during labor. In every instance the cases were found in favor of the defending anesthesiologist because the courts felt there was not only evidence of “reasonable” information having been provided to the patients but also, the patients had not objected to, and in fact, had actively cooperated with the procedure.\n#### Case 2: Refusal to consent to treatment\n\n【27】> Fatima is a non-English speaking, 19-year-old, gravida 2, para 1, Somalian Muslim married to 40-year-old Mohammed. It is 3:00 am. Because of the hour there is no formal Somali interpreter available so Mohammed has been providing interpretation. Fatima has been in labor for more than 20 hours with slow progress. She is at 9 cm cervical dilatation and the fetus is showing signs of distress with severe variable heart rate decelerations into the 60s. The obstetricians want to perform an urgent cesarean section but Mohammed is refusing, despite being told that the baby could die if surgery is delayed. In spite of his refusal for surgery Fatima continues to say that she wants her baby to be delivered safely. There is concern that Mohammed is not giving his wife the correct information or providing the practitioners with an adequate representation of Fatima’s wishes .\n\n【28】Frequently, such dilemmas are resolved by further discussion regarding the risks and benefits of the Cesarean section, understanding the fears of surgery that the patient brings to the table, and gentle persuasion as to the best course of action to gain the consent of the husband to proceed. However, that is not always the result. There are several ethical issues that must be considered in this situation. The first is that of “maternal–fetal conflict,” also discussed in Chapter 8 , under “CDMR from the Fetus’s Perspective.”", "index": 2670, "show": true, "start": 2670, "end": 2671, "comment": "6", "isEdit": false, "province": ["文本干净度", "页码/数字"]}], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:28:41", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:29:30", "cost": 48.566}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:45:58", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:29:30", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:28:40"}

Even though the definition of the compulsions requires that they are aimed at preventing or reducing anxiety/distress or preventing a dreaded outcome, young children may be unaware of or unable to articulate this function of their compulsions 删除10：<u>(APA 2013 )</u>. Approximately 80 % of OCD cases have a pediatric onset 删除10：<u>(Riddle 1998 )</u> with point-prevalence rates for pediatric OCD ranging from 1 to 42 % 删除10：<u>(Zohar et al. 1997 )</u>. Pediatric OCD is more common in males than females and likely to be comorbid with tics and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder 删除10：<u>(ADHD; Kalra and Swedo 2009 )</u>.\n\n【10】The content of the obsessions and compulsions varies considerably among patients with OCD with factor-analytic studies suggesting the presence of up to five separate obsessive-compulsive dimensions 删除10：<u>(Leckman et al. 1997 ; Mataix-Cols et al. 2005 ; Stewart et al. 2007 )</u>. This chapter focuses on the symmetry dimension of OCD, keeping in mind that the symptoms of pediatric OCD are heterogeneous 删除10：<u>(Mataix-Cols et al. 2005 ; Rettew et al. 1992 )</u>, and individuals may present with symptoms consistent with more than one dimension. Children displaying symptoms within the symmetry dimension often have obsessions about things being symmetrical, perfect, or “right.” As a result of this need for symmetry, children may repeat tasks until they are perfect or “just right,” perform acts in a symmetrical manner as to “even out,” engage in compulsions of putting things in a certain order, or engage in counting compulsions. Individuals with symmetry OCD also have a higher rate of the compulsive need to touch, tap, or rub, and “fear of not saying just the right thing” (Leckman et al. 1997 , p. 914). These compulsions are oftentimes time-consuming and may lead to considerable impairment, such as being late due to lengthy morning routines involving matching, evening out, and/or repetitive actions. Symmetry OCD is more common in males than females and is more commonly comorbid with tic disorders than other OCD dimensions 删除10：<u>(Leckman et al. 1997 ; Mataix-Cols et al. 2005 ; Storch et al. 2008c )</u>, with younger children exhibiting greater “just not right” and other symmetry compulsions (e.g. touching, tapping, repeating) than older cohorts 删除10：<u>(Garcia et al. 2009 )</u>.\n\n【11】Evidence-Based Treatments for Pediatric OCD\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【12】Pediatric OCD can be quite debilitating for the child as well as the family; therefore, it is important for children with OCD to receive effective treatment for their symptoms. The gold standard treatment for OCD in both adults and children is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) with exposure and response prevention (ERP) either alone or in combination with pharmacotherapy 删除10：<u>(AACAP 2012 ; Lewin and Piacentini 2009 )</u>. The Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry 删除10：<u>(AACAP; 2012 )</u> practice parameters recommend using a combination of pharmacotherapy and CBT for older children and adolescents and with individuals who experience moderate-to-severe OCD, while CBT alone is recommended to be more appropriate for use with younger children and with iOCD of mild-to-moderate severity 删除10：<u>(AACAP 2012 )</u>. Further, combined treatment (pharmacotherapy inclusive) may not always be considered an acceptable approach for parents 删除10：<u>(Stevens et al. 2009 )</u>, with parents demonstrating preference for CBT over pharmacotherapy 删除10：<u>(Lewin et al. 2014 )</u>.\n\n【13】ERP, the primary component of exposure-based CBT for OCD, aims at identifying the child’s triggers for obsessions and compulsions and creating a hierarchy of feared situations that can be practiced in and outside of therapy sessions 删除10：<u>(March and Mulle 1998 )</u>. As part of ERP, the child is exposed to the triggering stimuli or situations but is prevented from carrying out the compulsions, with repeated exposures leading to habituation to associated anxiety and discomfort 删除10：<u>(Bouton 2004 ; Jordan et al. 2012 )</u>. Exposure-based CBT has been shown to be superior to placebo 删除10：<u>(POTS 2004 )</u>, attention-control conditions 删除10：<u>(Freeman et al. 2008 ; Piacentini et al. 2011 )</u>, and in some studies, antidepressant medications 删除10：<u>(POTS 2004 ; POTS-II 2011 ; Storch et al. 2013 )</u>.\n\n【14】Factors for Consideration with Treatment of Younger Children\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】Factors such as family functioning and accommodation 删除10：<u>(Storch et al. 2007a ; Rapee 2012 )</u>, lack of insight and motivation 删除10：<u>(Lewin et al. 2010 ; Selles et al. 2014 ; Storch et al. 2008b )</u>, and associated behavior problems (e.g. anxious oppositional or tantrum behaviors) may also play a significant role in prognosis and treatment response; therefore, as part of ERP-based treatment, these factors must be addressed appropriately. In youth, and especially younger youth, sessions oftentimes are delivered in a family-based format 删除10：<u>(e.g. Barrett et al. 2004 ; Lewin et al. 2014 )</u> to facilitate understanding of treatment principles, recruit the parent as a “coach” outside of sessions, decrease family accommodation 删除10：<u>(i.e. any behavior on behalf of family members that is aimed at decreasing the child’s OCD-related distress, but inadvertently leading to reinforcement of the OCD symptoms; Storch et al. 2007b ; Lewin et al. 2014 )</u>, and help increase the child’s efforts during exposures 删除10：<u>(Lebowitz et al. 2013 ; Rudy et al. 2014 ; Lewin et al. 2014 )</u>. Cognitive components of CBT (e.g. challenging cognitive distortions) may be less appropriate for younger populations due to developmentally appropriate lack of insight and metacognitive abilities, or “thinking about thinking,” 删除10：<u>(Freeman et al. 2008 ; Lewin et al. 2014 ; Kuhn 2000 ; Wellman et al. 2001 )</u>; therefore, a greater emphasis is made on behavioral strategies such as participant modeling, reinforced practice, and contingency management in combination with ERP 删除10：<u>(Lewin et al. 2014 ; May et al. 2013 ; Rudy et al. 2014 )</u>. Provision of external motivation through participant modeling 删除10：<u>(i.e. the child observes another individual interacting with a feared situation or stimulus in a non-fearful way; Bouton 2004 )</u> and reinforced practice 删除10：<u>(i.e. the provision of reinforcement of small gains for participating in exposure activities; Davis and Ollendick 2005 )</u> can be especially helpful 删除10：<u>(Hirshfeld-Becker and Biederman 2002 ; Hirshfeld-Becker et al. 2010 )</u>. Behavior management strategies such as time-out or response cost are also useful for addressing disruptive behaviors that often accompany anxious symptoms 删除10：<u>(i.e. anxious oppositionality; Hirshfeld-Becker and Biederman 2002 ; Hirshfeld-Becker et al. 2010 ; Rudy et al. 2014 )</u>. Thus, with these considerations in mind, the purpose of this chapter is to elucidate how to treat commonly occurring symmetry OCD in a child, aged 7 years, using exposure-based CBT with a heavy emphasis on behavioral strategies and family involvement.\n\n【16】Presenting Problem\n------------------\n\n【17】The following is a case example of a 7-year-old boy, Sam (a pseudonym), with symmetry OCD. Sam’s presenting symptoms were predominately compulsive in nature and included needing to “match” almost every purposeful action with a paired action. He engaged in a large amount of morning, bedtime, and separation (i.e. saying goodbye when separating from significant others in certain ways) rituals which involved his parents and grandparents. As part of these rituals, Sam required his parents to reproduce his actions or motions; for example, repeating words, waving in the same way, or touching objects the same way. The rituals would need to restart, should his parents or he not perform an exact replication of the action/motion. Sam also engaged in other, similar “matching” actions throughout the day. Sam touched or wiped objects (e.g. furniture before sitting, doors before opening) with his right and then his left hand in the same fashion and the same number of times. He counted steps so that his right and left foot took the same amount of steps. He needed to enter and then reenter rooms or use different doors (e.g. car doors, house doors) to even out his actions. Should any of Sam’s rituals, matching, or counting actions be done in a way other than the way he deemed “just right,” he would need to restart the ritual process. According to his parents, morning and separation (e.g. goodbye at preschool) rituals as well as bedtime rituals could last up to 2 + h each day, especially for days that were deemed “bad.” Sam’s parents described a myriad of “matching” behaviors that occurred without warning every day and were cumbersome and time-consuming for Sam and his family. Further, should his parents attempt to stop his ritual or “matching action” or refuse to participate, Sam reportedly engaged in excessive tantrum behaviors (e.g. yelling, crying, hitting, kicking) that lasted up to an hour or more. Given the high level of family involvement and time-consuming nature of the rituals, as well as the disruptive behaviors that occurred in the absence of the rituals, Sam’s compulsions were highly interfering with his own and his family functioning.\n\n【18】Case Information\n----------------\n\n【19】### Background and Psychological History\n\n【20】At the time of the intake session, Sam was a 7-year-old Caucasian/Latino male who was referred by his parents to a university-based anxiety specialty clinic due to significant anxiety and ritualistic behaviors. Sam lived in a suburban community with his biological parents and younger brother. He attended preschool 3 days per week and was cared for by his grandmother in the afternoons and on days that he did not attend school. No developmental delay or deficits in intellectual, language, or adaptive functioning were noted. All milestones were met on time.\n\n【21】Sam’s parents indicated that Sam’s ritualistic behaviors began between ages 3 and 4 years and had increased in severity since that time. Sam’s early rituals and compulsive behaviors included a strict bedtime routine and schedule-dependent sleep, tapping and touching “just right,” texture sensitivities with clothing, and counting and goodbye rituals (e.g. blowing four kisses for each goodbye). His rituals reportedly progressed in number and severity with increasing age. Sam’s parents reported that Sam had previously received a diagnosis of OCD by his pediatrician and had been seen by a licensed professional counselor (LPC) for play therapy for approximately five sessions without benefit. His parents reported that they were not involved in his therapy sessions and did not know the content of the sessions. No other previous assessment or treatment services and no current or previous psychotropic medication use were reported.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:19:46", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:20:29", "cost": 42.821}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:45:58", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:20:26", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:19:43"}

In this section, we will explore self-care strategies for the patient with HF by first understanding the definition of self-care and how the self-care of patients with HF is affected by family/caregiver relationships, cultural influences, and self-efficacy. We will end the section with overall strategies for promoting HF self-care with considerations encompassing these areas listed above.\n\n【2】### 8.5.1 Definition of Self-Care and the Importance of Symptom Monitoring\n\n【3】Self-care has been defined by Riegel et al. as a process that influences one’s actions to maintain physiologic stability, help one to perceive their symptoms of worsening HF, and then manage those symptoms through a treatment regimen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 44 \\]</u>. Self-care has been identified to have 3 separate components that are linked together and necessary to maintain a homeostasis. The first process in self-care is maintenance , which consists of adherence to treatment and behaviors. For example, following the prescribed medication regimen, diet restrictions (i.e. low salt), and performing exercise (i.e. walking) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 44 \\]</u>. The next step in the process of self-care is one being able to perceive their symptoms ( symptom perception ). This involves listening to their body (i.e. pants fitting too tight, shortness of breath when performing activities that do not normally cause shortness of breath, etc.). In addition to perceiving symptom(s), one needs to recognize and interpret it as a problem or not being normal for them and labeling it as such. Lastly, a person with HF needs to perform the final process of self-care, which is management . In the management phase, a person with HF will respond to the symptom.\n\n【4】It is important to note that patients with HF make these decisions about their self-care based on the circumstances occurring, and their environmental elements that influence the problem, such as patient’s decision about what to eat at home may be very different when faced with making this decision in a different environment, surrounded by different support systems. For example, a person may follow a low sodium diet while at home, but they attend a family event where low-sodium foods are not available, so they choose to eat with others and therefore consume a higher sodium diet than normal. This is an example of how normally individuals who are adherent and successful with their HF regimen may fail due to the circumstances that surround them 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 44 \\]</u>. Many times individuals will make decisions about their care based on past experiences with the symptom and treatment of that symptom. However, at times other factors may influence their decision-making such as age-related cognitive decline, comorbid conditions, gender, living situation, and social support. These are all examples that a provider should keep in mind regarding how complicated one’s decision-making can be when performing self-care and ways that we as healthcare providers can support a patient in their self-care process.\n\n【5】### 8.5.2 Role of Family Caregiver with Promoting Self-Care\n\n【6】The care of a patient with HF can occur in many settings, such as the outpatient clinic, provider’s office, or in a hospital setting. However, the actual maintenance and management of these patients occur in their home by themselves or with family caregivers. Since the patient spends most of their time managing their condition of HF in the home, it is important to assess the contributory factors to being successful or not with their self-care in a home setting. This section will examine the role of the family caregiver as it pertains to HF self-care, as well as the impact that the caregiver can have on the patient with actually performing their self-care.\n\n【7】Caregivers help patients with their medication management, dietary restrictions, schedule appointments, watch for and report untoward symptoms such as edema and/or shortness of breath, and daily weighing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 45 \\]</u>. They may also help the patient with calling their provider when necessary and assist with titrating their diuretic or other medications as directed, essentially serving to interface between the patient and clinicians. Given the ways that caregivers help with all aspects of self-care, it is easy to see how they can play an important role in positively or negatively affecting patients with regard to performance of their self-care behaviors. Family theory and research can provide some helpful information on the importance of the role that family caregivers have on patients who are managing their condition of HF.\n\n【8】The way a family communicates and adapts to and solves problems can affect the patient’s ability to adhere to their self-care regimen. One theory that explains the interactions between family and a patient with a chronic illness such as HF is the Self-Determination Theory (SDT), which is a theory of motivation. Motivation to perform self-care is an essential factor for achieving behavioral change 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 46 \\]</u>. There are two types of motivation described by SDT, which are autonomous and controlled regulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 46 , 47 \\]</u>. Autonomous regulation occurs when a person performs the behavior because they value it and feel that they have the ability to integrate it into their daily living whereas controlled regulation occurs when a person with HF performs the behavior because they feel pressured by another person, which could be verbally (e.g. “you should”) or by being made to feel guilty for not performing the behavior 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 48 , 49 \\]</u>. Prior studies using interventions to underpin the SDT theory have shown that caregivers who provide autonomous support to patients with HF tend to have higher levels of adherence to their low sodium diets and medication adherence with higher motivation and confidence to perform their self-care 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 50 , 51 \\]</u>. Also, caregivers mood can affect a patient with HF’s motivation to perform self-care maintenance. Patients who had caregivers with higher levels of depression and anxiety had worse self-care maintenance and at times could effect a patient’s engagement in their self-care and self-efficacy for performing self-care 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 52 \\]</u>.\n\n【9】Educational interventions which include the family member/caregiver with the patient have more positive, sustained effects than those that only include education of the patient with HF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 50 , 51 , 53 , 54 \\]</u>. Therefore, healthcare providers should include family members in education related to care of the HF patient and help the family member understand how providing supportive, autonomous communication to the patient can promote successful outcomes.\n\n【10】### 8.5.3 Cultural Influences of Self-Care\n\n【11】Person-related factors such as culture and ethnicity can play a role in one performing their recommended self-care regimen. Prior studies have been completed to evaluate the influence of cultural beliefs and practices on performing self-care behaviors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 55 – 60 \\]</u>. Providers need to consider a person’s cultural beliefs when providing self-care education so they can help tailor the education and self-care practices to be sustainable within a person’s way of life.\n\n【12】### 8.5.4 Health Literacy, Self-Care Education, and Self-Efficacy\n\n【13】HF self-care education can improve patient’s knowledge to learn the skills necessary to manage this progressive, chronic condition. With knowledge comes empowerment and a feeling of personal control and confidence to manage the symptoms of their disease. However, knowledge alone without providing patients and caregivers with the necessary skills, strategies, and support to make lifestyle changes can result in failure for the patient leading to decreased self-efficacy for managing their condition. It is beneficial for HF patients to receive specialized education and training in self-management (medication management, nutrition, exercise) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 61 \\]</u>. However, education in the presence of low health literacy can lead to poor outcomes such as nonadherence to performing self-care behaviors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 62 \\]</u>. Prior research has found that there are levels of health literacy. One is critical health literacy, which is the ability to critically analyze information provided and use that information to make decisions about self-care. When a person has low levels of critical health literacy it has been shown to be an independent predictor of patients performing fewer self-care behaviors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 62 \\]</u>. Providing educational interventions about symptom management, perception, and maintenance is one way to improve health literacy, self-efficacy, and self-care confidence for performing self-care in patients with HF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 63 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】### 8.5.5 Overall Self-Care Strategies for Managing a Patient with Heart Failure\n\n【15】Patients with HF vary in their ability to perform self-care 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 64 \\]</u>. However, there are some factors that can facilitate or serve as barriers to patients being successful with following their regimen and monitoring their status. Some of the things that providers can consider when working with patients who have HF is to recognize that one of the main barriers to taking diuretics is the fear that they will have an accident when outside of the house or the side effect of getting up to go to the bathroom all night and lacking sleep. In many cases this can lead to patients skipping their dose and having worsening symptoms. Providers can mitigate this barrier by educating the patients about strategies regarding when to take their diuretic so that it does not interfere in their daily life. For instance, recommend that they plan ahead and take their diuretic at least a few hours before leaving the house so that most of their diuresis will have subsided before outside activities begin. Second, to schedule their diuretic no later than 5–6 p.m. in the evening so going to the bathroom frequently won’t interfere with their sleep.\n\n【16】A barrier to weighing themselves daily or monitoring for swelling was forgetfulness. Providers can educate their patients with HF to make weekly diaries and place the diary somewhere they will see it every day. Ask them to write their weight down so they can see the trend of weight loss or gain. In addition, we know through prior research that patients have a difficult time assessing edema. Talk with them about things they can measure, such as whether their pants, socks, pantyhose, or shoes become tighter than normal or their clothing is fitting more tightly than normal. Hand your patient written instructions that they can refer to often because they tend to forget what is said during the office visit. Following a low-sodium diet is often difficult for patients with HF especially when they eat out or want to attend social events. In the case of attending social events talk with them about that it is okay to eat before they go so the temptation to eat salty foods is lessened or they can bring their own dish so they know there will at least be one thing that they can safely eat. When eating out, talk with them about reviewing the menu for items that contain fresh foods and ask the chef or cook to leave the salt out of the dish when preparing the meal. Let them know that chefs are adept at taking special orders for dietary restrictions or allergies.\n\n【17】8.6 Putting It All Together\n---------------------------\n\n【18】John Jones is a 58-year-old black man who has had a long history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. He experienced a myocardial infarction and was treated with PTCA and stent to the right coronary artery 3 years prior. He has worked at the local factory filling rail cars for the past 19 years. He is married with two children, one in high school and one in her first year of college. He was admitted to General Hospital 3 days ago for progressive increase in shortness of breath and was found to have heart failure (HF) with an ejection fraction of 22%. He was placed on guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) and underwent a cardiac catheterization with no further intervention required. He has been noted to have intermittent PVCs. His new medications include Entresto 24/26 mg twice daily, Carvedilol 25 mg twice daily, Spironolactone 25 mg daily, dapagliflozin 5 mg daily and furosemide 40 mg daily. He is scheduled for follow-up with his primary care provider in 1 week and cardiologist in 3–4 weeks.\n\n【19】Considerations:\n\n【20】   New diagnosis\n\n【21】   New medications\n\n【22】   Home support\n\n【23】   Communication/Hand off\n\n【24】To facilitate this patient’s transition to home, nurses and providers must take into consideration the above factors. With a new diagnosis of HF, patients may or may not fully appreciate what that means. Ensuring evidence-based education is provided to both the patient and his significant other using teach-back prior to discharge is critical. The patient not only has been given a new diagnosis but will be required to make many life changes (diet, activity, medications). HF education should begin on admission and continue through discharge and each follow-up outpatient visit 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Assess what the patient and significant other know regarding HF and build their knowledge. Throughout the hospital course and discharge process shared decision making is key. With the new medications ensure the patient has a good understanding of what medications have been discontinued, what medications he should continue from the past, and what new medications have been added. Review the medications, purpose, side effects, what to do in the event of side effects, and the importance of taking them as prescribed. Discuss with the patient his prescription plan and determine if the patient can afford and is willing to obtain the new medications. Although the medications listed are GDMT if the patient cannot afford them or if there are other barriers address them prior to discharge. Consider getting the prescriptions filled as the patient is leaving the facility or at his local pharmacy to be picked up on his way home.\n\n【25】Home support is essential to ensure a good successful transition home. Depending upon the hospital facility an array of services may be considered. Regardless of the services (care coordination, home health, remote monitoring, and/or phone follow-up), contact with the patient soon after discharge anywhere from 1 to 7 days has been found to be beneficial 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.

Timely, accessible information regarding the patient’s diagnosis, weight, symptoms, and treatment plan needs to be shared with the healthcare team. Quality communication with healthcare providers facilitates and promotes positive patient outcomes.\n\n【27】At General Hospital Mr. Jones and his wife received over 1 h of HF education. He received printed literature, weight diaries, and a scale. He met with the registered dietician who discussed his diet as it related to his diabetes and HF. The pharmacist at the hospital met with Mr. Jones and reviewed his medications, provided him an updated medication list, and assessed the cost of his new prescriptions. Currently Mr. Jones is amendable to filling and taking his recommended medications as prescribed. His follow-up appointment was scheduled in 5 days with his Primary Care Provider (PCP) and numbers were given to call should he have symptoms or questions. Cardiac rehabilitation will reach out to the patient in the next 6 weeks to schedule Phase II. Home health was scheduled to evaluate following discharge. The HF team contacted the patient via phone 3 days following discharge and reviewed his treatment plan and addressed questions. When home health arrived 4 days following discharge the patient’s weight had continued to decline and the patient appeared dry. A call was placed to his PCP and his diuretic dose was reduced and a basic metabolic panel was ordered. The patient and his wife had several questions regarding his medications and diet, which the home health nurse addressed, and the requested laboratory test was drawn. The following morning the patient was evaluated by his PCP and his laboratory results were reviewed and his renal function displayed a slight decline. His PCP will continue with his reduced dose of diuretic. The patient and his wife both verbalize questions and would like to connect with other people with a similar diagnosis. A list of reliable resources was provided, and they connected with the HF Patient Foundation and Together in HF.

For cells, this behavior takes the form of protein–protein interactions that occur in a sequence known as a signal cascade . A signal from the environment, a ligand , binds to a receptor protein located either on the surface of the plasma membrane or in the cytoplasm of the cell. Ligand binding triggers a conformational change in the receptor that causes a change in a second protein. Like a row of falling dominos, conformational changes in one protein in the signal pathway results in a change in the next until the signal results in a cellular response . A response could be as simple as opening or closing an ion channel or it could be as complicated as altering the gene expression of the cell.\n\n【4】One of the important signal pathways in a cell makes use of a class of receptor proteins known as G protein-coupled receptors ( GPCRs ). Two characteristics that distinguish GPCRs are the presence of seven transmembrane domains that insert the receptor into the cell’s plasma membrane and the ability of the receptor to bind to a collection of heterotrimeric G proteins (G <sub>α </sub> , G <sub>ß </sub> , and G <sub>γ </sub> ). Small G proteins bind and hydrolyze the nucleotide GTP. The activity of the G <sub>α </sub> proteins depends upon GTP. With GTP attached, the G <sub>α </sub> protein is active. It dissociates from the G <sub>ß </sub> and G <sub>γ </sub> subunits and interacts with effector proteins, causing conformational changes and propagating a signal. In some cases, the G <sub>ß </sub> and G <sub>γ </sub> subunits also play a role in activating effector proteins. Eventually, the GTPase activity of the G <sub>α </sub> converts the GTP to guanosine diphosphate (GDP), at which point G <sub>α </sub> is inactive. At this point, it reassociates with G <sub>ß </sub> and G <sub>γ, </sub> and rebinds to the cytoplasmic domain of the GPCR. Should another ligand bind to the receptor, a conformational change in GPCR will trigger the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G <sub>α </sub> subunit, and the process begins again.\n\n【5】In the GTP-bound state, G <sub>α </sub> subunits activate the effector protein adenylyl cyclase, an enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) from ATP. Cyclic AMP is a second messenger molecule that can influence the activity of a host of other proteins in the cell. Activation of adenylyl cyclase leads to the production of multiple molecules of cAMP, effectively amplifying the signal from the original interaction between receptor and ligand.\n\n【6】▪ What type of environmental signals would be important for a cell to be able to sense?\n\n【7】▪ What determines the specificity between a ligand and its receptor?\n\n【8】▪ List the steps involved in gene expression. Where in your list could a protein:protein interaction from a signal pathway influence gene expression?\n\n【9】▪ Define the term “heterotrimeric” in your own words.\n\n【10】▪ How might cAMP contribute to the change in gene expression described previously?\n\n【11】▪ Conduct a search for images or videos that illustrate the activity of GPCRs and G proteins.\n\n【12】Background\n----------\n\n【13】The protozoan Dictyostelium discoideum spends most of its life as a single-cell amoeba. However, if the number of Dictyostelium in a population exceeds their food supply, then individual amoebae will aggregate to form a multicellular slug that moves through the environment until it finds a favorable spot, at which point it transforms into a structure known as a fruiting body . The fruiting body is made up of a stalk and a head. The head of the fruiting body is a mass of spores that are released and germinate into new amoebae.\n\n【14】The ability of the amoebae to sense and respond to starvation conditions requires signal pathways that ultimately alter gene expression in individual cells, resulting in the formation of the slug and fruiting body. Aggregation of cells into the slug form, occurs in response to gradients of extracellular cAMP, produced by individual cells within the population. Other soluble factors released by Dictyostelium cells into the surrounding environment, conditioned medium factors ( CMF s), in combination with cAMP, have been shown to influence changes in the expression of genes for cAMP receptors and cell adhesion molecules. Binding of CMFs to Dictyostelium cells activates a G protein–independent signaling pathway and a second, G protein–dependent pathway that involves the heterotrimeric G proteins, G <sub><span class=\"bold\">α </span></sub> 1 , G <sub><span class=\"bold\">ß </span></sub> , and G <sub><span class=\"bold\">γ </span></sub> . Activation of the CMF receptor activates G <sub>α </sub> 1, freeing G <sub>ß </sub> and G <sub>γ </sub> to bind to phospholipase C ( PLC ), triggering an increase in inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP <sub>3 </sub> ).\n\n【15】The protein receptor phosphoinositol kinase A ( RpkA ) is a seven-membrane-spanning domain protein. Given the apparent role of a G protein in the signaling pathway associated with the development of Dictyostelium from a single-cell to a multicellular organism it is reasonable to investigate whether RpkA plays a part in the starvation signal pathway.\n\n【16】▪ Conduct a search for images of the life cycle of D. discoideum .\n\n【17】▪ Discuss whether the extracellular cAMP produced by Dictyostelium in response to starvation would be considered a second messenger.\n\n【18】▪ Propose a model to explain how a cell can “sense” a concentration gradient of cAMP.\n\n【19】▪ What characteristic defines RpkA as a GPCR?\n\n【20】Methods\n-------\n\n【21】### Cell culture\n\n【22】Wild-type or mutant D. discoideum were grown in either liquid nutrient broth with shaking or on nutrient agar at 21°C in the presence of the bacteria Klebsiella aerogenes provided as a food source. Development of fruiting bodies was induced by starvation. Cells were grown to a density of 3 × 10 <sup>6 </sup> cells/mL, washed with buffer, plated onto agar plates at various cell densities, and allowed to develop at 21°C. The RpkA gene was removed (knocked out) of the Dictyostelium genome using a homologous recombination. Removal of the gene was confirmed using PCR.\n\n【23】### Assays\n\n【24】Streaming assays were performed by starving the cells at 1 × 10 <sup>6 </sup> cells/mL in 1 mL of buffer. Conditioned medium and recombinant CMF (1 ng/mL) were added to the buffer, and cells were observed using a stereomicroscope equipped with a video camera.\n\n【25】Production of IP <sub>3 </sub> was determined using a commercially available kit (GE Healthcare). The assay was performed in the presence or absence of recombinant CMF (1 ng/mL).\n\n【26】### Northern and immunoblot analysis\n\n【27】Total RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy kit. RNA (10 μg per lane) was subjected to electrophoresis in 1.2% agarose/formaldehyde gels and transferred onto a nylon membrane. The cDNA fragments that were used as probes were radiolabeled with \\[α通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>32 </sup></u> P\\]ATP.\n\n【28】Total cell extracts were prepared by lysis of Dictyostelium cells in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Homogenates of equal amounts of cells were separated on a 10 or 12% polyacrylamide gel, and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Proteins were visualized using the indicated primary antibodies and chemiluminescent secondary antibody.\n\n【29】▪ Predict whether starvation might occur more quickly for cells in a liquid or a solid media.\n\n【30】▪ Compare and differentiate the protocols for a Northern blot and a Western blot.\n\n【31】▪ Debate whether lysis of an equivalent number of cells, is an acceptable standard if a researcher wants to claim that the same amount of total protein has been loaded on a gel.\n\n【32】Results\n-------\n\n【33】▪ Estimate how long it took for the cells in Figure 12.1.1 to deplete their food supply.\n\n【34】▪ Label the AX2 panels in Figure 12.1.1 to indicate, which stage in the life cycle of Dictyostelium is represented.\n\n【35】▪ Describe how the response of the AX2 and rpkA <sup>− </sup> cells to starvation differed.\n\n【36】▪ Summarize the phenotype of the rpkA <sup>− </sup> cells.\n\n【37】▪ What is meant by “total RNA?” What is the relationship between a cDNA and an mRNA?\n\n【38】▪ Why was cyclase-associated protein (CAP) expression included in the results for Figure 12.1.2 ?\n\n【39】▪ What is the implication of the following result from Figure 12.1.2 a cDNA specific to adenylyl cyclase binds to the RNA sample from wild-type AX2 cells after 4 and 8 h in culture?\n\n【40】▪ Connect the functions of the three genes listed in Figure 12.1.2 with the activities associated with the aggregation phase of Dictyostelium early development.\n\n【41】▪ Relate the pattern of gene expression in Figure 12.1.2 with the pattern of behavior in Figure 12.1.1 . What can you conclude?\n\n【42】▪ Develop an argument for or against the statement, “proper expression of early developmental genes does not take place in rpkA <sup>− </sup> cells.”\n\n【43】▪ Summarize the results presented in Figure 12.1.3 a.\n\n【44】▪ Does activation of PLC require RpkA? Explain your answer.\n\n【45】▪ How do the data from Figure 12.1.3 support the conclusion that cells lacking the RpkA protein can produce, but cannot respond to, factors required for aggregation?\n\n【46】▪ It has been hypothesized that activation of the G protein G <sub>α </sub> 1 releases G <sub>ß </sub> and G <sub>γ </sub> to bind and activate PLC. Explain the data in Figure 12.1.3 b in the context of this hypothesis.\n\n【47】▪ Compare the phenotype of the wild-type AX2 cells and the g <sub><span class=\"italic\">α </span></sub> 1 <sup><span class=\"italic\">− </span></sup> cells that are missing from the G protein G <sub>α </sub> 1.\n\n【48】▪ How are the data in Figure 12.1.4 b different from those in Figure 12.1.2 ?\n\n【49】▪ Complete the following table based on the results presented in Figures 12.1.2 and 12.1.4 .\n\n【50】▪ What can you conclude from the aforementioned table?\n\n【51】▪ Restate the following excerpt using your own words, “RpkA seems to be needed for enabling signaling downstream of CMF, such as production of IP <sub>3 </sub> and establishment of full responsiveness to cAMP.

The most common causes of microcytic hypochromic anemia are iron deficiency， anemia of chronic disease， thalassemia， and siderob-lastic anemia.

In contrast to iron deficiency， which causes a microcytic hypochromic anemia， vitamin B， deficiency produces a macrocytic anemia.

She has a history of a pelvic infection. Her blood pressure is 90/60 mmHg, heart rate is 110 beats/min, and the abdomen is mildly tender. Pelvic examination shows a normal uterus and some moderate adnexal tenderness. Quantitative human β-corticotropin gonadotropin is 2300 mIU/mL, and transvaginal sonogram shows an empty uterus and some free fluid in the cul-de-sac.\n\n【8】• Most likely diagnosis: Ectopic pregnancy\n\n【9】• Cause of the hypotension: Ruptured ectopic pregnancy in the uterine tube with bleeding into the abdominal cavity\n\n【10】### CLINICAL CORRELATION\n\n【11】An ectopic pregnancy results when a blastocyst implants outside the lumen of the uterus. The vast majority of ectopic pregnancies occur in the uterine tube (95 to 97 percent), in either the ampulla, the usual site of fertilization; or the isthmus, the narrowest portion. Any condition that might prevent or delay transport of the zygote to the uterus may cause an ectopic tubal pregnancy, and this patient’s history of a pelvic infection (pelvic inflammatory disease) is a risk factor. Tubal ectopic pregnancies will usually rupture during the first 8 weeks of pregnancy, typically resulting in abortion of the embryo and intraabdominal hemorrhage, with resultant hypotension and tachycardia. Tubal pregnancy in the narrow isthmus tends to rupture sooner than those in the ampulla and produce greater hemorrhage than implantation in the ampulla. Blastocysts implanted in the ampulla may be expelled into the abdominal cavity, where they may reimplant on the surface of the ovary, the peritoneum of the rectouterine pouch (of Douglas), mesentery, or organ surface. Severe hemorrhage typically results from an abdominal ectopic pregnancy, and the resulting hypotension may be emergent. The free fluid seen on ultrasound is blood that has resulted from the ruptured ectopic pregnancy.\n\n【12】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【13】#### The Internal Female Genital System II\n\n【14】### OBJECTIVES\n\n【15】1\\. Be able to describe the anatomy of the uterine tubes\n\n【16】2\\. Be able to draw the blood supply to the ovaries, uterine tubes, and uterus\n\n【17】### DEFINITIONS\n\n【18】ECTOPIC PREGNANCY: Pregnancy outside of the normal endometrial implantation site, usually involving the fallopian tubes\n\n【19】HEMOPERITONEUM: Blood collecting inside the peritoneal cavity, usually leading to abdominal pain and irritation to the intestines\n\n【20】HUMAN CHORIONIC GONADOTROPIN: Glycoprotein molecule produced by the trophoblastic cells of the pregnancy\n\n【21】### DISCUSSION\n\n【22】The uterine (fallopian) tubes 删除25：<u></u> extend posterolaterally from the uterine horns and are divided, from medial to lateral, into four regions. The uterine or intramural portion lies within the wall of the uterus. The narrowest portion, or isthmus , lies just laterally to the uterine horns. More laterally, the widest and longest portion of the tube is the ampulla. This is the usual site of fertilization. The most lateral portion or infundibulum is funnel-shaped. The lumen of the infundibulum faces posteriorly into the abdominal cavity, inferior to which is the rectouterine pouch (of Douglas). The margin of the infundibulum is arranged in a series of fingerlike structures called fimbriae , one of which is usually attached to the ovary. This attachment helps keep the infundibulum in close anatomical relation to the ovary, which, in turn, helps ensure that an ovulated egg will enter the lumen of the tube. The uterine tube is supported by the mesosalpinx portion of the broad ligament .\n\n【23】删除3：<u>Figure 30-1. The female pelvis and internal organs (superior view). ( Reproduced, with permission, from Decherney AH, Nathan L. Current Obstetric and Gynecology Diagnosis and Treatment, 9th ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2003:33 .)</u>\n\n【24】The ovaries, uterine tubes, and fundus of the uterus are supplied by the ovarian arteries , which arise from the abdominal aorta just inferior to the renal arteries (in a manner similar to that described for the testicular arteries). The arteries descend, crossing the ureters anteriorly , and also cross the iliac vessels anteriorly at the pelvic brim. The ureters lie just medial at the pelvic brim. The arteries enter the lateral pole of each ovary, supply it, and continue medially between the layers of the mesosalpinx, close to its attachment to the uterine tube. Each artery supplies the tube, continues on to supply the fundus of the uterus, and anastomoses with the artery from the opposite side. The isthmus and uterine portions of the tube also receive blood from ascending branches of the uterine arteries , which anastomose with the ovarian artery. This accounts for the increased hemorrhage with a ruptured tubal pregnancy of the isthmus. Venous drainage from these structures is primarily through the ovarian veins, which empty into the IVC on the right side and into the left renal vein on the left side.\n\n【25】###", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 10:59:40", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:01:00", "cost": 80.213}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:45:58", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:00:58", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 18:59:38"}

Most antiviral therapies for HSV are nucleoside analogues or other inhibitors of the viral DNA polymerase. Answers A, B, D, and E are incorrect. HSV establishes lytic infections in fibroblast and epithelial cells and latent infections in neurons. Infection with HSV results in lifelong latent infection, even in persons with functional cell-mediated immunity.

After completing a full physical examination, her physician orders an x-ray of the chest, which shows enlarged hilar nodes bilaterally as well as lung nodules. Results of a lung biopsy are shown in the image.

This image shows noncaseating granulomas involving lung septae. Noncaseating granulomas are characteristic of sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is a multiorgan inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology. It is thought to be immune mediated. The lung is the most frequently involved organ, but other commonly affected organs are lymph nodes, skin, eyes, kidneys, the heart, and the CNS. Findings that might be expected in a patient with sarcoidosis include γ G lobulinemia, R heumatoid arthritis, elevated Angiotensin-converting enzyme levels, I nterstitial fibrosis, and N oncaseating granulomas (remember the mnemonic GRAIN ). Initial treatment of sarcoidosis includes a short course of glucocorti-coids such as dexamethasone if the patient is symptomatic. For chronic disease, glucocorticoids may be continued or alternative agents such as methotrexate may be used.  \n\n【6】Answer A is incorrect. Small cell lung cancer is recognized by numerous small blue neoplastic cells on histologic exam. The primary treatment of small cell lung cancer is operative, but in patients with stages IB and II disease, adjuvant therapy with cisplatin has shown a trend toward improved survival. The image shows noncaseating granulomas, which are characteristic of sarcoidosis and would not be treated with chemotherapy.  \n\n【7】Answer B is incorrect . Goodpasture syndrome is caused by anti-basement membrane antibodies, which can be demonstrated on immunofluorescence. It is not associated with noncaseating granulomas. Initial treatment of Goodpasture syndrome is a five-day course of methylprednisolone followed by a long taper and maintenance. However, if the disease is particularly severe, immunosuppressive agents such as cyclophosphamide or azathioprine may be started.  \n\n【8】Answer D is incorrect. SLE can be associated with pleuritis, but it is not associated with noncaseating granulomas. Initial treatment of nonlife-threatening SLE includes analgesics and antimalarials such as hydroxychloroquine. As this patient has sarcoidosis, not lupus, hydroxychloroquine would not be an appropriate treatment for her.  \n\n【9】Answer E is incorrect. TB is characterized by caseating granulomas, which can be recognized by the necrotic, cheese-like center in the granuloma. Bacteria within the granuloma may not be destroyed, but may rather be dormant only to be later reactivated. This is more likely if the patient is immunosuppressed at any time. TB is treated with a multidrug regimen consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for two months followed by a four-month course of isoniazid and rifampin.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:19:05", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:19:44", "cost": 39.002}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:45:58", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:19:41", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:19:02"}

Furthermore, the poor nutritional  删除换行1: intake, pallor and microcytic hypochromic anaemia are typical of iron deficiency anaemia.\n\n【30】Rickets is a disorder characterized by a failure in the mineralization of growing bones. The  删除换行1: majority of cases are due to inadequate sunlight exposure coupled with a nutritional defi删除8：<u>￾</u>ciency of vitamin D. The condition is more common in dark-skinned children who need  删除换行1: greater sun exposure to synthesize adequate amounts of vitamin D. Children in whom very  删除换行1: little skin is exposed to the sun, usually for religious reasons, are also at an increased risk of  删除换行1: rickets. Prolonged breast-feeding increases the risk of rickets, as breast milk is a poor source  删除换行1: of vitamin D. Infant formulas are often supplemented with vitamin D, but cow’s milk is also  删除换行1: a poor source of vitamin D. Diseases that interfere with the metabolic conversion and activa删除8：<u>￾</u>tion of vitamin D, such as severe renal and liver disease, can lead to rickets. Illnesses associ删除8：<u>￾</u>ated with malabsorption, such as coeliac disease, may also lead to rickets. Other diseases  删除换行1: that interfere with calcium and phosphate homeostasis can cause rickets, e.g. renal tubular  删除换行1: defects such as hypophosphataemic rickets, in which there is failure of phosphate absorption,  删除换行1: or Fanconi’s syndrome in which there is a defect in the reabsorption of phosphate, glucose  删除换行1: and amino acids.\n\n【31】Clinical features include swollen wrists and ankles, frontal bossing, prominent costochon删除8：<u>￾</u>dral junctions (a rickety rosary), bow-legs or knock-knees, craniotabes, muscle weakness,  删除换行1: tetany, hypocalcaemic fits and rarely a cardiomyopathy.\n\n【32】The wrist X-ray demonstrates the typical appearance in rickets with widening of the growth  删除换行1: plate and cupping, splaying and fraying of the metaphysis.\n\n【33】A vitamin D level to confirm the aetiology of the rickets and anti-tissue transglutaminase  删除换行1: antibody levels to rule out coeliac disease would be helpful.\n\n【34】Iron deficiency anaemia is said to occur in a quarter of children under 5 years of age. Cow’s  删除换行1: milk is a poor source of iron. Although usually nutritional, blood loss should be considered as  删除换行1: a possible cause, especially in older children. This may be due to occult gastrointestinal blood  删除换行1: loss secondary to a peptic ulcer, a Meckel’s diverticulum or inflammatory bowel disease. \n\n【35】A ferritin level should be done to confirm the diagnosis and is likely to be very low. \n\n【36】A  haemoglobinopathy screen should be performed in high-risk groups to exclude disorders  删除换行1: such as thalassaemia that can also cause a microcytic hypochromic anaemia and that may  删除换行1: coexist with iron deficiency. Infants may be pale, tired, irritable and anorexic. In severe cases  删除换行1: they can be tachypnoeic. There is evidence that iron deficiency anaemia can also have adverse  删除换行1: effects on attention span and learning.\n\n【37】Treatment consists of a 3-month course of high-dose oral vitamin D. Bone chemistry and  删除换行1: vitamin D should be measured 3 months after starting treatment to ensure that the biochemi删除8：<u>￾</u>cal parameters have normalized. This should be followed by maintenance doses of vitamin D \n\n【38】for the long term. The prognosis for complete resolution of the deformities is good. In cases  删除换行1: where the serum calcium is low, calcium is also given initially and more frequent blood tests  删除换行1: are required until the calcium level normalizes.\n\n【39】There is often an accompanying iron deficiency anaemia, as in Tariq’s case. Red meat and  删除换行1: green vegetables are good sources of iron and some foods, such as cereals, are often fortified 69\n\n【40】Case 23: A boy with bow legs 删除换行1: with iron. The anaemia should be treated with a 3-month course of oral iron. A dietetic  删除换行1:  referral and screening of the siblings for rickets and iron deficiency would also be advisable.\n\n【41】Key Points\n\n【42】• Rickets is usually secondary to inadequate exposure to sunlight and to poor  删除换行1: nutrition.\n\n【43】• Swollen wrists, a rickety rosary and bow-legs are typical clinical features.\n\n【44】• Treatment is done with vitamin D.\n\n【45】• Iron deficiency is very common in young children and can be successfully treated  删除换行1: with dietary advice and oral iron.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:09:30", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:09:39", "cost": 8.296}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:45:58", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:09:39", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:09:30"}

However, pulmonary aspergillosis has  删除换行1: varied manifestation depending on the host’s immune status or pulmonary structure. \n\n【6】The spectrum of pulmonary disease ranges from noninvasive disease, as colonization  删除换行1: of organism or the presence of a fungus ball (aspergilloma), or an allergic response  删除换行1: responsible for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), to semi-invasive or  删除换行1: invasive infections such as chronic necrotizing pneumonia and invasive pulmonary  删除换行1: aspergillosis.

The radiological presen删除8：<u>￾</u>tation of pulmonary nocardiosis is nonspecific. The most common radiological findings  删除换行1: are consolidations and large irregular nodules.

At this point, the therapist personified OCD and suggested to Natalie that the objective was to “mess” with OCD: OCD was demanding a ritual to be performed “just so” and Natalie’s goal was to do it the “wrong” way (e.g. leaving some asymmetry, postponing the ritual, making it difficult to complete the ritual, restricting the time devoted to the ritual, etc.), if she could not resist not doing it at all. The personification of OCD was extremely helpful to Natalie insofar as it gave her something concrete to imagine fighting against, and so she and her therapist used this type of phrasing for the remainder of the treatment course.\n\n【4】For Natalie’s first exposure, her therapist suggested starting with an exercise that would provoke low-to-moderate levels of anxiety, as measured by subjective units of distress (SUDs) on a 0 (no distress) to 10 (extreme distress) scale. A situation linked with a SUD level of 4 was selected as something that would reliably provoke distress, but would not be so overwhelming that Natalie could not resist the urge to ritualize. Natalie and her therapist agreed on the following exposure: Have Natalie go to a nearby convenience store and buy several items (e.g. gum, ice tea, lip balm) based on the lowest price, regardless of into which category the item fit. Importantly, Natalie agreed that she would not go back to the store to balance out the boy/girl ratio after the session was over. Despite Natalie’s initial expectations, her distress habituated, and she did not experience this exposure as “torture.” At the conclusion of the session, Natalie’s therapist asked her to narrow down the experience into one take home “nugget,” or lesson learned. Natalie stated that she was amazed to realize that her anxiety did indeed subside as promised, and that she also was able to tolerate the anxiety without engaging in rituals. For her initial homework, Natalie was instructed to practice ERP each day.\n\n【5】Subsequent exposures were structured in a similar manner. Natalie and her therapist would jointly choose the exposure, always using in-session practice to move up slightly on her fear hierarchy , followed by daily practice for homework. At the conclusion of each exposure exercise, Natalie was always asked to formulate a succinct, key lesson learned. Exposures were initially selected in such a way that the outcome could either be symmetrical or asymmetrical, the important aspect being that Natalie did not have control over the situation. In all of these cases, Natalie was asked to make a decision about something using a rule other than the boy/girl classification system. For example, rather than Natalie choosing the color of her nail polish, she would ask the nail technician to choose a color randomly. After Natalie was able to tolerate the distress associated with these types of exposures, her therapist suggested exposures in which Natalie purposely made things asymmetrical. For example, she would purposely choose the same “gender” nail polish to wear for several weeks, or would purposely order “asymmetrical” food at restaurants.\n\n【6】Exposures towards the end of therapy were exclusively focused around the upper quadrant of Natalie’s fear hierarchy, which was expanded as treatment progressed. One example exposure was having Natalie purposefully organize her living space in an asymmetrical manner. The patient was very interested in art, and she would hang pictures in a particular manner to achieve a boy/girl balance. Together with her therapist, Natalie proceeded to print out copies of the various pictures she owned and then proceeded to hang them in an asymmetrical manner in the therapy room. She was then asked to complete the same procedure with her pictures at home. Another exposure involved having Natalie curate her art by selecting her favorite posters and then discarding or donating the others, regardless of the resulting imbalance between boy/girl art. A final set of exposures were designed to address Natalie’s fear regarding asymmetry and her worry that she would always experience her obsessions. Specifically, Natalie’s therapist guided her in an imaginal exposure on what it would be like to live in an asymmetrical world forever.\n\n【7】Complicating Factor\n\n【8】A main complicating factor in Natalie’s treatment was that after initial treatment gains, she experienced fluctuating levels of motivation with regard to her willingness to do exposures and to continue with therapy. As often occurs with patients with OCD, as one’s symptoms wax and wane—both naturally and throughout the course of treatment—the individual’s ambivalence regarding change may also fluctuate, which can contribute to the treatment refusal and drop out 删除10：<u>(Maltby and Tolin 2003 )</u>. The nature of exposure exercises is intrinsically frightening and demanding; as progress is achieved on lower steps of the fear hierarchy, patients may be resistant to tackling more challenging exposures as entailed in the full treatment plan. In Natalie’s case, her motivation faltered because she experienced less impairment after she responded to the first phase of ERP. As described in the overview section, she did not find her concerns with asymmetry inherently ego-dystonic, so once she was able to participate more fully in day-to-day activities without interference from her symptoms, she experienced less impetus to continue with treatment.\n\n【9】Natalie’s therapist became aware of the fact that Natalie was not completing her weekly homework and had become less focused on therapy (e.g. tardy to sessions, less enthusiastic, refusing to comply with planned in-session exposures). The therapist responded by directly discussing these observations with Natalie, along with the potential reasons for her nonadherence. Several possibilities for why Natalie may have had difficulty completing the homework exposures were explored, including level of exposure difficulty (i.e. Were the exposures too difficult to complete alone?) and logistical reasons (i.e. Was she running out of time during the week? Was there some external reason that was preventing her from completing the homework?). Natalie stated that none of these issues were causing interference, and that she simply was no longer bothered as much by her symptoms as when she first entered therapy.\n\n【10】At this point, Natalie’s therapist shifted into several sessions of modified motivational enhancement training 删除10：<u>(MET; Miller et al. 1994 )</u>. MET is a motivational interviewing 删除10：<u>(MI; Miller and Rollnick 2002 )</u> technique that can be applied in conjunction with ERP to increase and maintain motivation for change throughout ERP. The integration of MI with CBT has been found to be successful for those individuals with anxiety disorders 删除10：<u>(Westra 2004 )</u> and has also been shown to be effective in increasing adherence to exposure therapy in particular 删除10：<u>(Slagle and Gray 2007 )</u>. Originally developed to target alcohol addiction, MI includes a range of strategies to help explore and resolve ambivalence about change, such as demonstrating empathy and fostering discrepancy regarding beliefs, while avoiding a confrontational stance 删除10：<u>(Westra 2004 )</u>. It can first be applied at the start of the treatment to help change maladaptive beliefs, minimize reluctance to attempt exposures, and instill self-confidence in treatment goals 删除10：<u>(Riccardi et al. 2010 )</u>. Furthermore, therapists can continue to employ MI techniques at points throughout ERP where hesitance about further exposures becomes evident. While allowing the patient to explore his or her own positive and negative feelings about personal symptoms and the direction of treatment, therapists can guide him/her to bolster his/her own motivation by raising questions about discrepancies between the pros and cons of treatment adherence (i.e. a mismatch between remaining OCD-related impairment vs. personal priorities and goals). As such, MI can help maintain momentum and help increase treatment adherence and retention 删除10：<u>(Riccardi et al. 2010 )</u>. In the case of Natalie, MET was highly effective in helping her refocus her treatment efforts. It was also instrumental in helping Natalie’s therapist recognize that a greater focus on cognitive work would be helpful in addressing some of Natalie’s attributions and beliefs about her symptoms.\n\n【11】Cognitive Restructuring\n\n【12】At the start of therapy, Natalie and her therapist identified four primary cognitions that were integral to maintaining her symptoms. The first was that anxiety was dangerous, intolerable, and that it would not dissipate unless she made things symmetrical. She also believed that living an asymmetrical life was dangerous because it evoked anxiety and distress, and that she would therefore be unable to cope with a lack of symmetry. Both of these beliefs were addressed non-directly through Natalie’s experiences with ERP. Over time and repeated exposures, Natalie learned that she could in fact tolerate the anxiety related to experiencing NJREs, and that her distress faded with time.\n\n【13】The other two cognitions that were central to Natalie’s OCD included the belief that she needed to control her thoughts, and the fact that she placed a marked value on symmetry and perfection. These beliefs did not change in response to ERP and shifted into greater focus as a result of the MET/MI-focused sessions. To target these beliefs, Natalie’s therapist used a range of different cognitive strategies flexibly and on an as-needed basis to try and encourage Natalie to achieve a more helpful or rationale response 删除10：<u>(Wilhelm and Steketee 2006 )</u>. Example techniques included Socratic dialogue to highlight logical inconsistencies in Natalie’s thinking patterns, discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of her beliefs, the continuum technique to highlight the implications of only focusing on extremes, and behavioral experiments to test Natalie’s assumptions. Two behavioral experiments that were particularly helpful were testing the consequences of asymmetry and the classic “white bear” thought suppression exercise. These experiences allowed Natalie to test the validity of her assumptions, by contrasting her feared outcome to actual consequences. Another helpful cognitive technique was the use of metaphors, stories, and analogies, which were designed to promote acceptance of her intrusive boy/girl classification thoughts and her need for symmetry. This latter technique was particularly helpful in addressing the shame and sadness Natalie felt in response to having OCD.\n\n【14】Therapy Conclusion and Relapse Prevention\n\n【15】After 19 sessions, Natalie and her therapist agreed that she had made sufficient progress to no longer need weekly sessions and that therapy could possibly be terminated soon. The next two sessions focused on relapse prevention. First, Natalie and her therapist created a handout that incorporated and summarized all of the behavioral and cognitive tools that Natalie had learned. The therapist also spent time evaluating Natalie’s thoughts about treatment termination. Together, they discussed potential difficulties that may arise, along with possible solutions. After a 1-month hiatus, Natalie returned to therapy and provided an update on her symptoms and her use of CBT. The patient was pleased to report that she had felt confident addressing any symptoms that emerged and had successfully navigated two minor setbacks. The therapist used the latter situations to help Natalie differentiate between lapses and relapses and underscored the importance of engaging in helpful thinking about how best to react towards symptom flare-ups. At this point, Natalie and her therapist agreed that it was an appropriate time to terminate treatment, though the possibility of booster sessions was discussed.\n\n【16】Conclusions and Key Practice Points\n-----------------------------------\n\n【17】On the whole, the cognitive behavioral approach to treating Natalie’s symmetry symptoms was very effective. During the first phase of treatment, which was more strongly rooted within a behavioral framework, Natalie was able to substantially reduce her compulsions and was also able to tackle the vast majority of the original fear hierarchy she and her therapist had outlined. Following the MI-focused sessions that were used after the first wave of ERP, more and more cognitive techniques were woven into the treatment plan. This shift in treatment approach was important for Natalie, as it allowed her to evaluate a number of her thinking patterns relevant to both OCD and her symptoms of depression. The final phase of treatment included a combination of cognitive and ERP techniques to tackle the upper limits of her fear hierarchy. Throughout the course of treatment, Natalie’s therapist continually monitored the patient’s symptoms and any treatment interfering behaviors. This allowed for a flexible use of cognitive and behavioral techniques that best fit Natalie’s needs at any given point in time. Another key element of the treatment approach was that Natalie and her therapist worked very collaboratively in selecting exposures, designing homework, and identifying next treatment targets. Over time, this approach allowed Natalie to become her own therapist, an important element in helping to prepare her for the time following the termination of therapy .\nTable 6.3 删除换行 Key practice points for treating the primary problem\n\n| Key practice points |\n| --- |\n| Careful assessment at intake and continued monitoring of symptoms |\n| Response prevention combined with exposures using a carefully captured fear hierarchy |\n| Cognitive techniques to target dysfunctional automatic thoughts and core beliefs |\n| Managing obstacles, including difficulties with habituation during exposures, waxing and waning motivation |\n\n【19】At the end of the treatment, Natalie’s therapist once again had her complete the battery of questionnaires and interviews listed in Table 6.1 . Across the board, the assessment indicated that she no longer became anxious when things were uneven or asymmetrical. Natalie also reported not engaging in avoidance of situations that previously had provoked anxiety and had almost completely eliminated her mental compulsions and physical rituals. Most importantly, Natalie expressed satisfaction and happiness that she could finally make decisions in her life based on her personal preferences, rather than basing decisions on her OCD. Her YBOCS score decreased throughout the treatment and was determined to meet criteria for symptom remission, as evidenced by a reduction of over 45–50 % 删除10：<u>(Storch et al. 2010 )</u>. Additionally, Natalie no longer met criteria for OCD and endorsed only mild depressive symptoms. Natalie reported that although she still struggled from time to time with feeling discouraged when she experienced an obsession, overall she felt proud of the work she had done and the fact that she had learned to live in “an asymmetrical world.”", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:43:44", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:43:57", "cost": 12.966}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:45:58", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:43:55", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:43:42"}

Vitamin B12 is a necessary cofactor in the regeneration of folate for methyl group donation in DNA synthesis. For this reason, vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies each present with megaloblastic anemia and hypersegmented neutrophils, as all blood cell lines are affected by the defect in DNA synthesis. However, only vitamin B12 deficiency increases serum methylmalonic acid levels and impairs myelin synthesis. This myelin defect primarily impacts the posterior and lateral spinal columns, causing paresthesias and impaired proprioception. Thus, neurologic abnormality in the context of megaloblastic anemia is a USMLE-favorite hint that vitamin B12 , rather than folate, is deficient.  \n\n【6】Answer A is incorrect. Confusion, confabulation, and ataxia are typical of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, a disorder of thiamine (vitamin B1 ) deficiency typical in alcoholics.  \n\n【7】Answer B is incorrect. Folate and vitamin B12 deficiencies present similarly, but folate deficiency does not manifest with an elevated methylmalonic acid level or neurologic problems. In the absence of increased serum methylmalonate levels, therefore, the physician would diagnose folate deficiency, and no neurologic symptoms would be expected.  \n\n【8】Answer C is incorrect. Concurrent onset of dysarthria (defective articulation) and diplopia may indicate that a transient ischemic episode or cerebrovascular accident has occurred. These symptoms are not typical of any vitamin deficiency.  \n\n【9】Answer E is incorrect.

Tolbutamide is a first-generation sulfonylurea that acts by stimulating the closing of potassium channels expressed in the cell membrane of pancreatic acinar β cells. It causes cellular depolarization and then calcium influx, which in turn triggers insulin release. An adverse effect of the first-generation sulfonylureas is a disulfiram-like reaction, including flushing, tachycardia, nausea, and hyperventilation. Tolbutamide is ineffective in conditions in which there is an absolute deficiency of insulin, such as type 1 diabetes.  \n\n【7】Answer A is incorrect . Acarbose is an α-glucosidase inhibitor that acts at the intestinal brush border to decrease the absorption of starches and other polysaccharides. This agent would be effective in maintaining glycemic control in someone with type 2 diabetes.  \n\n【8】Answer B is incorrect . Glargine is a long-acting synthetic insulin that provides a continuous baseline level of insulin in the blood. This agent would be appropriate for use in a patient with type 1 diabetes, where it can be used in combination with a short- or intermediate-acting insulin to cover the glycemic loads associated with meals and snacks.

Access and review of the patient’s hospital records, diagnostic tests, procedures, and discharge summary prior to the appointment will facilitate patient evaluation and implementation of the treatment plan. Having a clear well-developed evidence-based treatment plan that is shared and communicated to the patient and family will facilitate adherence. When reminding the patient of their appointment encourage them to write down any questions or concerns, to ensure they are addressed during their appointment. Continued education and review of information will be necessary to promote understanding. Remember this is a stressful time and many patients with HF discharged from the hospital are depressed, fatigued, and perceive a poor quality of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】When the patient is newly diagnosed with HF, confirmation of the diagnosis should be made with current or prior signs or symptoms. In addition, a structural or functional cardiac abnormality should be corroborated by either an elevated natriuretic peptide level (either B-type natriuretic peptide level \\[BNP\\] or N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide \\[NT-proBNP\\]) or objective evidence of pulmonary or systemic congestion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 34 \\]</u>. Patients meeting these criteria are considered Stage C and patients without current or prior signs and symptoms are considered Stage B or pre-HF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 34 \\]</u>. Patients with severe symptoms and who are either intolerant or refractory to guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) are Stage D advanced HF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 34 \\]</u>. Assigning New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class is recommended at baseline and after treatment throughout the continuum of care. The NYHA functional class serves to characterize symptoms and functional capacity on a scale from I to IV. Patients with increased NYHA functional class (II–IV) are recommended to undergo further optimization of GDMT if possible 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 34 \\]</u>. All patients should have their HF staged and NYHA functional class assigned.\n\n【3】### 8.4.1 History\n\n【4】A complete history is important in evaluating the patient post-hospital discharge in determining precipitating events, signs, and symptoms and potential cardiac disorders and/or comorbidities that contributed to the hospitalization. Dyspnea and fatigue that occurs at rest or with activity are cardinal symptoms of HF. During transition from the hospital to follow-up, the patient’s fluid state is a primary concern. However, some patients may have difficulty articulating symptoms and equate them to the aging process or some other factor such as being out of shape. The history should include the history of present illness, past medical history, family history, personal history, review of systems and functional assessment. If the patient is known to the provider, the history may be more focused on precipitating events and present illness. When interviewing the patient, it is critically important to question the occurrence of symptoms, severity, and factors that exacerbate their symptoms. Questions such as do their symptoms occur at rest or with activity? Do they wake up at night with symptoms of shortness of breath? How many pillows do they sleep with or is the head of their bed elevated? Have they noted a change in weight (gain or loss)? Have they noticed swelling in their abdomen, hands, feet, or legs? Potential precipitating factors should also be assessed such as, but not limited to, sleep disorder breathing, anemia, arrhythmia, infection, or change in medication. Among patients with a HF exacerbation assessment of dietary, uncontrolled comorbidity, missed or nonadherence to prescribed medications or exacerbating medication such as NSAIDs should be evaluated. If family members or a caregiver is present for the appointment, they may provide additional insight into the patient’s signs and symptoms of prior hospitalization and following discharge. A quality history takes time, attention to detail, and a trusting open rapport with both the patient and family.\n\n【5】A risk assessment is recommended which may include B-type natriuretic peptide levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 , 35 \\]</u>. Prior hospital discharge or on initial return to the office obtaining a natriuretic peptide level is helpful in establishing post-discharge prognosis and can be a point of comparison when following the patient post-discharge 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 35 \\]</u>. Of note patients who have been prescribed an angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) must only have NT-proBNP drawn since BNP is a substrate of neprilysin and will result in an artificially elevated reading. A variety of validated risk assessment tools to examine morbidity and mortality are available for both HF reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and HF preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) online to assess patients with chronic HF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 36 , 37 \\]</u>. Patients following their initial diagnosis of HF often have several questions regarding their prognosis and risk assessment tools can be helpful.\n\n【6】### 8.4.2 Physical Examination\n\n【7】Physical examination of patients with HF includes a focused evaluation of the cardiac and pulmonary systems with components of the integumentary and gastrointestinal systems. All initial and return appointments should include weight, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and respiratory rate (RR) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. The patient’s vital signs should fall within a normal range and if they do not then adjustments to the treatment plan should be considered. Orthostatic BP and HR should be evaluated on return and provide important insight into the patient’s volume status 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. The patient’s HR, rhythm, and character should be evaluated. An elevated HR can indicate dehydration, low cardiac output, and/or a stress response whereas a low HR could suggest bradycardia, heart block, arrhythmia, or response to beta blocker therapy. Ventricular and atrial arrhythmias are common in patients with HF. Providers should inspect the head, neck, and chest when beginning their examination. Assessment for jugular venous distention with the patient’s head elevated above 45° signifies increased central venous pressure indicative of congestion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 , 38 \\]</u>. The abdominojugular test should be performed if jugular venous distention is present and is associated with an elevated wedge pressure and right ventricular HF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 38 \\]</u>. Cardiac enlargement may be detected when palpating the precordium with an apical impulse displaced laterally to the left and downward. A clear S <sub>1 </sub> and S <sub>2 </sub> should be auscultated. However, some patients with HF may have a third heart sound ( S <sub>3 </sub> ) that persists when sitting up is associated with diastolic dysfunction and fluid volume overload 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 38 \\]</u>. A fourth heart sound may also occur ( S <sub>4 </sub> ) but is not a sign of failure but instead decreased ventricular compliance. When an elevated HR occurs in this instance the two sounds merge, and a summation gallop is heard 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 38 \\]</u>. Murmurs suggest valvular disease. In HF particularly advanced murmurs are frequently present.\n\n【8】Ideally in patients with stable HF clear breath sounds should be heard. When there is accumulation of fluid it can lead to pulmonary crackles. Initially, late inspiratory crackles are present typically in the bases of the lungs; later as the patient becomes more congested diffuse crackles can be heard across the chest 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 38 \\]</u>. Although the absence of crackles does not exclude pulmonary edema. Pulmonary compromise is also reflected in the respiratory rate and pattern. Tachypnea or Cheyne-Stokes with diaphoresis, tachycardia, and extremity coldness can reflect compromise and decompensation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 39 \\]</u>.\n\n【9】Patients with HF may or may not present with edema. When present, it is often detected in the abdomen, feet, ankles, hands, or sacral area. The patient’s skin may appear either pallor or cyanosis and cool to touch. Patients may not report abdominal complaints but may have accumulated significant fluid either as ascites or visceral edema. Symptoms associated with abdominal fluid retention include indigestion, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 38 \\]</u>. For more details on physical exam findings, refer to chapter “Physical Exam for Presence and Severity of Heart Failure” in this book.\n\n【10】### 8.4.3 Assessment of Weights\n\n【11】While hospitalized patients should have received education and instructions on self-care behaviors and life-style modifications, patients are often instructed to weigh their self each day typically upon rising in the morning after they urinate. Consistent assessment is critical in determining if there is a meaningful change in weight. Variance between hospital, home, and office scales can result in confusion. If the patient was fluid volume overloaded when presenting to the hospital their weight should have declined. Unfortunately, many times patients are discharged from the hospital before they have reached their dry weight 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 40 \\]</u>. Establishing a dry weight range for the patient using their home scales and when to call with changes is important. This should be clearly documented in the patient’s medical record to be used as a reference point when the patient calls the office. Assisting the patient in understanding how fluctuations in weight can occur and the importance of reporting symptoms regardless of their weight is key. Regular review of weight diaries by the provider is important. Discussing times of increased weight and jointly identifying potential contributing factors are educational opportunities. Additional patient monitoring of self-care activities will be discussed later in this chapter.\n\n【12】### 8.4.4 Medication reconciliation\n\n【13】Medication reconciliation is an important activity in the initial follow-up appointment and after any changes to the patient’s treatment plan. Although errors in medications can occur at any time they are reported to be as high as 50% in adult and elderly patients discharged from the hospital 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 41 \\]</u>. Patients should be instructed to bring in all their medications (i.e. anything they are taking which includes over-the-counter medications or supplements as well as medications they have discontinued) to their appointment. A nurse or pharmacist can assist with the review and reconciliation process. Unfortunately, patients sometimes fail to discontinue old medications and begin new ones, or during hospitalization medications are changed due to formularies resulting in the patient potentially taking duplicate medications from a single drug class. A complete review of all medications, frequency, and dose should be undertaken with the patient. Examining prescription refill patterns also provides insight into the patient’s prior adherence patterns. Ensuring the patient has a clear understanding of their medications, the reason for the medications, and a process that facilitates adherence is key. During the initial follow-up further optimization of GDMT may be undertaken as part of the treatment plan. This process should be reviewed with the patient and joint decision making occur. It is important to identify and address all barriers that may prevent the patient from taking their medications as prescribed. Patients should be instructed on potential side effects of their medications, to not discontinue their medications without medical direction, and to contact the office if there are questions or a change in status occurs. Optimization of GDMT should occur every two weeks if possible until the patient has reached target-tolerated dosing.\n\n【14】### 8.4.5 Diagnostics and Laboratory Testing\n\n【15】A major goal in managing the newly diagnosed patient with HF or the patient who experienced an exacerbation is to determine, if possible, the underlying cause or precipitating event. Depending upon the extent of evaluation during the hospitalization will determine the need for diagnostic evaluation following hospital discharge. Transthoracic doppler echocardiogram combined with doppler flow studies is one of the most valuable tools in evaluating the patient with HF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. However, repeated measurement in the absence of a status change or treatment interventions should not be performed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Patients who are suspected of having coronary disease and would be candidates for revascularization should undergo coronary angiography 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】Patients admitted to the hospital with HF typically undergo laboratory testing and should include complete blood count, urinalysis, serum electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, calcium, magnesium, glucose, fasting lipid profile, liver function, thyroid stimulating hormone, and either BNP or NT-proBNP levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 , 35 \\]</u>. Review of previous laboratory diagnostics, comorbidities, and patient assessment will guide requests for testing post-discharge from the hospital. Laboratory testing should be coordinated and communicated with all providers to avoid duplication. Serial monitoring of laboratory tests includes renal function and electrolytes with changes in the patient’s fluid state and optimization of GDMT. For ACEI, ARB, or ARNI class medications and aldosterone receptor antagonists such as spironolactone, potassium and renal function should be monitored at the time of initiation and then closely monitored thereafter to minimize the risk of hyperkalemia and renal insufficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】### 8.4.6 Optimization of Guideline-Directed Medical Therapy\n\n【18】Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) is critically important to ensure optimal outcomes of patients with HF. Current recommendations are based on evidence and all patients with HF should be treated based on current evidence, yet treatment plans must be individualized to the patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Providers should review current GDMT to stay up to date on any recommendations or changes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 , 35 \\]</u>.

The patient is tall and thin with pale skin, fair hair, and flushed cheeks. He has arachnodactyly, pes cavus, and bilaterally dislocated lenses, and demonstrates developmental delay with mild mental retardation. His mother is told that her child might benefit from folic acid supplementation.

Homocystinuria is an autosomal recessive condition caused by deficiencies of various enzymes involved in the pathway that converts methionine to cysteine. This results in the accumulation of homocysteine, which is then excreted in urine. In this condition, cysteine becomes an essential amino acid. Clinically, homocystinuria is manifested by mental retardation, osteoporosis, tall stature, kyphosis, lens subluxation, and atherosclerosis (causing premature stroke and myocardial infarction). Diagnosis is based on a positive nitroprusside cyanide test. Marfan syndrome is the primary differential diagnosis. Clinical features of homocystinuria, such as ectopia lentis, tall and thin body habitus, and chest and spinal deformities, are similar to the features found in patients with Marfan syndrome. However, generalized osteoporosis, arterial and venous thrombosis, premature atherosclerosis, changes in hair, and the disorders of mental development are absent in patients with Marfan syndrome.  \n\n【7】Answer A is incorrect. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is an X-linked recessive condition caused by a defect in the purine salvage pathway due to the absence of HGPRT (hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase), which converts hypoxanthine to inosine monophosphate and guanine to guanosine monophosphate. As a result, excess uric acid accumulates and causes hyperuricemia and gout. Patients also present with mental retardation, self-mutilating behavior, aggression, and choreoathetosis.  \n\n【8】Answer B is incorrect. Osteogenesis imperfecta is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a variety of gene defects that result in abnormal synthesis of type I collagen. Clinically, it is characterized by multiple fractures occurring with minimal trauma (“brittle bone disease”), blue sclerae due to the translucency of connective tissue over the choroid, hearing loss due to abnormal middle ear bones, and dental imperfections due to lack of dentition.  \n\n【9】Answer C is incorrect. Fragile X results from an expansion of the CGG trinucleotide repeat on the FMR-1 locus of the X chromosome. Methylation of these trinucleotide repeats will result in nonproduction of the FMR-1 protein, resulting in a phenotype that includes mental retardation, an elongated face, protruding ears, macro-orchidism, and low muscle tone. While children suffering from fragile X might exhibit the same developmental delays and mild retardation as the child in this vignette, they will not have pes cavus, arachnodactyly, and dislocated lenses, and folic acid supplementation will not help them.  \n\n【10】Answer D is incorrect. Chronic granulomatous disease is an X-linked recessive condition caused by a lack of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase activity within neutrophils. As a result, neutrophils can ingest bacteria but cannot kill them due to a defective oxidative burst.

She states that over the past several years， “he has become increasingly forgetful.”Initially， her father could not remember where he had left his wallet and keys from earlier in the day. Now she has to constantly remind him of what they have just discussed. While he used to be an avid storyteller， he has become much less gregarious of late. Most recently， she states that the neighbors found her father wandering around the block without an explanation of where he was going or from where he had just come.

Amyloid plaques are hard， insoluble plaques of protein frag-ments that form between neurons. Neurofibrillary tangles consist of insoluble microtubules that accumulate because of abnormal tau proteins.\n\n【8】Neurotransmitter： The oldest of the three major competing theories on the cause of the disease is the “cholinergic hypothesis，\"which posits that AD is caused by restricted biosynthesis of acetylcholine； thus acetylcholine would be the most deficient.\n\n【9】●Treatments： There is no definitive treatment for AD. Antipsychotic medica-tions or benzodiazepines may be administered to help treat certain behavioral disturbances common with AD.\n\n【10】CLINICAL CORRELATION\n\n【11】Alzheimer disease is the most common degenerative disorder of the brain， account-ing for 50% of all diagnosed dementias. It results in a relentlessly progressive cogni-tive decline. Initially， the individual exhibits forgetfulness with day-to-day occur-rences. Items may be frequently misplaced and appointments may go unattended. Following the establishment of memory loss， further cognitive decline becomes more evident. The patient may develop a halting manner to his or her speech because of the failure of recall of certain words. As the speech deficits increase， characteristics of expressive and/or receptive aphasias become more pronounced. Other cognitive difficulties include dyscalculia， disruption of visuospatial orientation， and ideational and ideomotor apraxias. The patient may eventually develop difficulty with loco-motion and may become confined to bed. The incidence and prevalence of AD increase with age. The majority of patients are over the age of 60， but AD has also been diagnosed in much younger patients. Certain forms of AD have a familial occurrence， but these account for less than 1 percent of all cases. The most well-described familial trends follow an autosomal dominant inheritance. The early onset of AD has also been linked with Down syndrome. The most important aspect of the diagnosis of AD is the exclusion of treatable forms of dementia. While imaging of the brain may demonstrate diffuse atrophy with thinning of the cerebral gyri and enlargement of the sulci and ventricles in the advanced stages， it is more important to identify mass lesions， such as chronic subdural hematomas， which may account for the symptoms. On histological specimens， AD is associated with the diffuse loss of neurons in the cerebral cortex. In particular， neuronal loss in the nucleus basalis of Meynert is associated with decreased levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcho-line. There are intracytoplasmic deposition of neurofibrillary tangles in neurons 删除换行1: composed of paired， helical filaments， immunoreactive for tau protein and neuritic plaques composed of paired， helical filaments of fibrillar beta amyloid. In the amy-loid hypothesis of AD， it was the deposition of fibrillar beta amyloid in the form of neuritic plaques which was believed to be the main cause of the progressive cogni-tive dysfunction. However， the spatial and temporal patterns of plaque formation did not correlate well with the level of cognitive decline. Newer research into the pathophysiology of AD points to the role of nonfibrillar amyloid beta peptide (A-B)， the precursor of neuritic plaques， accumulating in synapses. This has been termed the synaptic amyloid beta hypothesis. Amyloid precursor protein (APP)， a protein， is embedded in the membrane of the presynaptic terminal of the neuron. Cleavage of APP results in the release of A-B into the synapse， which acts as a synaptotoxin impairing glutaminergic transmission and compromising synaptic function. The elu-cidation of this new model of AD may point to the development of new therapeutic treatments in the future.\n\n【12】APPROACH TO：\n\n【13】Neural Synapses\n\n【14】OBJECTIVES\n\n【15】1\\.

On an average， a single neuron will receive approximately 1000 different synapses to pro-cess. In its simplest form， a synapse consists of the synaptic bouton or terminal， the terminal end of the axon； the synaptic cleft， the space between the presynaptic and postsynaptic cell； and the postsynaptic terminal. The postsynaptic terminal can b删除换行4: the dendrite or soma of another neuron or even a muscle fiber. The synaptic cleft is not simply an open space but instead is spanned by membrane proteins from both terminals， which form connections to maintain the distance between the two cells.\n删除3：<u>Figure 5-1. Schematic drawing of a synaptic terminal.</u>\n\n【25】There are two types of synapses in the nervous system， electrical and chemi-cal synapses. An electrical synapse is only 3-4 nm wide and the signal can travel bidirectionally， whereas the chemical synaptic cleft is much larger， measuring approximately 20-40 nm， with the signal traveling more slowly and in one direc-tion， either to another neuron or a muscle cell. The majority of synapses in the brain are chemical.\n\n【26】In an electrical synapse， the pre- and postsynaptic cells are connected via gap junctions that allow for communication of the cytoplasm of both cells， accounting for the short distance between the two cells. This provides a low-resistance pathway for the direct flow of electrical potential from one cell to the other. Action poten-tials that reach the presynaptic terminal directly depolarize the postsynaptic mem-brane. If the depolarization reaches the threshold for the postsynaptic membrane， an action potential can be generated and propagated through that cell.\n\n【27】The transmission of the electrical signal occurs through specialized proteins， which physically connect the two cells. Gap junctions consist of two sets of hemi-channels or connexons， one each on the pre- and postsynaptic cell membranes. Connexons are in turn composed of six identical， membrane-spanning protein sub-units called connexins. The connexins arrange in a radial array with an open central channel. Proteins on the extracellular side of the connexins identify and link with proteins on the postsynaptic connexins to form the complete conducting chan-nel. Like voltage-gated ion channels， gap junctions can undergo conformational changes to either open or close the channel depending upon the local milieu. These gap junctions allow for the nearly instantaneous transmission of electrical signal. Because of the nature of the synapse， the pre and postsynaptic membranes lie in very close apposition to one another.\n\n【28】Chemical synapses must convert an electrical signal， the action potential， into a chemical signal， neurotransmitter release， which diffuses across the synaptic cleft to affect the postsynaptic cell. The presynaptic terminal contains large numbers of membrane-bound vesicles. These synaptic vesicles are lined by specialized mem-brane proteins and are formed from the invagination of the membrane of the syn-aptic terminal. The vesicles contain proteins and amino acids manufactured from the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus in the soma and transported down the axon to the terminal via fast anterograde axonal transport by the action of kine sin association to microtubules. These neurotransmitters comprise the chemical messenger system of the nervous system and are concentrated in vesicles clustered around a region of the presynaptic terminal called the active zone. These vesicles remain in reserve until needed for secretion.\n\n【29】When an action potential reaches the terminal， it simply escapes through the ion channels in the presynaptic cell. However， it causes a series of reactions resulting in synaptic vesicles binding to the membrane of the presynaptic cell. Depolarization opens Ca’+ channels， allowing Ca+ to enter the axon terminal and phosphory-late the vesicle-binding protein synapsin， which frees the vesicle from the actin microfilaments and binds to the active zone. Vesicle and plasma membrane proteins undergo Ca+-dependent association and the vesicle fuses to the plasma membrane and releases neurotransmitters by exocytosis into the synaptic cleft. The vesicle membrane is recaptured from the synaptic terminal plasma membrane to prevent enlargement of the nerve ending and provide a constant supply of vesicles. The neurotransmitters then diffuse across the synaptic cleft and bind to receptors on the postsynaptic membrane.\n\n【30】Based upon the type of neurotransmitter and receptor， the chemical synapse can result in either an excitatory or inhibitory postsynaptic potential. Excitatory neu-rotransmitters result in a depolarization of the postsynaptic cell. Inhibitory neu-rotransmitters hyperpolarize the postsynaptic cell. Proteins such as dynein (which associates vesicle with microtubule) used for synaptic transmission are targeted and returned to cell body to be recycled through a process called slow retrograde axonal transport.\n\n【31】Based on their structural and functional characteristics in the nervous system， neurotransmitter receptors can be classified into two broad categories： metabotropic and inotropic receptors. Inotropic receptors form transmembrane ion channels that 删除换行1: open and allow transcellular flow of ions upon the binding of a chemical messenger(ligand)， as opposed to an electrical potential changes as with voltage-gated ion channels or mechanical changes as with stretch-activated ion channels. Metabo-tropic receptors， on the other hand， are indirectly linked with ion channels rather than forming them. Upon binding of a ligand， the metabotropic receptor leads to a cascade of intracellular signals， which then results in opening of the transmembrane ion channel. Because the transmission of the signal from the presynaptic cell to the postsynaptic cell relies on the diffusion of neurotransmitters， it is significantly slower than an electrical synapse. However， unlike an electrical synapse， the chemical syn-apse is capable of amplification of the initial signal. Many vesicles， each containing thousands of neurotransmitters， release their contents into the synaptic cleft. This process can lead to the activation of thousands of postsynaptic receptors following binding of the neurotransmitter. Transmission is terminated in the synapse by dif-fusion of the transmitter from the active zone by chemical degradation by enzymes in the synaptic cleft (eg， acetylcholinesterase) and reuptake of the neurotransmitter into pre- and postsynaptic neurons.\n\n【32】The development of the neural synapse relies partially on several specialized syn-aptic laminin glycoproteins. Laminin-11， concentrated in the synaptic cleft， acts as an inhibitor to Schwann cells in the neuromuscular junction to prevent them from entering into the cleft. This allows the pre- and postsynaptic cells to directly oppose one another and helps maintain the long-term stability of synapses and allows for the rapid transmission of information across the synaptic cleft. Laminin-B2 binds directly to calcium channels， which are critical for the release of neurotransmitters in the presynaptic membrane at the neuromuscular synapse. This leads to clustering of calcium channels and the recruitment of other presynaptic components to form the active zone of the presynaptic membrane. Perturbations of either of these synap-tic laminin glycoproteins may lead to the pathogenesis of synaptic disease.\n删除13：<u>CASE CORRELATES\n\n【33】●See Cases 1-10 (cellular and molecular neuroscience cases).\n</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 13:56:49", "endTime": "2024/09/14 13:57:05", "cost": 16.034}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:45:58", "update_time": "2024-09-13 21:57:05", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 21:56:49"}

Her blood pressure is 152/88 mm Hg. Further testing reveals protein in the urine as well as RBC casts. The rheumatologist orders a renal biopsy, which is shown in the image.

This patient has nephritis due to SLE. Up to 60% of adults with SLE eventually develop nephritis. Circulating immune complexes in the serum deposit in the glomerulus and activate complement, leading to leukocyte infiltration and membrane damage. Signs and symptoms can include proteinuria, hematuria, hypertension, and RBC casts in the urine sediment. Biopsy will show a characteristic “wire-loop” appearance along the glomerular membrane.  \n\n【6】Answer A is incorrect . Alport syndrome is an inherited connective tissue disorder that is diagnosed by the findings of hematuria, sensorineural deafness, and anterior bulging of the ocular lenses. Biopsy and visualization with electron microscopy would show a thickened basement membrane, with a split and distorted lamina densa.  \n\n【7】Answer B is incorrect . Membranous glomerulonephritis is a nephrotic syndrome that presents with heavy proteinuria, but not typically obvious hematuria. Other symptoms include edema, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. On biopsy light microscopy shows a uniform thickening of the basement membrane and electron microscopy shows subepithelial deposits.  \n\n【8】Answer C is incorrect . Minimal change disease is a nephropathy that occurs most often in the pediatric population, but it can also present in adults. The clinical presentation includes proteinuria, marked edema (especially periorbitally), hyperlipidemia, and hypoalbuminemia. Urinary sediment is usually acellular. On biopsy light microscopy reveals no obvious abnormality, but electron microscopy shows effacement of the foot processes along the epithelium.  \n\n【9】Answer D is incorrect . Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is typically seen a few weeks after a streptococcal infection causing pharyngitis or impetigo, and would present with similar symptoms of hematuria, RBC casts, hypertension, and headaches. However, histologic section of a renal biopsy would show hypercellularity of mesangial cells as well as subepithelial deposits of immunoglobulins and complement, giving a “humpy” appearance, rather than the wire-loop appearance seen in this patient’s biopsy specimen.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:39:25", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:39:30", "cost": 4.975}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:45:58", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:39:31", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:39:25"}

Multiple primary immunodeficiencies may underlie fungal infections in children and young adults. Endemic mycoses and cryptococcosis are observed in patients with defects of the interleukin (IL)-12/interferon (IFN)-y axis 删除25：<u></u> or with autoanti-bodies against IFN-y or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor(GM-CSF). Pneumocystosis is related to T-cell disorders， such as severe combined immunodeficiency 删除25：<u>(SCID； see Case 5)</u> and CD40 ligand deficiency 删除25：<u></u>. In this case， we focus on immune disorders that increase susceptibility to mucocuta-neous candidiasis.\n\n【4】Candida species are commonly part of normal mucocutaneous flora， but can also cause superficial or invasive candidiasis. Superficial infections can affect the mouth， esophagus， digestive and genital mucosa， nails， and skin. Persistence or recurrence of Candida infection at these sites is referred to as chronic mucocuta neous candidiasis (CMC). By contrast， invasive Candida disease affects viscera or other sterile sites， like blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Although the mucocutane-ous epithelium is the obligate port of entry to deeper infections， mucocutaneous disease and invasive disease are almost always mutually exclusive， which suggests that they have distinct immunopathogenic pathways.\n\n【5】Candidiasis is mostly caused by Candida albicans， a polyphenic yeast that changes its morphology based on environmental cues， primarily switching between a sin-gle-celled and a hyphal form. Each form expresses unique surface antigens that are recognized by only a subset of host cell receptors. The morphological and antigenic variation of Candida is necessary to produce human disease and different forms are detected in histopathological examination of mucocutaneous disease versus cultures from patients with invasive candidiasis. Therefore， morphological iden-tification of different Candida forms corresponds to distinct immunopathogenic defects in patients.\n\n【6】Marylin Cassedy is a 10-year-old female with a history of recurrent oral thrush and perineal candidiasis since age 2 and recurrent pneumonias and chronic diar-rhea since age 4. She had multiple immune studies between ages 4 and 7， which were significant for persistently low CD4+ lymphocyte counts (ranging from 350 to 删除换行1: 750 mul-1)， progressive development of impaired lymphocyte proliferation to mito-gens and antigens (including candida and tetanus)， and poor antibody titers.\n\n【7】At age 10， while continuing to suffer from CMC， she suddenly became pale and fatigued， and developed epistaxis.Laboratory tests revealed profound anemia (Hb： 3g di-1) and thrombocytopenia (platelet count：8x10\\).LDH was elevated at 950IU1 (normal values： 105-333 IU F-)， suggesting hemolysis. However， the Coombs test was negative. Nonetheless， she re LeSIceived intravenous pulse steroids along with red blood cell and platelet transfusions. After initial improvement， her anemia and thrombocytopenia relapsed， and persisted despite treatment with high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG； 1 g kg-). Moreover， she developed left-sided chest pain， fever， and cough. A chest X-ray showed left lower lobe pneumonia. She was referred to Children’s Hospital for possible immunodeficiency.Immunological investigations revealed an increased B cell count (CD19+： 6196 cells pl-l) and a normal T cell count (CD3\\： 4151 cells pF； CD4\\： 2096 cells pF；CD8\\： 1492 cells u.l-)， but the proportion of CD4+ CD25+ CD127 regulatory T (Treg) cells was mark-edly decreased (0.6% of CD4\\ cells， normal value：5-15%). She was diagnosed with IPEX-like syndrome.\n\n【8】Multiple attempts to control her immune dysregulation failed-including four doses of rituximab (anti-CD20 antibody)， twice daily anakinra (IL-1 receptor antagonist) and glucocorticoids-and she went on to develop bone marrow aplasia. Eventually use of anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) improved both her aplastic anemia and autoimmune cytopenias. The association of CMC and autoimmune cytopenias prompted her doctors to consider the possibility of gain-of-function (GOF) mutations of STAT1. Indeed， Marylin was found to carry a heterozygous mutation of the STAT1 gene， resulting in an amino acid substitution (E545K) in the linked domain of the molecule. She remains stable on anakinra， cyclosporine， and prednisone to prevent further activation of her immune system. She is also on anti-fungal and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis and on IVIG to keep her IgG levels>600 mg dl-l·\n\n【9】Increased susceptibility to Candida infections.\n\n【10】Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC) can occur in patients with no other infections or prominent clinical signs of immunodeficiency. These patients have a high fungal burden on their skin and mucosal surfaces， but their risk of developing disseminated candidiasis is low.\n\n【11】Genetic analysis of patients with CMC has revealed a role for the IL-23/IL-17/IL-22 axis (Th17 response) and Dectin-1 signaling in mucocutaneous immunity to C. albicans .\n\n【12】Complete autosomal recessive IL-17 receptor A (IL-17RA) and IL17RC， and par-tial autosomal dominant IL-17F deficiencies have been reported in patients with CMC . Signaling through the IL-17R involves ACT1 homodimeri-zation and interaction with the IL-17R， which promotes activation of the NF-KB and MAP kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways， leading to expression of IL-17 target genes in keratinocytes and epithelial cells. Ultimately， this results in production of defensins and other molecules with antifungal activity. Recently， biallelic ACT1mutations that abolish the homotypic interaction of ACT-1 with IL-17R have been reported in patients with CMC .\n\n【13】Heterozygous STAT1 missense gain-of-function (GOF) mutations represent the most common genetic defect underlying CMC . These mutations should not be confused with loss-of function STAT1 mutations， which increase susceptibility to mycobacterial and viral infections by altering cellular responses to IFN-y and IFN-a/B. By contrast， GOF STAT1 mutations cause an enhance删除换行4: response to IFN-a/B， IFN-Y， and IL-27， which represses IL-17 and IL-22 produc-tion， and results in a reduced Th17 response .\n删除3：<u>Fig. 52.1 Signaling pathways important in anti-candidal immunity. In response to Candida infection， the Dectin-1 receptor binds to p-glucan present in cell walls of Candida species， and induces NF-KB activation through signaling via the CARD9/Bcl-10/MALT1 complex. This promotes secretion of IL-1β， IL-6， and IL-23， which promote differentiation of Th17 cells. STAT3 and RORyT play a critical role in this process. Th17 cells secrete IL-17 and IL-22. These cytokines bind to their specific receptors， activate an Act-1-dependent signaling pathway， and induce expression of IL-17/IL-22-dependent genes， such as B-defensins， thereby contributing to anti-Candida responses. The molecules found to be mutated in patients with susceptibility to Candida infections are indicated in red and bold. Moreover， STAT3-dependent Th17 differentiation is inhibited by STAT1 gain-of-function mutations. Finally， neutralizing anti-IL-17 antibodies have been demonstrated in patients with APECED due to AIRE mutations， and in patients with thymoma. Consequently， these patients frequently suffer from chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis.</u>\n\n【14】Patients with STAT1 GOF mutations develop CMC at a mean age of 1.4 years， especially in the oropharynx (98%)， nails (58%)， skin (46%)， and esophagus (20%). Although CMC is the most common manifestation of altered anti-fungal immune response in patients with STAT1 GOF mutations， extensive superficial fungal infec-tions， recurrent skin fusariosis， and even invasive fungal infections (including coccidioidomycosis and histoplasmosis) have also been observed. Furthermore， autoimmune manifestations (such as autoimmune thyroiditis， cytopenias， and enteropathy) have been observed frequently， and may resemble IPEX 删除25：<u></u>， as in the patient described here. The mechanisms underlying IPEX-like disease in patients with STAT1 GOF mutations， however， remain unclear.\n\n【15】CMC frequently accompanies acquired conditions such as HIV infection， immu-nosuppressive therapies， prolonged antibiotic therapies， and diabetes melli-tus. However， CMC is also seen in various inherited primary T cell deficiencies， including hyper-IgE syndrome 删除25：<u></u> and APECED 删除25：<u>(autoimmune poly-endocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy； see Case 17)</u>. Patients with hyper-IgE syndrome due to dominant negative STAT3 mutations have a defect in IL-17-producing Th17 cells . Patients with APECED develop neu-tralizing antibodies against IL-17A， IL-17F， and IL-22. Autoantibodies against Th17 cytokines are also detected in patients with thymoma， who frequently suffer from CMC. The very high incidence of CMC in patients with defects in their Th17response suggests that patients treated with Th17 inhibitors should also receive prophylactic antifungal medications to prevent these infections.\n\n【16】Invasive candidiasis utilizes different pathophysiology mechanisms compared with CMC. Candidemia is the fourth most common cause of nosocomial blood-stream infections in the United States and the most frequent invasive fungal disease in Western countries. Invasive candidiasis has a 40% mortality rate. It is frequently observed in patients with severe neutropenia， in patients admitted to intensive care units with catheters and treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics， and in patients receiving parenteral nutrition. Functional defects of neutrophils， such as leukocyte adhesion deficiency syndrome type 1 删除25：<u>(LAD1； see Case 27)</u> and chronic granulomatous disease 删除25：<u>(CGD； see Case 26)</u>， are also characterized by an increased risk for invasive candidiasis. However， all of these conditions involve a broader susceptibility to infections. Genetic defects that cause selective suscepti-bility to invasive fungal infections have been reported recently.\n\n【17】Dectin-1 is a C-type lectin receptor that recognizes B-glucans， which are present in the cell wall of Candida species， and thereby promotes anti-fungal immune responses. Reports that nonsense mutations of Dectin-1 are associated with 删除换行1: increased incidence of superficial candidiasis have been dismissed， since it was recognized that this is a common polymorphism in humans.\n\n【18】In contrast， CARD9 mutations are responsible for invasive candidiasis . CARD9 is an adaptor molecule that is expressed in myeloid cells down-stream from the C-type lectin receptors (Dectin-1， Dectin-2， and macrophage-inducible C-type lectin)， which recognize fungal pathogen-associated molecular patterns. In response to fungal recognition through these receptors， protein kinase C(PKC)-8 mediates phosphorylation of the coiled-coiled domain of CARD9， allow-ing interaction of CARD9 with B-cell lymphoma/leukemia (BCL)-10 protein and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation 1 (MALT1) pro-tein， resulting in NF-KB activation and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. Patients with autosomal recessive CARD9 deficiency are at high risk for both CMC and invasive central nervous system (CNS) candidiasis. These patients have a reduced number of IL-17 secreting T cells， and their neutrophils display impaired proinflammatory cytokine release in response to Candida stimulation in vitro. Furthermore， CARD9-deficient neutrophils have an abnormal phagolysosome function upon contact with C. albicans. The preferential CNS location of Candida infection in CARD9-deficient patients may reflect an inability of microglial cells to eliminate Candida efficiently and they may also act as a source ofentry to the CNS. Finally， the clinical manifestations of CARD9 deficiency are not restricted to CMC and candida meningitis sepsis. They also include deep cutaneous andlymph node dermatophytosis， such as those due to Tinea corporis， Tinea capitis， Trichophyton rubrum， and Trichophyton violaceum.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:42:45", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:43:20", "cost": 34.996}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:45:58", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:43:19", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:42:43"}

Of the surgical options listed， percutaneous pinning is the least invasive option in the setting of nondisplaced fractures. Regardless of displace-ment， closed reduction with internal fixation is the recommended choice of treatment in this age group.

Patients with intracapsular pathology of the hip tend to hold their extremi-ties in a position of external rotation and flexion. This patient has suffered subcapital fracture of the femoral neck， which is an intracapsular injury， thus resulting in hematoma formation and increased pressure within the hip socket. In a position of external rotation and flexion， the volume of the hip socket is greatest， and thus patients find relative comfort in this position. Additionally， children with septic arthritis of the hip will assume this position， as pain from pressurized inflammatory responses is similarly minimized.\n\n【19】In the absence of absolute medical contraindications to surgery， the great majority of hip fractures are treated operatively.\n\n【20】Despite significant improvements in the ability to surgically treat hip frac-tures and manage medical comorbidities， the mortality of hip fractures in patients ≥ 80 years of age is upward of 30% within 1 year from fracture.\n删除20：<u>Buchholz RW， Court-Brown CM， Heckman JD， Tornetta P， eds.

He is blind and has peripheral neuropathy with sensory loss in both feet, and his most recent hemoglobin A1c level was 13.9%. He recently presented with altered mental status, polyuria, and polydipsia. At that time, his serum glucose level was 475 mg/dL, arterial blood pH was 6.96, and his anion gap was 27. Since then his acidosis has resolved with appropriate treatment, and fingerstick blood glucose levels have normalized. However, he has persistent nasal discharge; paranasal sinus tenderness; and new onset of periorbital edema, proptosis, facial numbness, and obtundation.

A feared infectious complication seen in patients with longstanding diabetic ketoacidosis is invasive rhi-nocerebral mucormycosis. As in this case, this infection leads to persistent sinusitis with inevitable invasion into adjacent neural structures such as the trigeminal nerve and the frontal lobe. Rhizopus organisms thrive in serum containing high glucose levels and low pH. Other conditions predisposing patients to this aggressive infection include iron overload/chelator treatment, AIDS, immunosuppression due to prolonged steroid use, and hematologic malignancies. Under the microscope, Mucor species appear as irregular, broad, nonseptate hyphae with 90-degree branching. Both Mucor and Rhizopus species can cause this condition.  \n\n【7】Answer A is incorrect . Aspergillus species appear microscopically as 45-degree angle branching, septate hyphae with rare fruiting bodies. Invasive Aspergillus infection occurs mainly after prolonged profound immunosuppression (as in patients with AIDS or cancer or in individuals with chronic granulomatous disease) and typically leads to bronchopulmonary aspergillosis with cavitary lesions in the lung.  \n\n【8】Answer B is incorrect . Cryptococcus species appear as 5- to 10-μm yeasts with a wide capsular halo. These infections represent an important opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS, causing cryptococcal meningitis. Cryptococcal infections are extremely rare in patients with normal CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts.  \n\n【9】Answer C is incorrect . Blastomycetes species appear as broad-based, budding, dimorphic fungi. Blastomycosis is mainly a pulmonary infection, endemic to states east of the Mississippi River and Central America. Infection of the lung leads to polygranulomatous infection with frequent hematogenous dissemination. These fungal species are cultured on Sabouraud agar.  \n\n【10】Answer E is incorrect . Candidal species appear microscopically as pseudohyphae with budding yeasts. Candidal infections are more common in patients with poorly controlled diabetes, but they rarely cause invasive rhino-cerebral infections as described in this patient.

Understand that stroke occurs in patients of all ages.\n\n【12】2\\. Recognize the less typical stroke etiologies that often affect younger patients.\n\n【13】3\\. Be familiar with the diagnostic workup of stroke in the young patient.\n\n【14】##### Considerations\n\n【15】The clinical diagnosis of a stroke relies on the appropriate clinical history, neurologic findings, and supportive brain imaging studies. Although the majority of strokes occur in patients 65 years of age or older, tens of thousands of strokes per year nonetheless occur in patients 55 years of age or younger in the United States. Just as in older patients, the clinical suspicion of stroke should come to the forefront when focal neurologic deficits emerge acutely. This particular patient underwent a “choke hold,” which injured the right carotid artery, leading to ischemia to the right frontal aspect of the brain and associated carotid structures.\n\n【16】### APPROACH TO: Stroke in a Young Patient\n\n【17】#### DEFINITIONS\n\n【18】CAROTID DISSECTION: A tear in the carotid arterial wall that can result in luminal obstruction, thromboembolic complications, and/or pseudoaneurysm formation. Dissections can also occur in the vertebral arteries, or less commonly, the large intracranial arteries.\n\n【19】PATENT FORAMEN OVALE: A persistent opening in the interatrial septum associated with paradoxical embolism in patients with cryptogenic stroke.\n\n【20】ARTERIOVENOUS MALFORMATIONS: Congenital high-pressure, high-flow cerebral vascular malformations characterized by direct arteriovenous shunting.\n\n【21】#### CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【22】The diagnostic evaluation in a younger stroke patient is more extensive because the likelihood is greater of a nonatherosclerotic etiology. Some of these are discussed below. The workup may include a brain MRI, cerebral angiography or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the intracranial and cervical vessels, transesophageal echocardiogram, and laboratory studies including lipid panel, homocysteine, protein C, protein S, antithrombin III, anticardiolipin antibody, lupus anticoagulant, factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin gene mutation, and a toxicology screen. Other studies that can be indicated in the appropriate clinical setting might include lumbar puncture, HIV serology, blood cultures, vasculitis serologies, and screening for sickle cell disease.\n\n【23】#### ETIOLOGIES AND CLINICAL PRESENTATIONS\n\n【24】The same causes of stroke in older patients can affect younger adults, especially in younger patients who possess the traditional atherosclerotic risk factors of hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. The largest categories of stroke in the general population are cardioembolic, large-vessel atherothrombotic, and lacunar. A patent foramen ovale (PFO) is detectable in approximately 15% to 30% of the general population, but its prevalence is higher in young patients with cryptogenic ischemic stroke. The mechanism is presumed to be paradoxical embolism. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is the most common way to detect a PFO, although its sensitivity is impaired by the need to sedate a patient for the exam. Alternatively, transcranial Doppler bubble testing is highly sensitive for a right-to-left cardiac shunt, but may result in false positives from a noncardiac source, such as a pulmonary AVM. Atrial septal aneurysms are also linked to cryptogenic stroke and best evaluated by TEE.\n\n【25】Craniocervical dissection is commonly but not always preceded by head or neck trauma such as a motor vehicle accident, chiropractic neck manipulation, or a bout of severe coughing, vomiting, or sneezing . Dissections can present with headache or thromboembolic cerebrovascular events. Carotid dissection is often associated with a Horner syndrome , that is, ipsilateral ptosis and miosis. Fibro-muscular dysplasia, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, and Marfan syndrome are predisposing factors to spontaneous craniocervical dissection.\n\n【26】通用删除2(英):<u>删除3：<u>Figure 13–1 . Cerebral arteriogram of internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection. 通用删除1(英):<u>( Reproduced, with permission, from Brunicardi FC, et al . Schwartz’s Principles of Surgery, 8th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Publishers, 2004:Fig. 22–92 .)</u></u></u>\n\n【27】Arteriovenous malformations and the lower-flow cavernous angiomas are associated with intracerebral hemorrhage as well as seizures and other neurologic presentations. Moyamoya disease is an idiopathic noninflammatory cerebral vasculopathy characterized by progressive occlusion of the large arteries at the circle of Willis, most commonly the distal internal carotid artery. The characteristic moyamoya vessels refer to the small penetrating arteries that hypertrophy in response to chronic cerebral ischemia.\n\n【28】Drugs of abuse, especially cocaine and amphetamines, are associated with both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Oral contraceptives are a risk factor for thromboembolic stroke, especially in women over 35 who smoke. A history of intravenous drug abuse should raise the suspicion of endocarditis and HIV disease. Other rarer infectious etiologies of stroke include tuberculous meningitis and varicella zoster.\n\n【29】Hypercoagulable conditions can predispose to stroke. These include malignancy, antiphospholipid antibodies, protein C deficiency, protein S deficiency, anti-thrombin III deficiency, factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin gene mutation, and hyperhomocysteinemia. Some of these entities are most clearly linked to venous thromboembolism, which is particularly relevant to patients with cerebral venous thrombosis or a PFO.\n\n【30】##### Treatment\n\n【31】Treatment is tailored to the specific stroke etiology. Antithrombotic drugs are a mainstay of therapy for most patients with ischemic stroke. Very few randomized clinical trials have been performed to help guide the choice of antiplatelet or anticoagulant treatment for the specific stroke subtypes discussed above. One such trial revealed no significant difference between aspirin and warfarin in patients with ischemic stroke associated with an antiphospholipid antibody. Similar studies comparing aspirin to anticoagulation in cervical artery dissection have shown no significant difference in efficacy.\n\n【32】Endovascular closure of PFO is currently under investigation and not recommended outside of a clinical trial. Because a substantial proportion of carotid or vertebral dissections spontaneously recanalize, stenting is usually reserved for patients who show no vessel recanalization after 3 to 6 months or who have unstable appearing psuedoaneurysms. The treatment of arteriovenous malformations can employ a combination of surgery, radiation, and endovascular therapies. Surgical revascularization procedures such as encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis or superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) bypass are frequently performed for moyamoya disease.\n\n【33】####", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:31:41", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:31:57", "cost": 16.025}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:45:58", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:31:57", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:31:40"}

She is rushed to delivery because of signs of preeclampsia. After a cesarean section delivery, the newborn baby is noted to have signs of cyanosis, tachypnea, and dyspnea. Which of the following is a characteristic of the substance that is insufficient in the baby?\n\n【1】> (A) It consists primarily of sphingomyelin\n\n【2】> (B) It decreases compliance of small alveoli\n\n【3】> (C) It disrupts liquid intermolecular forces in alveoli\n\n【4】> (D) It increases the surface tension of alveoli\n\n【5】> (E) It is produced by type I pneumocytes in alveoli\n\n【6】> (F) It lines medium-sized bronchi, not alveoli\n\n【7】 Answer: The correct answer is C . This neonate is suffering from neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS) caused by a lack of surfactant. Surfactant is formed relatively late in fetal life (begins at 28 weeks and is produced most abundantly at 34 weeks). It reduces surface tension by disrupting the intermolecular forces (hydrogen bonds) between molecules of water. This prevents small alveoli from collapsing and increases compliance. Synthesis of surfactant is decreased by insulin. Thus, maternal diabetes is also a risk factor for RDS in infants, because fetal hyperglycemia stimulates an increased release of insulin. Cortisol increases synthesis of surfactant; therefore, women who have to deliver their babies prematurely typically receive glucocorticoids to help prevent RDS in their infants.  \n\n【8】Answer A is incorrect . Surfactant consists primarily of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (lecithin), the main lipid component, not sphingo-myelin.  \n\n【9】Answer B is incorrect . Surfactant prevents small alveoli from collapsing by decreasing alveolar surface tension. The compliance in small alveoli is increased (not decreased), allowing the lung to inflate more easily and decreasing the work of breathing.  \n\n【10】Answer D is incorrect . Surfactant is a lipoprotein consisting of both a hydrophobic and hydrophilic region. It reduces alveolar surface tension by adsorbing to the air-water interface—the hydrophilic portion interfering with the hydrogen bonds between molecules of water and the hydrophilic portion facing the air. Decreasing surface tension prevents small alveoli from collapsing.  \n\n【11】Answer E is incorrect . Type II pneumocytes secrete pulmonary surfactant and serve as precursors to both type I and type II pneumocytes. Type I pneumocytes make up 97% of the alveolar surface and are thin, squamous cells optimal for gas diffusion.  \n\n【12】Answer F is incorrect .

Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory process that involves an exaggerated Th1 immune response of unknown etiology. It generally causes respiratory symptoms, with the appearance of hilar lymphadenopathy and noncaseating granulomas in the lungs, but can affect any organ system. Acute sarcoidosis can develop suddenly over a period of weeks, with both constitutional and respiratory symptoms. The Heerfordt-Waldenström syndrome of acute sarcoidosis includes the development of fever, parotid enlargement, anterior uveitis, and facial nerve palsy, as seen in this patient. Of the neurologic symptoms seen in sarcoidosis, seventh nerve involvement is the most common.  \n\n【6】Answer A is incorrect. Lyme disease is a multisystem infection caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi , carried by the Ixodes scapularis tick. Within the first few weeks after an infected bite, patients may develop erythema migrans at the site of the bite and additional annular lesions. They may also display symptoms of cardiac and neurologic involvement, including first-degree heart block, myopericarditis, meningitis, cerebellar ataxia, and seventh nerve facial palsy. In addition, patients often experience a migratory musculoskeletal pain. They do not, however, experience respiratory or ocular symptoms.  \n\n【7】Answer B is incorrect. Pneumonia is an infection of the lung involving the alveoli, interstitia, and distal airways whereupon the alveoli become consolidated with WBCs, RBCs, and fibrin. The patient with pneumonia may have fever, cough, and an increased respiratory rate, as this patient does. However, physical exam would display findings of dullness to percussion in a lobar distribution in addition to other breath sounds such as wheezes or râles, and findings would be unlikely to be bilateral. Coughing often produces sputum.  \n\n【8】Answer D is incorrect. SLE is an autoimmune disease in which circulating antibodies and immune complexes cause systemic damage to the body. SLE is most prevalent in women and African-American people. Symptoms can affect all organ systems and cause polyarthritis, malar rash, nephritis, vascular occlusions, and pericarditis. Neurologic symptoms include headache, cognitive dysfunction, seizures, and myelopathy, but seventh nerve involvement is not particularly common. Pulmonary symptoms usually manifest as a pleuritis with or without pleural effusion, but one would not see granulomas on radiography.  \n\n【9】Answer E is incorrect. TB is caused by the acid-fast bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis , which produces a primary infection of the lungs. Symptoms include fever, night sweats, malaise, weakness, and dry cough. Radiography may reveal paratracheal or hilar lymphadenopathy, as in this patient. However, while it is possible that her nonpulmonary symptoms may occur with extrapulmonary TB, her purified protein derivative test is negative, making it less likely that she has been exposed to the bacterium.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:16:03", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:16:07", "cost": 4.297}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:45:57", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:16:07", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:16:03"}

Physical examination reveals extensive eruptive xanthomas and hepatosplenomegaly. A blood sample reveals milky plasma. Which of the following is the most likely lipoprotein to be elevated in this patient’s plasma?\n\n【1】A. Chylomicrons\n\n【2】B. Chylomicron remnants\n\n【3】C. HDL\n\n【4】D. IDL\n\n【5】E. LDL\n\n【6】Answer: 35.1 A . This patient presents with classical symptoms of hypertriglyceridemia: milky plasma, eruptive xanthomas, enlarged liver and spleen, and symptoms of pancreatitis. The milky plasma is due to abnormally high chylomicron levels, indicating that TG is not being removed from the transporter of dietary TG and it is accumulating in the plasma. The other lipoproteins listed have low levels of TG are much smaller and would not be expected to lead to milky plasma if elevated.\n\n【7】Question: 35.2 Laboratory results for a patient with uncontrolled type 1 diabetes mellitus reveal hyperglycemia (634 mg/dL) and hypertriglyceridemia (498 mg/dL). The most likely cause of the hypertriglyceridemia in this patient is which of the following?\n\n【8】A. Deficiency in apoprotein C-II\n\n【9】B. Increased hepatic triglyceride synthesis\n\n【10】C. Decreased lipoprotein lipase activity\n\n【11】D. Deficiency in LDL receptors\n\n【12】E. Absence of hormone sensitive lipase\n\n【13】Answer: 35.2 C . Decreased lipoprotein lipase activity is the result of the failure of the pancreatic β cells to produce and secrete insulin. Insulin stimulates the synthesis of lipoprotein lipase; in the absence of insulin, lipoprotein lipase activity in the capillary beds is low. While a deficiency in apoC-II would also lead to hypertriglyceridemia, this genetic defect is rare. If a patient with type I diabetes mellitus is not given insulin, then the increased glucagon–insulin ratio would stimulate gluconeogenesis and β oxidation in the liver rather than synthesis of triglycerides. Neither a deficiency of LDL receptors nor hormone-sensitive lipase would be expected to increase circulating TG levels.\n\n【14】Question: 35.3 A 25-year-old woman was referred to a lipid research center for investigation of moderate hypertriglyceridemia because the plasma lipid and lipoprotein profiles showed abnormalities. Both HDL and LDL were more buoyant and showed elevations in TG content with the mass of TG approximately the same as that of cholesterol. A deficiency in which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient’s lipid abnormality?\n\n【15】A. Lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase\n\n【16】B. Lipoprotein lipase\n\n【17】C. Apoprotein C-II\n\n【18】D. Hepatic lipase\n\n【19】E. Apoprotein B-100\nAnswer: 35.3 D . Hepatic lipase. The abnormal buoyancies of the LDL and HDL fractions due to their increased TG content indicate that IDL is not being processed to LDL and HDL is not being remodeled. Both of these processes are accomplished by hepatic lipase. A deficiency in lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase would lead to elevated serum cholesterol levels, almost all as free cholesterol. Deficiencies in lipoprotein lipase or apoC-II would lead to hypertriglyceridemia as increased chylomicrons and/or VLDL. An apoB-100 deficiency would lead to increased levels of LDL, but they would have the normal TG/cholesterol ratio.\n\n【20】BIOCHEMISTRY PEARLS\n\n【21】 TGs are safely transported in the bloodstream packaged into lipoproteins called chylomicrons or VLDLs.\n\n【22】 The most common genetic defect leading to hypertriglyceridemia is a deficiency in lipoprotein lipase, which results in increased levels of both chylomicrons and VLDL.\n\n【23】 Individuals who are homozygous for the defective gene for lipoprotein lipase usually present with symptoms of chylomicronemia (TG levels > 2000 mg/dL, abdominal pain, pancreatitis, xanthomas, lipemia retinalis) in childhood.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:20:53", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:21:52", "cost": 59.416}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:45:57", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:21:53", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:20:52"}

The differential diagnosis  删除换行1: is conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,  删除换行1: anxiety, depression, social phobia, substance misuse, learning disability and any combina删除8：<u>￾</u>tion of these disorders. He may have callous unemotional traits. As with most child mental  删除换行1: health problems, conduct disorder has a multifactorial aetiology. Exposure to the antisocial  删除换行1: behaviour of a caregiver is a particularly important risk factor. Children with conduct disor删除8：<u>￾</u>der appear to be overrepresented in lower socioeconomic groups.\n\n【14】While most clinicians are keen to avoid pathologizing young people with diagnostic labels,  删除换行1: the classification systems recognize that certain patterns of severe behaviour have significant  删除换行1: consequences for child, family, community and prognosis. Conduct disorder is a repetitive  删除换行1: and persistent pattern of behaviours in which the rights of others are violated or there is age删除8：<u>￾</u>inappropriate violation of societal norms lasting at least 6 months. The behaviours include  删除换行1: unusually severe and frequent outbursts that are developmentally inappropriate, argumenta删除8：<u>￾</u>tive, not compliant with authority, hostile and angry, untruthful and may include aggression,  删除换行1: physical cruelty to animals, vandalism, truancy, criminal activity and bullying. This list is  删除换行1: not exhaustive.\n\n【15】While ICD-10 defines conduct disorder in terms of socialized, unsocialized or confined to the  删除换行1: home context, more recent research suggests a subdivision of two subtypes: childhood-onset  删除换行1: type which has onset before the age of 10 years, and adolescent-onset type with no conduct  删除换行1: problems before this age. This is reflected in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental \n\n【16】Disorders (DSM) criteria which differ from those of ICD. The childhood-onset type is often  删除换行1: very difficult to treat. It is long-standing and is usually associated with psychosocial adversity  删除换行1: and poor parenting. It has a worse prognosis than short-lived adolescent problems, where  删除换行1: behaviours may be reflective of adolescent development such as risk taking and experiment删除8：<u>￾</u>ing (e.g. with drugs). In many this behaviour does not persist. Harming animals is a particu删除8：<u>￾</u>larly worrying feature. In general, most children and young people with conduct disorder do  删除换行1: not go on to become antisocial adults, but most antisocial adults have had conduct problems  删除换行1: when younger.\n\n【17】Conduct disorder is a difficult disorder to treat and there are high levels of co-morbidity such  删除换行1: as low mood. This should be excluded. There is little evidence to justify the use of medication  删除换行1: to control aggression. For childhood-onset type, parenting programmes should be used as  删除换行1: early as practicable, as negative ineffective parenting may perpetuate the problems. Family  删除换行1: therapy, support and behaviour modification may help. The young man may benefit from a  删除换行1: positive relationship with a male.

Since 01/30/2020, the patient has no obvious causes of fatigue, shortness of breath, pain in the joints of the body (presumably the patient should have a fever at that time), no cough, no chest tightness, poor appetite, and loose stools 1–2 times/day. Treatment with anti-infectives for upper airway infection was given continuously for 5 days (the specific treatment plan was unknown) in the local community hospital, and the condition of the disease had been not relieved. Then, the patient visited the Union Hospital affiliated to Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology on 02/06. The chest CT revealed viral pneumonia, and the laboratory examination showed hypersensitive C-reactive protein (CRP) of 75.47 mg/L, white blood cells of 4.68 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, neutrophils absolute value of 3.74 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, lymphocytes absolute value of 0.79 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, neutrophil percentage of 80%, and lymphocyte percentage of 16.9%. The new coronavirus nucleic acid throat swab was positive. Therefore, this disease was considered to be COVID-19. The patient isolated at home, took oral medicine (specific drug unknown) and waited for admission. During the period of isolation at home, the conditions of the patient worsened progressively, and she appeared to have mental malaise, wheezing, dyspnea, shortness of breath, and fatigue. The patient was transferred to our hospital on 02/09/2020 20:43 and diagnosed with “viral pneumonia”.\n\n【10】Past history: She denied history of chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and coronary heart disease previously. She had no history of surgical trauma, no history of contact with the South China seafood market, and no history of family members suffering from pneumonia recently. She denied history of drug allergies.\n\n【11】### Patient’s Condition on Admission\n\n【12】From the onset of this disease, the patient suffered from low energy, fatigue, dyspnea and tachypnea, shortness of breath, dryness of the mouth, mental malaise, poor appetite, and poor sleep. She had dry stools in the recent 2 days and no discharge. Her body weight decreased.\n\n【13】The tongue was pale and dark, and the coating was yellow and thick .

On 02/10, during the morning ward rounds, the patient had low energy, shortness of breath while moving, and oxygen saturation of 73% without oxygen inhalation and 90% when receiving oxygen through a face mask, which suggested a critical condition. ECG monitoring was done, the heart rate was 100 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 170/70 mmHg. The tongue was pale and dark. The coating was yellow, thick, and greasy.\n\n【22】The coating was yellow, thick, and greasy, mainly in the middle and the root of tongue 通用删除1(英):<u>(shown in Figure 2-5-2 )</u>. The pulse manifestation was deep, thready, and rapid. Treatment with high-frequency humidified oxygen inhalation was given immediately (oxygen concentration of 100%, oxygen flow of 50 liters per minute), and the finger oxygen saturation was maintained in the range of 95–97%. COVID-19 is mainly a type I respiratory failure, and the oxygenation capacity of both the lungs is reduced. Thereby, treatment with oxygen therapy to maintain adequate oxygenation is the most basic and key therapy for COVID-19. The choice of oxygen therapy starts from the nasal catheter, of which the maximum flow rate is approximately 10 liters per minute, and the mask inhalation is also the same. If the nasal catheter and mask cannot maintain the basic finger oxygen saturation above 95%, treatment with high-frequency humidification oxygen should be given as soon as possible. If this therapy could maintain the basic finger oxygen saturation, treatment with endotracheal intubation is not recommended actively. Because endotracheal intubation needs to open the lungs and respiratory tract, which means an increased risk of infection, critical and severe patients with endotracheal intubation have a poor prognosis.\n\n【23】删除3：<u>Figure 2-5-2.

Treatment with nifedipine sustained release tablets 30 mg orally once a day was administrated to control blood pressure.\n\n【35】### TCM Treatment Strategies\n\n【36】In this case, the syndrome differentiation of TCM was damp-heat, mainly heat. Although the patient had no fever, the symptoms including dry lips, a yellow, thick and greasy coating of the tongue, and less fluid indicated that the impairment of fluid was caused by heat. In the treatment, 50 ml of Xue Bi Jing injection matched with 100 ml of saline was given by means of intravenous infusion twice a day to remove blood stasis and toxin. Xue Bi Jing injection is mainly made from Hong Hua ( Carthami Flos ), Chi Shao ( Paeoniaeradix Rubra ), Chuan Xiong ( Chuanxiong Rhizoma ), Dan Shen ( Salviae miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma ), and Dang Gui ( Angelicae Sinensis Radix ), which is able to remove blood stasis and toxin. Modern pharmacological research revealed that Xue Bi Jing injection had the pharmacological effects of regulating inflammatory and coagulating responses. Therefore, it may help to relieve the systemic inflammation induced by infection. The reasons for using Xue Bi Jing injection were as follows: First, the patient was diagnosed with severe pneumonia, with an abnormally high inflammatory profile, such as serum ferritin over 1,000 ng/ml (according to the clinical observation, this index is positively correlated with the severity of the disease, and the prognosis is relatively poor when serum ferritin is more than 1,000 ng/ml.), and the level of C-reactive protein was also high, which were consistent with the systemic inflammatory response. Second, injury of fluid due to excessive heat and homogeny of fluid and blood inevitably affected circulation. So, the patient had dark and dry lips and a dull tongue, which were the manifestations that yin and blood could not nourish the body, thus requiring approaches to promote circulation and remove blood stasis. Third, the hands and feet of the patient were cold, which was also a manifestation of local microcirculation disorders. Treatment with the prescription of Hua Shi Bai Du Granule orally was given. This was a patient with the type of critical and severe COVID-19 and retention of damp-heat in the interior. Hua Shi Bai Du Granule could be used directly. The prescription Hua Shi Bai Du Fang unites the strategies from several classic formulas. It was put forward by the practitioners in the first national Chinese medicine medical teams when they provided medical service in the Jinyintan Hospital and Dongxihu Square Cabin Hospital. By “rescuing while concluding”, they gradually learned from practicing and came up with this new formula. Basic research results showed that the prescription could reduce the lung viral load by 30%, while relieving inflammatory response and regulating immune system. Besides, it can clear and diffuse lung-heat, eliminate dampness, and expel poison in the clinical application. The formula was as follows:\n\n【37】Sheng Shi Gao (raw Gypsum Fibrosum ) 30 g, Sheng Ma Huang (raw Ephedrae Herba ) 6 g, Xing Ren ( Armeniacae Semen Amarum ) 9 g, Gan Cao ( Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma ) 6 g, Huo Xiang ( Pogostemonis Herba ) 10 g (in later), Hou Po ( Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex ) 10 g, Cang Zhu ( Atractylodis Rhizoma ) 15 g, Cao Guo ( Tsaoko Fructus ) 10 g, Fa Ban Xia ( Pinelliae Rhizoma Preparatum ) 9 g, Fu Ling ( Poria ) 15 g, Sheng Da Huang (raw Rhei Radix et Rhizoma ) 5 g (in later), Sheng Huang Qi (raw Astragali Radix ) 10 g, Ting Li Zi ( Descurainiae Semen ) 10 g, Chi Shao ( Paeoniaeradix Rubra ) 10 g.\n\n【38】This was a critical and severe patient. In order to increase the efficacy of the drug and cut off the course of the disease, the above prescription was given orally for 3 consecutive days, 3 times a day, 1 dose per day.\n\n【39】On day 4 of admission, the patient was conscious, had low energy, normal body temperature, and defecated the previous day. The patient complained of shortness of breath after activities, which was better than that on admission. Food was taken with the help of paramedics (The time without oxygen inhalation could not be too long). There was no abdominal pain and no diarrhea. SpO <sub>2 </sub> was 96% (high flow oxygen inhalation 50 liters per minute, oxygen concentration 100%). Physical examination revealed that the heart rate was 98 beats per minute and the blood pressure 140/80mmHg. The tongue was light red with little fluid, and the coating was thin, yellow, and slightly dry . The pulse manifestation was deep and thready.\n\n【40】删除3：<u>Figure 2-5-4. The tongue manifestation on 02/13.</u>\n\n【41】Note : The tongue was light red with little fluid, and the coating was thin, yellow, and slightly dry.\n\n【42】The patient was enrolled in a clinical study on Remdesivir on that day. Because it was a double-blind study, we had no idea which group she was allocated. We continued sparing no efforts in saving her life with our initial treating strategies.\n\n【43】The coating revealed that the heat receded and yin and fluid were still insufficient. In this situation, the Evil Qi was still flourishing and the Healthy Qi was deficient. Based on Hua Shi Bai Du Fang, Chinese herbs of tonifying qi and nourishing yin were added slightly. Bai He ( Lilii Bulbus ) replenishes qi and nourishes yin, Mai Dong ( Ophiopogon japonicus ) nourishes yin and clears the heart. The above Chinese herbs could be used together to achieve the effects of detoxification, replenishing qi, nourishing yin, strengthening spleen, and removing dampness. The formula was as follows:\n\n【44】Sheng Shi Gao (raw Gypsum Fibrosum ) 30 g, Sheng Ma Huang (raw Ephedrae Herba ) 6 g, Xing Ren ( Armeniacae Semen Amarum ) 9 g, Gan Cao ( Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma ) 6 g, Huo Xiang ( Pogostemonis Herba ) 10 g (in later), Hou Po ( Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex ) 10 g, Cang Zhu ( Atractylodis Rhizoma ) 15 g, Cao Guo ( Tsaoko Fructus ) 10 g, Fa Ban Xia ( Pinelliae Rhizoma Preparatum ) 9 g, Fu Ling ( Poria ) 15 g, Sheng Da Huang (raw Rhei Radix et Rhizoma ) 5 g (in later), Sheng Huang Qi (raw Astragali Radix ) 10g, Ting Li Zi ( Descurainiae Semen ) 10 g, Chi Shao ( Paeoniaeradix Rubra ) 10 g, Bai He ( Lilii Bulbus ) 30 g, Mai Dong ( Ophiopogon japonicus ) 15 g.\n\n【45】This was taken orally for 3 days, 1 dose per day, 3 times in the morning, noon, and evening.\n\n【46】The treatment plan of intravenous injection was adjusted. Based on the use of Xue Bi Jing injection continuously, treatment with Shen Mai injection 40ml matched with 0.9% sodium chloride injection 100 ml was taken once a day to replenish qi, nourish yin, and enhance the effect of supporting healthy qi in TCM.\n\n【47】On day 8 of admission, all the symptoms improved. The patient was conscious and her energy was good. The concentration of high-frequency oxygen gradually decreased to 50%, the rate of oxygen flow decreased to 20 liters per minute, and the finger oxygen could still be maintained over 95%. Although short of breath when moving, she had been able to take food by herself. The tongue was pale and dark, and the coating was yellow and thick . The auxiliary examination revealed the following: white blood cells of 6.63 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L; red blood cell of 3.70 × 10 <sup>12 </sup> /L; neutrophils percentage of 77.1%; lymphocytes percentage of 14.4%; neutrophil absolute value: 5.12×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L; lymphocyte absolute value: 0.96 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L; D-dimer: 26.91 μ g/ml; total protein of 69.8 g/L; albumin of 29.0 g/L; glucose of 6.3; creatine kinase isoenzyme of 2U/L; lactate dehydrogenase of 314 U/L; kalium of 3.9 mmol/L; Na of 140 mmol/L; chlorine of 103 mmol/L; C-reactive protein of 43.1 mg/L.\n\n【48】删除3：<u>Figure 2-5-5. The tongue manifestation on 02/17.</u>\n\n【49】Note : The tongue was pale and dark, and the coating was yellow and thick.\n\n【50】The treatment was modified as follows: 1. The patient was no longer in a critical condition on this day and was changed to inhale oxygen through the mask. 2. Due to the improvements of the disease, treatment with human γ-globulin was discontinued. 3. After treatment, the qi and yin of the patient could be nourished, but it promoted dampness and heat at the same time. The prescription was adjusted to Hua Shi Bai Du Fang. The formula was as follows:\n\n【51】Sheng Ma Huang (raw Ephedrae Herba ) 6 g, Xing Ren ( Armeniacae Semen Amarum ) 9 g, Sheng Shi Gao (raw Gypsum Fibrosum ) 15 g, Gan Cao ( Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma ) 3 g, Huo Xiang ( Pogostemonis Herba ) 10 g, Hou Po ( Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex ) 10 g, Cang Zhu ( Atractylodis Rhizoma ) 15 g, Cao Guo ( Tsaoko Fructus ) 10 g, Fa Ban Xia ( Pinelliae Rhizoma Preparatum ) 9 g, Fu Ling ( Poria ) 15 g, Sheng Da Huang (raw Rhei Radix et Rhizoma ) 5 g, Sheng Huang Qi (raw Astragali Radix ) 10 g, Ting Li Zi ( Descurainiae Semen ) 10 g, Chi Shao ( Paeoniaeradix Rubra ) 10 g.\n\n【52】It was orally taken for 3 days, 1 dose per day, 3 times in the morning, noon, and evening.\n\n【53】On day 11 of admission, the patient was conscious and her energy was good. She could move by herself near her bed. The tongue was dark and slightly purple and the coating was yellow and slightly dry . Mask oxygen was 4 liters per minute, oxygen saturation was 96%, and oxygen saturation was 92% without oxygen inhalation. Heart rate was 78 beats per minute and the blood pressure was 126/67 mmHg. Examination revealed the following: White blood cells of 5.80 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L; hemoglobin concentration of 102 g/L; platelet of 192 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L; neutrophil absolute value of 4.22 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L; albumin of 30.6 g/L; uric acid of 374 μ mol/L; glucose of 6.2; C-reactive protein of 30.7 mg/L; amyloid A of 33.26 mg/L; D-dimer of 10.73 μ g/ml.\n\n【54】删除3：<u>Figure 2-5-6. The tongue manifestation on 02/19.</u>\n\n【55】Note : The tongue was dark and slightly purple and the coating was yellow and slightly dry.\n\n【56】Judging from the tongue manifestation, the patient’s internal heat had subsided. Due to the long course of this disease and old age, the patient had the symptoms of blood stasis and yin injury. Treatments with the Hua Shi Bai Du Granule orally, Xue Bi Jing injection, and Shen Mai injection intravenously were given continuously with no other special treatments.\n\n【57】On 02/20, the viral nucleic acid test (throat swab) was positive. The oxygen saturation was 92% without oxygen inhalation. On this day, the clinical study of Remdesivir had completed the observation course. On 02/21, re-examination of viral nucleic acid test (throat swab) was still positive. The oxygen saturation was 93–94% without oxygen inhalation. No special treatment was given.\n\n【58】The patient was conscious and her energy was good. She could move around by the bed. The patient complained of impatience, had a normal diet, and partial dry stools. The tongue was deep red and the coating was yellow and thick . The oxygen saturation without oxygen inhalation in the resting state was approximately 94%, and the oxygen saturation was 96% when receiving oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. Heart rate was 96 beats per minute.\n\n【59】删除3：<u>Figure 2-5-7. The tongue manifestation on 02/23.</u>\n\n【60】Note : The tongue was deep red and the coating was yellow and thick.\n\n【61】Examination revealed the following: White blood cells 4.89 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L; red blood cells 3.24 × 10 <sup>12 </sup> /L; hemoglobin 97 g/L; neutrophil percentage 59.5%; lymphocytes percentage 26.3%; neutrophils absolute value 2.92 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L; lymphocyte absolute value 1.28 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L; monocyte absolute value 0.35 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L; erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 25 mm per hour. The chest CT revealed severe infectious lesions on both the lungs and viral pneumonia, which were significantly absorbed and improved compared with the day the patient was admitted to the hospital; the heart shadow was enlarged and full, and the aorta and coronary arteries were calcified; the lymph nodes in the mediastinum were increased and enlarged; the scan showed the liver’s low-density shadows and gallstones; and the scan showed the low-density foci in the left lobe of the thyroid gland . The new Coronavirus nucleic acid test was negative.\n\n【62】删除3：<u>Figure 2-5-8. Chest CT result on 02/23.</u>\n\n【63】Note : Inflammation of both lungs was more clearly absorbed than before, leaving a stripe shadow.\n\n【64】The coating was yellow and thick again, suggesting that the residual heat had not been cleared. When the Healthy Qi was insufficient, the Evil Qi would be flourishing. Together with old age, the disease could easily recur. According to the tongue manifestation, the prescription was adjusted once again. Based on the Hua Shi Bai Du Fang, the addition and subtraction of Ascending and Descending Powder were done. The Ascending and Descending Powder mainly treated febrile disease with San Jiao of great heat in the exterior and interior, permeating pathogenic heat inside and outside, blocking the movement of qi, with lucid yang failing to rise and turbid yin failing to drop. It is composed of Bai Jiang Can (white Bombyx Batryticatus ), Quan Chan Tui ( Cicadae periostracum ), Chuan Da Huang (Sichuan Rhei Radix et Rhizoma ), and Guang Jiang Huang ( Curcumae Longae Rhizoma ), supplemented by Chinese herbs for replenishing qi and nourishing yin to assist Healthy Qi. The formula was as follows:\n\n【65】Sheng Ma Huang (raw Ephedrae Herba ) 6 g, Xing Ren ( Armeniacae Semen Amarum ) 9 g, Sheng Shi Gao (raw Gypsum Fibrosum ) 15 g, Gan Cao ( Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma ) 3 g, Huo Xiang ( Pogostemonis Herba ) 10 g, Hou Po ( Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex ) 10 g, Cang Zhu ( Atractylodis Rhizoma ) 15 g, Cao Guo ( Tsaoko Fructus) 10 g, Fa Ban Xia ( Pinelliae Rhizoma Preparatum ) 9 g, Fu Ling ( Poria ) 15 g, Sheng Da Huang (raw Rhei Radix et Rhizoma ) 5 g, Sheng Huang Qi (raw Astragali Radix ) 15 g, Ting Li Zi ( Descurainiae Semen ) 10 g, Chi Shao ( Paeoniaeradix Rubra ) 10 g, Jiang Huang ( Curcumae Longae Rhizoma ) 6 g, Jiang Can ( Bombyx Batryticatus ) 15 g, Chan Yi ( Cicadaeperiostracum ) 10 g, Lu Gen ( Phragmitis Rhizoma ) 20 g.\n\n【66】It was orally taken for 3 days, granule, 1 dose per day, 3 times in the morning, noon, and evening.\n\n【67】The patient was conscious and her energy was good. She could move around by herself with slight fatigue. And, the activity endurance was significantly enhanced compared with before. She had no cough, no chest pain, had a normal diet, and partial dry stools. The tongue was deep red and the coating was thin unevenly . The pulse manifestation was stringy and slippery. The oxygen saturation without oxygen inhalation in the resting state was approximately 95%, and the heart rate was 95 beats per minute. The new Coronavirus nucleic acid test was negative. The nucleic acid test was negative consecutively and the body temperature was normal steadily. CT of the lungs was significantly better than before. Shen Mai injection was discontinued and she was to be approved for discharge the next day. The patient continued to take the abovementioned Chinese medicine for one week after discharge. She was followed up by telephone.\n\n【68】删除3：<u>Figure 2-5-9. The tongue manifestation on 02/26.</u>\n\n【69】Note : The tongue was deep red and the coating was unevenly thin.\n\n【70】### Evaluation of Effectiveness\n\n【71】1\\. Changes in main symptoms: This was an elderly patient in critical and severe conditions. She had low oxygen without oxygen inhalation, dyspnea and tachypnea, shortness of breath, and fatigue obviously. After treatment, the abovementioned symptoms had been significantly relieved, and the patient could take care of herself. The cough and expectoration of the patient were not obvious. Stools were sometimes dry, but sometimes thin. After admission, it was mainly dry stools. The stools were significantly improved through dredging the viscera and purging heat, and then the appetite was also improved.\n\n【72】2\\. Changes in finger oxygen saturation: After admission, the patient was unable to deoxygenate. The oxygen saturation without oxygen inhalation in the resting state was approximately 75%, and the oxygen in the high-frequency oxygen inhalation state was barely maintained at about 95%. After treatment, the patient’s oxygenation saturation without oxygen inhalation could reach 95% before discharge .\n\n【73】删除3：<u>Figure 2-5-10. Changes in finger oxygen saturation.</u>\n\n【74】3\\. Change in inflammatory cytokines, as shown in Table 2-5-1 .\n\n【75】4\\. Changes in the chest CT: On admission, the patient had diffuse lesions in both the lungs, which presented as “white lungs”. More than half of the lung fields had ground-glass shadow and consolidation shadows. After treatment with integrated traditional Chinese medicine and western medicine, the conditions of both the lungs were significantly improved and presented consolidation and striped shadow in the later stage .\n\n【76】### Patient’s Condition at Discharge\n\n【77】The body temperature was normal consecutively, oxygen saturation without oxygen inhalation was 95%, and nucleic acid was negative for two times consecutively. The inflammatory indexes returned to normal. The inflammation of both the lungs was obviously absorbed. The patient was allowed to be discharged from the hospital under the improved condition. After discharge from the hospital, the patient took the above prescriptions of TCM and was followed up by telephone.\n\n【78】Table 2-5-1. Change in inflammatory cytokines.\n\n【79】### Case Analysis\n\n【80】This is a case treated by the combination of traditional Chinese and Western medicine, which converts critical and severe pneumonia to common pneumonia.\n\n【81】通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> The patient was elderly and in the critical and severe condition. On admission, the patient had oxygen saturation without oxygen inhalation of 75%, general fatigue, and obvious breathlessness. The mask oxygen saturation was approximately 92%, and the prognosis was extremely dangerous. However, after treatment with integrated traditional Chinese and conventional medicine, the course of the disease was successfully cut off and the crisis was averted.\n\n【82】通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> The choice of oxygen therapy: The patient with COVID-19 was mainly a type I respiratory failure and had poor oxygenation. Oxygen therapy is the basis therapeutic treatment. Based on finger oxygen saturation of 95%, the oxygen concentration and oxygen flow rate should be as low as possible to prepare for future deoxidation. The patient was receiving oxygen through high-frequency humidification at the oxygen concentration of 100%, the flow rate of 50 liters per minute, and the oxygen saturation of approximately 96%. As the patient improved continuously, the oxygen concentration and oxygen flow rate were down-regulated constantly until being replaced by a mask, then replaced by a nasal catheter, and then deoxygenated.\n\n【83】通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> Treatment with TCM was not abolished after she was enrolled in the Remdesivir research for two reasons: one was that the clinical efficacy of Remdesivir was not unknown; the other was that the allocation was concealed. Therefore, everything started from the patient’s condition and continued to combine with TCM.\n\n【84】通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> The importance of nursing work: The patient was elderly and in the critical and severe condition. When deoxygenated, she was short of breath and unable to eat by herself. The patient was fed, turned over, and slapped on the back with the assistance of the nursing staff in our hospital. Due to the previous operation of double knee arthroplasty, the patient could not squat and go to the toilet by herself; thereby, nursing staff assisted her to change diapers. With the guarantee of basic living, the general nutritional status of the patient had been improved and her resistance had been restored, which were also important factors in rescuing her from death.\n\n【85】通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> Although the patient was in the critical and severe condition, except for Remdesivir, we had given gamma globulin to improve the patient’s immunity and not used antibiotics or hormones. The Chinese medicine Xue Bi Jing injection had the effects of clearing away heat, promoting blood circulation, and detoxifying, which was proved to be safe and effective. At the same time, considering the patient’s advanced age and lack of sufficient Healthy Qi, Shen Mai injection should be used in combination to support the Healthy Qi during the treatment process.\n\n【86】通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u> According to the symptoms and pulse and tongue coating manifestations of the patient in different periods, although the Hua Shi Bai Du Fang was applied throughout, there were also adjustments made according to the changes in the disease. This fully embodies the regularity and flexibility of the combination of disease and syndrome in traditional Chinese medicine.\n\n【87】通用删除7(英):<u>(7)</u> Except for the improvement of symptoms and the promotion of oxygen saturation, CT of the lungs revealed that the inflammation was absorbed in an extremely obvious manner. And, the inflammatory indicators had a significant descent after treatment. It should be said that after treatment with integrated traditional Chinese medicine and western medicine, the patient was finally safe.\n\n【88】(Hao Li, Guoju Dong, Bing Wang, Tingting Zhang)", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【88】(Hao Li, Guoju Dong, Bing Wang, Tingting Zhang)", "content": "【0】Case 5\n======\n\n【1】Integrated Traditional Chinese Medicine and Western Medicine Treatment of an Elderly Patient with Critical COVID-19\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【2】### General Information\n\n【3】Sex: female\n\n【4】Age: 82 years old\n删除20：<u>Hospitalization number: 0000XXX903\n\n【5】Time of admission: 02/09/2020 20:43\n\n【6】</u>Time of discharge: 02/27/2020\n\n【7】Days of hospitalization: 18 days\n\n【8】### Prior to Admission\n\n【9】The patient was admitted to the hospital with the chief complaint of “fatigue and shortness of breath for 10 days”. Since 01/30/2020, the patient has no obvious causes of fatigue, shortness of breath, pain in the joints of the body (presumably the patient should have a fever at that time), no cough, no chest tightness, poor appetite, and loose stools 1–2 times/day. Treatment with anti-infectives for upper airway infection was given continuously for 5 days (the specific treatment plan was unknown) in the local community hospital, and the condition of the disease had been not relieved. Then, the patient visited the Union Hospital affiliated to Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology on 02/06. The chest CT revealed viral pneumonia, and the laboratory examination showed hypersensitive C-reactive protein (CRP) of 75.47 mg/L, white blood cells of 4.68 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, neutrophils absolute value of 3.74 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, lymphocytes absolute value of 0.79 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, neutrophil percentage of 80%, and lymphocyte percentage of 16.9%. The new coronavirus nucleic acid throat swab was positive. Therefore, this disease was considered to be COVID-19. The patient isolated at home, took oral medicine (specific drug unknown) and waited for admission. During the period of isolation at home, the conditions of the patient worsened progressively, and she appeared to have mental malaise, wheezing, dyspnea, shortness of breath, and fatigue. The patient was transferred to our hospital on 02/09/2020 20:43 and diagnosed with “viral pneumonia”.\n\n【10】Past history: She denied history of chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and coronary heart disease previously. She had no history of surgical trauma, no history of contact with the South China seafood market, and no history of family members suffering from pneumonia recently. She denied history of drug allergies.\n\n【11】### Patient’s Condition on Admission\n\n【12】From the onset of this disease, the patient suffered from low energy, fatigue, dyspnea and tachypnea, shortness of breath, dryness of the mouth, mental malaise, poor appetite, and poor sleep. She had dry stools in the recent 2 days and no discharge. Her body weight decreased.\n\n【13】The tongue was pale and dark, and the coating was yellow and thick . The pulse manifestation was deep, thready, and rapid.\n\n【14】The physical examination revealed a body temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 104 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and blood pressure of 168/74 mm Hg.\n\n【15】The patient was of clear mind, had low energy, oxygen saturation of 96% without oxygen inhalation, no drowsiness, soft neck, cyanotic lips, pharyngeal hyperemia, bilateral tonsils with no obvious enlargement, no purulent secretions, and a soft abdomen. The liver and spleen were not touched under the ribs. The bowel sounds were present normally. The limbs moved freely, and were cold.\n\n【16】删除3：<u>Figure 2-5-1.

On 02/10, during the morning ward rounds, the patient had low energy, shortness of breath while moving, and oxygen saturation of 73% without oxygen inhalation and 90% when receiving oxygen through a face mask, which suggested a critical condition. ECG monitoring was done, the heart rate was 100 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 170/70 mmHg. The tongue was pale and dark. The coating was yellow, thick, and greasy.\n\n【22】The coating was yellow, thick, and greasy, mainly in the middle and the root of tongue 通用删除1(英):<u>(shown in Figure 2-5-2 )</u>. The pulse manifestation was deep, thready, and rapid. Treatment with high-frequency humidified oxygen inhalation was given immediately (oxygen concentration of 100%, oxygen flow of 50 liters per minute), and the finger oxygen saturation was maintained in the range of 95–97%. COVID-19 is mainly a type I respiratory failure, and the oxygenation capacity of both the lungs is reduced. Thereby, treatment with oxygen therapy to maintain adequate oxygenation is the most basic and key therapy for COVID-19. The choice of oxygen therapy starts from the nasal catheter, of which the maximum flow rate is approximately 10 liters per minute, and the mask inhalation is also the same. If the nasal catheter and mask cannot maintain the basic finger oxygen saturation above 95%, treatment with high-frequency humidification oxygen should be given as soon as possible. If this therapy could maintain the basic finger oxygen saturation, treatment with endotracheal intubation is not recommended actively. Because endotracheal intubation needs to open the lungs and respiratory tract, which means an increased risk of infection, critical and severe patients with endotracheal intubation have a poor prognosis.\n\n【23】删除3：<u>Figure 2-5-2. The tongue manifestation on 02/10.</u>\n\n【24】Note : The tongue was pale and dark. The coating was yellow, thick, and greasy, mainly in the middle and the root of tongue.\n\n【25】Auxiliary examination on 02/10 revealed serum ferritin of 1038.95 ng/ml; white blood cells of 3.99 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L; red blood cells of 4.27 × 10 <sup>12 </sup> /L; neutrophil percentage of 76.4%; lymphocyte percentage of 16.5%; neutrophil absolute value of 3.05 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L; and lymphocyte absolute value of 0.66 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L. The results of 39 biochemical tests revealed alanine aminotransferase of 22 U/L; aspartate aminotransferase of 46 U/L; total protein of 60.8 g/L; albumin of 27.8 g/L; lactate dehydrogenase of 508 U/L; kalium of 4.2 mmol/L; chlorine of 111 mmol/L; amylase of 148 U/L; lipase of 336.0U/L; lipoprotein (a) of 313.2 mg/L; amyloid A of 183.8 mg/L; hypersensitive CRP of 92.4 mg/L; D-dimer of 24.93 ug/ml.

Chest CT result on 02/10.</u>\n\n【27】Note : Large consolidation shadows in both lungs, presentation of severe pneumonia.\n\n【28】The chest CT on 02/10  revealed severe infectious lesions on both the lungs and viral pneumonia; calcification of aorta and coronary arteries; increased and enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum; and the gallbladder scan showed high-density shadows and gallstones.\n\n【29】Combined with the patient’s symptoms, vital signs, and auxiliary examination, the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19, and with the accompanying Type I respiratory failure, the patient met the diagnostic criteria of critical and severe type.\n\n【30】### Western Medicine Treatment Strategies\n\n【31】通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> The levels of white blood cell and neutrophils were not high, and treatments with antibiotics and anti-infectives were not given temporarily. Fluid infusion was given for 5 days before admission, and oral medicine was also taken. Although the patient did not know the specific drugs, it was speculated that it was more likely to be antibiotics.\n\n【32】通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> Treatment with gamma globulin 10 g was given every day to enhance immunity.\n\n【33】通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> In order to prevent stress ulcer, treatment with pantoprazole 40 mg was given every day to protect gastric mucosa.\n\n【34】通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> Although the history of hypertension was denied, blood pressure had been high since admission. Treatment with nifedipine sustained release tablets 30 mg orally once a day was administrated to control blood pressure.\n\n【35】### TCM Treatment Strategies\n\n【36】In this case, the syndrome differentiation of TCM was damp-heat, mainly heat. Although the patient had no fever, the symptoms including dry lips, a yellow, thick and greasy coating of the tongue, and less fluid indicated that the impairment of fluid was caused by heat. In the treatment, 50 ml of Xue Bi Jing injection matched with 100 ml of saline was given by means of intravenous infusion twice a day to remove blood stasis and toxin. Xue Bi Jing injection is mainly made from Hong Hua ( Carthami Flos ), Chi Shao ( Paeoniaeradix Rubra ), Chuan Xiong ( Chuanxiong Rhizoma ), Dan Shen ( Salviae miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma ), and Dang Gui ( Angelicae Sinensis Radix ), which is able to remove blood stasis and toxin. Modern pharmacological research revealed that Xue Bi Jing injection had the pharmacological effects of regulating inflammatory and coagulating responses. Therefore, it may help to relieve the systemic inflammation induced by infection. The reasons for using Xue Bi Jing injection were as follows: First, the patient was diagnosed with severe pneumonia, with an abnormally high inflammatory profile, such as serum ferritin over 1,000 ng/ml (according to the clinical observation, this index is positively correlated with the severity of the disease, and the prognosis is relatively poor when serum ferritin is more than 1,000 ng/ml.), and the level of C-reactive protein was also high, which were consistent with the systemic inflammatory response. Second, injury of fluid due to excessive heat and homogeny of fluid and blood inevitably affected circulation. So, the patient had dark and dry lips and a dull tongue, which were the manifestations that yin and blood could not nourish the body, thus requiring approaches to promote circulation and remove blood stasis. Third, the hands and feet of the patient were cold, which was also a manifestation of local microcirculation disorders. Treatment with the prescription of Hua Shi Bai Du Granule orally was given. This was a patient with the type of critical and severe COVID-19 and retention of damp-heat in the interior. Hua Shi Bai Du Granule could be used directly. The prescription Hua Shi Bai Du Fang unites the strategies from several classic formulas. It was put forward by the practitioners in the first national Chinese medicine medical teams when they provided medical service in the Jinyintan Hospital and Dongxihu Square Cabin Hospital. By “rescuing while concluding”, they gradually learned from practicing and came up with this new formula. Basic research results showed that the prescription could reduce the lung viral load by 30%, while relieving inflammatory response and regulating immune system. Besides, it can clear and diffuse lung-heat, eliminate dampness, and expel poison in the clinical application. The formula was as follows:\n\n【37】Sheng Shi Gao (raw Gypsum Fibrosum ) 30 g, Sheng Ma Huang (raw Ephedrae Herba ) 6 g, Xing Ren ( Armeniacae Semen Amarum ) 9 g, Gan Cao ( Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma ) 6 g, Huo Xiang ( Pogostemonis Herba ) 10 g (in later), Hou Po ( Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex ) 10 g, Cang Zhu ( Atractylodis Rhizoma ) 15 g, Cao Guo ( Tsaoko Fructus ) 10 g, Fa Ban Xia ( Pinelliae Rhizoma Preparatum ) 9 g, Fu Ling ( Poria ) 15 g, Sheng Da Huang (raw Rhei Radix et Rhizoma ) 5 g (in later), Sheng Huang Qi (raw Astragali Radix ) 10 g, Ting Li Zi ( Descurainiae Semen ) 10 g, Chi Shao ( Paeoniaeradix Rubra ) 10 g.\n\n【38】This was a critical and severe patient. In order to increase the efficacy of the drug and cut off the course of the disease, the above prescription was given orally for 3 consecutive days, 3 times a day, 1 dose per day.\n\n【39】On day 4 of admission, the patient was conscious, had low energy, normal body temperature, and defecated the previous day. The patient complained of shortness of breath after activities, which was better than that on admission. Food was taken with the help of paramedics (The time without oxygen inhalation could not be too long). There was no abdominal pain and no diarrhea. SpO <sub>2 </sub> was 96% (high flow oxygen inhalation 50 liters per minute, oxygen concentration 100%). Physical examination revealed that the heart rate was 98 beats per minute and the blood pressure 140/80mmHg. The tongue was light red with little fluid, and the coating was thin, yellow, and slightly dry . The pulse manifestation was deep and thready.\n\n【40】删除3：<u>Figure 2-5-4. The tongue manifestation on 02/13.</u>\n\n【41】Note : The tongue was light red with little fluid, and the coating was thin, yellow, and slightly dry.\n\n【42】The patient was enrolled in a clinical study on Remdesivir on that day. Because it was a double-blind study, we had no idea which group she was allocated. We continued sparing no efforts in saving her life with our initial treating strategies.\n\n【43】The coating revealed that the heat receded and yin and fluid were still insufficient. In this situation, the Evil Qi was still flourishing and the Healthy Qi was deficient. Based on Hua Shi Bai Du Fang, Chinese herbs of tonifying qi and nourishing yin were added slightly. Bai He ( Lilii Bulbus ) replenishes qi and nourishes yin, Mai Dong ( Ophiopogon japonicus ) nourishes yin and clears the heart. The above Chinese herbs could be used together to achieve the effects of detoxification, replenishing qi, nourishing yin, strengthening spleen, and removing dampness. The formula was as follows:\n\n【44】Sheng Shi Gao (raw Gypsum Fibrosum ) 30 g, Sheng Ma Huang (raw Ephedrae Herba ) 6 g, Xing Ren ( Armeniacae Semen Amarum ) 9 g, Gan Cao ( Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma ) 6 g, Huo Xiang ( Pogostemonis Herba ) 10 g (in later), Hou Po ( Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex ) 10 g, Cang Zhu ( Atractylodis Rhizoma ) 15 g, Cao Guo ( Tsaoko Fructus ) 10 g, Fa Ban Xia ( Pinelliae Rhizoma Preparatum ) 9 g, Fu Ling ( Poria ) 15 g, Sheng Da Huang (raw Rhei Radix et Rhizoma ) 5 g (in later), Sheng Huang Qi (raw Astragali Radix ) 10g, Ting Li Zi ( Descurainiae Semen ) 10 g, Chi Shao ( Paeoniaeradix Rubra ) 10 g, Bai He ( Lilii Bulbus ) 30 g, Mai Dong ( Ophiopogon japonicus ) 15 g.\n\n【45】This was taken orally for 3 days, 1 dose per day, 3 times in the morning, noon, and evening.\n\n【46】The treatment plan of intravenous injection was adjusted. Based on the use of Xue Bi Jing injection continuously, treatment with Shen Mai injection 40ml matched with 0.9% sodium chloride injection 100 ml was taken once a day to replenish qi, nourish yin, and enhance the effect of supporting healthy qi in TCM.\n\n【47】On day 8 of admission, all the symptoms improved. The patient was conscious and her energy was good. The concentration of high-frequency oxygen gradually decreased to 50%, the rate of oxygen flow decreased to 20 liters per minute, and the finger oxygen could still be maintained over 95%. Although short of breath when moving, she had been able to take food by herself. The tongue was pale and dark, and the coating was yellow and thick . The auxiliary examination revealed the following: white blood cells of 6.63 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L; red blood cell of 3.70 × 10 <sup>12 </sup> /L; neutrophils percentage of 77.1%; lymphocytes percentage of 14.4%; neutrophil absolute value: 5.12×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L; lymphocyte absolute value: 0.96 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L; D-dimer: 26.91 μ g/ml; total protein of 69.8 g/L; albumin of 29.0 g/L; glucose of 6.3; creatine kinase isoenzyme of 2U/L; lactate dehydrogenase of 314 U/L; kalium of 3.9 mmol/L; Na of 140 mmol/L; chlorine of 103 mmol/L; C-reactive protein of 43.1 mg/L.\n\n【48】删除3：<u>Figure 2-5-5. The tongue manifestation on 02/17.</u>\n\n【49】Note : The tongue was pale and dark, and the coating was yellow and thick.\n\n【50】The treatment was modified as follows: 1. The patient was no longer in a critical condition on this day and was changed to inhale oxygen through the mask. 2. Due to the improvements of the disease, treatment with human γ-globulin was discontinued. 3. After treatment, the qi and yin of the patient could be nourished, but it promoted dampness and heat at the same time. The prescription was adjusted to Hua Shi Bai Du Fang. The formula was as follows:\n\n【51】Sheng Ma Huang (raw Ephedrae Herba ) 6 g, Xing Ren ( Armeniacae Semen Amarum ) 9 g, Sheng Shi Gao (raw Gypsum Fibrosum ) 15 g, Gan Cao ( Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma ) 3 g, Huo Xiang ( Pogostemonis Herba ) 10 g, Hou Po ( Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex ) 10 g, Cang Zhu ( Atractylodis Rhizoma ) 15 g, Cao Guo ( Tsaoko Fructus ) 10 g, Fa Ban Xia ( Pinelliae Rhizoma Preparatum ) 9 g, Fu Ling ( Poria ) 15 g, Sheng Da Huang (raw Rhei Radix et Rhizoma ) 5 g, Sheng Huang Qi (raw Astragali Radix ) 10 g, Ting Li Zi ( Descurainiae Semen ) 10 g, Chi Shao ( Paeoniaeradix Rubra ) 10 g.\n\n【52】It was orally taken for 3 days, 1 dose per day, 3 times in the morning, noon, and evening.\n\n【53】On day 11 of admission, the patient was conscious and her energy was good. She could move by herself near her bed. The tongue was dark and slightly purple and the coating was yellow and slightly dry . Mask oxygen was 4 liters per minute, oxygen saturation was 96%, and oxygen saturation was 92% without oxygen inhalation. Heart rate was 78 beats per minute and the blood pressure was 126/67 mmHg. Examination revealed the following: White blood cells of 5.80 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L; hemoglobin concentration of 102 g/L; platelet of 192 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L; neutrophil absolute value of 4.22 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L; albumin of 30.6 g/L; uric acid of 374 μ mol/L; glucose of 6.2; C-reactive protein of 30.7 mg/L; amyloid A of 33.26 mg/L; D-dimer of 10.73 μ g/ml.\n\n【54】删除3：<u>Figure 2-5-6. The tongue manifestation on 02/19.</u>\n\n【55】Note : The tongue was dark and slightly purple and the coating was yellow and slightly dry.\n\n【56】Judging from the tongue manifestation, the patient’s internal heat had subsided. Due to the long course of this disease and old age, the patient had the symptoms of blood stasis and yin injury. Treatments with the Hua Shi Bai Du Granule orally, Xue Bi Jing injection, and Shen Mai injection intravenously were given continuously with no other special treatments.\n\n【57】On 02/20, the viral nucleic acid test (throat swab) was positive. The oxygen saturation was 92% without oxygen inhalation. On this day, the clinical study of Remdesivir had completed the observation course. On 02/21, re-examination of viral nucleic acid test (throat swab) was still positive. The oxygen saturation was 93–94% without oxygen inhalation. No special treatment was given.\n\n【58】The patient was conscious and her energy was good. She could move around by the bed. The patient complained of impatience, had a normal diet, and partial dry stools. The tongue was deep red and the coating was yellow and thick . The oxygen saturation without oxygen inhalation in the resting state was approximately 94%, and the oxygen saturation was 96% when receiving oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. Heart rate was 96 beats per minute.\n\n【59】删除3：<u>Figure 2-5-7. The tongue manifestation on 02/23.</u>\n\n【60】Note : The tongue was deep red and the coating was yellow and thick.\n\n【61】Examination revealed the following: White blood cells 4.89 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L; red blood cells 3.24 × 10 <sup>12 </sup> /L; hemoglobin 97 g/L; neutrophil percentage 59.5%; lymphocytes percentage 26.3%; neutrophils absolute value 2.92 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L; lymphocyte absolute value 1.28 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L; monocyte absolute value 0.35 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L; erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 25 mm per hour. The chest CT revealed severe infectious lesions on both the lungs and viral pneumonia, which were significantly absorbed and improved compared with the day the patient was admitted to the hospital; the heart shadow was enlarged and full, and the aorta and coronary arteries were calcified; the lymph nodes in the mediastinum were increased and enlarged; the scan showed the liver’s low-density shadows and gallstones; and the scan showed the low-density foci in the left lobe of the thyroid gland . The new Coronavirus nucleic acid test was negative.\n\n【62】删除3：<u>Figure 2-5-8. Chest CT result on 02/23.</u>\n\n【63】Note : Inflammation of both lungs was more clearly absorbed than before, leaving a stripe shadow.\n\n【64】The coating was yellow and thick again, suggesting that the residual heat had not been cleared. When the Healthy Qi was insufficient, the Evil Qi would be flourishing. Together with old age, the disease could easily recur. According to the tongue manifestation, the prescription was adjusted once again. Based on the Hua Shi Bai Du Fang, the addition and subtraction of Ascending and Descending Powder were done. The Ascending and Descending Powder mainly treated febrile disease with San Jiao of great heat in the exterior and interior, permeating pathogenic heat inside and outside, blocking the movement of qi, with lucid yang failing to rise and turbid yin failing to drop. It is composed of Bai Jiang Can (white Bombyx Batryticatus ), Quan Chan Tui ( Cicadae periostracum ), Chuan Da Huang (Sichuan Rhei Radix et Rhizoma ), and Guang Jiang Huang ( Curcumae Longae Rhizoma ), supplemented by Chinese herbs for replenishing qi and nourishing yin to assist Healthy Qi. The formula was as follows:\n\n【65】Sheng Ma Huang (raw Ephedrae Herba ) 6 g, Xing Ren ( Armeniacae Semen Amarum ) 9 g, Sheng Shi Gao (raw Gypsum Fibrosum ) 15 g, Gan Cao ( Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma ) 3 g, Huo Xiang ( Pogostemonis Herba ) 10 g, Hou Po ( Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex ) 10 g, Cang Zhu ( Atractylodis Rhizoma ) 15 g, Cao Guo ( Tsaoko Fructus) 10 g, Fa Ban Xia ( Pinelliae Rhizoma Preparatum ) 9 g, Fu Ling ( Poria ) 15 g, Sheng Da Huang (raw Rhei Radix et Rhizoma ) 5 g, Sheng Huang Qi (raw Astragali Radix ) 15 g, Ting Li Zi ( Descurainiae Semen ) 10 g, Chi Shao ( Paeoniaeradix Rubra ) 10 g, Jiang Huang ( Curcumae Longae Rhizoma ) 6 g, Jiang Can ( Bombyx Batryticatus ) 15 g, Chan Yi ( Cicadaeperiostracum ) 10 g, Lu Gen ( Phragmitis Rhizoma ) 20 g.\n\n【66】It was orally taken for 3 days, granule, 1 dose per day, 3 times in the morning, noon, and evening.\n\n【67】The patient was conscious and her energy was good. She could move around by herself with slight fatigue. And, the activity endurance was significantly enhanced compared with before. She had no cough, no chest pain, had a normal diet, and partial dry stools. The tongue was deep red and the coating was thin unevenly . The pulse manifestation was stringy and slippery. The oxygen saturation without oxygen inhalation in the resting state was approximately 95%, and the heart rate was 95 beats per minute. The new Coronavirus nucleic acid test was negative. The nucleic acid test was negative consecutively and the body temperature was normal steadily. CT of the lungs was significantly better than before. Shen Mai injection was discontinued and she was to be approved for discharge the next day. The patient continued to take the abovementioned Chinese medicine for one week after discharge. She was followed up by telephone.\n\n【68】删除3：<u>Figure 2-5-9. The tongue manifestation on 02/26.</u>\n\n【69】Note : The tongue was deep red and the coating was unevenly thin.\n\n【70】### Evaluation of Effectiveness\n\n【71】1\\. Changes in main symptoms: This was an elderly patient in critical and severe conditions. She had low oxygen without oxygen inhalation, dyspnea and tachypnea, shortness of breath, and fatigue obviously. After treatment, the abovementioned symptoms had been significantly relieved, and the patient could take care of herself. The cough and expectoration of the patient were not obvious. Stools were sometimes dry, but sometimes thin. After admission, it was mainly dry stools. The stools were significantly improved through dredging the viscera and purging heat, and then the appetite was also improved.\n\n【72】2\\. Changes in finger oxygen saturation: After admission, the patient was unable to deoxygenate. The oxygen saturation without oxygen inhalation in the resting state was approximately 75%, and the oxygen in the high-frequency oxygen inhalation state was barely maintained at about 95%. After treatment, the patient’s oxygenation saturation without oxygen inhalation could reach 95% before discharge .\n\n【73】删除3：<u>Figure 2-5-10. Changes in finger oxygen saturation.</u>\n\n【74】3\\. Change in inflammatory cytokines, as shown in Table 2-5-1 .\n\n【75】4\\. Changes in the chest CT: On admission, the patient had diffuse lesions in both the lungs, which presented as “white lungs”. More than half of the lung fields had ground-glass shadow and consolidation shadows. After treatment with integrated traditional Chinese medicine and western medicine, the conditions of both the lungs were significantly improved and presented consolidation and striped shadow in the later stage .\n\n【76】### Patient’s Condition at Discharge\n\n【77】The body temperature was normal consecutively, oxygen saturation without oxygen inhalation was 95%, and nucleic acid was negative for two times consecutively. The inflammatory indexes returned to normal. The inflammation of both the lungs was obviously absorbed. The patient was allowed to be discharged from the hospital under the improved condition. After discharge from the hospital, the patient took the above prescriptions of TCM and was followed up by telephone.\n\n【78】Table 2-5-1. Change in inflammatory cytokines.\n\n【79】### Case Analysis\n\n【80】This is a case treated by the combination of traditional Chinese and Western medicine, which converts critical and severe pneumonia to common pneumonia.\n\n【81】通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> The patient was elderly and in the critical and severe condition. On admission, the patient had oxygen saturation without oxygen inhalation of 75%, general fatigue, and obvious breathlessness. The mask oxygen saturation was approximately 92%, and the prognosis was extremely dangerous. However, after treatment with integrated traditional Chinese and conventional medicine, the course of the disease was successfully cut off and the crisis was averted.\n\n【82】通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> The choice of oxygen therapy: The patient with COVID-19 was mainly a type I respiratory failure and had poor oxygenation. Oxygen therapy is the basis therapeutic treatment. Based on finger oxygen saturation of 95%, the oxygen concentration and oxygen flow rate should be as low as possible to prepare for future deoxidation. The patient was receiving oxygen through high-frequency humidification at the oxygen concentration of 100%, the flow rate of 50 liters per minute, and the oxygen saturation of approximately 96%. As the patient improved continuously, the oxygen concentration and oxygen flow rate were down-regulated constantly until being replaced by a mask, then replaced by a nasal catheter, and then deoxygenated.\n\n【83】通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> Treatment with TCM was not abolished after she was enrolled in the Remdesivir research for two reasons: one was that the clinical efficacy of Remdesivir was not unknown; the other was that the allocation was concealed. Therefore, everything started from the patient’s condition and continued to combine with TCM.\n\n【84】通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> The importance of nursing work: The patient was elderly and in the critical and severe condition. When deoxygenated, she was short of breath and unable to eat by herself. The patient was fed, turned over, and slapped on the back with the assistance of the nursing staff in our hospital. Due to the previous operation of double knee arthroplasty, the patient could not squat and go to the toilet by herself; thereby, nursing staff assisted her to change diapers. With the guarantee of basic living, the general nutritional status of the patient had been improved and her resistance had been restored, which were also important factors in rescuing her from death.\n\n【85】通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> Although the patient was in the critical and severe condition, except for Remdesivir, we had given gamma globulin to improve the patient’s immunity and not used antibiotics or hormones. The Chinese medicine Xue Bi Jing injection had the effects of clearing away heat, promoting blood circulation, and detoxifying, which was proved to be safe and effective. At the same time, considering the patient’s advanced age and lack of sufficient Healthy Qi, Shen Mai injection should be used in combination to support the Healthy Qi during the treatment process.\n\n【86】通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u> According to the symptoms and pulse and tongue coating manifestations of the patient in different periods, although the Hua Shi Bai Du Fang was applied throughout, there were also adjustments made according to the changes in the disease. This fully embodies the regularity and flexibility of the combination of disease and syndrome in traditional Chinese medicine.\n\n【87】通用删除7(英):<u>(7)</u> Except for the improvement of symptoms and the promotion of oxygen saturation, CT of the lungs revealed that the inflammation was absorbed in an extremely obvious manner. And, the inflammatory indicators had a significant descent after treatment. It should be said that after treatment with integrated traditional Chinese medicine and western medicine, the patient was finally safe.\n\n【88】(Hao Li, Guoju Dong, Bing Wang, Tingting Zhang)", "index": 29333, "show": true, "start": 29333, "end": 29384, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:51:08", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:52:30", "cost": 81.454}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:45:57", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:52:29", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:51:07"}

(EPA 1，2)This previously healthy 44-year-old man displayed clinical and radiographic evi-dence of a focal lung consolidation， which is consistent with a bacterial process， such as a S. pneumoniae infection. The specific causative organism is usually not definitively established， so empiric antimicrobial therapy will need to be initiated and the patient response monitored. It will also be necessary to risk stratify theHEALTH CARE-ASSOCIATED PNEUMONIA (HCAP)： Pneumonia develop-ing 48 hours after admission that was not present prior to admission. The previous concept of HCAP has since fallen out of favor due to its inability to be sensitive or specific in identifying patients who might be at risk. HCAP was previously defined as pneumonia occurring in a nonhospitalized patient with extensive health care con-tact， including one of the following： intravenous therapy， wound care， intravenous chemotherapy within the prior 30 days， those who live in a nursing home or other long-term care facility， hospitalization in an acute care hospital for 2 or more days within the prior 90 days， or attendance at a hospital or hemodialysis clinic within the prior 30 days. Recently， terminology has changed so that nursing home patients who develop pneumonia is called CAP.VENTILATOR-ASSOCIATED PNEUMONIA： Pneumonia that develops48 hours after intubation.Risk Stratification. Once the clinical diagnosis of infectious pneumonia has been made， the next step is to risk stratify the patients to determine which patients can be treated safely as outpatients with oral antibiotics and which require hospitalization. Two major risk stratification tools are currently employeds： the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) and the CURB-65. The PSI stratifies patients into five groups based on a 30-day all-cause mortality in those with radiographically proven pneumonia. This two-step processes involves first using patient demographic factors：- age> 50， medical history comorbidities， and physical examination findings—to deter-mine low-risk patients (risk class I： outpatient treatment). Patients possessing these factors progress to step 2， which utilizes objective laboratory findings to further classify patients in classes II to IV based on the number of points assigned per risk factor. Scoring is determined by taking the age (subtract 10 in women) and adding a point for each risk factor. The other stages are as follows： class II (scores <70)， class III (score 71-90)， class IV (scores 91-130)， and class V (scores > 130). Patients in classes I and II have a predicted mortality of less than 0.6% and are suit-able for outpatient treatment， while patients in class V have a 30-day mortality risk of 27%. Calculating PSI is laborious，\n\n【10】The CURB-65 serves as a simplified prognostic score using five variables：\n\n【11】Confusion (1 point)\n\n【12】Urea greater than 20 mg/dL (1 point)\n\n【13】Respiratory rate greater than 30 breaths/min (1 point)\n\n【14】Blood pressure， systolic less than 90 mm Hg (1 point)\n\n【15】Age greater than 65(1 point)\n\n【16】Patients with a score of 0 to 1 have a 30-day mortality below 3%， and they can usually be safely treated as outpatients with oral antibiotics. However， further analysis should be performed to ensure the patient's ability to take oral medications and the availability of outpatient support. Scores of 2 or greater require hospital-ization， and those of 3 or greater should be assessed for intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Patients with a score of 3 or greater have a 30-day mortality of 15% to40%. Compared to PSI， CURB-65 assigns no points to comorbid illnesses； another limitation of CURB-65 is that it assumes that the confusion is related to the acute pneumonia.Laboratory Results. Microbiologic studies， such as blood cultures and sputum Gram stain and culture， should be obtained to try to establish the etiology. Sputum samples are frequently contaminated by oral flora， limiting their value， though their diagnostic yield increases when sputum is purulent (> 25 polymorphonuclear cells and < 10 epithelial cells per low-power field). Additionally， blood cultures can fur-ther classify the etiology of pneumonia， especially since 30% to 40% of pneumococ-cal pneumonia patients are bacteremic on admission. Further serologic studies can diagnose patients who are infected with organisms not easily cultured， for example， Legionella， Mycoplasma， or C. pneumoniae.Initially， empiric treatment is based on the most common organisms given the clini-cal scenario. Macrolide antibiotics (azithromycin)， doxycycline， or antipneumococ-cal fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin or levofloxacin) are good choices for outpatient treatment of CAP caused by S. pneumoniae， M. pneumoniae， and other common bacterial organisms. Keep in mind that increasing community resistance patterns alter available antibiotic coverage. In regard to outpatient therapy duration， antibi-otics should be administered for a minimum of 5 days. Hospitalized patients with CAP usually require intravenous third-generation cephalosporin plus a macrolide(or antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone). For immunocompetent patients with hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated pneumonias， initial antibiotic coverage is broader， with more serious antibiotic coverage. Some common antimicrobials cho-sen include piperacillin-tazobactam， cefepime， levofloxacin， imipenem， or merope-nem. In addition， for patients with risk factors for MRSA infection (ie， prior intravenous antibiotic use， intravenous drug usage， recent ventilatory support)， empiric coverage for MRSA such as vancomycin or linezolid should be added. Vac-cination for influenza and pneumococcus should be considered for all who meet the criteria. Smoking cessation is also an integral part of postrecovery care.Aspiration Pneumonia. Aspiration pneumonia refers to the inflammation pro-moted by infectious agents that results from abnormal entry of fluids or secre-tions into the lower airways when defensive mechanisms of the upper airway fail. It should be noted that many healthy adults frequently aspirate small volumes of oropharyngeal secretions while sleeping (this is the primary way tha131t bacteria gainentry to the lungs)， but the material is cleared by coughing， ciliary transport， or normal immune defenses so that no clinical infection results. The affected lobe of the lung depends on the patient’'s position： In recumbent patients， the posterior segments of the upper lobes and superior segments of the lower lobes are most common.\n\n【17】Chemical Pneumonitis. Chemical pneumonitis refers to the aspiration of toxic substances (the most common being gastric acid) into the lower airway without the development of bacterial infection. The inflammation is proportional to the volume of the aspirate and the acidity of the content. The clinical presentation can go from minor dyspnea and low-grade fever to severe respiratory distress and a pul-monary infiltrate that is apparent within 4 to 6 hours and typically resolves within48 hours. Aspiration of gastric contents is most likely to occur in patients with a depressed level of consciousness， such as with anesthesia， drug overdose， intoxi-cation， or a postictal state. This process has also been described among victims of smoke inhalation. Treatment for chemical pneumonitis is usually supportive and involves positive pressure breathing， intravenous fluids， and tracheal suction.\n\n【18】Infectious pneumonia should be considered in those who fail to show clinical improvement after 48 hours of presumed chemical pneumonitis； those with sig-nificant comorbidities can be started on antibiotics initially. In contrast to chemical pneumonitis， where aspiration of vomitus may be witnessed， the aspiration of oral secretions typically is silent and should be suspected when any institutionalized patient with dysphagia presents with respiratory symptoms and pulmonary infil-trate in a dependent segment of the lung.See also Case 14 (Pulmonary Embolism)， Case 15 (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease)， Case 16 (Chronic Cough/Asthma)， Case 17 (Pleural Effusion， Parapneumonic)， and Case 18 (Hemoptysis/Lung Cancer).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "Calculating PSI is laborious，", "content": "【0】CASE 19\n\n【1】A 44-year-old man presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of shaking chills， fever，and productive cough.

(EPA 1，2)This previously healthy 44-year-old man displayed clinical and radiographic evi-dence of a focal lung consolidation， which is consistent with a bacterial process， such as a S. pneumoniae infection. The specific causative organism is usually not definitively established， so empiric antimicrobial therapy will need to be initiated and the patient response monitored. It will also be necessary to risk stratify theHEALTH CARE-ASSOCIATED PNEUMONIA (HCAP)： Pneumonia develop-ing 48 hours after admission that was not present prior to admission. The previous concept of HCAP has since fallen out of favor due to its inability to be sensitive or specific in identifying patients who might be at risk. HCAP was previously defined as pneumonia occurring in a nonhospitalized patient with extensive health care con-tact， including one of the following： intravenous therapy， wound care， intravenous chemotherapy within the prior 30 days， those who live in a nursing home or other long-term care facility， hospitalization in an acute care hospital for 2 or more days within the prior 90 days， or attendance at a hospital or hemodialysis clinic within the prior 30 days. Recently， terminology has changed so that nursing home patients who develop pneumonia is called CAP.VENTILATOR-ASSOCIATED PNEUMONIA： Pneumonia that develops48 hours after intubation.Risk Stratification. Once the clinical diagnosis of infectious pneumonia has been made， the next step is to risk stratify the patients to determine which patients can be treated safely as outpatients with oral antibiotics and which require hospitalization. Two major risk stratification tools are currently employeds： the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) and the CURB-65. The PSI stratifies patients into five groups based on a 30-day all-cause mortality in those with radiographically proven pneumonia. This two-step processes involves first using patient demographic factors：- age> 50， medical history comorbidities， and physical examination findings—to deter-mine low-risk patients (risk class I： outpatient treatment). Patients possessing these factors progress to step 2， which utilizes objective laboratory findings to further classify patients in classes II to IV based on the number of points assigned per risk factor. Scoring is determined by taking the age (subtract 10 in women) and adding a point for each risk factor. The other stages are as follows： class II (scores <70)， class III (score 71-90)， class IV (scores 91-130)， and class V (scores > 130). Patients in classes I and II have a predicted mortality of less than 0.6% and are suit-able for outpatient treatment， while patients in class V have a 30-day mortality risk of 27%. Calculating PSI is laborious，\n\n【10】The CURB-65 serves as a simplified prognostic score using five variables：\n\n【11】Confusion (1 point)\n\n【12】Urea greater than 20 mg/dL (1 point)\n\n【13】Respiratory rate greater than 30 breaths/min (1 point)\n\n【14】Blood pressure， systolic less than 90 mm Hg (1 point)\n\n【15】Age greater than 65(1 point)\n\n【16】Patients with a score of 0 to 1 have a 30-day mortality below 3%， and they can usually be safely treated as outpatients with oral antibiotics. However， further analysis should be performed to ensure the patient's ability to take oral medications and the availability of outpatient support. Scores of 2 or greater require hospital-ization， and those of 3 or greater should be assessed for intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Patients with a score of 3 or greater have a 30-day mortality of 15% to40%. Compared to PSI， CURB-65 assigns no points to comorbid illnesses； another limitation of CURB-65 is that it assumes that the confusion is related to the acute pneumonia.Laboratory Results. Microbiologic studies， such as blood cultures and sputum Gram stain and culture， should be obtained to try to establish the etiology. Sputum samples are frequently contaminated by oral flora， limiting their value， though their diagnostic yield increases when sputum is purulent (> 25 polymorphonuclear cells and < 10 epithelial cells per low-power field).

This is a man who can’t count or even read what he writes, but he has the language ability of a healthy adult and can describe in detail what it is like to experience the world with such disabling symptoms! Let’s go through his exam.\n\n【10】His visual processing was highly abnormal. Visual input is relayed from the retina via the optic nerves, tracts, and radiations to the primary visual cortex. However, wide networks of the brain are dedicated to processing these raw visual data. Although the initial or primary visual cortex receives raw visual data and can be thought of as your mind’s projection of the surrounding environment, the brain requires large secondary visual cortical regions to make sense of the information it receives. The primary visual cortex initially registers data in 1s and 0s, whereas the secondary visual cortical regions assign meaning and context to the strings of 1s and 0s—face recognition, motion, symbols, etc.\n\n【11】There are three pathways that stream out from the primary visual cortex to other parts of the brain, termed the what , where , and when pathways . The what pathway assigns meaning to the raw data and helps us recognize faces, objects, and colors. The where pathway helps us with visuospatial orientation and tells us where things are in space. The when pathway helps us process motion and order. Information travels from the occipital lobe in a tangled, constant flow to various parts of the brain, and damage to any part of this extensive circuitry can have catastrophic effects.\n\n【12】删除3：<u>Figure 22.2 Illustration of higher-order visual pathways.

He also could see primary visual data, but he could not process these raw visual data in a meaningful way; for example, he could not read. We refer to this as alexia , or the inability to read. Alexia is a type of agnosia, an inability to interpret or recognize a particular sensation, in this case a visual agnosia. This deficit is caused by damage to the what pathway. When writing is preserved, we refer to this constellation of findings as alexia without agraphia . Thus, he must have a deficit in the what pathway somewhere between the left primary visual cortex in the occipital lobe and the left parietal and temporal lobes.\n\n【15】In addition to his fascinating visual processing deficits, he could not perform basic elementary arithmetic. This is referred to as acalculia , the inability to perform math. This typically localizes to the left (dominant) angular gyrus. Music agnosia, although fascinating, is less well localized.\n\n【16】We have more than enough information to identify the localization. The lesion must be in the left (dominant) lobe affecting the what pathway as it travels from the primary visual cortex to the parietal and temporal lobes. Even though his MRI brain was normal (as noted earlier), we know there must be focal dysfunction in that region of the brain.### What is the syndromic diagnosis?\n\n【17】He presents with a syndromic diagnosis of subacute onset of a focal cortical syndrome involving the left occipital, temporal, and parietal lobes.### What is the etiologic diagnosis?\n\n【18】Given the pace of his symptoms, the differential etiologic diagnosis is limited to infectious, inflammatory, and neoplastic disorders. It would be highly unlikely for him to have a metabolic process causing a progressive focal deficit, and there is nothing in the history to suggest infection, thus making those unlikely etiologies of his symptoms. His normal MRI makes cancer (and infection causing focal deficits) unlikely, since we would expect those to be more readily apparent on imaging. Thus, we are left an inflammatory disease as the most likely etiology of his presentation.### Conclusion\n\n【19】Even though his MRI and cerebrospinal fluid were both normal, he had a markedly abnormal positron emission tomography (PET) brain that showed increased cortical metabolic activity in the left occipital, parietal, and temporal lobes . Several weeks after his spinal fluid was sent for testing, a positive result finally came back. He had anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. This is an autoimmune disorder caused by autoantibodies that bind and block the neuronal cell-surface N \\-methyl- d \\-aspartate receptor. It can present with a wide range of phenotypes from relatively mild neuropsychiatric dysfunction all the way to coma and death.

He has little to no energy. He was seen by his cardiologist 2 weeks ago and his carvedilol was decreased from 6.25 mg BID to 3.125 mg BID due to symptomatic low blood pressure readings. Mr. Johnson was told by his cardiologist that his heart function is declining and may need to consider advanced heart failure therapies.

The patient was stabilized in the emergency department and transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for observation. The patient had computed tomography (CT) scan of the head that revealed a small amount of cerebral edema but was otherwise normal. During the second day in the ICU, the nurse informs you that the patient has had a large amount of urine output in the last 24 hours. The nursing records report his urine output during the last 24 hours was 6400 cc. He has been given no diuretic medications. A urine osmolality was ordered and was found to be low. His physician remarks that the kidneys are not concentrating urine normally.\n\n【3】 What is the most likely diagnosis for the increasing dilute urine output?\n\n【4】 What is the biochemical mediator that is responsible for this disorder?\n\n【5】### ANSWERS TO CASE 46:\n\n【6】#### Diabetes Insipidus\n\n【7】Summary: A 32-year-old man with head trauma is in stable condition in the ICU with increasing dilute urine output.\n\n【8】• Diagnosis: Diabetes insipidus (DI).\n\n【9】• Biochemical mechanism: Absence of vasopressin leading to inability to retain free water.\n\n【10】### CLINICAL CORRELATION\n\n【11】Vasopressin is a hormone produced in the hypothalamus and stored in the posterior pituitary gland. It is also called antidiuretic hormone, because its presence stimulates water resorption in the distal renal tubule. Excess antidiuretic hormone can lead to “water intoxication” and hyponatremia. By contrast, lack of vasopressin leads to excess loss of free water and hypernatremia. The clinical presentation is that of a patient who is excessively thirsty, having to drink large amounts of water, and urinating large amounts of dilute urine. Head trauma is one of the most common causes, particularly if the posterior pituitary stalk is disrupted. Excessive water (psychogenic water drinking) may present similarly, but these individuals will have normal decreased urine response to water restriction, and during sleep. By contrast, patients with DI will have excessive urinary loss even with water restriction and even during the night. The treatment is administration of desmopressin acetate (DDAVP), a synthetic analogue of arginine vasopressin (AVP).\n\n【12】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【13】#### Vasopressin and Water Balance\n\n【14】### OBJECTIVES\n\n【15】1\\. Explain the role of vasopressin in the control of water metabolism.\n\n【16】2\\. Describe the role of aldosterone in regulating salt and water balance.\n\n【17】3\\. Describe the role of the hormones renin and angiotensins I, II, and III in the regulation of salt and water balance.\n\n【18】### DEFINITIONS\n\n【19】ALDOSTERONE: A mineralocorticoid hormone that is synthesized from cholesterol in the adrenal cortex and released in response to angiotensin II or III. It increases the ability of the kidney to absorb Na <sup>+ </sup> , Cl <sup>– </sup> , and water from the glomerular filtrate.\n\n【20】ANGIOTENSIN-CONVERTING ENZYME: An enzyme found primarily in the lung (as well as the vascular epithelium and other tissues) that removes 2 amino acids from angiotensin I to form angiotensin II.\n\n【21】ANGIOTENSINOGEN: α <sub>2 </sub> \\-Globulin; a 14-amino acid peptide that circulates in the plasma. It is cleaved by the protease renin to give the inactive decapeptide angiotensin I. Angiotensin converting enzyme hydrolyzes 2 amino acids from the C-terminus of angiotensin I to give the active angiotensin II, which gives rise to angiotensin III by the action of an aminopeptidase.\n\n【22】DIABETES INSIPIDUS (DI): The chronic excretion of large quantities of very pale urine of low specific gravity resulting in dehydration and extreme thirst.\n\n【23】NEUROPHYSIN: A protein that is secreted with oxytocin and vasopressin from the posterior pituitary gland. Neurophysin binds to these 2 hormones and stabilizes them.\n\n【24】RENIN: A protease that is synthesized by the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney and secreted into the bloodstream in response to conditions of hypovolemia and hyponatremia. It hydrolyzes circulating angiotensinogen to angiotensin I.\n\n【25】VASOPRESSIN: Antidiuretic hormone; a nine-amino acid peptide that is synthesized by the hypothalamus and controls resorption of water by distal tubules of the kidney. It stimulates the insertion of water channels (aquaporins) into the apical membranes of kidney tubules.\n\n【26】### DISCUSSION\n\n【27】Vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone) is a nonapeptide that controls resorption of water by distal tubules of the kidney to regulate the osmotic pressure of blood. It functions to conserve body water by reducing the output of urine, and thus it is known as an antidiuretic. Vasopressin is synthesized in the supraoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus where it is bound to a neurophysin protein carrier, packaged in granules, and delivered by intracellular transport to nerve terminals in the posterior pituitary. Vasopressin bound to neurophysin is released from the granules in response to increased extracellular osmolarity sensed by hypothalamic osmoreceptors, signaling by atrial stretch receptors or after a rise in angiotensin II levels. Its secretion is increased by dehydration or stress and decreased after alcohol consumption.\n\n【28】Vasopressin promotes increased resorption of water in the renal distal tubule by stimulating insertion of water channels or aquaporins into the apical membranes of kidney tubules. Water is resorbed across the renal epithelium into the blood leading to a decrease in plasma osmolarity and an increase in the osmolarity of urine. In DI, this process is impaired, leading to excessive urine production. In the absence of vasopressin, the kidney cannot resorb water and it flows out as urine. This condition can arise from a deficiency in vasopressin secretion from the posterior pituitary as a result of hypothalamic tumors, injury (as in the case of this patient) or infection. Alternately, the condition may result from mutations in the vasopressin receptor or aquaporin genes or other diseases impairing renal response to vasopressin. When injected in pharmacologic doses, vasopressin acts as a vasoconstrictor.\n\n【29】There are 2 major types of vasopressin receptors, V1 and V2. The V1 receptor occurs in vascular smooth muscle and is coupled via G <sub>q </sub> to activation of the phosphoinositide cascade-signaling system and generation of the second messenger inositol trisphosphate (IP <sub>3 </sub> ) and diacylglycerol. V2 receptors are found in kidney and are coupled via G <sub>s </sub> to activation of adenylate cyclase and production of the second messenger cyclic AMP.\n\n【30】The steroid hormone aldosterone, synthesized in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex, also plays an important role in maintaining blood osmolarity. It binds its receptors in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells of the distal colon and the renal nephron, followed by translocation of the hormone-receptor complex to the nucleus and activation of transcription of ion transport genes to increase Na <sup>+ </sup> reabsorption and K <sup>+ </sup> secretion. Water follows Na <sup>+ </sup> movement by osmosis. These transporters include the luminal amiloride-sensitive epithelial Na <sup>+ </sup> channel, the luminal K <sup>+ </sup> channel, the serosal Na <sup>+ </sup> , K <sup>+ </sup> \\-ATPase, the Na <sup>+ </sup> /H <sup>+ </sup> exchanger, and the Na <sup>+ </sup> /Cl <sup>– </sup> cotransporter.\n\n【31】Vasopressin and aldosterone each act on the kidney to increase fluid retention and both are in turn regulated by angiotensin II. Renin is a proteolytic enzyme that is released from the kidney in response to sympathetic neuron stimulation, renal artery hypotension, or decreased Na <sup>+ </sup> delivery to renal distal tubules. Renin cleaves circulating angiotensinogen to form the decapeptide angiotensin I. Then angiotensin-converting enzyme found primarily in lung removes 2 amino acids from angiotensin I to form the octapeptide angiotensin II. In addition to other important targets in regulating blood volume, arterial pressure and cardiac and vascular function, angiotensin II stimulates aldosterone release from the adrenal cortex and vasopressin release from the posterior pituitary. The actions of angiotensin II are mediated by plasma membrane seven-helix receptors coupled via G <sub>q </sub> signaling by the phosphoinositide pathway.\n\n【32】###", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:40:01", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:40:18", "cost": 17.612}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:45:57", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:40:16", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:39:58"}

He is experiencing tenderness over the left ankle and inability to bear weight and ambulate. He has been treating the pain with acetaminophen and ibuprofen, but the over‐the‐counter medications are no longer providing adequate pain relief. He has not had any ill contacts or recent trauma to the ankle/extremity. He has had a poor appetite and malaise over the last 3 days.Past Medical History\n--------------------\n\n【5】He is a healthy child. All immunizations are up to date including the influenza vaccine this season. No prior hospitalizations or surgeries.Family History\n--------------\n\n【6】Paternal grandfather with hypertension. Maternal grandmother with type 2 diabetes mellitus. He lives with his mother, father, and two younger brothers.Current Status\n--------------\n\n【7】On arrival to the emergency department (ED), he is slightly irritable but alert and cooperative. He is lying on the bed and is able to move all extremities, but with noticeable grimacing when asked to move his left lower extremity. He reports significant pain with external and internal rotation of his left ankle and significant tenderness to the medial portion of his distal tibia. The rest of his physical examination is unremarkable.\n\n【8】Vital signs in the ED include temperature 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate 86 bpm, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and blood pressure 118/62 mmHg. A complete blood count, C‐reactive protein (CRP), and blood culture are ordered. A plain film radiograph is obtained of the left ankle. Results of complete blood count are shown in Table 22.1 . Other results are as follows.\n\n【9】   C‐reactive protein: 67 mg/dL.\n   Blood culture: pending.\n   Left ankle plain film radiograph: normal bone mineralization; no fracture or focal bony lesion; joint spaces appear preserved; no appreciable joint effusion.Questions\n---------\n\n【10】Answer the following questions using the details provided.\n\n【11】1.

Which antibiotics should be initiated?\n4.  What is the duration of therapy?Rationale and Evidence‐based Practice Explanation\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】### Based on the data given, what is the differential diagnosis and biggest concern that would prompt further treatment and investigation?\n\n【13】Differential diagnoses for this patient includes osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, fracture, and toxic synovitis.\n\n【14】Table 22.1 Complete blood count.\n\n| White blood cell count | 13 000/mm 3 |\n| --- | --- |\n| Hemoglobin | 11 g/dL |\n| Hematocrit | 34% |\n| Platelet count | 232 000/mm 3 |\n\n【16】Toxic synovitis has a milder presentation than osteomyelitis or septic arthritis. Patients with toxic synovitis often do not have concomitant fever. The white blood cell count (WBC) and CRP are typically not elevated and patients usually retain the ability to bear weight on the affected extremity. Fracture has been excluded based on the radiograph findings. The most likely diagnoses for this child are osteomyelitis and septic arthritis. Osteomyelitis and septic arthritis may present alone or together. Both infections present with pain to the affected joint and limitation of mobility of the joint. Fever is also a common presenting symptom. The WBC and CRP are both elevated. The combination of these symptoms with the absence of significant trauma, which might point to fracture, suggest the diagnosis of osteomyelitis.\n\n【17】Osteomyelitis is caused most commonly by bacteria and presents with inflammation, subsequently causing destruction of bone. The bones of the lower limbs are affected in up to 90% of infections of children. The tibia is affected in a large percentage of osteomyelitis involving the lower limbs. Osteomyelitis can be contiguously or hematogenously spread. Contiguous spread from infected tissues or open wounds are more often polymicrobial. Hematogenously spread osteomyelitis is typically caused by a single organism.\n\n【18】The differentiation of osteomyelitis and septic arthritis from toxic synovitis is important as treatment is significantly different. Toxic synovitis is treated with rest and mild analgesics. Osteomyelitis requires aggressive treatment including antibiotics and surgical debridement. A further complication of osteomyelitis is septic arthritis, which can cause more prominent bone destruction and synovial joint space compromise. Because bone destruction and joint injury can occur quickly, treatment should begin early. Septic arthritis can be a surgical emergency because of the rapid destruction that can occur.\n\n【19】### What additional imaging would be appropriate and why?\n\n【20】Plain films of affected joints are important to obtain and they can provide information about other possible causes of symptoms, but changes in bone density that may occur with osteomyelitis can be difficult to detect in older children. Because the bones of infants are less ossified, bone density changes can be seen more easily. Plain films can show areas of swelling, changes in translucent fat planes, and in later stages may show the spread of edematous fluid. However, bony destruction is usually not detectable for 2–3 weeks after the onset of symptoms in the child with osteomyelitis.\n\n【21】MRI has become the imaging modality of choice, with a 90% sensitivity for detecting osteomyelitis. If the child can be evaluated with MRI within hours of the suspected diagnosis of osteomyelitis, it is reasonable to proceed first with this modality. MRI can accurately demonstrate subperiosteal or soft tissue collections of pus that might require surgical drainage without the use of ionizing radiation.\n\n【22】### Which antibiotics should be initiated?\n\n【23】Gram‐positive bacteria are the most common pathogens identified in osteomyelitis. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes are the most common organisms. Kingella kingae should be considered in younger children under the age of 3 years. In unimmunized patients, Haemophilus influenzae type B should also be considered. Empiric antibiotic selection should be targeted toward treatment of S. aureus and S. pyogenes in most cases. Antibiotic therapy can be tailored based on cultures, sensitivities, and local area antibiograms. If the S. aureus isolates are susceptible to methicillin, initial therapy may consist of a pencillinase‐resistant semisynthetic penicillin such as nafcillin or oxacillin. In other geographic areas where community‐acquired methicillin‐resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is common, either vancomycin or clindamycin should be included in the initial empiric therapy.\n\n【24】### What is the duration of therapy?\n\n【25】Most therapy plans start with intravenous antibiotics and continue until the patient is afebrile for more than 48 hours, is able to tolerate oral nutrition and medications, and has decreased local signs and symptoms of infection and pain. The laboratory values should also be normalized before transitioning to oral antibiotics. The WBC should be normalized and there should be a significant decrease in the CRP. After these benchmarks have been met, antibiotic therapy continues with oral medications for 4–6 weeks. Normalization of the CRP can be the marker for discontinuation of therapy.Case Progression and Resolution\n-------------------------------\n\n【26】The child was admitted to the pediatric surgical floor for additional evaluation with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), antibiotics, and surgical debridement of the left ankle. MRI of the left ankle  exhibited a heterogeneous marrow signal within the distal tibial metadiaphysis with associated subperiosteal collection measuring approximately 0.6 cm in thickness. There was extensive edema within the musculature predominantly involving the posterior deep compartment. There was a focal area in the flexor digitorum longus that demonstrated disorganized muscle fibers and a loculated collection suggestive of osteomyelitis.\n\n【27】In the operating room, a biopsy of the tissue surrounding the ankle was obtained and copious irrigation and debridement of the area was completed.\n\n【28】After hospital discharge, patients should be followed up at 1–2 week intervals to monitor continuing clinical improvement and to monitor for complications with antibiotic therapy.\n\n【29】删除3：<u>Figure 22.1 MRI of the left ankle.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 10:59:05", "endTime": "2024/09/14 10:59:37", "cost": 31.729}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:45:57", "update_time": "2024-09-13 18:59:34", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 18:59:02"}

For patients, the risk of inappropriate use of opioids includes the risks of adverse side effects, ineffective (or less than optimally effective) pain management, problems of opioid tolerance, and in some cases even opioid addiction.\n\n【2】###### Legal implications in opioid prescribing\n\n【3】Pain management providers must deal with competing problems in pain management: under treatment of pain and opioid abuse. The consequences of over-prescribing as well as under-prescribing opioids can have profound legal implications. Providers who under-prescribe can be accused of abuse, while those who over-prescribe may be subject to charges of drug trafficking.\n\n【4】A number of systems guide and sustain the practice of caring for those who are in pain.通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>11 </sup></u> The Drug Administration Agency (DEA) has strict penalties for providers prescribing without “a legitimate medical process,” who are therefore in violation of the law, and subject to civil and/or criminal penalties.通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>12 </sup></u> Responsible health-care professionals must expect that they will be held accountable for their actions. Gone are the days when public trust was so complete that healthcare professionals were subject only to a limited sphere of oversight, accompanied by informal and very private sanctions when things had not gone well.通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>13 </sup></u> In US vs. Shaygan ,通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>14 </sup></u> a Mayo Clinic trained internist was charged with 20 counts of prescribing without a legitimate medical purpose. He faced 20 years in prison for writing opioids for pain patients without aggressive treatment or monitoring. In Oregon and California, there have been two cases of physicians sued for under-treating patients. The California case resulted in an initial $1.5 million verdict against the physician (which was subsequently reduced). Another legacy of cases such as this are increasing state regulations of medical practice, such as a new California Law (AB 487) that requires every doctor in California to obtain 12 hours of CME credit in pain management and end-of-life care.\nIn the US, the Federation of State Medical Boards policies通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>16 </sup></u> include the following.\n\n【5】• Pain management is important and integral to the practice of medicine.\n\n【6】• Use of opioids may be necessary for pain relief.\n\n【7】• Use of opioids for something other than a legitimate medical purpose poses a threat to the individual and society.\n\n【8】• Physicians have a responsibility to minimize the potential for abuse and diversion.\n\n【9】• A complete patient evaluation should be performed.\n\n【10】• A written treatment plan should be given to the patient.\n\n【11】• Informed patient consent and agreement for treatment should be obtained.\n\n【12】• Periodic review of the course of treatment should take place.\n\n【13】• Physicians should show willingness to refer.\n\n【14】• Physicians should maintain complete and current medical records.\n\n【15】• Physicians may deviate from the recommended treatment steps if there is good cause.\n\n【16】##### Clinical suggestions\n\n【17】The ethical issues of coercion (“I won’t write for pain medications unless you get an injection”), financial gain (injection treatment are much higher reimbursed compared to evaluation and management), opioidophobia (physician concern regarding opioid prescribing), as well as lack of education (“If a patient goes through withdrawal, that means the patient is addicted”), has led to a state of fear as well as greed among some physicians. The patient is caught in the middle, between inappropriate opioid use (both over-prescribing, which leads to iatrogenic addiction, and under-prescribing due to refusal to prescribe) and inappropriate injection therapy (which exposes the patient to multiple expensive but often ineffective treatments, with the concomitant risks of steroid side effects, nerve injuries, potentially increased pain, and possible death). A careful review of the agenda of both the patient and physician should help to clarify the issues of self-interest versus appropriate care.\n\n【18】##### An approach to the clinical problem\n\n【19】通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Obtain an appropriate history of prior response to pain interventions.\n\n【20】Getting an accurate history of the initial response to prior injection therapy is critical to interpretating a subsequent negative response. For example, if there was no temporary response the another injection, it may indicate that the local anesthetic wasn’t in the right place (failure of accurate diagnosis or failure of accurate placement), or that the patient doesn’t respond to that local anesthetic, rather than that injection therapy has failed. A cohort of 1198 consecutive pain patients undergoing interventional procedures were interviewed regarding previous failure of temporary relief from injections or, if no prior injections, a history of difficulty getting numb at the dentist.通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>17 </sup></u> Of 250 patients with this history were skin tested with lidocaine, bupivicaine, and mepivicaine, 36% (7.5% of the total number of patients) were noted to only be numb to mepivicaine, while another 17% (3.8% of the total) were numb only to lidocaine. Many, if not most, pain procedures are done with bupivicaine, which did not work on 10% of the total population and almost 50% of the patients with a prior failed procedure. In those patients in whom bupivicaine did not work, repeating the same procedure with the appropriate local anesthetic resulted in sustained relief in more than 60% of the patients.\n\n【21】通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> Perform a meticulous physical examination.\n\n【22】A meticulous physical exam, with attention to the most common pain generators, coupled with a recognition of common patterns of pain will help guide to the diagnosis, and from that the appropriate treatment. For example, pain radiating into the groin and the testicles (less commonly described into the vaginal region in women), coupled with the description from the male patient that his testicles “are in a vise” should lead to a directed physical exam of either the ilioinguinal nerve or the iliolumbar ligament.\n\n【23】通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> Use diagnostic procedures appropriately.\n\n【24】Based on the tenderness found on exam, a directed injection (with a peripheral nerve stimulator for the ilioinguinal nerve, or under fluoroscopy for the iliolumbar ligament), using the local anesthetic that works most effectively for this patient and a small dose of deposteroid if appropriate, may establish an accurate diagnosis. Based on the response of those injections, further therapy (cryoneuroablation for the ilioinguinal nerve, radiofrequency lesioning or regenerative injection therapy for the iliolumbar ligament) provides a rational, stepwise approach to the diagnosis and treatment of the presenting pain problem.\n\n【25】#### Case resolution\n\n【26】The provider discussed with Mr. Summers the inadvisability of long-term opioid therapy in the face of treatable disease, using an analogy of appendicitis (“It would be inappropriate to just give opioids to a patient with appendicitis, though you would be willing to support the patient while you wait for his medical condition to improve or the OR staff to arrive, and you would give opioids postoperatively as the surgical site heals”). After a discussion of the proposed etiology of the pain, and the need for an accurate diagnosis (“you can’t treat what you can’t diagnose”), and skin testing to identify the most appropriate local anesthetic, the patient agreed to undergo a diagnostic and potentially therapeutic transforaminal epidural. Because of the apparent neuropathic nature of the pain, an anticonvulsant was added to the short acting opioid. Although the desired effect would be improved pain relief and therefore decreased opioid use, the patient and physician also agreed to consider a long-acting opioid such as methadone as an alternative if there was not sustained improvement in the patient’s pain with the above interventions. After a detailed informed consent regarding the risks and potential complications of opioid use, and a screening urine drug test, patient was given a prescription for 1 month of opioids and an appointment for the diagnostic injection.\n\n【27】#### Key points\n\n【28】• A primary goal of medical care is the relief of suffering and restoration of function.\n\n【29】• Pain is a subjective patient experience, and one of the greatest limitations of pain management is a lack of objective diagnostic tests that identify and quantify pain.\n\n【30】• The use of interventional procedures to diagnose and treat pain involves ethical concerns of beneficence and nonmaleficence as well as potential financial conflicts of interest for the physician.\n\n【31】• Third party payers exert additional influence on reimbursements, and the locations where pain procedures can be performed. This in turn can have affects on patient safety, as well as access to new procedures that might be deemed “investigational.”\n\n【32】• In pain management, patient vulnerability is a prominent feature of the doctor-patient relationship. Coercion, intentional or otherwise, is an ever-present possibility.\n\n【33】• Opioid prescribing is guided by both legal regulations and professional guidelines. In the US, the Federation of State Medical Boards has express policies on pain management and the obligations of physicians involved in opioid prescribing.\n\n【34】####", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:42:04", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:42:19", "cost": 15.458}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:45:57", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:42:20", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:42:04"}

Laboratory samples were taken during his examination and revealed very low blood glucose levels and elevated serum ketone levels.\n\n【2】17.1 Which of the following is the most probable cause of the elevated ketone and low glucose readings?\n\n【3】A.

Neuronal and glial metabolism is reduced\n\n【13】17.3 The patient is treated by IV thiamine and glucose solutions. Although the patient appears to be improving, ketone test strip analysis indicates an increase in urinary ketones. This is best explained by which of the following?\n\n【14】A. Conversion of β-hydroxybutyrate to acetoacetate\n\n【15】B. Decreased activity of the TCA cycle\n\n【16】C. Increased catabolism of ketogenic amino acids\n\n【17】D. Inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase\n\n【18】E. Conversion of lactate to pyruvate\n\n【19】Answer: \n17.1 B. Increased pyruvate carboxylase would favor increased gluconeogenesis. Increased protein mobilization would also favor an increase in glucose synthesis. Increasing the flux of acetyl CoA through the TCA cycle would decrease the production of ketone bodies. A lack of adequate nutrition due to nausea and vomiting as a result of excessively consuming alcohol would lead to low blood glucose. Gluconeogenesis is slowed due a high NADH/NAD <sup>+ </sup> , but fatty acids continue to be oxidized to elevate ketone body production.\n\n【20】17.2 E. None of the first 4 alternatives affects brain function. Neurons and glia require glucose as the sole source for energy production. With low blood glucose as a result of repressed gluconeogenesis, neurons and glia lack the energy that is required for function.\n\n【21】17.3 A. The increase in ketone bodies detected by ketone test strips is most likely due to conversion of β-hydroxybutyrate to acetoacetate as the NADH/NAD <sup>+ </sup> returns to normal levels. Treatment with IV glucose solutions will resolve the low concentration of blood glucose, which will decrease the need for β-oxidation of fatty acids and the production acetyl CoA, ketone bodies, and NADH. As the NADH/NAD <sup>+ </sup> decreases, the equilibrium between acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate shifts toward acetoacetate.\n\n【22】Question: 17.4 Alcohol metabolism is accomplished in various cellular compartments including the cytosol, mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum. Which reaction is least likely to inhibit the synthesis of glucose?\n\n【23】A. Ethanol → Acetaldehyde by cytosolic alcohol dehydrogenase\n\n【24】B. Ethanol → Acetaldehyde by the microsomal ethanol oxidizing system\n\n【25】C. Acetaldehyde → Acetic acid by mitochondrial acetaldehyde dehydrogenase\n\n【26】D. β-Hydroxybutyrate → Acetoacetate\nAnswer: 17.4 B. The conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase, acetaldehyde to acetic acid, and β-hydroxybutyrate to acetoacetate all produce NADH + H <sup>+ </sup> as products. Increased NADH/NAD+ inhibits those reactions that require NAD+ as an electron acceptor. Several reactions in gluconeogenesis require NAD+; therefore, these reactions would be inhibited by low NAD+. The MEOS does not produce NADH; rather, it requires NADPH as a source of reducing equivalents. Thus, oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde by the MEOS would not inhibit gluconeogenesis.\n\n【27】BIOCHEMISTRY PEARLS\n\n【28】 Poor nutrition and decreased carbohydrate consumption leads to an increase in glucagon secretion and decreased insulin secretion.\n\n【29】 The increased \\[NADH\\]/\\[NAD <sup>+ </sup> \\] from alcohol metabolism impairs gluconeogenesis by inhibiting the conversion of lactate to pyruvate and glycerol to DHAP.\n\n【30】 Compared with DKA, glucose levels in AKA are low.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:50:49", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:50:59", "cost": 9.971}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:45:57", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:50:59", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:50:49"}

He was treated with oral minocycline with some improvement  删除换行1: in his rosacea after a few months. Rosacea is an acneiform condition that causes facial  删除换行1: flushing, fixed erythema, papules, pustules and cutaneous oedema.

The patient states that he has been healthy and has no complaints except that he has been drinking a lot of water for what feels like an unquenchable thirst for the past couple of weeks. He reports that he has also been urinating excessively and is unable to sleep through the night due to his thirst and frequent urination. Urine analysis is significant only for a specific gravity of 1.002. Serum analysis is significant for an osmolality of 320 mOsm/L and a serum glucose level of 120 mg/dL. The patient is admitted to the hospital, where subcutaneous vasopressin is administered. Subsequent urine analysis revealed a specific gravity of 1.009, and serum analysis reveals an osmolality of 300 mOsm/L and a serum glucose level of 124 mg/dL. The patient is most likely to benefit from treatment with which of the following?\n\n【1】> (A) Desmopressin\n\n【2】> (B) Fluid restriction\n\n【3】> (C) Hydrochlorothiazide\n\n【4】> (D) Insulin\n\n【5】> (E) Metformin\n\n【6】 Answer: The correct answer is A . The patient has central diabetes insipidus (DI), a disorder in which the kidneys fail to concentrate urine due to a lack of ADH secretion by the posterior pituitary. Causes of central DI include head injuries, hypothalamic or pituitary tumors, and idiopathic causes. Without ADH, the principal cells of the distal tubule and collecting ducts remain impermeable to water. Nephrogenic DI is a related condition in which ADH is secreted by the posterior pituitary, but the principal cells of the kidneys do not respond to ADH because of defective ADH receptors. Causes include lithium toxicity and hypercalcemia. Both conditions are characterized by low urine specific gravity and high serum osmolality. The two are differentiated by a test dose of vasopressin, which corrects serum and urine osmolalities in central DI, but not in nephrogenic DI. Desmopressin is an ADH analog that is taken nasally to treat central DI.  \n\n【7】Answer B is incorrect . Fluid restriction is not indicated for, and is actually detrimental to, this patient because his renal system is unable to reabsorb water. In some clinical settings the fluid deprivation test may be used as part of the work-up for DI. In central DI, testing reveals low ADG levels and highly concentrated serum, yet lack of concentrated urine.  \n\n【8】Answer C is incorrect . Although it seems counterintuitive, hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic used to treat nephrogenic DI. Its exact mechanism of action is unclear. Desmopressin would have no effect on nephrogenic DI, because exogenous ADH is futile if its receptors are defective.  \n\n【9】Answer D is incorrect . Insulin is used to treat type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) and the later stages of type 2 DM. It has no indication in the treatment of DI. Although DM is part of the differential diagnosis of this patient, normal glucose levels and the positive vasopressin challenge point toward DI.  \n\n【10】Answer E is incorrect . Metformin is an oral hypoglycemic agent used to treat type 2 DM by decreasing hepatic gluconeogenesis and increasing peripheral utilization of glucose.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:16:43", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:16:51", "cost": 7.908}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:45:57", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:16:49", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:16:41"}

Chloramphenicol inhibits protein synthesis by inhibiting peptidyl transferase. This peptidyl group cannot be transferred to the aminoacyl-tRNA in the A \\-site.\n\n【14】9.2 J. Tetracyclines bind to the A \\-site of the prokaryotic ribosome and prevent aminoacyl-tRNAs from binding. Thus, protein synthesis is halted because new amino acids cannot be added to the growing protein.\n\n【15】9.3 C. Erythromycin and other macrolide antibiotics bind the 50S subunit near the P \\-site and cause conformational changes that inhibit the translocation of peptidyl tRNA from the A \\-site to the P \\-site.\n\n【16】Question: 9.4 The 6-year-old son of a migrant worker is brought to a clinic with chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, and sore throat. The examining physician notes a persistent grayish colored membrane near the tonsils. History reveals that the patient has not been immunized against diphtheria. Diphtheria toxin is potentially lethal in this unimmunized patient because it causes which of the following?\n\n【17】A. Inactivates an elongation factor required for translocation in protein synthesis\n\n【18】B. Binds to the ribosome and prevents peptide bond formation\n\n【19】C. Prevents binding of mRNA to the 60S ribosomal subunit\n\n【20】D. Inactivates an initiation factor\n\n【21】E. Inhibits the synthesis of aminoacyl-charged tRNA\n\n【22】Answer: 9.4 A. Diphtheria toxin has 2 subunits. The B subunit binds to a cell surface receptor and facilitates the entry of the A subunit into the cell. The A subunit then catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation of elongation factor 2 (EF2). Thus, EF2 is inhibited from participating in the translocation process of protein synthesis; hence, protein synthesis stops.\n\n【23】Question: 9.5 Replication of a particular DNA sequence is noted to be under inhibitory control usually.

An inducer is a small molecule that binds to and inactivates a repressor, which allows the sequence of DNA to be transcribed. An operon is a set of prokaryotic genes in close proximity that are coordinated as “all off” or “all on.” An inducer may act to “turn on” the operon. One classic example is the lac operon . When allolactose is present, it serves as an inducer, and the operon is turned on, allowing proteins to be formed that metabolize lactose.\n\n【29】BIOCHEMISTRY PEARLS\n\n【30】 The synthesis of proteins involves converting the nucleotide sequence of specific regions of DNA into mRNA ( transcription) , followed by the formation of peptide bonds in a complex set of reactions that occur on ribosomes ( translation) .\n\n【31】 Protein synthesis is divided into 3 stages: initiation, elongation, and termination.\n\n【32】 rRNA is a component of the ribosomes, the protein synthesis factories in the cell.\n\n【33】 Many antibiotics take advantage of the differences of the rRNA between eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:15:53", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:16:01", "cost": 8.296}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:45:57", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:16:01", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:15:53"}

She states that she recently broke up (for the fifth time) with her boyfriend, who disapproves of her cocaine and marijuana use. She also states that she and her ex-boyfriend fight constantly, and that she has made “hundreds” of suicide attempts and has been hospitalized many times. Physical examination reveals reddened conjunctivae, an eroded nasal septum, and numerous small, uniformly sized punched-out skin lesions on the upper and lower extremities.

Splitting is a defense mechanism associated with borderline personality disorder (BPD). Patients with BPD often engage in self-destructive behaviors such as cutting or burning themselves with cigarettes. They have extremely labile moods and unstable relationships. Splitting involves the either/or categorization of things as all good or all bad. The patient might state that the male resident is the only doctor who has ever understood her, and that all the other doctors are ignorant. Or she might view the nursing staff as wonderful and the medical staff as abominable.  \n\n【7】Answer A is incorrect. Denial involves the refusal to accept a reality that a person deems unsettling. For instance, a person may write off persistent negative job performance reviews rather than accepting that his work abilities are deficient.  \n\n【8】Answer B is incorrect. Humor is a mature defense mechanism, which involves expressing uncomfortable emotions in a comfortable way (ie, as funny): an overweight patient might make jokes about “fat people.”  \n\n【9】Answer C is incorrect. Reaction formation has been called unconscious hypocrisy. The person adopts opposite attitudes to unconscious emotions. A burnt out doctor who dislikes medicine may spend his time encouraging medical students in their professional development.  \n\n【10】Answer E is incorrect. Sublimation is a mature defense mechanism that involves the expression of uncomfortable emotions (anger) in a socially useful way, such as becoming an advocate for social justice. In reaction formation, the person unconsciously replaces the uncomfortable emotion with actions that are opposite his/her true emotion.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:38:56", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:39:00", "cost": 3.148}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:45:57", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:39:00", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:38:56"}

There are three groups main organisms that cause cutaneous fungal infections: dermatophytes (noninvasive and only grow on superficial layers of skin), yeasts (e.g. candida), and non-dermatophyte molds 删除10：<u>(Elewski et al. 1989 ; James et al. 2006 )</u>. Of note, dermatophytes do not grow on routine fungal culture media and require special temperature and medium. Potassium hydroxide (KOH) examination should be considered on scaling eruptions to look for dermatophytosis.\n\n【27】Candidiasis is an infection caused by yeast, often of the species Candida albicans. Infection may occur on this skin, in mucous membranes, or the nails. Candidiasis of the oral cavity is called thrush. Infection at the base of the nails is called paronychia.\n\n【28】Candida albicans is normal flora on human skin. Breaks in the skin allow penetration of the yeast into the skin and infection occurs, particularly if the patient has predisposing conditions: diabetes mellitus, obesity, heat, chronic debilitation, altered immune status (AIDS), chronic antibiotic use, or long-term systemic steroid therapy 删除10：<u>(Pappas 1998 )</u>. The form most commonly seen in the older population is intertriginous candidiasis , which affects moist body fold, including the inguinal, inframammary, infraabdominal, and axillary folds. The infection caused by the yeast ranges from superficial lesions to disseminated infections. Widespread, or disseminated, infection is more commonly seen in immunocompromised individuals.\n\n【29】The patient may complain of pruritus and a burning sensation on the skin where the Candidiasis infection is present. The eruption often presents as bright, ‘beefy’ red erythema and is often surrounded by pustules and papules. Remnants of pustules may appear as macules with a scaly border.\n\n【30】Treatment\n---------\n\n【31】Topical treatments with nystatin, econazole, or imidaole are is often used when small areas are affected. Some over-the-counter products (e.g. clotrimazole, naftifine, terbinafine) are commonly stocked in skilled nursing facilities and often work well to clear the infection. Systemic therapy with oral or intravenous medications may be used for widespread infections 删除10：<u>(Lesher et al. 1987 )</u>. These medications may affect prothrombin time (PT) levels in patients taking warfarin (Coumadin). Additional testing of this lab value may be ordered by the practitioner.\n\n【32】Differentials\n-------------\n\n【33】Irritation or erythema under the breasts or the axilla does not always indicate a yeast infection. Sometimes skin breakdown from moisture and mechanical shearing in the absence of infection may cause irritant intertrigo. This does not require treatment with antifungal medications, but is best treated by keeping the area clean and dry and generous application of barrier creams (e.g. zinc oxide, petrolatum).\n\n【34】Differentials: Psoriasis can cause discrete scaly red papules and plaques. The scale is typically much thicker and satellite pustules or papules are absent.\n\n【35】Tinea corporis causes scaly red plaques that can occur on the trunk and neck. However, the lesions are often annular, rather than being the confluence of many small scaly macules.\n\n【36】Cellulitis is commonly caused by gram positive bacteria and typically presents with poorly demarcated erythema, swelling, pain, and warmth of the skin. Regional lymph nodes may also be enlarged and tender.\n\n【37】Eczema is typically accompanied by erythema, skin edema, crusting of the skin, and blisters that often show signs of cracking and ooze fluid.\n\n【38】Key Points\n----------\n\n【39】   Commonly caused by moisture, especially in the intertrigionous areas\n\n【40】   May be widespread, especially in immunocompromised persons\n\n【41】   Not all redness seen in intertriginous areas is Candidiasis.

Schonberger and Stanley H. Rosenbaum\n\n【2】#### The Case\n\n【3】> A 35-year-old patient is comatose following a drowning. The treating neurologist has found the patient to be irreversibly unconscious with absent brainstem reflexes and no respiratory effort during an apnea test. Because of persistent limb movements thought to be most likely spinal in origin, the primary team elects to get a confirmatory EEG that indicates no brain activity. At the conclusion of EEG testing, the attending neurologist writes in the chart, “3/15/09 20:00. The patient is now deceased.” The next of kin decide the following morning not to donate the organs, and respiratory support is promptly removed with an accompanying chart note saying, “3/16/09: The patient has died. Time of death 0700.” Two weeks following this incident, the state medical examiner contacts the care team and inquires as to the proper time of death .\n\n【4】##### The historical development of a neurological standard of death\n\n【5】While the determination of death among many traditions has for thousands of years relied on the cessation of the pulse or respirations, twentieth-century medical care brought about both new possibilities and incentives for redefining death in terms of a neurological standard. The possibility of brain death in the presence of continued cardiovascular function emerged during the 1950s, largely as a consequence of new developments in the medical care of the critically ill. Shortly thereafter, the incentives for a new definition of brain death expanded and took on new practical urgency with the advent of deceased-donor organ transplantation.\n\n【6】Among the medical developments that led to the possibility of a new concept of brain death was the improvement in techniques of pulmonary support via mechanical ventilation during the polio epidemics of the 1940s and 1950s.通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>1 </sup></u> Other techniques of cardiovascular support soon followed, including the development of cardiopulmonary bypass in the 1950s and the formalization of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the late 1950s and early 1960s. As society was confronted with the possibility of an apparently alive body in an irreversibly brain dead patient, medicine was ripe for a neurologically based definition of death that could guide the ethical discontinuation of cardiopulmonary support in such patients. In 1959, the concept of irreversible coma was introduced by Mollaret and Goulon in France. However, it may have been the subsequent development of organ transplantation, and the accompanying increase in the practical import for determining brain death, that led 10 years later to the creation of the first widely accepted standard of brain death.\n\n【7】In 1968, 1 year after the first successful heart transplant, a well-publicized effort in the United States to reexamine the definition of death in terms of a neurological standard was conducted by a committee at Harvard Medical School.通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>2 </sup></u> This committee, lead by the chairman of Anesthesiology at Harvard Medical School, Henry Beecher, MD, published what subsequently became known as the Harvard Criteria for determination of brain death which included: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> unreceptivity and unresponsivity; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> no movements or breathing; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> no reflexes (including deep tendon reflexes). The criteria also suggested checking an electroencephalogram (EEG) when available for its “great confirmatory value.”通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>2 </sup></u> An isoelectric EEG should demonstrate no brain activity, and there should be no muscle movement. The Harvard Criteria mandated these tests be done twice separated by 24-hours. In addition, it was necessary to confirm that the patient was neither sedated nor hypothermic. While the Harvard criteria would be modified by various authorities over the subsequent four decades as described below, these guidelines represented the inaugural moment for a neurological standard of death into medical practice.\n\n【8】##### Current international neurological standards for determination of death\n\n【9】###### The whole brain death standard\n\n【10】While the concept of brain death is now well established, the specific criteria for its determination vary among different countries. The legal brain death standard that has been adopted in the majority of the United States is based on the advice of the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>3 </sup></u> which formed a model of brain death legislation in 1980 that was subsequently adopted by both the American Medical Association and the American Bar Association as well as a large majority of state legislatures. This standard requires the determination of “irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain, including the brain stem.” Similar so-called “whole brain death” standards have also been adopted in Canada, Australia, and South America, as well as most European countries with the notable exception of the United Kingdom .\n\n【11】East Asian countries have seen more recent acceptance of a neurological standard, with brain death criteria analogous to the US standards having been adopted in Japan in 1997 <sup>1 </sup> and in South Korea in 2000. A major meeting of Chinese officials to discuss the establishment of neurological standards of brain death occurred in 2008, but no English language summary of their findings was located by the present authors.\n\n【12】The determination of whole brain death, when made on clinical grounds, requires the demonstration of three things: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> an irreversible comatose state; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> the loss of brainstem reflexes; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> brainstem inactivity leading to apnea. After reversible causes of apparent coma, such as hypothermia, intoxication, severe metabolic derangement, or residual neuromuscular blockade have been ruled out or otherwise corrected, a patient meets the standard by demonstrating the absence of responses to painful stimuli including to cranial nerve territories (coma), the lack of all cranial nerve reflexes (brainstem areflexia), and the absence of respiratory efforts in the face of a hypercarbic challenge (brainstem inactivity). Of note, the whole brain death standard differs from the Harvard criteria in making no mention of spinal cord function or the total absence of muscle movements. This standard also requires no documentation of hypothalamic failure. Although hypothalamic dysfunction including diabetes insipidus is often seen in patients diagnosed as brain dead, both hypothalamic and pituitary function as well as spinal reflexes are commonly found to continue in patients who meet the current whole brain death criteria.\n\n【13】Protocols for the clinical determination of brain death vary among institutions but must generally be made by more than one doctor in one of several relevant specialties (usually some combination of neurology, neurosurgery, trauma, or anesthesiology). In some institutions, most commonly in reference to pediatric patients, clinical assessment must be repeated over various intervals of time before the declaration of death can be properly made.\n\n【14】###### Sufficiency of the clinical diagnosis of brain death versus neurophysiologic testing\n\n【15】The majority of the US as well as most European Union countries have followed the lead of the Harvard committee in specifying that the clinical diagnosis of brain death in adults is sufficient in itself for the determination of death, without the need for confirmatory neurophysiologic testing. In these jurisdictions, neurophysiologic assessment is reserved for young pediatric patients as well as for circumstances in which there is an inability to perform any of the required clinical tests of brain death or where, for whatever reason, some doubt exists about the clinical diagnosis of brain death. For example, a patient too unstable to tolerate an apnea test, may instead undergo alternative neurophysiologic testing. Exceptions to the sufficiency of the clinical standard in adults include France, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, each of which requires some type of confirmatory neurophysiologic testing even in the presence of clinical brain death.\nNeurophysiologic testing generally falls into two categories that serve either “to confirm the loss of bioelectrical activity of the brain” or to “demonstrate cerebral circulatory arrest.”通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>4 </sup></u> Confirmation of brain death via examination of bioelectrical activity can itself be conclusive via the finding of an isoelectric EEG in the absence of other causes for central neurological depression. The absence of brainstem auditory evoked potentials or somatosensory-evoked potentials can also be useful in certain circumstances. These tests have the advantage of being less susceptible than EEG to distortion by sedative drugs, but evoked potential monitoring, while suggestive, cannot in isolation conclusively determine whole brain death.\n\n【16】Neurophysiologic determinations of cerebral circulatory arrest include four-vessel cerebral angiography as well as various scintigraphic perfusion studies. Angiography demonstrating absence of blood flow to the brain is widely accepted throughout Europe and the US as a valid standard, while scintigraphic perfusion studies, which may be less sensitive markers for the absence of brain perfusion, are accepted in some United States institutions as well as in Germany and Switzerland.通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>4 </sup></u> Finally, transcranial Doppler may be used as a valid confirmatory test of brain death only in Germany but is not in itself sufficient for the diagnosis of brain death due to the possibility of an insufficient bone window for valid blood flow determinations.\n###### The brainstem death standard\n\n【17】The UK and India are unique in having a neurological standard of death that specifically focuses on brain stem dysfunction. In 2008, the UK’s Academy of Medical Royal Colleges published its “Code of Practice for the Diagnosis and Confirmation of Death.”通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>5 </sup></u> (UK) The authors reaffirm the UK’s original 1976 neurological standard of death which was based on “the irreversible cessation of brainstem function.” In India, a similar declaration was part of the Transplantation of Organs Act of 1994. The Academy of Medical Royal Colleges argues that loss of brainstem function entails both apnea as well as the loss of consciousness and therefore suffices for the determination that the “death of the individual” has occurred. For the exclusively clinical diagnosis of brain death, there is little practical difference between the UK definition and a whole brain definition of death. If neurophysiologic testing is used, however, patients with continued cortical EEG activity or cortical blood flow could still be considered dead according to the UK and Indian standards but not by the other countries considered in this review.\n\n【18】Practitioners involved in brain death determinations or engaged in the care of deceased organ donors would be well advised to familiarize themselves with their own institutional guidelines as well as the laws of their particular jurisdiction, as the nuances and procedural requirements for determination of brain death may be critical in determining the status of suspected brain dead patients. Moreover, some jurisdictions give the next-of-kin the right to deny that a neurological standard of death be used at all.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 13:46:13", "endTime": "2024/09/14 13:46:37", "cost": 23.847}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:45:57", "update_time": "2024-09-13 21:46:37", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 21:46:13"}

Woosley\n\n【2】Long School of Medicine, University of Texas Health, San Antonio, TX, USA\n\n【3】A 3‐month‐old infant is admitted with respiratory failure, traumatic brain injury, and concern for child abuse.History of Present Illness\n--------------------------\n\n【4】The patient is a 3‐month‐old male who was taken to an outside facility emergency department (ED) by his parents after he was found unresponsive in the crib. The child was transported by private vehicle approximately 15 minutes to the hospital, during which time he remained unresponsive. On arrival to the ED, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was initiated, the patient was intubated, and CPR was continued for approximately 6 minutes until return of spontaneous circulation was attained. He had a head computed tomography (CT) completed which indicated a possible right subdural hemorrhage, slit ventricles, and near complete effacement of the basal cisterns. He was transferred by helicopter to the pediatric level I trauma center for continued care.Past Medical and Surgical History\n---------------------------------\n\n【5】The patient’s medical history was unobtainable due to lack of family presence on arrival to the trauma center.Current Status\n--------------\n\n【6】On initial assessment at the trauma center, the patient has a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 3T (intubated), fixed and dilated pupils, and no cough or gag reflexes. He has a repeat head CT and a chest, abdomen and pelvic CT. Initial laboratory studies are obtained, and the patient is then transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Vital signs in PICU are as follows: temperature 33.9°C (93.0°F), heart rate 114 bpm, respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute, which was the set ventilator rate, blood pressure BP 73/41 mmHg, and oxygen saturation ( S p O <sub>2 </sub> ) 100%, with ventilator oxygen set at 100%. Laboratory studies included a complete blood count, coagulation panel, and a comprehensive metabolic profile. The results are basically within normal limits, except for an elevated glucose (182 mg/dL) and potassium (5.8 mEq/L), and carbon dioxide level of 12 mg/dL. The results of arterial blood gas analysis are shown in Table 86.1 .\n\n【7】The results of the head CT show diffuse hypoattenuation throughout the brain parenchyma with sulcal effacement and slit‐like lateral ventricles and near‐complete effacement of the basal cisterns. These findings are consistent with brain edema likely from hypoxic brain injury. No intracranial bleed was appreciated.\n\n【8】The chest and abdominal CT results show: 删除换行1:    grade I right mid pole renal laceration; 删除换行1:    displaced posterior left 10th rib fracture; 删除换行1:    non‐displaced fracture involving the medial third of the left clavicle; 删除换行1:    thin periostial reaction about the bilateral humeri seen best on the coronal reformats, which suggests healing of prior trauma that may be non‐accidental; 删除换行1:    transverse fracture through the right hallux proximal phalanx; 删除换行1:    bilateral lung consolidations, likely due to aspiration and atelectasis.Questions\n---------\n\n【9】Answer the following questions using the details provided.\n\n【10】1.  Based on the data presented, what are the differential diagnoses and what is the most likely diagnosis for this patient?\n\n【11】    Table 86.1 Arterial blood gas analysis.\n\n    | pH | 7.28 |\n    | --- | --- |\n    | P CO 2 | 28 mmHg |\n    | P a O 2 | 307 mmHg |\n    | Bicarbonate | 14 mEq/L |\n    | Base deficit | –8 |\n\n【13】2.  What are the important considerations when determining whether a brain death examination is warranted?\n3.  What are the relevant clinical findings and laboratory and imaging results, presented or missing in reported data, that help determine the possible outcomes and plans for this patient?\n\n【14】Continuation of case : The infant continued on mechanical ventilation with no sedation required. A blood gas analysis indicated hypocapnia, so the ventilator rate was decreased. Neurologic examinations remained the same, with no responses in pupillary reaction, cough or gag reflex.\n\n【15】1.  What disciplines should be included in the care of this patient?Rationale and Evidence‐based Practice Explanation\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】### Based on the data presented, what are the differential diagnoses and what is the most likely diagnosis for this patient?\n\n【17】The differential diagnoses for this patient are non‐accidental trauma to the brain, osteogenesis imperfecta, ingestion of a toxic substance, bleeding disorder, or cardiac failure leading to respiratory failure. The most likely diagnosis for this patient is traumatic brain injury with acute respiratory failure. The diagnosis of brain death is also appropriate in this case because of the apparent lack of brainstem function and reflexes.\n\n【18】This patient’s lack of brainstem reflexes is an important clinical finding that helps determine the likely outcome, along with the period of unresponsiveness and consistency of the poor neurologic examinations. Relevant imaging results in this case are the findings on the head CT. The patient’s CT performed at the outside hospital revealed a subdural hemorrhage and subsequently showed hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. Both of these injuries are common results of traumatic brain injury that can lead to brain death. The near effacement of the basal cisterns also signifies pending brain herniation. These findings are poor prognostic indicators for this patient.\n\n【19】The pathology involved with this type of brain injury is easily explained. The intracranial vault is composed of a fixed volume of brain, cerebrospinal fluid, and blood. The Monro–Kellie doctrine states that an increase of one of these fixed volumes must be offset by a decrease in another (Saceleanu et al . 2018 , p. 48). Secondary cerebral lesions such as subdural hematomas or other intracranial hemorrhages can cause cerebral edema. A small increase in cerebral edema or intracranial volume can cause a serious increase in intracranial pressure which can compromise cerebral perfusion, resulting in brain ischemia, cerebral edema, brain herniation, and death 删除10：<u>(Saceleanu et al . 2018 )</u>.\n\n【20】### What are the important considerations when determining whether a brain death examination is warranted?\n\n【21】Brain death is a clinical diagnosis and is defined as the irreversible loss of all brain functions including the brainstem. Coma, apnea, and the absence of brainstem reflexes are essential findings in brain death. A task force consisting of representatives including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Society of Critical Care Medicine, and the Child Neurology Society established guidelines for determining brain death in children initially in 1987, and these were revised in 2011 删除10：<u>(Nakagawa et al . 2011 )</u> and reaffirmed in 2015. In summary, to determine brain death in children: after hypotension, hypothermia and metabolic disturbances are treated and corrected and current medications that can interfere with neurologic examination are discontinued and cleared, two examinations including apnea testing with each examination are completed. Prerequisite conditions should be met; an etiology of the coma should be known, and potentially reversible causes of coma should be excluded.\n\n【22】   Systolic blood pressure should be normalized for age.\n   Core body temperature should be >35°C.\n   Sedative and narcotic elimination should be considered, but there is no definite recommendation for the number of half‐lives that must pass, as in the adult criteria.\n   The P a CO <sub>2 </sub> must be at least 60 mmHg and must be 20 mmHg greater than baseline for an apnea test to be considered positive.\n   Ancillary testing may be done if there is uncertainty about the results of the examintion or if medications may affect evaluation of the patient 删除10：<u>(Nelson and Lewis, 2017 )</u>.\n\n【23】The brain death examintion is a clinical investigation of the brainstem reflexes. It includes pupillary response to light; gag, cough, sucking and rooting reflexes; corneal reflexes; oculovestibular and oculocephalic reflexes; and movement of bulbar musculature including facial and oropharyngeal muscles. The pupillary response to light tests cranial nerves II and III. When the pupils are not responsive to light, it confirms that these nerves are not intact. Cranial nerves III, IV, VI, and VIII are responsible for ocular movements and are tested by performing oculovestibular testing or what is commonly called “cold caloric” testing. If no eye movement is noted after ice water is injected into each ear 5 minutes apart, this indicates a lack of response. Oculocephalic (doll’s eyes) testing is performed by briskly rotating the head horizontally and vertically and if no eye movement is noted it confirms lack of response. Corneal reflex is controlled by cranial nerves V and VII, and involves the lack of eyelid movement when the cornea is touched with a cotton swab. Cranial nerves IX and X are responsible for the cough and gag reflexes, and they are absent when a patient is brain dead 删除10：<u>(Nelson and Lewis, 2017 )</u>.\n\n【24】The apnea test is also part of the brain death examination. The main objective of the apnea test is to prove that there is absence of respiratory system reflexes in the brainstem, indicating that there is no physiologic stimulation to breathe. There must be documentation of a rise in P a CO <sub>2 </sub> of 20 mmHg above the baseline value, and the reading must be more than 60 mmHg with absence of respiratory effort during the test 删除10：<u>(Nelson and Lewis, 2017 )</u>.\n\n【25】Two examinations must be completed separated by an observation period, and must be performed by different attending physicians (although the apnea test may be performed by the same physician). The recommended observation period is 24 hours for neonates (37 weeks’ gestation to term infants 30 days of age) and 12 hours for infants and children (>30 days to 18 years) 删除10：<u>(Nakagawa et al . 2011 )</u>. There are no data available to document brain death in infants less than 37 weeks’ gestation. Teens may also fall into either pediatric or adult guidelines, based on where they are cared for. If in the PICU, the child is determined to be brain dead based on pediatric guidelines. Ancillary tests are used in addition to clinical brain death examinations; for infants and children, they include the nuclear blood flow or perfusion scan, and electroencephalogram (EEG) only. Reduction of the observation periods is acceptable using an accepted ancillary study, but when an ancillary study is used to decrease the observation interval, two examinations and two apnea tests are recommended. One examination and an apnea test should be completed before the ancillary study, and the second examination and an apnea test should be completed after the ancillary study The conditions above must be persistent when examination is repeated.\n\n【26】Missing or unclear information relevant to this patient’s current status and potential outcome is the use of any narcotic or brain‐altering medication. Sedatives, analgesics, antiepileptics, and neuromuscular blockers can all affect the neurologic examination. Knowledge of administration of any of these and other medications is imperative in order to determine whether the medication is affecting the patient’s clinical examination. The original mechanism of injury is also unknown.\n\n【27】### What are the relevant clinical findings and laboratory and imaging results, presented or missing in reported data, that help determine the possible outcomes and plans for this patient?\n\n【28】The patient’s temperature is a vital component when determining plans for this patient and must be normalized to complete the brain death testing. Hypothermia may alter the metabolism and clearance of medications that can interfere with brain death testing, and it is a known cause of depression of central nervous system functions 删除10：<u>(Nakagawa et al . 2011 )</u>. In pediatrics, a core body temperature of greater than 35°C (95°F) should be achieved when performing a brain death examination 删除10：<u>(Nelson and Lewis, 2017 )</u>.\n\n【29】Electrolyte abnormalities can alter a patient’s physical ability, and can be the cause of major organ failure, so correction of the abnormal value is imperative to optimize the patient’s outcome or contribute to the decision to declare brain death. Reversible electrolyte disturbances such as severe electrolyte imbalances, hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, severe pH disturbances, and hepatic or renal dysfunction can all lead to coma in the pediatric patient.\n\n【30】Sometimes the ancillary tests are not congruent with the clinical examination. For example, a patient with normal cranial nerve ability may have an isoelectric EEG in the setting of hypothermia or metabolic encephalopathy; another example is an EEG that shows electrical activity, but this may possibly be due to electrical artifact in an intensive care environment (pumps, ventilators) 删除10：<u>(Lewis et al . 2017 )</u>. It is important to recognize that there are limitations and potential incongruences with ancillary tests. In pediatric brain death, ancillary tests are done if there is uncertainty about brain death examination results or if medication effects interfere with evaluation of the patient 删除10：<u>(Nelson and Lewis, 2017 )</u>. They may also be utilized if components of the examination or apnea testing cannot be completed safely, or to reduce the observation period between the two examinations 删除10：<u>(Nakagawa et al . 2011 )</u>.\n\n【31】### What disciplines should be included in the care of this patient?\n\n【32】A multidisciplinary approach is important because of the mechanism of injury and the poor prognosis of this patient. The medical team, neurosurgery, trauma surgery, and pediatric critical care providers will all be involved in the care of this patient. The bedside pediatric nurses are important contributors to discussions involving the potential brain death examinations because of their proximity to the bedside and the patient’s family. Palliative care and social work are also an important resource for the patient’s family as well as with the staff’s emotional needs. Organ donation teams may also be involved, along with the palliative care team because they can help with supporting the bereaved family members if they decide to donate their child’s organs. The involvement of the palliative care team, in collaboration with the medical providers, is important as literature indicates that this aspect of care provision greatly impacts the decision for parents to agree to organ donation 删除10：<u>(Basak et al . 2018 )</u>.\n\n【33】For this particular case, the child abuse specialists should also be involved due to the unknown cause of injury and obvious non‐accidental head injury. Child life specialists can assist with grief and bereavement support, as well as provide handprints, molds, and other special gifts for the family. Pastoral services are also an important addition to the team as they can provide spiritual guidance to the family and care providers.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:23:51", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:24:17", "cost": 26.778}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:45:57", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:24:18", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:23:50"}

Failure of this vestigial structure to degenerate may lead to which of the following complications?\n\n【1】> (A) Bladder exstrophy\n\n【2】> (B) Bladder adenocarcinoma\n\n【3】> (C) Meckel diverticulum\n\n【4】> (D) Polycystic kidney disease\n\n【5】> (E) Renal agenesis\n\n【6】 Answer: The correct answer is B. The portion of the bladder that extends into the umbilical cord is the allantois, an extraembryonic cavity within the body stalk that projects onto the cloaca (the future bladder), and regresses prior to birth as the bladder descends into the pelvis. It gives rise to the urachus, which later degenerates into a fibrous structure running along the anterior abdominal wall extending to the umbilicus known as the median umbilical ligament. Failure of the urachus to completely degenerate (persistent urachus) results in a number of clinical complications, depending on the degree of patency of the urachus. A totally patent urachus creates a fistulous urinary tract between the bladder and the umbilicus. At other times, only the umbilical end, the bladder end, or the central urachal region remains patent, which gives rise to urachal cysts. These cysts are potential sites of bladder adenocarcinomas.  \n\n【7】Answer A is incorrect. Bladder exstrophy is a congenital developmental anomaly resulting from failure of the abdominal wall to close during embryogenesis. This causes the posterior bladder wall to protrude through the lower abdominal wall. It is not a complication of a patent urachus.  \n\n【8】Answer C is incorrect. Meckel diverticulum is the most frequent congenital anomaly found in the gastrointestinal tract, and it is caused by persistence of the omphalomesenteric duct. It is often asymptomatic but can present with rectal bleeding, volvulus, intussusception, and obstruction. Meckel diverticulum can be remembered by the “ rule of 2s: ” found in 2 % of the population, commonly presents around age 2 years, measures 2 inches long, can be found 2 feet from the ileocecal valve, and often contains 2 types of epithelia (gastric and pancreatic).  \n\n【9】Answer D is incorrect. Polycystic kidney disease is a hereditary disease characterized by bilateral development of multiple cysts in the renal parenchyma, ultimately leading to renal failure. There are two forms of polycystic kidney disease: adult autosomal dominant (ADPKD) and childhood autosomal recessive (ARPKD). They are caused by distinct genes. ADPKD has been mapped to the PKD1 and PKD2 genes, which code for the integral membrane proteins polycystin-1 and polycystin-2, respectively. ARPKD is caused by mutations in the PKHD1 gene, which codes for a large protein called fibrocystin. Neither ADPKD nor ARPKD is a complication of a patent urachus.  \n\n【10】Answer E is incorrect. Ectopic kidney is a condition that arises from development of a kidney at an unusual anatomic location. Most ectopic kidneys are found either within the pelvis or just above the pelvic brim. Functionally, these kidneys are normal; however, the ureter may kink, leading to urinary flow stagnation that predisposes to recurrent bacterial infections. Ectopic kidney is not a complication of a patent urachus.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:36:11", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:36:33", "cost": 22.32}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:45:57", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:36:33", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:36:10"}

What if the patient lived in a rural setting?\n\n【41】Are there any demographic characteristics that might affect this case?\n\n【42】Are there any standardized guidelines that you should use to assess or treat this case?\n\n【43】RESOLUTION\n\n【44】Diagnostic tests： Diagnostic studies to identify a truncal rash can include tests for viruses， bacteria， or fungi. A Tzanck smear of a vesicle scraping would show multinucleated cells if the rash is due to varicella or herpes simplex virus. Additionally， viral culture and direct fluorescent antigen testing(DFA) can be done to differentiate between the two. DFA is more sensitive and much faster than viral culture. If the rash is found to be varicella， polymerase chain reaction (PCR) will assist in determining whether the rash is a wild-type varicella virus or vaccine-induced varicella. If there is any suspicion of a fungal infection， a potassium hydroxide (KOH) smear test can be performed to assess for the presence of hyphae. However， the description of Angela’s vesicular rash does not appear to be fungal in origin. In the presence of a sore throat and rash， a bacterial culture for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus may be performed. No imaging studies are required.\n\n【45】What is the most likely differential diagnosis and why?\n\n【46】Breakthrough varicella zoster virus (VZV)， also known as chickenpox：\n\n【47】Key diagnostic clues are the description of the rash as maculopapular with vesicles； the history of a low-grade fever， cough， and rhinitis； and the absence of cervical lymphadenopathy. Angela did not get her second VZV vaccine， and a single dose is only 70%-90% effective for preventing VZV.\n\n【48】As always， other possible diagnoses must be considered. A truncal rash could be shingles， but it is also caused by VZV and only develops after prior infection with the chickenpox. Furthermore， the distribution would most likely be limited to one dermatome. Since Angela reported a sore throat， scarlet fever associated with strep pharyngitis would be part of the differential. However， the scarlet fever rash is often described as a “sandpaper rash，\" and lacks vesicles. With Angela's symp-toms， the rash could also be a viral exanthema. But in the case of a viral exanthema， Angela would likely have a more generalized truncal rash. Lyme disease， with its classic “bulls-eye\" rash， must be considered—but this rash is not vesicular. Finally， tinea corporis would be a possible diagnosis； however， Angela's rash does not have erythematous raised edges or central clearing as is common with tinea infections.\n\n【49】Wild-type chickenpox， caused by the varicella zoster virus， is an easily identifiable disease. It is typically a maculopapular rash with vesicles， characteristically with lesions beginning on the trunk and spreading distally. The lesions may be in different stages of healing. A VZV vaccine was intro-duced in 1995， but one dose is only 70%-90% effective for preventing VZV. It is currently recom mended that children get 2 doses of the VZV vaccine. It has been estimated that approximately 7%of children who received only one dose of the VZV vaccine developed VZV over a 10-year period， while only 2.2% of children who received 2 doses developed VZV. In cases of breakthrough VZV， there are often less than 50 lesions， and many times less than 10 lesions. Furthermore， in breakthrough varicella， the rash may be primarily maculopapular with few， if any， vesicles. Typically， the unvac-cinated child who contracts chickenpox will have an average of 300-400 vesicles and perhaps， up to1000 vesicles. It is important for the health care provider to understand that breakthrough varicelle infections present differently， and much less acutely， than classic wild-type VZV. If the history and physical presentation of the rash are consistent with VZV， no diagnostic tests are usually done.\n\n【50】What is your plan of treatment， referral， and follow-up care?\n\n【51】Breakthrough VZV is a self-limiting disease. The management is primarily supportive： diphenhydr-amine for itching and acetaminophen for fever and pain management. Oatmeal baths can be used to 删除换行1: ameliorate itching. Angela should stay home from school until all of her lesions have dried and crusted. Aspirin should be avoided due to the risk of Reye syndrome in children.

She is accompanied by her mother， Jane. Angela has also had a mildly runny nose and cough for 3 days. She has had a low-grade fever， and her maximum temperature at home was 37.9℃ (oral). Angela has had no vomit-ing or diarrhea.\n\n【3】Diet： Normally has a balanced diet with enough dairy， protein， fruits， and vegetables. There has been no change in appetite since her symptoms began1.\n\n【4】Elimination： Voiding well with no complaints of dysuria.\n\n【5】Sleep： Sleeps approximately 9 hours at night and has no problems falling asleep or staying asleep.\n\n【6】Past medical history： She was born via cesarean section at 38 weeks’ gestation for a breech presenta-tion. Since being discharged home at 4 days of age， she has had no hospitalizations. Angela had an emergency department visit at 5 years of age for sutures to her head after she fell and struck her head on the corner of a table. She has had no injuries or illnesses since that time\n\n【7】Family history： Angela's mother (34 years old) has a history of migraine headaches. Her father (30years old) is healthy and has no history of chronic medical conditions. Her 5-year-old sibling has type I diabetes. Her maternal grandmother (68 years old) has type II diabetes. Her maternal grand-father (68 years old) has a history of COPD. Angela's paternal grandfather (58 years old) has a history of skin cancer. Her paternal grandmother (53 years old) has hypertension.\n\n【8】Social history： Angela currently attends elementary school. She is in the second grade and is doing well according to her mother. Angela lives at home with her parents and her 5-year-old sibling. Her father is a graduate student， and her mother is an accountant.

What if the patient lived in a rural setting?\n\n【41】Are there any demographic characteristics that might affect this case?\n\n【42】Are there any standardized guidelines that you should use to assess or treat this case?\n\n【43】RESOLUTION\n\n【44】Diagnostic tests： Diagnostic studies to identify a truncal rash can include tests for viruses， bacteria， or fungi. A Tzanck smear of a vesicle scraping would show multinucleated cells if the rash is due to varicella or herpes simplex virus. Additionally， viral culture and direct fluorescent antigen testing(DFA) can be done to differentiate between the two. DFA is more sensitive and much faster than viral culture. If the rash is found to be varicella， polymerase chain reaction (PCR) will assist in determining whether the rash is a wild-type varicella virus or vaccine-induced varicella. If there is any suspicion of a fungal infection， a potassium hydroxide (KOH) smear test can be performed to assess for the presence of hyphae. However， the description of Angela’s vesicular rash does not appear to be fungal in origin. In the presence of a sore throat and rash， a bacterial culture for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus may be performed. No imaging studies are required.\n\n【45】What is the most likely differential diagnosis and why?\n\n【46】Breakthrough varicella zoster virus (VZV)， also known as chickenpox：\n\n【47】Key diagnostic clues are the description of the rash as maculopapular with vesicles； the history of a low-grade fever， cough， and rhinitis； and the absence of cervical lymphadenopathy. Angela did not get her second VZV vaccine， and a single dose is only 70%-90% effective for preventing VZV.\n\n【48】As always， other possible diagnoses must be considered. A truncal rash could be shingles， but it is also caused by VZV and only develops after prior infection with the chickenpox. Furthermore， the distribution would most likely be limited to one dermatome. Since Angela reported a sore throat， scarlet fever associated with strep pharyngitis would be part of the differential. However， the scarlet fever rash is often described as a “sandpaper rash，\" and lacks vesicles. With Angela's symp-toms， the rash could also be a viral exanthema. But in the case of a viral exanthema， Angela would likely have a more generalized truncal rash. Lyme disease， with its classic “bulls-eye\" rash， must be considered—but this rash is not vesicular. Finally， tinea corporis would be a possible diagnosis； however， Angela's rash does not have erythematous raised edges or central clearing as is common with tinea infections.\n\n【49】Wild-type chickenpox， caused by the varicella zoster virus， is an easily identifiable disease. It is typically a maculopapular rash with vesicles， characteristically with lesions beginning on the trunk and spreading distally. The lesions may be in different stages of healing. A VZV vaccine was intro-duced in 1995， but one dose is only 70%-90% effective for preventing VZV. It is currently recom mended that children get 2 doses of the VZV vaccine. It has been estimated that approximately 7%of children who received only one dose of the VZV vaccine developed VZV over a 10-year period， while only 2.2% of children who received 2 doses developed VZV. In cases of breakthrough VZV， there are often less than 50 lesions， and many times less than 10 lesions. Furthermore， in breakthrough varicella， the rash may be primarily maculopapular with few， if any， vesicles. Typically， the unvac-cinated child who contracts chickenpox will have an average of 300-400 vesicles and perhaps， up to1000 vesicles. It is important for the health care provider to understand that breakthrough varicelle infections present differently， and much less acutely， than classic wild-type VZV. If the history and physical presentation of the rash are consistent with VZV， no diagnostic tests are usually done.\n\n【50】What is your plan of treatment， referral， and follow-up care?\n\n【51】Breakthrough VZV is a self-limiting disease. The management is primarily supportive： diphenhydr-amine for itching and acetaminophen for fever and pain management. Oatmeal baths can be used to 删除换行1: ameliorate itching. Angela should stay home from school until all of her lesions have dried and crusted. Aspirin should be avoided due to the risk of Reye syndrome in children. Acyclovir will not be helpful in Angela’s case because her rash appeared more than 24 hours before she presented to the office. The health care provider should inquire about the vaccination status of Angela’s brother and whether her parents have positive VZV titers， indicating immunity to the virus.\n\n【52】Does this patient's psychosocial history affect how you might treat this case?\n\n【53】Angela has no psychosocial characteristics that would alter management of her breakthrough VZV.\n\n【54】What if the patient lived in a rural setting?\n\n【55】If Angela lived in a rural setting， the consideration of tick-borne disease might be higher on the dif-ferential. However， living in an urban or suburban environment， excursions into rural places need to be considered.\n\n【56】Are there any demographic characteristics that might affect this case?\n\n【57】If Angela were immunocompromised or had contact with an immunocompromised patient， her VZV would be treated more aggressively.\n\n【58】Are there any standardized guidelines that you should use to assess or treat this case?\n\n【59】While there are no standardized guidelines for the management of VZV， the AAP has developed guidelines for the prevention of varicella 删除10：<u>(American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases， 2007)</u>.", "index": 2282, "show": true, "start": 2282, "end": 2465, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:43:09", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:43:50", "cost": 41.209}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:45:57", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:43:50", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:43:09"}

She presented to the student health service with a chief complaint of SOB, left-sided chest pain, and exertion-related episodes of presyncope, with one episode of frank syncope, promptly regaining consciousness after becoming supine on the ground. She was referred to an electrophysiologist at a nearby hospital for a same day evaluation of the syncopal episode and persistent tachycardia at 100 bpm (usual heart rate 60 bpm).\n\n【18】Her detailed clinical history included the onset of symptoms 6 weeks prior to presentation for medical evaluation. Although she was in a good state of physical fitness, she was unable to walk more than one block and developed lightheadedness and presyncope with stair climbing and with any of her ROTC activities. The syncopal episode occurred during ROTC exercises, two weeks before her clinic presentation, and she was suspended from any further military training until cleared medically. She denied any history of similar symptoms, surgical procedures, pregnancy, history of DVT/PE, chronic lower extremity edema, or injury. She did take a plane flight and went on a cruise 6 weeks before the onset of her symptoms. She did report starting estrogen-containing oral contraceptives 17 months before the onset of her first clinical symptoms, for the purpose of birth control and premenstrual dysphoric syndrome.\n\n【19】She had an unremarkable past medical history.\n\n【20】Her family history was notable for her father having experienced a deep venous thrombosis (DVT) without a known clotting disorder.\n\n【21】The physical examination was unremarkable, except for a resting heart rate of 120 bpm and respiratory rate of 20 per minute. The blood pressure was 100/70 mmHg. The resting pulse oximetry showed an O <sub>2 </sub> saturation of 99% on room air. A 12-lead electrocardiogram demonstrated normal findings with a sinus tachycardia. Laboratory studies were normal except for a mild elevation of the ALT at 50 U (normal range 5–35 U). A urine pregnancy test was negative.\n\n【22】Initial assessment included an echocardiogram which demonstrated a low normal LV ejection fraction at 50%, a severely increased RV size with severely decreased function, significant shift of the intraventricular septum into the LV cavity, a severely enlarged right atrium, mild tricuspid regurgitation with a RVSP estimated at 68 mmHg, and a small pericardial effusion. Injected agitated saline did show evidence of an intra-atrial right-to-left shunt at rest .\n\n【23】删除3：<u>Figure 16.1\n\n【24】Transthoracic echocardiogram showing signs of right ventricular strain</u>\n\n【25】This was followed by the acquisition of a CT angiogram of the chest. This revealed bilateral pulmonary emboli affecting the proximal lobar vessels of the right upper and bilateral lower lobes, extending into the segmental branches. Partially occluding thrombi are seen within the segmental left upper lobe branches and a large thrombus is visible in the left lower lobe pulmonary artery extending into the segmental branches. There was a small infiltrate versus atelectasis in the anterior left lung base, and a small amount of anterior pericardial fluid .\n\n【26】删除3：<u>Figure 16.2\n\n【27】Axial ( a ) and coronal views ( b , c ) of the CT angiogram demonstrating extensive proximal vessel intraluminal defects in both lungs consistent with acute pulmonary emboli.

The clinical history related was consistent with a possible pulmonary embolic event as long as 6 weeks prior; however her presentation was prompted by worsening symptoms that were hemodynamically significant.\n\n【30】She was transferred to a tertiary hospital as the patient and parents requested additional consults prior to moving forward with thrombolysis given lack of consensus in the treatment plan. Hematology and Pulmonary Hypertension/Cardiology consults were obtained and achieved consensus was to withhold lytic therapy for concern that she had acute on chronic pulmonary emboli.\n\n【31】A lung ventilation-perfusion scan was recommended. (Hospital Day # 3) This showed extensive modest to large sized peripherally located wedge shaped perfusion defects bilaterally throughout the lungs, consistent with findings of pulmonary emboli by CT .\n\n【32】删除3：<u>Figure 16.3\n\n【33】Several unmatched, large perfusion defects, particularly apparent throughout the right lung and medial left lower lobe (posterior view)</u>\n\n【34】On hospital day 6, a right heart catheterization was performed: BP 99/66 mmHg, mean arterial pressure 79 mmHg, HR 77 bpm, pulse oximetry on room air 99%. RA mean 6 mmHg , RV 40/6 mmHg, PA pressure 40/17 (25 mean) mmHg, PCWP 6 mmHg; PA saturation 67.3%; cardiac output 4.5 L/min with a cardiac index 2.43 L/min/m <sup>2 </sup> ; transpulmonary gradient was 19 mmHg.\n\n【35】Concurrent with her catheterization, pulmonary angiography was obtained. This demonstrated pronounced filling defects in the left lower pulmonary arteries and smaller filling defects in the segmental and subsegmental levels; there were filling defects in the right upper, middle, and lower lobe pulmonary arteries at the lobar and segmental levels .\n\n【36】删除3：<u>Figure 16.4\n\n【37】Intraluminal filling defects apparent  in both descending pulmonary arteries, as well as in the segmental vessels of the right upper lobe, right lower lobe and lingula</u>\n\n【38】By hospital day 12, she was discharged in stable condition. She was at a therapeutic level on warfarin therapy (patient refused Eliquis). She was hemodynamically stable and ambulatory. Thrombolytic therapy was never given, as the consensus of opinions was that she had acute pulmonary emboli on top of significant chronic thrombi. The oral contraceptive (OCP) drugs were discontinued on admission.\n\n【39】Six weeks after hospital discharge the patient was working full-time in a restaurant in her hometown, was increasing her activities and doing well. She was stable on 8 mg of warfarin daily. By eleven weeks after hospital discharge, the patient was feeling fine with no complaints. She was participating in a yoga class and sailing. She also underwent a HAST study for a planned vacation trip to San Diego and did not require oxygen for the flight. She denied dyspnea with her activities, though still had not regained her usual physical activity level yet. Her physical examination was unremarkable. Hypercoagulable lab studies all came back negative. A limited echocardiogram showed normal RV size, with mildly decreased systolic function (40%), and a PA systolic pressure estimated at 23 mmHg, Chest radiograph findings were “normal” and a lung ventilation-perfusion scan documented resolution of the previously observed perfusion defects .\n\n【40】删除3：<u>Figure 16.5\n\n【41】Return of an essentially normal perfusion pattern in both lungs</u>\n\n【42】At the time of her six month follow up, the patient was clinically doing well and had resumed all prior activities including the exercise required by ROTC training. She discontinued her warfarin without recurrence of any concerning symptoms (WHO Functional Class I). Echocardiogram findings: normal RV size and function; PASP 21 mmHg, TAPSE 26 mm, normal IVC, and no effusion.\n\n【43】Radiographic Interpretation\n---------------------------\n\n【44】CTPA demonstrates acute and subacute pulmonary embolism. There are central filling defects surrounded by rim of contrast medium in multiple segmental pulmonary artery branches, characteristic of acute emboli. Clot retraction to the periphery of the vessel in the distal right main pulmonary artery is likely due to clot reorganisation and recanalization and is indicative of the subacute nature of the process. There is near complete occlusion of left lower lobe and right upper lobe arteries. Whilst this can be seen with both acute and chronic thromboembolic disease, the vessel is typically distended in acute PE and becomes fibrosed and attenuated with progression to CTEPH. Other angiographic features of CTEPH include pouch defects, intravascular webs and stenosis with or without post-stenotic dilatation (Castañer et al.). Systemic collaterals also take time to develop and are therefore not a feature of acute PE. Another useful clue to the chronicity of the disease on CT is the presence of geographical variation in lung parenchymal attenuation, termed as ‘mosaic attenuation’.\n\n【45】It is possible to evaluate the cardiac chambers even on a non-ECG gated CTPA. The diameter ratio of right to left ventricle on transverse CT sections has the strongest predictive value and most robust evidence base for adverse clinical outcomes in acute PE. A RV/LV ratio ≥1.0 has been shown to have a 2.5-fold risk for all-cause mortality and a fivefold risk for PE–related mortality (Meinel at al.). On this study, there is dilatation of the right ventricle, under-filled small left ventricular cavity size (RV:LV > 1.5) with flattening of interventricular septum.\n\n【46】The appearances of catheter pulmonary angiography mirror that of CTPA with multifocal, predominantly central filling defects bilaterally associated with large wedge shaped perfusion defects. Similar bilateral wedge shaped segmental mismatched perfusion defects are also seen on the VQ scintigraphy. Unlike CTPA, it is difficult to differentiate acute and chronic thromboembolic disease solely using scintigraphy as both can produce similar defects. A baseline VQ at presentation can be very useful to follow the temporal evolution of the disease but perfusion deficits can be persistent for up to 12 months after the initial event and do not necessarily equate to CTEPH (Nijkeuter et al.). Happily in this case, the follow-up VQ shows complete resolution of the perfusion defects, effectively excluding progression to CTEPH.\n\n【47】A small proportion of patients labelled as acute PE at the time of initial presentation actually have acute on chronic thromboembolic disease (Guérin et al.). This is an important distinction to make as they have very different therapeutic options. Of the various imaging modalities, CTPA is the non-invasive method of choice for differentiating the two conditions, particularly in an emergency setting.\n\n【48】Clinical Comments\n-----------------\n\n【49】Though this patient was initially referred for pulmonary thromboendarterectomy surgery, there were a number of considerations that supported a more conservative approach. Available information does suggest that when cardiopulmonary symptoms are presented for greater than 2 weeks at the time of initial presentation, that there’s a higher likelihood that some component of chronic thromboembolic disease may be present. Though the presence of RV enlargement and strain are concerning, this in itself is not a distinguishing feature between an acute pulmonary embolic event versus the presence of chronic thromboembolic disease. The absence of RVH, the CT appearance of the thrombus, the absence of pulmonary vascular changes that are associated with organized, recanalized thrombus as described by Dr. Gopalan, and the absence of other findings that might suggest long-time pulmonary arterial obstruction, such as bronchial arterial collateral blood vessels—as was the situation in this case—makes acute or subacute pulmonary emboli the most likely diagnosis. The pulmonary hemodynamic profile as well supported the diagnosis of a more acute pulmonary embolic event. The classic findings of Sutton and colleagues in the 1970s established that with an acute PE, a modest rise in pulmonary pressures are to be expected given the limitations of a “unconditioned” RV presented with an abrupt rise in vascular resistance. For those with chronic thromboembolic disease, however, the right ventricle has been able to compensate for the longstanding elevation in RV afterload, and pulmonary pressures at presentation can be significantly elevated.\n\n【50】Points of Emphasis\n------------------\n\n【51】With the availability of numerous interventional modalities to treat acute and chronic thromboembolic disease, especially for clinically decompensating patients, it becomes increasingly important to be able to distinguish between clinical entities.\n\n【52】Diagnosis\n---------\n\n【53】1.  1.\n\n【54】    Acute pulmonary emboli with right heart strain.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 13:51:40", "endTime": "2024/09/14 13:51:56", "cost": 16.369}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:45:57", "update_time": "2024-09-13 21:51:56", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 21:51:40"}

The definition of an aneurysm is an abnormal focal  删除换行1: permanent dilatation of all the layers of a blood vessel. An AAA is defined when the aortic  删除换行1: diameter, as measured below the level of the renal arteries, is one and a half times normal. \n\n【12】Women have smaller aortas, but for convenience, more than 3 cm qualifies as aneurysmal. \n\n【13】The main risk factors for aneurysm formation are male gender, smoking, hypertension, \n\n【14】Caucasian/European descent and atherosclerosis.

It may also be important to consider how Keisha would feel about the potential of not having a monthly period.

The clinician should also explore Keisha’s need to keep her contraceptive method private and how each method may or may not achieve this goal.

His past history is significant for hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, and coronary artery disease status postmyocardial infarction. His current medications are propranolol, captopril, aspirin, lovastatin, metformin, fluoxetine, and sublingual nitroglycerin. On further questioning, he admits to wanting a prescription for sildenafil. Which of his medications is unsafe to take with sildenafil?\n\n【1】> (A) Aspirin\n\n【2】> (B) Captopril\n\n【3】> (C) Fluoxetine\n\n【4】> (D) Lovastatin\n\n【5】> (E) Metformin\n\n【6】> (F) Nitroglycerin\n\n【7】> (G) Propranolol\n\n【8】 Answer: The correct answer is F. As is common for many older patients, this man is taking several prescription medications. Though a couple of his prescriptions should be used with caution with sildenafil (captopril and propranolol), the only one that might significantly interact with sildenafil is sublingual nitroglycerin. Nitroglycerin is used for prompt relief of an ongoing attack of angina precipitated by exercise or emotional stress. Nitrates relax vascular smooth muscle by their intracellular conversion to nitrite ions and then to nitric oxide, which in turn activates cGMP and increases the cell’s cGMP level. Elevated cGMP ultimately causes vascular smooth muscle relaxation. This is the same mechanism sildenafil uses to cause smooth muscle relaxation and increased blood flow into the corpus cavernosum at a certain level of sexual stimulation. Using these drugs together can lead to severe hypotension and cardiovascular collapse.  \n\n【9】Answer A is incorrect. Aspirin and sildenafil have no known dangerous interactions.  \n\n【10】Answer B is incorrect. Captopril and sildenafil have no known dangerous interactions, though the combination may increase the risk of hypotension-related adverse effects. However, the captopril is probably contributing to his erectile dysfunction.  \n\n【11】Answer C is incorrect. Fluoxetine and sildenafil have no known dangerous interactions. However, the fluoxetine is probably contributing to his erectile dysfunction.  \n\n【12】Answer D is incorrect. Lovastatin and sildenafil have no known dangerous interactions.  \n\n【13】Answer E is incorrect. Metformin and sildenafil have no known dangerous interactions.  \n\n【14】Answer G is incorrect.

Two days later, the patient comes to the emergency department obtunded and oliguric, with a highly elevated creatinine level of 8.3 mg/dL. His wife reports that the only medication that he took besides his diuretic was “some ibuprofen for his headache.” Which of the following is the most likely reason for this patient’s sudden renal failure?\n\n【1】> (A) Decrease of prostaglandin E2 production in both arterioles of the kidney\n\n【2】> (B) Decrease of prostaglandin E2 production in the afferent arterioles of the kidney\n\n【3】> (C) Decrease of prostaglandin E2 production in the efferent arterioles of the kidney\n\n【4】> (D) Increase of prostaglandin E2 production in the afferent arterioles of the kidney\n\n【5】> (E) Increase of prostaglandin E2 production in the efferent arterioles of the kidney\n\n【6】 Answer: The correct answer is A. The photomicrograph shows Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules, which are pathognomonic for diabetic nephropathy. Even without recognizing this specific histopathology, however, one should be reminded of diabetes due to the combination of renal and visual findings (diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy). Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are the drugs of choice in the control of diabetes-induced renal disease because they reduce systemic blood pressure, reduce the effects of angiotensin II (AT II) on efferent arterioles, and attenuate the stimulatory effect of AT II on glomerular cell growth and matrix production. ACE inhibitors have been conclusively shown to delay the time to end-stage renal disease by 50% in type 1 diabetics and to significantly delay progression of renal disease in type 2 diabetics. All diabetics should begin ACE inhibitor therapy at the onset of microalbuminuria, even in the absence of hypertension. In addition, one should consider starting patients with diabetes on statins and low-dose aspirin as they are at a higher risk of coronary artery disease.  \n\n【7】Answer B is incorrect. β-Blockers are used to control essential hypertension, not diabetic nephropathy. These drugs have been shown to reduce mortality in patients with CHF.  \n\n【8】Answer C is incorrect. Cyclophosphamide is often used in conjunction with prednisone to treat immunologically mediated kidney disease.  \n\n【9】Answer D is incorrect. Prednisone is used to treat immune-mediated nephropathy, not diabetic nephropathy.  \n\n【10】Answer E is incorrect. Thiazides are often used in the initial treatment of hypertension, which could ultimately lead to renal failure.

This child most likely has retinoblastoma, a rapidly progressive neoplastic growth in the retina. Retinoblastoma may present in one eye, as in this patient, or bilaterally, as in approximately 30% of cases. The clinical vignette does not allude to any family history, in which case the retinoblastoma is called sporadic, in contrast with the familial form, which is associated with a family history. In either case, the disease is believed to arise from a loss-of-function mutation in the RBI gene. RBI is a tumor suppressor gene that normally binds the E2F transcription factor complex in quiescent cells, which prevents the cell from progressing through the G1 /S checkpoint. Under appropriate conditions for cell replication, E2F is released when the Rb protein becomes phosphorylated by cyclins D and E, and their associated cyclin-dependant kinases (CDK 2, 4, and 6). Loss of function of the RBI gene is associated with osteosarcoma and retinoblastoma. According to the two-hit hypothesis, both copies of the RBI gene in a single retinoblast must be mutated in order to cause cancer. In inherited cases, the first hit is carried in the germline. A second hit to any retinoblast will result in cancer, making it more likely that multiple tumors will occur. In sporadic cases, both hits have to occur in the same retinoblast. This is a rare event, therefore tumors are typically solitary and more often occur later in life.  \n\n【7】Answer A is incorrect. p53, not Rb, plays an important regulatory role in apoptosis.  \n\n【8】Answer C is incorrect. The G2 /M checkpoint is another important cell-cycle regulatory checkpoint. It provides another opportunity to prevent the cell from undergoing mitosis should the environment be inappropriate for cell replication or there is DNA damage. Some important regulatory proteins at the G2 /M checkpoint include the CHK1 and CHK2 kinases through interactions with G2 \\-specific cyclin A and CDK2.  \n\n【9】Answer D is incorrect. The Rb protein does not promote DNA damage repair. This function is often associated with p53, which is a protein that like Rb, promotes cell-cycle arrest in the presence of DNA damage (or other factors that do not constitute a favorable environment for successful cell replication). In addition, it also initiates the apoptotic cascade in the presence of overwhelming DNA damage that cannot be repaired by the cell.  \n\n【10】Answer E is incorrect. The Rb protein does not promote histone acetylation. In fact, the Rb-E2F complex promotes histone deacetylation on chromatin.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:03:21", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:04:37", "cost": 75.535}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:45:57", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:04:36", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:03:20"}

The diagnosis of adrenal leio-myosarcoma is based on histopathologic and immu-nohistochemical findings， as demonstrated in the case presented herein.

However, worldwide epidemics have occurred at different times in history due to rapid changes in viral genetic makeup. Which of the following is the most important reason why these sporadic worldwide epidemics occur?\n\n【1】> (A) Antigenic drift\n\n【2】> (B) Antigenic shift\n\n【3】> (C) Hemagglutinin develops the ability to destroy a component of mucin, becoming more infectious\n\n【4】> (D) Neuraminidase develops the ability to attach to sialic acid receptors, becoming more infectious\n\n【5】> (E) RBCs agglutinate with certain strains\n\n【6】 Answer: The correct answer is B. Influenza virus has both hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) molecules on its surface. These two molecules are responsible for the ability of the virus to be absorbed and penetrate the host cells. After a human is infected with the influenza virus, that person will be immune to infection by the same virus because of antibodies created against HA and NA. If either HA or NA is changed, as can be the case if two different influenza viruses infect the same cell and exchange RNA, antigenic shift can occur. This creates a new virus that has never been exposed to the human immune system before, with potentially catastrophic consequences. This type of mixing is most commonly thought to be between a human and an avian strain mixing in an intermediary porcine host, thus leading to the term “avian flu.”  \n\n【7】Answer A is incorrect. Antigenic drift describes mutations that can occur in hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, making them less antigenic to the preexisting antibodies in the human host. Since this results in small changes in viral toxicity, it will lead to a slightly different strain, but it is not likely to lead to a global epidemic.  \n\n【8】Answer C is incorrect. Hemagglutinin has the ability to attach to sialic acid receptors, which activates fusion of the virus to the cell. All infectious influenza viruses have this molecule.  \n\n【9】Answer D is incorrect. Neuraminidase has the ability to destroy neuraminic acid, a component of mucin. This helps break down the barrier to the upper airways and aids in infectivity.  \n\n【10】Answer E is incorrect.

He had a mild case oftraveler’s diarrhea while there，recovered within a week， and has otherwise felt well. On examination， he is a well-developed man who appears to be moderately ill. His temperature is 99.8F (37.6℃)， his blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg， his pulse is 90 beats/min， and his respiratory rate is 14 breaths/min.

Along with a general physical examination， certain areas should be emphasized. Jaundice typically remains undetected on examination until the serum bilirubin level is at least greater than twice the normal upper limit， approaching 4 mg/dL. The yellow pigmentation may initially be detected as a yel-lowing of the sclera， especially in persons with darker skin types. Yellow discolor-ation can also commonly be seen in oral mucosal membranes such as under the tongue and hard palate.Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia， usually identified as an incidental finding when liver enzymes are tested for some other reason， in a patient without jaundice or known underlying hepatic dysfunction， is often caused by Gilbert syndrome. Gilbert syndrome is a congenital reduction of conjugation of bilirubin in the liver due to an autosomal recessive gene involved in glucuronidation. It occurs in approx-imately 5% of the population and is of no health significance. Patients generally present with normal physical examination and routine laboratory tests， except for icterus and mild unconjugated (2-4 mg/dL) hyperbilirubinemia. It is also more commonly diagnosed in males due to higher daily bilirubin production.Occasion-ally， the bilirubin level will increase during times of stress， illness， fasting， and then recover to its baseline， slightly elevated level (usually <3 mg/mL)， after the illness resolves. In a patient with mildly elevated unconjugated bilirubinemia， otherwise normal liver enzymes， thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)， and complete blood count (CBC)， and who is otherwise well， no further workup is indicated.\n\n【7】Hemolysis can cause an unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in proportion to the amount of hemolysis that occurs. It is most often diagnosed by the identification of anemia along with the presence of red cell fragments on peripheral smear， and elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase and haptoglobin. The serum bilirubin level typically remains below 5 mg/dL in hemolytic conditions such as spherocytosis， thalassemias， sickle cell disease， glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency， malaria， thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)， and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). The treatment is to treat the underlying cause of the hemolysis.\n\n【8】Hepatitis A is an acute viral infection of the liver primarily transmitted via fecal-oral contamination and accounts for 30% of acute viral hepatitis in the United States. Contaminated food and water are the primary sources of infection， although risks also include drug use (both injection and noninjection)， male-male sexual contact， household and sexual contact with another infected individual， and working in a daycare setting. Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is also more widespread among those who live in low socioeconomic areas likely due to inadequate sanitation and hygiene practices. Hepatitis A infection is widespread in Africa， Asia， Greenland， Middle East， Mexico， and Central and South America. Travelers to these areas are at risk for infection and should be immunized prior to travel with two separate immuniza-tions 6 months apart.chronic hepatitis B or C infection. The average incubation period is 25 to 50 days and transmission is possible 2 weeks prior to the development of symptoms and for 1 week after jaundice appears. While the symptoms can resemble a mild flu-like illness， or even be asymptomatic in younger patients， there is an approximately0.1% to 1% fatality rate which increases in those over age 40. The icteric phase commonly lasts for 6 to 8 weeks. Most persons will recover from the associated fatigue within 3 months， although some people have an illness that will last up to6 months. While there is no specific treatment for hepatitis A， supportive care and symptomatic treatments are indicated. Patients who develop fulminant hepatitis should be hospitalized in a facility with liver transplant capability.Effective measures in preventing HAV transmission include adequate hand washing， avoidance of contaminated foods and water， and proper food handling and preparation. Hepatitis A vaccination is recommended for children aged 12 to18 in identified high-risk counties， travelers to endemic areas， persons with chronic liver disease or chronic clotting-factor disorders， men who have sex with men， IV drug users， HIV-infected individuals， and workers with a high risk of exposure including food handlers， in addition to anyone who desires immunity to hepatitis A. Household or sexual contacts of persons infected with hepatitis A and previ-ously unvaccinated can be offered postexposure prophylaxis with hepatitis A vac-cination or Ig. Ig is preferred in patients for whom vaccine is contraindicated，adults greater than 40 years， immunocompromised individuals， and those who have been diagnosed with chronic liver disease.\n\n【9】Hepatitis B has infected over 2 billion people worldwide and there are currently350 million chronic carriers， of whom a million will die from hepatitis B virus(HBV)-associated liver disease each year. Areas of the world with intermediate-to-high rates of infections are Eastern Europe， Asia， sub-Saharan Africa， Middle East， and the Pacific islands. Hepatitis B is a viral infection transmitted via contact with contaminated blood or body fluids. Sexual contact (eg， men having sex with men， multiple partners， and sexual contact with an infected person) and needle sharing are common mechanisms of infection in the United States. Hepatitis B may also be vertically transmitted from mother to baby. The incubation period from exposure to clinical symptoms is 6 to 24 weeks. Only 50% of infections with hepatitis B are symptomatic. Up to 5% of the world’s population is affected with chronic HBV infection and approximately 1% of infections result in hepatic failure and death. Along with the acute-phase symptoms， which are similar to hepatitis A， hepatitis B can cause a chronic infection. The risk of developing chronic hepatitis B is inversely related to the age at infection90% of infected infants， 20% to 50% of children 删除换行1: younger than age 5， and less than 5% infected adults-develop chronic hepatitis B， which can lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatitis B causes up to80%of cases of hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide.\n\n【10】Serologic evaluation is necessary to determine the presence and type of hepati-tis B infection. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is present in both acute and chronic infections and viral load is associated with risk of transmission to others. HBsAg typically becomes detectable in 1 to 10 weeks following HBV exposure and disappears in 4 to 6 months in those who subsequently recover and clear the virus spontaneously. Persistent detection of HBsAg after 6 months postexposure gener-ally indicates chronic HBV infection. Hepatitis e antigen (HBeAg) is accepted as a marker for HBV replication and degree of infectivity. Patients with the HBeAg are 100 times more infectious than those lacking this antigen. Antibody to the sur-face antigen (anti-HBs) in the absence of HBsAg is seen in resolved infections and is the serologic marker produced after hepatitis B vaccination. An IgM antibody to the hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBcAg IgM) is diagnostic of an acute H BV infection. Anti-H BcAg IgM is the only serologic marker detectable during the window period of seroconversion. A measurable level of H BsAg with a negative anti-H BcAg IgM is diagnostic of chronic hepatitis B. Figures 46-1 and 46-2 show the serologic stud-ies associated with acute hepatitis B infection and chronic hepatitis B infection， respectively.Figure 46-1. Serolog ic Markers in Acute Hepatitis B Infection With Recovery.Figure 46-2. Serologic Markers in Chronic Hepatitis B Infection.Hepatitis C (HCV) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in the United States， with more than 3 million infected persons. Infection is most preva-lent in persons born between 1945 and 1965， the majority of whom were likely infected during the 1970s and 1980s. Approximately 2% to 3%(130-170 million) of the world population has been infected with the HCV. Transmission occurs via exposure to infected blood or body fluids via sexual contact and use of illicit drugs， sharing of needles and other drug paraphernalia，tattooing， accidental expo-sure of health-care workers， or by vertical transmission. Blood or blood-product transfusion and organ transplantation from infected donors were common sources of exposure prior to 1992.\n\n【11】H CV can be detected in the blood within 1 to 3 weeks of exposure， followed by an acute hepatitis C infection between 2 and 12 weeks of postexposure， with liver cell injury detectable in 4 to 12 weeks. Most infections are asymptomatic， yet hepatitis C can also cause an acute illness with jaundice， abdominal pain， malaise， and anorexia. Of those infected with hepatitis C， 60%to 80%will develop a chronic infection， with measurable levels of hepatitis C virus RNA (HCV RNA) for more than 6 months.\n\n【12】Chronic hepatitis C can lead to cirrhosis， hepatic decompensation， and hepato-cellular carcinoma. Up to 30% of those with chronic HCV infection will develop cirrhosis during a 20-to 30-year time frame， making hepatitis C the current leading cause for liver transplantation in the United States. Patients with HCV infection should avoid alcohol consumption， acetaminophen， and nonsteroidal anti-inflam-matory drugs (N SAIDs)， and should receive hepatitis A and B vaccinations to pre-vent rapid disease progression and risk of coinfection. The progression of chronic H CV infection can be assessed by the amount of inflammation and cirrhosis seen on liver biopsy， which is commonly performed to evaluate extent of fibrosis andHepatitis D is a rare cause of viral hepatitis in the United States that uses the viral envelope of hepatitis B to infect its host and thus requires coinfection of hepatitis B and D. It is commonly encountered in patients infected with HIV. Approximately 5% of HBV carriers may be coinfected with hepatitis D worldwide. It is endemic in the Mediterranean， Middle East， the Pacific islands， and South America. The clinical manifestations of HBV and hepatitis D virus (HDV) coin-fection typically resemble that of an HBV infection. In coinfection， 10% or less will become chronically infected. Interferon is the only approved drug for treating chronic hepatitis D. Hepatitis B vaccine is the mainstay in HDV prevention. There is currently no vaccination available for hepatitis D.\n\n【13】Hepatitis E is transmitted via the fecal-oral route and while it is rare in the United States， it has a high prevalence in Asia， Africa， Middle East， and Central America. The incubation period is 4 to 5 weeks. The clinical signs and symptoms of hepa-titis E virus (HEV) infection are generally more severe compared to those seen in HAV with a greater likelihood of prolonged cholestasis. It has a very high mortality rate， mostly in the third trimester for pregnant women. Malnourished individuals or those with underlying liver disease are also more likely to develop fulminant hepa-titis. Diagnosis of acute HEV infection can be confirmed by detection of HEV in serum or stool or IgM anti-HEV.Treatment is supportive. Ig prophylaxis is available in countries where HEV is endemic， but its efficacy remains unproven. There is cur-rently no vaccination available for hepatitis E.\n\n【14】Alcohol abuse can cause an acute severe hepatitis， chronic fatty liver disease，hep-atitis， cirrhosis， and fibrosis. Alcohol leads to a conjugated hyperbilirubinemia by impairing bile acid secretion and uptake. Common physical findings include ascites， jaundice， cutaneous telangiectasias， palmer erythema， testicular atrophy， gyneco-mastia， and malnutrition. Transaminase levels from alcohol abuse typically show an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) out of proportion to the alanine aminotransferase(ALT)， commonly with a ratio of 2 or greater； y-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels are often abnormal in alcohol hepatitis； viral hepatitis usually causes greater eleva-tions of the ALT 删除25：<u></u>.hypertriglyceridemia. Rapid weight loss and protein-calorie malnutrition may also lead to NAFLD. One of the leading causes of liver disease， up to 25% of persons with NAFLD may have underlying cirrhosis. While most cases are asymptomatic and detectable only via elevated serum transaminases， symptoms may mimic those of acute viral hepatitis. There are currently no acceptable treatments for NAFLD， yet appropriate nutrition， weight management， and avoidance of alcohol are recommended.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【4】》", "content": "【0】CASE 46\n\n【1】A 33-year-old African-American man presents to the office for an acute visit with nausea and diarrhea present for the past week. Along with these symptoms，he has had a low-grade fever， some right upper quadrant (RUQ) abdominal pain， and has noticed that the whites ofhis eyes appear yellow. He has no significant medical history and takes no medications regularly. He denies alcohol， tobacco， or Ⅳ drug use at any time in his life. He works as a pastor in a local church that went on a mission to build a medical clinic in a ruralarea of Central America about5 weeks ago. He had a mild case oftraveler’s diarrhea while there，recovered within a week， and has otherwise felt well. On examination， he is a well-developed man who appears to be moderately ill. His temperature is 99.8F (37.6℃)， his blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg， his pulse is 90 beats/min， and his respiratory rate is 14 breaths/min. He has a prominent yellow color to his sclera and under his tongue. His mucous membranes are moist. Lung and cardiac examinations are unremarkable. His abdomen examination reveals normal bowel sounds yet mod-erate tenderness in the RUQ. His liver edge is palpable just below the costal mar-gin and his spleen is not palpable. There are no abdominal masses palpated， and no rebound tenderness or guarding. On rectal examination， he has clay-colored soft stool that is fecal occult blood test negative.\n\n【2】What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【3】When and how did he most probably contract this illness?\n\n【4】》How can you confirm the diagnosis?\n\n【5】What is the treatment at this point?\n\n【6】 46：Summary： A 33-year-old man with no significant medical history develops diarrhea， abdominal pain， and jaundice about a month after traveling to Central America.He is noted to have scleral icterus and tender hepatomegaly.Most probable timing and source of infection： Ingestion of contaminated food or water while on his mission to Central America 5 weeks earlier.A comprehensive physical examination is also paramount in the workup of the patient with jaundice. Along with a general physical examination， certain areas should be emphasized. Jaundice typically remains undetected on examination until the serum bilirubin level is at least greater than twice the normal upper limit， approaching 4 mg/dL. The yellow pigmentation may initially be detected as a yel-lowing of the sclera， especially in persons with darker skin types. Yellow discolor-ation can also commonly be seen in oral mucosal membranes such as under the tongue and hard palate.Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia， usually identified as an incidental finding when liver enzymes are tested for some other reason， in a patient without jaundice or known underlying hepatic dysfunction， is often caused by Gilbert syndrome. Gilbert syndrome is a congenital reduction of conjugation of bilirubin in the liver due to an autosomal recessive gene involved in glucuronidation. It occurs in approx-imately 5% of the population and is of no health significance. Patients generally present with normal physical examination and routine laboratory tests， except for icterus and mild unconjugated (2-4 mg/dL) hyperbilirubinemia. It is also more commonly diagnosed in males due to higher daily bilirubin production.Occasion-ally， the bilirubin level will increase during times of stress， illness， fasting， and then recover to its baseline， slightly elevated level (usually <3 mg/mL)， after the illness resolves. In a patient with mildly elevated unconjugated bilirubinemia， otherwise normal liver enzymes， thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)， and complete blood count (CBC)， and who is otherwise well， no further workup is indicated.\n\n【7】Hemolysis can cause an unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in proportion to the amount of hemolysis that occurs. It is most often diagnosed by the identification of anemia along with the presence of red cell fragments on peripheral smear， and elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase and haptoglobin. The serum bilirubin level typically remains below 5 mg/dL in hemolytic conditions such as spherocytosis， thalassemias， sickle cell disease， glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency， malaria， thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)， and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). The treatment is to treat the underlying cause of the hemolysis.\n\n【8】Hepatitis A is an acute viral infection of the liver primarily transmitted via fecal-oral contamination and accounts for 30% of acute viral hepatitis in the United States. Contaminated food and water are the primary sources of infection， although risks also include drug use (both injection and noninjection)， male-male sexual contact， household and sexual contact with another infected individual， and working in a daycare setting. Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is also more widespread among those who live in low socioeconomic areas likely due to inadequate sanitation and hygiene practices. Hepatitis A infection is widespread in Africa， Asia， Greenland， Middle East， Mexico， and Central and South America. Travelers to these areas are at risk for infection and should be immunized prior to travel with two separate immuniza-tions 6 months apart.chronic hepatitis B or C infection. The average incubation period is 25 to 50 days and transmission is possible 2 weeks prior to the development of symptoms and for 1 week after jaundice appears. While the symptoms can resemble a mild flu-like illness， or even be asymptomatic in younger patients， there is an approximately0.1% to 1% fatality rate which increases in those over age 40. The icteric phase commonly lasts for 6 to 8 weeks. Most persons will recover from the associated fatigue within 3 months， although some people have an illness that will last up to6 months. While there is no specific treatment for hepatitis A， supportive care and symptomatic treatments are indicated. Patients who develop fulminant hepatitis should be hospitalized in a facility with liver transplant capability.Effective measures in preventing HAV transmission include adequate hand washing， avoidance of contaminated foods and water， and proper food handling and preparation. Hepatitis A vaccination is recommended for children aged 12 to18 in identified high-risk counties， travelers to endemic areas， persons with chronic liver disease or chronic clotting-factor disorders， men who have sex with men， IV drug users， HIV-infected individuals， and workers with a high risk of exposure including food handlers， in addition to anyone who desires immunity to hepatitis A. Household or sexual contacts of persons infected with hepatitis A and previ-ously unvaccinated can be offered postexposure prophylaxis with hepatitis A vac-cination or Ig. Ig is preferred in patients for whom vaccine is contraindicated，adults greater than 40 years， immunocompromised individuals， and those who have been diagnosed with chronic liver disease.\n\n【9】Hepatitis B has infected over 2 billion people worldwide and there are currently350 million chronic carriers， of whom a million will die from hepatitis B virus(HBV)-associated liver disease each year. Areas of the world with intermediate-to-high rates of infections are Eastern Europe， Asia， sub-Saharan Africa， Middle East， and the Pacific islands. Hepatitis B is a viral infection transmitted via contact with contaminated blood or body fluids. Sexual contact (eg， men having sex with men， multiple partners， and sexual contact with an infected person) and needle sharing are common mechanisms of infection in the United States. Hepatitis B may also be vertically transmitted from mother to baby. The incubation period from exposure to clinical symptoms is 6 to 24 weeks. Only 50% of infections with hepatitis B are symptomatic. Up to 5% of the world’s population is affected with chronic HBV infection and approximately 1% of infections result in hepatic failure and death. Along with the acute-phase symptoms， which are similar to hepatitis A， hepatitis B can cause a chronic infection. The risk of developing chronic hepatitis B is inversely related to the age at infection90% of infected infants， 20% to 50% of children 删除换行1: younger than age 5， and less than 5% infected adults-develop chronic hepatitis B， which can lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatitis B causes up to80%of cases of hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide.\n\n【10】Serologic evaluation is necessary to determine the presence and type of hepati-tis B infection. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is present in both acute and chronic infections and viral load is associated with risk of transmission to others. HBsAg typically becomes detectable in 1 to 10 weeks following HBV exposure and disappears in 4 to 6 months in those who subsequently recover and clear the virus spontaneously. Persistent detection of HBsAg after 6 months postexposure gener-ally indicates chronic HBV infection. Hepatitis e antigen (HBeAg) is accepted as a marker for HBV replication and degree of infectivity. Patients with the HBeAg are 100 times more infectious than those lacking this antigen. Antibody to the sur-face antigen (anti-HBs) in the absence of HBsAg is seen in resolved infections and is the serologic marker produced after hepatitis B vaccination. An IgM antibody to the hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBcAg IgM) is diagnostic of an acute H BV infection. Anti-H BcAg IgM is the only serologic marker detectable during the window period of seroconversion. A measurable level of H BsAg with a negative anti-H BcAg IgM is diagnostic of chronic hepatitis B. Figures 46-1 and 46-2 show the serologic stud-ies associated with acute hepatitis B infection and chronic hepatitis B infection， respectively.Figure 46-1.

She has a medical history notable for obesity, coronary artery disease, type II diabetes mellitus, peripheral neuropathy and chronic venous insufficiency.

What is the mainstay of treatment?\n\n【7】Answer 30\n\n【8】i. This patient presents with lipodermatosclerosis, also known as sclerosing panniculitis. It is usually observed in the setting of chronic venous insufficiency. The pathogenesis is thought to occur as a result of venous hypertension, which leads to increased capillary permeability and leakage of fibrinogen. The presence of fibrinogen results in the formation of fibrin cuffs around vessels, which hinders oxygen exchange and leads to tissue anoxia. Additional factors that contribute to the pathogenesis of lipodermatosclerosis include the abnormal regulation of angiogenesis (increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 and of angiopoietin-2), protein C and S deficiencies and obesity.\n\n【9】In the acute phase, lipodermatosclerosis can resemble cellulitis. However, the failure to improve with antibiotics and surrounding stasis changes can help accurately identify the diagnosis. In the chronic phase, sclerosis in the dermis and subcutis lead to well-demarcated induration that imparts an ‘inverted wine bottle’ appearance to the affected leg(s).\n\n【10】ii. In acute lipodermatosclerosis, there are inflammatory infiltrates in the septa around fat lobules, evidence of capillary congestion and thrombosis and hemosiderin deposition. In chronic lesions, the inflammatory component is reduced and there is marked septal sclerosis and lipomembranous changes, which consists of thickened membranes with cyst formation in papillary configurations. Although lipomembranous changes are characteristic of lipodermatosclerosis, they can also be observed in panniculitis seen in the setting of lupus and dermatomyositis, erythema nodosum and diabetic dermopathy.\n\n【11】iii. The mainstays of therapy for lipodermatosclerosis are leg elevation and compression therapy.

He works as a landscaper and states that no one else at work has a similar-appearing rash. The patient reports noticing the lesion on his upper trunk approximately 4 days ago when he also experienced fatigue, a low-grade fever, and chills. On examination, there are two expanding erythematous-to-violaceous plaques on the left lateral trunk with central clearing and a brightly erythematous border 通用删除7(英):<u>( 64 )</u>.\n\n【4】i. What are these lesions called, and what is the aetiology?\n\n【5】ii. What diagnostic tests can be performed, and what are their limitations?\n\n【6】iii. What is the cutaneous finding of this disease in its chronic form?\n\n【7】iv. What are the treatment options?\n\n【8】Answer 64\n\n【9】i. Lyme disease is a tick-borne, multisystem disease that is caused by infection with Borrelia species of spirochetes. In the United States, most cases of Lyme disease are caused by Borrelia burgdorferi , whereas B. garinii and B. afzelii are the predominant etiologic organisms seen in Europe. The Ixodes tick acts as the vector for disease transmission by feeding on an infected host (usually white-footed mice and white-tailed deer) and transmitting the bacteria to humans through its saliva.\n\n【10】The patient’s lesions are a classic cutaneous manifestation of early-localized Lyme disease, called erythema migrans. It is an annular erythematous rash with central clearing or a bull’s-eye appearance that develops at the site of the tick bite within 1–2 weeks. Systemic manifestations of early Lyme disease are flu-like symptoms such as fever, fatigue, arthralgias, myalgias and lymphadenopathy. In up to 25% of patients there may be numerous lesions of erythema migrans which occur as a result of multiple tick bites, or in disseminated disease due to lymphatic spread or spirochetemia. In chronic Lyme disease, patients develop monoarticular or oligoarticular arthritis, neurological manifestations such as Bell’s palsy and/or cardiac complications such as atrioventricular block.\n\n【11】ii. The diagnosis of Lyme disease does not require a history of tick bite. Testing can be performed with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or Western blot analysis, but antibodies often remain for months or years after infection, and therefore cannot distinguish between active and past infection. Skin biopsy and culture can also be performed but is not routinely done. Histologically, the presence of an infiltrate composed of eosinophils and plasma cells within the dermis supports the diagnosis, but is not a specific finding to erythema migrans.\n\n【12】iii. Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (ACA), also known as Herxheimer disease, is a cutaneous manifestation of chronic Lyme disease. It is most commonly associated with Lyme disease through infection with B. afzelii, and therefore seen in higher frequency (up to 10%) in people with Lyme disease in Europe than in the United States. It is characterized by an initial presentation of erythematous and violaceous nodules and plaques on acral surfaces, any time between 6 months and 8 years after infection. In the late stage of ACA, the skin becomes atrophic, shiny and wrinkled, with prominent blood vessels. It can also lead to dyspigmentation, pain and pruritus.\n\n【13】iv. Treatment of Lyme disease includes early removal of the tick, and initiation of antibiotics. In early localized or mild disseminated disease, the first-line therapy is doxycycline for 2–4 weeks of therapy. Children and pregnant women should be treated with amoxicillin as an alternative agent. In severe disseminated disease or chronic Lyme disease with significant neurologic or cardiac complications, first-line therapy is intravenous ceftriaxone for 2–4 weeks.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:32:42", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:33:38", "cost": 56.254}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:45:56", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:33:37", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:32:41"}

He has had fatigue and weight loss. He now presents with fever, tachypnea, and hypoxemia. It is likely that he is infected with HIV, and has P jiroveci pneumonia. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infects the helper T cells of the immune system, which are defined by the presence of the cell-signaling protein CD4, and causes a decline in both their number and their effectiveness. This decline in functional helper T cells disables the cell-mediated arm of the immune system and leaves the body vulnerable to infection from multiple opportunistic organisms. This advanced stage of the HIV infection, in which such opportunistic infections occur, is known as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).\n\n【19】Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly known as P carinii ) pneumonia is an AIDS-defining illness in someone infected with HIV. P jiroveci is a fungus that may colonize many people, but typically causes disease only in those with profound immune deficiencies, such as AIDS infections or cancers treated with chemotherapy. P jiroveci 删除换行1: pneumonia usually presents with nonproductive cough, fever, and dyspnea that worsens over a few days to a few weeks. Patients usually are found to be febrile, tachypneic, and hypoxic, although their lung examination may be unremarkable (other than tachypnea). The presence of a bilateral interstitial infiltrate on chest x-ray, often described as having a ground-glass appearance, is classic for P jiroveci pneumonia. The identification of the organism in sputum, either spontaneously produced or induced, is diagnostic, but treatment is usually started prior to definitive diagnosis in those with a classic clinical picture.\n\n【20】As P jiroveci pneumonia occurs after the CD4 count has markedly reduced, patients often will have symptoms and signs of other AIDS-related complications as well. It is common to see oral or esophageal candidiasis, diarrhea, Kaposi sarcoma, wasting syndrome, and other complications in a patient presenting with P jiroveci pneumonia. Although it presents in the setting of advanced disease, P jiroveci pneumonia remains a common presenting illness in those who did not know that they were infected with HIV and is a frequent initial opportunistic infection in those with known HIV disease. The incidence of P jiroveci pneumonia is decreasing in the United States with more widespread awareness of HIV disease, broader usage of antiretroviral therapy, and prophylactic use of TMP-SMX in patients with CD4 count of less than 200 cells/µL.\n\n【21】### APPROACH TO:  \nHIV and AIDS\n\n【22】### DEFINITIONS\n\n【23】ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY SYNDROME (AIDS): This advanced stage of the HIV infection, in which such opportunistic infections occur with specific criteria for its designation.\n\n【24】HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV): A retrovirus that infects the helper T cells of the immune system, which are defined by the presence of the cell-signaling protein CD4, and causes a decline in both their number and their effectiveness.\n\n【25】### CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【26】#### Epidemiology\n\n【27】Over 33 million people in the world are living with HIV infection. It is estimated that more than 2 million people die from AIDS every year, with a disproportionate share of the deaths occurring in sub-Saharan Africa. HIV disease is caused by the human retroviruses, HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is more common worldwide, whereas HIV-2 has been reported in western Africa, Europe, South America, and Canada.\n\n【28】In the United States, 1.2 million people are estimated to be infected with HIV, with approximately 25% unaware of their infection . The highest prevalence of HIV occurs in men who have sex with other men and in IV drug users, although the occurrence in heterosexual sexual contact is increasing. African Americans are disproportionately affected with infection, both in total numbers of cases and in development of new infections.\n\n【29】#### Transmission\n\n【30】HIV is transmitted from person to person through contact with infected blood and body fluids . Sexual contact is the most common mechanism of transmission and, while anal intercourse has the highest rate of transmission, HIV can be acquired through vaginal and oral intercourse as well. The risk of HIV transmission is also increased by the presence of genital or anal lesions caused by other sexually transmitted diseases, such as gonorrhea and genital herpes. The risk of transmission can be reduced by the proper and consistent use of latex condoms (either male or female condoms). Because HIV can pass through lambskin condoms, these are not recommended. Circumcision has also been shown to decrease the rate of HIV transmission.\n\n【31】Because of the large amount of undiagnosed HIV infections, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2006 expanded screening recommendations, which are summarized in Table 45–1 .\n删除4：<u>Table 45–1 • CDC HIV SCREENING RECOMMENDATIONS</u>\n\n【32】Sharing needles by IV drug users is the second most common source of transmission of HIV. Vertical transmission from an infected woman to her baby has been found to occur during pregnancy, during the process of delivery of a baby, and from breast-feeding. Blood and blood-product transfusions have been linked to infection, although the routine screening of donor blood for HIV now makes this an extremely rare event.\n\n【33】Health-care workers have been infected with HIV through accidental punctures with needles used on HIV-infected patients. There is also a risk of infection by infected blood entering through open skin wounds or mucous membranes. The risk of transmission to health-care workers is low and is related to the viral load of the patient, the amount of blood to which the worker is exposed, and the depth of the inoculum. Postexposure risk of developing HIV infection can be reduced by immediate and careful cleaning of the exposure/puncture site along with postexposure prophylactic (PEP) treatment with antiretroviral therapy. Postexposure prophylaxis should ideally be started within 2 hours after the exposure and should only be used when exposure to HIV-contaminated blood is likely. Although animal models limit the usefulness of PEP to 36 hours, there is no defined time limit before starting medications. The currently recommended length of PEP is 4 weeks.\n\n【34】HIV has been measured in small amounts in saliva and tears of HIV-infected patients, but no cases of transmission based on exposure to these have been documented. Transmission has been reported to occur in bite wounds from infected individuals, but only when significant tissue damage and bleeding has occurred. Measurable amounts of HIV have not been found in sweat. No case of HIV has been documented to have occurred via an insect vector.\n\n【35】#### Primary Infection\n\n【36】Following initial exposure to HIV, some patients will complain of nonspecific symptoms, such as low-grade fever, fatigue, sore throat, or myalgias. This illness typically occurs 6 to 8 weeks following the infection and is self-limited. The primary infection is also known as acute seroconversion syndrome, as the symptoms are thought to be related to the development of antibodies to the virus.\n\n【37】Following the resolution of the primary infection symptoms (if any occur), there is a period of clinical latency. During this time, most infected persons are asymptomatic, although some may have lymphadenopathy. This period can last from 6 months to 10 years following the transmission of the virus. However, while the patient is asymptomatic during this period, a relentless decline in helper T-cell number and immune function usually occurs in the untreated patient, with the result that many patients initially present with profound immunodeficiency and opportunistic infections.\n\n【38】#### Clinical Categorization of HIV/AIDS Infections\n\n【39】The CDC defines four clinical stages for adults aged >13.\n\n【40】Stage 1. CD4 cell count >500 cells/µL or percentage of total lymphocytes >29\n\n【41】Stage 2. CD4 cell count of 200 to 499 cells/µL or percentage between 14 and 28\n\n【42】Stage 3. (AIDS) CD4 cell count <200 cells/µL or percentage <14 and documentation of AIDS-defining condition ( Tables 45–2 and 45–3 删除换行4: Stage 4. Unknown laboratory parameters with an AIDS-defining condition\n删除4：<u>Table 45–3 • EXAMPLES OF AIDS-DEFINING CONDITIONS</u>\n\n【43】For classification purposes, a patient’s HIV is defined by the highest clinical stage in which the patient has ever qualified .\n\n【44】#### Diagnostic Evaluation\n\n【45】The standard screening test for HIV infection is the detection of HIV antibodies using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Samples that are repeatedly positive on ELISA testing must be confirmed by Western blot testing . The Western blot test is an electrophoresis that detects antibodies to HIV antigens of specific molecular weights.\n\n【46】When HIV is diagnosed, a complete history and physical examination should be performed. Emphasis should be placed on identifying comorbid conditions, determining the presence of AIDS-defining conditions, reducing risky behaviors, and assisting with coping strategies. HIV is reportable to local health authorities, but partner notification laws vary by state , so it is important to know the local regulations.\n\n【47】Before instituting therapy, laboratory testing should include HIV genotype testing to identify strains that may be resistant to therapy. HIV RNA levels can help to assess disease activity. CD4 lymphocyte counts should be measured at baseline and, generally, every 3 to 6 months thereafter to monitor for disease staging, progression, and the risk of complications. A complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel, and urinalysis should be performed at baseline and periodically thereafter to monitor for complications of HIV and of the medications that are used in treatment. Serology for toxoplasmosis and cytomegalovirus should also be obtained to identify organisms at risk for reactivation following immunosuppression.\n\n【48】Screening for other sexually transmitted diseases (syphilis, hepatitis B and C, gonorrhea, chlamydia) should be performed initially and repeated, if needed, because of any ongoing risks identified. Hepatitis B and A vaccination should be offered to those who lack immunity. A purified protein derivative (PPD) test should be done, and if initially negative, repeated annually. However, a PPD may be falsely negative if the patient is very immunosuppressed or very ill. Women should have regular Papanicolaou (Pap) smears to evaluate for cervical dysplasia or cancer.\n\n【49】#### Late Disease\n\n【50】HIV and the opportunistic infections it allows affect every organ system in the body. Some infections, such as tuberculosis and pneumococcal pneumonia, also affect healthy people but are greatly increased in incidence and severity in the presence of HIV. Many mildly pathologic organisms, such as Candida , cause unusual, severe infections in parts of the body, such as the esophagus and lungs, which they would rarely if ever affect without coinfection with HIV. Moreover, some AIDS-defining conditions, such as Kaposi sarcoma, can occur at normal T-cell counts while other infections, such as cytomegalovirus retinitis and cryptococcal meningitis, are only seen in the presence of extreme immunodeficiency and very low T-cell counts. Many cancers are common in HIV-positive people, some of which, such as cervical carcinoma, are found in the non–HIV-infected population while others, such as primary CNS lymphoma, are extremely rare outside of the HIV infected. Moreover, HIV infection damages the body directly and leads to such conditions as HIV-related dementia and HIV-associated nephropathy. Without antiretroviral therapy, AIDS is a universally fatal disease.\n\n【51】#### Treatment\n\n【52】Because of the complexity of treatment regimens and frequently changing treatment guidelines, patients with HIV/AIDS should be referred, in almost all cases, to a physician with expertise in treating these conditions . In general, antiretroviral therapy is used in patients who have AIDS (by laboratory or clinical criteria), who have symptoms of disease, or who are pregnant (to reduce the risk of vertical transmission). Updated guidelines on HIV/AIDS treatment and monitoring can be obtained by going to 删除9：<u>http://www.aidsinfo.nih.gov</u> .\n\n【53】Prophylactic treatments to reduce the risk of infection are also important in immunosuppressed patients. HIV patients should receive annual influenza vaccination and should be offered pneumococcal vaccination (preferably before the CD4 count falls to less than 200 cells/µL). Live virus vaccines are contraindicated in both HIV patients and their close (household) contacts . Prophylaxis against P jiroveci pneumonia should be instituted using TMP-SMX when the CD4 count falls to less than 200 cells/µL or if there is a history of oropharyngeal candidiasis. Mycobacterium avium– intracellulare complex prophylaxis, using azithromycin or clarithromycin, is recommended if the CD4 count falls to less than 50 cells/µL.\n\n【54】###", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【43】For classification purposes,", "content": "【0】Case Files: Family Medicine, Third Edition  \n\n【1】### CASE 45\n\n【2】A 39-year-old homeless man presents to the emergency department (ED) for cough and fever.

The identification of the organism in sputum, either spontaneously produced or induced, is diagnostic, but treatment is usually started prior to definitive diagnosis in those with a classic clinical picture.\n\n【20】As P jiroveci pneumonia occurs after the CD4 count has markedly reduced, patients often will have symptoms and signs of other AIDS-related complications as well. It is common to see oral or esophageal candidiasis, diarrhea, Kaposi sarcoma, wasting syndrome, and other complications in a patient presenting with P jiroveci pneumonia. Although it presents in the setting of advanced disease, P jiroveci pneumonia remains a common presenting illness in those who did not know that they were infected with HIV and is a frequent initial opportunistic infection in those with known HIV disease. The incidence of P jiroveci pneumonia is decreasing in the United States with more widespread awareness of HIV disease, broader usage of antiretroviral therapy, and prophylactic use of TMP-SMX in patients with CD4 count of less than 200 cells/µL.\n\n【21】### APPROACH TO:  \nHIV and AIDS\n\n【22】### DEFINITIONS\n\n【23】ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY SYNDROME (AIDS): This advanced stage of the HIV infection, in which such opportunistic infections occur with specific criteria for its designation.\n\n【24】HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV): A retrovirus that infects the helper T cells of the immune system, which are defined by the presence of the cell-signaling protein CD4, and causes a decline in both their number and their effectiveness.\n\n【25】### CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【26】#### Epidemiology\n\n【27】Over 33 million people in the world are living with HIV infection. It is estimated that more than 2 million people die from AIDS every year, with a disproportionate share of the deaths occurring in sub-Saharan Africa. HIV disease is caused by the human retroviruses, HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is more common worldwide, whereas HIV-2 has been reported in western Africa, Europe, South America, and Canada.\n\n【28】In the United States, 1.2 million people are estimated to be infected with HIV, with approximately 25% unaware of their infection . The highest prevalence of HIV occurs in men who have sex with other men and in IV drug users, although the occurrence in heterosexual sexual contact is increasing. African Americans are disproportionately affected with infection, both in total numbers of cases and in development of new infections.\n\n【29】#### Transmission\n\n【30】HIV is transmitted from person to person through contact with infected blood and body fluids . Sexual contact is the most common mechanism of transmission and, while anal intercourse has the highest rate of transmission, HIV can be acquired through vaginal and oral intercourse as well. The risk of HIV transmission is also increased by the presence of genital or anal lesions caused by other sexually transmitted diseases, such as gonorrhea and genital herpes. The risk of transmission can be reduced by the proper and consistent use of latex condoms (either male or female condoms). Because HIV can pass through lambskin condoms, these are not recommended. Circumcision has also been shown to decrease the rate of HIV transmission.\n\n【31】Because of the large amount of undiagnosed HIV infections, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2006 expanded screening recommendations, which are summarized in Table 45–1 .\n删除4：<u>Table 45–1 • CDC HIV SCREENING RECOMMENDATIONS</u>\n\n【32】Sharing needles by IV drug users is the second most common source of transmission of HIV. Vertical transmission from an infected woman to her baby has been found to occur during pregnancy, during the process of delivery of a baby, and from breast-feeding. Blood and blood-product transfusions have been linked to infection, although the routine screening of donor blood for HIV now makes this an extremely rare event.\n\n【33】Health-care workers have been infected with HIV through accidental punctures with needles used on HIV-infected patients. There is also a risk of infection by infected blood entering through open skin wounds or mucous membranes. The risk of transmission to health-care workers is low and is related to the viral load of the patient, the amount of blood to which the worker is exposed, and the depth of the inoculum. Postexposure risk of developing HIV infection can be reduced by immediate and careful cleaning of the exposure/puncture site along with postexposure prophylactic (PEP) treatment with antiretroviral therapy. Postexposure prophylaxis should ideally be started within 2 hours after the exposure and should only be used when exposure to HIV-contaminated blood is likely. Although animal models limit the usefulness of PEP to 36 hours, there is no defined time limit before starting medications. The currently recommended length of PEP is 4 weeks.\n\n【34】HIV has been measured in small amounts in saliva and tears of HIV-infected patients, but no cases of transmission based on exposure to these have been documented. Transmission has been reported to occur in bite wounds from infected individuals, but only when significant tissue damage and bleeding has occurred. Measurable amounts of HIV have not been found in sweat. No case of HIV has been documented to have occurred via an insect vector.\n\n【35】#### Primary Infection\n\n【36】Following initial exposure to HIV, some patients will complain of nonspecific symptoms, such as low-grade fever, fatigue, sore throat, or myalgias. This illness typically occurs 6 to 8 weeks following the infection and is self-limited. The primary infection is also known as acute seroconversion syndrome, as the symptoms are thought to be related to the development of antibodies to the virus.\n\n【37】Following the resolution of the primary infection symptoms (if any occur), there is a period of clinical latency. During this time, most infected persons are asymptomatic, although some may have lymphadenopathy. This period can last from 6 months to 10 years following the transmission of the virus. However, while the patient is asymptomatic during this period, a relentless decline in helper T-cell number and immune function usually occurs in the untreated patient, with the result that many patients initially present with profound immunodeficiency and opportunistic infections.\n\n【38】#### Clinical Categorization of HIV/AIDS Infections\n\n【39】The CDC defines four clinical stages for adults aged >13.\n\n【40】Stage 1. CD4 cell count >500 cells/µL or percentage of total lymphocytes >29\n\n【41】Stage 2. CD4 cell count of 200 to 499 cells/µL or percentage between 14 and 28\n\n【42】Stage 3. (AIDS) CD4 cell count <200 cells/µL or percentage <14 and documentation of AIDS-defining condition ( Tables 45–2 and 45–3 删除换行4: Stage 4. Unknown laboratory parameters with an AIDS-defining condition\n删除4：<u>Table 45–3 • EXAMPLES OF AIDS-DEFINING CONDITIONS</u>\n\n【43】For classification purposes, a patient’s HIV is defined by the highest clinical stage in which the patient has ever qualified .\n\n【44】#### Diagnostic Evaluation\n\n【45】The standard screening test for HIV infection is the detection of HIV antibodies using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Samples that are repeatedly positive on ELISA testing must be confirmed by Western blot testing . The Western blot test is an electrophoresis that detects antibodies to HIV antigens of specific molecular weights.\n\n【46】When HIV is diagnosed, a complete history and physical examination should be performed. Emphasis should be placed on identifying comorbid conditions, determining the presence of AIDS-defining conditions, reducing risky behaviors, and assisting with coping strategies. HIV is reportable to local health authorities, but partner notification laws vary by state , so it is important to know the local regulations.\n\n【47】Before instituting therapy, laboratory testing should include HIV genotype testing to identify strains that may be resistant to therapy. HIV RNA levels can help to assess disease activity. CD4 lymphocyte counts should be measured at baseline and, generally, every 3 to 6 months thereafter to monitor for disease staging, progression, and the risk of complications. A complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel, and urinalysis should be performed at baseline and periodically thereafter to monitor for complications of HIV and of the medications that are used in treatment. Serology for toxoplasmosis and cytomegalovirus should also be obtained to identify organisms at risk for reactivation following immunosuppression.\n\n【48】Screening for other sexually transmitted diseases (syphilis, hepatitis B and C, gonorrhea, chlamydia) should be performed initially and repeated, if needed, because of any ongoing risks identified. Hepatitis B and A vaccination should be offered to those who lack immunity. A purified protein derivative (PPD) test should be done, and if initially negative, repeated annually. However, a PPD may be falsely negative if the patient is very immunosuppressed or very ill. Women should have regular Papanicolaou (Pap) smears to evaluate for cervical dysplasia or cancer.\n\n【49】#### Late Disease\n\n【50】HIV and the opportunistic infections it allows affect every organ system in the body. Some infections, such as tuberculosis and pneumococcal pneumonia, also affect healthy people but are greatly increased in incidence and severity in the presence of HIV. Many mildly pathologic organisms, such as Candida , cause unusual, severe infections in parts of the body, such as the esophagus and lungs, which they would rarely if ever affect without coinfection with HIV. Moreover, some AIDS-defining conditions, such as Kaposi sarcoma, can occur at normal T-cell counts while other infections, such as cytomegalovirus retinitis and cryptococcal meningitis, are only seen in the presence of extreme immunodeficiency and very low T-cell counts. Many cancers are common in HIV-positive people, some of which, such as cervical carcinoma, are found in the non–HIV-infected population while others, such as primary CNS lymphoma, are extremely rare outside of the HIV infected. Moreover, HIV infection damages the body directly and leads to such conditions as HIV-related dementia and HIV-associated nephropathy. Without antiretroviral therapy, AIDS is a universally fatal disease.\n\n【51】#### Treatment\n\n【52】Because of the complexity of treatment regimens and frequently changing treatment guidelines, patients with HIV/AIDS should be referred, in almost all cases, to a physician with expertise in treating these conditions . In general, antiretroviral therapy is used in patients who have AIDS (by laboratory or clinical criteria), who have symptoms of disease, or who are pregnant (to reduce the risk of vertical transmission). Updated guidelines on HIV/AIDS treatment and monitoring can be obtained by going to 删除9：<u>http://www.aidsinfo.nih.gov</u> .\n\n【53】Prophylactic treatments to reduce the risk of infection are also important in immunosuppressed patients. HIV patients should receive annual influenza vaccination and should be offered pneumococcal vaccination (preferably before the CD4 count falls to less than 200 cells/µL). Live virus vaccines are contraindicated in both HIV patients and their close (household) contacts . Prophylaxis against P jiroveci pneumonia should be instituted using TMP-SMX when the CD4 count falls to less than 200 cells/µL or if there is a history of oropharyngeal candidiasis. Mycobacterium avium– intracellulare complex prophylaxis, using azithromycin or clarithromycin, is recommended if the CD4 count falls to less than 50 cells/µL.\n\n【54】###", "index": 11384, "show": true, "start": 11384, "end": 11416, "province": ["格式规范性", "多余换行"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/09/14 11:46:59", "endTime": "2024/09/14 11:48:12", "cost": 73.144}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:45:56", "update_time": "2024-09-13 19:48:13", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 19:46:59"}

Early recognition of each disease is important due to the complex interplay between the two. The severity of heart disease and fatty liver disease is worse in patients who have both disease states, and there is a higher prevalence of fatty liver disease in patients with heart failure compared with the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 \\]</u>. One study demonstrated that patients with comorbid heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) were younger, had higher body mass indexes (BMIs), and had more left ventricular changes compared to patients with normal liver morphology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 \\]</u>. Additionally, patients with liver disease and heart failure are more likely to have a poorer prognosis and are at higher risk when undergoing cardiac surgeries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 26 \\]</u>. Both pharmacological and nonpharmacological management techniques are needed to prevent the more severe disease progression that can be seen in patients with these two comorbidities.\n\n【2】### 15.4.1 Pharmacologic Management\n\n【3】There are a few general principles of drug metabolism that are important to consider when treating co-occurring liver disease and heart failure. The efficiency of hepatic metabolism is multifactorial, comprised of the functionality of the hepatocytes themselves, the blood supply to the liver, and the availability of plasma proteins capable of binding drugs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 27 \\]</u>. Therefore, there are multiple mechanisms by which disease processes can impair hepatic metabolism. Liver function test abnormalities do not always correspond with alterations in metabolism, making it difficult to predict to what degree drug metabolism will be affected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 27 \\]</u>. However, it has generally been found that mild to moderate liver disease does not impair metabolism significantly, and it is not until a patient is cirrhotic that medication doses need to be adjusted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 27 \\]</u>. In cirrhosis, shunting of blood reduces drug elimination during the first pass effect and cytochrome activity can be decreased; both can lead to increased serum concentrations of drugs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 27 \\]</u>. Heart failure can additionally damage the liver due to venous congestion and decreased perfusion, which ultimately causes liver hypoxia and impacts hepatic metabolism of drugs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 27 \\]</u>. Specific medication considerations as they pertain to liver disease and heart failure treatment will be discussed further below.\n\n【4】#### 15.4.1.1 Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)\n\n【5】There are currently no approved medications specifically for the treatment of NAFLD. High-dose vitamin E can be used in more advanced fibrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 28 \\]</u>. There are several other current or emerging drug therapies that are being studied for use in NAFLD. Diabetes medications, including pioglitazone, metformin, GLP1 agonists, DPP-4 inhibitors, and SGLT2 inhibitors, are all being studied due to observed positive benefits in liver fibrosis or steatosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 28 , 29 \\]</u>. In patients with comorbid heart failure, SGLT2 inhibitors could have the added benefit of reducing heart failure-associated risks. Conversely, though pioglitazone shows promise in treating NAFLD patients, it would be contraindicated in those with comorbid heart failure due to its risks of swelling and heart failure exacerbation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 29 \\]</u>. There is additionally early research to suggest that use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) could slow progression of hepatic fibrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 29 \\]</u>, which would be advantageous in heart failure patients given that treatment with ACE inhibitors or ARBs is already part of the standard of care.\n\n【6】#### 15.4.1.2 Heart Failure\n\n【7】The standard therapeutic agents used to treat heart failure with reduced ejection fraction include ACE inhibitors, ARBs, ARNIs, beta blockers, diuretics, SGLT2is, and aldosterone antagonists. Specific considerations for each will be discussed separately below.\n\n【8】##### ACE Inhibitors\n\n【9】ACE inhibitors are largely excreted by the kidneys and are not expected to be affected much by hepatic dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 26 \\]</u>. However, many are prodrugs which require metabolism in the liver to form active metabolites. These include enalapril, ramipril, fosinopril, trandolapril, quinapril, benazepril, and moexipril 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 26 , 27 \\]</u>. Hepatic impairment may decrease the bioavailability of the active metabolite and increase the prodrug concentration in the blood stream. Therefore, it is advised to start at the initial dose but titrate slowly in cirrhotic patients when administering the aforementioned prodrugs, with the exception of moexipril and trandolapril which require a dose reduction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 27 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】##### ARBs\n\n【11】Candesartan, losartan, and valsartan are currently the three ARBs with an approved indication for use in heart failure patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 30 \\]</u>. Of these, candesartan and losartan are both prodrugs and require a lower starting dose in cirrhosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 , 26 \\]</u>. Telmisartan also requires a lower starting dose and slower titration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 27 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】##### ARNIs\n\n【13】Sacubitril/valsartan is now recommended in place of ACEs or ARBs for all HFrEF patients who can tolerate it due to its superior ability to reduce hospitalizations and mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 31 \\]</u>. It requires a dose reduction for patients with moderate liver disease and is contraindicated for those with severe more advanced liver disease.\n\n【14】##### Beta Blockers\n\n【15】Bisoprolol, metoprolol succinate, and carvedilol are the three FDA-approved beta blockers for heart failure treatment. All of these are lipophilic beta blockers, which are predominantly metabolized by the liver and require a dose reduction in the setting of cirrhosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 26 , 27 \\]</u>. Other commonly used lipophilic beta blockers requiring dose reduction include propranolol, timolol, and nebivolol 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 26 , 27 \\]</u>. Nonselective beta blockers (such as nadolol, propranolol, timolol, and carvedilol) can further be of benefit in liver disease patients as the preferred treatment for portal hypertension and prevention of variceal bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 32 \\]</u>. There have been concerns raised about the use of nonselective beta blockers in cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites due to concerns for increased mortality. However, current evidence still supports their use in heart failure and in cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension, but it is recommended to start at a very low dose and titrate slowly, every 1–2 weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 32 \\]</u>. Close monitoring to watch for signs of decreased organ perfusion and hypotension is advised 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 32 \\]</u>. Beta blockers may need to be temporarily discontinued in heart failure patients in the setting of ischemic hepatitis, as treatment focuses on restoration of blood flow to the liver typically through removal of negative inotropes and blood pressure reducing medications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】##### Diuretics\n\n【17】Use of diuretics in heart failure can be mutually beneficial in liver diseases by improving jaundice, ascites, and liver congestion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. Thiazide diuretics can be utilized in mild heart failure, though loop diuretics are typically the mainstay of therapy in heart failure patients. Thiazide diuretics may also be used for ascites management. Diuretics are typically excreted renally so there is no dose reduction in advanced liver disease. However, dehydration can cause hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhosis, so close monitoring of volume status is required to avoid diuretic-induced dehydration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 27 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】##### SGLT2 Inhibitors\n\n【19】The most recent heart failure guidelines have a new addition of SGLT2 inhibitors to the treatment regimen of patients with symptomatic chronic heart failure, even if they do not have comorbid diabetes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 31 \\]</u>. There are no dose adjustments required for patients with comorbid liver disease, and in fact SGLT2 inhibitors show promise in improving liver fibrosis or steatosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 28 , 29 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】##### Aldosterone Antagonists\n\n【21】Spironolactone and eplerenone are common adjunct therapies in heart failure, especially in diuretic-resistant patients. Spironolactone is also highly effective for the treatment of ascites in liver disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 33 \\]</u>. However, the doses for these two conditions may differ. Adjunct therapy in heart failure often involves spironolactone doses of 25–50 mg daily, whereas ascites treatment may require up to 400 mg daily for adequate diuresis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 33 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】##### Lipid-Lowering Agents\n\n【23】Patients with heart failure as well as liver disease commonly have comorbid hyperlipidemia. Pharmacological treatment with statins and ezetimibe is recommended to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in these patients, though there is no known benefit in improving liver disease itself 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 29 \\]</u>. However, both classes of medications are contraindicated in severe hepatic disease and dose reduction may be required for more mild hepatic impairment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 27 \\]</u>. Although not typically first-line agents, fibric acid derivatives may also commonly be used for adjunct lipid lowering therapy, but again would be contraindicated in severe liver disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 27 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】##### Anticoagulant/Antiplatelet Therapy\n\n【25】Anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy may be indicated in many patients with heart failure due to common comorbidities such as atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, or prior stroke. However, both heart failure and hepatic dysfunction are associated with elevated prothrombin levels leading to increased clotting times 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. Furthermore, patients with cirrhosis have an increased risk of hemorrhage due to the high prevalence of esophageal varices 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Therefore, use of anticoagulants in these patients can be controversial, particularly with newer agents such as rivaroxaban or apixaban which are contraindicated in more advanced hepatic disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. There is also concern for possible liver toxicity in all newer oral anticoagulants 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Warfarin is still commonly used in patients with heart failure and hepatic dysfunction requiring anticoagulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u> though frequent INR monitoring is advised.\n\n【26】#### 15.4.1.3 Congestive Hepatopathy\n\n【27】The primary treatment of congestive hepatopathy involves correcting the underlying heart disease which in turn alleviates the hepatic congestion. It is predominantly treated with diuretics to reduce fluid overload, which corrects the associated liver congestion, ascites, and jaundice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. ACE inhibitors and B blockers are also recommended as they are indicated in the treatment of symptomatic heart failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】#### 15.4.1.4 Cardiogenic Ischemic Hepatitis\n\n【29】Pharmacological management of cardiogenic ischemic hepatitis typically involves removing medications that contribute to decreased perfusion, predominantly negative inotropes such as B blockers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Patients may also require the use of positive inotropes or vasopressors to return perfusion to the liver, such as milrinone or digoxin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 19 \\]</u>. Inotropic and vasopressor medications can generally be used without dose adjustment in the setting of hepatic impairment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 27 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】#### 15.4.1.5 Post-Liver Transplant\n\n【31】Immunosuppressive therapies used after liver transplantation may have cardiac side effects. Tacrolimus has been shown to cause significant myocardial hypertrophy in some patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Corticosteroids such as prednisone can cause edema and heart failure exacerbations. On the other hand, cyclosporine, sirolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil do not appear to cause significant cardiac issues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【32】### 15.4.2 Nonpharmacologic Management\n\n【33】#### 15.4.2.1 Lifestyle Modifications\n\n【34】Lifestyle modifications are currently the mainstay of NAFLD. These modifications include diet, weight loss, exercise, smoking cessation, and alcohol reduction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 28 , 29 \\]</u>. Given that fatty liver disease tends to have many of the same risk factors as heart failure, including type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and metabolic syndrome, the lifestyle modifications aimed at reducing liver disease tend to improve heart failure, as well 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 29 \\]</u>.\n\n【35】##### Diet\n\n【36】Current evidence suggests that the Mediterranean diet or a low-glycemic index diet containing high fiber, few saturated fats, and few simple sugars are the best diets for improving hepatic steatosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 28 , 29 \\]</u>. The Mediterranean diet has also repeatedly been shown to improve cardiovascular outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 34 \\]</u>.\n\n【37】##### Exercise\n\n【38】Exercise regimens should include 150 min weekly of resistance training and moderate to high intensity aerobic exercise. This not only improves hepatic steatosis but also assists with weight loss, reduces insulin resistance, and improves lipid profiles, all of which improve cardiovascular outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 28 , 29 \\]</u>. Aerobic exercise also improves exercise tolerance in heart failure patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 \\]</u>.\n\n【39】##### Weight Loss\n\n【40】Patients with fatty liver disease are typically advised to lose 5–10% of total body weight to see improvements in NAFLD. There are times even more weight loss may be advised based on the degree of aminotransferase elevation or severity of histological change 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 28 , 29 \\]</u>. Weight loss can help prevent the development of heart failure or improve exercise tolerance and reduce symptoms in those with preexisting heart failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 , 35 \\]</u>. However, in patients with preexisting heart failure, there is a well-established obesity paradox in which obesity seems to provide a protective mechanism on heart failure outcomes. Obese patients have better prognoses and higher survival rates than those heart failure patients who lose weight or have lower BMI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 29 , 35 \\]</u>. There are currently unclear guidelines about weight loss recommendations for heart failure patients, which poses a challenge when trying to advise those with comorbid fatty liver disease. More research is needed in this area. In the interim, for those patients with preexisting heart failure, it is best to focus on dietary improvements rather than a specific weight reduction goal itself. If patients are more severely obese, a modest amount of weight reduction may be advisable for the sake of reducing heart failure-associated symptoms and improving quality of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 35 \\]</u>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 13:53:24", "endTime": "2024/09/14 13:53:45", "cost": 20.501}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:45:56", "update_time": "2024-09-13 21:53:45", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 21:53:24"}

He also notes changes in vision associated with the headaches. Physical examination shows a healing ecchymotic lesion on the right forearm, papilledema in the left eye, a right-sided pronator drift, and weakness of the right arm. The diagnosis of an intracranial hemorrhage is confirmed with CT of the head. Which of the following cancers is most likely to have resulted in this patient’s presentation?\n\n【1】> (A) Angiosarcoma\n\n【2】> (B) Basal cell carcinoma\n\n【3】> (C) Colorectal carcinoma\n\n【4】> (D) Melanoma\n\n【5】> (E) Prostate cancer\n\n【6】 Answer: The correct answer is D . Intracranial metastases represent nearly half of all brain tumors, yet only 15% of tumors metastasize to the brain. Intracranial hemorrhages are a recognized but relatively uncommon complication of brain tumors and can result in intraparenchymal, subarachnoid, subdural, and epidural hematomas. Focal neurologic signs are frequently evident and are due to pressure exerted on the brain parenchyma. Because melanoma is a relatively frequent source of metastatic lesions to the brain (although less common than breast or lung carcinoma) and demonstrates a tendency to hemorrhage, melanoma is the correct answer in this case.  \n\n【7】Answer A is incorrect . Angiosarcomas are malignant endothelial neoplasms that resemble hemangiomas. Although these tumors may bleed, angiosarcomas rarely metastasize, and only a few case reports exist of hemorrhage of cerebral metastasis from angiosarcoma.  \n\n【8】Answer B is incorrect . Some cancers rarely metastasize to the brain; these include carcinomas of the oropharynx, esophagus, and prostate, as well as nonmelanoma skin cancers.  \n\n【9】Answer C is incorrect . Colorectal carcinoma does metastasize to the brain (though less frequently than melanoma) but does not typically result in intracranial hemorrhage. Since colorectal carcinoma is less likely than melanoma to result in brain metastases and is not as likely to hemorrhage, melanoma is a better answer.  \n\n【10】Answer E is incorrect . Carcinoma of the prostate almost never results in metastatic brain disease. Prostate cancer can cause malignant spinal cord compression by metastasizing to the vertebra.

LCH is characterized by the pathologic proliferation and excessive accumulation in a variety of organs with Langerhans cells that normally derived from epidermal and mucosal dendritic cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. The disease can be localized in a single organ or multi-organs involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】LCH has traditionally been described as four separate syndromes with different clinical severity : Hashimoto-Pritzker disease , Eosinophilic granuloma, Hand-Schüller-Christian disease and Letterer-Siwe disease . Currently, LCH patients are generally categorized as single system LCH (SS-LCH) and multi-system LCH (MS-LCH) . MS-LCH can be categorized as high-risk type LCH and low-risk type LCH based on whether the organs at risk, including liver, spleen and bone marrow, are involved. The clinical severity of LCH ranges from benign skin lesions to invasive multi-organ disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【32】Pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta (PLEVA) is believed to be an inflammatory reaction caused by certain infective factors or secondary to T cell clonal proliferative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Clinical manifestations are multiple erythematous ulcerative necrotic lesions, which usually occur on the flexural side of extremities and the trunk. Scaly papules usually have a central punctum and develop into small vesicular with hemorrhagic necrosis, ulcers, and brown scabs, often leaving varioliformis scarring. Histologic analysis shows parakeratosis, basal layer vacuolization, extravasation of lymphocytes and erythrocytes extending into the epidermis, perivascular lymphocytic and histiocytic infiltration in the dermis. Immunohistochemistry reveals that the infiltrating cells are mainly CD3 <sup>+ </sup> and CD8 <sup>+ </sup> T lymphocytes.\n\n【33】Lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP) is a non-aggressive skin disorder with a tendency to self-regression. LyP is characterized by a variety of clinical features with solitary or aggregated papules and nodules, accompanied by central hemorrhage, necrosis and crusts, half of which remain superficial atrophic scars after healing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. There are five typical histopathologic subtypes of LyP: A, B, C, D and E, which vary according to the predominant cell type and tropism. The most common form is type A, which demonstrates the wedge-shaped dermal cellular infiltrate containing large anaplastic cells, plasma cells, pleomorphic lymphocytes and histiocytes. Immunohistochemistry shows CD30 expression in large anaplastic or pleomorphic lymphoid cells.\n\n【34】Treatment strategies of LCH depend on the site, extent and severity of the disease. In the cases of single lesion, topical steroids, surgical excision, thalidomide, methotrexate and phototherapy have all been used. Combined chemotherapy is recommended in a diffuse multi systemic disease or when disease relapses or progresses. Recently, BRAF V600E mutations has been found in nearly half of LCH cases, which is a significant implications for both molecular diagnostics and targeted therapies using specific BRAF oncogenic kinase inhibitors such as vemurafenib or dabrafenib , especially for refractory and relapsed cases.\n\n【35】Considering the age and severity of the disease, we prescribed topical corticosteroids, twice per day, and moisturizers to the patient. After 2 weeks treatment, the pruritus and scaling papules lesions improved obviously. Full blood count, internal organs’ function, growth and development were all in normal ranges without life-threatening complications during the 6-month follow-up.\n\n【36】Key Points\n\n【37】   Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is regarded as a heterogeneous disease, with remarkably diverse clinical spectrum, ranging from isolated skin or bone lesions to a diffuse disease that can affect nearly any organ.\n\n【38】   Histopathologically, LCH is characterized by diffuse infiltrate of heteromorphic histocytes with reniform nuclei, fine chromatin and abundant pale eosinophilic cytoplasm, accompanied by large eosinophils.\n\n【39】   LCH is currently categorized as single system LCH (SS-LCH) and multi-system LCH (MS-LCH) by extent of single or multiple systems involvement and the presence of risk organ involvement.

She previously tried over the counter hair growth preparations and biotin, without any improvements.\n\n【15】Physical Examination\n--------------------\n\n【16】On examination, diffuse thinning was noted over the fronto-parietal scalp with preservation of the frontal hairline . There was no scalp erythema or scaling and the pull test was negative. Variability in the diameter of the hairs and miniaturization were noted on dermoscopy. In addition, a horse-shoe shaped linear band of hair loss was noted extending from the frontal to occipital scalp, corresponding to the location of the adhesive attachment of the patient’s hair replacement unit.\n\n【17】删除3：<u>Figure 4.1\n\n【18】Androgenetic alopecia and treatment with minoxidil 5 % foam.

After 6 months of topical minoxidil 5 % foam, there was significant re-growth in the fronto-parietal scalp ( b )</u>\n\n【19】Clinical Differential Diagnosis\n-------------------------------\n\n【20】The clinical differential diagnosis included androgenic alopecia, central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia (CCCA), chronic telogen effluvium and alopecia areata 删除10：<u>(Callender et al. 2004 )</u>. CCCA and traction alopecia are the most common causes of hair loss in African American females 删除10：<u>(Rogers and Callender 2014 )</u>. Diagnostic clues in differentiating the different causes of hair loss include the pattern of hair loss, symptomatology, and dermoscopy findings.\n\n【21】Histopathology\n--------------\n\n【22】Histologically, miniaturization of terminal hairs into vellus hairs, a decreased anagen-to-telogen ratio, decreased follicular density in long-standing cases, and an absence of inflammation was noted. It is important to indicate the patient ethnicity on the scalp biopsy requisition as African-American patients have been noted to have a lower normal follicular density compared to Caucasians (22 vs 36 follicles) on a 4 mm punch biopsy 删除10：<u>(Blumeyer et al. 2011 )</u>.\n\n【23】Diagnosis\n---------\n\n【24】Androgenetic Alopecia\n\n【25】Case Treatment\n--------------\n\n【26】The nature of the condition was discussed with the patient, and emphasis was placed on the importance of initiating treatment early. Treatment options discussed include topical minoxidil 2 % solution or foam bid, minoxidil 5 % solution or foam once daily and oral spironolactone. Risks and benefits were discussed regarding each. The patient decided to begin with topical minoxidil 5 % foam daily for a trial of 6 months. The patient noticed significant regrowth at her 6 month follow up  and has continued it for the past 2 years, without further clinical progression of the miniaturization.\n\n【27】Discussion\n----------\n\n【28】Hair loss is a common problem that challenges patients from all cultural backgrounds, especially in females of color. In fact, Halder et al. reported that alopecia is the fifth most common condition seen in a dermatologic private practice that treats mainly African-American patients 删除10：<u>(Halder et al. 1983 )</u>. Androgenic alopecia (AGA), also known as androgenetic alopecia, alopecia androgenetica, female pattern hair loss (FPHL), and male pattern hair loss (MPHL), is the most common form of hair loss 删除10：<u>(McElwee and Shapiro 2012 )</u>; although the exact prevalence in black males and females is not known.\n\n【29】The pathogenesis of androgenic alopecia is multifactorial with both hormonal and hereditary mechanisms involved. Elevated levels of 5α reductase type-2 (5αR-II) are located in the hair follicles of patients with AGA 删除10：<u>(Cowper and Knopp 2012 )</u>. Dihydrotestosterone, formed from the action of 5αR-II on testosterone, binds to the androgen receptor (AR) and the hormone-receptor complex then activates genes responsible for the gradual transformation of large, terminal follicles to small, miniaturized ones 删除10：<u>(Cowper and Knopp 2012 )</u>. Although the biochemical composition of hair is similar among racial and ethnic groups, hair in people of African descent is known to have an elliptical, curly morphology with lower total hair density, total number of terminal follicles, and terminal anagen hairs making management of this process in skin of color more challenging 删除10：<u>(Rogers and Callender 2014 )</u>.\n\n【30】There is a paucity of data on the genetics of this type of hair loss, yet proposed theories on the inheritance pattern include autosomal dominance with incomplete penetrance and polygenic inheritance. This is suggested by twin studies identifying genetics for an estimated 80 % of the predisposition to pattern baldness and the clinical observations of patients’ families that are diagnosed with AGA 删除10：<u>(Cowper and Knopp 2012 )</u>.\n\n【31】The clinical manifestations are the same across all ethnic groups with noticeable differences between genders. MPHL in men tends to start in the bitemporal scalp, then progresses to involve the vertex and frontal hairline. FPHL in females shows diffuse thinning over the crown and frontal scalp with preservation of the anterior hairline  referred to as the “Christmas tree” pattern 删除10：<u>(Blumeyer et al. 2011 )</u>.\n\n【32】删除3：<u>Figure 4.2\n\n【33】Androgenetic alopecia and the Christmas tree pattern. Female pattern hair loss in females shows diffuse thinning over the crown and frontal scalp with preservation of the anterior hairline, referred to as the “Christmas tree” pattern</u>\n\n【34】It is important to note that AGA is not only a cosmetic issue, but it may entail many psychological and medical issues in its process. Many affected patients develop negative self-esteem and experience social problems causing major effects in their quality of life (QoL) 删除10：<u>(Callender et al. 2004 )</u>. Chen et al. reported that the most common concerns of African-American females with alopecia are everyday functioning (i.e. hairstyling), emotional issues, and concerns with the appearance of the scalp 删除10：<u>(Callender et al. 2004 )</u>. Therefore, early diagnosis and initiation of therapies in patients of African descent are essential in minimizing the overall effects on the patient.\n\n【35】There are several disorders that have been linked to androgenic alopecia including: polycystic ovary syndrome, postmenopausal ovarian hyperthecosis, administration of adrenocorticotropic hormone, and prostate cancer 删除10：<u>(Cowper and Knopp 2012 )</u>. These disorders are linked to overproduction of androgens and should be further worked up based on the clinical decision of the provider.\n\n【36】Treatment\n---------\n\n【37】Androgenetic alopecia has several therapeutic options, both surgical and medical. The morphological structure of African-American hair presents specific challenges and special considerations when choosing an effective treatment plan for AGA. The elliptical, curly morphology, lower total hair density, total number of terminal follicles, and terminal anagen hairs are all factors that must be considered when treating African-American patients with hair loss 删除10：<u>(Rogers and Callender 2014 )</u>.\n\n【38】Across all ethnicities topical minoxidil (5 % BID in males and 2 % BID or 5 % daily in females) is the mainstay medical therapy for treatment of AGA 删除10：<u>(Callender et al. 2004 ; Blumeyer et al. 2011 )</u>. Its exact mechanism of promoting hair growth is unclear but it is known to convert miniaturized hairs into terminal hairs with a near normal morphology. In addition, minoxidil has Level 1 evidence of high rates of efficacy in preventing progression of hair loss and improving hair growth with high safety profiles and practicability for the patient 删除10：<u>(Blumeyer et al. 2011 )</u>. Topical minoxidil is commercially available as a solution and foam and can be compounded into a gel or ointment. The solution or foam formulations may cause hair to return to its natural curly state in the black female patient with thermally straightened hair. To decrease this effect, the ointment formulation can be used as an alternative 删除10：<u>(Callender et al. 2004 )</u>.\n\n【39】Anti-androgens are the second most popular treatment for AGA. Finasteride, a potent and highly selective synthetic 5α reductase type-2 inhibitor, prevents the conversion of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT), the hormone responsible for the miniaturization seen in AGA. Double blinded, placebo-controlled trials examined the 1 mg dose in patients. While a significant increase in hair counts were noted in men with AGA after 6–12 months, there were no differences in the terminal to miniaturized hair ratio in females. Camacho and colleagues reported significant hair growth using finasteride 2.5 mg/day in 41 females with AGA and SAHA (seborrhea, acne, hirsutism and alopecia) 删除10：<u>(Camacho 2001 )</u>. Some studies have shown greater efficacy in the treatment of AGA with dutasteride, a 5α reductase type-1 inhibitor. However, dutasteride is not FDA approved in the treatment of AGA and Phase III clinical trials are currently ongoing. Spironolactone, a competitive aldosterone antagonist, has mild antiandrogenic effects by blocking the androgen receptor and preventing its interaction with DHT. Spironolactone may have a preventative effect in FPHL and may reduce shedding in females without hyperandrogenism. It is not FDA approved in the treatment of AGA and should not be used in men due to its anti-androgen effects. It requires concurrent contraception in fertile females and monitoring for menstrual disturbances and hyperkalemia 删除10：<u>(Blumeyer et al. 2011 )</u>.\n\n【40】Hair transplantation as an option in black patients is increasing in popularity. The surgical correction of hair loss in patients of African descent poses many considerations and challenges when compared to patients of other ethnicities. Black patients have curved hair follicles, a lower hair density, lower number of follicular units with a higher number of hairs within each unit and a higher risk of keloid formation when compared to others 删除10：<u>(Callender et al. 2004 )</u>. Therefore, the use of larger punch grafts (minigrafts and micrografts), donor harvesting with a bended Personna blade or flexible Dermablades, and transplanting hairs from the frontal area caudally is a better option for this population 删除10：<u>(Rogers and Callender 2014 )</u>. Patients with a known medical or family history of keloids can benefit from test transplantation to observe for thick scar formation. Therefore, in black patients with AGA refractory to medical treatment, transplantation can be a safe and a long-term therapeutic option.\n\n【41】Low-level light/laser therapy and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) are innovative hair loss therapies that are gaining popularity 删除10：<u>(Gkini et al. 2014 )</u>. Paradoxical hair growth occurred has occurred in patients undergoing laser hair removal when relatively low fluences were used 删除10：<u>(Nusbaum et al. 2013 )</u>. The mechanism of action of this phenomenon is unknown but one theory includes the absorption of photons by cytochrome oxidase, modulating gene regulation to decrease apoptosis and prolongation of the anagen phase 删除10：<u>(Nusbaum et al. 2013 )</u>. Improvement in terminal hair density was observed with treatment with low-level laser device versus a sham device on the entire scalp three times weekly for 26 weeks in both males and females 删除10：<u>(Jimenez et al. 2014 )</u>. Over the counter home-use handheld devices include HairMax LaserComb <sup>® </sup> , Sunetics Laser Hair Brush <sup>® </sup> , and the X5 Hair Laser <sup>® </sup> . LaserCap <sup>® </sup> is also a home-use system that must be prescribed. The in-office systems include the Sunetics Model G <sup>® </sup> and MEP90 <sup>® </sup> system. PRP therapy includes injecting autologous platelets into the scalp that are known to release growth factors. There is insufficient evidence to support direct stimulation of hair growth but one clinical trial noted that PRP showed an increase in target hair counts compared with control 删除10：<u>(Nusbaum et al. 2013 )</u>. If PRP is administered with dalteparin and protamine microparticles as carriers, hair shaft diameter and target hair counts are proposed to increase 删除10：<u>(Nusbaum et al. 2013 )</u>. Further studies are needed to evaluate PRP as a FDA approved hair loss therapy.\n\n【42】Scalp protheses are practical for patients with extensive hair loss without significant improvement with medical therapies who are not candidates for surgical hair restoration therapy.\n\n【43】Key Points\n----------\n\n【44】   Androgenic alopecia is the most common cause of hair loss.\n\n【45】   It is characterized by non-scarring hair loss under the influence of androgens, miniaturization of terminal hairs into vellus hairs, a decreased anagen-to-telogen ratio, decreased follicular density in long-standing cases, and an absence of inflammation.\n\n【46】   There are several therapies to choose from when managing AGA with the most popular being topical minoxidil, oral finasteride, low-level laser/light therapies, and hair transplantation.\n\n【47】   More research is needed to effectively guide the treatment of AGA in patients with skin of color.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/14 13:41:14", "endTime": "2024/09/14 13:48:27", "cost": 432.986}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-13 00:45:56", "update_time": "2024-09-13 21:48:27", "grab_time": "2024-09-13 21:41:14"}
