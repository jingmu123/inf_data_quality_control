His hospital stay is complicated by the development of tracheobronchomalacia and respiratory insufficiency that necessitates mechanical ventilation.

Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is one of the most common autosomal-recessive diseases, affecting approximately one in 10,000 live births. It has a carrier frequency of approximately one in 50 and is characterized by symmetric proximal muscle weakness due to the degeneration of the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord. SMA is classically divided into three subtypes based on age of onset and clinical severity. Type I SMA (Werdnig-Hoffmann disease), the most severe, is characterized by the onset of significant muscle weakness and hypotonia in the first few months of life, and the inability to sit or walk. Manifestations may even occur in utero with reduced fetal movement. Fatal respiratory failure usually occurs before the age of 2 years. Muscle biopsy demonstrates large numbers of atrophic fibers that involve entire fascicles (panfascicular atrophy). Unlike SMA types II and III, this patient’s disease developed at an early age, so early milestones were not achieved. This is not the case in the less severe forms of SMA.  \n\n【6】Answer A is incorrect. BMD involves the same genetic locus that is affected in DMD, but its occurrence is less common. It follows a more indolent course, with onset often occurring in late childhood.  \n\n【7】Answer B is incorrect. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) are both characterized by defects in the 427-kDa protein dystrophin, encoded on the Xp21 region. DMD is the most common form of muscular dystrophy, with an incidence of about one in 3500 live births. Onset typically occurs after infancy and before the age of five. The clinical course is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and wasting that lead to wheelchair dependence by 10-12 years of age. Early motor milestones are met in patients with BMD and DMD.  \n\n【8】Answer C is incorrect. Type III spinal muscular atrophy, or Kugelberg-Welander disease, is characterized by the onset of proximal muscle weakness after the age of 2 years, the ability to walk independently until the disease progresses, and survival into adulthood.  \n\n【9】Answer D is incorrect. Type II spinal muscular atrophy is characterized by the onset of proximal muscle weakness before 18 months of age, the ability to sit but not to walk unaided, and survival beyond 4 years of age.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 11:35:00", "endTime": "2024/09/12 11:35:19", "cost": 18.982}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:33", "update_time": "2024-09-11 19:35:19", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 19:35:00"}

Headache is a very common chief complaint in the emergency department (ED)， accounting for up to 2.2% of all ED visits. When evaluating patients with headaches， the clinician’s goals are to identify those with serious or life-threatening conditions and to alleviate pain. The physi-cal examination should screen for non-neurological causes of headache including palpation of the sinuses (looking for tenderness consistent with sinusitis)， palpation of the temporal arteries (for tenderness or reduced pulsations suggestive of temporal arteritis). A thorough eye examination is important and should consist of assessment of the pupils， visual acuity， and fundoscopy. A detailed neurological examination should also be performed. This patient’s CT scan of the head is unremarkable， which does not definitively rule out subarachnoid hemorrhage. CT scan is often performed to rule out a cerebral mass before performing lumbar puncture (LP). Erythrocytes in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) or a xanthochromic CSF are considered diagnostic for SAH. However， xanthochromia may take up to 12 hours to appear. Therefore， a negative LP in the face of clinical suspicion for subarachnoid hemorrhage may necessitate repeat LP or other neuroimaging such as magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) or angiography.\n\n【15】Headaches can be caused by many intracranial and extracranial processes. One of the easiest ways to classify them is to separate them into primary and secondary causes. Primary headaches are most common and include migraine， tension-type， and cluster headaches. Secondary headaches are the result of some other disease pro-cess (eg， infection， tumor). Headaches can also be subdivided into critical or emer-gent versus nonemergent causes. Critical and emergent headaches have an etiology that mandates immediate identification and treatment . In contrast， nonemergent causes are benign and do not present any immediate threat to life. This category includes primary headache syndromes and postlumbar puncture head-aches. Less than 1% of patients with headache have a potentially life-threatening etiology， but identification of these patients is paramount.\n\n【16】When evaluating patients with headaches， the history should focus on the nature of the pain (location， severity， character， onset)， any associated symptoms， and aggravating or alleviating factors. Past medical history (including history of head trauma， medications) and family history are important to identify risk factors for serious disease. A history of prior headaches and any previous diagnostic studies can also be helpful. Potentially ominous historical findings include a sudden onset， the“worst headache of life，\"headaches dramatically different from past episodes， immu-nocompromised， new onset after age 50 years， and onset with exertion.\n\n【17】A complete physical examination with a detailed neurological evaluation can also help to separate the emergent from other causes. Abnormal vital signs can be a harbinger of life-threatening conditions. Other warning signs include altered men-tal status， abnormal fundi， meningeal signs， focal neurological deficits， and a rash suspicious for meningococcemia. Some types of headache have classic historical or examination findings that will aid in narrowing the differential .\n\n| Table 44-1· CRITICAL AND EMERGENT CAUSES OF HEADACHE  |\n| --- |\n| Anemia Anoxia Brain abscess Carbon monoxide poisoning Glaucoma Hypertensive encephalopathy Meningitis/encephalitis Mountain sickness Shunt failure Subarachnoid/other intracranial hemorrhage Temporal arteritis Tu mor/cerebral mass  |\n\n| Table 44-2· CLASSIC HISTORICAL AND EXAMINATION FINDINGS  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Etiology  | History  | Examination  |\n| Brain tumor  | Headache with nausea and vomiting，gradual onset， worse in morning， most commonly metastatic  | Papilledema， cognitive difficul-ties， focal neurological deficits  |\n| Cluster  | Severe， unilateral periorbital painwith lacrimation， rhinorrhea； worseat night； attacks “clustered” in shorttime period； more common in men  | Ipsilateral conjunctival injection，ptosis， miosis  |\n| Hypertensive encepha-lopathy  | Diffuse， throbbing headache； worsein morning  | Diastolic blood pressure>120-130 mm Hg， altered mental status， papilledema  |\n| Idiopathic intracranialhypertension (pseudo-tumor cerebril  | Headache with visual complaints，classically young obese females ofchildbearing age  | Papilledema， visual field defects  |\n| Meningitis  | Febrile illness  | Fever， meningismus， alteredmental status； Kernig and Brudz-inski signs  |\n| Migraine  | Unilateral， throbbing headache withnausea， vomiting， photophobia， pho-nophobia； may be accompanied byvisual， motor， or sensory disturbances； more common in women  |  |\n| Post lumbar puncture  | Bilateral，throbbing headache； worseupon standing， better when lyingdown  |  |\n| Subarachnoid hemorrhage  | “Thunderclap”onset，“worst head-ache of life，\" nausea， vomiting  | Retinal or subhyaloid hemor-rhages， meningismus， third orsixth nerve palsy  |\n| Temporal arteritis  | Pain over temporal artery； visualproblems，jaw claudication； fever，malaise， weight loss； joint pains；worse at night； more common inwomen>50 years old  | Tenderness or induration of tem-poral artery， decreased or absentpulse in temporal artery， opticnerve edema  |\n| Tension type  | Dull，“band-like\"headache  | Pericranial muscle tenderness  |\n\n【20】Because there is no routine workup of headaches， testing must be based on clinical suspicion of serious illness . Diagnostic imaging of the head should be considered for patients with sudden-onset severe headaches， HIV-positive patients with a new headache， and headaches with new abnormal findings (eg， focal deficit， altered mental status). Management includes stabilizing any life-threatening condi-tions， controlling pain， and addressing any underlying disease or specific etiologies.\n\n【21】SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE\n\n【22】Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) has an annual incidence of 1 in 10，000 Americans. Most cases occur in patients 40 to 60 years old. The presentation can be very subtle with a normal neurological examination， little or no nuchal rigidity， normal level of\n\n| Table 44-3·DIAGNOSTIC TESTS AND TREATMENT  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Etiology  | Diagnostic Tests  | Treatment  |\n| Brain tu mor  | CT； consider CT with contrastor MRI  | Neurosurgical consultation.

Nevertheless， the mortality associated with SAH approaches 50%. Thus， the ED physician must maintain a high index of suspicion in a patient with acute onset of severe headache. CT scan is usually the initial imaging test. Although the newer high-resolution CTs have higher sensitivity， no imaging procedure can definitively rule out SAH. Thus， many authorities advocate performing a lumbar puncture on all patients suspected of having SAH， even in the face of a normal CT scan. The lumbar puncture revealing xanthochromic CSF is considered the gold standard of diagnosis. Because xanthochromia may take up to 12 hours to develop， persistently bloody CSF is also worrisome for SAH. Neurosurgical evaluation is impor-tant once the diagnosis of SAH is established. Nimodipine may be helpful in decreasing cerebral arterial spasm and subsequent ischemia. Angiographic evaluation is usually 删除换行 undertaken to assess for possible need of surgical intervention of lesions such as berry aneurysms. Prognosis generally correlates with initial neurological status.\n\n【26】CEREBRAL CAUSES\n\n【27】Viral or bacterial meningitis can cause severe headache. Lumbar puncture is the best method of assessing for these infections. Immunocompromised states such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection may cause more subtle or atypical symptoms (eg， lack of fever or meningismus). Pre-LP CT does not necessarily need to be performed for a patient without risk factors for a mass lesion (such as HIV or cancer) and a normal neurological examination， normal level of consciousness， and absence of papilledema. Stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) may present as headache， but usually there is a history of or continued neurological deficit. The classic presentation of a brain tumor (headache associated with nausea or vomiting， sleep disturbances) is uncommon. Thus persistent atypical headache (such as new onset after age 50 years)， severe pain， or associated with even subtle cognitive or neurological function should be investigated， usually with CT.\n\n【28】TEMPORALARTERITIS\n\n【29】Temporal arteritis (TA) almost always occurs in patients older than age 50 years and is more common in women. It is caused by systemic arteritis， which presents as severe and throbbing headache， located over the frontotemporal region. Often， the temporal artery has a diminished pulse or is tender or is pulsating. Patients are diagnosed with TA if they fulfill three of the following criteria： age older than50 years， new-onset localized headache， decreased pulse or tenderness over the tempo-ral artery， an erythrocyte sedimentation rate exceeding 50 mm/h， and/or abnormal temporal artery biopsy. Vision loss is a potential complication， and immediate treat-ment should include prednisone 40 to 60 mg/d and urgent referral.\n\n【30】Migraine headaches are common. Onset usually occurs during the teenage years， and women are more often affected than men. Family history is often positive. The most common variety is migraine without aura， which is usually slowW iinn onset， uni- lateral， and throbbing.Photophobia， phonophobia， nausea， and vomiting frequently accompany the pain. Patients with migraines with aura have a similar type of head-ache that is preceded by reversible visual phenomena (most common)， paresthesias， motor deficits， or language difficulties. Treatment includes intravenous hydration if the patient is dehydrated and placing the patient in a dark， quiet room. Phar-macological options include dihydroergotamine (a nonspecific serotonin agonist)， sumatriptan (a selective serotonin agonist)， or dopamine antagonists such as meto-clopramide， chlorpromazine， or prochlorperazine. In general， opiates are used for patients with refractory pain.\n\n【31】Tension headaches are extremely common. They are usually characterized by bilat-eral， nonpulsating， “band-like\" pain around the forehead to the occiput. Nausea and 删除换行 vomiting are uncommon. Treatment includes acetaminophen， nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)， and stress reduction techniques.\n\n【32】Cluster headaches are rarer than other types of primary headache syndromes. They occur more commonly in men and usually start after 20 years of age. Patients typically present with unilateral， severe， orbital or temporal pain， often associated with ipsilateral lacrimation， nasal congestion， rhinorrhea， miosis， and/or ptosis. The headaches tend to occur in “clusters”for several weeks and then remit for months or years. High-flow oxygen is usually effective. DHE and sumatriptan can also help relieve symptoms.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【25】consciousness， and normal vital signs.

The etiology is largely unknown. However， point mutations of the K-ras gene have been observed in over 90 percent of the pancreatic tumors， suggesting abnormalities at the genetic level. Pain and nonspecific systemic symptoms such as weakness and weight loss are the usual first signs of malignancy. Obstructive jaundice is seen commonly because of the preference for tumors to occur in the head of the pancreas. The symptomatic course of pancreatic carcinoma is typically brief and progressive. Radiologic workups， including abdominal CT and ultrasound， are diagnostic for the cancer and are used for staging. No specific biological tests are avail-able for screening or early detection. Cancer of the pancreas is now the fifth most common cause of cancer-related death in the United States. The median survival period from the time of diagnosis to demise is arguably the worst of any of the cancers. The median survival for untreated advanced cases is approximately 3.5 months； with good treatment this increases to approxi-mately 6 months. The 5-year relative survival rate of patients with this can-cer is only 3 to 5 percent. Even though a Whipple operation is considered the treatment of choice for localized and early disease， fewer than 15 percent of pancreatic tumors overall are resectable at the time of diagnosis. The progno-sis of pancreatic carcinoma is one of the most dismal among any malignancies ever known.\n\n【9】APPROACHTO PANCREATIC CANCER\n\n【10】Objectives\n\n【11】List the risk factors for pancreatic cancer.\n\n【12】Describe the different neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas.\n\n【13】Describe the serum markers used for pancreatic cancer.\n\n【14】Definitions\n\n【15】Jaundice： A yellow discoloring of the skin， mucous membranes， and eyes caused by excess bilirubin in the blood. Common causes of jaundice in adults include prehepatic causes such as intravascular hemolysis， hepatic causes such as hepatitis A and hepatic tumors， and posthepatic causes， including obstruction of the bile duct as a result of infection， tumor， or gallstones.\n\n【16】Exocrine gland： A gland that secretes its products through ducts or canals， such as sweat glands or mammary glands. The secretion products pro-duce their biologic effects locally.\n\n【17】Endocrine gland： A gland， such as the pituitary or thyroid， that secretes its products， called hormones， directly into the bloodstream. Hormones generate their biologic effects at distant locations.\n\n【18】Pancreatic cancer and adenocarcinoma of the pancreas： By definition， pancreatic cancer includes all malignant neoplasms of the pancreas. It includes the tumors arising from the exocrine portion of pancreas such as gland-forming adenocarcinoma of the pancreas， those of ductal ori-gin， and tumors from endocrine components. Adenocarcinoma is the most common form of cancer， accounting for over 75 percent of all pan-creatic cancers.\n\n【19】DISCUSSION\n\n【20】Normal Pancreatic Histology\n\n【21】The pancreas is a small， spongy gland that lies just under the curvature of the stomach and deep within the abdomen. The majority of the pancreas is com-posed of exocrine glands， which produce enzymes necessary for food diges-tion. The secretions from acinar cells， the structural unit throughout the pancreas， containing salts and enzymes， are called pancreatic fluid， which eventually drains into the pancreatic duct. The pancreatic duct usually joins the bile duct and empties its combined digestive contents into the duodenum. Additionally， the pancreas has an endocrine， or hormonal， function. Inside specialized groupings of cells called the islets of Langerhans， the pancreas produces hormones such as insulin and glucagons， among other hormones. These molecules are secreted directly into the bloodstream， eliciting numerous biologic effects throughout the body.\n\n【22】Epidemiology\n\n【23】Each year approximately 30，000 people in the United States are diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Most of them will have passed away by the end of the first year. Most patients are between the ages of 60 and 80. Men tend to be affected more often than women. The median survival period from 删除换行 the time of diagnosis until demise is extremely short， with a mean of 3.5 months. It has been approximated that approximately 30 percent of the changes that initiate cancer of the pancreas are caused by smoking and that approximately8 percent are“secondary\" to a hereditary genetic predisposition. There does not appear to be a strong correlation between the onset of pancreatic adeno-carcinoma and the drinking of alcohol or coffee.\n\n【24】Biochemical Tests\n\n【25】Laboratory results often reveal nonspecific elevated bilirubin and elevated liver function enzymes as a result of biliary obstruction. The CA 19-9 marker， a Lewis blood group-related mucin， frequently is elevated in adenocarcinoma of the pan-creas， but its use in screening for or diagnosis of the cancer is not accepted in gen-eral practice. High CA 19-9 levels may be associated with but do not always indicate larger tumors and with a decreased likelihood of surgical resectability. The use of this marker is accepted more widely as a running measure in a partic-ular individual to help reflect the stability or progression of the cancer. Point mutation of K-ras is observed in 90 percent of pancreatic cancer patients. However， the utility of a screening test for K-ras mutation is not proven clinically.\n\n【26】Adenocarcinoma of the Pancreas\n\n【27】In up to 95 percent of cases， pancreatic cancer arises from the exocrine portion of the organ. Most of the exocrine tumors (approximately 90 percent) are from ductal cells-those which line the pancreatic ducts. Further， under the micro-scope， the appearance and arrangement of these carcinoma cells can appear duct like (or“adeno”)， giving the term adenocarcinoma to this most common form of pancreatic cancer. Approximately three-quarters of exocrine tumors of the pancreas arise in the head and neck of the pancreas. It is believed that cancer is caused by the mutations of a gene， which confer increased abnormal growth potential to cells. Among other abnormalities， an oncogene called K-ras is found to be altered in up to 95 percent of ductal adenocarcinomas of the pancreas. The Whipple operation (pancreaticoduodenectomy) typically isS pPerformed in patients with tumors localized in the head of the pancreas.\n\n【28】Other Malignant Tumors of the Pancreas\n\n【29】Neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas (islet-cell tumors) are much less common than tumors arising from the exocrine pancreas. Approximately 75percent of these tumors are “functioning，\" meaning that they are found to be producing symptoms related to one or more of the hormone peptides they secrete. The predominant peptide secreted gives the functioning islet-cell tumor its name. The hormones produced by neuroendocrine tumors include insulin， gastrin， glucagon， somatostatin， neurotensin， pancreatic polypep-tide (PP)， vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)， growth hormone-releasing factor (GRF)， and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)， among others.\n\n【30】Typically， the symptoms produced by the excess secretion of the predomi-nant hormone in a functioning endocrine tumor lead to the eventual diagnosis. It is not possible to determine malignancy from the histologic appearance. Malignancy is determined by finding additional metastatic sites. The natural history of neuroendocrine carcinoma tends to be favorable compared with that of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. For example， the median survival duration from the time of diagnosis for patients with nonfunctioning metastatic neu-roendocrine tumors approaches 5 years. Immediate treatment of the sympto-matic conditions created by the oversecretion of the hormone may be appropriate. Surgery is generally curative.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 14:21:36", "endTime": "2024/09/12 14:22:00", "cost": 24.402}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:32", "update_time": "2024-09-11 22:22:00", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 22:21:36"}

Position.— A thyroglossal cyst may develop anywhere  删除换行 along the thyroglossal tract starting from foramen caecum  删除换行 to the isthmus of the thyroid gland, but according to  删除换行 frequency, its position may be as follows :—\n\n【2】(a) Subhyoid position (below the hyoid bone);\n\n【3】(b) In the region of the thyroid cartilage (may be deviated  删除换行 to the left side);\n\n【4】(c) Suprahyoid position (above the hyoid bone);\n\n【5】(d) At the level of the cricoid cartilage;\n\n【6】(e) In the floor of the mouth;\n\n【7】(f) Beneath the foramen caecum.\n\n【8】2. Colour And Temperature.— Usually the overlying skin  删除换行 is normal. Only when the cyst becomes infected the overlying  删除换行 skin will be red and hot.\n\n【9】3. Tenderness.— The cyst only becomes tender if it is  删除换行 infected.\n\n【10】4. Size And Shape.— Thyroglossal cyst is spherical or oval  删除换行 with the long axis along the thyroglossal tract. The cyst varies  删除换行 in size from 0.5 cm to 5 cm in diameter. Due to prominence  删除换行 of the swelling being in front of the neck, patient often  删除换行 presents early even when it is small.\n\n【11】5. Consistency.— Though it is a cystic swelling, yet the  删除换行 consistency is often firm or hard depending upon the tension  删除换行 of fluid within the cyst.\n\n【12】6. Fluctuation Test is usually positive. When the cyst is a  删除换行 small one, Paget's test should be performed.\n\n【13】7. Transillumination Test may occasionally be positive,  删除换行 but due to the thick content with epithelial debris it is usually 删除换行 negative.\n\n【14】8. Mobility.— The cyst can be moved sideways but not  删除换行 vertically (along the length of the thyroglossal duct) as the  删除换行 cyst is tethered by the remnant of the thyroglossal duct.\n\n【15】The cyst moves with deglutition (because the swelling is  删除换行 attached to the hyoid bone by fibrous tissue).\n\n【16】The Peculiarity of the thyroglossal cyst is that it moves up 删除换行 with protrusion of the tongue. This can be examined by asking  删除换行 the patient to open her mouth. The clinician holds the cyst  删除换行 with his thumb and forefinger. The patient is asked to  删除换行 protrude her tongue. The clinician will feel that the swelling  删除换行 slips out of his grip and moves up. This is due to the fact  删除换行 that the swelling is attached to the foramen caecum of the  删除换行 tongue by an obliterated thyroglossal duct. Absence of this 删除换行 sign does not exclude the diagnosis as majority of the cysts are  删除换行 below the level of the hyoid bone and usually loses  删除换行 attachment with the tongue and so this test becomes negative.\n\n【17】9. It should be the practice to examine the base of the 删除换行 tongue for ectopic or lingual thyroid. It looks like a flattened  删除换行 strawberry tumour at the base of the tongue.\n\n【18】10. Regional Lymph Nodes are usually not enlarged unless  删除换行 the cyst is infected.\n\n【19】Differential Diagnosis.—\n\n【20】1. Subhyoid bursal cyst.— Though this cyst moves on  删除换行 deglutition, yet it does not move up with protrusion of the  删除换行 tongue. Moreover this cyst has a particular position with  删除换行 transversally oval in shape, whereas thyroglossal cyst is usually  删除换行 spherical and differs in position.\n\n【21】2. Sublingual dermoid is often difficult to differentiate  删除换行 from suprahyoid thyroglossal cyst. Again mobility with  删除换行 deglutition and protrusion of the tongue will help in the  删除换行 diagnosis.\n\n【22】3. Enlarged cervical lymph node.\n\n【23】4. An ectopic thyroid.\n\n【24】5. Solitary thyroid nodule from isthmus of thyroid gland. \n\n【25】THYROGLOSSAL CYST\n\n【26】1. Recurrent infection;\n\n【27】2. Fistula formation;\n\n【28】3. Carcinoma, though rare, may arise in the thyroglossal  删除换行 cyst. Mostly this is adenocarcinoma of thyroid origin due to  删除换行 inclusion of the thyroid tissue in the wall of the duct.\n\n【29】Treatment.—\n\n【30】A thyroglossal cyst should be excised as a routine, as due  删除换行 to the presence of lymphatic tissue in the wall infection is  删除换行 inevitable. An infected cyst often looks like an abscess and  删除换行 incision will lead to the formation of a sinus. Excision of the  删除换行 cyst should also include any persistent portion of the track,  删除换行 otherwise recurrence is inevitable. The intimate relationship  删除换行 between the track and the body of the hyoid bone,  删除换行 necessitates excision of a segment of the bone from the  删除换行 midline to make sure that this portion of the track has been  删除换行 excised.\n删除3：<u>Fig.8.11.— Shows a large subhyoid thyroglossal cyst.删除27：<u>108 A TEXTBOOK ON SURGICAL SHORT CASES</u></u>\n\n【31】HISTORY.—\nAetiology.—\n\n【32】It is never congenital. This acquired sinus or fistula  删除换行 originates from —\n\n【33】(i) Bursting of an infected thyroglossal cyst.\n\n【34】(ii) An incision on the infected thyroglossal cyst with  删除换行 the mistaken diagnosis of an abscess.\n\n【35】(iii) Incomplete removal of the thyroglossal cyst.\n\n【36】Pathology.—\n\n【37】It must be remembered that though a thyroglossal sinus  删除换行 or fistula is an acquired condition it is almost always associated  删除换行 with the congenital abnormality of persistence of the  删除换行 thyroglossal tract. This tract is lined by columnar epitheliurrl. \n\n【38】This sinus is covered with a hood of skin with its concavity  删除换行 downwards due to more growth of the neck as a whole in  删除换行 comparison to that of the thyroglossal tract. This sinus often  删除换行 discharges mucus and is the site of recurrent attacks of  删除换行 inflammation.\n\n【39】Clinical features.—\n\n【40】(i) It is usually seen between the ages of 15 and 40  删除换行 years.\n删除3：<u>Fig.8.12 .— A thyroglossal fistula at the base of the neck.</u>\n\n【41】(ii) The patient often gives history that the fistula closes  删除换行 by itself. After an interval of time it becomes infected and  删除换行 painful, then it starts discharging with relief of pain. After a  删除换行 few days the fistula closes again. On careful enquiry one can  删除换行 get the history of presence of a previous swelling (thyroglossal  删除换行 cyst) which was infected and subsequently burst with the  删除换行 development of this sinus or somebody attempted incision  删除换行 of the cyst to drain it.\n\n【42】(iii) The position of the fistula is usually in the midline  删除换行 but varies — it may be either suprahyoid, subhyoid or in  删除换行 front of the thyroid cartilage.\n\n【43】(iv) The fistula may be infected with red hot  删除换行 surrounding skin. Otherwise the skin around the fistula is  删除换行 usually normal.\n\n【44】(v) Characteristic feature of the fistula is that it is covered  删除换行 with a hood of skin or semilunar fold of skin just above the  删除换行 fistula. If the tongue is protruded the fistula will be pulled  删除换行 up with prominence of the dimple.\n\n【45】Treatment.—\n\n【46】Excision of the fistula alongwith the thyroglossal tract as  删除换行 far as possible upto the base of the tongue is the treatment  删除换行 of choice. If a portion of the thyroglossal tract is left behind  删除换行 there is chance of recurrence. Presence of any ectopic thyroid  删除换行 tissue along the thyroglossal tract must be excluded since  删除换行 excision of this thyroid tissue may lead to myxoedema since  删除换行 this may be the only thyroid tissue present in the body.\n\n【47】Sistrunk's operation is usually performed where a horizontal  删除换行 elliptical incision is made circumcising the sinus opening  删除换行 and the tract is followed up and dissected upto the hyoid  删除换行 bone. Another transverse collar incision is made in front of  删除换行 the hyoid bone and a portion of the middle of the hyoid  删除换行 bone is excised and the tract remains attached to this excised  删除换行 portion of the hyoid bone. The tract is further followed up  删除换行 to the base of the tongue and excised.\n\n【48】SYMPTOMS.—\nIt is a congenital sequestration dermoid cyst and is formed  删除换行 by inclusion of the surface ectoderm at the fusion line of the  删除换行 first branchial arch or the mandibular arch. Such cysts are 删除换行 always in the midline and may be above or below the  删除换行 mylohyoid muscle.\n\n【49】EXAMINATIONS.—\n\n【50】It is a thin walled cyst lined by squamous epithelium  删除换行 and the wall contains hair follicles, sweat glands and  删除换行 sebaceous glands. The content is cheesy material which is  删除换行 sebaceous material secreted by the sebaceous glands in the  删除换行 lining epithelium. Unlike other dermoid cysts, it never  删除换行 contains hair.\n\n【51】Types.—\n\n【52】Usually this is a midline cyst, yet a few dermoid cysts are  删除换行 seen to be of lateral veriety. These lateral variety cysts usually  删除换行 derive from the second branchial cleft. So the types are :\n\n【53】1. MEDIAN VARIETY—\n\n【54】(a) Supramylohyoid variety;\n\n【55】(b) Inframylohyoid variety.\n\n【56】2. LATERAL VARIETY—\n\n【57】(a) Supramylohyoid variety;\n\n【58】(b) Inframylohyoid variety.\n\n【59】COMPLICATIONS.—\n\n【60】History.—\n\n【61】1. Age.— Though it is a congenital swelling, yet patients  删除换行 usually present between the ages of 10 and 25 years.\n\n【62】2. Sex.— Both sexes are equally involved.删除27：<u>SWELLINGS IN THE NECK 109</u>\n\n【63】Symptoms.—\n\n【64】Patients usually complain of a painless swelling under the 删除换行 tongue in the floor of the mouth or just below the point of  删除换行 the chin. It is usually painless, but when the swelling  删除换行 suddenly increases in size, patient may complain of pain. \n\n【65】Very rarely the contents become infected and the cyst  删除换行 becomes painful and tense.\n\n【66】Physical examinations.—\n\n【67】1. MEDIAN VARIETY :\n\n【68】(a) Supramylohyoid variety or sublingual variety :—\n\n【69】(i) It is a midline swelling on the floor of the mouth.\n\n【70】(ii) Mucous membrane of the mouth over the swelling  删除换行 is usually normal. The cyst is often spherical and by the  删除换行 time the petient comes to the clinician it is usually 2 to 7  删除换行 cm in diameter.\n\n【71】(iii) The surface is smooth with definite edge.\n\n【72】(iv) It is a cystic swelling and fluctuation test is positive. \n\n【73】Bimanual palpation will reveal the extents of the cyst and  删除换行 gives a better idea regarding fluctuation.\n\n【74】(v) Transillumination test is usually negative (cf. \n\n【75】ranula).\n\n【76】Differential Diagnosis.—\n\n【77】Ranula.— It is usually on one or the other side and not  删除换行 a typical midline swelling. It is a brilliantly translucent  删除换行 swelling.\n\n【78】(b) Inframylohyoid or cervical variety :—\n\n【79】(i) It is a swelling in the submental region and gives  删除换行 rise to a ‘double chin’ appearance.\n\n【80】(ii) The overlying skin in usually normal.\n\n【81】(iii) Bimanual palpation will give a clear idea regarding  删除换行 the extent of the cyst and fluctuation.\n\n【82】(iv) Fluctuation test is positive.\n\n【83】(v) Transillumination test is negative.\n\n【84】(vi) It does not move up with deglutition.\n\n【85】(vii) It does not move with protrusion of the tongue.\n\n【86】Differential Diagnosis.—\n\n【87】(i) Suprahyoid thyroglossal cyst — which moves up  删除换行 with protrusion of the tongue.\n\n【88】(ii) Submental lymph node swelling.\n\n【89】2. LATERAL VARIETY :\n\n【90】(a) Supramylohyoid variety.—\n\n【91】It is an opaque cystic swelling in the floor of the mouth  删除换行 on one side or the other. Transillumination test is negative.\n\n【92】Differential Diagnosis.—\n\n【93】Ranula — transillumination test is positive.\n\n【94】(b) Inframylohyoid variety.—\n\n【95】It is a cystic swelling in the submandibular region. \n\n【96】Bimanual palpation is extremely necessary to know the extent  删除换行 of the cyst and to exclude plunging ranula.\n\n【97】Differential Diagnosis.—\n\n【98】(i) Plunging ranula — transillumination test is positive.\n\n【99】(ii) Submandibular lymph node swelling — solid  删除换行 swelling.\n\n【100】(iii) Submandibular salivary gland swelling — solid  删除换行 swelling.\n\n【101】TREATMENT.— Total excision is the treatment of  删除换行 choice.\n\n【102】Supramylohyoid varieties are approached through the  删除换行 floor of the mouth.\n\n【103】Inframylohyoid varieties are approached through the neck  删除换行 by curved incision along the Langer's line over the cyst. \n\n【104】Plastic surgeons would prefer to excise these cysts through  删除换行 the floor of the mouth by retracting the posterior border of  删除换行 the mylohyoid muscle.\n\n【105】THYROGLOSSAL FISTULA\n\n【106】When a typical ranula is associated with cervical  删除换行 prolongation, it is called a deep or plunging ranula. This  删除换行 type of ranula passes beyond the floor of the mouth along  删除换行 the posterior border of the mylohyoid muscle and appears  删除换行 in the submandibular region. For description of ranula the  删除换行 students are referred to the chapter of‘MOUTH’. This ranula  删除换行 may be derived from the cervical sinus and thus an  删除换行 embryological remnant .\n\n【107】Diagnosis.— Whenever a case of ranula is detected on  删除换行 the floor of the mouth, the submandibular region of the  删除换行 neck should be examined by inspection and palpation.\n\n【108】Bidigital palpation of the swelling.— One finger is placed  删除换行 in the oral cavity and the other on the submandibular region  删除换行 of the neck. Cross fluctuation can be elicited by pushing  删除换行 one finger and palpating the impulse by the other finger  删除换行 and vice-versa.\n\n【109】Complications. (i) This may burst due to repeated  删除换行 trauma and reappear.\n\n【110】(ii) Ranula may be rarely infected.\n\n【111】(iii) A big ranula may cause difficulty in eating and  删除换行 speech.\n\n【112】Differential Diagnosis.— (i) Sublingual dermoid.— This  删除换行 swelling is more often a midline swelling. This swelling is  删除换行 not translucent whereas a plunging ranula is brilliantly  删除换行 translucent.\n\n【113】(ii) Lipoma.\n\n【114】(iii) Submandibular lymph node swelling.\n\n【115】(iv) Submandibular salivary gland swelling.\n\n【116】Treatment.— Treatment is excision of the ranula. In case 删除换行 of deep or plunging ranula, the incision should be made on  删除换行 the neck along the Langer's line. So the approach is through删除27：<u>110 A TEXTBOOK ON SURGICAL SHORT CASES</u>\n\n【117】the neck. Excision must be complete and no wall of the cyst  删除换行 should be left behind.\n\n【118】SUBLINGUAL DERMOID CYST\n\n【119】(CONGENITAL TORTICOLLIS,\n\n【120】FIBROMATOSIS COLI)\n\n【121】Though it is called congenital torticollis, yet it is not a  删除换行 true congenital abnormality.\n\n【122】Aetiology- (i) Infarction of the central portion of one  删除换行 sternomastoid muscle at the time of birth is the most accepted  删除换行 aetiology. The infarcted muscle is gradually replaced by  删除换行 fibrous tissue which contracts. This infarct is often caused  删除换行 by a temporary acute venous obstruction within the muscle  删除换行 substance in utero or during labour.\n\n【123】(ii) Many pathologists consider that it is a congenital  删除换行 anomaly and may be associated with other congenital  删除换行 anomalies such as dislocation of the hip.\n\n【124】(iii) The same theory of infarction remains but some  删除换行 pathologists consider that the sternomastoid branch of the  删除换行 superior thyroid artery is affected. This is an ‘end artery’  删除换行 which supplies the middle part of the sternomastoid muscle. \n\n【125】It is often found obliterated in association with sternomastoid  删除换行 tumour.\n\n【126】(iv) Trauma.— Trauma may be inflicted to the  删除换行 sternomastoid muscle during delivery and may tear a few of  删除换行 its fibres.

This acquired sinus or fistula  删除换行 originates from —\n\n【33】(i) Bursting of an infected thyroglossal cyst.\n\n【34】(ii) An incision on the infected thyroglossal cyst with  删除换行 the mistaken diagnosis of an abscess.\n\n【35】(iii) Incomplete removal of the thyroglossal cyst.\n\n【36】Pathology.—\n\n【37】It must be remembered that though a thyroglossal sinus  删除换行 or fistula is an acquired condition it is almost always associated  删除换行 with the congenital abnormality of persistence of the  删除换行 thyroglossal tract. This tract is lined by columnar epitheliurrl. \n\n【38】This sinus is covered with a hood of skin with its concavity  删除换行 downwards due to more growth of the neck as a whole in  删除换行 comparison to that of the thyroglossal tract. This sinus often  删除换行 discharges mucus and is the site of recurrent attacks of  删除换行 inflammation.\n\n【39】Clinical features.—\n\n【40】(i) It is usually seen between the ages of 15 and 40  删除换行 years.\n删除3：<u>Fig.8.12 .— A thyroglossal fistula at the base of the neck.</u>\n\n【41】(ii) The patient often gives history that the fistula closes  删除换行 by itself. After an interval of time it becomes infected and  删除换行 painful, then it starts discharging with relief of pain. After a  删除换行 few days the fistula closes again. On careful enquiry one can  删除换行 get the history of presence of a previous swelling (thyroglossal  删除换行 cyst) which was infected and subsequently burst with the  删除换行 development of this sinus or somebody attempted incision  删除换行 of the cyst to drain it.\n\n【42】(iii) The position of the fistula is usually in the midline  删除换行 but varies — it may be either suprahyoid, subhyoid or in  删除换行 front of the thyroid cartilage.\n\n【43】(iv) The fistula may be infected with red hot  删除换行 surrounding skin. Otherwise the skin around the fistula is  删除换行 usually normal.\n\n【44】(v) Characteristic feature of the fistula is that it is covered  删除换行 with a hood of skin or semilunar fold of skin just above the  删除换行 fistula. If the tongue is protruded the fistula will be pulled  删除换行 up with prominence of the dimple.\n\n【45】Treatment.—\n\n【46】Excision of the fistula alongwith the thyroglossal tract as  删除换行 far as possible upto the base of the tongue is the treatment  删除换行 of choice. If a portion of the thyroglossal tract is left behind  删除换行 there is chance of recurrence. Presence of any ectopic thyroid  删除换行 tissue along the thyroglossal tract must be excluded since  删除换行 excision of this thyroid tissue may lead to myxoedema since  删除换行 this may be the only thyroid tissue present in the body.\n\n【47】Sistrunk's operation is usually performed where a horizontal  删除换行 elliptical incision is made circumcising the sinus opening  删除换行 and the tract is followed up and dissected upto the hyoid  删除换行 bone. Another transverse collar incision is made in front of  删除换行 the hyoid bone and a portion of the middle of the hyoid  删除换行 bone is excised and the tract remains attached to this excised  删除换行 portion of the hyoid bone. The tract is further followed up  删除换行 to the base of the tongue and excised.\n\n【48】SYMPTOMS.—\nIt is a congenital sequestration dermoid cyst and is formed  删除换行 by inclusion of the surface ectoderm at the fusion line of the  删除换行 first branchial arch or the mandibular arch. Such cysts are 删除换行 always in the midline and may be above or below the  删除换行 mylohyoid muscle.\n\n【49】EXAMINATIONS.—\n\n【50】It is a thin walled cyst lined by squamous epithelium  删除换行 and the wall contains hair follicles, sweat glands and  删除换行 sebaceous glands. The content is cheesy material which is  删除换行 sebaceous material secreted by the sebaceous glands in the  删除换行 lining epithelium. Unlike other dermoid cysts, it never  删除换行 contains hair.\n\n【51】Types.—\n\n【52】Usually this is a midline cyst, yet a few dermoid cysts are  删除换行 seen to be of lateral veriety. These lateral variety cysts usually  删除换行 derive from the second branchial cleft. So the types are :\n\n【53】1.

Age.— Though it is a congenital swelling, yet patients  删除换行 usually present between the ages of 10 and 25 years.\n\n【62】2. Sex.— Both sexes are equally involved.删除27：<u>SWELLINGS IN THE NECK 109</u>\n\n【63】Symptoms.—\n\n【64】Patients usually complain of a painless swelling under the 删除换行 tongue in the floor of the mouth or just below the point of  删除换行 the chin. It is usually painless, but when the swelling  删除换行 suddenly increases in size, patient may complain of pain. \n\n【65】Very rarely the contents become infected and the cyst  删除换行 becomes painful and tense.\n\n【66】Physical examinations.—\n\n【67】1. MEDIAN VARIETY :\n\n【68】(a) Supramylohyoid variety or sublingual variety :—\n\n【69】(i) It is a midline swelling on the floor of the mouth.\n\n【70】(ii) Mucous membrane of the mouth over the swelling  删除换行 is usually normal. The cyst is often spherical and by the  删除换行 time the petient comes to the clinician it is usually 2 to 7  删除换行 cm in diameter.\n\n【71】(iii) The surface is smooth with definite edge.\n\n【72】(iv) It is a cystic swelling and fluctuation test is positive. \n\n【73】Bimanual palpation will reveal the extents of the cyst and  删除换行 gives a better idea regarding fluctuation.\n\n【74】(v) Transillumination test is usually negative (cf. \n\n【75】ranula).\n\n【76】Differential Diagnosis.—\n\n【77】Ranula.— It is usually on one or the other side and not  删除换行 a typical midline swelling. It is a brilliantly translucent  删除换行 swelling.\n\n【78】(b) Inframylohyoid or cervical variety :—\n\n【79】(i) It is a swelling in the submental region and gives  删除换行 rise to a ‘double chin’ appearance.\n\n【80】(ii) The overlying skin in usually normal.\n\n【81】(iii) Bimanual palpation will give a clear idea regarding  删除换行 the extent of the cyst and fluctuation.\n\n【82】(iv) Fluctuation test is positive.\n\n【83】(v) Transillumination test is negative.\n\n【84】(vi) It does not move up with deglutition.\n\n【85】(vii) It does not move with protrusion of the tongue.\n\n【86】Differential Diagnosis.—\n\n【87】(i) Suprahyoid thyroglossal cyst — which moves up  删除换行 with protrusion of the tongue.\n\n【88】(ii) Submental lymph node swelling.\n\n【89】2. LATERAL VARIETY :\n\n【90】(a) Supramylohyoid variety.—\n\n【91】It is an opaque cystic swelling in the floor of the mouth  删除换行 on one side or the other. Transillumination test is negative.\n\n【92】Differential Diagnosis.—\n\n【93】Ranula — transillumination test is positive.\n\n【94】(b) Inframylohyoid variety.—\n\n【95】It is a cystic swelling in the submandibular region. \n\n【96】Bimanual palpation is extremely necessary to know the extent  删除换行 of the cyst and to exclude plunging ranula.\n\n【97】Differential Diagnosis.—\n\n【98】(i) Plunging ranula — transillumination test is positive.\n\n【99】(ii) Submandibular lymph node swelling — solid  删除换行 swelling.\n\n【100】(iii) Submandibular salivary gland swelling — solid  删除换行 swelling.\n\n【101】TREATMENT.— Total excision is the treatment of  删除换行 choice.\n\n【102】Supramylohyoid varieties are approached through the  删除换行 floor of the mouth.\n\n【103】Inframylohyoid varieties are approached through the neck  删除换行 by curved incision along the Langer's line over the cyst. \n\n【104】Plastic surgeons would prefer to excise these cysts through  删除换行 the floor of the mouth by retracting the posterior border of  删除换行 the mylohyoid muscle.\n\n【105】THYROGLOSSAL FISTULA\n\n【106】When a typical ranula is associated with cervical  删除换行 prolongation, it is called a deep or plunging ranula. This  删除换行 type of ranula passes beyond the floor of the mouth along  删除换行 the posterior border of the mylohyoid muscle and appears  删除换行 in the submandibular region. For description of ranula the  删除换行 students are referred to the chapter of‘MOUTH’. This ranula  删除换行 may be derived from the cervical sinus and thus an  删除换行 embryological remnant .\n\n【107】Diagnosis.— Whenever a case of ranula is detected on  删除换行 the floor of the mouth, the submandibular region of the  删除换行 neck should be examined by inspection and palpation.\n\n【108】Bidigital palpation of the swelling.— One finger is placed  删除换行 in the oral cavity and the other on the submandibular region  删除换行 of the neck. Cross fluctuation can be elicited by pushing  删除换行 one finger and palpating the impulse by the other finger  删除换行 and vice-versa.\n\n【109】Complications. (i) This may burst due to repeated  删除换行 trauma and reappear.\n\n【110】(ii) Ranula may be rarely infected.\n\n【111】(iii) A big ranula may cause difficulty in eating and  删除换行 speech.\n\n【112】Differential Diagnosis.— (i) Sublingual dermoid.— This  删除换行 swelling is more often a midline swelling. This swelling is  删除换行 not translucent whereas a plunging ranula is brilliantly  删除换行 translucent.\n\n【113】(ii) Lipoma.\n\n【114】(iii) Submandibular lymph node swelling.\n\n【115】(iv) Submandibular salivary gland swelling.\n\n【116】Treatment.— Treatment is excision of the ranula. In case 删除换行 of deep or plunging ranula, the incision should be made on  删除换行 the neck along the Langer's line. So the approach is through删除27：<u>110 A TEXTBOOK ON SURGICAL SHORT CASES</u>\n\n【117】the neck. Excision must be complete and no wall of the cyst  删除换行 should be left behind.\n\n【118】SUBLINGUAL DERMOID CYST\n\n【119】(CONGENITAL TORTICOLLIS,\n\n【120】FIBROMATOSIS COLI)\n\n【121】Though it is called congenital torticollis, yet it is not a  删除换行 true congenital abnormality.\n\n【122】Aetiology- (i) Infarction of the central portion of one  删除换行 sternomastoid muscle at the time of birth is the most accepted  删除换行 aetiology. The infarcted muscle is gradually replaced by  删除换行 fibrous tissue which contracts. This infarct is often caused  删除换行 by a temporary acute venous obstruction within the muscle  删除换行 substance in utero or during labour.\n\n【123】(ii) Many pathologists consider that it is a congenital  删除换行 anomaly and may be associated with other congenital  删除换行 anomalies such as dislocation of the hip.\n\n【124】(iii) The same theory of infarction remains but some  删除换行 pathologists consider that the sternomastoid branch of the  删除换行 superior thyroid artery is affected. This is an ‘end artery’  删除换行 which supplies the middle part of the sternomastoid muscle. \n\n【125】It is often found obliterated in association with sternomastoid  删除换行 tumour.\n\n【126】(iv) Trauma.— Trauma may be inflicted to the  删除换行 sternomastoid muscle during delivery and may tear a few of  删除换行 its fibres.

Position.— A thyroglossal cyst may develop anywhere  删除换行 along the thyroglossal tract starting from foramen caecum  删除换行 to the isthmus of the thyroid gland, but according to  删除换行 frequency, its position may be as follows :—\n\n【2】(a) Subhyoid position (below the hyoid bone);\n\n【3】(b) In the region of the thyroid cartilage (may be deviated  删除换行 to the left side);\n\n【4】(c) Suprahyoid position (above the hyoid bone);\n\n【5】(d) At the level of the cricoid cartilage;\n\n【6】(e) In the floor of the mouth;\n\n【7】(f) Beneath the foramen caecum.\n\n【8】2. Colour And Temperature.— Usually the overlying skin  删除换行 is normal. Only when the cyst becomes infected the overlying  删除换行 skin will be red and hot.\n\n【9】3. Tenderness.— The cyst only becomes tender if it is  删除换行 infected.\n\n【10】4. Size And Shape.— Thyroglossal cyst is spherical or oval  删除换行 with the long axis along the thyroglossal tract. The cyst varies  删除换行 in size from 0.5 cm to 5 cm in diameter. Due to prominence  删除换行 of the swelling being in front of the neck, patient often  删除换行 presents early even when it is small.\n\n【11】5. Consistency.— Though it is a cystic swelling, yet the  删除换行 consistency is often firm or hard depending upon the tension  删除换行 of fluid within the cyst.\n\n【12】6. Fluctuation Test is usually positive. When the cyst is a  删除换行 small one, Paget's test should be performed.\n\n【13】7. Transillumination Test may occasionally be positive,  删除换行 but due to the thick content with epithelial debris it is usually 删除换行 negative.\n\n【14】8. Mobility.— The cyst can be moved sideways but not  删除换行 vertically (along the length of the thyroglossal duct) as the  删除换行 cyst is tethered by the remnant of the thyroglossal duct.\n\n【15】The cyst moves with deglutition (because the swelling is  删除换行 attached to the hyoid bone by fibrous tissue).\n\n【16】The Peculiarity of the thyroglossal cyst is that it moves up 删除换行 with protrusion of the tongue. This can be examined by asking  删除换行 the patient to open her mouth. The clinician holds the cyst  删除换行 with his thumb and forefinger. The patient is asked to  删除换行 protrude her tongue. The clinician will feel that the swelling  删除换行 slips out of his grip and moves up. This is due to the fact  删除换行 that the swelling is attached to the foramen caecum of the  删除换行 tongue by an obliterated thyroglossal duct. Absence of this 删除换行 sign does not exclude the diagnosis as majority of the cysts are  删除换行 below the level of the hyoid bone and usually loses  删除换行 attachment with the tongue and so this test becomes negative.\n\n【17】9. It should be the practice to examine the base of the 删除换行 tongue for ectopic or lingual thyroid. It looks like a flattened  删除换行 strawberry tumour at the base of the tongue.\n\n【18】10. Regional Lymph Nodes are usually not enlarged unless  删除换行 the cyst is infected.\n\n【19】Differential Diagnosis.—\n\n【20】1. Subhyoid bursal cyst.— Though this cyst moves on  删除换行 deglutition, yet it does not move up with protrusion of the  删除换行 tongue. Moreover this cyst has a particular position with  删除换行 transversally oval in shape, whereas thyroglossal cyst is usually  删除换行 spherical and differs in position.\n\n【21】2. Sublingual dermoid is often difficult to differentiate  删除换行 from suprahyoid thyroglossal cyst. Again mobility with  删除换行 deglutition and protrusion of the tongue will help in the  删除换行 diagnosis.\n\n【22】3. Enlarged cervical lymph node.\n\n【23】4. An ectopic thyroid.\n\n【24】5. Solitary thyroid nodule from isthmus of thyroid gland. \n\n【25】THYROGLOSSAL CYST\n\n【26】1. Recurrent infection;\n\n【27】2. Fistula formation;\n\n【28】3. Carcinoma, though rare, may arise in the thyroglossal  删除换行 cyst. Mostly this is adenocarcinoma of thyroid origin due to  删除换行 inclusion of the thyroid tissue in the wall of the duct.\n\n【29】Treatment.—\n\n【30】A thyroglossal cyst should be excised as a routine, as due  删除换行 to the presence of lymphatic tissue in the wall infection is  删除换行 inevitable. An infected cyst often looks like an abscess and  删除换行 incision will lead to the formation of a sinus.

She described her initial symptoms as true loss of sensation as well as paresthesias over her left upper back and abdomen. She initially attributed her symptoms to shingles, which she had experienced several years prior. She then went on a cruise to the Caribbean; however, her symptoms progressed to a band of numbness from her umbilicus to her groin. She also noted that her left leg was numb to the touch.\n\n【3】She left the cruise early after she developed weakness in her left leg, which made it difficult for her to climb stairs. This was accompanied by paresthesias along the medial aspects of both arms to the fifth digits as well as hyperesthesia of the right leg.\n\n【4】Besides the prior episode of shingles, her past medical history was otherwise only notable for hypertension, which was well controlled on medication. She denied any prior neurologic symptoms except for the episode of shingles, and she denied any recent or remote trauma.\n\n【5】One of the most important decisions a neurologist makes is what parts of the neurologic exam to perform. There are situations in which the basic “screening” exam is insufficient to appropriately localize the lesion. When a patient gives a history that suggests a particular localization, like in this case, we should adapt our exam based on what the patient reports. Based on the history just provided, what is your initial hypothesis of the localization and what aspects of the neurologic exam would you focus on? What features would you test on exam in a more in-depth fashion than what you might typically do for a more basic screening exam ?\n\n【6】If you don’t know the answer to that question, that is okay. Read the following exam and think about why certain components were tested .\n\n【7】On examination, her mental status and cranial nerve testing was normal. Motor testing in the upper extremities and the right lower extremity was normal. Her left lower extremity was weak, 4 to 4− throughout, including a left foot drop. Sensory testing revealed decreased pinprick sensation in the right lower extremity below the waist. She had absent vibratory sensation in the left leg at the toes, medial malleolus, patella, and iliac crest. She also had patchy sensory loss to light touch over the back and abdomen. The plantar response of the right toe was down-going and the left toe was up-going. She had no axial or appendicular ataxia on exam. Her gait was unstable with a notable foot drop on the left with left leg circumduction.### What is the pace?\n\n【8】This patient presents with symptom onset and evolution over the past several weeks, which fits with a subacute time course of disease.### What is the localization?\n\n【9】First, we must decide whether her symptoms are attributable to a lesion in the central or peripheral nervous system. There are several clues in her examination that point to a central lesion, such as her up-going plantar response (or Babinski’s response), but where is the lesion within the central nervous system?\n\n【10】We need to further characterize where in the central nervous system the lesion lies (assuming a single lesion): brain, brainstem, or spinal cord. Her examination is notable for crossed sensory and motor deficits as well as dissociated sensory tract dysfunction. Remember, the spinothalamic tracts and the dorsal columns both begin in the periphery and travel via peripheral nerves to the dorsal root ganglia . The spinothalamic tracts synapse and decussate soon after entering the spinal cord, whereas the dorsal columns synapse in the dorsal root ganglia but do not decussate until they reach the medulla. Both of these are clues to our lesion localizing to the spinal cord, especially since she has no cranial nerve abnormalities.\n删除3：<u>Figure 11.1 ( A ) Descending lateral corticospinal tract, ( B ) ascending spinothalamic tract, and ( C ) ascending dorsal column. Note that in the spinal cord the fibers in the spinothalamic tract are crossed and contralateral to the side of origin whereas the fibers in the dorsal column and corticospinal tracts are uncrossed and ipsilateral.</u>\n\n【11】Reproduced by permission from Hal Blumenfeld, Neuroanatomy through Clinical Cases 删除10：<u>(New York, New York: Oxford University Press, 2018)</u>, 236, 277, 278.\n\n【12】Of note, these findings could have easily been missed if we had not performed a more thorough sensory examination. What prompted this change in exam? As alluded to previously, this is the importance of adapting the exam to the patient’s complaint and history. A patient who presents with a seizure likely does not need multiple sensory modalities tested. However, a patient who presents with weakness and numbness needs a more in-depth exam that reflects their symptoms.\n\n【13】We need to identify where the lesion is within the spinal cord. Can we assign one lesion in the spinal cord as the cause of all of her symptoms? It might seem daunting at first to have multiple findings in her examination that are attributable to multiple different ascending and descending pathways. I advise you to start with a pathway that is familiar. Take, for example, her left leg weakness. Is a lesion in the motor fibers in the spinal cord, which make up the corticospinal tracts, ipsilateral or contralateral to the deficit? The motor signal begins in the contralateral motor cortex, but the fibers cross in the pyramidal decussation in the brainstem, leaving the corticospinal tract ipsilateral for the length of the spinal cord. Thus, we know that our lesion must involve the left side of the spinal cord. Now, we just work in reverse for the other exam findings.\n\n【14】Our patient also has loss of vibration in her left leg. The axons that carry sensory information of vibration and proprioception travel in the uncrossed dorsal columns, and sensory information of pain and temperature is carried in the crossed spinothalamic tracts. It’s okay if you need to look up these diagrams , but all of the symptoms for each tract localize to the left side of the spinal cord. Our lesion involves the corticospinal, spinothalamic, and dorsal columns all on the left, so it must take up the entire left hemi-cord. The eponym for this is called Brown-Séquard syndrome.\n\n【15】Lastly, is the lesion in the cervical or thoracic spinal cord? Since our patient has symptoms in the upper extremities, we know that part of the cervical cord must be involved. However, her symptoms are only in the medial aspects of each forearm and fifth digits. That, plus the predominant lower extremity involvement, suggests a lower cervical cord or upper thoracic cord lesion.\n\n【16】That seems like a lot of work when written out, but we can save time and resources in our work-up of our patient. All we need now is to look at her cervical and thoracic spinal cord. However, before we do that, we need to generate a differential diagnosis.### What is the syndromic diagnosis?\n\n【17】Our patient is a 70-year-old woman who presents with a subacute myelopathy (spinal cord injury) involving the left hemi-cord.### What is the etiologic diagnosis?\n\n【18】Given the pace of her symptoms, possible etiologic diagnoses include neoplastic, infectious, inflammatory, or metabolic disorders. Since her symptoms localize to the spinal cord, we must also consider structural disease (such as spinal stenosis or a herniated disc).\n\n【19】Now that we have generated our differential etiologic diagnoses, let us take a look at an MRI of her cervical and thoracic spinal cord.### Additional information\n\n【20】Her MRI  shows a lesion in her spinal cord involving the lower cervical and upper thoracic cord. If you look closely at the axial cross-section, you will see that only the left side of the cord is involved. This is exactly what we suspected based on her examination. What we don’t see is any large mass or herniated disc, taking malignancy and structural spine disease off the differential. Thus, the possible etiologic diagnoses left on our differential are inflammatory or infectious disorders. However, we can’t identify a specific etiology without laboratory testing.\n删除3：<u>Figure 11.2 ( A ) MRI cervical spine sagittal STIR shows a longitudinally extensive lesion spanning her lower cervical and upper thoracic spinal cord ( arrows ). ( B ) MRI cervical spine axial T2 demonstrates a representative cross-section showing an eccentrically placed lesion in the left hemi-cord .### Conclusion</u>\n\n【21】Ultimately, she was diagnosed with the pathologic diagnosis of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) after serum testing revealed the presence of an aquaporin 4 antibody. NMOSD is an autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system. The most common sites of disease include the optic nerves and spinal cord. However, NMOSD can also cause inflammation in the area postrema, hypothalamus, and brain. Quick recognition of NMOSD is critical. The inflammatory attacks of NMOSD tend to be severe and less responsive to conventional treatment with high-dose steroids compared to multiple sclerosis. Prompt initiation of plasma exchange, which is often more effective than high-dose steroid monotherapy, can prevent more severe permanent neurologic disability.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 11:35:26", "endTime": "2024/09/12 11:35:43", "cost": 17.096}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:32", "update_time": "2024-09-11 19:35:43", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 19:35:26"}

The biological mother automatically has  删除换行 parental responsibility. Both parents have parental responsibility if they are married, or for  删除换行 children born after 1 December 2003 (in England and Wales), if they are named on the birth  删除换行 certificate. It is also possible for another person to acquire parental responsibility through a  删除换行 court order, or it may be given to a legal guardian or a local authority if they have care of the  删除换行 child.\n\n【7】Legally, consent is required only from one person with parental responsibility. However, it is  删除换行 clearly good practice to involve both parents where possible, particularly if treatment is inva删除8：<u>￾</u>sive or the benefits of treatment do not overwhelmingly outweigh the burdens. In situations  删除换行 where there is disagreement between parents, a clinician may still proceed with treatment  删除换行 if it is in the child’s best interests. However, there are a small group of decisions which  删除换行 should not be taken by one person with parental responsibility against the wishes of another, \n\n【8】e.g. non-therapeutic male circumcision and immunisations.\n\n【9】Where there is disagreement between parents and clinical team, a court order should be  删除换行 obtained before any treatment is given where there is time to do so. The European Court of \n\n【10】Human Rights in Glass v UK 通用删除7(英):<u>(2004)</u> stated that a failure to refer such cases to the court is a  删除换行 breach of the child’s Article 8 rights.\n\n【11】When a child presents for treatment, it is good medical practice for staff to inquire about the  删除换行 relationship the accompanying adult has with the child. Rarely would this need to be verified  删除换行 through other means. Adults other than parents, such as a child-minder or a teacher, cannot  删除换行 give consent to treatment. Nevertheless the Children Act 1989 authorises a person with care  删除换行 of a child to do ‘what is reasonable in all the circumstances of the case for the purpose of  删除换行 safeguarding or promoting the child’s welfare’. This would mean that another adult could  删除换行 bring a child for a routine assessment and facilitate examination for simple treatment, for  删除换行 example, tonsillitis.\n\n【12】In an emergency where no parent is present or contactable, urgent treatment which is in  删除换行 the child’s best interests may be given.

This patient is most likely suffering from acute gastroenteritis, probably of viral origin. While there are several causes of hypoalbuminemia, the most likely cause in this otherwise healthy man is simply a dilutional effect due to the large amounts of fluid he was given. This type of hypoalbuminemia is also seen in congestive heart failure.  \n\n【7】Answer B is incorrect . Chronic liver disease causes hypoalbuminemia as albumin is produced in the liver. However, this loss of synthetic liver function typically does not occur until the final stage of liver disease, cirrhosis. It is unlikely that this young and healthy individual has severe enough liver disease to cause a dysfunction in albumin synthesis.  \n\n【8】Answer C is incorrect . Malabsorptive states, such as short bowel syndrome and celiac sprue, can lead to decreased ability to absorb protein. Over time this leads to hypoalbuminemia. This patient’s two day illness would not cause a protein deficiency severe enough to cause hypoalbuminemia.  \n\n【9】Answer D is incorrect . Nephrotic syndrome causes hypoalbuminemia due to excessive protein loss. This syndrome would also be classically accompanied by massive proteinuria, peripheral and periorbital edema, and hyperlipidemia. However, the vignette does not describe any of these findings, and the recent large fluid load is the most likely culprit for the hypoalbuminemia.  \n\n【10】Answer E is incorrect .

Any symptoms of an ele-vated ICP and/or impending herniation warrant special attention.\n\n【8】\\> Ways to reduce intracranial pressure： The anesthetic is designed to actively reduce and avoid any further increases in ICP， and to maintain cerebral perfusion. The elevation of ICP can worsen the cerebral edema， the midline shift， and ultimately， the neurological deficit. Increases in ICP are minimized by ensuring an adequate depth of anesthesia for painful parts of the case such as the application of head pins. ICP can be reduced by moder-ate hyperventilation， mannitol， and/or furosemide.\n\n【9】\\> Reason for observation in ICU postoperatively： Postoperatively， the strict control of blood pressure and periodic assessment of mental status and motor function are essential. Any acute deterioration in mental status or a new deficit suggests worsening cerebral edema or an intracranial bleed and requires an immediate intervention such as a CT scan or MRI.\n\n【10】ANALYSIS\n\n【11】Objectives\n\n【12】1\\. Learn the elements of a preoperative evaluation specific for patients with a SOL.\n\n【13】2\\. Become familiar with the relationship between arterial pressure， intracranial pressure， and cerebral perfusion pressure.\n\n【14】3\\.

Understand the effects of anesthetic agents on ICP and cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRO，).\n\n【16】5\\. Be able to describe an anesthetic plan for craniotomy.\n\n【17】Considerations\n\n【18】This patient has a SOL with a midline shift and new onset of a neurological deficit. He is receiving medical management for the cerebral edema and elevated\n\n【19】ICP. The preoperative assessment of this patient includes knowledge of the size and site of lesion and its vascularity. This information can be obtained by physical examination and evaluating the radiological images and medical record.\n\n【20】The goal of the anesthetic is to avoid any further increase in ICP. Further increases in ICP can worsen the cerebral edema and midline shift， and contribute to worsening of the neurologic deficit. Invasive blood pressure monitoring is required. However， in this case， the elevation of ICP is not severe enough to require intraoperative ICP monitoring.\n\n【21】General anesthesia is induced with thiopental or propofol， and muscle relaxation can be achieved with vecuronium. After endotracheal intubation， anesthesia is maintained with nitrous oxide/oxygen and low concentrations of an inhalational agent. A nicardipine infusion is used to treat hypertension， and fentanyl is administered for pain control.\n\n【22】The anesthetic technique is also designed to actively reduce ICP and maintain cerebral perfusion. The careful control of blood pressure， moderate hyperventilation， and use of diuretics such as furosemide and mannitol help to reduce the ICP. To minimize bleeding at the surgical site， the patient is extubated with minimal coughing and bucking， and strict control of blood pressure is maintained during emergence.\n\n【23】This patient will be monitored postoperatively in an intensive care setting to ensure the strict control of blood pressure and periodic assessment of men-tal status and motor function. Any acute deterioration in mental status or a new onset neurodeficit suggests a worsening of the cerebral edema or an intracranial bleed and must be addressed immediately.\n\n【24】Craniotomy for Brain Mass Excision\n\n【25】DEFINITIONS\n\n【26】ICP： Normal ICP is 5 to 15 mm Hg and reflects the relationship between the rigid cranial vault and its contents； that is， the brain， blood， and the CSF Sustained ICP of 15 to 20 mm Hg is considered elevated ICP.\n\n【27】CEREBRAL COMPLIANCE： When intracranial volume increases such as with a SOL， one of the other components (eg， CSF) is initially displaced， and ICP remains relatively normal. But as these “buffering mechanisms\"are exhausted and intracranial volume continues to increase， intracranialpressure then increases as well potentially resulting in brainstem herniation .\n\n【28】CEREBRAL AUTOREGULATION： Autoregulation maintains2aconstant level of cerebral blood flow (CBF) over a wide range of mean arterial pressures. Autoregulation is impaired by cerebral edema， brain injury， and inhaled\n删除3：<u>Figure 28-1.Pressure-volume compliance curve.</u>\n\n【29】anesthetics. The autoregulatory curve is shifted to the right in patients with systemic hypertension. Hypercarbia and hypoxia can increase cerebral blood flow irrespective of autoregulation.\n\n【30】CEREBRAL PERFUSION PRESSURE (CPP)： It is the net pressure gradient between the force facilitating brain-blood flow (mean arterial pressure) and\n删除3：<u>Figure 28-2.Effect of Pao， and Paco， on CPP and ICP.</u>\n\n【31】the force impeding flow (ICP). Cerebral perfusion pressure is directly related to cerebral blood flow. CPP must be maintained within narrow limits， because too little pressure could cause brain tissue to become ischemic or too much could raise intracranial pressure (ICP). CPP is normally between 70 and90 mm Hg in an adult human， and should not fall below 70 mm Hg for a sus-tainedperiod. Some authorities， however， regard a CPP between 50 to150 mm Hg to be within the normal range for adults since this approximates the range of autoregulation in the normal brain.\n\n【32】Cerebral blood flow is approximately 50 mL/100 g of brain tissue/min. It remains fairly constant over a wide range of pressures， due to autoregulation. However， outside the bounds of autoregulation， cerebral blood flow changes according to the cerebral perfusion pressure.\n\n【33】CMRO ： Cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen is coupled with CBF. When the metabolic rate in a particular region increases， CBF to that region will also increase. Increase in CMRO， increases CBF globally. Factors that increase CMRO， are hyperthermia， seizures， and some anesthetic agents. Some inhala-tional agents can cause uncoupling of CBF and CMRO。 that is， though they do reduce the CMRO， the CBF remains unchanged or is even increased by cerebral vasodilatation.\n\n【34】CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【35】The SOL may cause seizures and other neurologic deficits， depending on its size and location. Often， the normal physiologic mechanisms which offset day-to-day increases in intracranial volume， such as displacing cerebrospinal fluid from the brain， will have been exhausted. Thus， patients with SOLs have a reduced intracranial compliance， meaningtthat even smalliincreasesin intracranial volume result in large increases in ICP. As ICP increases， the level of consciousness may be compromised， and the brain’s anatomy distorted. Pressure on the brainstem can lead to herniation of the brainstem and death.\n\n【36】Preoperative Evaluation\n\n【37】In addition to the usual preoperative evaluation， patients with brain tumors warrant special examination of their neurological status. Neurological deficits may be new in onset， and/or changing. Clinical signs and symptoms of an ele-vated ICPare headache， vomiting， blurred vision， somnolence， and papilledema. The signs of impending brain herniation include bradyarrhythmia， hypertension， ipsilateral fixed dilated pupil (from oculomotor and abducent nerve palsy)， and contralateral hemiparesis or hemiplegia.\n\n【38】A review of the patient's CT scan or MRI is invaluable. It gives an idea of the size and position of the tumor， the extent of cerebral edema， and the possible presence of a midline shift signaling a significantly elevated ICP. The size of the tumor， and proximity to dural venous sinuses can give an idea of possible intra-operative blood loss. Cross-matched blood should be available in the blood bank.\n\n【39】Management of Elevated ICP\n\n【40】The following strategies can be used to lower ICP：\n\n【41】a. Reduction of cerebral blood volume： Hypercarbia and hypoxia profoundly increase cerebral blood volume. So proper airway management is crucial in patients with altered intracranial compliance. Hyperventilation to a mod-erate hypocarbia of a Paco， of 25 to 30 mm Hg produces cerebral vaso-constriction and is very useful in acute reduction of elevated ICP. Excessive hyperventilation should be avoided， since it can cause cerebral vasocon-striction in areas of the brain where blood flow is already compromised by cerebral edema. Hypoxia causes cerebral vasodilatation， and thus an increase in ICP. Again， meticulous attention to control of the airway and ventilation is essential. Venous drainage is facilitated by head elevation and avoiding high intrathoracic pressures.\n\n【42】b. Reduction in brain tissue volume is accomplished by diuretics and steroids. Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic administered in the dose of 0.5 to 2 g/kg body weight. It increases the serum osmolality (305-320 mOsm/L) and thus removes the excess water from the brain. Mannitol increases blood volume acutely， and can thus precipitate volume overload and even heart failure in susceptible individuals.\n\n【43】Furosemide is a loop diuretic which is very effective in reducing ICP alone or when used in combination with mannitol. Furosemide reduces blood volume as well as CSF production.\n\n【44】Steroids appear to be helpful in reducing the edema surrounding a SOL. They are ineffective in reducing edema due to hypoxia or hypercarbia.\n\n【45】c. A reduction of CSF can be achieved by surgical placement of a ventricu-lostomy catheter or a lumbar drain.\n\n【46】Anesthetic Management\n\n【47】It is ideal to have two large-bore peripheral venous accesses and an arterial line. A central line or pulmonary artery catheter is indicated based on the coexist-ing medical conditions， and is not an absolute requirement for supratentorial craniotomies. Excessive sedation from premedications can cause hypercarbia and hypoxia， thus elevating the ICP. Therefore， sedative premedication should be used with caution or avoided all together in patients with elevated ICP. Normal saline is the ideal maintenance fluid. Hypotonic solutions such as Ringer lactate and dextrose containing solutions should be avoided.\n\n【48】Routine intraoperative monitoring and invasive monitoring of arterial pressure is utilized for craniotomies. Central venous pressure monitoring is not routine， and indeed， may either expose the patient to an unnecessary risk of pneumothorax， or impede venous drainage from the neck. Moreover， placing a patient with altered intracranial compliance in Trendelenburg for line placement could also cause a dangerous increase in ICP. The one situation 删除换行 where a central venous catheter is indicated is during craniotomies in the sitting position， where the head is higher than the heart. In this position， there is a risk of venous air embolism potentially necessitating the aspiration of air through a central venous catheter to prevent its entry into the pul-monary circulation. The risk of venous air embolism is relatively low with supratentorial tumors， provided the tumor is not adhered to large dural venous sinuses.\n\n【49】Induction is typically performed with sodium thiopental， since thiopental reduces CMRO，. However， propofol and etomidate are also suitable for induc-tion. Ketamine should not be used as it increases ICP and CMRO，. Following induction， hyperventilation is established to avoid hypercarbia. Either depo-larizing or (more commonly) nondepolarizing muscle relaxants are used to obtain relaxation for intubation. Succinylcholine does minimally increase ICP， but when administered after an induction agent， this elevation does not appear to be clinically significant. Succinylcholine should be avoided in patients with motor deficit because of the risk of hyperkalemia from neuronal depolarization.\n\n【50】Narcotics do not directly affect ICP unless patients are breathing sponta-neously， and they are quite useful to help blunt the response to laryngoscopy and intubation. Blunting this response is one of the crucial goals of induction， since patients with a SOL may already have a reduced intracranial compli-ance， and increases in arterial pressure can further increase ICP. The events that cause most intense pressor response are laryngoscopy and intubation， the placement of pins (which hold the head)， the skin incision， and stimulation of the periosteum. Fentanyl， lidocaine， additional doses of the induction agent， and moderate hypocarbia aid in avoiding any rapid increases in cere-bral blood flow which may result. Remifentanil， an ultrashort-acting opioid， can be also used as an infusion from induction to extubation. Long-acting opioids are best avoided. Before the dura is opened， it is essential to optimize operating conditions and to avoid a “tight” or “full\" brain from cerebral edema， or an excess of cerebral blood flow. This can be accomplished by mod-erate hyperventilation in combination with the administration of mannitol， furosemide， and steroids.\n\n【51】Low concentrations of a potent inhalational agent can be added to an oxygen/nitrous oxide mixture for maintenance of anesthesia. Though nitrous oxide reduces the concentration of inhalational agents required to maintain anesthesia， recent evidence， though controversial， suggests that it increases CMRO。 though this effect is blocked by hyperventilation. On the other hand， inhalational agents attenuate autoregulation， and in high concentrations increase cerebral blood flow. Ideally， after establishing mod-erate hypocarbia a low dose of an inhalational agent or propofol infusion are used to maintain anesthesia. Muscle relaxation and moderate hyper-ventilation to an end-tidal CO， concentration of 25 to 30 is continued during the craniotomy.\n\n【52】Hyperglycemia increases intracellular acidosis and facilitates cell ischemia. Therefore， hyperglycemia should be treated aggressively with insulin as required， and glucose-containing solutions should be avoided. Steroids can also contribute to hyperglycemia.\n\n【53】Elevations in blood pressure can cause an intracranial bleed at the surgical site requiring re-exploration. At the time of extubation， hypertension， cough-ing， and straining are to be avoided at all costs. Intravenous lidocaine has been used to prevent the stress responses to extubation. A short-acting opiate， such as remifentanil， can suppress the cough response and facilitates a smooth wakeup. In addition， autoregulation is impaired in areas with cerebral edema. Therefore， blood pressure is carefully controlled， the head elevated， and the patient is extubated awake.\n\n【54】Patients post craniotomy are monitored overnight in an intensive care setting. Periodic assessment of mental status and motor function is essential to detect any changes in neurological status， and blood pressure is meticulously controlled in the immediate postoperative period. Any acute deterioration in mental status， or a new onset neurologic deficit suggests worsening cerebral edema or an intracranial bleed and requires an immediate intervention including urgent CT scan and possible repeat craniotomy to evacuate an hematoma.\n\n【55】Special Considerations for a Posterior Fossa Craniotomy\n\n【56】Posterior fossa tumors present a special challenge. The tumors can compress the cerebellum， the lower cranial nerves， and the vasomotor and respira-tory centers. Involvement of the lower cranial nerves， the glossopharyn-geal and vagusCcan causevasomotor instability. Indeed， surgical dissections in this area can be associated with arrhythmias and alterations in vasomotor tone. Damage to the glossopharyngeal nerve can impair gag reflex and impair a patient's ability to protect his airway. Prior to extuba-tion， the ability to protect airway and adequacy of spontaneous breathing should be established.\n\n【57】The sitting position is sometimes required to access a SOL in the posterior fossa， such as an acoustic neuroma. The risk of venous air embolism is signif-icant in sitting position， since the subdural venous pressure is much lower than the atmospheric pressure. These patients often benefit from a precordial Doppler or even a transesophageal echocardiogram as an additional monitor to detect the occurrence and/or severity of a venous air embolism (VAE). Intravascular air is suggested by sudden hemodynamic instability， or a sudden drop in the end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration. These patients benefit from placement of a multiorifice central lumen catheter， which may be used to aspirate venous air from the right atrium. As the sitting position is fraught with risks， modified supine position or prone position is preferable when possible.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【28】", "content": "【0】Case 28\n\n【1】A 51-year-old man with a tempero-parietal metastatic melanoma pres-ents for left craniotomy and tumor excision.

Be able to describe an anesthetic plan for craniotomy.\n\n【17】Considerations\n\n【18】This patient has a SOL with a midline shift and new onset of a neurological deficit. He is receiving medical management for the cerebral edema and elevated\n\n【19】ICP. The preoperative assessment of this patient includes knowledge of the size and site of lesion and its vascularity. This information can be obtained by physical examination and evaluating the radiological images and medical record.\n\n【20】The goal of the anesthetic is to avoid any further increase in ICP. Further increases in ICP can worsen the cerebral edema and midline shift， and contribute to worsening of the neurologic deficit. Invasive blood pressure monitoring is required. However， in this case， the elevation of ICP is not severe enough to require intraoperative ICP monitoring.\n\n【21】General anesthesia is induced with thiopental or propofol， and muscle relaxation can be achieved with vecuronium. After endotracheal intubation， anesthesia is maintained with nitrous oxide/oxygen and low concentrations of an inhalational agent. A nicardipine infusion is used to treat hypertension， and fentanyl is administered for pain control.\n\n【22】The anesthetic technique is also designed to actively reduce ICP and maintain cerebral perfusion. The careful control of blood pressure， moderate hyperventilation， and use of diuretics such as furosemide and mannitol help to reduce the ICP. To minimize bleeding at the surgical site， the patient is extubated with minimal coughing and bucking， and strict control of blood pressure is maintained during emergence.\n\n【23】This patient will be monitored postoperatively in an intensive care setting to ensure the strict control of blood pressure and periodic assessment of men-tal status and motor function. Any acute deterioration in mental status or a new onset neurodeficit suggests a worsening of the cerebral edema or an intracranial bleed and must be addressed immediately.\n\n【24】Craniotomy for Brain Mass Excision\n\n【25】DEFINITIONS\n\n【26】ICP： Normal ICP is 5 to 15 mm Hg and reflects the relationship between the rigid cranial vault and its contents； that is， the brain， blood， and the CSF Sustained ICP of 15 to 20 mm Hg is considered elevated ICP.\n\n【27】CEREBRAL COMPLIANCE： When intracranial volume increases such as with a SOL， one of the other components (eg， CSF) is initially displaced， and ICP remains relatively normal. But as these “buffering mechanisms\"are exhausted and intracranial volume continues to increase， intracranialpressure then increases as well potentially resulting in brainstem herniation .\n\n【28】CEREBRAL AUTOREGULATION： Autoregulation maintains2aconstant level of cerebral blood flow (CBF) over a wide range of mean arterial pressures. Autoregulation is impaired by cerebral edema， brain injury， and inhaled\n删除3：<u>Figure 28-1.Pressure-volume compliance curve.</u>\n\n【29】anesthetics. The autoregulatory curve is shifted to the right in patients with systemic hypertension. Hypercarbia and hypoxia can increase cerebral blood flow irrespective of autoregulation.\n\n【30】CEREBRAL PERFUSION PRESSURE (CPP)： It is the net pressure gradient between the force facilitating brain-blood flow (mean arterial pressure) and\n删除3：<u>Figure 28-2.Effect of Pao， and Paco， on CPP and ICP.</u>\n\n【31】the force impeding flow (ICP). Cerebral perfusion pressure is directly related to cerebral blood flow. CPP must be maintained within narrow limits， because too little pressure could cause brain tissue to become ischemic or too much could raise intracranial pressure (ICP). CPP is normally between 70 and90 mm Hg in an adult human， and should not fall below 70 mm Hg for a sus-tainedperiod. Some authorities， however， regard a CPP between 50 to150 mm Hg to be within the normal range for adults since this approximates the range of autoregulation in the normal brain.\n\n【32】Cerebral blood flow is approximately 50 mL/100 g of brain tissue/min. It remains fairly constant over a wide range of pressures， due to autoregulation. However， outside the bounds of autoregulation， cerebral blood flow changes according to the cerebral perfusion pressure.\n\n【33】CMRO ： Cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen is coupled with CBF. When the metabolic rate in a particular region increases， CBF to that region will also increase. Increase in CMRO， increases CBF globally. Factors that increase CMRO， are hyperthermia， seizures， and some anesthetic agents. Some inhala-tional agents can cause uncoupling of CBF and CMRO。 that is， though they do reduce the CMRO， the CBF remains unchanged or is even increased by cerebral vasodilatation.\n\n【34】CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【35】The SOL may cause seizures and other neurologic deficits， depending on its size and location. Often， the normal physiologic mechanisms which offset day-to-day increases in intracranial volume， such as displacing cerebrospinal fluid from the brain， will have been exhausted. Thus， patients with SOLs have a reduced intracranial compliance， meaningtthat even smalliincreasesin intracranial volume result in large increases in ICP. As ICP increases， the level of consciousness may be compromised， and the brain’s anatomy distorted. Pressure on the brainstem can lead to herniation of the brainstem and death.\n\n【36】Preoperative Evaluation\n\n【37】In addition to the usual preoperative evaluation， patients with brain tumors warrant special examination of their neurological status. Neurological deficits may be new in onset， and/or changing. Clinical signs and symptoms of an ele-vated ICPare headache， vomiting， blurred vision， somnolence， and papilledema. The signs of impending brain herniation include bradyarrhythmia， hypertension， ipsilateral fixed dilated pupil (from oculomotor and abducent nerve palsy)， and contralateral hemiparesis or hemiplegia.\n\n【38】A review of the patient's CT scan or MRI is invaluable. It gives an idea of the size and position of the tumor， the extent of cerebral edema， and the possible presence of a midline shift signaling a significantly elevated ICP. The size of the tumor， and proximity to dural venous sinuses can give an idea of possible intra-operative blood loss. Cross-matched blood should be available in the blood bank.\n\n【39】Management of Elevated ICP\n\n【40】The following strategies can be used to lower ICP：\n\n【41】a. Reduction of cerebral blood volume： Hypercarbia and hypoxia profoundly increase cerebral blood volume. So proper airway management is crucial in patients with altered intracranial compliance. Hyperventilation to a mod-erate hypocarbia of a Paco， of 25 to 30 mm Hg produces cerebral vaso-constriction and is very useful in acute reduction of elevated ICP. Excessive hyperventilation should be avoided， since it can cause cerebral vasocon-striction in areas of the brain where blood flow is already compromised by cerebral edema. Hypoxia causes cerebral vasodilatation， and thus an increase in ICP. Again， meticulous attention to control of the airway and ventilation is essential. Venous drainage is facilitated by head elevation and avoiding high intrathoracic pressures.\n\n【42】b. Reduction in brain tissue volume is accomplished by diuretics and steroids. Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic administered in the dose of 0.5 to 2 g/kg body weight. It increases the serum osmolality (305-320 mOsm/L) and thus removes the excess water from the brain. Mannitol increases blood volume acutely， and can thus precipitate volume overload and even heart failure in susceptible individuals.\n\n【43】Furosemide is a loop diuretic which is very effective in reducing ICP alone or when used in combination with mannitol. Furosemide reduces blood volume as well as CSF production.\n\n【44】Steroids appear to be helpful in reducing the edema surrounding a SOL. They are ineffective in reducing edema due to hypoxia or hypercarbia.\n\n【45】c. A reduction of CSF can be achieved by surgical placement of a ventricu-lostomy catheter or a lumbar drain.\n\n【46】Anesthetic Management\n\n【47】It is ideal to have two large-bore peripheral venous accesses and an arterial line. A central line or pulmonary artery catheter is indicated based on the coexist-ing medical conditions， and is not an absolute requirement for supratentorial craniotomies. Excessive sedation from premedications can cause hypercarbia and hypoxia， thus elevating the ICP. Therefore， sedative premedication should be used with caution or avoided all together in patients with elevated ICP. Normal saline is the ideal maintenance fluid. Hypotonic solutions such as Ringer lactate and dextrose containing solutions should be avoided.\n\n【48】Routine intraoperative monitoring and invasive monitoring of arterial pressure is utilized for craniotomies. Central venous pressure monitoring is not routine， and indeed， may either expose the patient to an unnecessary risk of pneumothorax， or impede venous drainage from the neck. Moreover， placing a patient with altered intracranial compliance in Trendelenburg for line placement could also cause a dangerous increase in ICP. The one situation 删除换行 where a central venous catheter is indicated is during craniotomies in the sitting position， where the head is higher than the heart. In this position， there is a risk of venous air embolism potentially necessitating the aspiration of air through a central venous catheter to prevent its entry into the pul-monary circulation. The risk of venous air embolism is relatively low with supratentorial tumors， provided the tumor is not adhered to large dural venous sinuses.\n\n【49】Induction is typically performed with sodium thiopental， since thiopental reduces CMRO，. However， propofol and etomidate are also suitable for induc-tion. Ketamine should not be used as it increases ICP and CMRO，. Following induction， hyperventilation is established to avoid hypercarbia.

Succinylcholine should be avoided in patients with motor deficit because of the risk of hyperkalemia from neuronal depolarization.\n\n【50】Narcotics do not directly affect ICP unless patients are breathing sponta-neously， and they are quite useful to help blunt the response to laryngoscopy and intubation. Blunting this response is one of the crucial goals of induction， since patients with a SOL may already have a reduced intracranial compli-ance， and increases in arterial pressure can further increase ICP. The events that cause most intense pressor response are laryngoscopy and intubation， the placement of pins (which hold the head)， the skin incision， and stimulation of the periosteum.

Venous drainage is facilitated by head elevation and avoiding high intrathoracic pressures.\n\n【42】b. Reduction in brain tissue volume is accomplished by diuretics and steroids. Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic administered in the dose of 0.5 to 2 g/kg body weight. It increases the serum osmolality (305-320 mOsm/L) and thus removes the excess water from the brain. Mannitol increases blood volume acutely， and can thus precipitate volume overload and even heart failure in susceptible individuals.\n\n【43】Furosemide is a loop diuretic which is very effective in reducing ICP alone or when used in combination with mannitol. Furosemide reduces blood volume as well as CSF production.\n\n【44】Steroids appear to be helpful in reducing the edema surrounding a SOL. They are ineffective in reducing edema due to hypoxia or hypercarbia.\n\n【45】c. A reduction of CSF can be achieved by surgical placement of a ventricu-lostomy catheter or a lumbar drain.\n\n【46】Anesthetic Management\n\n【47】It is ideal to have two large-bore peripheral venous accesses and an arterial line. A central line or pulmonary artery catheter is indicated based on the coexist-ing medical conditions， and is not an absolute requirement for supratentorial craniotomies. Excessive sedation from premedications can cause hypercarbia and hypoxia， thus elevating the ICP. Therefore， sedative premedication should be used with caution or avoided all together in patients with elevated ICP. Normal saline is the ideal maintenance fluid. Hypotonic solutions such as Ringer lactate and dextrose containing solutions should be avoided.\n\n【48】Routine intraoperative monitoring and invasive monitoring of arterial pressure is utilized for craniotomies. Central venous pressure monitoring is not routine， and indeed， may either expose the patient to an unnecessary risk of pneumothorax， or impede venous drainage from the neck. Moreover， placing a patient with altered intracranial compliance in Trendelenburg for line placement could also cause a dangerous increase in ICP. The one situation 删除换行 where a central venous catheter is indicated is during craniotomies in the sitting position， where the head is higher than the heart. In this position， there is a risk of venous air embolism potentially necessitating the aspiration of air through a central venous catheter to prevent its entry into the pul-monary circulation. The risk of venous air embolism is relatively low with supratentorial tumors， provided the tumor is not adhered to large dural venous sinuses.\n\n【49】Induction is typically performed with sodium thiopental， since thiopental reduces CMRO，. However， propofol and etomidate are also suitable for induc-tion. Ketamine should not be used as it increases ICP and CMRO，. Following induction， hyperventilation is established to avoid hypercarbia. Either depo-larizing or (more commonly) nondepolarizing muscle relaxants are used to obtain relaxation for intubation. Succinylcholine does minimally increase ICP， but when administered after an induction agent， this elevation does not appear to be clinically significant. Succinylcholine should be avoided in patients with motor deficit because of the risk of hyperkalemia from neuronal depolarization.\n\n【50】Narcotics do not directly affect ICP unless patients are breathing sponta-neously， and they are quite useful to help blunt the response to laryngoscopy and intubation. Blunting this response is one of the crucial goals of induction， since patients with a SOL may already have a reduced intracranial compli-ance， and increases in arterial pressure can further increase ICP. The events that cause most intense pressor response are laryngoscopy and intubation， the placement of pins (which hold the head)， the skin incision， and stimulation of the periosteum. Fentanyl， lidocaine， additional doses of the induction agent， and moderate hypocarbia aid in avoiding any rapid increases in cere-bral blood flow which may result. Remifentanil， an ultrashort-acting opioid， can be also used as an infusion from induction to extubation. Long-acting opioids are best avoided. Before the dura is opened， it is essential to optimize operating conditions and to avoid a “tight” or “full\" brain from cerebral edema， or an excess of cerebral blood flow. This can be accomplished by mod-erate hyperventilation in combination with the administration of mannitol， furosemide， and steroids.\n\n【51】Low concentrations of a potent inhalational agent can be added to an oxygen/nitrous oxide mixture for maintenance of anesthesia. Though nitrous oxide reduces the concentration of inhalational agents required to maintain anesthesia， recent evidence， though controversial， suggests that it increases CMRO。 though this effect is blocked by hyperventilation. On the other hand， inhalational agents attenuate autoregulation， and in high concentrations increase cerebral blood flow. Ideally， after establishing mod-erate hypocarbia a low dose of an inhalational agent or propofol infusion are used to maintain anesthesia. Muscle relaxation and moderate hyper-ventilation to an end-tidal CO， concentration of 25 to 30 is continued during the craniotomy.\n\n【52】Hyperglycemia increases intracellular acidosis and facilitates cell ischemia. Therefore， hyperglycemia should be treated aggressively with insulin as required， and glucose-containing solutions should be avoided. Steroids can also contribute to hyperglycemia.\n\n【53】Elevations in blood pressure can cause an intracranial bleed at the surgical site requiring re-exploration. At the time of extubation， hypertension， cough-ing， and straining are to be avoided at all costs. Intravenous lidocaine has been used to prevent the stress responses to extubation. A short-acting opiate， such as remifentanil， can suppress the cough response and facilitates a smooth wakeup. In addition， autoregulation is impaired in areas with cerebral edema. Therefore， blood pressure is carefully controlled， the head elevated， and the patient is extubated awake.\n\n【54】Patients post craniotomy are monitored overnight in an intensive care setting. Periodic assessment of mental status and motor function is essential to detect any changes in neurological status， and blood pressure is meticulously controlled in the immediate postoperative period. Any acute deterioration in mental status， or a new onset neurologic deficit suggests worsening cerebral edema or an intracranial bleed and requires an immediate intervention including urgent CT scan and possible repeat craniotomy to evacuate an hematoma.\n\n【55】Special Considerations for a Posterior Fossa Craniotomy\n\n【56】Posterior fossa tumors present a special challenge. The tumors can compress the cerebellum， the lower cranial nerves， and the vasomotor and respira-tory centers. Involvement of the lower cranial nerves， the glossopharyn-geal and vagusCcan causevasomotor instability. Indeed， surgical dissections in this area can be associated with arrhythmias and alterations in vasomotor tone. Damage to the glossopharyngeal nerve can impair gag reflex and impair a patient's ability to protect his airway. Prior to extuba-tion， the ability to protect airway and adequacy of spontaneous breathing should be established.\n\n【57】The sitting position is sometimes required to access a SOL in the posterior fossa， such as an acoustic neuroma. The risk of venous air embolism is signif-icant in sitting position， since the subdural venous pressure is much lower than the atmospheric pressure. These patients often benefit from a precordial Doppler or even a transesophageal echocardiogram as an additional monitor to detect the occurrence and/or severity of a venous air embolism (VAE). Intravascular air is suggested by sudden hemodynamic instability， or a sudden drop in the end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration. These patients benefit from placement of a multiorifice central lumen catheter， which may be used to aspirate venous air from the right atrium. As the sitting position is fraught with risks， modified supine position or prone position is preferable when possible.", "index": 6238, "show": true, "start": 6225, "end": 6229, "province": ["格式规范性", "多余换行"], "isEdit": false, "comment": "30和31为同段"}], "startTime": "2024/09/12 11:36:34", "endTime": "2024/09/12 11:37:57", "cost": 82.276}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:32", "update_time": "2024-09-11 19:37:57", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 19:36:34"}

As the left ventricle fails in its ability to pump blood forward into the systemic circulation, it increases venous congestion within the pulmonary circulation. As the pulmonary venous congestion increases, it decreases the ability to achieve adequate oxygen exchange. Specifically, as the hydrostatic pressure within pulmonary vessels increases, it forces fluid to leave the vascular bed and cross into the interstitial space and then into the alveoli. This then inhibits oxygen exchange and contributes to the patient’s sense of being short of air (SOA) and dyspnea on exertion (DOE). As HF worsens, the shortness of air can progress to orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND), and dyspnea at rest 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>, and a progressive dry cough may develop especially when the patient is recumbent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. In addition, the patient may note an increase in fatigue as the HF progresses. Physical assessment findings that parallel these symptoms include a drop in oxygen saturation (SaO <sub>2 </sub> ), the presence of bilateral crackles or adventitious breath sounds, dullness to percussion noting a possible pleural effusion, and the evidence of pulmonary congestion on chest X-ray. In addition, as the left ventricle becomes less compliant, S3 and/or S4 may be heard. An S3 may be heard during the passive flow of blood from the left atrium into the left ventricle, and an S4 may be heard when the left atrium contracts or during “atrial kick.” When both S3 and S4 are heard it is called a summation gallop. The dilation of the left ventricle from the increase in preload and hypertrophy of the myocardium related to the increase in SVR may be evident on chest X-ray as cardiomegaly and on 12 Lead ECG as left ventricular hypertrophy.\n\n【2】As venous congestion within the pulmonary circulation increases, it increases the pressure within the pulmonary bed itself, which increases the workload on the right ventricle. As the right ventricle begins to fail, the venous congestion is reflected back into the general venous circulation. While the venous circulation is a high capacitance system and it can handle an increase in volume with little change in pressure, eventually the increase in venous congestion produces venous distension within the liver and the portal veins and lower extremities. Physical examination then begins to note an elevated CVP and an increase in JVD, liver enlargement or hepatomegaly, ascites, and dependent edema. As the volume within the liver increases, pressing on the liver may produce a rise in the JVD by 1 cm or greater which is called a positive hepatojugular reflux 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Other patient symptoms that reflect HF are the increase in fluid retention noting that a 2.2 pound increase in weight reflects 1 L of retained fluid, and a decrease in perfusion to the gastrointestinal track may produce symptoms of abdominal distention and pain and anorexia.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 11:36:18", "endTime": "2024/09/12 11:36:32", "cost": 13.815}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:32", "update_time": "2024-09-11 19:36:32", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 19:36:18"}

Her pain is relieved after eating food, and she has experienced weight gain. What is the most likely primary treatment for this patient?\n\n【1】> (A) Amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and omeprazole\n\n【2】> (B) Avoidance of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\n\n【3】> (C) Gastrinoma resection\n\n【4】> (D) Metoclopramide\n\n【5】> (E) Ranitidine\n\n【6】 Answer: The correct answer is A . This patient is likely suffering from a duodenal ulcer. Helicobacter pylori is the most common cause of duodenal and gastric ulcers (involved in 100% and 70% of lesions, respectively). It can be diagnosed with esophagogastroduodenoscopy or a urease breath test. A key distinction between these two ulcers is that eating food often relieves duodenal ulcer pain and patients tend to report resulting weight gain. Duodenal ulcer symptoms are exacerbated when acid is secreted without any food to act as a buffer, causing pain on an empty stomach. The standard first-line therapy is one-week triple therapy consisting of the antibiotics amoxicillin and clarithromycin, and a proton pump inhibitor such as omeprazole.  \n\n【7】Answer B is incorrect . NSAIDs are the second leading cause of both gastric and duodenal ulcers, but are more commonly associated with gastric ulcers. Unlike duodenal ulcers, gastric ulcers are worsened by food; patients usually complain of resulting early satiety and weight loss. Although NSAIDs should be avoided, this would not be a primary part of the treatment plan for this patient with confirmed Helicobacter pylori infection.  \n\n【8】Answer C is incorrect . Patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome have gastrin-secreting tumors of the pancreas and duodenum. They will have findings indicative of acid hypersecretion, such as several refractory ulcers. It is associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1). Although this syndrome can result in a duodenal ulcer, the question stem makes no mention of other tumors associated with MEN-1 (pituitary adenoma, parathyroid adenoma), and does not indicate that the patient has an elevated serum gastrin. Thus, the patient’s pathology is more likely due to Helicobacter pylori infection.  \n\n【9】Answer D is incorrect . Metoclopramide is used primarily as an anti-emetic and a prokinetic agent. It would not be first-line therapy for a patient with a duodenal ulcer.  \n\n【10】Answer E is incorrect . Ranitidine is a histamine2 \\-receptor antagonist. It is frequently used as a treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease to reduce the amount of acid in the stomach.

A 37-week, appropriate for gestational age, male infant is successfully delivered. After routine resuscitation by the neonatologist, the infant is well appearing as is the new mother. For teaching purposes and per policy, you have requested that the placenta be sent to pathology for evaluation of placental abruption. The infant and mother are discharged home routinely after 4 days. One week later, you receive the report from pathology, which confirms the presence of a small, retroplacental hemorrhage. However, the report goes on to describe increased syncytial knots, villous agglutination, distal villous hypoplasia, and intervillous fibrin, findings which are consistent with placental underperfusion. A literature search suggests that these findings may be associated with short- and long-term neurodevelopmental impairments in premature infants. At the mother’s next follow-up visit, she shares her concerns that the serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) she took throughout pregnancy, her pre-eclampsia, or perhaps the surgical anesthetics used during the delivery may negatively impact her son’s development. She states that she began sharing these concerns with her son’s pediatrician at the 2-week visit but stopped because the pediatrician seemed very busy. You are unsure whether to disclose the pathology results with the mother, specifically the findings consistent with underperfusion, because you are concerned about potentially contributing to her anxiety about her infant son or worsening her depressive symptoms.\n\n【3】 What is your ethical and/or legal obligation to disclose the pathology results to the patient?\n\n【4】 When, if ever, is it appropriate to withhold medical information from a patient?\n\n【5】 When, if ever, is it appropriate to deceive a patient?\n\n【6】### ANSWERS TO CASE 17:\n\n【7】#### Deception to Patients\n\n【8】Summary : A 27-year-old primigravida mother with generalized anxiety disorder, dysthymia, and pre-eclampsia is worried that her full-term, healthy appearing newborn son may suffer negative neurodevelopmental consequences as a result of any one of numerous risk factors. The placental pathology report describes findings consistent with placental underperfusion, a condition that may be associated with neurodevelopmental impairments in premature infants. You are unsure whether to disclose these results with her due to concerns over her mental health.\n\n【9】 Ethical and/or legal obligation to disclose the pathology results to the patient : Ethically, the pathology results should be disclosed based on the ethical principle of respect for autonomy. Legally, the physician should disclose all clinically relevant information that a “reasonable person” would want in making a medical decision.\n\n【10】 When, if ever, is it appropriate to withhold medical information from a patient? Information may be withheld where the physician believes the information may harm the patient (therapeutic privilege).\n\n【11】 When, if ever, is it appropriate to deceive a patient? It is never permissible to deceive a patient.\n\n【12】### ANALYSIS\n\n【13】##### Objectives\n\n【14】1\\. Understand the ethical principles that generate the obligation to veracity (truth telling).\n\n【15】2\\. Understand the ethical principles that may justify withholding information from the patient.\n\n【16】3\\. Identify criteria necessary to justify deception.\n\n【17】##### Considerations\n\n【18】This 27-year-old first-time mother has a generalized anxiety disorder for which she receives treatment in the form of an SSRI. Due to concerns for placental abruption, you ordered and have received the pathology report on the placenta. In addition to confirming a small abruption, the pathologist mentions findings consistent with placental underperfusion, which may be associated with adverse neurologic outcomes in premature infants. This finding is of questionable significance to your patient, because these results are not conclusive and relate specifically to premature newborns. Conversely, you suspect that no studies have been performed that look at this association in term newborns; it may be appropriate to say that the literature can neither prove nor disprove the association with neurodevelopmental impairments in term newborns. It is also possible that the findings of placental abruption and of underperfusion are related to your patient’s pre-eclampsia. Your patient voices her concerns to you about her newborn son’s long-term neurodevelopment, citing her medication use, the use of anesthetic medications during her cesarean delivery, and her pre-eclampsia as possible risk factors. She has tried to discuss her concerns with her son’s pediatrician, but she remains unconvinced by the pediatrician’s reassurances. Because you have observed that the infant appears healthy, it would be appropriate to investigate why she is concerned about her son, for example, has she observed anything about his behavior that led her to worry about his neurodevelopment?\n\n【19】In a patient with a known mood disorder in the setting of a major life stressor, it would be appropriate to screen her for depression using an appropriate screening tool. In accordance with the ethical principle of nonmaleficence, you wish to avoid full disclosure of the pathology results. You are concerned that disclosing this information to this anxious-appearing, first-time mother may increase her level of anxiety, leading to emotional or psychological issues, and potentially exposing her son to future medical procedures. You are also concerned that she may believe that her pre-eclampsia led to the findings described in the pathology report and that disclosure of this information will lead to her feeling guilty, triggering a worsening of her depressive symptoms that could potentially lead to a major depressive episode. However, you are afraid that not revealing this information constitutes a form of deception, violating your obligation to veracity, which is rooted in the principle of respect for patient autonomy. An ethically rigorous and empirically justified process by which to weigh these competing claims is necessary to make a morally justifiable choice and to act on it.\n\n【20】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【21】#### Truth Telling and Withholding Information\n\n【22】### DEFINITIONS\n\n【23】DECEIVE : To intentionally cause another person to believe what is false. Deception is the act of doing so.\n\n【24】LIE/LYING : To make a believed false statement to another person with the intention that he or she believes the statement to be true.\n\n【25】PATERNALISM : Intentionally overriding a person’s known preferences or actions with the goal of benefitting or avoiding harm to the person whose preferences or actions are overridden.\n\n【26】THERAPEUTIC PRIVILEGE : A justification used to withhold information from patients with the belief that disclosing such information would cause the patient very grave harm.\n\n【27】VERACITY : The principle of truth telling and the duty to avoid deception in patient interactions.\n\n【28】### CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【29】##### Ethical and Legal Considerations\n\n【30】There are 4 principles that form the framework of medical ethics: beneficence, nonmaleficence, justice, and respect for autonomy . No principle is superior to the others; rather, all 4 must be considered to evaluate the ethical appropriateness of an action. From the interplay of these four principles, secondary principles, standards, patient rights, rules, and codes of conduct are derived which help guide the practice of medicine.\n删除4：<u>Table 17–1 • PRINCIPLES OF MEDICAL ETHICS</u>\n\n【31】In this case, the physician’s obligation to veracity primarily stems from the principle of respect for autonomy. For a patient to act autonomously, he or she must be able to make meaningful decisions in regard to his or her present and future health. To do so, the patient must have relevant and accurate information. This creates an obligation on the part of the physician to provide that information. Furthermore, it can be argued that withholding information may negatively impact the patient if the withholding of information results in a negative consequence or prevents a positive outcome—a line of reasoning supported by the principles of nonmaleficence and beneficence, respectively.\n\n【32】The law reflects establishing the right to informed consent wherein the patient has a right to all relevant information needed to make an informed choice and should be free of any undue influence or coercion. Two different legal standards are commonly used to decide what information is “relevant” and, thus, must be disclosed. The first is the “reasonable person” standard, whereby a physician must disclose all medical information, which a “reasonable person” would be expected to want when making medical decisions. However, empiric ethics research reveals that physicians grossly underestimate the amount of information that their patients want, while patients assign a higher degree of relevance to their medical information. Patient preference for disclosure persists even after being counseled about the questionable clinical significance of the information. These empiric data obligate physicians to err on the side of greater disclosure or to have explicit discussions with their patients about the types of information they desire. Furthermore, when the physician fails to give the patient all relevant information regarding a procedure, the patient’s ability to give informed consent is precluded.\n\n【33】Should the physician go on to perform a procedure without consent, this is an assault on the patient, which is considered to be another violation of the patient’s autonomy. To account for these shortcomings, a second “subjective” standard was developed, wherein the physician must disclose all information considered “material” or “significant” to the decision-making process of the particular person or patient. Although obstacles to a patient obtaining the desired information may remain, this standard puts the burden on the physician to assess his or her patient’s desired level of disclosure.\n\n【34】The most common justification for nondisclosure is the concept of therapeutic privilege, which holds that a physician (or other medical practitioner) may at, his or her discretion, withhold medical information from a patient (as this information relates to the diagnosis, prognosis, treatment options, and risks associated with these options) if, in his or her opinion, the information would harm the patient or would then leave him or her unable to make rational decisions. The justification for this paternalistic act is derived primarily from the principle of nonmaleficence, the goal of which is to avoid harm to the patient. The inherent conflict of therapeutic privilege with the principle of respect necessitates that the physician who relies on it to justify nondisclosure of information to his or her patient and he or she must do so after a rigorous analysis of the moral appropriateness of the decision. A successful justification must rely on specific facets of the case, because this is necessary to counter the default obligation to full disclosure. Conversely, the justification must be limited to the specific case, so as to not provide a “blanket justification” to be used to justify nondisclosure in seemingly similar but critically different scenarios. To do so, the physician must take into account the patient’s psychological state. It would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to argue that a patient without a psychiatric disturbance (either chronic or acute) would be exposed to sufficient harm from full disclosure so as to outweigh the violation of their autonomy and the potential benefits of full knowledge of his or her disease and the potential treatment options. Five potential reasons have been suggested by Richard and colleagues for when to resort to the use of therapeutic privilege. These are as follows:\n\n【35】1\\. To allow the patient to come to terms with events, both factually and emotionally.\n\n【36】2\\. To prevent decision-making at a time of relative incapacity precipitated by overwhelming anxiety or stress.\n\n【37】3\\. To prevent physical or psychological harm (eg, prevent severe psychological stress).\n\n【38】4\\. To preserve hope.\n\n【39】5\\. To maintain the patient’s long-term autonomy.\n\n【40】These reasons must still be weighed against violating the patient’s short-term autonomy and the potential consequences thereof in order to weigh the moral appropriateness of a decision to violate the patient’s autonomy . The algorithm in Figure 17–1 has been slightly modified for purposes of simplicity; it is also worth acknowledging that the algorithm involves subjective reasoning and, thus, may result in reaching a faulty conclusion.\n删除3：<u>Figure 17–1. Algorithm to evaluate moral appropriateness of therapeutic privilege.</u>\n\n【41】The Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs of the American Medical Association (AMA) states that information should never be permanently withheld from patients, because doing so violates the patient’s trust in the physician. Rather, the AMA advocates that beneficence may allow a physician in select circumstances to postpone full disclosure of information to patients whose capacity to make competent medical decisions may be compromised or when disclosure is otherwise medically contraindicated. Delayed disclosure is not justified when a physician merely intends to prevent a patient’s refusal of medically necessary treatments or to instill hope for the future. It is important to note the conflict between the position taken on preserving hope by Richard and colleagues (of French-Canadian nationalities) and the AMA. This difference likely reflects the heightened importance put on respecting patient autonomy in the United States, an importance reflected in the cultural views on rights and in the law. As a result, a practitioner in the United States may choose to be more forthcoming if he or she is considering the preservation of hope as the reason to withhold information from the patient.\n\n【42】In the case described above, the obstetrician should pay close attention to the mother’s emotional and psychological state. Evidence of worsening of her anxiety disorder or the development of depression (eg, postpartum depression) warrants evaluation and treatment. If her psychological symptoms are severe enough at this initial visit, then the obstetrician may consider temporarily delaying a full discussion of the results of the pathology report until her symptoms have improved. At that time, the physician may choose to discuss with the patient how much detail she desires, thus making it possible to discuss the results of the pathology report to the level of detail the patient desires.\n\n【43】###", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 14:01:06", "endTime": "2024/09/12 14:02:05", "cost": 58.071}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:32", "update_time": "2024-09-11 22:02:03", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 22:01:05"}

This  删除换行 weak area lies between the upper oblique fibres (known as \n\n【2】Thyropharyngeus) and the sphincter-like transverse fibres \n\n【3】(known as Cricopharyngeus) of the inferior constrictor muscle  删除换行 of the pharynx. Both these parts of the inferior constrictor  删除换行 muscle of the pharynx have different nerve supplies and  删除换行 functions.\n\n【4】THYROPHARYNGEUS PART.— The fibres of this part  删除换行 of inferior constrictor of pharynx are oblique in direction as  删除换行 the fibres take origin (mainly) from the oblique line of the  删除换行 lamina of the thyroid cartilage and spread backwards and  删除换行 medially and are inserted with the muscle of the opposite  删除换行 side into a fibrous raphe in the posterior midline of the  删除换行 pharynx. Its main nerve supply comes from the pharyngeal  删除换行 branch of the vagus nerve which arises from the upper part  删除换行 of the inferior ganglion of the vagus nerve and consists  删除换行 principally of the fibres from the cranial root of the accessory  删除换行 nerve. The main function of this part of the inferior  删除换行 constrictor muscle is to propel the food following deglutition.\n\n【5】CRICOPHARYNGEUS PART.— The fibres of this part  删除换行 of the inferior constrictor arise from the side of the cricoid  删除换行 cartilage and pass backwards horizontally to be continuous  删除换行 with the fibres of the opposite side and are continuous below  删除换行 with the circular fibres of the oesophagus. This muscle  删除换行 surrounds the narrowest part of the pharynx and acts as the  删除换行 sphincteric part of the muscle. During swallowing the \n\n【6】Cricopharyngeus relaxes so that the bolus of food passes  删除换行 unhindered. Failure of such relaxation will result in an  删除换行 increased pressure within the lower part of the pharynx and  删除换行 will cause herniation of the pharyngeal mucous membrane  删除换行 posteriorly through the weak spot — known as Killian's 删除换行 dehiscence. Such herniation is known as pharyngeal pouch  删除换行 or diverticulum of the pharynx. So it is a pressure diverticulum 删除换行 or pulsion diverticulum of the pharynx which is often miscalled  删除换行 as diverticulum of the oesophagus. The nerve supply of this  删除换行 part of inferior constrictor mainly derives from the recurrent  删除换行 laryngeal nerve and external laryngeal nerve.\n\n【7】The course of the diverticulum.— To start with it is a midline  删除换行 swelling of the posterior aspect of the pharynx. As the  删除换行 diverticulum enlarges in size the resistance of the vertebral  删除换行 column pushes it to the one side or the other, usually to the  删除换行 left side.\n\n【8】GENERAL TREATMENT —\n\n【9】(i) Age.— The sufferers are usually old people.\n\n【10】(ii) Sex.— It is commoner in men at the ratio of 2:1.\n\n【11】The course of the diverticulum can be divided into 3 删除换行 stages for facility of description of clinical features.\n\n【12】STAGE I.— This is the stage of initial bulging and it is  删除换行 symptomless. The pathology can only be detected as an accident  删除换行 during the course of a barium swallow examination for some  删除换行 other purpose. At this stage there is only a small diverticulum  删除换行 in the posterior aspect of the pharynx which has not touched  删除换行 the vertebral column. In only extremely rare cases the patient  删除换行 may complain of a sensation of foreign body in the throat.\n\n【13】STAGE II.— In this stage the diverticulum is larger and  删除换行 more globular but it still lies in the posterior midline, but  删除换行 touches the vertebral column. The main symptoms at this  删除换行 stage are :\n\n【14】(a) Regurgitation of undigested food material at a different  删除换行 time e.g. at the time of turning to one side or the other at  删除换行 night or even during swallowing at the next time of eating.\n\n【15】(b) Such regurgitation may awaken the patient from sleep  删除换行 with a sense of suffocation and violent coughing.\n\n【16】(c) Occasionally abscess of lung may result from  删除换行 regurgitation of food into the air passage.\n\n【17】At this stage operation and excision of the pouch is  删除换行 indicated.\n\n【18】Thyropharyngeus\n\n【19】Pharyngeal\n\n【20】Pouch\n\n【21】Cricopharyngeus\n删除3：<u>Fig.8.16.— Shows how a pharyngeal pouch is formed through the</u>\n\n【22】Killian's dehiscence between the Thyropharyngeus above and Fig.8.17.— Demonstrates the usual position of a swelling caused \n\n【23】Cricopharyngeus below. by the 3rd stage of the pharyngeal pouch.删除27：<u>118 A TEXTBOOK ON SURGICAL SHORT CASES</u>\n\n【24】STAGE III.— In this stage the diverticulum becomes  删除换行 even bigger in size and is pushed to the left side by the  删除换行 vertebral column. The fundus of the pouch becomes  删除换行 dependent and lies in the posterior triangle of the neck. The  删除换行 mouth of the pouch looks horizontally upwards. The main  删除换行 symptoms are :\n\n【25】(a) Symptoms of the second stage persist.\n\n【26】(b) In about l/3rd of cases a swelling is visible in the  删除换行 posterior triangle of the neck and the swelling becomes larger  删除换行 as the patient drinks.\n\n【27】(c) Dysphagia is a main symptom of this stage and in  删除换行 fact many patients come to the clinician only with this  删除换行 symptom. This is due to the fact that the pouch compresses  删除换行 the oesophagus and the dysphagia results.\n\n【28】(d) A gurgling noise may be heard in the neck as the  删除换行 patient swallows.\n\n【29】(e) Due to semi-starvation there is progressive loss of  删除换行 weight and gradually the patient may become cachectic in  删除换行 the long run.\n\n【30】(f) Aspiration of the contents of the pouch may lead to  删除换行 lung abscess, aspiration pneumonia etc.\n\n【31】So in this stage the main complaints are regurgitation,  删除换行 increasing dysphagia and visible swelling in the neck.\n\n【32】The features of the swelling in the neck caused by the  删除换行 3rd stage of pharyngeal pouch are :\n\n【33】(i) Site.— The swelling usually lies in the posterior  删除换行 triangle of the left side. That means such swelling is always  删除换行 posterior to the sternomastoid muscle and in front of the  删除换行 trapezius muscle. This swelling lies usually inferior to the  删除换行 level of the thyroid cartilage as the position of the Killian's  删除换行 dehiscence is below the Thyropharyngeus muscle which  删除换行 corresponds to the level of the thyroid cartilage. This swelling  删除换行 lies deep to the deep cervical fascia, so when the sternomastoid  删除换行 muscle is made taut there is slight decrease in the prominence  删除换行 of the swelling as the deep cervical fascia also becomes taut  删除换行 by that manoeuvre.\n\n【34】(ii) Size and shape.— It is usually globular in shape,  删除换行 but the size varies according to the duration of the swelling.\n\n【35】(iii) Surface is usually smooth and the edge is indistinct.\n\n【36】(iv) Consistency.— It is soft and cystic. It can be reduced. \n\n【37】Fluctuation test is positive, but transillumination test is  删除换行 negative.\n\n【38】(v) Fixity.— This swelling is not mobile and is fixed to  删除换行 the surrounding structures.\n\n【39】SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS.— Two investigations are  删除换行 important in this regard —\n\n【40】1. RADIOGRAPHY.— With a very thin emulsion of  删除换行 barium, barium swallow examination should be performed. \n\n【41】Anteroposterior view may not be very helpful as the barium  删除换行 filled pharyngeal pouch will superimpose on the beginning  删除换行 of the oesophagus and may look like a septum obstructing 删除换行 the commencement of the oesophagus. The best view to  删除换行 diagnose pharyngeal pouch is the semi-lateral view. If the  删除换行 pouch is compressed one will see in the screen the barium  删除换行 to be spilled into the oesophagus. Moreover one can see the  删除换行 overflow of barium emulsion into the oesophagus from the  删除换行 top of the pouch. One may find the fundus of the pouch  删除换行 invading the superior mediastinum.\n\n【42】Chest X-ray is essential to exclude associated lung abscess  删除换行 or aspiration pneumonitis.\n\n【43】2. OESOPHAGOSCOPY.— This investigation is not as  删除换行 necessary as the previous one. It is also dangerous. The  删除换行 instrument may perforate the fundus of the pouch, which is  删除换行 quite thin and fragile.\n\n【44】DRUG DOSAGE CHART FOR ADULTS\n\n【45】In Stage I— operation is not indicated and the  删除换行 diverticulum is almost ignored until and unless the patient  删除换行 comes with more symptoms of stage II.\n\n【46】In Stage II and Stage III — operation is strongly advised  删除换行 and the pharyngeal pouch is excised with cricopharyngeal  删除换行 myotomy (almost similar to Heller's operation).\n\n【47】OPERATION.— Endoscopy is first performed with two  删除换行 ideas —\n\n【48】(i) To pack the pouch with ribbon gauze and (ii) to pass  删除换行 a nasogastric tube into the oesophagus to determine the  删除换行 position of the sac.\n\n【49】Either a transverse incision at the level of the cricoid  删除换行 cartilage is made or an oblique incision along the anterior  删除换行 border of the left sternomastoid muscle is made.\n\n【50】The lateral lobe of the thyroid gland is first mobilised. To  删除换行 do this the superior pole of the thyroid gland is ligated and  删除换行 divided, the middle thyroid veins are ligated and divided and  删除换行 even the inferior thyroid artery may have to be ligated and  删除换行 divided. Once the lateral lobe is mobilised and retracted  删除换行 forward the pharyngeal pouch will be visible near the beginning  删除换行 of the oesophagus. With great care the whole pouch is gradually  删除换行 freed from the surrounding structures. Once the neck of the  删除换行 pouch is well defined by the position of the nasogastric tube  删除换行 and the ribbon gauze pack an incision is made on the neck of  删除换行 the pouch to incise only the outer layer of the pouch keeping  删除换行 intact the mucous membrane. Then the mucous membrane  删除换行 is also divided at the neck. This dissection is important to  删除换行 permit closure of the neck of the pouch in two layers — outer  删除换行 fibrous layer and inner mucous membrane layer. During  删除换行 suturing of the layers the mucous membrane is first sutured  删除换行 with atraumatic 2/0 catgut and the fibrous layer is closed  删除换行 over mucous membrane with interrupted sutures of fine silk. \n\n【51】During closure of the neck of the pouch care must be taken  删除换行 not to narrow the beginning of the oesophagus.\n\n【52】Cricopharyngeal myotomy is now performed in all cases  删除换行 like Heller's operation. The hypertrophied circular muscle  删除换行 is divided vertically till the submucosa is reached.删除27：<u>SWELLINGS IN THE NECK 119</u>\n\n【53】The incisional wound is closed with drainage. \n\n【54】POST-OPERATIVE CARE.— The patient is fed  删除换行 through nasogastric tube for 3 days, after which the tube is  删除换行 removed. Only liquids are given for the next 3 days by mouth. \n\n【55】Later on semisolid diet is started gradually.\n\n【56】OPERATIVE COMPLICATIONS.— (i) Infection.— If  删除换行 the pouch is perforated during freeing of the pouch, there is  删除换行 a chance of infection of the wound and even mediastinitis.\n\n【57】(ii) Fistula.— This only occurs if the the two layers are  删除换行 not meticulously sutured during closure of the neck of the  删除换行 pouch. So this step of operation is extremely important. In  删除换行 case a fistula occurs it usually closes by itself if the beginning  删除换行 of the oesophagus is not narrowed.\n\n【58】LOCAL TREATMENT.—\nThis is a narrow-necked air-containing diverticulum  删除换行 resulting from herniation of the laryngeal mucosa. It may  删除换行 be located internal or external to the laryngeal skeleton.\n\n【59】An internal laryngocele may displace and enlarge the false  删除换行 vocal cord and may result in hoarseness or airway obstruction.\n\n【60】External laryngocele passes through the thyrohyoid  删除换行 membrane and presents as a swelling in the neck over the  删除换行 thyrohyoid membrane.\n\n【61】Laryngoceles are more common in glassblowers, wind  删除换行 instruments musicians and others who develop high  删除换行 intraluminal pressures.\n\n【62】Clinical features.— 1. As mentioned earlier it is more  删除换行 common among trumpet players and persons with chronic  删除换行 cough.\n\n【63】2. This is a smooth ovoid swelling which is tympanic.\n\n【64】3- The swelling becomes prominent when the patient is  删除换行 asked to blow or perform Valsalva manoeuvre.\n\n【65】4. The swelling is boggy in feel and may be resonant on  删除换行 percussion.\n\n【66】5. Sometimes laryngocele may fill with mucoid fluid and  删除换行 may become infected, in which case the term laryngopyocele 删除换行 is more appropriate.\n\n【67】6. There may be hoarseness of voice.\n\n【68】7. The swelling moves up with the larynx on swallowing.\n\n【69】This is quite diagnostic.\n\n【70】Treatment.— Laryngoceles are excised through transverse 删除换行 cervical incision. The sac is dissected from the surrounding  删除换行 tissue upto the point where it comes out through the  删除换行 thyrohyoid membrane. The neck is ligated and divided and  删除换行 the whole sac is excised. The membrane is repaired by  删除换行 invaginating the stump of the neck almost like the stump of  删除换行 the vermiform appendix.\n\n【71】AETIOLOGY.—\nA rib arising from the 7th cervical vertebra is called a  删除换行 cervical rib. Cervical rib rarely causes a visible swelling and 删除换行 if there is a swelling in the subclavian triangle at the position  删除换行 of the cervical rib, one should rather think in the line of  删除换行 subclavian artery aneurysm rather than a cervical rib.\n\n【72】The patients with cervical rib usually present with  删除换行 neurological and vascular symptoms in the arm. It must be  删除换行 remembered that presence of cervical rib does not always cause 删除换行 symptoms and many such cervical ribs have been passed  删除换行 unnoticed or detected in the course of routine X-ray  删除换行 examination.\n\n【73】There are mainly four varieties of cervical ribs seen in  删除换行 clinical practice :—\n\n【74】(a) A complete rib which articulates anteriorly with the  删除换行 manubrium sterni or the first rib.\n\n【75】(b) An almost complete rib with the free end of the rib  删除换行 expands into a bony mass. This variety may give rise to a  删除换行 visible swelling in the subclavian triangle in the neck.\n\n【76】(c) A true incomplete rib ends into a fibrous band which  删除换行 is connected to the scalene tubercle of the first rib.\n\n【77】(d) An only fibrous band all along which is closely applied  删除换行 or incorporated in the scalenus medius muscle. This can  删除换行 give rise to symptoms, but is not revealed by X-ray.\n\n【78】The brachial plexus and the subclavian artery emerge  删除换行 between the scalenus anticus and scalenus medius ensheathed  删除换行 by axillary sheath, a prolongation of the prevertebral fascia  删除换行 which covers these muscles. So brachial plexus and subclavian  删除换行 artery come out through a triangle formed anteriorly by the  删除换行 scalenus anticus, posteriorly by the scalenus medius and  删除换行 below or the base by the first rib. When there is cervical rib  删除换行 the subclavian artery and the first thoracic nerve are lifted  删除换行 up and this is the main pathology which gives rise to both  删除换行 vascular and neurological symptoms.\n\n【79】Vascular symptoms are caused by constriction of the lumen  删除换行 of the subclavian artery as the artery is lifted up by the cervical  删除换行 rib. Such constriction is followed by post-stenotic dilatation  删除换行 where clotting occurs in the intima of the artery. Mural  删除换行 thrombus may become detached and give rise to emboli. \n\n【80】Rarely proximal extension of the thrombus may affect the  删除换行 vertebral artery and cause cerebrovascular embolic episodes.\n\n【81】Neurological symptoms are mainly caused by pressure on  删除换行 the first thoracic nerve from below by the cervical rib.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【0】SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS.—\n\n【1】Such diverticulum arises as a protrusion or herniation of  删除换行 the mucosa of the pharynx through a weak spot in the  删除换行 posterior pharyngeal wall, known as Killian’s dehiscence.

This  删除换行 weak area lies between the upper oblique fibres (known as \n\n【2】Thyropharyngeus) and the sphincter-like transverse fibres \n\n【3】(known as Cricopharyngeus) of the inferior constrictor muscle  删除换行 of the pharynx. Both these parts of the inferior constrictor  删除换行 muscle of the pharynx have different nerve supplies and  删除换行 functions.\n\n【4】THYROPHARYNGEUS PART.— The fibres of this part  删除换行 of inferior constrictor of pharynx are oblique in direction as  删除换行 the fibres take origin (mainly) from the oblique line of the  删除换行 lamina of the thyroid cartilage and spread backwards and  删除换行 medially and are inserted with the muscle of the opposite  删除换行 side into a fibrous raphe in the posterior midline of the  删除换行 pharynx. Its main nerve supply comes from the pharyngeal  删除换行 branch of the vagus nerve which arises from the upper part  删除换行 of the inferior ganglion of the vagus nerve and consists  删除换行 principally of the fibres from the cranial root of the accessory  删除换行 nerve. The main function of this part of the inferior  删除换行 constrictor muscle is to propel the food following deglutition.\n\n【5】CRICOPHARYNGEUS PART.— The fibres of this part  删除换行 of the inferior constrictor arise from the side of the cricoid  删除换行 cartilage and pass backwards horizontally to be continuous  删除换行 with the fibres of the opposite side and are continuous below  删除换行 with the circular fibres of the oesophagus. This muscle  删除换行 surrounds the narrowest part of the pharynx and acts as the  删除换行 sphincteric part of the muscle. During swallowing the \n\n【6】Cricopharyngeus relaxes so that the bolus of food passes  删除换行 unhindered. Failure of such relaxation will result in an  删除换行 increased pressure within the lower part of the pharynx and  删除换行 will cause herniation of the pharyngeal mucous membrane  删除换行 posteriorly through the weak spot — known as Killian's 删除换行 dehiscence. Such herniation is known as pharyngeal pouch  删除换行 or diverticulum of the pharynx. So it is a pressure diverticulum 删除换行 or pulsion diverticulum of the pharynx which is often miscalled  删除换行 as diverticulum of the oesophagus. The nerve supply of this  删除换行 part of inferior constrictor mainly derives from the recurrent  删除换行 laryngeal nerve and external laryngeal nerve.\n\n【7】The course of the diverticulum.— To start with it is a midline  删除换行 swelling of the posterior aspect of the pharynx. As the  删除换行 diverticulum enlarges in size the resistance of the vertebral  删除换行 column pushes it to the one side or the other, usually to the  删除换行 left side.\n\n【8】GENERAL TREATMENT —\n\n【9】(i) Age.— The sufferers are usually old people.\n\n【10】(ii) Sex.— It is commoner in men at the ratio of 2:1.\n\n【11】The course of the diverticulum can be divided into 3 删除换行 stages for facility of description of clinical features.\n\n【12】STAGE I.— This is the stage of initial bulging and it is  删除换行 symptomless. The pathology can only be detected as an accident  删除换行 during the course of a barium swallow examination for some  删除换行 other purpose. At this stage there is only a small diverticulum  删除换行 in the posterior aspect of the pharynx which has not touched  删除换行 the vertebral column. In only extremely rare cases the patient  删除换行 may complain of a sensation of foreign body in the throat.\n\n【13】STAGE II.— In this stage the diverticulum is larger and  删除换行 more globular but it still lies in the posterior midline, but  删除换行 touches the vertebral column. The main symptoms at this  删除换行 stage are :\n\n【14】(a) Regurgitation of undigested food material at a different  删除换行 time e.g. at the time of turning to one side or the other at  删除换行 night or even during swallowing at the next time of eating.\n\n【15】(b) Such regurgitation may awaken the patient from sleep  删除换行 with a sense of suffocation and violent coughing.\n\n【16】(c) Occasionally abscess of lung may result from  删除换行 regurgitation of food into the air passage.\n\n【17】At this stage operation and excision of the pouch is  删除换行 indicated.\n\n【18】Thyropharyngeus\n\n【19】Pharyngeal\n\n【20】Pouch\n\n【21】Cricopharyngeus\n删除3：<u>Fig.8.16.— Shows how a pharyngeal pouch is formed through the</u>\n\n【22】Killian's dehiscence between the Thyropharyngeus above and Fig.8.17.— Demonstrates the usual position of a swelling caused \n\n【23】Cricopharyngeus below. by the 3rd stage of the pharyngeal pouch.删除27：<u>118 A TEXTBOOK ON SURGICAL SHORT CASES</u>\n\n【24】STAGE III.— In this stage the diverticulum becomes  删除换行 even bigger in size and is pushed to the left side by the  删除换行 vertebral column. The fundus of the pouch becomes  删除换行 dependent and lies in the posterior triangle of the neck. The  删除换行 mouth of the pouch looks horizontally upwards. The main  删除换行 symptoms are :\n\n【25】(a) Symptoms of the second stage persist.\n\n【26】(b) In about l/3rd of cases a swelling is visible in the  删除换行 posterior triangle of the neck and the swelling becomes larger  删除换行 as the patient drinks.\n\n【27】(c) Dysphagia is a main symptom of this stage and in  删除换行 fact many patients come to the clinician only with this  删除换行 symptom. This is due to the fact that the pouch compresses  删除换行 the oesophagus and the dysphagia results.\n\n【28】(d) A gurgling noise may be heard in the neck as the  删除换行 patient swallows.\n\n【29】(e) Due to semi-starvation there is progressive loss of  删除换行 weight and gradually the patient may become cachectic in  删除换行 the long run.\n\n【30】(f) Aspiration of the contents of the pouch may lead to  删除换行 lung abscess, aspiration pneumonia etc.\n\n【31】So in this stage the main complaints are regurgitation,  删除换行 increasing dysphagia and visible swelling in the neck.\n\n【32】The features of the swelling in the neck caused by the  删除换行 3rd stage of pharyngeal pouch are :\n\n【33】(i) Site.— The swelling usually lies in the posterior  删除换行 triangle of the left side. That means such swelling is always  删除换行 posterior to the sternomastoid muscle and in front of the  删除换行 trapezius muscle. This swelling lies usually inferior to the  删除换行 level of the thyroid cartilage as the position of the Killian's  删除换行 dehiscence is below the Thyropharyngeus muscle which  删除换行 corresponds to the level of the thyroid cartilage. This swelling  删除换行 lies deep to the deep cervical fascia, so when the sternomastoid  删除换行 muscle is made taut there is slight decrease in the prominence  删除换行 of the swelling as the deep cervical fascia also becomes taut  删除换行 by that manoeuvre.\n\n【34】(ii) Size and shape.— It is usually globular in shape,  删除换行 but the size varies according to the duration of the swelling.\n\n【35】(iii) Surface is usually smooth and the edge is indistinct.\n\n【36】(iv) Consistency.— It is soft and cystic. It can be reduced. \n\n【37】Fluctuation test is positive, but transillumination test is  删除换行 negative.\n\n【38】(v) Fixity.— This swelling is not mobile and is fixed to  删除换行 the surrounding structures.\n\n【39】SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS.— Two investigations are  删除换行 important in this regard —\n\n【40】1. RADIOGRAPHY.— With a very thin emulsion of  删除换行 barium, barium swallow examination should be performed. \n\n【41】Anteroposterior view may not be very helpful as the barium  删除换行 filled pharyngeal pouch will superimpose on the beginning  删除换行 of the oesophagus and may look like a septum obstructing 删除换行 the commencement of the oesophagus. The best view to  删除换行 diagnose pharyngeal pouch is the semi-lateral view. If the  删除换行 pouch is compressed one will see in the screen the barium  删除换行 to be spilled into the oesophagus. Moreover one can see the  删除换行 overflow of barium emulsion into the oesophagus from the  删除换行 top of the pouch. One may find the fundus of the pouch  删除换行 invading the superior mediastinum.\n\n【42】Chest X-ray is essential to exclude associated lung abscess  删除换行 or aspiration pneumonitis.\n\n【43】2. OESOPHAGOSCOPY.— This investigation is not as  删除换行 necessary as the previous one. It is also dangerous. The  删除换行 instrument may perforate the fundus of the pouch, which is  删除换行 quite thin and fragile.\n\n【44】DRUG DOSAGE CHART FOR ADULTS\n\n【45】In Stage I— operation is not indicated and the  删除换行 diverticulum is almost ignored until and unless the patient  删除换行 comes with more symptoms of stage II.\n\n【46】In Stage II and Stage III — operation is strongly advised  删除换行 and the pharyngeal pouch is excised with cricopharyngeal  删除换行 myotomy (almost similar to Heller's operation).\n\n【47】OPERATION.— Endoscopy is first performed with two  删除换行 ideas —\n\n【48】(i) To pack the pouch with ribbon gauze and (ii) to pass  删除换行 a nasogastric tube into the oesophagus to determine the  删除换行 position of the sac.\n\n【49】Either a transverse incision at the level of the cricoid  删除换行 cartilage is made or an oblique incision along the anterior  删除换行 border of the left sternomastoid muscle is made.\n\n【50】The lateral lobe of the thyroid gland is first mobilised. To  删除换行 do this the superior pole of the thyroid gland is ligated and  删除换行 divided, the middle thyroid veins are ligated and divided and  删除换行 even the inferior thyroid artery may have to be ligated and  删除换行 divided. Once the lateral lobe is mobilised and retracted  删除换行 forward the pharyngeal pouch will be visible near the beginning  删除换行 of the oesophagus. With great care the whole pouch is gradually  删除换行 freed from the surrounding structures. Once the neck of the  删除换行 pouch is well defined by the position of the nasogastric tube  删除换行 and the ribbon gauze pack an incision is made on the neck of  删除换行 the pouch to incise only the outer layer of the pouch keeping  删除换行 intact the mucous membrane. Then the mucous membrane  删除换行 is also divided at the neck. This dissection is important to  删除换行 permit closure of the neck of the pouch in two layers — outer  删除换行 fibrous layer and inner mucous membrane layer. During  删除换行 suturing of the layers the mucous membrane is first sutured  删除换行 with atraumatic 2/0 catgut and the fibrous layer is closed  删除换行 over mucous membrane with interrupted sutures of fine silk. \n\n【51】During closure of the neck of the pouch care must be taken  删除换行 not to narrow the beginning of the oesophagus.\n\n【52】Cricopharyngeal myotomy is now performed in all cases  删除换行 like Heller's operation. The hypertrophied circular muscle  删除换行 is divided vertically till the submucosa is reached.删除27：<u>SWELLINGS IN THE NECK 119</u>\n\n【53】The incisional wound is closed with drainage. \n\n【54】POST-OPERATIVE CARE.— The patient is fed  删除换行 through nasogastric tube for 3 days, after which the tube is  删除换行 removed. Only liquids are given for the next 3 days by mouth. \n\n【55】Later on semisolid diet is started gradually.\n\n【56】OPERATIVE COMPLICATIONS.— (i) Infection.— If  删除换行 the pouch is perforated during freeing of the pouch, there is  删除换行 a chance of infection of the wound and even mediastinitis.\n\n【57】(ii) Fistula.— This only occurs if the the two layers are  删除换行 not meticulously sutured during closure of the neck of the  删除换行 pouch. So this step of operation is extremely important. In  删除换行 case a fistula occurs it usually closes by itself if the beginning  删除换行 of the oesophagus is not narrowed.\n\n【58】LOCAL TREATMENT.—\nThis is a narrow-necked air-containing diverticulum  删除换行 resulting from herniation of the laryngeal mucosa. It may  删除换行 be located internal or external to the laryngeal skeleton.\n\n【59】An internal laryngocele may displace and enlarge the false  删除换行 vocal cord and may result in hoarseness or airway obstruction.\n\n【60】External laryngocele passes through the thyrohyoid  删除换行 membrane and presents as a swelling in the neck over the  删除换行 thyrohyoid membrane.\n\n【61】Laryngoceles are more common in glassblowers, wind  删除换行 instruments musicians and others who develop high  删除换行 intraluminal pressures.\n\n【62】Clinical features.— 1. As mentioned earlier it is more  删除换行 common among trumpet players and persons with chronic  删除换行 cough.\n\n【63】2. This is a smooth ovoid swelling which is tympanic.\n\n【64】3- The swelling becomes prominent when the patient is  删除换行 asked to blow or perform Valsalva manoeuvre.\n\n【65】4.

Sometimes laryngocele may fill with mucoid fluid and  删除换行 may become infected, in which case the term laryngopyocele 删除换行 is more appropriate.\n\n【67】6. There may be hoarseness of voice.\n\n【68】7. The swelling moves up with the larynx on swallowing.\n\n【69】This is quite diagnostic.\n\n【70】Treatment.— Laryngoceles are excised through transverse 删除换行 cervical incision. The sac is dissected from the surrounding  删除换行 tissue upto the point where it comes out through the  删除换行 thyrohyoid membrane. The neck is ligated and divided and  删除换行 the whole sac is excised.

Other differential diagnoses include pregnancy-specific dermatoses,  删除换行 primarily pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy (a non-bullous eruption),  删除换行 and non-pregnancy associated eruptions (e.g. erythema multiforme, acute urticaria, sca删除8：<u>￾</u>bies, allergic contact dermatitis, bullous pemphigoid, or other immunobullous diseases). \n\n【25】Cholestasis of pregnancy is important to consider when faced with a pruritic patient in  删除换行 her mid-trimester without an eruption. It is associated with elevated serum bilirubin and  删除换行 a significant risk of fetal prematurity.\n\n【26】PG is a pregnancy-associated subepidermal immunobullous disease, analogous to bul删除8：<u>￾</u>lous pemphigoid. The diagnosis can be confirmed by the demonstration of tissue-bound  删除换行 and circulating immunoglobulin G antibodies and complement, targeting the cutaneous  删除换行 basement membrane zone by direct and indirect immunofluorescence studies, and also  删除换行 by subepidermal blisters on histology.\n\n【27】There are several considerations when forming a management plan. First, the fetal out删除8：<u>￾</u>come in PG is generally good; second, it is a self-limiting condition that is expected to  删除换行 remit following delivery (although it may occur earlier and in a more severe form during  删除换行 subsequent pregnancies).

Mother observed the lesion 3 years back and gave the history of treatment for vitiligo for three months from a general practitioner with no relief. Mother gave the history of slight increase in size of lesion with age. There was no history of any skin disease or any injury prior to development of lesion. Rest of the history was non-contributory.

It can affect any race or gender. Exact cause of nevus depigmentosus is still not clearly understood. It is believed to be a cutaneous pigmentary mosaic disorder wherein functional defect of melanocytes with morphological abnormalities of melanosomes are major factors resulting in ND. Melanocytes have reduced ability to produce melanin and to transfer melanosomes to keratinocytes. Melanosomes can be diminished in number, heteromorphic, aggregated in melanocytes, or located in membrane bound aggregates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. It presents with solitary well circumscribed hypo- to depigmented patch, with an irregular serrated but well defined border, which do not cross midline. Many times smaller lesions may appear distributed over edge giving it a splashed paint appearance. It is commonly visible at birth and may appear later in adulthood. Commonly affected sites are trunk, neck, face and proximal part of extremities but it may occur at anywhere on the body. It may increases in size with the growth of the body and after reaching its maximum dimensions it usually remains unchanged throughout life. In contrast to what its name suggests, the nevus depigmentosus presents itself as a hypopigmentation rather than a depigmentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Three clinical subtypes have been described:\n\n【22】1.  1.\n\n【23】    Isolated or localised form (solitary and well defined lesion)—It is most common pattern.\n\n【24】2.  2.\n\n【25】    Segmental form (unilateral, band shaped sometimes Blaschkoid distribution)\n\n【26】3.  3.\n\n【27】    Systematized form (extensive whorls or linear streaks of hypopigmentation, following lines of Blaschko): This subtype is very rare and may have extra cutaneous manifestations such as seizures, mental retardation, hemi hypertrophy, and yellow hair and may have been categorised as hypomelanosis of Ito 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】The diagnosis is usually made clinically. Coupe et al. in 1976, have proposed a diagnostic criteria and diagnosis of ND is made when 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>\n\n【29】   Leukoderma is present at birth or of early onset\n\n【30】   No alteration in the distribution of leukoderma throughout life\n\n【31】   No alteration in texture or change in sensation in the affected area\n\n【32】   Absence of hyperpigmented border\n\n【33】Histological studies on lesional skin compared with perilesional normal skin shows a marked reduction in melanin, with normal to reduced number of melanocytes with S-100 stain and less reactivity with 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine reaction. There is no pigment incontinence. On electron microscopy melanocytes show stubby dendrites and autophagosomes with aggregates of melanosomes. Diascopy test is negative in ND and positive in its close differential nevus anemicus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Dermoscopy shows off-white color in ND which helps it in differentiating from vitiligo (chalky white color). Other findings include faint pigment network over the lesion, and serrated borders extending onto the normal skin as “ pseudopods ”  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n删除3：<u>Figure 15.3\n\n【34】Dermoscopy of the lesion shows faint, but normal reticular pattern of pigment within the depigmented area (black circles), and pseudopods (red circle) (Courtesy: Dr. Shekhar Neema)\n</u>\nThe common clinical differential diagnoses include nevus anemicus, piebaldism and hypomelanosis of Ito. Nevus anemicus is an uncommon hypopigmented disorder which results from vasoconstriction of small vessels due to increased sensitivity of adrenergic receptor of the endothelial cells of the affected area. It is usually present at birth as hypopigmented macule of variable size. Borders merge with surrounding skin on applying pressure. It can be illustrated by putting glass slide with pressure known as diascopy test . It becomes more visible on emotional stress. Rarely, it may be associated with port-wine stain and neurofibromatosis type 1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Piebaldism is a rare autosomal dominant condition with mutation in the c-kit proto-oncogene, mapped to the proximal long arm of chromosome 4 or deletions in the SLUG gene, which is zinc-finger neural crest transcription factor. It is present at birth with extensive, symmetrically distributed depigmented macules mainly on forehead (often triangular in shape), front of thorax and extremities. The depigmented patch is often associated with hyperpigmented macules within areas of depigmentation. The white forelock is present in 80–90% of affected individuals. Eyebrow and eyelash hair may also be affected. It is may be associated with Waardenburg’s syndrome —a syndrome of White forelock, Heterochromia iridis, and Deafmutism among other features 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Hypomelanosis of Ito (HOI) is rare genetic sporadic disease with autosomal dominant, recessive and X linked inheritance. HOI and ND can be considered phenotypic expression of mosaicism in pigment gene. Clinically it present similar to systematized pattern of ND in which hypopigmented areas consisting of bilateral or unilateral whorls and streaks corresponding to the lines of Blaschko. Other types of pigmentary pattern are possible checkerboard pattern, phylloid pattern, and patchy pattern without midline separation. It is likely that mutations in pigmentary gene occur much earlier in HOI and thus more body structures are involved (62–94% chance of systemic involvement). The heterogeneity of genetic anomalies may be due to the presence of multiple loci coding for pigment related proteins. Common systemic involvement is neurological (epilepsy, developmental delay, microcephaly, hypotonia, hyperkinesias, deafness), skeletal (scoliosis, hypertelorism, coarse facies, nose and ear abnormalities, syndactyly, polydactyly) and ocular (ptosis, microphthalmia, nystagmus, strabismus). The distinction between whorled ND and HOI is unclear at times. Cases of HOI without extra cutaneous anomalies have often been categorized as ND, whereas cases of ND associated with extra cutaneous anomalies may have been categorized as HOI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Other clinical differentials include ash leaf macule, Hansen’s disease and pityriasis alba 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【35】Usually ND doesn’t require any active treatment. While thorough and gentle counselling is often sufficient, various treatment modalities include Camouflage, surgical grafting and excimer laser may be tried for cosmetic reasons 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【36】### Key Points\n\n【37】   Nevus depigmentosus is uncommon congenital pigmentary disorder which may cause significant psychological morbidity in patients with skin of color.\n\n【38】   Clinically, nevus depigmentosus is characterized by a hypopigmented patch with serrated border. The lesion grows in size in proportion to the growth of the body and eventually becomes stable.\n\n【39】   Detailed clinical examination and investigations may be required to rule out systemic involvement in patients with extensive lesions.\n\n【40】   Usually counselling about the nature of disease is required. Some patients may seek treatment for aesthetic reasons.\n\n【41】###", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 11:56:27", "endTime": "2024/09/12 11:56:54", "cost": 26.954}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:32", "update_time": "2024-09-11 19:56:54", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 19:56:27"}

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that is most commonly associated with nosocomial pneumonia. Pulmonary infections primarily occur in patients with underlying disease such as cystic fibrosis or chronic lung or heart disease, who have immune suppression, or who are on ventilators. Skin infections occur in patients whose skin has been disrupted either by burn or trauma. Skin lesions can also be a secondary effect of disseminated disease and are known as ecthyma gangrenosum. Other common infections include urinary tract infection in catheterized patients and chronic otitis. Malignant otitis externa, a severe external ear infection, which can potentially invade through the cranial bones and nerves, is seen primarily in the elderly and in diabetics. Pseudomonas also needs to be considered in cases of otitis externa, in which the tympanic membrane is ruptured. Other complications are uncommonly a result of Pseudomonas bacteremia, such as endocarditis, meningitis, and bone and joint infections.\n\n【12】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【13】#### Patient With Suspected Pseudomonas Infection\n\n【14】### OBJECTIVES\n\n【15】1\\. Know the structural and physiologic characteristics of P. aeruginosa .\n\n【16】2\\. Know the virulence factors associated with P. aeruginosa .\n\n【17】### DEFINITIONS\n\n【18】PERIAURICULAR: Around the external ear\n\n【19】ESR: A measure of the time it takes for red blood cells to settle, which is a nonspecific measure of inflammation\n\n【20】ECTHYMA GANGRENOSUM: Pustular skin lesions that later become necrotic ulcers and can lead to gangrene\n\n【21】### DISCUSSION\n\n【22】Characteristics of Pseudomonas Species\n\n【23】Pseudomonas species is a ubiquitous, aerobic gram-negative bacillus. At least 10 species are included in the genus that can cause disease in humans. Some of the closely related organisms have been transferred to their own genus, such as Burkholderia cepacia , formerly P. cepacia. P. aeruginosa is the most common cause of human infections. It is motile as a result of the presence of polar flagellae. It is found commonly in the environment and has a predilection for moist areas. Reservoirs in nature include soil, vegetation, and water. Reservoirs in a hospital include sinks, toilets, mops, respiratory therapy, and dialysis equipment. It exhibits intrinsic resistance to many antibiotics and disinfectants. It has minimal growth requirements and can be easily cultured on many media in a wide range of temperatures. It has multiple virulence factors. Pseudomonas adheres to host cells by pili and nonpili adhesins. It produces a polysaccharide capsule that allows the organism to adhere to epithelial cells, inhibits phagocytosis, and confers protection against antibiotic activity. Patients with cystic fibrosis are more likely to be infected with a strain whose colony appears mucoid because of the presence of the capsule.\n\n【24】Pseudomonas produces multiple toxins and enzymes, which contribute to its virulence.\n\n【25】Its lipopolysaccharide endotoxin and exotoxin A appear to cause most of the systemic manifestations of Pseudomonas infection. Exotoxin A blocks protein synthesis in host cells, causing direct cytotoxicity. It mediates systemic toxic effects as well. It is similar in function to diphtheria toxin but is structurally and immunologically distinct. Endotoxin contributes to the development of many of the symptoms and signs of sepsis, including fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension.\n\n【26】Antibiotic resistance is another important aspect of its virulence. It is intrinsically resistant to numerous antibiotics and has acquired resistance to others through various means. The polysaccharide capsule prevents the penetration of many antibiotics into Pseudomonas . Penetration of antibiotic into the Pseudomonas cell is usually through pores in the outer membrane. Mutation of these porin proteins appears to be a primary mechanism of its antibiotic resistance. Multidrug efflux pumps and β-lactamase production also contribute to the antibiotic resistance that so frequently complicates the treatment of Pseudomonas infections.\n\n【27】Some P. aeruginosa strains produce a diffusable pigment: pyocyanin, which gives the colonies a blue color; fluorescein, which gives them a yellow color; or pyorubin, which gives them a red-brown color. Pyocyanin also seems to aid in the virulence of the organism by stimulating an inflammatory response and by producing toxic oxygen radicals.\n\n【28】### DIAGNOSIS\n\n【29】Diagnosis of malignant otitis externa is by the common clinical features of otorrhea, painful edematous ear canal with a purulent discharge. Culture of the discharge from the internal ear grows P. aeruginosa in most cases. P. aeruginosa grows readily on routine laboratory media. Preliminary identification can be made by colony morphology, particularly if typical green pigment is produced. P. aeruginosa appears as a clear to dark colony on MacConkey agar, indicating that it does not ferment lactose. Colonies of P. aeruginosa are β-hemolytic and dark colored, as a result of pigment production and blood agar media. The organisms are motile, and therefore colonies appear spread. It does not ferment glucose, is oxidase positive and is therefore not a part of the Enterobacteriaceae family, but it is considered a nonfermenter. P. aeruginosa can be distinguished from some of the other closely related species by its ability to grow at a wide range of temperatures, up to as high as 107.6°F (42°C). The colonies also have a distinct odor, sometimes considered a grape-like odor. Confirmatory identification can be made by numerous commercially available identification systems.\n\n【30】### TREATMENT AND PREVENTION\n\n【31】Treatment of malignant otitis externa includes surgery to remove necrotic tissue and pus and appropriate antibiotics. Treatment with two antibiotics to which the organism is susceptible is optimal. P. aeruginosa is usually inherently resistant to multiple antibiotics. Most are susceptible to the antipseudomonal penicillins, such as piperacillin and ticarcillin and to the newer fluoroquinolones as well as the aminoglycosides. Imipenem is often reserved for treatment of infections caused by drug-resistant strains.\n\n【32】###", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 11:40:02", "endTime": "2024/09/12 11:40:22", "cost": 20.505}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:32", "update_time": "2024-09-11 19:40:22", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 19:40:01"}

This is a classic description of a patient with Bartter syndrome, a defect in the ion channels of the thick ascending loop of Henle. Clinically, patients have low-to-normal blood pressure, with short stature and failure to thrive, and various lab abnormalities, including hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and hyperaldosteronism. Depending on the extent of the metabolic derangements, patients may also have nonspecific symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and muscle cramps. If the electrolyte abnormalities become severe, patients are at risk for seizures. Bartter syndrome has three variants, each affecting the sodium-potassium-chloride pump and each resulting in a different defective channel in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, the site at which furosemide, a loop diuretic, acts.  \n\n【7】Answer A is incorrect . Acetazolamide acts at the proximal convoluted tubule, inhibiting carbonic anhydrase. It causes a reduction in total-body bicarbonate. Acetazolamide can result in type 2 renal tubular acidosis, but not Bartter syndrome.  \n\n【8】Answer C is incorrect . Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic that acts early in the distal tubule. Metabolic derangements seen with this drug include hypokalemic metabolic acidosis, hyponatremia, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hyperuricemia, and hypercalcemia.  \n\n【9】Answer D is incorrect . Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that acts as a competitive aldosterone receptor antagonist in the cortical collecting tubule.

Recheck serum electrolytes every 2 to 4 hours， and carefully monitor mental status and neuro-ogical examination.1\\. To learn to identify the patients “at-risk”for the development of fluid/electro lyte abnormalities.\n\n【6】2\\. To learn the detrimental effects of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities and replacement strategies.This patient was admitted to the ICU for management of hemorrhagic stroke and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Acute changes in mental status necessitate immediate repeat CT of the brain to rule out cerebral vasospasm as the etiology. In this case， the repeat head CT returned with no interval changes. However， laboratory test-ing reveals an electrolyte abnormality， namely hyponatremia， which may explain the newly altered mental status. Hyponatremia is a common problem in patients with CNS disease because the brain’s ability to regulate sodium and water homeo-stasis is often altered. It is the most common electrolyte abnormality after an aneu-rysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)， occurring in 34% of patients after SAH. It usually occurs between the 2nd and 10th post-bleed day， closely paralleling the period of cerebral vasospasm. It is likely due to cerebral salt wasting， but the trigger is unknown. Natriuresis and volume depletion from cerebral salt wasting may con-tribute to severe vasospasm in SAH. The diagnosis and management of other fluid and electrolyte abnormalities is paramount.HYPONATREMIA： Serum sodium concentration <135 mmol/L. Hyponatremia is usually asymptomatic unless the absolute level is <120 mmol/L or the change in sodium concentration is very rapid (within hours).\n\n【7】TOTAL BODY WATER (TBW)： The amount of water in the body， estimated as60% of a person's weight for men， or 50% of a person's weight for women. One-third of the total body water is located in the extracellular fluid (ECF) compartment， whereas two-thirds of the total body water is located in the intracellular fluid (ICF) compartment.TONICITY： A measure of the relative osmotic activity in 2 solutions separated by a membrane that is permeable to water but not solutes. Tonicity is also referred to as effective osmolality.Patients “at-risk” for the development fluid/electrolyte abnormalities include those with pulmonary or mediastinal disease and CNS diseases. Hyponatremia， which manifests as vague constitutional or mental status changes， can be found in up to 15% to 30% of hospitalized patients. Hyponatremia has the potential to cause substantial morbidity and mortality， and has been identified as an independent risk factor for mortality in hospitalized patients. Moreover， overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurological deficits and death.\n\n【8】Sodium homeostasis： Abnormalities of plasma sodium concentration usually reflect an abnormality in total body water rather than a problem with sodium bal-ance. Total body water and its composition are tightly regulated by both osmotic and nonosmotic processes. Under normal circumstances， plasma osmolality is the major determinant of water balance， where plasma osmolality is maintained at approxi mately 280 to 295 mOsm/kg by arginine vasopressin (AVP)， otherwise known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH). Changes in plasma osmolality are monitored by the host by changes in the size of specialized neurons in the hypothalamus， called osmo-receptors. These changes in tonicity are relayed to the magnocellular neurons in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus， which synthesize AVP\n\n【9】for subsequent storage and release. An increase in plasma osmolality triggers the release of AVP， which act on V2 receptors in the kidneys to increase water perme-ability in the distal tubule and collecting duct of the nephrons， resulting in water retention and a subsequent fall in the osmolality. At serum osmolarity levels >295mOsm/kg， a person's thirst mechanism is also stimulated， triggering an increase in free-water consumption if the person is able to drink. On the contrary， a decrease in plasma osmolality of just 1% to 2% with water intake suppresses AVP secretion and leads to urinary excretion of excess water， thus raising the plasma osmolality back toward normal.\n\n【10】Plasma AVP is also regulated by nonosmotic factors， such as blood pressure and circulating blood volume. Arterial stretch baroreceptors are located in the carotid sinus， aortic arch， cardiac atria， and pulmonary venous system. With an 8% to 10%decrease in arterial pressure， the baroreceptors signal the hypothalamus to release AVP into the plasma. The circulating AVP acts on V2 receptors in the kidney， increasing free-water reabsorption. In addition， AVP acts on V1 receptors on blood vessels， causing an increase in vascular resistance and in blood pressure. When hyponatremia is with associated hypovolemia， the nonosmotic stimulation of AVP can cause an increase in water retention and worsening of hyponatremia， despite the presence of hypo-osmolality. During periods of low blood volume or blood pressure， baroreceptors in the cardiac atria stimulate the adrenal release of aldosterone， which contributes to sodium and water reabsorption via the proximal renal tubule.Symptomatic hyponatremia usually occurs with absolute sodium levels <120 mmol/L. However， symptoms may also arise secondary to very rapid changes in the serum sodium concentration. Acute hyponatremia is classified as occurring within 48hours， whereas chronic hyponatremia takes >48 hours to develop. Initial symptoms associated with hyponatremia can be mild， including headache， nausea and vom-iting， muscle cramps， aches， or generalized restlessness. With increasing severity， patients may become apathetic， lethargic， or acutely confused. If left undiagnosed and untreated， hyponatremia can progress to seizures， apnea， coma， and death. These symptoms are the manifestations of cerebral edema progression.Management of hyponatremia begins with a precise， often multistep， diagnostic algorithm thathelps pinpoint the cause of hyponatremia to guide its treatment. This diagnostic process is multistep because hyponatremia can be categorized according to different etiologies that culminate in one similar clinical presentation. For exam-ple， unlike hypernatremia， which always is associated with hypertonicity， hypona-tremia can occur in the settings of hypotonicity， isotonicity， or hypertonicity. Thus， the first step in patient evaluation is to measure the serum osmolality. Hypertonic hyponatremia occurs when effective solutes other than sodium， such as glucose or mannitol， accumulate in the ECF compartment. These solutes draw water from within cells into the extracellular space， resulting in a hypertonic hyponatre-mia as the sodium concentration is diluted. A rise in the serum glucose of 100mg/dL will cause a fall of ~1.6 mmol/L in serum sodium concentration. Isotonic hyponatremia， also called pseudohyponatremia， is usually produced by lab arti-facts caused by severe hypertriglyceridemia， hypercholesterolemia， or parapro teinemia that causes measured serum sodium levels to be falsely low while serum osmolality remains normal. Isotonic hyponatremia should trigger a search for an underlying cause of increased serum lipids or paraproteins. Treatment for hypertonic and isotonic hyponatremia centers on treating the underlying cause.\n\n【11】Hypotonic hyponatremia can be dilutional or depletional. Dilutional hyponatremia occurs when extracellular sodium concentrations are low relative to increases in total body water， and this can take place under 2 different scenarios： 1) The absolute sodium level may stay the same， but the total body water increases；and 2) the absolute sodium level increases， but not as much as the total body water， leading to a relative dilu-tion of sodium concentration. Depletional hyponatremia develops when sodium loss outpaces water loss.\n\n【12】After establishing a patient’s low serum osmolality， the diagnosis of hypotonic hyponatremia requires further investigation. The next step in diagnosis is to assess the patient's volume status. This is done using a combination of clinical and labora-tory signs. Examination of the patient should include assessment of weight changes， orthostatic variations in vital signs， skin turgor (less useful in elderly patients)， jugular venous pressure， central venous pressure if central access is available， and an echocardiogram to assess cardiac filling and inferior vena cava engorgement or compressibility. Laboratory measures of fluid status include hemo-concentration or -dilution and the BUN/Cr ratio. Evaluating volume status allows for the placement of a patient's hypotonic hyponatremia into 3 categories： hypovolemia， euvolemia， and hypervolemia.\n\n【13】Hypovolemic hyponatremia is depletional， and can be caused by either renal or extrarenal loss of sodium. Causes of renal sodium loss include diuretic use， cerebral salt wasting syndrome， mineralocorticoid deficiency， and salt-wasting nephropa-thy. Causes of extrarenal loss of sodium include gastrointestinal losses via vomit-ing or diarrhea， third space losses from bowel obstruction， pancreatitis， or burns， or sweat losses from endurance exercises. Differentiating between renal and extrarenal sodium loss is done by measuring urine sodium excretion. If the kidney is the site of sodium loss， a spot urine sodium concentration will be >20 mmol/L. On the con-trary， a urine sodium concentration of <20 mmol/L points to an extrarenal etiology of sodium loss.\n\n【14】Euvolemic hyponatremia has many causes， the most common being SIADH. The diagnosis of SIADH remains a diagnosis of exclusion and requires a dem-onstration of 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> hyponatremia， 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> low serum osmolality， 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> inappropriately concentrated urine (U>100 mOsm/kg)， 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> persistent urinary sodium excretion(Una>20 mmol/L)，and 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> exclusion of hypothyroidism or hypoadrenalism. There must also be an absence of any stimuli that might explain an increased secretion of AVP， such as hypovolemia and hypotension. If a measure of the urine osmolality returns with appropriately dilute urine (Uom <100 mOsm/kg)， the cause of hypo-natremia can be explained by excessive water intake (primary polydipsia or beer potomania).The goals of treating hyponatremia are 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> to achieve euvolemia and 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> to correct low sodium levels to a safe， but not necessarily normal， range in a con trolled manner to avoid the potential of osmotic demyelination. In the case of hypovolemic hypotonic hyponatremia， including cerebral salt wasting seen in SAH， volume replacement with normal saline (0.9% NaCl in water) to euvolemia gener-ally is enough to correct the low sodium level. With volume expansion， the trigger for nonosmotic AVP release is taken away， and the kidneys will then excrete excess free water and correct the serum sodium concentration toward normal. For symp-tomatic hyponatremia in euvolemic or hypervolemic contexts， correction of sodium levels should take place with hypertonic saline (3% NaCl in water). Because of the risk of osmotic demyelination， this should happen in a controlled manner. Osmotic demyelination can be avoided by limiting correction of hyponatremia to ≤10 to12 mmol/L in 24 hours and to <18 mmol/L in 48 hours. Rate of correction should be even slower in patients with risk factors such as severe malnutrition， alcoholism， or advanced liver disease. Acute treatment should be stopped once the patient's symptoms resolve， a safe serum sodium level (>120 mmol/L) is achieved， or a total magnitude of correction of 18 mmol/L is achieved. During this acute treat-ment phase， serum sodium levels should be monitored at frequent intervals (every2-4 hours).\n\n【15】How does one estimate the amount of infusion of hypertonic saline needed to stay within the safe rates of correction? Adrogue and Madias in 2000 published a seminal article on hyponatremia that included a formula that can be used to calcu-late the effect of 1 L of infusate on the serum sodium.\n\n【16】Change in serum Nat= (Infusate Nat- serum Na\\)/(TBW+1)\n\n【17】Along with acute reversal of symptomatic hyponatremia， fluid restriction is war-ranted for euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia. All fluids， not only water， need to be restricted. Nonfood fluids should be limited to 500 mL/d below the aver-age daily urine volume. Several days of restriction are needed to make a significant change in the plasma osmolality. Alternative therapy in cases of SIADH includes demeclocycline， which induces a nephrogenic form of diabetes insipidus and excre-tion of excess free water.\n\n【18】Research is currently underway for new treatments for hyponatremia. The FDA has approved conivaptan， a nonselective vasopressin receptor antagonist， for 4-day IV use to treat euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia. However， the use of this medication in patients with advanced cirrhosis is cautioned， as it also antagonizes\n\n【19】V1 receptors in the splanchnic region， thus increasing splanchnic flow and further elevating portal pressures in patients with liver disease； this predisposes to esopha-geal bleeding. Because of these concerns， selective V2 receptor antagonists are cur-rently being tested in phase 3 clinical studies.\n\n【20】Beyond disturbances in body water and sodium homeostasis， other electrolyte abnormalities in critically ill patients are also common and associated with poor patient outcomes. The following is a discussion on 3 electrolytes that are com-monly measured daily in the intensive care unit： potassium， magnesium， and phos-phorus.

The macrophages destroy the antibody-coated red cells .\n\n【8】Answer 2\n\n【9】If the mother and father are ABO identical， the fetus has a high likelihood of also being ABO compatible with its mother. If fetal blood enters the maternal circula-tion， it is likely to last much longer if the mother has no ABO alloantibodies against the fetal cells. For example， if the fetal red blood cells were of type B， they would be quickly hemolyzed if the mother were of red blood cell type A； she would have anti-B alloantibodies. Rapid destruction of the fetal red blood cells by hemolysis would impede alloimmunization of the mother.\n\n【10】Answer 3\n\n【11】Rh-negative cells were used because they cannot be hemolyzed by the IgG Rh anti-bodies that have crossed the placenta.\n\n【12】Answer 4\n\n【13】You shouldn't， because the amount given (300 Hg of IgG) is insufficient to cause the fetus harm.

She was given oxygen， aspirin， and nitroglycerin by the emergency medical services (EMS) in route to the emergency department (ED) and received morphine on her arrival to the ED. The patient is accompanied by her roommate who mentioned that the patient came back from a concert about an hour ago and complained of feeling nauseated， anxious， and somewhat paranoid. The patient has no history of health problems and has not had similar episodes in the past. She is currently sexually active with one male partner and takes oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) for birth control. She reports drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes occasionally.

In 2012， drug overdose was the leading cause of injury death among people aged 25 to 64， causing more deaths than motor vehicle accidents. The drug overdose rate has more than doubled from1999 to 2013. In 2013， 81.1% of the nearly 44，000 drug overdose deaths in the United States were unintentional， 12.4% were linked to suicide， and 6.4% were ofundetermined intent. In 2011， drug abuse accounted for 2.5 million emergency 删除换行 department visits， with over 1.5 million of these cases attributable to prescrip-tion drugs. As of 2012， the percent of US persons of age 12 or older with illicit drug use in the past month (9.2%) or marijuana use in the past month (7.3%) was greater than previous years.Vulnerability and affinity to addiction differ from person to person and is consid-ered multifactorial in origin. Factors include gender， ethnicity， developmental stage， and socioeconomic environment. Genetic susceptibility accounts for between 40%and 60% of a persons vulnerability to addiction. Populations at increased risk of drug abuse include adolescents and persons with psychiatric disorders.According to the 2009 National Survey on Drug Use and Health， marijuana was the most commonly abused drug followed by psychotherapeutic medications. Marijuana is now legal in several states for medicinal or recreational purposes， which may increase the likelihood for abuse and dependence. Daily marijuana use has increased to 8.1 million Americans in 2013. The highest rate of use was among 删除换行 18- to 25-year olds and males were more likely than females to be users of several different drugs. The highest rates of use were seen among American Indians or Alaska Natives followed by African Americans， Caucasians， Hispanics， and Asians. The rate of drug use was lower for college graduates than for those who did not graduate from high school. However， adults who had graduated from college were more likely to have tried illicit drugs in their lifetime than adults who had not completed high school. The rate of illicit drug use was higher for unemployed per-sons compared to those who were employed. The rate of current illicit drug use was approximately nine times higher among youths who smoked cigarettes than who did not. Among youths who were heavy drinkers， 69.9% also were current illicit drug users.

A common cause of male infertility is Klinefelter syndrome. It occurs in one out of about every 900 men. A patient with this condition has an extra X chromosome, and either the patient’s mother or the father can contribute this extra chromosome, and the origin of the chromosome appears to make no difference. The patient’s karyotype is 47,XXY. In Klinefelter syndrome, the testicles are nonfunctional, and therefore testosterone levels are decreased, resulting in a secondary increase in gonadotropin levels (FSH and LH) due to the lack of negative feedback. Patients with Klinefelter syndrome tend also to have the following signs: They are tall, long-limbed, and have a distribution pattern of fat and hair more typical of women. They also tend to have gynecomastia, or enlargement of the breasts.  \n\n【7】Answer A is incorrect .

This occurs at unpredictable times， typically lasts for several minutes， and then goes away. The smell is typically something burning. You suspect that this woman is having simple par-tial seizures and order an EEG. An abnormal discharge in which brain region would confirm your findings?\n\n【13】A. Occipital lobe\n\n【14】B.Superior parietal lobe\n\n【15】C.Medial temporal lobe\n\n【16】D.Anterolateral frontal lobe\n\n【17】21.1 C. As the olfactory neurons pass through the tiny holes in the cribriform plate， they are susceptible to injury， as occurred in this case. Olfactory neurons are small， bipolar neurons that run a very short distance from the olfactory epithelium of the superior nasal cavity through the cribriform plate to the1olfactory bulb in the olfactory groove of the frontal lobe. Depending on the degree of damage to the olfactory epithelium and the cribriform plate， the neurons may be able to regenerate， resulting in a return of the sense of smell.\n\n【18】21.2B. Although there are thousands of odorant receptors expressed in humans， each olfactory neuron expresses only one odorant receptor. The neurons expressing the same receptor project through the cribriform plate and synapse with mitral cells in the olfactory bulb. Each mitral cell receives input from neurons expressing the same odorant. Mitral cells then project their axons down the olfactory tract directly to the olfactory cortex. The neurons in the olfactory epithelium have a lifespan of just a few months， after which time they die and are replaced by new olfactory neurons derived form the basal cell layer of the olfactory epithelium.\n\n【19】21.3 C. The olfactory cortex， made up of the piriform cortex and the periamygda-loid cortex， is located on the medial aspect of the temporal lobe. Abnormal EEG readings from this area during the experience of an abnormal smell would confirm that seizure discharge is responsible for this woman’s symptoms. The occipital lobe houses the primary visual cortex； discharge here would result in abnormal vision. The superior parietal lobe contains the primary sensory cortex， and a discharge here would result in abnormal sensation. The antero-lateral frontal lobe is not a sensory area， but is involved in executive function.\n\n【20】NEUROSCIENCE PEARLS\n\n【21】删除17：<u>卜</u>COlfactory receptor neurons detect odorants in the olfactory epithelium in the nose and transmit information through the cribriform plate to mitral cells in the olfactory bulbs.\n\n【22】The olfactory system is the only sensory system in which second-order urons (the mitral cells) project directly to the cerebral cortex.\n\n【23】删除17：<u>一</u>All sensory pathways except the olfactory pathway have a relay nuclei through the thalamus.\n\n【24】TThe projection of olfactory information to the limbic area explains why certain smells can be evocative of memory and emotion.\n\n【25】删除17：<u>卜</u>AAnosmia can result from traumatic， infectious， and neoplastic etiologies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 14:19:54", "endTime": "2024/09/12 14:20:14", "cost": 19.637}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:32", "update_time": "2024-09-11 22:20:14", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 22:19:54"}

Prenatal screening for neural tube defects has become a routine part of prenatal care. This testing looks for elevated levels of certain substances in maternal serum. These markers include a-fetoprotein， human chorionic gonadotropin， and estriol. The combination of these three substances forms the contents of the triple screen.\n\n【21】\\[50.31 A. Holoprosencephaly is an abnormality that results from failure of the brain to cleave into two hemispheres. The result is the formation of a single frontal lobe and a single ventricle. This abnormality also is associated with midfacial defects such as the formation of a single centrally located eye. Holoprosencephaly is seen with the fetal alco-hol syndrome and trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome).\n\n【22】PATHOLOGY PEARLS\n\n【23】The neural tube closes early in pregnancy， often before pregnancy is diagnosed.\n\n【24】Folic acid supplementation reduces the incidence of neural tube defects when taken before conception.\n\n【25】Neural tube defects are quite common and range in clinical signifi-cance from minimal to devastating.\n\n【26】Prenatal screening and diagnosis allow for detection by means of maternal serum screening early in pregnancy.

This woman has additional risk factors of having her  删除换行 fourth delivery and having a history of PPH. As she is already very anaemic, she may decom删除8：<u>￾</u>pensate easily if blood loss occurs, increasing her likelihood of hypovolaemic shock and need  删除换行 for emergency blood transfusion.\n\n【33】Further investigation\n\n【34】Although the likely cause of these indices is iron deficiency, differential diagnoses include a  删除换行 mixed folate and iron deficiency, thalassaemia, chronic bleeding or anaemia of chronic dis删除8：<u>￾</u>ease (e.g. renal disease). A full history should therefore be taken to exclude chronic diseases  删除换行 and to elicit any family history of thalassaemia.\n\n【35】Iron deficiency should be demonstrated with findings of low mean cell haemoglobin (MCH)  删除换行 and low serum ferritin. Ferritin below 12 mg/L confirms the diagnosis. Serum and red cell  删除换行 folate should also be checked and the woman should be screened for haemoglobinopathies.\n\n【36】If chronic disease is suspected, then further investigations may be indicated such as renal  删除换行 and liver function tests for chronic disease, or gastrointestinal tract endoscopy for causes of  删除换行 chronic bleeding.\n\n【37】Further management\n\n【38】Correction of anaemia\n\n【39】• The woman should be prescribed ferrous sulphate 200 mg twice daily, increasing to  删除换行 three times if tolerated. If iron tablets are not tolerated then alternatives include iron  删除换行 suspension or parenteral (intramuscular) iron injections.

She states that she sustained a twisting injury to the left ankle about 1 year ago and still has pain, which she treats with ibuprofen and heat packs. No previous treatments have been attempted.

What is the most likely diagnosis, and what is the pathogenesis?\n\n【5】ii. What histologic findings are seen on skin biopsy?\n\n【6】iii. What additional concerns are associated with this condition?\n\n【7】Answer 97\n\n【8】i. This patient’s history and clinical findings are consistent with erythema ab igne, also referred to as fire stains or toasted skin syndrome. It is characterized by localized areas of reticulated erythema and hyperpigmentation due to chronic exposure to heat below the threshold of a thermal burn. Initially, the macular colour changes are transient and easily blanchable. As heat exposure continues over time, it leads to dusky hyperpigmentation that leads to fixed colour changes that are no longer blanchable. Later lesions of erythema ab igne can demonstrate epidermal atrophy, appear keratotic or lead to bullae formation. Although, the exact pathophysiology is unknown, repeated exposure to heat below 45°C (113°F) results in a reticulated erythema in a pattern that corresponds with the dermal venous plexus. Common heat sources reported to cause erythema ab igne include heating pads, hot water bottles, heating blankets, heated car seats, heated reclining chairs and laptops/computers (often affecting the anterior thighs). Additional causes include open fires, coal stoves, steam radiators and electric stoves/heaters.\n\n【9】ii. On skin biopsy, early histopathologic changes are epidermal atrophy, vasodilation and dermal pigmentation with melanin and hemosiderin. Later lesions of erythema ab igne demonstrate more prominent epidermal atrophy with flattening of the rete ridges. Focal hyperkeratosis and dyskeratosis with squamous atypia can be seen. Lesions in the legs demonstrate more prominent hemosiderin deposition and prominent telangiectasias.\n\n【10】iii. Due to the presence of epidermal atypia, which is comparable to that of actinic keratoses, the possible development of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma or Merkel cell carcinoma is a major long-term concern associated with erythema ab igne.

Kidney stones(more likely to be uric acid rather than calcium oxalate stones) are twice as prevalent as the general population.\n\n【30】Is the kidney involvement usually unilateral or bilateral?\n\n【31】The disease is universally bilateral； unilateral cases reported probably represent multicystic renal dysplasia.\n\n【32】删除5：<u>121</u>\nADVANCED-LEVEL QUESTIONS\n\n【33】What do you know about the prevalence of this disease?\n\n【34】ADPKD is one of the most common hereditary disorders， being 10 times more common than sickle cell disease， 15 times more common than cystic fibrosis and 20 times more common than Huntington disease. It has a worldwide distribution. In the white population， the disease appears to occur in about 1 in 400 to 1 in 1000 people (Acta Med Scand 1957；328：1-255). Although the disease is rare in Africa and less common in American blacks than American whites， the incidence of end-stage renal disease caused by ADPKD is similar in blacks and whites. ADPKD is an important cause of renal failure， with 77% of patients dying or reaching end-stage renal disease by the age of 70 years (Kidney Int 1992；41：1311-19).\n\n【35】In which other conditions may bilateral renal cysts be observed in an ultrasonographic study?\n\n【36】Multiple simple cysts， autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease in children， tuberous sclerosis and von Hippel-Lindau syndrome.\n\n【37】What are the criteria for diagnosis of polycystic kidney disease using ultrasonography?\n\n【38】● Individuals at risk and those <30 years： presence of at least 2 renal cysts(unilateral or bilateral) is sufficient to establish a diagnosis in those with a positive family history； 5 cysts bilaterally in those with no such history 删除换行 30-60 years： at least 2 cysts in each kidney in those with a positive family history， 5 cysts bilaterally in those with no such history\n\n【39】● 260 years： at least four cysts in each kidney regardless of family history(Lancet 1994；343：824-7).\n\n【40】How would you like to manage this patient?\n\n【41】● FBC， urea and electrolytes， serum creatinine， urine microscopy， urine culture\n\n【42】Ultrasonography of the kidneys to confirm the diagnosis. Ultrasound may be equivocal in subjects under the age of 20 years. Ultrasound or renal MRI can also be used to determine total kidney volume， a measure of disease progression\n\n【43】Contrast-enhanced spiral CT head scan or MRI as a screening test for intracranial aneurysms in patients aged 18-40 years and with a family history of intracranial aneurysms or subarachnoid haemorrhage (N Engl J Med 1992；327：953-5).\n\n【44】In which other organs are cysts seen in this condition?\n\n【45】Liver (in 30% of cases)， spleen， pancreas， lungs， ovaries， testes， epididymis， thyroid， uterus， broad ligament and bladder. Women with hepatic cysts. Women with ADPKD may have massive cystic enlargement of the liver， a complication attributed to the role of oestrogens in promoting the growth of cysts. Exogenous oestrogens and repeated pregnancies are also risk factors for this complication； therefore， oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy should be avoided.\n\n【46】What are the neurological manifestations of this condition?\n\n【47】Subarachnoid haemorrhage from an intracranial berry aneurysm， causing death or neurological lesions in about 9% of patients. About 8% of ADPKD have an asymptomatic intracranial aneurysm and the prevalence is twice as high with a family history of such aneurysms or of subarachanoid haemorrhage. Typically intracranial aneurysms present as a ‘sentinel'or‘thunderclap' headache.\n\n【48】What is the pathology?\n\n【49】Cysts develop in Bowman's capsule and at other levels in the nephron， displacing kidney tissue. In the normal kidney， polycystin 1 is an integral membrane glycoprotein involved in cell-cell and/or cell-matrix interac-tion (J Am Soc Nephrol 1995；6：1125-33)； polycystin 2 is similar to a subunit of voltage-activated calcium and sodium channels， which suggests a role in regulating calcium entry (Science 1996；272：1339-42). The polycystins interact through their C-terminal cytoplasmic tails， which suggests that they may function through a common signalling pathway (Bat Genet1997；16：179-83). As activation of the intracellular calcium pathways inhib-its cell proliferation， in ADPKD， with insufficient or abnormal polycystins and impaired calcium entry， the proliferative pathways dominant， result-ing in cyst formation and ultimately renal failure. Renal function remains stable until kidney volumes reach a critical size.\n\n【50】What cardiovascular manifestations have been reported in these patients?\n\n【51】●Mitral valve prolapse in 26%\n\n【52】·Other lesions commonly seen are mitral， aortic and tricuspid valve regurgitation： adult polycysic disease of kidney with involvement of liver.\n\n【53】What are the renal manifestations of this disease?\n\n【54】· The main structural change is the formation of cysts. Cysts enlarge， lose their tubular connection and become isolated from the glomerulus， requiring transepithelial transport of solutes and fluids for further expansion. Cyst fluids have different sodium compositions， some high and others low.\n\n【55】● One of the earliest and most consistent functional abnormalities is a decrease in renal concentrating ability.\n\n【56】There may be altered endocrine function， as reflected by increased secre-tion of both renin (causing increased predilection to hypertension) and erythropoietin (resulting in better maintained haematocrit in renal failure， unlike in renal failure from other causes； rarely can result in polycythaemia).\n\n【57】What are the causes of abdominal pain in this disease? Infected cyst， haemorrage into cyst or diverticular perforation.\n\n【58】What are the complications of polycystic kidney disease?\n\n【59】· Renal complications\n\n【60】Hypertension (intrarenal activation of the renin-angiotensin system is said to be the main mechanism and hence ACE inhibitors are first-line-agents to control BP； diuretics should be avoided because hypokalaemia promotes cyst formation)\n\n【61】Pain： back pain or abdominal pain (cyst decompression may help to relieve pain but does not alter the rate of progression)\n\n【62】Gross or microscopic haematuria\n\n【63】Cyst infection (lipophilic antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria (11P such as co-trimoxazole， fluoroquinolones penetrate the cysts better and are preferred to standard antibacterial agents)\n\n【64】Renal calculi (seen in 10-20% with ADPKD and are frequently radiolu-cent and composed of uric acid)\n\n【65】Urinary tract infection including pyelonephritis\n\n【66】● Proteinuria\n删除14：<u>Q</u>\n121Polycystic kidneys\n\n【67】● Renal failure (once the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is <50 ml/min， the rate of progression is more rapid than in other primary renal disor-ders and there is a reduction in GFR of about 5 ml/min every year). About one half of the patients have normal life with adequate renal function.\n\n【68】●Extrarenal manifestations：\n\n【69】Cystic： cysts in the liver， ovary， pancreas， spleen and CNS. Unlike renal cyst formation， liver cysts seem to be influenced by female hormones. Whilst men and women have the same frequency of liver cysts， massive liver cysts are almost exclusively found in women\n\n【70】Non-cystic：\n\n【71】· Cardiac valvular abnormalities： mitral valve prolapse (seen in ~20%of ADPKD)， aortic valve abnormalities\n\n【72】●Intracranial saccular aneurysm or berry aneurysm： MR angiography is the most reliable technique of non-invasive screening among such patients.\n\n【73】Gastrointestinal： colonic diverticula， herniae of the anterior abdominal wall.\n\n【74】What do you know about the genetic transmission of this disease?\n\n【75】Polycystic kidney disease is an autosomal dominant disorder. Mutations in at least three different genes can lead to ADPKD. The PKD1 gene (encod-ing polycystin-1) is located on chromosome 16 (Cell 1994；77：881-4). The PKD2 gene (encoding polycystin-2) is situated on chromosome 4. At least one other gene containing mutations that lead to ADPKD is known to exist； its chromosomal location is not known.\n\n【76】Among the European ADPKD population， PKD1 is the cause in about85% of families and PKD2 the cause is about 15%. Compared with indi-viduals affected by PKD2， those with PKD1 have more severe disease with a higher prevalence of hypertension， an increased risk of progression into renal failure， and shorter life expectancy. Although PKD2-linked disease is clinically milder than PKD1-linked disease， it has a deleterious impact on overall life expectancy and cannot be regarded as a benign disorder(Lancet 1999；353：103-7).\n\n【77】What do you know about screening in this condition?\n\n【78】The children and siblings of patients with established ADPKD should be offered screening.\n\n【79】●Affected individuals should have their BP checked regularly and offered genetic counselling.\n\n【80】Genetic linkage analysis can be utilized in many families. Ultrasound is usually not useful before the age of 20 years.\n\n【81】What are the poor prognostic factors in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease?\n\n【82】Patients are liable to progress more rapidly if they are male or have PKD1mutations， early-onset hypertension， episodes of gross haematuria 删除10：<u>(J Am Soc Nephrol 1997；8：1560-7)</u> or a family history of hypertension in an unaf-fected person 删除10：<u>(J Am Soc Nephrol 1995；6：1643-8)</u>； however， these only account for a fraction of the variability of disease progression.\n\n【83】What are the causes of death in these patients?\n\n【84】One-third of adult patients die from renal failure； another third die from the complications of hypertension (including heart disease， intracerebral 删除换行 haemorrhage and rupture of berry aneurysm). The remaining third die from unrelated causes.\n\n【85】Are there any special treatments for this condition?\n\n【86】Basis research suggests that patients should be advised to：\n\n【87】●increase their water intake to 3 litres a day (to reduce antidiuretic hormone and cyclic AMP stimulation)\n\n【88】●limit the sodium intake (to control rhypertension or kidney cyst formation) 删除换行 avoid caffeine or methyxanthine derivatives (since they block phos-phodiesterase thereby resulting in more cyclic AMP to stimulate cyst formation) 删除换行 avoid situations that could carry a high risk of abdominal trauma， such as high-impact contact sports.\n\n【89】Are there any clinical trials being conducted in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease?\n\n【90】·The HALT PKD (Halt Progression of Polycystic Kidney Disease) study funded by NIH is comparing the combination of ACE inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker with an ACE inhibitor plus placebo\n\n【91】The TEMPO (Tolvaptan Efficacy and Safety in Management of Poly-cystic Diseases and its Outcomes) study\n\n【92】Studies of mTOR inhibitors： rapamycin as pilot study， everolimus study\n\n【93】Somatostatin study.\n\n【94】What do you know about hypertension in a pregnant woman with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease?\n\n【95】Although ACE inhibitors or an angiotensin receptor blocker are the best choice for hypertension in ADPKD， these drugs are absolutely contrain-dicated in pregnancy.Normotensive women with ADPKD and creatinine<12 mg/l typically have uncomplicated pregnancies， but 16% get new hypertension andare more likely to develop chronic hypertension(J Am Soc Nephrol 1994；5：1178-85).

Polycystic kidney disease is the most Er common genetic， life-threatening disease， affecting an estimated 12.5million people worldwide.\n\n【25】DIAGNOSIS\n\n【26】This patient has polycystic kidney disease (lesion and diagnosis) and is currently on dialysis as evidenced by the arteriovenous fistula in the arm(functional status).\n\n【27】QUESTIONS\n\n【28】How may polycystic disease present?\n\n【29】Haematuria， hypertension， urinary tract infection， pain in the lumbar region， uraemic symptoms， subarachnoid haemorrhage associated with berry aneurysm， and complications of associated liver cysts. Kidney stones(more likely to be uric acid rather than calcium oxalate stones) are twice as prevalent as the general population.\n\n【30】Is the kidney involvement usually unilateral or bilateral?\n\n【31】The disease is universally bilateral； unilateral cases reported probably represent multicystic renal dysplasia.\n\n【32】删除5：<u>121</u>\nADVANCED-LEVEL QUESTIONS\n\n【33】What do you know about the prevalence of this disease?\n\n【34】ADPKD is one of the most common hereditary disorders， being 10 times more common than sickle cell disease， 15 times more common than cystic fibrosis and 20 times more common than Huntington disease. It has a worldwide distribution. In the white population， the disease appears to occur in about 1 in 400 to 1 in 1000 people (Acta Med Scand 1957；328：1-255). Although the disease is rare in Africa and less common in American blacks than American whites， the incidence of end-stage renal disease caused by ADPKD is similar in blacks and whites. ADPKD is an important cause of renal failure， with 77% of patients dying or reaching end-stage renal disease by the age of 70 years (Kidney Int 1992；41：1311-19).\n\n【35】In which other conditions may bilateral renal cysts be observed in an ultrasonographic study?\n\n【36】Multiple simple cysts， autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease in children， tuberous sclerosis and von Hippel-Lindau syndrome.\n\n【37】What are the criteria for diagnosis of polycystic kidney disease using ultrasonography?\n\n【38】● Individuals at risk and those <30 years： presence of at least 2 renal cysts(unilateral or bilateral) is sufficient to establish a diagnosis in those with a positive family history； 5 cysts bilaterally in those with no such history 删除换行 30-60 years： at least 2 cysts in each kidney in those with a positive family history， 5 cysts bilaterally in those with no such history\n\n【39】● 260 years： at least four cysts in each kidney regardless of family history(Lancet 1994；343：824-7).\n\n【40】How would you like to manage this patient?\n\n【41】● FBC， urea and electrolytes， serum creatinine， urine microscopy， urine culture\n\n【42】Ultrasonography of the kidneys to confirm the diagnosis. Ultrasound may be equivocal in subjects under the age of 20 years. Ultrasound or renal MRI can also be used to determine total kidney volume， a measure of disease progression\n\n【43】Contrast-enhanced spiral CT head scan or MRI as a screening test for intracranial aneurysms in patients aged 18-40 years and with a family history of intracranial aneurysms or subarachnoid haemorrhage (N Engl J Med 1992；327：953-5).\n\n【44】In which other organs are cysts seen in this condition?\n\n【45】Liver (in 30% of cases)， spleen， pancreas， lungs， ovaries， testes， epididymis， thyroid， uterus， broad ligament and bladder. Women with hepatic cysts. Women with ADPKD may have massive cystic enlargement of the liver， a complication attributed to the role of oestrogens in promoting the growth of cysts. Exogenous oestrogens and repeated pregnancies are also risk factors for this complication； therefore， oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy should be avoided.\n\n【46】What are the neurological manifestations of this condition?\n\n【47】Subarachnoid haemorrhage from an intracranial berry aneurysm， causing death or neurological lesions in about 9% of patients. About 8% of ADPKD have an asymptomatic intracranial aneurysm and the prevalence is twice as high with a family history of such aneurysms or of subarachanoid haemorrhage. Typically intracranial aneurysms present as a ‘sentinel'or‘thunderclap' headache.\n\n【48】What is the pathology?\n\n【49】Cysts develop in Bowman's capsule and at other levels in the nephron， displacing kidney tissue. In the normal kidney， polycystin 1 is an integral membrane glycoprotein involved in cell-cell and/or cell-matrix interac-tion (J Am Soc Nephrol 1995；6：1125-33)； polycystin 2 is similar to a subunit of voltage-activated calcium and sodium channels， which suggests a role in regulating calcium entry (Science 1996；272：1339-42). The polycystins interact through their C-terminal cytoplasmic tails， which suggests that they may function through a common signalling pathway (Bat Genet1997；16：179-83). As activation of the intracellular calcium pathways inhib-its cell proliferation， in ADPKD， with insufficient or abnormal polycystins and impaired calcium entry， the proliferative pathways dominant， result-ing in cyst formation and ultimately renal failure. Renal function remains stable until kidney volumes reach a critical size.\n\n【50】What cardiovascular manifestations have been reported in these patients?\n\n【51】●Mitral valve prolapse in 26%\n\n【52】·Other lesions commonly seen are mitral， aortic and tricuspid valve regurgitation： adult polycysic disease of kidney with involvement of liver.\n\n【53】What are the renal manifestations of this disease?\n\n【54】· The main structural change is the formation of cysts. Cysts enlarge， lose their tubular connection and become isolated from the glomerulus， requiring transepithelial transport of solutes and fluids for further expansion. Cyst fluids have different sodium compositions， some high and others low.\n\n【55】● One of the earliest and most consistent functional abnormalities is a decrease in renal concentrating ability.\n\n【56】There may be altered endocrine function， as reflected by increased secre-tion of both renin (causing increased predilection to hypertension) and erythropoietin (resulting in better maintained haematocrit in renal failure， unlike in renal failure from other causes； rarely can result in polycythaemia).\n\n【57】What are the causes of abdominal pain in this disease? Infected cyst， haemorrage into cyst or diverticular perforation.\n\n【58】What are the complications of polycystic kidney disease?\n\n【59】· Renal complications\n\n【60】Hypertension (intrarenal activation of the renin-angiotensin system is said to be the main mechanism and hence ACE inhibitors are first-line-agents to control BP； diuretics should be avoided because hypokalaemia promotes cyst formation)\n\n【61】Pain： back pain or abdominal pain (cyst decompression may help to relieve pain but does not alter the rate of progression)\n\n【62】Gross or microscopic haematuria\n\n【63】Cyst infection (lipophilic antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria (11P such as co-trimoxazole， fluoroquinolones penetrate the cysts better and are preferred to standard antibacterial agents)\n\n【64】Renal calculi (seen in 10-20% with ADPKD and are frequently radiolu-cent and composed of uric acid)\n\n【65】Urinary tract infection including pyelonephritis\n\n【66】● Proteinuria\n删除14：<u>Q</u>\n121Polycystic kidneys\n\n【67】● Renal failure (once the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is <50 ml/min， the rate of progression is more rapid than in other primary renal disor-ders and there is a reduction in GFR of about 5 ml/min every year). About one half of the patients have normal life with adequate renal function.\n\n【68】●Extrarenal manifestations：\n\n【69】Cystic： cysts in the liver， ovary， pancreas， spleen and CNS. Unlike renal cyst formation， liver cysts seem to be influenced by female hormones. Whilst men and women have the same frequency of liver cysts， massive liver cysts are almost exclusively found in women\n\n【70】Non-cystic：\n\n【71】· Cardiac valvular abnormalities： mitral valve prolapse (seen in ~20%of ADPKD)， aortic valve abnormalities\n\n【72】●Intracranial saccular aneurysm or berry aneurysm： MR angiography is the most reliable technique of non-invasive screening among such patients.\n\n【73】Gastrointestinal： colonic diverticula， herniae of the anterior abdominal wall.\n\n【74】What do you know about the genetic transmission of this disease?\n\n【75】Polycystic kidney disease is an autosomal dominant disorder. Mutations in at least three different genes can lead to ADPKD. The PKD1 gene (encod-ing polycystin-1) is located on chromosome 16 (Cell 1994；77：881-4). The PKD2 gene (encoding polycystin-2) is situated on chromosome 4. At least one other gene containing mutations that lead to ADPKD is known to exist； its chromosomal location is not known.\n\n【76】Among the European ADPKD population， PKD1 is the cause in about85% of families and PKD2 the cause is about 15%. Compared with indi-viduals affected by PKD2， those with PKD1 have more severe disease with a higher prevalence of hypertension， an increased risk of progression into renal failure， and shorter life expectancy. Although PKD2-linked disease is clinically milder than PKD1-linked disease， it has a deleterious impact on overall life expectancy and cannot be regarded as a benign disorder(Lancet 1999；353：103-7).\n\n【77】What do you know about screening in this condition?\n\n【78】The children and siblings of patients with established ADPKD should be offered screening.\n\n【79】●Affected individuals should have their BP checked regularly and offered genetic counselling.\n\n【80】Genetic linkage analysis can be utilized in many families. Ultrasound is usually not useful before the age of 20 years.\n\n【81】What are the poor prognostic factors in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease?\n\n【82】Patients are liable to progress more rapidly if they are male or have PKD1mutations， early-onset hypertension， episodes of gross haematuria 删除10：<u>(J Am Soc Nephrol 1997；8：1560-7)</u> or a family history of hypertension in an unaf-fected person 删除10：<u>(J Am Soc Nephrol 1995；6：1643-8)</u>； however， these only account for a fraction of the variability of disease progression.\n\n【83】What are the causes of death in these patients?\n\n【84】One-third of adult patients die from renal failure； another third die from the complications of hypertension (including heart disease， intracerebral 删除换行 haemorrhage and rupture of berry aneurysm). The remaining third die from unrelated causes.\n\n【85】Are there any special treatments for this condition?\n\n【86】Basis research suggests that patients should be advised to：\n\n【87】●increase their water intake to 3 litres a day (to reduce antidiuretic hormone and cyclic AMP stimulation)\n\n【88】●limit the sodium intake (to control rhypertension or kidney cyst formation) 删除换行 avoid caffeine or methyxanthine derivatives (since they block phos-phodiesterase thereby resulting in more cyclic AMP to stimulate cyst formation) 删除换行 avoid situations that could carry a high risk of abdominal trauma， such as high-impact contact sports.\n\n【89】Are there any clinical trials being conducted in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease?\n\n【90】·The HALT PKD (Halt Progression of Polycystic Kidney Disease) study funded by NIH is comparing the combination of ACE inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker with an ACE inhibitor plus placebo\n\n【91】The TEMPO (Tolvaptan Efficacy and Safety in Management of Poly-cystic Diseases and its Outcomes) study\n\n【92】Studies of mTOR inhibitors： rapamycin as pilot study， everolimus study\n\n【93】Somatostatin study.\n\n【94】What do you know about hypertension in a pregnant woman with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease?\n\n【95】Although ACE inhibitors or an angiotensin receptor blocker are the best choice for hypertension in ADPKD， these drugs are absolutely contrain-dicated in pregnancy.Normotensive women with ADPKD and creatinine<12 mg/l typically have uncomplicated pregnancies， but 16% get new hypertension andare more likely to develop chronic hypertension(J Am Soc Nephrol 1994；5：1178-85). Pregnant patients with ADPKD have higher frequency of maternal complications (particularly hypertension， oedema and pre-eclampsia) than patients without ADPKD (35% vs 19%， p <0.001).\n\n【96】Further reading\n\n【97】Grantham JJ： Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease， N Engl J Med359：1477， 2007.\n\n【98】Sir W Bowman 通用删除7(英):<u>(1816-1892)</u>， Surgeon at the Royal London Ophthalmic Hospital.\n\n【99】EL Potter 通用删除7(英):<u>(1901-)</u>， US pathologist.

It is performed using a cyrogen, typically liquid nitrogen, to cool the targeted tissue to subzero temperatures.\n\n【30】This effect induces tissue damage in two mechanisms. The first mechanism is induction of tissue ischemia by damaging blood vessels and capillaries. The second mechanism damages the cells by forming ice crystals and inducing osmotic cell injury and cellular membrane disruption 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. There are several different techniques for the administration of liquid nitrogen. The most common cryosurgical technique is the open technique in which liquid nitrogen is sprayed onto the target lesion. In the semi-open technique, a cone or plate covers or directs liquid nitrogen to the target area what allows for a more targeted treatment area. The closed/contact technique uses a probe cooled with liquid nitrogen applied directly to the skin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Cryotherapy is commonly well-tolerated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Freezing of the skin’s surface causes a pain, erythema, and edema. Blistering, crusting, and hypopigmentation may be also presented. These side effects are mild for the majority of cases and resolve within one or two weeks. On the scalp or other hair-bearing areas, alopecia can result from cold-induced destruction of hair bulge cells and lead to permanent alopecia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】Cellulitis is an acute, inflammatory infection of the dermis and subcutaneous tissues. It is a rare but important complication of cryotherapy as it may lead to significant patient morbidity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Cellulitis is caused by beta-hemolytic streptococci, generally group A streptococci (i.e. Streptococcus pyogenes ), followed by the methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Risk factors for cellulitis include any breakdown in the skin barrier such as a wound or ulcer. Low temperature of liquid nitrogen initiates apoptosis of all skin cells in the treatment region, leaving the area vulnerable to infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Cellulitis typically presents as a poorly demarcated, warm, erythematous area with associated edema and tenderness to palpation. Malaise, fatigue, and fever may occur. The diagnosis of cellulitis is mainly established clinically. The treatment includes systemic antibiotic such as penicillin, cephalosporin, clindamycin, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, doxycycline and vancomycin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【32】Differential diagnoses for the presented patient included herpes zoster, erysipelas and erosive pustular dermatosis of the scalp.\n\n【33】Herpes zoster is a result of reactivation of latent varicella zoster virus. The disease most frequently occurs in older adults. It presents as painful, unilateral dermatomal, vesicular lesions on the erythematous background that do not cross the midline. Crusts can be also presented. The most common locations are the thoracic nerves and the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【34】Erosive pustular dermatosis of the scalp is a rare, inflammatory disorder that occurs mostly in elderly patients. Clinically, it is characterized by recurrent pustules, inflamed erosions and grey, yellow or yellow-brown crusts that lead to scarring alopecia. No fever is observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【35】Erysipelas is considered as a form of cellulitis. However, it is a more superficial infection affecting the upper dermis and superficial lymphatic system. It caused by group A streptococci ( Streptococcus pyogenes ) . On the contrary to cellulitis, which tends to be more mildly erythematous (pink) and flat with less distinct boundaries, erysipelas is characterized by a bright red erythema, elevation of the affected skin, and well-demarcated borders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【36】In the presented patient diagnosis of liquid nitrogen cryotherapy cellulitis was established. She was treated with intravenous cefuroxime (1.5 g three times a day) for 14 days. Complete resolution of skin lesions with hair regrowth was observed.\n\n【37】Key Points\n\n【38】   Cellulitis is an acute inflammatory infection of the dermis and subcutaneous tissues that may affect the scalp area.\n\n【39】   It typically presents as a poorly demarcated, warm, erythematous area with associated edema and tenderness to palpation.\n\n【40】   Cellulitis may be induced by liquid nitrogen cryotherapy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 14:06:51", "endTime": "2024/09/12 14:07:06", "cost": 15.701}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:32", "update_time": "2024-09-11 22:07:07", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 22:06:51"}

After treatment with mannitol and furosemidum for 5 days, infusion of calf serum deproteinized and cefuroxime for one week, his mental state improved. With continuing to take vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> for 3 weeks, his EEG recovered at one month of illness.\n\n【20】The best time to apply IVIG to KD patients is 5-7 days of illness onset. Earlier (<4 days) application of IVIG causes patients prone to IVIG intolerance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. After receiving infusion of full dose IVIG on Day 4, he had fever again. It may be due to either serious disease or relevance to earlier IVIG applications.\n\n【21】### 16.1.5 Case Specific Clinical Features\n\n【22】1.  1.\n\n【23】    A mass was found in echo since one month of illness. We do not know if this mass was primary tumor, or a mass secondary to KD. It was about 17 mm within the first month of KD onset, and the progress was a little bit fast by about 7 mm in the following 6 months. We deduced that it was an original mass occurred before KD onset. It is possible that sonographers focused on changes in coronary artery but missed those in left ventricular cavities. Whether the tumor was originated at left ventricle as suggested in ultrasound, or originated from the pericardium as suggested in MR, this mass/tumor was not in consistence with the left atrial myxoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Thus, we deduced it was a common cardiac fibroma, a benign tumor in heart muscle.\n\n【24】2.  2.\n\n【25】    Left ventricular mass is a rare condition, of which the most common is thrombus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, and this boy happened to have KD, and he was in a high coagulation stage with thrombocytopenia (PLT was 634×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L). Echo is a very useful modality of investigation to evaluate the mass of left ventricle. This boy’s echo showed the mass’s feature was similar to ventricle rather than thrombus. Cardiac MRI also confirmed that the mass was a tumor rather than a thrombus. Thus, he was not given warfarin, and was followed up only 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】3.  3.\n\n【27】    The tumor grew fast and its edge was not clear. Cardiac MRI showed it was connected with pericardium. The prognosis might not be good once it passes through the left ventricular wall and penetrates into the left ventricular cavity, making it difficult to be removed completely and prone to recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】4.  4.\n\n【29】    The boy had vomit, without abdominal pain and fever. Serum lipase is slightly elevated on Day 15. Abdominal CT showed intestinal bloating, multiple mesenteric lymphadenectasis, but pancreas had no congestion and edema. Three days later, serum amylase 98U/L, serum lipase 65.4U/L, urine amylase 871U/L indicated he had developed pancreatitis.

{"id": 2314138, "user_id": "65dea7050c9e908864e3bcde", "user_name": "焦瀚远", "task_id": 1825, "source_info": {"seq_id": "c6f08656-bd2f-4241-ba26-212104954fc6", "title": null, "text": "【0】### CASE 40\n\n【1】A 28-year-old woman presents for an evaluation of infertility. She and her husband have been attempting to conceive unsuccessfully for a year. She has never been pregnant. She has a history of irregular menstrual cycles, which were treated with oral contraceptive pills for 5 years. She has not taken contraceptives in the past 3 years. She has no other medical history, she takes no medications, and there is no family history of infertility. She does not smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol. Her routine physical and gynecologic examinations are normal. Blood tests were also normal. Basal body temperature charts that she brings in with her show no midcycle temperature elevation, and home urine ovulation prediction tests have all been negative. Her husband has already seen his physician, had a normal examination, and has had a normal semen analysis. She is diagnosed with infertility secondary to anovulation and started on clomiphene citrate.\n\n【2】 What is the mechanism of action of clomiphene?\n\n【3】 How does clomiphene induce ovulation?\n\n【4】Antiestrogens and SERMs Fulvestrant is a pure antiestrogen that antagonizes the action of estrogen in all tissues examined. Clomiphene is a partial agonist that consists of two isomers, cis \\-clomiphene and trans \\-clomiphene. Cis \\-clomiphene is a weak estrogen agonist, whereas trans-clomiphene is a potent estrogen antagonist. Clomiphene binds to both ER <sub>α </sub> and ER <sub>β </sub> , and blocks estrogen activation of these receptors. The major pharmacologic action of clomiphene is to block estrogen- mediated negative feedback in the pituitary. This increases the amplitude of LH and FSH pulses and induces ovulation in women with amenorrhea, Stein-Leventhal syndrome, and dysfunctional bleeding with anovulatory cycles. It does increase the number of ova released, thereby increasing the chances of twinning.\n\n【5】Fulvestrant is a 7 α \\-alkylamide derivative of estradiol that binds to both ER <sub>α </sub> and ER <sub>β </sub> . It is administered as a depot injection. The predominant action of fulvestrant is to increase the degradation of ER <sub>α </sub> while having little effect on ER <sub>β </sub> . This alteration in the ratio of ER <sub>α </sub> /ER <sub>β </sub> may explain its usefulness in women with tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer. Adverse effects of the antiestrogens include hot flashes, ovarian enlargement, and nausea.\n\n【6】The SERMs, tamoxifen, raloxifene, and toremifene, are a class of compounds that display a range of agonist to antagonist activities in a tissue-specific manner. For example, tamoxifen is an estrogen receptor antagonist in the breast but is a weak estrogen agonist in the endometrium. The basis for this tissue specificity is a combination of drug-induced conformational changes in the receptor, and the complement of coactivators expressed in a given cell type. As noted above, when estradiol binds to an ER, a conformational change occurs that facilitates an interaction between coactivator proteins and ER. The SERMs also bind to ER, but they induce a conformation that is different from that caused by estradiol. The configuration of the receptor dictates which coactivator can bind to the receptor; if a cell does not express a coactivator that can bind to the receptor, then the effect of drug binding will be antagonism in that cell type. If the cell does express a coactivator that recognizes a particular configuration, then the drug will have agonist (or partial agonist) activity.\n\n【7】Tamoxifen is a triphenylethylene, is structurally related to diethylstilbestrol, and binds to both ER <sub>β </sub> and ER <sub>β </sub> . It acts as an estrogen antagonist in the breast and in the brain, but it has weak estrogen agonist activity in the uterus and in bone. It has mixed action in the liver, decreasing total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol but with no effect on triglycerides. Tamoxifen is highly efficacious in the treatment of breast cancer in ER positive tumors. Tamoxifen has been shown consistently to increase disease-free survival and overall survival; treatment for 5 years has reduced cancer recurrence by approximately 50 percent and death by nearly 30 percent. It is approved for primary prevention of breast cancer in women at high risk, where it causes a 50 percent decrease in the incidence of invasive breast cancer and a 50 percent reduction of noninvasive breast cancer. Because of the development of drug-resistant tumors, treatment should last for no more than 5 years. Adverse effects of tamoxifen include hot flashes, nausea, and vaginal bleeding.\n\n【8】Toremifene also is a triphenylethylene with a chlorine substitution. It is also used for the treatment and prophylaxis of breast cancer.\n\n【9】Raloxifene is a polyhydroxylated nonsteroidal compound with a benzothiophene core. Raloxifene binds with high affinity for both ER <sub>α </sub> and ER <sub>β </sub> . Raloxifene is an estrogen agonist in bone, where it exerts an antiresorptive effect. It reduces total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. Raloxifene does not have agonist activity in the uterus. Its primary use is the prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Adverse effects include hot flashes, deep vein thrombosis, and cramps in the lower extremities.\n\n【10】Aromatase inhibitors include exemestane, anastrazole, and letrozole. These agents act by reducing the peripheral conversion of precursors such as androstenedione and testosterone into estrogens. They significantly suppress serum estradiol levels and offer an alternative to tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with receptor-positive breast cancer.\n\n【11】Antiprogestins Mifepristone (RU-486) is a 19-nor steroid that has both antiprogestational and antiglucocorticoid effects. It is used most commonly as an abortifacient in the first trimester of pregnancy. A single oral dose of mifepristone combined with a vaginal suppository containing prostaglandin E <sub>1 </sub> is effective in terminating pregnancy in approximately 95 percent of cases if used in the first 7 weeks of gestation. Adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramping.\n\n【12】Androgens and Antiandrogens Testosterone produced by the testes is the major androgen in humans. In many peripheral tissues, testosterone is converted to dihydrotestosterone by the enzyme 5α-reductase. Most circulating testosterone is bound in the plasma to sex-steroid binding globulin (SSBG). Testicular production of testosterone is regulated by LH released from the pituitary in a manner similar to that of estrogen as previously described. Testosterone has two physiologic actions. As an anabolic agent it promotes linear bone growth and development of internal genitalia, and increases muscle mass. As an androgenic agent, it is responsible for the development of male secondary sexual characteristics. Dihydrotestosterone is responsible for the development of external genitalia and hair follicle growth during puberty. Testosterone or dihydrotestosterone binds with high affinity to the androgen receptor (AR), another member of the nuclear receptor family of transcription factors.\n\n【13】There are two distinct chemical classes of androgens: testosterone and its esters and the 17-alkyl androgens. Testosterone esters include testosterone enanthate, testosterone cypionate, and testosterone undecanoate. The 17-alkyl androgens include methyltestosterone, oxandrolone, danazol, and stanozolol. Testosterone and its esters are administered either as depot injections via transdermal patch or as a gel. The 17-alkyl androgens are orally active.\n\n【14】The major use of the androgens is the treatment of male hypogonadism, both in adults and in prepubertal boys who produce low amounts of testosterone. Use in adults has been reported to increase libido, reduce senescence, and reduce the rate of bone resorption. The major adverse effects of testosterone and its esters are caused by the androgenic actions, which are especially apparent in women and prepubertal children. In women, these adverse effects include hirsutism, acne, amenorrhea, and a thickening of the vocal chords. In children, androgens can cause premature closure of the epiphyses. In men, androgens can produce azoospermia, decreased testicle size, and prostatic hyperplasia. The major adverse effects of the 17-alkyl androgens include masculinization and also serious hepatotoxicity. A cholestatic jaundice that is reversible on discontinuation of drug may occur.\n\n【15】Antiandrogens Abnormal growth of the prostate is usually dependent on androgenic stimulation. This hormonal stimulation can be reduced by orchidectomy or high doses of estrogens, but either of these treatments may be undesirable. Chemical orchiectomy can be accomplished with an inhibitor of GnRH synthesis such as leuprolide or with antiandrogens.\n\n【16】Finasteride and dutasteride are steroid derivatives that competitively inhibit 5α-reductase type II. Because prostate growth is dependent on DHT rather than testosterone, blockade of the enzyme can reduce stimulation of the gland. In clinical trials, finasteride decreased the incidence of prostate cancers but may have led to more aggressive tumors. Abiraterone is a potent inhibitor of CYP17 and thereby blocks the metabolism of pregnenolone to androgens. It is effective in the treatment of metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer. Bicalutamide and nilutamide are moderately potent antiandrogens that antagonize AR. These drugs are usually combined with a GnRH analog such as leuprolide to decrease LH and subsequently testosterone production. Flutamide is an AR antagonist that blocks the action of testosterone in target organs. It has been used in the treatment of prostatic carcinoma.\n\n【17】####", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 14:04:17", "endTime": "2024/09/12 14:04:50", "cost": 32.914}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:32", "update_time": "2024-09-11 22:04:49", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 22:04:16"}

Orthostatic hypotension\n\n【4】D. Cardiogenic syncope\n\n【5】Answer: 16.1 B . This is most likely caused by a vasovagal reflex (drop in blood pressure) in response to painful or emotionally charged stimulus and is usually non-life-threatening.

As the testicular tumour gradually enlarges,  删除换行 the spermatic cord may be thickened due to cremasteric  删除换行 hypertrophy to pull up the heavy testis and engorgement  删除换行 of testicular vessels.

Chest radiography and whole lung tomography — \n\n【26】is essential in teratoma. This is done to detect pulmonary  删除换行 metastasis or detection of enlargement of pulmonary and  删除换行 mediastinal lymph nodes. Paravertebral nodal masses and  删除换行 enlargement of paratracheal nodes may also be detected  删除换行 by this investigation.\n\n【27】2. Lymphography.— This is performed to detect  删除换行 involvement of para-aortic lymph nodes. Being in the  删除换行 abdomen it is difficult to palpate slight enlargement of  删除换行 these lymph nodes.

As soon as the diagnosis is confirmed (i) inguinal 删除换行 orchidectomy with high cord ligation at the deep inguinal 删除换行 ring is mandatory.\n\n【43】B. Then the treatment defers according to the  删除换行 histopathological report of the testis whether it is  删除换行 seminoma or teratoma.\n\n【44】The main objects of the operation 删除换行 are :—\n\n【45】(a) Removal of the primary tumour.\n\n【46】(b) To obtain the biopsy specimen for  删除换行 histopathological report, which helps further treatment  删除换行 of the secondaries. This is the best form of getting the  删除换行 biopsy specimen without disturbing the tunica albuginea,  删除换行 which acts as a barrier for direct spread of the tumour  删除换行 mass.\n\n【47】Technique.— Through an inguinal incision the  删除换行 inguinal canal is opened. The spermatic cord is dissected  删除换行 out. It is ligated at the level of the deep inguinal ring  删除换行 and then divided just distal to the ligature. The incision  删除换行 is extended downwards to the scrotum.The spermatic cord  删除换行 is gradually dissected from the surrounding tissues  删除换行 downwards and ultimately the spermatic cord alongwith  删除换行 the testis is removed.\n\n【48】After orchidectomy, there may be recurrence in the  删除换行 scrotal skin. Some surgeons advise haemiscrotectomy i.e. \n\n【49】excision of that half of the scrotum together with  删除换行 orchidectomy.\n\n【50】When the diagnosis is in doubt, it is better to explore the  删除换行 affected testis.\n\n【51】Exploration.— A soft clamp is applied at the spermatic  删除换行 cord to prevent dissemination of the malignant cells. The  删除换行 testis is opened up by making a small incision on the  删除换行 tunica albuginea. The suspected part is excised and then  删除换行 sent for frozen section biopsy. The tunica albuginea is  删除换行 closed carefully. If the histopathological report goes in  删除换行 favour of malignancy, orchidectomy is performed through  删除换行 inguinal incision with division of the cord-at the deep  删除换行 inguinal ring.\n\n【52】for seminoma and teratoma  删除换行 differs. The treatments are as follows :\n\n【53】ENCYSTED HYDROCELE OF THE\n\n【54】CORD.—\n\n【55】Testicular seminoma is a remarkably radiosensitive  删除换行 tumour and vigorous attempt should be made to irradiate  删除换行 the tumour even in patients with advanced disease.\n\n【56】Stage I.— Radiation therapy is given to the para-aortic  删除换行 and ipsilateral pelvic lymph nodes, the field extending  删除换行 from DIO-11 interspace to the lower border of the  删除换行 obturator foramen. Anterior and posterior fields are  删除换行 treated alternatively. The fields extend laterally to the  删除换行 hila of the kidneys. The contralateral testis is protected  删除换行 from scattered radiation by means of thick lead cup. It is  删除换行 preferable to use high energy X-rays — either 6 MeV or  删除换行 8 MeV linear accelator is employed. The penetrating  删除换行 beam of this apparatus facilitates irradiation of deeply  删除换行 seated structures such as the retroperitoneal lymph nodes  删除换行 with high doses resulting in short treatment exposures,  删除换行 and the sharply defined beam edges which minimize  删除换行 irradiation to critical adjacent structures such as kidney  删除换行 and testis. A midpoint dose of 3000 rads is derived in  删除换行 3V2 to 4 weeks time. In case the scrotal sac is involved — \n\n【57】the scrotal sac is irradiated and the inguinal nodes are  删除换行 included in the fields. The scrotal sac is treated with  删除换行 orthovoltage X-rays (250 K.V.) and the groin nodes by  删除换行 extending the megavoltage field. A lead shield is always  删除换行 prepared which protects the contralateral testis.\n\n【58】Stage II.— If the lymphogram is positive, a similar  删除换行 field is used and in this case the dose to the involved  删除换行 nodes is increased to 3500 rads. Following completion of  删除换行 the abdominal radiation and after a period of 4 weeks the 删除换行 mediastinal and supraclavicular nodes are irradiated.\n\n【59】Stage III.— The approach is identical to that  删除换行 mentioned in stage II.\n\n【60】Stage IV.— \n\n【61】67Ga scan is a useful method of detecting  删除换行 the sites affected by seminoma. A few organs may be  删除换行 irradiated as seminoma is basically a radiosensitive  删除换行 tumour. Thus for example, pulmonary and hepatic  删除换行 irradiation may be carried out with some prospect of  删除换行 success. Irradiation may be preceded or followed by  删除换行 chemotherapy. In presence of widespread disease the best  删除换行 plan is to attempt to irradiate all identifiable disease and  删除换行 then to follow this with chemotherapy. A combination  删除换行 chemotherapy containing cis-platinum has been very  删除换行 effective in treating testicular tumour. With this  删除换行 treatment 40% survival has been seen at the end of 36  删除换行 months.\n\n【62】HYDROCELE EN BISAC OR\n\n【63】BILOCULAR HYDROCELE —\n\n【64】Stage I.— The treatment policy is almost similar to  删除换行 that described for seminoma, however the radiation dose  删除换行 to the nodes is increased to 4,000 to 4,500 rads in 4 to  删除换行 5V2 weeks.\n\n【65】Stage II.— In this particular group controversies still  删除换行 exist between radical node dissection and radiotherapy. \n\n【66】To chalk out best plan of treatment stage II teratoma can  删除换行 be divided into two groups :— Ila (small volume lymph  删除换行 node metastasis) and lib (bulky lymph node metastasis). \n\n【67】The cure rate in these two groups is strikingly differentTESTIS, EPIDIDYMIS AND SCROTUM 243 删除换行 with 80% cure rate in stage Ila, whereas 35% in stage  删除换行 lib.\n\n【68】Stage Ila patients should receive irradiation as described  删除换行 for stage I. 4,000 to 4,500 rads to the entire field and a  删除换行 minimum dose of 5,000 rads to the tumour bearing  删除换行 nodes. Following this and after an interval of 4 weeks,  删除换行 supradiaphragmatic irradiation is carried out.\n\n【69】In stage lib the problems are formidable. The present  删除换行 approach is to attempt to shrink the nodal metastasis  删除换行 with chemotherapy, followed by irradiation and surgery 删除换行 is considered for residual disease.\n\n【70】Excision of the residual lumps requires careful  删除换行 preoperative localisation by CT scanning, so that  删除换行 optimum surgical approach can be planned. The relation  删除换行 of the mass to the renal vessels is of paramount importance.\n\n【71】Stage I and Ila patients are followed closely after  删除换行 radiation therapy with chest X-rays and CT scan at  删除换行 monthly intervals for the first 6 months and at 2-monthly  删除换行 intervals for 1 year. Whole lung tomography may be  删除换行 performed at intervals during this follow-up period. Early  删除换行 detection of lung metastasis should be followed by  删除换行 chemotherapy and lung irradiation.\n\n【72】Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection or radical  删除换行 excision of the retroperitoneal lymph nodes.— This  删除换行 operation is more popular in United Stares. Whether this  删除换行 operation is always justified or not is a controversial issue. \n\n【73】In many series published in U.S.A. the survival of patients  删除换行 with positive nodes was 48.6%, which is almost similar  删除换行 to studies from Great Britain for lymphographic stage II \n\n【74】patients who were treated by irradiation. Irradiation also  删除换行 minimises unnecessary radical retroperitoneal node  删除换行 dissection for histologically-negative lymph nodes. There  删除换行 is no evidence at present to suggest superiority of either  删除换行 irradiation or lymphadenectomy in the management of  删除换行 retroperitoneal node metastasis from testicular teratoma.\n\n【75】CT scan should be performed to detect the exact  删除换行 position of the mass and its relation. A long midline  删除换行 incision provides excellent access for the mass situated  删除换行 below the renal vessels. If the mass extends above the  删除换行 renal vessels, a thoracoabdominal incision is required. One  删除换行 can make a separate staged approach that means separate  删除换行 incisions for dissection of wide-spread retroperitoneal  删除换行 lymph node metastasis.\n\n【76】It must be remembered that more than 20% of cases  删除换行 who underwent para-aortic lymphadenectomy reported  删除换行 loss of ejaculation after operation. Whereas chemotherapy  删除换行 or radiotherapy will not have such adverse effect.\n\n【77】Stage III.— Treatment is almost identical to that  删除换行 mentioned for stage II.\n\n【78】Stage IV.— In this stage a combined chemotherapy-ra删除8：<u>￾</u>diotherapy approach is employed. Where there is more  删除换行 widespread dissemination chemotherapy alone is indicated.\n\n【79】Chemotherapy has revolutionised the treatment of  删除换行 teratoma testis. The development of effective  删除换行 chemotherapy with cis-platinum, vinblastine and  删除换行 bleomycin (PVB) for testicular cancer has been the most  删除换行 dramatic advance in oncology during the past decade. \n\n【80】Sometimes etoposide may be substituted for vinblastine  删除换行 and a combination of bleomycin, etoposide and cis删除8：<u>￾</u>platinum (BEP) was evaluated and shown to be as effective  删除换行 as PVB, but less toxic. However it must be concluded that  删除换行 ideally all residual masses should be removed after  删除换行 completion of chemotherapy, first to define whether or  删除换行 not there is active malignancy in the lump and secondly  删除换行 because complete surgical removal and follow-up  删除换行 chemotherapy appear to offer best chance of cure.\n\n【81】Patients with liver metastasis carry a particularly bad  删除换行 prognosis and the median survival for this group has been  删除换行 less than 4 months.\n\n【82】Combined chemotherapy has often been used with  删除换行 success in stage IV patients particularly where extra删除8：<u>￾</u>lymphatic spread is confined to the lungs. Chemotherapy  删除换行 is used to secure maximal tumour regression and radiation  删除换行 is then directed to the sites of initially detected disease. \n\n【83】After chemotherapy the lymph nodes (iliac, para-aortic,  删除换行 mediastinal and cervical) and both lungs are irradiated. \n\n【84】The use of chemotherapy increases the sensitivity of the  删除换行 lung to irradiation and profound changes in pulmonary  删除换行 function can occur.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【14】(f) Para-aortic lymph node enlargement may cause  删除换行 ureteric obstruction with hydronephrosis, so kidneys must\n\n【15】删除5：16\n\nbe palpated carefully.\n\n", "content": "【0】FUNICULAR HYDROCELE.—\n\n【1】(i) The body of the testis is enlarged.

Chest radiography and whole lung tomography — \n\n【26】is essential in teratoma. This is done to detect pulmonary  删除换行 metastasis or detection of enlargement of pulmonary and  删除换行 mediastinal lymph nodes. Paravertebral nodal masses and  删除换行 enlargement of paratracheal nodes may also be detected  删除换行 by this investigation.\n\n【27】2. Lymphography.— This is performed to detect  删除换行 involvement of para-aortic lymph nodes. Being in the  删除换行 abdomen it is difficult to palpate slight enlargement of  删除换行 these lymph nodes. Nodal metastasis is indicated by filling  删除换行 defect or nodal enlargement with pseudolymphomatous  删除换行 lacy appearance. In case of massively enlarged nodes there  删除换行 may be virtually no entry of contrast medium into the  删除换行 lymph node mass.\n\n【28】3. I.

As soon as the diagnosis is confirmed (i) inguinal 删除换行 orchidectomy with high cord ligation at the deep inguinal 删除换行 ring is mandatory.\n\n【43】B. Then the treatment defers according to the  删除换行 histopathological report of the testis whether it is  删除换行 seminoma or teratoma.\n\n【44】The main objects of the operation 删除换行 are :—\n\n【45】(a) Removal of the primary tumour.\n\n【46】(b) To obtain the biopsy specimen for  删除换行 histopathological report, which helps further treatment  删除换行 of the secondaries. This is the best form of getting the  删除换行 biopsy specimen without disturbing the tunica albuginea,  删除换行 which acts as a barrier for direct spread of the tumour  删除换行 mass.\n\n【47】Technique.— Through an inguinal incision the  删除换行 inguinal canal is opened. The spermatic cord is dissected  删除换行 out. It is ligated at the level of the deep inguinal ring  删除换行 and then divided just distal to the ligature. The incision  删除换行 is extended downwards to the scrotum.The spermatic cord  删除换行 is gradually dissected from the surrounding tissues  删除换行 downwards and ultimately the spermatic cord alongwith  删除换行 the testis is removed.\n\n【48】After orchidectomy, there may be recurrence in the  删除换行 scrotal skin. Some surgeons advise haemiscrotectomy i.e. \n\n【49】excision of that half of the scrotum together with  删除换行 orchidectomy.\n\n【50】When the diagnosis is in doubt, it is better to explore the  删除换行 affected testis.\n\n【51】Exploration.— A soft clamp is applied at the spermatic  删除换行 cord to prevent dissemination of the malignant cells. The  删除换行 testis is opened up by making a small incision on the  删除换行 tunica albuginea. The suspected part is excised and then  删除换行 sent for frozen section biopsy. The tunica albuginea is  删除换行 closed carefully. If the histopathological report goes in  删除换行 favour of malignancy, orchidectomy is performed through  删除换行 inguinal incision with division of the cord-at the deep  删除换行 inguinal ring.\n\n【52】for seminoma and teratoma  删除换行 differs. The treatments are as follows :\n\n【53】ENCYSTED HYDROCELE OF THE\n\n【54】CORD.—\n\n【55】Testicular seminoma is a remarkably radiosensitive  删除换行 tumour and vigorous attempt should be made to irradiate  删除换行 the tumour even in patients with advanced disease.\n\n【56】Stage I.— Radiation therapy is given to the para-aortic  删除换行 and ipsilateral pelvic lymph nodes, the field extending  删除换行 from DIO-11 interspace to the lower border of the  删除换行 obturator foramen. Anterior and posterior fields are  删除换行 treated alternatively. The fields extend laterally to the  删除换行 hila of the kidneys. The contralateral testis is protected  删除换行 from scattered radiation by means of thick lead cup. It is  删除换行 preferable to use high energy X-rays — either 6 MeV or  删除换行 8 MeV linear accelator is employed. The penetrating  删除换行 beam of this apparatus facilitates irradiation of deeply  删除换行 seated structures such as the retroperitoneal lymph nodes  删除换行 with high doses resulting in short treatment exposures,  删除换行 and the sharply defined beam edges which minimize  删除换行 irradiation to critical adjacent structures such as kidney  删除换行 and testis. A midpoint dose of 3000 rads is derived in  删除换行 3V2 to 4 weeks time. In case the scrotal sac is involved — \n\n【57】the scrotal sac is irradiated and the inguinal nodes are  删除换行 included in the fields. The scrotal sac is treated with  删除换行 orthovoltage X-rays (250 K.V.) and the groin nodes by  删除换行 extending the megavoltage field. A lead shield is always  删除换行 prepared which protects the contralateral testis.\n\n【58】Stage II.— If the lymphogram is positive, a similar  删除换行 field is used and in this case the dose to the involved  删除换行 nodes is increased to 3500 rads. Following completion of  删除换行 the abdominal radiation and after a period of 4 weeks the 删除换行 mediastinal and supraclavicular nodes are irradiated.\n\n【59】Stage III.— The approach is identical to that  删除换行 mentioned in stage II.\n\n【60】Stage IV.— \n\n【61】67Ga scan is a useful method of detecting  删除换行 the sites affected by seminoma. A few organs may be  删除换行 irradiated as seminoma is basically a radiosensitive  删除换行 tumour. Thus for example, pulmonary and hepatic  删除换行 irradiation may be carried out with some prospect of  删除换行 success. Irradiation may be preceded or followed by  删除换行 chemotherapy. In presence of widespread disease the best  删除换行 plan is to attempt to irradiate all identifiable disease and  删除换行 then to follow this with chemotherapy. A combination  删除换行 chemotherapy containing cis-platinum has been very  删除换行 effective in treating testicular tumour. With this  删除换行 treatment 40% survival has been seen at the end of 36  删除换行 months.\n\n【62】HYDROCELE EN BISAC OR\n\n【63】BILOCULAR HYDROCELE —\n\n【64】Stage I.— The treatment policy is almost similar to  删除换行 that described for seminoma, however the radiation dose  删除换行 to the nodes is increased to 4,000 to 4,500 rads in 4 to  删除换行 5V2 weeks.\n\n【65】Stage II.— In this particular group controversies still  删除换行 exist between radical node dissection and radiotherapy. \n\n【66】To chalk out best plan of treatment stage II teratoma can  删除换行 be divided into two groups :— Ila (small volume lymph  删除换行 node metastasis) and lib (bulky lymph node metastasis). \n\n【67】The cure rate in these two groups is strikingly differentTESTIS, EPIDIDYMIS AND SCROTUM 243 删除换行 with 80% cure rate in stage Ila, whereas 35% in stage  删除换行 lib.\n\n【68】Stage Ila patients should receive irradiation as described  删除换行 for stage I. 4,000 to 4,500 rads to the entire field and a  删除换行 minimum dose of 5,000 rads to the tumour bearing  删除换行 nodes. Following this and after an interval of 4 weeks,  删除换行 supradiaphragmatic irradiation is carried out.\n\n【69】In stage lib the problems are formidable. The present  删除换行 approach is to attempt to shrink the nodal metastasis  删除换行 with chemotherapy, followed by irradiation and surgery 删除换行 is considered for residual disease.\n\n【70】Excision of the residual lumps requires careful  删除换行 preoperative localisation by CT scanning, so that  删除换行 optimum surgical approach can be planned.

The incision  删除换行 is extended downwards to the scrotum.The spermatic cord  删除换行 is gradually dissected from the surrounding tissues  删除换行 downwards and ultimately the spermatic cord alongwith  删除换行 the testis is removed.\n\n【48】After orchidectomy, there may be recurrence in the  删除换行 scrotal skin. Some surgeons advise haemiscrotectomy i.e. \n\n【49】excision of that half of the scrotum together with  删除换行 orchidectomy.\n\n【50】When the diagnosis is in doubt, it is better to explore the  删除换行 affected testis.\n\n【51】Exploration.— A soft clamp is applied at the spermatic  删除换行 cord to prevent dissemination of the malignant cells. The  删除换行 testis is opened up by making a small incision on the  删除换行 tunica albuginea. The suspected part is excised and then  删除换行 sent for frozen section biopsy. The tunica albuginea is  删除换行 closed carefully. If the histopathological report goes in  删除换行 favour of malignancy, orchidectomy is performed through  删除换行 inguinal incision with division of the cord-at the deep  删除换行 inguinal ring.\n\n【52】for seminoma and teratoma  删除换行 differs. The treatments are as follows :\n\n【53】ENCYSTED HYDROCELE OF THE\n\n【54】CORD.—\n\n【55】Testicular seminoma is a remarkably radiosensitive  删除换行 tumour and vigorous attempt should be made to irradiate  删除换行 the tumour even in patients with advanced disease.\n\n【56】Stage I.— Radiation therapy is given to the para-aortic  删除换行 and ipsilateral pelvic lymph nodes, the field extending  删除换行 from DIO-11 interspace to the lower border of the  删除换行 obturator foramen. Anterior and posterior fields are  删除换行 treated alternatively. The fields extend laterally to the  删除换行 hila of the kidneys. The contralateral testis is protected  删除换行 from scattered radiation by means of thick lead cup. It is  删除换行 preferable to use high energy X-rays — either 6 MeV or  删除换行 8 MeV linear accelator is employed. The penetrating  删除换行 beam of this apparatus facilitates irradiation of deeply  删除换行 seated structures such as the retroperitoneal lymph nodes  删除换行 with high doses resulting in short treatment exposures,  删除换行 and the sharply defined beam edges which minimize  删除换行 irradiation to critical adjacent structures such as kidney  删除换行 and testis. A midpoint dose of 3000 rads is derived in  删除换行 3V2 to 4 weeks time. In case the scrotal sac is involved — \n\n【57】the scrotal sac is irradiated and the inguinal nodes are  删除换行 included in the fields. The scrotal sac is treated with  删除换行 orthovoltage X-rays (250 K.V.) and the groin nodes by  删除换行 extending the megavoltage field. A lead shield is always  删除换行 prepared which protects the contralateral testis.\n\n【58】Stage II.— If the lymphogram is positive, a similar  删除换行 field is used and in this case the dose to the involved  删除换行 nodes is increased to 3500 rads. Following completion of  删除换行 the abdominal radiation and after a period of 4 weeks the 删除换行 mediastinal and supraclavicular nodes are irradiated.\n\n【59】Stage III.— The approach is identical to that  删除换行 mentioned in stage II.\n\n【60】Stage IV.— \n\n【61】67Ga scan is a useful method of detecting  删除换行 the sites affected by seminoma. A few organs may be  删除换行 irradiated as seminoma is basically a radiosensitive  删除换行 tumour. Thus for example, pulmonary and hepatic  删除换行 irradiation may be carried out with some prospect of  删除换行 success. Irradiation may be preceded or followed by  删除换行 chemotherapy. In presence of widespread disease the best  删除换行 plan is to attempt to irradiate all identifiable disease and  删除换行 then to follow this with chemotherapy. A combination  删除换行 chemotherapy containing cis-platinum has been very  删除换行 effective in treating testicular tumour. With this  删除换行 treatment 40% survival has been seen at the end of 36  删除换行 months.\n\n【62】HYDROCELE EN BISAC OR\n\n【63】BILOCULAR HYDROCELE —\n\n【64】Stage I.— The treatment policy is almost similar to  删除换行 that described for seminoma, however the radiation dose  删除换行 to the nodes is increased to 4,000 to 4,500 rads in 4 to  删除换行 5V2 weeks.\n\n【65】Stage II.— In this particular group controversies still  删除换行 exist between radical node dissection and radiotherapy. \n\n【66】To chalk out best plan of treatment stage II teratoma can  删除换行 be divided into two groups :— Ila (small volume lymph  删除换行 node metastasis) and lib (bulky lymph node metastasis). \n\n【67】The cure rate in these two groups is strikingly differentTESTIS, EPIDIDYMIS AND SCROTUM 243 删除换行 with 80% cure rate in stage Ila, whereas 35% in stage  删除换行 lib.\n\n【68】Stage Ila patients should receive irradiation as described  删除换行 for stage I. 4,000 to 4,500 rads to the entire field and a  删除换行 minimum dose of 5,000 rads to the tumour bearing  删除换行 nodes. Following this and after an interval of 4 weeks,  删除换行 supradiaphragmatic irradiation is carried out.\n\n【69】In stage lib the problems are formidable. The present  删除换行 approach is to attempt to shrink the nodal metastasis  删除换行 with chemotherapy, followed by irradiation and surgery 删除换行 is considered for residual disease.\n\n【70】Excision of the residual lumps requires careful  删除换行 preoperative localisation by CT scanning, so that  删除换行 optimum surgical approach can be planned. The relation  删除换行 of the mass to the renal vessels is of paramount importance.\n\n【71】Stage I and Ila patients are followed closely after  删除换行 radiation therapy with chest X-rays and CT scan at  删除换行 monthly intervals for the first 6 months and at 2-monthly  删除换行 intervals for 1 year. Whole lung tomography may be  删除换行 performed at intervals during this follow-up period. Early  删除换行 detection of lung metastasis should be followed by  删除换行 chemotherapy and lung irradiation.\n\n【72】Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection or radical  删除换行 excision of the retroperitoneal lymph nodes.— This  删除换行 operation is more popular in United Stares. Whether this  删除换行 operation is always justified or not is a controversial issue. \n\n【73】In many series published in U.S.A. the survival of patients  删除换行 with positive nodes was 48.6%, which is almost similar  删除换行 to studies from Great Britain for lymphographic stage II \n\n【74】patients who were treated by irradiation. Irradiation also  删除换行 minimises unnecessary radical retroperitoneal node  删除换行 dissection for histologically-negative lymph nodes. There  删除换行 is no evidence at present to suggest superiority of either  删除换行 irradiation or lymphadenectomy in the management of  删除换行 retroperitoneal node metastasis from testicular teratoma.\n\n【75】CT scan should be performed to detect the exact  删除换行 position of the mass and its relation. A long midline  删除换行 incision provides excellent access for the mass situated  删除换行 below the renal vessels. If the mass extends above the  删除换行 renal vessels, a thoracoabdominal incision is required. One  删除换行 can make a separate staged approach that means separate  删除换行 incisions for dissection of wide-spread retroperitoneal  删除换行 lymph node metastasis.\n\n【76】It must be remembered that more than 20% of cases  删除换行 who underwent para-aortic lymphadenectomy reported  删除换行 loss of ejaculation after operation. Whereas chemotherapy  删除换行 or radiotherapy will not have such adverse effect.\n\n【77】Stage III.— Treatment is almost identical to that  删除换行 mentioned for stage II.\n\n【78】Stage IV.— In this stage a combined chemotherapy-ra删除8：<u>￾</u>diotherapy approach is employed. Where there is more  删除换行 widespread dissemination chemotherapy alone is indicated.\n\n【79】Chemotherapy has revolutionised the treatment of  删除换行 teratoma testis. The development of effective  删除换行 chemotherapy with cis-platinum, vinblastine and  删除换行 bleomycin (PVB) for testicular cancer has been the most  删除换行 dramatic advance in oncology during the past decade. \n\n【80】Sometimes etoposide may be substituted for vinblastine  删除换行 and a combination of bleomycin, etoposide and cis删除8：<u>￾</u>platinum (BEP) was evaluated and shown to be as effective  删除换行 as PVB, but less toxic. However it must be concluded that  删除换行 ideally all residual masses should be removed after  删除换行 completion of chemotherapy, first to define whether or  删除换行 not there is active malignancy in the lump and secondly  删除换行 because complete surgical removal and follow-up  删除换行 chemotherapy appear to offer best chance of cure.\n\n【81】Patients with liver metastasis carry a particularly bad  删除换行 prognosis and the median survival for this group has been  删除换行 less than 4 months.\n\n【82】Combined chemotherapy has often been used with  删除换行 success in stage IV patients particularly where extra删除8：<u>￾</u>lymphatic spread is confined to the lungs. Chemotherapy  删除换行 is used to secure maximal tumour regression and radiation  删除换行 is then directed to the sites of initially detected disease. \n\n【83】After chemotherapy the lymph nodes (iliac, para-aortic,  删除换行 mediastinal and cervical) and both lungs are irradiated. \n\n【84】The use of chemotherapy increases the sensitivity of the  删除换行 lung to irradiation and profound changes in pulmonary  删除换行 function can occur.", "index": 6742, "show": true, "start": 6729, "end": 6922, "province": ["格式规范性", "多余换行"], "isEdit": false}, {"text": "【73】In many series published in U.S.A. the survival of patients  删除换行 with positive nodes was 48.6%, which is almost similar  删除换行 to studies from Great Britain for lymphographic stage II\n\n【74】patients who were treated by irradiation.

However， given the absence of infiltrates (evidence for pneumonia) or suspicious lesions on CXR (pulmonary neoplasm)， the most likely diagnosis is exacerbation of COPD. The ECG is not suspicious for coronary ischemia although it identifies changes commonly found with pulmo-\n\n【48】nary hypertension， including right axis deviations， often seen with right ventricular enlargemeni secondary to pulmonary hypertension. The decline in ABGs is concerning. Janis is very close to acute respiratory failure and would require hospitalization if PaO and SaO were much below their current values. Since Janis is able to perform her metered dose inhaler therapies competently and she has noticeable improvement in her dyspnea with the administration of a nebulizer bronchodilator treat-ment， with adjustments in her medications， she will likely show improvement. Janis should revisit smoking cessation treatments. She is approaching the point at which home oxygen is needed (paO2less than 55mmHg； SaO2 less than or equal to 88) 删除10：<u>(Brashers，2010)</u>.\n\n【49】What is your plan of treatment?\n\n【50】Add beclomethasone dipropionate， 42 mcg/inhalation MDI， 2 puffs 3-4 times per day， and change Janis's inhaled bronchodilator therapy to a long-acting form： salmeterol 12 mcg (range 4.5-12). Oral glucocorticoid therapy may also improve her recovery. Serious discussion about smoking cessation and the addition of pulmonary rehabilitation should occur at the time of the visit. She should be seen again in 2-3 days for repeat spirometry and clinical assessment of her lungs.\n\n【51】What is your plan for follow-up care?\n\n【52】Janis may improve with pulmonary rehabilitation. Prescription or over-the-counter smoking cessa-tion medication should be recommended. She should be instructed to call in the case of increased temperature， dyspnea， or chest pain. Plan to review risk factors with Janis at the next visit， and invite her husband to attend. Working with Janis to improve overall health is essential. Smoking cessation and pulmonary rehabilitation are top evidence-based treatments for COPD 删除10：<u>(Rabe et al.， 2007)</u>. Her current trajectory places her at grave risk for continued decline and early mortality.\n\n【53】Are any referrals needed?\n\n【54】Annual evaluation by a pulmonologist is recommended. Once her condition has improved， she should also be referred to a cardiologist for further workup to rule out coronary artery disease (CAD). In light of this risk， an assessment of her lipids and an evaluation of her diet are recommended to examine other lifestyle modifications that might slow the development of CAD. With ECG evidence of right axis deviation， it is likely that her right ventricle may be enlarged secondary to pulmonary hypertension. This places her at risk for progression to heart failure (cor pulmonale). These serious affects of her condition require careful discussion so that she is fully informed of her risks and can make informed decisions about her future. Her husband should be invited to meet with the medical team to discuss his risks and how his continued smoking may be contributing to Janis's condition.\n\n【55】What additional risk factors are evident for this patient?\n\n【56】Janis is at great risk for coronary artery disease and lung cancer. She should also have an annual influenza vaccine， given her progression of disease. A pneumococcal vaccine is also advisable.\n\n【57】Are there any standardized guidelines that you should use to treat this patient?\n\n【58】Careful review of the progression and treatment recommendations 删除10：<u>(Rabe et al.， 2007)</u> provide evi-dence-based guidelines for stages of COPD.

He had been hypertensive for 15 years and wastreated with aB-adrenergic block thiazide diuretic， and a calcium channel blocker. His home blood pressure measurements aver-aged 150s/60s mm Hg. There was no history of hypokalemia. He had used tobacco in the past(60 pack-years) and 1 year ago had a contrast-enhanced pulmonary computed tomography (CT) scan to follow up lung nodules， and this detected a new 2.5-cm right adrenal mass. The referral to Mayo Clinic was to follow up on that incidental finding. The patient had no signs or symptoms of pheochromocytoma beyond sustained hyper-tension. He had no signs or symptoms of malig-nancy or infection (e.g.， no fever， cough， or weight 删除换行 loss). On physical examination his body mass index was 28.9 kg/m2， blood pressure 136/73 mmHg， and heart rate 77 beats per minute. He had no stigmata of Cushing syndrome.\n\n【5】INVESTIGATIONS\n\n【6】The baseline laboratory test results are shown in Table83.1.

MS is an immune-mediated demyelinating  删除换行 disorder, the aetiology of which is unclear. Several weak genetic factors, mainly in the genes  删除换行 regulating inflammatory mediators, are thought to interact with environmental factors. The  删除换行 idea of environmental influences was supported by observation that the incidence of MS \n\n【13】was greater at higher latitudes, with the place of childhood up to the age of 15 being key. \n\n【14】Influences such as vitamin D and various viruses have been implicated, but none of these  删除换行 have been proven conclusively. \n\n【15】The name of the disease derives from the multiple inflammatory lesions seen histopathologi删除8：<u>￾</u>cally that eventually progress to sclerosis. These are typically located in the periventricular  删除换行 areas and mainly, but not exclusively, affect white matter (myelin is macroscopically white). \n\n【16】However, the cerebellum, spinal cord, and optic nerve can be affected too. Inflammation  删除换行 and destruction of the myelin results in degeneration of the nerves associated with the myelin  删除换行 covering. Neurological deficit occurs because neurons fail in the same way that chewing the  删除换行 insulation of a fine wire causes failure of ability of the wire to transmit electrical signals. \n\n【17】Diagnosis, however, is rarely made on biopsy and is primarily based on clinical features with  删除换行 radiological corroboration. The lesions and plaques enhance with MRI contrast (gadolin删除8：<u>￾</u>ium-based compounds). Cerebrospinal fluid protein electrophoresis may show oligoclonal  删除换行 immunoglobulin G bands, a manifestation of the inflammation, but as lumbar puncture is  删除换行 an invasive procedure, this investigation is increasingly reserved for cases where MRI is con删除8：<u>￾</u>traindicated or where there is diagnostic doubt. \n\n【18】Classically, MS is described as having lesions separated in space and clinical attacks sepa删除8：<u>￾</u>rated in time. These symptoms are myriad and include visual problems (optic neuritis), as  删除换行 well as sensory, and motor symptoms include bladder, bowel, and sexual dysfunction. The  删除换行 most common clinical pattern is the relapsing-remitting form, where there are episodes of  删除换行 neurologic deficit with recovery or near resolution in between. The majority of patients with  删除换行 this form develop progressive disease, usually after 10–15 years. \n\n【19】Other patterns include primary progressive MS (10% of cases).

Painless rectal bleeding in an elderly individual (especially with a history of constipation or poor fiber intake) suggests diverticulosis, a condition in which the mucosa and submucosa herniate through the muscular layer of the GI tract (frequently along the sigmoid colon), forming pockets called diverticula. This patient’s lower left quadrant abdominal pain indicates that he is now suffering from acute diverticulitis, which is inflammation of one or more diverticula. The laboratory values show marked leukocytosis, which is actually a common finding in acute diverticulitis. More notably, the patient appears to have iron-deficient, microcytic anemia (low hemoglobin and low MCV) This could result from his past bleeding episodes; however, it could also be a sign of chronic occult bleeding from an undiagnosed carcinoma. After the patient is stabilized and the acute diverticulitis has resolved, the patient should undergo colonoscopy to rule out malignancy. Colonoscopy is contraindicated during an acute episode of diverticulitis due to increased risk of bowel perforation.  \n\n【13】Answer A is incorrect . An abdominal ultrasound can be quickly carried out in the emergency setting. It is helpful in the diagnosis of some genitourinary, gynecologic, and biliary pathologies as well as appendicitis. Its usefulness in diagnosing diverticulitis is limited. It has no role in screening for colon cancer.  \n\n【14】Answer C is incorrect . CT of the abdomen with infusion is useful in the diagnosis of acute diverticulitis. It may show the presence of diverticula and signs of adjacent inflammatory changes such as edema and fat stranding. Once the patient’s symptoms resolve, there is no need for a follow-up CT scan. This imaging modality has no role in screening for colon cancer.  \n\n【15】Answer D is incorrect . MRI of the abdomen is not useful in the diagnosis or management of diverticulitis. It has no role in screening for colon cancer.  \n\n【16】Answer E is incorrect . An upright abdominal x-ray is cheap and easily obtained. However, it is not used to diagnose diverticulitis nor is it used to rule out colon cancer.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 14:08:32", "endTime": "2024/09/12 14:12:10", "cost": 218.33}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:31", "update_time": "2024-09-11 22:12:11", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 22:08:32"}

This man has suffered a MI. He demonstrates two of the five important risk factors for developing heart disease, which include hypertension, hyperlipidemia, tobacco use, diabetes, and a family history of heart disease. The changes that occur in the affected cardiac tissue can be helpful in assessing when the infarct occurred. During the first day after an MI, the affected tissue begins to undergo coagulative necrosis and releases enzymes such as troponin I and CK-MB from the dying cells. Coagulative necrosis is marked in the early stages by preservation of general tissue architecture, with myocytes becoming increasingly eosinophilic. Contraction bands will also be seen, causing myocytes to take on a wavy appearance.  \n\n【7】Answer B is incorrect . The presence of granulation tissue indicates that remodeling of damaged tissue is occurring. It is characterized by the presence of fibroblasts and vascular proliferation. This would first be seen, along with a mixed inflammatory picture, beginning 5-10 days after a MI.  \n\n【8】Answer C is incorrect . Macrophages are seen in the development of chronic inflammation. Five to ten days after an MI, macrophages come to the scene to aid in cleaning up areas of dead tissue. It is important to remember that it usually takes time for macrophages and other signs of chronic inflammation to appear in any setting.  \n\n【9】Answer D is incorrect . Neutrophils are the hallmark of an acute inflammatory process. A massive influx of neutrophils, along with extensive coagulative necrosis, begins at 12-24 hours and continues until about four days after an MI. Although neutrophils are generally considered the first responders in any inflammatory process, they appear after the start of coagulative necrosis in the evolution of an MI.  \n\n【10】Answer E is incorrect .

Infective endocarditis generally  删除换行 follows a dental or surgical procedure with a pre-existing valvular disease or a  删除换行 septal defect. Acute myocarditis is characterized by myocardial dysfunction  删除换行 and clinical signs of heart failure. Our patient presented with chest pain, had  删除换行 an audible pericardial rub and the ECG showed elevation of the S-T segment. \n\n【19】Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is acute pericarditis. \n\n【20】The chest pain of acute pericarditis is sharp in character and central in  删除换行 location. Therefore, it resembles the chest pain of myocardial infarction, but lacks  删除换行 the characteristic radiation and accompaniments of ischemic chest pain. The  删除换行 pain increases on deep breathing and coughing and therefore, patients prefer  删除换行 shallow respiration. The pain also worsens on lying supine and hence, the patient  删除换行 prefers to sit and lean forward. \n\n【21】The pericardial friction rub is a high-pitched, scratchy or squeaky sound,  删除换行 audible over the precordium along the lower left sternal border. It is better audible  删除换行 during inspiration, with the patient sitting up and leaning forward. Occasionally,  删除换行 the rub is accompanied by a palpable thrill, especially in patients with uremic  删除换行 pericarditis. The classical pericardial rub is triphasic and has three components,  删除换行 each related to a discrete phase of the cardiac cycle. Accordingly, there is a  删除换行 presystolic rub during atrial systole and a systolic and diastolic component  删除换行 related to ventricular systole and diastole respectively. Sometimes, the rub is a  删除换行 one-component or two-component sound, if there is associated atrial fibrillation  删除换行 or ventricular dysfunction. Sometimes the rub is evanescent and changes its  删除换行 quality on a day-to-day basis. \n\n【22】The most common and significant cause of S-T segment elevation on the ECG \n\n【23】is coronary artery disease. S-T elevation occurs in acute myocardial infarction  删除换行 and in coronary vasospasm (Prinzmetal’s angina). In patients with prior  删除换行 myocardial infarction, reasons for S-T segment elevation are Dressler’s syndrome  删除换行 and ventricular aneurysm. S-T elevation also occurs in the early repolarization  删除换行 variant in which case the clinical profile is entirely normal .

Troponin may be elevated in upto 50% of patients with acute  删除换行 pericarditis, thus limiting its diagnostic value. The total leucocyte count (TLC) and \n\n【37】C-reactive protein (CRP) level may be elevated in acute pericarditis. A four-fold  删除换行 rise in antiviral antibody titre may occur, but is not diagnostic and often futile in the  删除换行 absence of specific antiviral therapy. Anti-streptolysin O (ASLO) titre and throat  删除换行 swab culture for beta-hemolytic Streptococcus are appropriate, if rheumatic fever  删除换行 is suspected. Suitable blood cultures are obtained, if the possibility of infective  删除换行 endocarditis is being entertained. In acute pericarditis, ECHO is useful to identify  删除换行 pericardial effusion and features suggestive of associated myocarditis. Usually,  删除换行 only a small rim of effusion is present and the left ventricular systolic function  删除换行 is normal. In myo-pericarditis, the ventricular function is mildly impaired but is  删除换行 generally reversible.\n\n【38】MANAGEMENT ISSUES \n\n【39】Treatment of acute pericarditis should first be targeted against a specific cause, if  删除换行 there is one. Examples include withdrawal of the offending drug in drug-induced  删除换行 pericarditis, hemadialysis for uremic pericarditis, thyroid hormone replacement  删除换行 for myxedema and suitable chemotherapy in malignant disease . \n\n【40】In most cases, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are first-line  删除换行 treatment, in the absence of a specific cause. In post-infarction Dressler’s  删除换行 syndrome, aspirin is preferable over other NSAIDs. It is given in high-doses to  删除换行 begin with, to be tapered down over a period of time. Concomitant use of a proton  删除换行 pump inhibitor is recommended to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. 112 Section 7 Pericardial Infections\n\n【41】Colchicine may be used along with a NSAID in refractory and recurrent cases  删除换行 or alone if NSAIDs are contraindicated.

She had tried numerous over-the-counter treatments, including topical clotrimazole and selenium sulfide shampoo without improvement .\n删除3：<u>Figure 18.1\n\n【13】Non-scaly hypopigmented macules and patches on the back of a woman\n</u>删除3：<u>Figure 18.2\n\n【14】Non-scaly hypopigmented macules and patches on the left flank and back of a woman\n</u>\nPhysical Examination\n--------------------\n\n【15】On examination, multiple ill-defined, non-scaly hypopigmented macules were seen on the back, flanks, and chest. Lesions coalesced into patches over the midline back. Wood’s lamp examination revealed red perifollicular fluorescence. Skin scrapings on potassium hydroxide (KOH) microscopic examination did not show evidence of spores or hyphae.\n\n【16】Clinical Differential Diagnosis\n-------------------------------\n\n【17】The hypopigmentation was felt to be most consistent with progressive macular hypomelanosis (PMH). This disorder is often mistaken for other common conditions seen in darkly pigmented patients, e.g. tinea versicolor, pityriasis alba, vitiligo, and post-inflammatory hypopigmentation. PMH can be distinguished from tinea versicolor and pityriasis alba by its non-pruritic nature and failure to respond to anti-fungal or anti-inflammatory therapy, respectively. In addition, tinea versicolor can often be confirmed by microscopic examination with KOH that will show evidence of fungus. Vitiligo appears depigmented and will illuminate under Wood’s lamp examination. Patients with post-inflammatory hypopigmentation will give a history of a primary skin eruption and a shorter clinical course. Infectious processes and cutaneous lymphoma should be considered in select populations. Rarer infectious etiologies of hypopigmentation should be especially considered if the patient is from an endemic area of leprosy, leishmaniasis, and/or pinta. If asymmetric, atrophic hypopigmented macules and patches with fine scales on the trunk, chest, and sun-protected areas are seen, one should consider the diagnosis of hypopigmented mycosis fungoides 删除10：<u>(Relyveld et al. 2007 ; Elmariah and Kundu 2011 )</u>.\n\n【18】Histopathology\n--------------\n\n【19】Two biopsies were performed from lesional and non-lesional skin on a follow up visit due to minimal response to initial treatment. The biopsy results were non-diagnostic which is often the case in PMH. Skin biopsy of the affected area revealed a normal number of melanocytes with reduced content of epidermal melanin when compared to unaffected skin. The dermis appeared normal. PAS stain was negative for fungal organisms.\n\n【20】Diagnosis\n---------\n\n【21】Progressive macular hypomelanosis (PMH)\n\n【22】Case Treatment\n--------------\n\n【23】The nature of the diagnosis, disease course, and treatment expectations were discussed. The patient was prescribed benzoyl peroxide 5 % wash twice daily with clindamycin lotion 1 % twice daily. The patient had minimal response to this treatment and agreed to a biopsy as above. After exclusion of other entities, treatment was further optimized with narrow-band ultraviolet B (NBUVB) three times weekly in adjunct to topical antimicrobials.\n\n【24】Discussion\n----------\n\n【25】Progressive macular hypomelanosis is a common yet under-diagnosed skin disorder. Authors worldwide have used several names to describe this entity including cutis trunci variata, dyschromia creole, progressive and confluent hypomelanosis of the melanodermic metis, nummular and confluent hypomelanosis, progressive macular confluent hypomelanosis, and idiopathic multiple large macule hypomelanosis 删除10：<u>(Elmariah and Kundu 2011 ; Westerhof et al. 2004 )</u>. Although there are recent reports of PMH in individuals of lighter skin types, this condition continues to be more prevalent in patients with more richly pigmented skin 删除10：<u>(Relyveld et al. 2007 ; Westerhof et al. 2004 )</u>. PMH is characterized by multiple ill-defined round to oval, non-scaly hypopigmented macules and patches that occur on the trunk and that occasionally extend to the neck, face, and proximal extremities. Lesions are asymptomatic with no prior history of inflammation. PMH typically affects young adults, with a female predominance. The clinical course is variable, usually starting in adolescence. It may resolve spontaneously, within 2–5 years, or slowly progress over time 删除10：<u>(Relyveld et al. 2007 ; Elmariah and Kundu 2011 )</u>.\n\n【26】The pathogenesis of PMH is not fully understood. Recently, Westholf et al. proposed a novel hypothesis based on the finding of red fluorescence under Wood’s light examination in affected skin as opposed to normal skin which showed no fluorescence. Authors have attributed this red follicular fluorescence to porphyrin production. In the original studies, cultures from lesional skin but not from unaffected skin isolated Propionibacterium acnes ( P. acnes ), leading to the thought that P. acnes produces a depigmenting agent that interferes with melanin production, resulting in the hypopigmented macules observed clinically. Additional investigation, performed by the same group of investigators in 2010, demonstrated that the Propionibacterium bacteria found in PMH may be a different species than that found in acne patients 删除10：<u>(Relyveld et al. 2007 ; Westerhof et al. 2004 ; Relyveld et al. 2010 )</u>. This is supported by observations that patients with acne are not at increased risk for the development of PMH and vice versa.\n\n【27】The diagnosis of PMH is made based on history, clinical features, red follicular fluorescence under Wood’s lamp examination, and seldom a skin biopsy. Histology examination of PMH is non-diagnostic, and when performed, skin biopsies should be obtained from both lesional and normal skin. A blinded study conducted in a Chinese population confirmed no overall difference in number of S-100 + melanocytes. Using electron microscopy, it was observed that lesional skin had a higher ratio of immature melanosomes (stage II and III-light) in contrast with normal skin. This supports the impression that hypopigmention seen in PMH may be due to impaired melanosome maturation 删除10：<u>(Relyveld et al. 2007 ; Wu et al. 2010 ; Kumarasinghe et al. 2006 )</u>.\n\n【28】Treatment\n---------\n\n【29】The treatment of PMH is challenging and oftentimes delayed, which can be particularly disappointing in those with skin of color in which dyschromia is significantly more evident. There is no first line or single effective treatment for PMH. Given the presumptive bacterial etiology, antimicrobial therapy is the cornerstone of therapy, with many reported cases of successful treatment with oral and topical antimicrobials. Cultures obtained from species show sensitivity to several antibiotics and resistance to metronidazole 删除10：<u>(Westerhof et al. 2004 )</u>. A randomized study of 45 patients showed that benzoyl peroxide 5 % hydrogel/clindamycin 1 % lotion in combination with UVA irradiation led to better repigmentation than fluticasone 0.05 % cream in combination with UVA 删除10：<u>(Relyveld et al. 2006 )</u>. Another study aimed to compare the effectiveness of narrow-band ultraviolet B (NBUVB) monotherapy with NBUVB combined with antimicrobial therapy. A randomized left-right comparison study was conducted and found that significant repigmentation was observed in all 10 subjects over an 8 week treatment trial, with no significant difference between treated sides at all evaluation time points 删除10：<u>(Sim et al. 2011 )</u>.\n\n【30】Wu et al. performed a small retrospective analysis of 6 patients with PMH who were treated with an average of 27 sessions of narrow-band ultraviolet B and reported improvement of hypopigmentation in 6 weeks. Unfortunately, improvement was transient with recurrence noticed as soon as 4 weeks 删除10：<u>(Wu et al. 2010 )</u>. NBUVB appears to be a safe treatment option. The alleged mechanism of action is stimulation of melanogenesis along with the antimicrobial effects of UVB phototherapy 删除10：<u>(Sim et al. 2011 )</u>.\n\n【31】A treatment algorithm was proposed by Elmariah and Kundu, where oral tetracycline, doxycycline, or minocycline with topical benzoyl peroxide and/or clindamycin are used for a minimum of 6 weeks. If no clinical improvement is observed, the authors recommend discontinuing oral antibiotics, and starting NBUVB phototherapy for a minimum of 25–30 treatment sessions in adjunct to topical antimicrobials. In cases of non-response to above-mentioned therapies, a short course of PUVA may be considered. Other less reported treatments can also be considered. One author reported incidental improvement in PMH when oral isotretinoin at 10 mg daily was given for rosacea 删除10：<u>(Kim et al. 2012 )</u>. In addition, in theory, alternative therapies like blue light as is used for acne may be a possible treatment option, but more research is needed.\n\n【32】Key Points\n\n【33】   Progressive macular hypomelanosis (PMH) is a relatively common yet under-recognized and misdiagnosed disorder.\n\n【34】   It is often misdiagnosed as tinea versicolor, pityriasis alba, post-inflammatory hypopigmentation, and/or vitiligo.\n\n【35】   Patients with skin of color are preferentially affected by this not infrequent pigmentary disorder, and the condition is particularly more noticeable in darker skin types.\n\n【36】   Early recognition and counseling is important to avoid unnecessary treatments and provide patients the necessary information in regards to their skin disorder.\n\n【37】   Pathogenesis appears to be related to a putative species of Propionibacterium .\n\n【38】   Proper treatment includes the use of antibacterial agents and phototherapy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 14:10:26", "endTime": "2024/09/12 14:10:51", "cost": 24.816}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:31", "update_time": "2024-09-11 22:10:51", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 22:10:26"}

MHC class I molecules bind peptides derived from pro-teins synthesized in the cytoplasm， and carry them to the cell surface， where they form a complex of peptide and MHC molecule on the cell surface. This complex can then be recognized by antigen-specific CD8+T cells. T cells as a class recognize only peptides presented to them as a complex with an MHC molecule； the T-cell receptors of CD8+T cells recognize only peptides presented by MHC class I mol-ecules， whereas those of CD4\\T cells recognize only peptides presented by MHC class II molecules .\n\n【3】MHC class I molecules are involved principally in immune reactions against virus infections.

They release the pore-forming protein perforin and cytotoxic granzymes， as well as the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor a(TNF-a) and interferon-y (IFN-y).

It is a heterodimeric glycoprotein， composed of one transmembrane a chain bound noncovalently to Bz-microglobulin. The a chain is folded into three protein domains， two of which form a cleft into which the peptide antigen binds.</u>\n\n【6】In humans， the class I and class II MHC molecules are known as the human leuko cyte antigens (HLA)， and together they determine the tissue type of an individual. Each individual expresses three principal types of class I molecule-HLA-A，HLA-B， and HLA-C. These are heterodimeric glycoproteins， composed of an a chain and a B chain， the latter known also as Bz-microglobulin .\n\n【7】The genes encoding the a chains of the human MHC class I molecules are located close together in the MHC on the short arm of chromosome 6 . In humans， the gene encoding Bz-microglobulin， the polypeptide chain common to all class I molecules， is located not in the MHC but on the long arm of chromo-some 15. The genes encoding the a chains are highly polymorphic， and so there are numerous variants of HLA-A， HLA-B，and HLA-C within the population.\n\n【8】Viral proteins， like cellular proteins， are made in the cytoplasm of the infected cell， and some are soon degraded into peptide fragments by large enzyme complexes called proteasomes. The peptides are then transported from the cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum by a complex of two transporter proteins， called TAP1 and TAP2， that is located in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane . The genes encoding TAP1 and TAP2 are also located in the MHC， in the region contain-ing the class II genes .\n\n【9】The endoplasmic reticulum contains MHC class I molecules， which enter as sepa-rate a and B chains as soon as they have been synthesized and are retained there. After the antigenic peptides enter the endoplasmic reticulum they are loaded onto the complex of a chains and Bz-microglobulin. The TAP-binding protein (also known as TAPBP or tapasin) facilitates the interaction of MHC class I molecules with TAP1 and TAP2， and promotes loading of antigenic peptides into this com-plex. The peptide：MHC class I complex is then released and transported onward to the cell surface . In humans， the TAPBP gene is also located within the MHC cluster on the short arm of chromosome 6.\n\n【10】This case describes a rare inherited immune deficiency accompanied by the absence ofMHC class I molecules on the patients' cells.\n删除3：<u>Fig. 12.3 The organization of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on chromosome 6 in humans.

She had severe bronchiectasis (dilatation of the bronchi from repeated infections) and a persistent cough that produced yellow-green sputum. Tatiana had been chroni- cally ill from the age of 4 years， when she started to get repeated infections of the sinuses，middle ears， and lungs， apparently due to a variety of respiratory viruses. The bacteria Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae could be cul- tured from her sputum， and she had been prescribed frequent antibiotic treatment to control her persistent fevers and cough. Her brother Alexander， aged 7 years，also suffered from chronic respiratory infections. Like his sister， he had begun to suffer from severe repeated viral infections of the upper and lower respiratory tracts at an early age. He also had severe bronchiectasis， and H. influenzae could be cultured from his sputum.\n\n【14】Owing to the chronic illness of Tatiana and Alexander， the Islayevs had emigrated recently from Russia to the United States， where they hoped to get better medi- cal treatment. When they came to America they had three other children， aged 5，10， and 13 years， who were all healthy and showed no increased susceptibility to infection. As infants in Moscow， both Tatiana and Alexander had received routine immunizations with oral poliovirus as well as diphtheria， tetanus， and pertussis\n\n【15】(DTP) vaccinations. They had also been given BCG as newborn babies for protection against tuberculosis， and had tolerated all these immunizations well.\n\n【16】When they were examined， Tatiana and Alexander both had elevated levels of lgG， at more than 1500 mg dl-1 (normal levels 600-1400 mg dl-1). They had white blood cell counts of 7000 and 6600 cells ul-1， respectively. Of these white cells， 25% (1750 and 1650 ul-1， respectively) were lymphocytes. Ten percent of the lymphocytes reacted with an antibody against B cells (anti-CD19) (a normal result) and 4% with an anti-body against natural killer (NK) cells (anti-CD16) (normal). The remainder of the lymphocytes reacted with an anti-T-cell antibody (anti-CD3). More than 90% of the lyinpnotylesre T cells were CD4-positive， and 10% were CD8-positive. This represented a profound deficiency of CD8+ T cells. Blood tests on their siblings and parents showed no defi- ciency of CD8+ T cells. Both Tatiana and Alexander had normal neutrophil function and complement titers.\n\n【17】Furthermore， their cell-mediated immunity also seemed normal when tested by delayed hypersensitivity skin tests to tuberculin and antigen from Candida， a fun- gal component of the normal body flora ； they developed the normal delayed-type hypersensitivity response of a hard， raised， red swelling some 50mm in diameter at the site of intradermal injection of these antigens. Both children were found to have high titers of antibodies against herpesvirus and cytomegalovirus as well as against mumps， chickenpox， and measles viruses. When asked， the parents recalled that the children had been immunized against influenza several times，and antibodies against five different strains of influenza were found. However， the anti-influenza antibodies were present in very low titers. They also had low titers of antibody against Epstein-Barr virus.\n\n【18】When white blood cells from all family members were typed for HLA antigens by a serological typing assay， no MHC class l molecules at all could be found on Tatiana's and Alexander's cells. When their blood cells were examined using the more sensi-tive technique of FACS analysis ， it was found that Tatiana and Alex-ander expressed very small amounts of MHC class I molecules， less than 1% of the amount expressed on the cells of their father . In contrast， they expressed MHC class ll molecules normally.\n\n【19】The HLA typing revealed that the mother and father shared an MHC haplotype(HLA-A3，-B63， HLA-DR4， -DQ3) and that Tatiana and Alexander had inherited this shared haplotype from both their parents . They were therefore homozy-gous for the MHC region. The other children were heterozygous. It was thus con- cluded that the two children’s susceptibility to respiratory infections was linked to the MHC locus， for which only they were homozygous.\n\n【20】To try to determine the underlying defect， B cells from Tatiana and Alexander were established as cell lines in culture by transformation with Epstein-Barr virus. The transformed B cells were examined for the presence of messenger RNA for MHC class I molecules： normal levels were found. This eliminated the possibility that they had a structural or regulatory defect in genes encoding the o chain of the MHC class I molecules. Because the gene for B2-microglobulin maps to chromosome 15， it was highly unlikely that their MHC-linked condition resulted from a defect in that gene. Only one possibility remained to be explored-a mutation in the TAP1， TAP2， or TAPBP genes. When the DNA sequences of these genes were determined，both Tati-ana and Alexander were found to have the same nonsense mutation in their TAP2genes. Their parents were found to be heterozygous for this mutation.\n删除3：<u>Fig. 12.6 Fluorescent antibody typing for HLA antigens.

Despite a profound deficiency in the number of CD8+ T cells and the inability to present viral antigens to CD8+T cells because of the absence of MHC class I antigens， the Islayev children were apparently able to fight some viral infections. The high levels of antibodies against chickenpox， measles， and mumps viruses in their blood showed that they had been exposed to and successfully overcome these infections.\n\n【24】They had sustained innumerable respiratory viral infections， however， and their poor antibody responses to a variety of influenza strains showed that they might have had problems responding to respiratory viruses in general. It might have been that some viruses were better able than others to stimulate an increased expression of MHC class I molecules on their cells. Tatiana and Alexander expressed MHC class I molecules at very low levels， and when their isolated B cells were loaded with an antigenic peptide from influenza virus， this stimulated a small increase in the number of MHC class I molecules on these cells . It is therefore pos-sible that other virus infections that they sustained， such as chickenpox， were able to induce sufficient expression of MHC class I molecules to terminate the infection properly.\n\n【25】The repeated respiratory infections caused anatomic damage to their airways， resulting in the bronchiectasis. The abundant Haemophilus and pneumococci in their sputum is characteristic of patients with bronchiectasis， and in their case was not due directly to any deficiency of immunity against these capsulated bacteria(compare with Case 1). Patients with MHC class I deficiency often suffer from mid-line granulomatous disease， resembling Wegener's granulomatosis. Vasculitis is also common， especially on the extremities.\n\n【26】The profound reduction of CD8+T cells in patients with MHC class I deficiency is a direct consequence of the lack of MHC class I molecules on the surface of epi-thelial and dendritic cells in the thymus， the organ in which all T cells bearing a：B T-cell receptors mature. The interaction of thymocytes with MHC class I molecules expressed by thymic epithelial and dendritic cells is crucial for the intrathymic maturation of CD8+ T cells.\n\n【27】This family reveals that we have much to learn about the role of MHC class I mol-ecules in protection against intracellular pathogens.\n删除3：<u>Fig. 12.8 Increased expression of MHC class I molecules in response to virus infection.

She worked as a schoolteacher and lived at home with her husband and daughters. The first change in behavior her family noticed was she began obsessively purchasing expensive concert tickets and following a particular band touring across the country. Around this time, she also became more withdrawn from her husband and developed outbursts of anger. The following year she developed numerous obsessive behaviors, such as repeatedly locking and unlocking doors. She also began to discuss her bathroom habits with others. She stopped cooking and only ate limited items from fast-food restaurants, which led to a 30-lb weight gain. Two years after symptom onset, she began to make inappropriate sexual comments to others. Her family took away her car after they observed she would become disoriented in familiar places. Three years into her symptoms, she was no longer working due to several incidents of inappropriate behavior at work. Her husband stopped traveling for work so that he could assist her at home due to her engaging in dangerous behaviors such as “playing” with the gas stove.\n\n【3】This is one of those instances in which a rich history is as good as an exam. The family’s observations of her behavior over years provide better insight into her condition and deficits than any brief exam performed in the clinic. I include her examination next, as well as neuropsychological testing, for the sake of completeness. The purpose of the exam is to formally assess which cognitive domains are most affected .\n\n【4】On examination, she was cooperative, but at times she demonstrated inappropriate laughing and smiling that was incongruent to the situation. She had minimal insight into her behaviors. She stood and walked around the clinic room, and she repetitively punched her fists together and scratched her fingernails. She scored 27/30 on the MMSE (recall was 0/3). The rest of her neurologic exam was unremarkable. She subsequently underwent neuropsychological evaluation, which revealed significant deficits in the domain of executive functioning.### What is the pace?\n\n【5】She presents with symptoms that evolved over months to years, which is consistent with a chronic pace of illness.### What is the localization?\n\n【6】What are the salient features of her history and exam, both what impairments are significant and what are lacking? As discussed in Chapter 16 , the components of the mental status that are normal are often just as important at helping localize the lesion as the components that are abnormal.\n\n【7】Her initial symptoms include inappropriate/disinhibited behaviors. She made expensive purchases that were uncharacteristic for her. This progressed to abnormal compulsive behaviors and situationally inappropriate and childlike behavior. Behavioral changes can occur in many different neurologic diseases but most commonly are related to dysfunction of the frontal lobes.\n\n【8】Lesions to the frontal lobes can result in numerous abnormalities, such as motor dysfunction, incontinence, gait abnormality, apathy/akinesia, and personality changes, among other symptoms. Many of these symptoms are poorly localized to one specific area within the frontal lobes, which are likely involved at a high level of regulating many cognitive functions. We commonly refer to this role of the frontal lobe as executive function .\n\n【9】Executive function is what allows us to learn and adapt our behaviors based on our environment and past experiences to accomplish the task at hand. When this is disrupted, a patient frequently loses the ability to accomplish the complex tasks associated with daily life and is no longer able to live independently. Depending on the location of frontal lobe disruption, there might be various cognitive or behavioral changes associated with executive dysfunction.\n\n【10】There are overlapping syndromes of behavioral abnormalities associated with frontal lobe lesions, such as abulia or akinetic mutism versus the hyperactive and compulsive behaviors that our patient exhibited. Instead of being withdrawn from the outside world, she seems unable to navigate it appropriately. She has lost her sense of social cues, and her behaviors seem to be primarily motivated by personal gratification. A discussion about the specific networks within the frontal lobes is beyond the scope of this book. However, this syndrome of disinhibited, socially inappropriate behavior and executive dysfunction most likely localizes to the medial-orbital parts of the frontal lobes.\n\n【11】Although she does have impaired recall on examination, her history, and neurologic impairment, is clearly driven primarily by her change in personality and abnormal behaviors, rather than an amnestic syndrome. In many neurodegenerative processes, the order of onset of symptoms is important. For example, a patient with dementia that precedes the development of parkinsonism might be diagnosed with Lewy body dementia, whereas a patient who initially develops parkinsonism followed years later by cognitive impairment likely has Parkinson’s disease. Individuals with Alzheimer’s disease frequently develop changes in personality and behavior, but those changes typically occur later in the illness secondary to more global cognitive impairment. The fact that her changes in personality and behavior were her initial dominant symptoms out of proportion to other cognitive dysfunction helps us to localize the lesion to a frontal lobe process.### What is the syndromic diagnosis?\n\n【12】She presents with a syndromic diagnosis of chronic onset of frontal lobe dysfunction.### What is the etiologic diagnosis?\n\n【13】Many neurologic disorders might begin with what is initially perceived by the patient, the patient’s family, and healthcare providers as a psychiatric rather than a neurologic illness. This is one of the more common diagnostic errors made by clinicians. This is where pace and localization play a vital role. Often it simply takes time for an illness to “declare itself” and for the diagnosis to become apparent. This requires patience on the part of the clinician and careful explanation to the patient or their family that it might take time (months or even years) to make an accurate diagnosis.\n\n【14】Since her dysfunction is localized to the frontal lobes, it seems less likely that this could be the result of a toxic or metabolic process, which we might expect to cause more global cortical dysfunction. A slow-growing tumor or other mass-occupying lesion (such as a large frontal meningioma or subdural hematoma) could cause her symptoms. However, an MRI of her brain did not show any compressive lesions. Thus, we are left with an etiologic diagnosis of a neurodegenerative/genetic illness. Of those categories, is there one that fits her syndrome?### Conclusion\n\n【15】She was given the diagnosis of probable behavioral-variant frontotemporal lobar degeneration (bvFTLD), which is a collection of pathologic diagnoses that selectively involve the frontal and temporal lobes to varying degrees. Of note, there are other clinical presentations of FTLD due to the predominant location of pathology within the frontal and temporal lobes. Histopathology studies typically show accumulation of either tau or TDP-43 inclusions. However, there are other rarer pathologic variants. I fear making a comment that will be obsolete at the time this case is being read in the future, but at least at present, distinguishing between these various pathologic subtypes of bvFTLD is challenging in the absence of a biopsy or autopsy. Unfortunately, at present, treatment is limited and identification of the specific pathology causing the clinical syndrome is of research rather than clinical use.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 14:19:35", "endTime": "2024/09/12 14:19:52", "cost": 17.324}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:31", "update_time": "2024-09-11 22:19:52", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 22:19:35"}

He was initially diagnosed with pityriasis rosea and reported complete resolution of the eruption. However, a similar rash recurred eight years later. An alternative medicine specialist had prescribed an oral anti-fungal and later topical steroid without resolution.\n\n【11】Physical Examination\n--------------------\n\n【12】Involving approximately 75 % body surface area (BSA), he had well-demarcated hyper- and hypopigmented discrete round and ovoid variably sized patches on the trunk, buttocks, thighs and the intertriginous areas.

Well-demarcated hyper- and hypopigmented discrete round and ovoid variably sized patches are noted on the chest, stomach ( a ), back, buttocks, thighs and the intertriginous areas ( b ). Some of the lesions had fine scale\n</u>\nDifferential Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【14】The patient’s clinical presentation was felt to be consistent with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Pityriasis rosea is a common skin disorder found in children and young adults and manifests as an acute, self-limiting, papulosquamous eruption, usually beginning with a “herald patch.” Tinea versicolor is characterized by hypopigmented or hyperpigmented macules and patches on the chest and the back, typically in young active adults. Patients with inflammatory vitiligo have lesions with an erythematous, raised border, which is present from the onset of vitiligo or may appear several months or years after the initial onset; mild pruritus may be present. Pityriasis lichenoides chronica presents as small erythematous–to–reddish brown papules, with fine scale. Atopic dermatitis with post-inflammatory dyspigmentation is also included in the differential.\n\n【15】Histopathology\n--------------\n\n【16】A punch biopsy showed a moderately dense atypical lymphocytic infiltrate lining up at the dermoepidermal junction with exocytosis of cells and Pautrier microabscesses in the epidermis. Flow cytometry showed cluster of differentiation (CD)3+/CD4+/CD7-/CD8-/CD30- T lymphocytes.\n\n【17】Imaging\n-------\n\n【18】A computed axial tomography scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis revealed 6 mm left lower lobe pulmonary nodule, bilateral axillary, pelvic and inguinal lymphadenopathy. A positron emission tomography (PET) scan showed increased 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake of the skin of the trunk, lower extremities, face and scalp as well as increased uptake of the lymph nodes of the neck, axillary, external iliac and inguinal areas. Right femoral lymph node biopsy revealed no abnormalities. A Sezary preparation of the blood showed no atypical cells.\n\n【19】Diagnosis\n---------\n\n【20】Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, Mycosis Fungoides subtype, Stage IIA (T <sub>2 </sub> , N <sub>1 </sub> , M <sub>0 </sub> , B <sub>0 </sub> )\n\n【21】Case Treatment\n--------------\n\n【22】A discussion of the diagnosis, natural history, and treatment was discussed. Because patients presenting with early stage disease very rarely have systemic involvement, skin-directed therapy is the appropriate choice. He was started on topical nitrogen mustard 0.02 % gel once a day. He was also started on narrow band UVB phototherapy three times a week. At 6 months follow-up, moderate improvement was noted in approximately 75 % of his lesions. He is followed by Dermatology every 6 months.\n\n【23】Treatment for Advanced Stages IIB, III, IV\n------------------------------------------\n\n【24】TSEBT and phototherapy, though primarily having skin-directed mechanisms, can also be used for more advanced stages. Other treatment options include systemic therapy such as oral retinoids, interferons, histone deactylase inhibitors, extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP), antifolates, allogeneic stem cell transplant and a variety of combination therapies.\n\n【25】### Retinoids\n\n【26】Oral retinoids that have undergone or are currently undergoing investigation for treatment of CTCL/ MF include isotretinoin, acitretin and etretinate. Oral bexarotene is the only FDA approved oral retinoid for refractory CTCL at all stages.\n\n【27】### Interferons\n\n【28】IFNα has gained popularity owing to relatively fewer side effects in comparison to IFNβ or IFNγ. In addition, these side effects can easily be ameliorated with dose reduction 删除10：<u>(Olsen and Bunn 1995 )</u> (Olsen). IFNα is given at low doses via subcutaneous injection of 1–3 million units \\[MUs\\] three times weekly with a gradual increase in dose to 9–12 MUs daily as tolerated. Maintenance therapy is continued for at least 3 months and then tapered over 6–12 months 删除10：<u>(Olsen and Bunn 1995 )</u>. It is administered as monotherapy but is even more effective when combined with PUVA therapy for stages IB-IIB 删除10：<u>(Kuzel et al. 1995 )</u>. In skin of color patients with advanced stage disease that is refractory to treatment, combination of IFNα and PUVA is particularly worth trying given the good response to PUVA that is often observed in this population.\n\n【29】### Histone Deactylase Inhibitors\n\n【30】Panobinostat and vorinostat both work by increasing acetylation of protein involved in oncogenic pathways. Vorinostat is FDA approved for advanced disease and given orally at 400 mg daily 删除10：<u>(Duvic et al. 2009 )</u>. Panobinostat is given by mouth at 20 mg three times per week 删除10：<u>(Duvic et al. 2013 )</u>. Both drugs have shown have a benign safety profile at these doses and are relatively effective for refractory MF.\n\n【31】### Antifolates\n\n【32】Methotrexate and pralatrexate are both FDA approved for treatment of refractory and relapsed CTCL. The mechanism of action for both involves inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase. Methotrexate is given at a median weekly dose of 25 mg 删除10：<u>(Zackheim et al. 2003 )</u>, while pralatrexate is administered at a dose of 15 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> weekly 删除10：<u>(Foss et al. 2012 )</u>. The once weekly regimen allows for a manageable regimen and therefore medication adherence.\n\n【33】### Extracorporeal Photopheresis (ECP)\n\n【34】ECP involves separating circulating mononuclear cells by leukapheresis, mixing the cells with 8-methoxypsoralen, exposing the mixture with ultraviolet A light and then reinfusing into the patient. It is approved for palliative treatment of CTCL given on 2 consecutive days every 2–4 weeks over a period of at least 6 months 删除10：<u>(Arulogun et al. 2008 )</u>. It is also effective and recommended for erythrodermic CTCL 删除10：<u>(Edelson et al. 1987 )</u>. Though a viable option with a relatively benign side-effect profile, a single institution study by Agi et al. showed ECP is less likely to be offered as a treatment option to black patients compared to white patients 删除10：<u>(Agi et al. 2015 )</u>.\n\n【35】### Chemotherapy\n\n【36】Chemotherapeutic agents are used as palliative monotherapies in those with refractory or relapsing therapy that no longer responds to initial therapy. Monotherapies used for treatment of MF include gemcitabine and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin 删除10：<u>(Dummer et al. 2012 ; Duvic et al. 2006 )</u>. Multiagent regimens consist of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, VP-16 and prednisolone in various combinations. It is important to be aware that as combination therapy, these agents achieve complete and partial remission in tumor stage MF but do not maintain remission 删除10：<u>(Molin et al. 1980 )</u>.\n\n【37】Key Points\n----------\n\n【38】   Classic mycosis fungoides presents with patches and plaques on non sunexposed areas that may slowly evolve into tumors.\n\n【39】   Early CTCL in skin of color may resemble classic inflammatory dermatoses, such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, vitiligo, or lichen planus, with reactive T cells and other immune cells.\n\n【40】   The early recognition and diagnosis of CTCL in skin of color is facilitated by a correlation of clinical, histological, and cytomorphological findings, and can decrease the morbidity and mortality currently associated with this disease.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 13:52:16", "endTime": "2024/09/12 13:52:49", "cost": 32.494}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:31", "update_time": "2024-09-11 21:52:48", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 21:52:15"}

Recognize potential complications arising from their treatment.\n\n【14】Considerations\n\n【15】This patient is a 61-year-old woman who sustained a fall and a left peripros-thetic femur fracture. Although the patient presented complaining of left hip pain and sustained no other obvious injuries， it is important to rule out con-comitant injuries， including head trauma or other musculoskeletal injuries. A thorough neurovascular examination of the left lower extremity， including sensory， and vascular assessments of the foot and ankle is mandatory. Move-ment of the hip， quadriceps， and hamstring may be limited as a result of pain， but a thorough assessment of the distal musculature should be performed. In addition， key questions regarding the patient’s functional status before the fall may provide valuable insight： Was the patient able to ambulate without assis-tance? Did the patient have any thigh pain before the fall (which may indicate the presence of an already loose femoral component)?\n\n【16】Given the patient's inability to ambulate， she should be admitted to the hospital for definitive management of her fracture. An appropriate medical workup should be performed， including a chest x-ray， electrocardiogram， and laboratory tests before proceeding to the operating room. The medical team performing risk stratification 删除换行 of the surgery should understand that revision surgery will likely require a prolonged operative time and increased blood loss versus a primary， elective total hip aarth1ro0-plasty. The orthopaedic team must preoperatively plan the surgical procedure and ensure that all implants and options that may be used are readily available. Most important， the patient must understand that in revision hip surgery， both the rates of postoperative dislocation and infection are increased compared with primary hip surgery.\n\n【17】APPROACH TO：\n\n【18】Periprosthetic Hip Fracture\n\n【19】DEFINITIONS\n\n【20】PERIPROSTHETIC FRACTURE： A break in the bone surrounding a joint replacement prosthesis.\n\n【21】POROUS COATING： In total hip replacement， cementless implants commonly have a region where the surface is covered in microscopic pores， which enhances bone ingrowth for implant fixation.\n\n【22】SUBSIDENCE： In the setting of a total hip replacement， refers to the femoral stem migrating distally after initial implantation， indicating a high likelihood of a loose stem.\n\n【23】CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【24】Etiologies\n\n【25】As the number of patients in the population living with a total hip arthroplasty continues to rise， the incidence of periprosthetic fractures also continues to increase. Patients with total hip replacements span a wide age range， with elderly patients being at increased risk for low energy falls， whereas younger， more active patients may be at risk for higher energy trauma. The Mayo Clinic Joint Replacement Data-base reported the largest series of periprosthetic hip fractures and noted an inci-dence of 1% (238 of 23，980) in primary hip arthroplasties and 4% (252 of 6349) in revision hip arthroplasties， although the overall incidence has been reported to be as high as 18%. Periprosthetic hip fractures can occur both intraoperatively and postoperatively， and it is key to accurately classify these fractures to determine the appropriate treatment plan. The most critical consideration is to determine the sta-bility of the implant， as simple fixation of a fracture surrounding a loose femoral stem is likely to fail as a result of implant subsidence.\n\n【26】Risk factors for periprosthetic hip fractures are similar to those of the general population. In the elderly， low-energy falls， particularly in the setting of osteoporosis or inflammatory arthropathy， can lead to periprosthetic fractures. Another consid-eration pertains to the type of femoral component fixation and the use of either a proximally or fully-porous coated implant. Currently， the majority of femoral 删除换行 stems in primary total hip arthroplasty are implanted using cementless fixation， in which the femoral stem has a proximal porous coating， allowing bony ingrowth and fixation at the proximal aspect of the stem. This enables the stress from weightbear-ing to be transferred from the femoral head， through the proximal bone and calcar of the femur， and then distally through the native femoral shaft. With these wedge-fit tapered designs， proximal fractures may occur. With cylindrical fully-porous coated stems， distal“split”fractures can occur.\n\n【27】Clinical Presentation\n\n【28】Patients typically present with a low-energy mechanism of injury， such as a fall from standing， and have pain in the hip and femur， with or without the ability to ambulate. It is key to determine any other sites of injury， including head trauma， and whether or not the patient had any shortness of breath， lightheadedness， dizziness， or symptoms indicating a cardiac or neurologic cause of their injury. Any symptoms in the lower extremity before the injury should also be noted， along with signs of start-up thigh pain (pain initiated with ambulation on rising from a chair) that may indicate a loose femoral stem.\n\n【29】Prior surgical records and reports should be obtained to determine the prior surgical approach， implant type and size， and any perioperative complications including infection. The presence of prior infection should raise concerns of an active infection， and further testing should be performed to rule out infection such as hip aspiration， or cultures obtained intraoperatively. Of note， normal labora-tory markers for occult infection such as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein can be falsely positive in the setting of a fracture and thus are of limited utility. As always， a thorough medical history should be obtained. A detailed examination of the affected lower extremity， including a complete neuro-vascular examination， and assessment of prior incisions and skin integrity should be performed. In addition， any leg length discrepancy should also be noted to assist with preoperative planning.\n\n【30】Diagnosis\n\n【31】The diagnosis of a periprosthetic hip fracture can typically be made using standard radiographs. Radiographs should include an AP of the pelvis， AP and lateral of the hip， and AP and lateral of the femur. Visualization of the entire femur is critical to assess the presence and distal extent of the fracture. To determine the stability of the implant， comparison to prior radiographs is useful to assess any increase in peripros-thetic bone loss or implant subsidence that may suggest component loosening. With cementless femoral implants， the point at which the metal stem narrows proximally to become the femoral neck is typically aligned with the proximal， medial aspect of the native femur. If this point on the femoral stem migrates distally (or a fracture causes the medial aspect of the native femur to migrate proximally or displace)， then the femoral stem is loose and needs to be revised. It is critical to assess both the acetabular and femoral components for both position and signs of loosening， as signs of acetabular loosening may warrant revision of the acetabular component during concomitant fixation of the femur fracture. Ultrasound， computed tomography， and magnetic resonance imaging are not routinely required.\n\n【32】The treatment of a periprosthetic hip fracture is guided by the Vancouver classifica-tion system . Type A fractures include fractures of the greater trochan-ter (A) and lesser trochanter (A ). Greater trochanter fractures are stable when minimally displaced， but may require surgical treatment with a plate if displaced proximally. Lesser trochanter fractures can often be treated nonoperatively. How-ever， if a significant portion of the calcar is involved， leading to destabilization of the stem， then revision of the femoral stem with fixation of the calcar/lesser trochanter with cables or supplementary plate fixation surrounding the greater trochanter is required.\n\n【33】Type B fractures occur around or just below the tip of the femoral stem. A B1fracture occurs around a well-fixed stem and can be treated with plates and screws and possibly cortical strut allografts and cables. A B2 fracture occurs around or just below an unstable stem， and thus revision of the femoral stem is required. Typically， long porous-coated cementless stems are used to bypass the fracture and to achieve distal fixation. In addition， the fracture fragment is fixed using plates， cables， or cor-tical strut allografts. A B3 fracture is distinguished from a B2 fracture， as B3 fractures possess insufficient bone stock. Therefore， B3 fractures are also treated with femoral component revision and fracture fixation， but often require special techniques such as bone grafting or implantation of a proximal femoral replacement.\n\n【34】Type C fractures occur well below the femoral prosthesis and thus are treated with fixation of the fracture itself， without revision of the femoral or acetabular components.\n\n| Table 6-1· THE VANCOUVER CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM OF PERIPROSTHETIC FEMUR FRACTURES  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| vancouverClassifica- tion Type  | Description  | Treatment  |\n| A  | Lesser trochanter fracture  | Nonoperative if minimally displaced andfemoral stem stable； revision of femoral stem and fixation of fractu re if stem is loose  |\n| A。  | Greater trochanter fracture  | Nonoperative if minimally displaced； fixation offracture with cables or hook plate if dis placed  |\n| B1  | Fracture around or just below awell-fixed stem  | Fixation of fracture with plates， screws， cables，and/or cortical strut allograft  |\n| B2  | Fracture around or just belowan unstable stem  | Revision of the femoral stem with fixation of thetracture  |\n| B3  | Fracture around or just belowan unstable stem with poor remaining bone stock  | Revision of the femoral stem with fixation ofthe fracture (often requires supplemental bonegrafting or revision with proximal femoralreplacement)  |\n| C  | Fracture well distal to the tip ofthe stem， which does not affectthe stability of the implant  | Fixation of the fracture， without revision of thefemoral stem  |\n\n【36】Complications\n\n【37】Complications after the treatment of periprosthetic hip fractures include failure of the fracture to heal appropriately (nonunion)， failure of femoral stem fixation(commonly owing to misdiagnosis of the initial stability of the stem)， infection， dislocation， thromboembolic complications， and medical morbidity and mortality related to the surgical treatment itself.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 13:59:58", "endTime": "2024/09/12 14:00:34", "cost": 35.789}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:31", "update_time": "2024-09-11 22:00:34", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 21:59:58"}

This is a critical transporter for reabsorption of NaCl from the thick ascending limb into the medullary interstitium. This transport of NaCl is the driving force behind the establishment of the hypertonicity of the medullary interstitium that is essential for the reabsorption of water from the collecting ducts and the generation of a concentrated urine. Inhibition of the thick ascending limb cotrans-porter will lead to both a greater load of NaCl left behind in the tubu-lar fluid， increasing urinary NaCl levels， and a reduced hypertonicity of the medullary interstitium (less NaCl)， decreasing the gradient for water reabsorption from the collecting ducts. This leads to a rapid and sustained increase in urinary volume flow along with significant uri-nary levels of NaCl. Hence， furosemide is a potent diuretic.\n\n【19】\\[23.21 D. Loop diuretics such as Lasix (furosemide) potently inhibit the Na+-K+-Cl-cotransporter in the thick ascending limb. NaCl reab-sorption in the thick ascending limb through this cotransporter is the driving force behind the operation of the countercurrent multiplier and the ability to excrete a concentrated urine (and a diluted urine). Inhibition of this cotransporter leads to a much greater load of Nat being delivered to the distal tubule and collecting ducts. With the increased delivery of Nat and fluid to the late distal tubule and corti-cal collecting ducts， K+ secretion by the late distal tubule and cortical collecting ducts will be enhanced， leading to hypokalemia.\n\n【20】\\[23.3\\] B. Aldosterone-secreting tumors may lead to hypertension， usually causing elevated serum sodium levels and low potassium levels(because of urinary reabsorption of sodium and excretion of potas-sium). One of the basic tests in the workup of newly diagnosed hyper-tension is serum electrolytes to assess for this disorder.\n\n【21】PHYSIOLOGY PEARLS\n\n【22】Reabsorption of NaCl by the thick ascending limb underlies the gen-eration of a medullary interstitial hypertonicity necessary for the passive reabsorption of water from the medullary collecting ducts.\n\n【23】Loop diuretics are potent diuretics that inhibit the Na+-K+-C1-cotransporter at the luminal membrane of the thick ascending limb， thereby inhibiting NaCl reabsorption by this segment and water reabsorption by the medullary collecting ducts.

He provided a his-tory of fatigue， muscle aches， decreased appetite， mild nausea， and weight loss of around 5-6 pounds over several months. He was hospitalized locally when his blood pressure was found to be low and his electrolytes were abnormal with a serum sodium concentration of 124 mEq/L and serum potassium concentrations that were above normal limits (i.e.，>5.2 mEq/L).

TType I familial hyperlipidemia is caused by lipoprotein lipase deficiency and results in abdominal pain，xanthomas， and hepatosplenomegaly. ●TType III is caused by a defect in apolipoprotein E2 synthesis and results in palmar xanthomas and tubo-eruptive xanthomas. Type lV is caused by increased very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) production and decreased elimination.  |\n| What is the genetic pattern of this condition? FH is inherited in an autosomal manner. Heterozygotes typically have high cholesterol， approximatelyOZ370 mg/dL， and are at increased risk of myocardial infarctions. Homozygotes frequently have extremelyhigh cholesterol levels， up to 1000 mg/dL， and frequently die before 30 years of age from cardiovasculardisease. Normal total cholesterol is < 200 mg/dL， and levels >240 mg/dL are considered elevated.  |\n| What is the molecular basis of this condition? In FH there is a mutation in the LDL receptor gene. This results in a smaller number of functional LDLreceptors. Normally， LDL circulates in the blood and binds to its receptor on hepatocyte membranes andis then taken up into the liver and metabolized. In FH patients， LDL is taken up by the hepatocytes lessefficiently， leading to elevated LDL levels in the blood.  |\n| What would the microscopic examination of the lesions on this patient's arms show?Cholesterol deposits in the skin， called xanthomas， form when there is a persistently elevated LDL level.They are composed largely of lipid-laden macrophages.  |\n\n【3】Statins inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl Acetyl-CoA 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA\n\n【4】coenzyme A reductase， a hepatic enzyme 删除换行 that catalyzes the rate-determining step\n\n【5】Thiolase HMG-CoAreductase 删除换行 in cholesterol synthesis.

He also had small， raised yellow-brown lesions on the extensor surfaces of his arms. FIGURE 2-3. Severe atherosclerosis of the aorta. (Courtesy of the Centers for Disease Con-trol and Prevention Public Health Image Library.http：//phil.cdc.gov.)  |\n| --- |\n| What is the most likely diagnosis? ·This patient had familial hypercholesterolemia (FH)， an inherited disorder characterized by extremelyhigh serum cholesterol levels. TType I familial hyperlipidemia is caused by lipoprotein lipase deficiency and results in abdominal pain，xanthomas， and hepatosplenomegaly. ●TType III is caused by a defect in apolipoprotein E2 synthesis and results in palmar xanthomas and tubo-eruptive xanthomas. Type lV is caused by increased very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) production and decreased elimination.  |\n| What is the genetic pattern of this condition? FH is inherited in an autosomal manner. Heterozygotes typically have high cholesterol， approximatelyOZ370 mg/dL， and are at increased risk of myocardial infarctions. Homozygotes frequently have extremelyhigh cholesterol levels， up to 1000 mg/dL， and frequently die before 30 years of age from cardiovasculardisease. Normal total cholesterol is < 200 mg/dL， and levels >240 mg/dL are considered elevated.  |\n| What is the molecular basis of this condition? In FH there is a mutation in the LDL receptor gene. This results in a smaller number of functional LDLreceptors. Normally， LDL circulates in the blood and binds to its receptor on hepatocyte membranes andis then taken up into the liver and metabolized. In FH patients， LDL is taken up by the hepatocytes lessefficiently， leading to elevated LDL levels in the blood.  |\n| What would the microscopic examination of the lesions on this patient's arms show?Cholesterol deposits in the skin， called xanthomas， form when there is a persistently elevated LDL level.They are composed largely of lipid-laden macrophages.  |\n\n【3】Statins inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl Acetyl-CoA 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA\n\n【4】coenzyme A reductase， a hepatic enzyme 删除换行 that catalyzes the rate-determining step\n\n【5】Thiolase HMG-CoAreductase 删除换行 in cholesterol synthesis.

She denies any trauma or inciting incident but reports that she noticed the numbness and tingling after waking up one morning. The symptoms come and go throughout the day and are worse in the night time， waking her up 3 to 4 times a week. Over the past month，her symptoms have gotten progressively worse， with some days of constant numbness. She denies any symptoms in her neck， shoulder， or arm. She denies any pain. She reports feeling weaker in her right hand， especially with opening a bottle or buttoning her shirt. Over the last few months， her right hand has fatigued faster than her left.\n\n【1】On physical exam， she has full active range of motion of her neck， right shoul-der， elbow， wrist， and fingers. Focused exam of her right upper extremity reveals no gross deformity or muscle atrophy. She has ulnar deviation of her small ringer. There is no erythema， ecchymosis， or effusions. She localizes her numbness to her ring and small fingers and cannot discern whether the symptoms are dorsal or volar. On strength testing， she has 5/5 strength of her biceps， triceps， wrist extensors/flexors， thumb extensors/flexors， and flexors of her index and middle finger. She has 3/5 strength of her hand intrinsics and the flexors of her ring and small finger. She has normal sensation to light touch but decreased sensation to pinprick over the volar and dorsal ulnar aspect of her hand. She has a 2+ radial pulse and normal Allen test. Elbow， wrist， and hand radiographs are negative for any pathology.\n\n【2】What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【3】What muscles does this disease process affect?\n\n【4】What is your next diagnostic step?\n\n【5】What are the treatment options?\n\n【6】Summary： A 45-year-old right-hand dominant woman presents with 6 months of right hand numbness， tingling， and now weakness. She denies any history of trauma or specific inciting event and states that her symptoms have worsened over the last month. On exam there is no gross deformity or muscle atrophy of her right upper extremity， but weakness of her intrinsics and ring and small finger flexors is observed. She also has decreased sensation to pinprick over the volar and dorsal ulnar aspect of her hand.\n\n【7】Most likely diagnosis： Cubital tunnel syndrome.\n\n【8】Affected muscles： Flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU)， hand intrinsics (lumbricals for ring and small finger， dorsal interossei， palmar interossei)， hypothenar muscles(palmaris brevis， abductor digiti minimi， opponens digiti minimi， flexor digiti minimi)， flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) for ring and small finger， adductor pollicis， deep head of flexor pollicis brevis.\n\n【9】Next diagnostic step： Electrodiagnostic testing.\n\n【10】Treatment options： Nonsurgical options include bracing， activity modifications， and physical therapy， whereas surgery involves ulnar nerve decompression at the cubital tunnel.\n\n【11】Objectives\n\n【12】1\\. Understand the anatomy of the ulnar nerve and the potential sites of compression.\n\n【13】2\\. Understand the physical exam findings and electromyelogram (EMG) analysis associated with ulnar nerve entrapment.\n\n【14】3\\. Know the treatment options for cubital tunnel syndrome.\n\n【15】Considerations\n\n【16】This 45-year-old woman presents complaining of symptoms concerning for an entrapment neuropathy. The first priority is to perform a thorough history， which will help in narrowing down the possible diagnoses. This patient denies any trauma or inciting event， and her symptoms (right hand numbness， tingling， and weak-ness)， which have become more constant over the last month， typically wax and wane throughout the day and are most severe at night. Given this history， the prac-titioner must consider the entrapment neuropathies of the upper extremity in the differential diagnosis. This includes carpal tunnel and cubital tunnel syndromes. A focused physical exam of the right upper extremity will further aid the clinician in determining the diagnosis. This includes ruling out cervical spine pathology that can cause similar symptoms， as well as a brachial plexopathy. In this specific case， for which ulnar nerve entrapment is likely， plain radiographs should be obtained and 删除换行 electrodiagnostic testing performed. Treatment options can then be discussed pend-ing confirmation of the diagnosis of cubital tunnel syndrome.\n\n【17】DEFINITIONS\n\n【18】TINEL TEST： A way to detect irritated nerves. It is performed by lightly tapping or percussing over a given nerve to elicit a sensation of\"tingling”or“pins and needles”in the distribution of the nerve.\n\n【19】FROMENT SIGN： A test for ulnar nerve palsy that specifically assesses the action of the adductor pollicis (ulnar nerve innervated). The patient is asked to hold a piece of paper between the thumb and index finger. Normally， as the examiner attempts to pull the paper away， an individual will be able to maintain a hold on the paper with little or no difficulty. However， the patient with ulnar nerve palsy will flex the thumb via the flexor pollicis longus (innervated by the anterior interosseous branch of the median nerve) to try to maintain a hold on the paper.\n\n【20】WARTENBERG SIGN： A sign noting the position of abduction and extension assumed by the small finger in the setting of cubital tunnel syndrome.\n\n【21】CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【22】Anatomy\n\n【23】Cubital tunnel syndrome， the second most common upper-extremity compres-sive neuropathy after carpal tunnel syndrome， is a term used to describe symptoms related to ulnar nerve compression and/or traction around the elbow. Cubital tunnel syndrome includes any ulnar neuropathy in the mid-arm to mid-forearm.\n\n【24】The ulnar nerve is the terminal branch of the medial cord of the brachial plexus(C8-T1). The nerve courses between the medial head of the triceps and the bra-chialis muscle before coursing posterior to the medial epicondyle and entering the cubital tunnel. The tunnel's anatomic borders are as follows： Anterior， medial epi-condyle； posterior， olecranon； floor， medial collateral ligament； roof， arcuate ligament. After leaving the cubital tunnel， the ulnar nerve passes into the forearm between the 2 heads of the FCU and exits under the deep flexor pronator aponeu-rosis. At this point it lies deep to the FDS and FCU and superficial to the FDP. There are several major sites at which the ulnar nerve often becomes compressed：\n\n【25】1\\. Arcade of Struthers： Band of fascia connecting the medial head of the triceps with the medial intermuscular septum， approximately 7 to 10 cm proximal to the medial epicondyle\n\n【26】2\\. Medial intermuscular septum\n\n【27】3\\. Medial head of triceps： Can become hypertrophied in bodybuilders\n删除3：<u>Figure 30-1. Elbow anatomy.

New York， NY： McGraw-Hill； 2010：Fig. 267-1.</u></u>\n\n【28】4\\. Medial epicondyle： Can cause compressive or traction forces via deformity from a prior supracondylar fracture (Tardy ulnar nerve palsy owing to development of progressive valgus deformity associated with these fractures) or osteophytes in an arthritic elbow\n\n【29】5\\. Arcuate ligament： The roof of the cubital tunnel\n\n【30】6\\. Osborne fascia： This is the proximal fibrous edge of the FCU and most common site of ulnar nerve compression\n\n【31】7\\. Epicondylar groove： A shallow groove increasing risk of ulnar nerve subluxation； a site where external compression can occur from leaning on a flexed elbow for prolonged period of time\n\n【32】8\\. Anconeus epitrochlearis： Accessory muscle arising from medial olecranon and triceps and inserting on the medial epicondyle； seen in 10% of patients undergo-ing cubital tunnel release\n\n【33】9\\. Deep flexor pronator aponeurosis\n\n【34】Physical Exam\n\n【35】Patients often present with poorly localized numbness and tingling in their hand. At times they are able to localize the symptoms in an ulnar nerve distribution.\n\n【36】The symptoms can be occasional or constant and exacerbated by elbow flexion. With longstanding ulnar nerve compression， patients may have wasting of their intrinsic muscles and hand weakness. An intrinsic minus or claw hand (hyperex-tension of the metacarpal phalangeal joints and flexion of the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints) may result from longstanding compression. Look for a Wart-enberg sign (ulnar deviation of the small finger)-patients complain of inability to put their hand in their pocket or their small finger getting caught on things. Patients may have weakness of their pinch and compensate by flexing the thumb interpha-langeal joint during pinching (Froment sign).\n\n【37】Patients may complain of medial elbow pain and have a positive Tinel test (exac-erbation of the ulnar hand numbness by tapping on the ulnar nerve). It is important to do a thorough neck and shoulder exam to rule out nerve compression proximal to the elbow. This includes cervical range of motion to evaluate for associated pain and/or radiculopathy. Range the elbow and evaluate for ulnar nerve subluxation. The functional range of motion of the elbow is 30 to 130 degrees. The normal carrying angle is 7 to 15 degrees. Sensation in the hand should also be examined.\n\n【38】Radiographs of the elbow should be evaluated for osseous causes of compression(ie， osteophytes). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)， although not typically indi-cated， can identify space-occupying lesions or edema within the nerve. Electrodi-agnostic testing， which includes EMG and nerve conduction studies， is the gold standard to evaluate for ulnar neuropathy. Nerve conduction studies are considered positive if the motor conduction velocity across the elbow is less than 52 m/s， increased distal sensory latency of greater than 3.2 ms， and motor latencies of greater than5.3 ms. Of note， abnormal EMG results are associated with poor surgical outcomes.\n\n【39】To determine the appropriate treatment for a patient with cubital tunnel syndrome， the following considerations must be taken into account： patient compliance， worker's compensation， occupation， age， comorbidities， duration of symptoms， and severity of symptoms. Additionally， the orthopaedist must be certain that other causes of the patient's symptoms have been ruled out and that concurrent carpal tunnel syndrome(present in 40% of patients with cubital tunnel syndrome) is not present， which often requires simultaneous release.\n\n【40】For patients with mild cubital tunnel syndrome， nonsurgical options can alleviate symptoms and help prevent long-term nerve damage. A splint that keeps the elbow at approximately 70 degrees of flexion， especially when worn at night， can allevi-ate symptom exacerbation. Physical therapy (PT) that works on nerve mobilization and gliding， in addition to activity modification， can also aid in symptom relief. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as well as soft elbow padding can also be used.\n\n【41】For patients with constant numbness/tingling， muscle atrophy， muscle weakness， or severe slowing of conduction velocity， surgical intervention is recommended. Surgery includes decompressing the nerve with or without transposition. This is achieved via in situ decompression (decompressing the nerve and leaving it where it is)， subcutaneous transposition (moving the nerve anterior to the medial epicon-dyle)， intramuscular transposition (moving the nerve into an area surrounded by the flexor-pronator muscles)， submuscular transposition (moving the nerve under the 删除换行 flexor-pronator muscles)， and medial epicondylectomy (removing part of the medial epicondyle). The cubital tunnel can also be released endoscopically.\n\n【42】Most cases of cubital tunnel syndrome requiring surgical intervention can be treated with in situ decompression. There are inherent risks with nerve trans-position， including compromised blood supply， nerve scarring， injury to adjacent structures， and a longer incision. Studies have shown that in situ decompression is adequate for most patients and has equivalent outcomes to decompression with transposition. Patients with a hypermobile nerve will likely benefit from moving the nerve to a new location.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 12:01:55", "endTime": "2024/09/12 12:02:08", "cost": 13.044}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:31", "update_time": "2024-09-11 20:02:09", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 20:01:55"}

It has been several years since he has been to the doctor. His past medical history is significant for an acute illness at the age of nine, which involved a high fever, pleuritic chest pain, migrating joint pain, and a pink, nonpruritic rash on his torso. His blood pressure is 155/100 mm Hg and heart rate is 70/min. Auscultation of the heart reveals a low-pitched diastolic rumble heard best at the apex. What is the most likely pressure change that would be seen in this patient’s heart?\n\n【1】> (A) Decreased left atrial pressure\n\n【2】> (B) Decreased left ventricular pressure\n\n【3】> (C) Increased left atrial pressure\n\n【4】> (D) Increased left ventricular pressure\n\n【5】> (E) Increased right atrial pressure\n\n【6】 Answer: The correct answer is C . The patient’s history of a prior illness with features of fever, pleuritic chest pain, joint pain, and rash (probably erythema marginatum) is indicative of rheumatic fever. If left untreated, rheumatic fever can evolve into rheumatic heart disease, which typically presents with mitral valve stenosis. This can be heard on auscultation as a highpitched opening snap that follows S2 , and a low-frequency decrescendo diastolic murmur heard best over the apex of the heart. The increased resistance to flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle leads to an increase in left atrial pressure.  \n\n【7】Answer A is incorrect . Left atrial pressure would increase, not decrease, with mitral stenosis.  \n\n【8】Answer B is incorrect . Mitral stenosis would not result in an overall decrease in left ventricular pressure; pressure will only be decreased relative to the left atrium.  \n\n【9】Answer D is incorrect . Left ventricular pressure would increase with aortic stenosis. Rheumatic heart disease most typically presents as mitral stenosis, although aortic stenosis is the next most common presentation.  \n\n【10】Answer E is incorrect . Right atrial pressure would increase in response to pulmonic valve stenosis or tricuspid valve stenosis. The tricuspid valve is sometimes affected in rheumatic heart disease and would also cause a diastolic murmur. However, this is far less common than mitral stenosis in the setting of rheumatic heart disease. In fact, the pulmonic valve is the least likely to be affected in rheumatic heart disease.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 11:25:03", "endTime": "2024/09/12 11:25:11", "cost": 7.931}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:31", "update_time": "2024-09-11 19:25:11", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 19:25:03"}

Prior to shipment, the rays were diagnosed with coc-cidia based on finding of oocysts in aspirates obtained from the spiral intestine. The stingrays were treated once with praziquantel before being shipped. On arrival to the aquarium, the stingrays were placed in a quarantine tank. Following 3 weeks since their arrival, the rays were presented for reevaluation of the coccidiosis.

There is evidence that aspiration risk may be reduced by placing a nasogastric tube before surgery but long-term use actually predisposes a person to aspiration pneumonia. Giving the patient a histamine H <sub>2 </sub> \\-receptor antagonist may also decrease the risk of aspiration by decreasing gastric acid secretion. It is a preventative measure. Expectorated sputum is unreliable for anaerobic cultures because of likely contamination by oral flora.\n\n【12】Question: 38.3 A 42-year-old man underwent open reduction and internal fixation of a comminuted fracture of the right femur.

Both sodium and water follow the chloride into the lumen and result in the secretory diarrhea.\n\n【9】CLINICAL CORRELATION\n\n【10】Diarrhea can be seen in a variety of conditions and disease processes. There are four basic mechanisms that result in diarrhea： osmotic (lactose intoler-ance)， exudative disorders (inflammatory bowel disease)， secretory (V cholerae)， and motility disturbance (hyperthyroidism). Diarrhea from cholera has a rapid onset and can lead to progressive dehydration and even death. The incubation period is about 24 to 48 hours， after which the patient will begin having pain-less watery diarrhea. The diarrhea is free from blood and appears like rice water. Patients often complain of muscle cramps that result from electrolyte abnormalities. Complications are a result of the fluid loss and electrolyte abnormalities. When patients are adequately hydrated and electrolytes are replaced， the process is self-limiting and resolves in a few days. The diagno-sis can be confirmed by the identification of V. cholerae in stool.\n\n【11】APPROACH TO WATER ABSORPTION\n\n【12】Objectives\n\n【13】1\\. Discuss sodium and water absorption and secretion in the small intes-tine and colon.\n\n【14】2\\. Describe potassium， chloride， and bicarbonate absorption and secre-tion in the small intestine and colon.\n\n【15】DISCUSSION\n\n【16】Approximately 9 L of water and 30 g of sodium are absorbed from the small intestine and colon each day， but only about 2 L of water and 5 g of sodium are ingested. The difference between absorbed and ingested values is 删除换行 because of salivary， gastric， pancreatic， biliary， and intestinal secretions， which then are reabsorbed. The vast majority of this fluid is absorbed by the small intestine， with only about 1 to 2 L being absorbed from the colon. Normally， only about 0.1 to 0.2 L is excreted in the feces.\n\n【17】Throughout the GI tract， water permeates membranes passively to main-tain isosmotic conditions (except for salivary secretions， which are hypotonic， and colonic contents， which are hypertonic) as solutes are actively secreted and absorbed. Salivary glands， the stomach， the pancreas， and the liver are mainly secretory organs， as discussed in Case 30. The intestine， in contrast， has both secretory and absorptive functions. Under normal conditions， absorption dominates， but as in this case， that is not always the case. The mechanisms involved in small intestinal absorption of the products of digestion are covered in Case 31. This absorption， which is accompanied by significant amounts of sodium， chloride， and water， is accomplished by villus epithelial cells. Intestinal secretion， by contrast， is accomplished by crypt epithelial cells.\n\n【18】There are multiple pathways and mechanisms by which sodium is absorbed by villus cells of the intestine. The major ones are the sodium-coupled absorp-tion of sugars and amino acids， sodium-chloride cotransport， sodium-hydrogen countertransport， and the entry of sodium by restricted diffusion. All these are secondary active processes that are “powered” by the sodium-potassium ATPase located on the basolateral borders of the villus cells. With this absorp-tion comes the passive absorption of anions， mostly chloride， and water. Potassium is absorbed by both passive and active processes. In the small intes-tine， potassium is concentrated in the chyme as sodium and water are absorbed， but because the paracellular pathways are“leaky，” potassium is absorbed pas-sively down its electrochemical gradient. In the colon， which is less leaky， potassium is absorbed through a primary active process involving a potassium-hydrogen ATPase. Potassium also is secreted actively by colonic villus cells because of the restricted diffusion of potassium through apical membrane chan-nels. Thus， as sodium is absorbed， potassium is lost. The net result is that fecal fluid has a relatively high potassium concentration. The situation with bicar-bonate is also complicated. Most of the secreted bicarbonate acts to neutralize the acid secreted by the stomach. This results in no net loss or gain of bicar-bonate because the secretion of acid involves the production of bicarbonate to balance that which is secreted by the pancreas and liver. In the distal small intestine and colon， bicarbonate is secreted in exchange for chloride through the action of a chloride-bicarbonate countertransporter on the apical membrane of villus cells. Thus， fecal secretions tend to be alkaline.\n\n【19】There normally is a low level of secretion of sodium， chloride， and water by crypt epithelial cells of the small intestine because of the secondary active transport of chloride. A sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter is located on the basolateral surface of these cells . Thus， the movement of sodium down its electrochemical gradient facilitates the uptake of chloride. This chloride then exits the apical membrane down its electrochemi-cal gradient by restricted diffusion through a chloride channel. Sodium and\n删除3：<u>Figure 32-1. Crypt cells of the intestine. Cl-is secreted by a secondary active process.</u>\n\n【20】water follow passively through paracellular pathways. The fluid secreted by these cells helps maintain the liquidity of the intestinal contents and aids in digestion and absorption. The activity of the chloride channel is regulated by both calcium and cAMP. Elevations of either caused by actions of neuro-transmitters， or in this case toxins， increase flux through the channels and result in an increase in secretion. This secretion can exceed the ability of the villus cells to absorb， thus resulting in diarrhea rich in volume， potassium， and bicar-bonate. Fortunately， the absorptive abilities of the villus cells are large and can be maximized by orally administering fluids that are rich in sodium and glu-cose. This is the basis for the oral rehydration (replacement) therapies that have been so successful in decreasing mortality from secretory diarrhea.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 13:47:39", "endTime": "2024/09/12 13:47:46", "cost": 7.107}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:31", "update_time": "2024-09-11 21:47:47", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 20:04:15"}

Hereditary hemochromatosis is an iron-overload disease caused by mutations in the HFE gene. Patients classically present with the triad of diabetes, cirrhosis, and bronze skin pigmentation. This patient has many of the signs of advanced hereditary hemochromatosis: diabetes due to pancreatic iron deposition, heart failure as a result of cardiac iron deposition, cirrhosis from hepatic iron deposition, and testicular atrophy as a result of dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary system from iron deposition. In addition, one of his siblings is also affected, indicating the autosomal recessive nature of the disease. The brown granular pigment in hepatocytes seen in the image suggests hemosiderosis, but an iron stain (Prussian blue) is also necessary because the brown pigment resembles lipofuscin in hematoxylin and eosin stains.  \n\n【6】Answer A is incorrect. α1 \\-Antitrypsin deficiency is due to mutations in the protease inhibitor gene on chromosome 14. α1 \\-Antitrypsin is a protein produced in the liver and has a number of functions, the most common being protection of the lungs from elastase, an enzyme produced by neutrophils. Patients with a deficiency in this protein may present with respiratory complaints and can develop emphysema. In some patients, cirrhosis may occur due to accumulation of α1 \\-antitrypsin in the liver. Histopathologic examination would not show brown granular pigment in hepatocytes. Rather, microscopic examination of a liver biopsy would show periodic acid Schiff-positive, diastase-resistant globules in hepatocytes.  \n\n【7】Answer B is incorrect. Intracytoplasmic hyaline inclusions derived from cytokeratin intermediate filaments called Mallory bodies and microvesicular steatosis are common findings in alcoholic hepatitis. Accumulation of iron is not associated with this condition.  \n\n【8】Answer C is incorrect. Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the CFTR gene on chromosome 7. This gene encodes for a chloride ion channel. Patients typically present early in life with meconium ileus, multiple respiratory tract infections, or failure to thrive. Patients typically have a number of upper and lower pulmonary manifestations, especially recurrent respiratory infections. Patients also have GI symptoms due to insufficient release of pancreatic enzymes for digestion. This causes protein and fat malabsorption, leading to steatorrhea and fatsoluble vitamin deficiencies.  \n\n【9】Answer E is incorrect. Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disease of copper accumulation in various tissues. It is due to mutations in the ATP7B gene, which encodes a coppertransporting ATPase. Patients may have a variety of hepatic manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic hepatomegaly to acute fulminant hepatitis. They also have neurologic manifestations such as tremor, dysarthria, or gait abnormalities. Psychiatric manifestations, such as mood or personality changes, are also common, and Kayser-Fleischer rings are evident on ophthalmic exam in almost all patients.

Utilization of ketone bodies for energy generation\n\n【19】E. Lactic acid in the blood causing acidosis\n\n【20】Answer: 16.3 E. Gluconeogenesis requires ATP, which is in short supply, turning up the catabolism of glucose to lactate in the absence of an intact electron transport chain. ADP cannot be transported into the mitochondrion because ATP, its antiporter partner, is not made by oxidative phosphorylation as a result of cyanide inhibition of cytochrome oxidase. Metabolism of fatty acids and ketone bodies requires a functional electron transport chain for their metabolism, and these possibilities are also ruled out.\n\n【21】Question: 16.4 Which of the following procedures best describes the emergency intervention for cyanide poisoning?\n\n【22】A. Decrease the partial pressure of oxygen\n\n【23】B. Treatment with nitrites to convert hemoglobin to methemoglobin.\n\n【24】C. Treatment with thiosulfate to form thiocyanate\n\n【25】D. Use of N-acetylcysteine taken orally\n\n【26】Answer: 16.4 B. Increased oxygen competes with cyanide bound to cytochrome oxidase displacing it. Nitrites bind to hemoglobin, converting it to methemoglobin, which binds cyanide more tightly than cyanhemoglobin and pulls cyanide from cyanhemoglobin to form cyanomethemoglobin. Thiosulfate is used to displace cyanide from cyanomethemoglobin to form thiocyanate, which can be excreted, a happy ending for cyanide poisoning. N-acetylcysteine is used for acetaminophen toxicity, not cyanide toxicity.\n\n【27】Question: 16.5 An unskilled worker in a water garden/plant nursery was sent to sweep up a spill of a white powder in the storage shed. Later he was found with labored breathing and convulsions. On further examination, the white powder was identified as rotenone. Respiratory distress is induced on rotenone exposure because it inhibits the complex that catalyzes which of the following?\n\n【28】A. Electron transfer from NADH to coenzyme Q\n\n【29】B. Oxidation of coenzyme Q\n\n【30】C. Reduction of cytochrome c\n\n【31】D. Electron transfer from cytochrome c to cytochrome a <sub>1 </sub> /a <sub>3</sub>\n\n【32】E. Electron transfer from cytochrome a <sub>1 </sub> /a <sub>3 </sub> to oxygen\n\n【33】Answer: 16.5 A. Rotenone binds avidly to the flavoprotein NADH CoQ reductase, complex I (also called NADH dehydrogenase). The central portion of the rotenone structure resembles the isoalloxazine ring of the FMN molecule, and when it binds to complex I, rotenone prevents the transfer of electrons from NADH to coenzyme Q.\n\n【34】Question: 16.6 The major metabolic consequence of perturbation of the electron transfer in mitochondria is which of the following?\n\n【35】A. Increased production of NADPH\n\n【36】B. Increased oxidation of NADH\n\n【37】C. Increased reduction of O <sub>2 </sub> to H <sub>2 </sub> O\n\n【38】D. Decreased regeneration of NAD <sup>+</sup>\n\n【39】E. Decreased reduction of FAD\nAnswer: 16.6 D. Inhibition of the electron transport chain shuts down the major pathway of regenerating NAD <sup>+ </sup> from the NADH produced in intermediary metabolism. This forces the cytosolic conversion of pyruvate to lactate to regenerate NAD <sup>+ </sup> so that glycolysis can continue in the absence of a functioning electron transport system.\n\n【40】BIOCHEMISTRY PEARLS\n\n【41】 The ETC or ETS is located on the inner membrane of the mitochondrion and is responsible for the harnessing of free energy. The chain consists of a series of carriers arranged along the inner membrane of mitochondria that transport electrons from NADH and reduced flavin carriers to molecular oxygen.\n\n【42】 Energy is released as electrons travel from more reduced (more negative reduction potential,  ) to more oxidized (more positive  ) carriers to drive the phosphorylation of ADP to ATP.\n\n【43】 The components of the electron transport chain have various cofactors, which form vital complexes.\n\n【44】 The disruption of various complexes may interfere with the ETC, leading to inability to manufacture ATP.\n\n【45】 The energy gained from electron transfer is used to drive protons out of the inner mitochondrial matrix to the cytosol, establishing a gradient of protons. Because the protons come back into the matrix via the ATP synthase complex, ADP is phosphorylated to ATP.\n\n【46】 The normal mitochondria produce ATP as they transport electrons to oxygen; any interference with ATP synthesis or translocation across the mitochondrial membrane will inhibit electron transfer.\n\n【47】 Rotenone binds avidly to the flavoprotein NADH CoQ reductase, complex I (also called NADH dehydrogenase).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 13:53:28", "endTime": "2024/09/12 13:54:24", "cost": 56.317}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:31", "update_time": "2024-09-11 21:54:24", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 21:53:28"}

The term emotional intelligence is used by Goleman 通用删除7(英):<u>(1995)</u> and Bar-On 通用删除7(英):<u>(1997)</u> in an overly broad way, including components of social awareness, autonomous functioning, and relationship skills.\n\n【7】### Emotional Competencies\n\n【8】   Awareness and experiencing: Being open to experience all feelings, without suppression; feeling the feeling in awareness, not thinking about the feeling.\n   Labeling: Giving names to feelings and differentiating them from physical states.\n   Understanding: Using self-reflection to learn about causes of emotional experiences; recognizing metaemotions —emotions about emotions.\n   Emotional expression: Able to express feelings fully with a trusted confidante.\n   Empathy: Able to be aware of, understand, and appreciate the feelings of others.\n   Emotional regulation: Able to monitor, evaluate, and modify emotional reactions to accomplish one’s goals 删除10：<u>(Thompson, 1994)</u>.\n\n【9】#### Emotional Regulation\n\n【10】Emotional regulation involves the ability to both increase and decrease emotional levels. Overregulation of emotions is apparent in people with alexithymia, a disorder characterized by the inability to identify and describe feelings in self and others. (The word alexithymia is Greek for “no words for emotion.”) A research instrument for assessing for alexithymia 删除10：<u>(Bagby, Taylor, & Parker, 1994)</u> uses three scales: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> difficulty identifying feelings and distinguishing them from emotionally driven somatic sensations; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> difficulty describing feelings; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> a concrete, externally oriented style of thinking. Research on this construct 删除10：<u>(e.g. Levant, Halter, Hayden & Williams, 2009; Parker, Keefer, Taylor, & Bagby, 2008)</u> has found it to be a continuous dimension, like a personality trait, rather than a categorical construct.\n\n【11】Most emphasis has been placed on the need to dampen excessive emotions, through both self-management and interpersonal strategies. The child development literature notes how children use self-comforting, help-seeking, and distraction strategies to manage frustration and fear 删除10：<u>(Calkins, Gill, Johnson, & Smith, 1999)</u>. Gross 通用删除7(英):<u>(2008)</u> identifies three types of strategies to regulate emotion: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> situation-based (leave or change the environments that evoke unwanted emotion); 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> cognitive (manage deployment of attention and revise appraisal of situations in a way that alters its emotional significance); and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> response modulation (e.g. suppressing emotions or engaging in activities that substitute different emotions).\n\n【12】Linehan’s (1993a; 1993b) approach to working with borderline personality disorder (BPD) puts emotional dysregulation as the central symptom. Whether from genetics, fetal environment, or early childhood trauma, people who develop BPD are characterized by heightened emotional sensitivity, heightened reactivity, and delayed recovery following emotional arousal. Robins and Rosenthal 通用删除7(英):<u>(2011)</u> explain that many symptoms are viewed as attempts at emotional regulation (e.g. self-injury, substance abuse, binging and purging, as well as suicide attempts) or as long-term effects of dysregulated emotions (e.g. unstable relationships, impaired sense of self). Greenberg 通用删除7(英):<u>(2008)</u> makes an important point: before people can feel safe to experience strong emotions, they need to feel confidence in their ability to tolerate and regulate them.\n\n【13】### When Is This Hypothesis a Good Match?\n\n【14】All patients require a therapist who responds empathically to emotional expression, and provides a place where feelings can be explored and understood. The Emotional Focus hypothesis is used when the client needs to overcome avoidance of feelings, or develop specific competencies to ensure healthy emotional functioning. Table 9.5 gives examples of problems for which this hypothesis is a good match.\n\n【15】Table 9.5 Sample Problems for Emotional Focus (BE4) Hypothesis\n\n| Alexithymia | Parker and colleagues 通用删除7(英):<u>(2008)</u> report that difficulties in identifying, distinguishing, and describing feelings are associated with the following disorders: eating disorders, PTSD, somatoform disorders 通用删除1(英):<u>(including somatization disorder, conversion disorder, pain disorder, and hypochondriasis)</u>, and functional gastrointestinal disorders. |\n| --- | --- |\n| Somatization | Somatization refers to the process of expressing psychological or mental difficulties through physical symptoms; it takes a number of forms, ranging from preoccupation with potential or genuine but mild physical problems to the development of actual physical pain, discomfort, or dysfunction. These disorders have been conceived as a developmental deficit that is associated with lower levels of emotional awareness involving undifferentiated emotional arousal with a focus on body sensations 删除10：<u>(Waller & Scheidt, 2006)</u>. Somatization is more common in cultures where emotional expression of stress and anxiety is discouraged. The expectation for reduction in somatic symptoms when clients are able to fully express their emotional experience has found support 删除10：<u>(e.g. Abbass, 2005)</u>. |\n| Avoidance of specific emotions | Difficulty experiencing and expressing certain emotions (assumed to be those that were ignored or punished in childhood), while having no problem expressing other emotions. (Gender and culture influences the socialization process.)Difficulties being vulnerable and expressing emotions in intimate relationships. The person may have shame and anxiety about certain feelings and predict negative relationship consequences. Some people have a pattern of excessive self-reliance, social isolation, and an avoidance of intimate connections.Lack of ability to experience and tolerate unpleasant emotions. Tactics to eliminate unpleasant emotional experiences include rumination and distortions of reality through projection and displacement. Many problems and disorders can be formulated as an inability to tolerate emotional pain along with maladaptive avoidance behaviors (e.g. obsessions and compulsions, agoraphobia, kleptomania, aggressive acting out behaviors, addictions to substances as well as to unsatisfying relationships, and suicide). |\n| Eating disorders | Davis 通用删除7(英):<u>(2010)</u>, in her literature review of patients’ perspectives on ED treatment, found that patients reported positive effects of: becoming aware of feelings, learning why they feel guilty, discovering that anger cannot destroy the person it is aimed at, and becoming able to tolerate feelings without engaging in problem behaviors 删除10：<u>(Beresin, Gordon, & Herzog, 1989; LeGrange & Gelman, 1998)</u>. Federici and Kaplan 通用删除7(英):<u>(2008)</u> found that participants who maintained a healthy weight attributed their success to having dealt with negative feelings and being prepared to cope with such feelings in the future, whereas those who relapsed felt that emotional issues were overlooked. |\n| Trauma | The processing of emotional experiences is part of the treatment of people with PTSD, survivors of recent traumatic events such as combat and rape, and survivors of early childhood traumatic abuse and neglect. |\n\n【17】### Treatment Planning\n\n【18】The therapist needs to provide a positive relationship in which the client feels safe to experience threatening and painful emotions. Some desired qualities of the therapist include comfort in the presence of all emotions, the ability to demonstrate empathic attunement to clients of various cultures, and the ability to model congruent expressions of emotions. Fosha 通用删除7(英):<u>(2001)</u> writes:\n\n【19】> Being in an emotionally connected relationship based on empathic attunement and support enhances the person’s capacity to feel without needing to develop strategies to minimize, numb, or mute feelings. \n\n【20】Therapists should also be aware of the risks of exceeding the limits of their competence when they encourage intense emotional expression by the client. Activation of trauma-related emotional experience can do more harm than good: according to the principles of exposure , a session should not end until the client’s SUDS level has fallen. Otherwise exposure to traumatic stimuli can result in greater distress and/or avoidance.\n\n【21】#### Rationale for Focusing on Feelings\n\n【22】One of the challenges for therapists is working with someone who uses somatic complaints as the idiom of help seeking. The client who is referred by a physician to a mental health professional will not collaborate in emotion-focused work unless he accepts a rationale that shows how that kind of therapy is relevant to physical problems. Other clients, who expect to tell long narratives about their problems, can be frustrated with a shift to here-and-now emotional experience. Some clients fear that deep experience of their emotions will result in their automatically acting on them. Here are some examples of what therapists can say:\n\n【23】   Holding your feelings in takes energy and causes tension, which increases your health symptoms.\n   Your feelings give you information about what you enjoy, who you love, what you won’t tolerate.\n   Knowing the truth of your feelings allows you to drop the mechanisms that keep feelings out of awareness and create difficulties in life.\n   By exposing yourself to painful feelings, and staying with them, you’ll begin a process of healing that can’t occur if you keep avoiding them.\n   Expressing feelings and trusting the other person to not hurt you is part of intimacy. You can practice that here.\n   Feelings that are chronically suppressed can be the most dangerous. By experiencing them a little at a time, you get a chance to integrate them.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 14:11:17", "endTime": "2024/09/12 14:11:34", "cost": 16.587}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:31", "update_time": "2024-09-11 22:11:33", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 22:11:16"}

Although numerous definitions exist 删除10：<u>(Egan et al. 2014 )</u>, most emphasize the multidimensional nature of perfectionism. At its broadest level, perfectionism takes both adaptive and maladaptive forms, with only maladaptive perfectionism associated with psychopathology 删除10：<u>(Bieling et al. 2004a )</u>. More precise definitions of the construct have characterized perfectionism by the focus or target of the perfectionistic behaviors 删除10：<u>(Hewitt and Flett 1991 )</u> and by the content of the perfectionistic beliefs 删除10：<u>(Frost et al. 1990 )</u>. Hewitt and Flett 通用删除7(英):<u>( 1991 )</u> described perfectionism along the dimensions of self-oriented perfectionism, other-oriented perfectionism, and socially prescribed perfectionism, whereas Frost et al. 通用删除7(英):<u>( 1990 )</u> described six dimensions of perfectionistic beliefs, including concern over mistakes, personal standards, parental expectations, parental criticism, doubts about actions, and organization. Despite the obvious differences in how these two models conceptualize the nature of perfectionism, there is considerable overlap among the dimensions, and they can be seen as complementary, rather than contradictory, ways of understanding a complex phenomenon.\n\n【15】Perfectionism is not a diagnostic category in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 删除10：<u>(DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association 2013 )</u>, nor is it a diagnostic criterion of any disorder, except obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) . Clinically, however, many therapists recognize the prevalence and impact of perfectionism in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). OCPD and OCD are overlapping, but distinct, diagnostic entities, although there appears to be a subtype or phenotype of OCD that is characterized by elevated perfectionism 删除10：<u>(Mancebo et al. 2005 )</u>. In fact, perfectionism has recently been identified as one of the core dimensions of OCD. The Obsessive Compulsive Cognitions Working Group (OCCWG) developed a comprehensive cognitive model of OCD in which they identified three primary domains of cognitions that are prominent in OCD: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> responsibility and threat estimation, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> perfectionism and intolerance for uncertainty, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> importance and control of thoughts 删除10：<u>(OCCWG 1997 , 2001 , 2005 )</u>. Within OCD, the working group described “perfectionism” as holding unrealistically high standards for oneself and others, with mistakes being perceived as intolerable, and “intolerance of uncertainty ” as beliefs in the need for certainty and that one has little ability to cope with unpredictability .\n\n【16】Although perfectionism has been implicated as a transdiagnostic risk and maintaining factor, studies indicate that perfectionism is particularly elevated in OCD 删除10：<u>(Egan et al. 2011 )</u>. In several studies, individuals with OCD report elevated concern over mistakes and doubts about actions compared to nonclinical controls 删除10：<u>(Antony et al. 1998 ; Buhlmann et al. 2008 ; Frost and Steketee 1997 )</u>; however, only doubts about actions tend to distinguish OCD from other anxiety disorders 删除10：<u>(Antony et al. 1998 ; Frost and Steketee 1997 )</u>. Perfectionism in OCD manifests as difficulty in making decisions and doubts about the accuracy of one’s decisions, taking longer to categorize items, and experiencing extreme distress when faced with ambiguous situations. This is evidenced by a greater frequency of obsessions and compulsions related to symmetry, ordering, repeating, cleaning, and hoarding associated with high perfectionism 删除10：<u>(Coles et al. 2008 )</u>.\n\n【17】Other OCD presentations have also been hypothesized to be motivated by perfectionism, including incompleteness 删除10：<u>(Rasmussen and Eisen 1989 ; Summerfeldt 2004 )</u> and “not just right” experiences 删除10：<u>(Coles et al. 2003 ; Leckman et al. 1994 )</u>, in which compulsions are performed until an internal felt sense is achieved that the outcome is “just right,” with no anticipated consequences or expectations of harm. These conceptualizations are thought to be underlying factors that cut across overt symptom profiles; however, they are often observed among individuals with symmetry, ordering, and arranging compulsions.\n\n【18】Given that perfectionism is often recognized as a transdiagnostic process that confers a vulnerability for a variety of psychological disorders 删除10：<u>(Egan et al. 2011 )</u>, it is unsurprising that elevated levels of perfectionism are associated with higher comorbidity 删除10：<u>(Bieling et al. 2004b )</u> and poorer treatment prognosis 删除10：<u>(Chik et al. 2008 )</u>. Chik et al. 通用删除7(英):<u>( 2008 )</u> found that doubts about actions, the dimension of perfectionism that appears to be particularly pronounced in OCD, predicted poorer response to group and individual behavioral and cognitive therapy for OCD. Possible explanations for this effect on treatment outcome include the interfering effects of perfectionism on a person’s ability to tolerate exposure, consider alternative evidence, or complete homework exercises 删除10：<u>(Frost et al. 2002 )</u>. Despite these complications, individuals with elevated perfectionism in OCD can and do respond to psychological interventions, often associated with a somewhat attenuated treatment response. Thus, clinical outcomes may be enhanced when perfectionistic beliefs and behaviors are the focus of clinical attention 删除10：<u>(e.g. Pleva and Wade 2007 ; Riley et al. 2007 )</u> .\n\n【19】An evidence-based approach to the treatment of perfectionism OCD incorporates a multimodal assessment and cognitive behavioral strategies for targeting perfectionistic beliefs and behaviors early in treatment 删除10：<u>(Egan et al. 2011 )</u>. Although ERP is the treatment of choice for perfectionism-based OCD, it may be augmented with cognitive strategies directed at challenging rigid, all-or-nothing, perfectionistic beliefs with the use of thought records, identifying and challenging double standards, cost/benefit analysis of striving for perfectionism, and psychoeducation about the elusiveness of perfection. Behavioral experiments, such as deliberately making errors to see if predicted catastrophic consequences occur, should be designed to test out perfectionistic cognitions. The following case illustrates the implementation of a comprehensive cognitive behavioral treatment plan for OCD, specifically addressing prominent perfectionistic beliefs and behaviors .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 13:50:33", "endTime": "2024/09/12 13:52:14", "cost": 101.334}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:31", "update_time": "2024-09-11 21:52:13", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 21:50:31"}

She is in fulminant hepatic failure. She requires immediate transfer to the intensive删除8：<u>￾</u>care unit for optimal management and prevention of further complications such as renal  删除换行 failure, cerebral oedema, sepsis and gastrointestinal bleeding. She is at risk of a rapid  删除换行 decline in consciousness if encephalopathy worsens and may need intubation to protect  删除换行 her airway if this occurs. She requires invasive monitoring in the form of central venous  删除换行 and arterial lines to help provide optimal intravascular filling and electrolyte replace删除8：<u>￾</u>ments. Blood glucose should be monitored regularly as hypoglycaemia can occur.\n\n【24】Discussion with a tertiary referral centre for liver transplantation should be made. The  删除换行 decision for liver transplantation can be very difficult and is based on the probability  删除换行 of spontaneous hepatic recovery. Various criteria exist to guide decisions on transplan删除8：<u>￾</u>tation. For instance, the King’s College Hospital criteria include a prothrombin time of \n\n【25】>100 seconds (independent of grade of encephalopathy) or any three of the following:  删除换行 age <10 or >40; aetiology (non-A, non-B hepatitis, halothane hepatitis, idiosyncratic  删除换行 drug reactions); duration of jaundice before onset of encephalopathy >7 days; pro删除8：<u>￾</u>thrombin time >50 seconds; bilirubin >308 mmol/L.\n\n【26】Identifying the cause of hepatic failure is important as it can determine further therapy  删除换行 and also the likelihood of suitability for liver transplantation. There are several causes  删除换行 of fulminant liver failure, which include viral (hepatitis A, B and D), idiosyncratic (cou删除8：<u>￾</u>marins, carbamezepin, valproic acid, halogenated hydrocarbons), toxins (paracetamol,  删除换行 isoniazid, methotrexate, Amanita phalloides toxin), metabolic (Wilson’s disease), and  删除换行 vascular (Budd–Chiari syndrome).\n\n【27】In this case she has features suggesting that autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) could be the  删除换行 underlying cause. Blood tests that can help diagnose AIH include anti-SLA/LP (anti删除8：<u>￾</u>soluble liver antigens or liver/pancreas). These are highly specific for type 1 AIH. Other  删除换行 tests include anti-SMA, and anti-LKM-1 (positive in type 2 AIH). Liver biopsy is essen删除8：<u>￾</u>tial to establish the diagnosis and determine severity but can be problematic if there is  删除换行 impaired clotting function. The liver is involved with the modification and production of  删除换行 clotting factors, such as vitamin K. Hepatic failure can lead to impaired clotting (as seen  删除换行 in this case, where the patient has an elevated INR and signs of bruising). The character删除8：<u>￾</u>istic finding is periportal lesions or interface hepatitis (portal mononuclear and plasma  删除换行 cell infiltrate). Panacinar hepatitis and centrilobular necrosis can also be features in AIH.\n\n【28】Treatment for autoimmune hepatitis involves corticosteroids and immunosuppressants. \n\n【29】Treatment is recommended for those with serum aminotransferase levels greater than  删除换行 10-fold the upper limit of normal, or greater than 5-fold upper limit of normal if gamma删除8：<u>￾</u>globulin is at least twice the upper limit of normal. If histology shows bridging necrosis  删除换行 or multi-acinar necrosis, treatment is recommended also; combination therapy with pred删除8：<u>￾</u>nisolone and azathioprine is given. In fulminant hepatic failure, monotherapy with pred删除8：<u>￾</u>nisolone (60 mg once daily) can be given with or without consideration for transplant.\n\n【30】AIH can present insidiously with months of mild abdominal discomfort, pruritus, arthral删除8：<u>￾</u>gia and general malaise. It has a poor prognosis with a five-year survival rate of 50 per  删除换行 cent following diagnosis and 10 per cent at 10 years. Liver transplantation in AIH is  删除换行 associated with a five-year patient survival of between 80 and 90 per cent. In some cases \n\n【31】AIH can recur in transplanted livers.删除5：<u>235</u>\nKEY POINTS\n\n【32】• Fulminant hepatic failure requires intensive care and discussion with a liver transplant  删除换行 centre.\n\n【33】• AIH can present in a variety of ways: asymptomatic with raised aminotransferases but  删除换行 no fibrosis, or inflammation found on biopsy, to the rare presentation of acute hepatic  删除换行 failure.删除6：<u>This page intentionally left blank 237</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 11:31:34", "endTime": "2024/09/12 11:32:08", "cost": 34.544}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:31", "update_time": "2024-09-11 19:32:08", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 19:31:34"}

Endometrial cancer\n\n【16】E. Urinary tract infection\n\n【17】ANSWERS\n\n【18】50.1 C. This patient's obesity is the most significant risk factor for endometrial cancer， due to chronically elevated unopposed estrogen levels stored in adi-pose tissue. Parity is protective for endometrial cancer. Risk factors for endo-metrial cancer include anovulatory menstrual cycles， obesity， nulliparity， age greater than 35， and use of tamoxifen or unopposed exogenous estrogen. Interestingly， smoking is a negative risk factor for endometrial cancer.\n\n【19】50.2 A. Estrogen does not have a role in the initial workup for anovulation； serum karyotype is useful for premature ovarian failure but not for anovulation. Urine cortisol may help in the diagnosis of Cushing disease， but not generally indicated unless the patient has other stigmata of corticosteroid excess such as abdominal striae， easy brusability， and buffalo hump. TSH is indicated in DUB workup. Both total serum testosterone levels and prolactin are useful. Thus， in general， a pregnancy test， TSH， and prolactin level are the initial tests for the evaluation of menstrual irregularities.\n\n【20】50.3 C. Endometritis is a common cause of vaginal spotting. It is generally a poly-microbial infection caused by an ascending infection of normal vaginal flora. Commonly isolated organisms include gonorrhea， Chlamydia trachomatis， Ureaplasma urealyticum， Peptostreptococcus， Gardnerella vaginalis， and the group B Streptococcus species. The patient's history makes cervical cancer less likely. Leiomyoma or polyps are possible， but less likely with her history of recent spotting and sexual activity. Endometrial cancer would also be unlikely in a patient with previously regular menses. While a urinary tract infection may cause hematuria in cases of severe cystitis， it would not cause uterine enlargement or tenderness.

Endometrial cancer\n\n【16】E. Urinary tract infection\n\n【17】ANSWERS\n\n【18】50.1 C. This patient's obesity is the most significant risk factor for endometrial cancer， due to chronically elevated unopposed estrogen levels stored in adi-pose tissue. Parity is protective for endometrial cancer. Risk factors for endo-metrial cancer include anovulatory menstrual cycles， obesity， nulliparity， age greater than 35， and use of tamoxifen or unopposed exogenous estrogen. Interestingly， smoking is a negative risk factor for endometrial cancer.\n\n【19】50.2 A. Estrogen does not have a role in the initial workup for anovulation； serum karyotype is useful for premature ovarian failure but not for anovulation. Urine cortisol may help in the diagnosis of Cushing disease， but not generally indicated unless the patient has other stigmata of corticosteroid excess such as abdominal striae， easy brusability， and buffalo hump. TSH is indicated in DUB workup. Both total serum testosterone levels and prolactin are useful. Thus， in general， a pregnancy test， TSH， and prolactin level are the initial tests for the evaluation of menstrual irregularities.\n\n【20】50.3 C. Endometritis is a common cause of vaginal spotting. It is generally a poly-microbial infection caused by an ascending infection of normal vaginal flora. Commonly isolated organisms include gonorrhea， Chlamydia trachomatis， Ureaplasma urealyticum， Peptostreptococcus， Gardnerella vaginalis， and the group B Streptococcus species. The patient's history makes cervical cancer less likely. Leiomyoma or polyps are possible， but less likely with her history of recent spotting and sexual activity. Endometrial cancer would also be unlikely in a patient with previously regular menses. While a urinary tract infection may cause hematuria in cases of severe cystitis， it would not cause uterine enlargement or tenderness.

The separation of the patient should be gradually done in degrees (answer D). This disorder is not a phase but an indicator of subsequent risk for psychiatric illness as an adult (answer E).\n\n【23】18.2 E. Children and adolescents with separation anxiety disorder often present with or later develop symptoms of major depression and panic disorder. In children， this can include a depressed， sad， or irritable mood over an extended period of time. For this reason， children with separation anxiety should be counseled and the families should be aware of these possible developments. The other answer choices (answer A， malingering； answer B， somatization disorder； answer C， bipolar disorder； and answer D， learning disability) are not relevant to this diagnosis.\n\n【24】18.3 B. The FDA recently placed a black box warning for the use of antidepres-sants in children and adolescents. This warning reminds clinicians of some evidence indicating a possible increased incidence of suicidal thoughts among adolescents using antidepressants-particularly SSRIs. That said， treatment should not be withheld since the lack of therapy can also lead to more suicide； thus awareness， counseling， and monitoring are the keys to judicious treat-ment. Although a side effect of SSRI is indigestion and decreased appetite(answer C)， this is not a black box warning. Hypertension (answer D) and hypovolemia (answer A) are not typically associated with SSRI use. In gen-eral， delusions and hallucinations are not noted with SSRI’s， but sporadic events have been noted (answer E).\n\n【25】18.4 E.

It involves coating the surface with the desired antigen (in this case， yellow fever viral particles) and then placing the patient's serum on the surface， followed by a secondary antibody (antihuman antibody) that is linked to an enzyme. If the patient's serum has antibody to the antigen， the secondary antibody will bind. The linked enzyme can be detected by a reaction that produces an alteration in color with a colorimetric agent (eg， horseradish peroxidise). The color change can be quantified by spectroscopy.

ECG showed sinus  删除换行 tachycardia and S-T segment elevation in practically all the leads, with upright \n\n【11】T waves . X-ray chest findings were borderline cardiomegaly and  删除换行 pulmonary interstitial edema but there was no mediastinal widening or pleural  删除换行 effusion. ECHO revealed a mildly dilated left ventricle with an ejection fraction of  删除换行 35%. The distal septum and the left ventricular apex were hypokinetic . \n\n【12】The mitral and aortic valves were structurally normal and no colour flow jet or  删除换行 abnormal velocity was detected. No intracardiac mass or pericardial effusion was  删除换行 seen. The proximal aorta did not show dilatation or any sign of aortic dissection. 68 Section 4 The Cardiomyopathies\n\n【13】Whenever a patient has severe chest pain with S-T segment elevation on ECG \n\n【14】and wall motion abnormality on ECHO, the first possibility to cross the mind is an  删除换行 acute coronary syndrome. This patient had no major coronary risk factors barring  删除换行 psycho-social stress, but her troponin-T test was positive. Since she came to a  删除换行 tertiary-care hospital, primary coronary angioplasty was planned. To everyone’s  删除换行 surprise, the coronary angiogram turned out to be completely normal. \n\n【15】Another cause of severe chest pain with ECG findings is acute dissection  删除换行 of the aorta. These patients are usually hypertensive and develop acute aortic  删除换行 regurgitation with left ventricular volume overload. Our patient had no evidence  删除换行 of aortic root dilatation, cleavage of the aortic wall or aortic regurgitation. Rarely,  删除换行 dissection of the aorta can cause myocardial infarction, if the coronary ostia get  删除换行 occluded by the intimal flap.\n\n【16】Acute pericarditis also presents with chest pain and S-T segment elevation  删除换行 on the ECG. The pain is seldom excruciating and generally increases on deep  删除换行 inspiration. The troponin-T test is almost always negative. Presence of regional  删除换行 wall motion abnormality and reduced ejection fraction are unusual except if  删除换行 there is an additional component of myocarditis. Acute viral myocarditis is often  删除换行 preceded by a flu-like illness. It presents with acute left ventricular dysfunction  删除换行 but chest pain is unusual. Classical findings are global hypokinesia with  删除换行 depressed ejection fraction but regional wall motion abnormalities can occur if  删除换行 the myocardial inflammation is patchy in distribution. \n\n【17】Some other causes of acute left ventricular dysfunction also need to be  删除换行 considered. Low levels of serum electrolytes such as potassium, calcium and \n删除3：<u>Figure 15.1: ECG showing sinus tachycardia with ST segment elevation</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 15.2: ECHO showing hypokinesia  删除换行 of distal septum and apexCase 15 Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy 69</u>\n\n【18】Table 15.1: Synonyms of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy\n\n【19】•  Broken heart syndrome\n\n【20】•  Stress induced cardiomyopathy\n\n【21】•  Neurogenic myocardial stunning\n\n【22】•  Transient ventricular apical ballooning\n\n【23】Takotsubo cardiomyopathy  is a recently described entity also  删除换行 called the “broken heart syndrome”, neurogenic myocardial stunning or transient  删除换行 left ventricular apical ballooning. Takotsubo is a Japanese name given to a round删除8：<u>￾</u>bottomed narrow-necked fishing pot, used to trap an octopus. The shape of the  删除换行 left ventricle after apical ballooning, resembles this fishing pot. It occurs more  删除换行 often in postmenopausal, middle-aged women. Acute intense emotional stress  删除换行 is the usual triggering factor and the surge of catecholamines either causes  删除换行 microvascular vasospasm or direct myocyte injury. Additionally, release of free  删除换行 fatty acids by adrenalin induced lipolysis and hypokalemia due to an excess of  删除换行 cortisol, impair myocardial contractility. \n\n【24】These patients usually present with severe chest pain and clinical signs of  删除换行 left ventricular dysfunction. The ECG shows S-T segment elevation in multiple  删除换行 coronary artery territories and the biomarker of myocardial injury, the troponin-T \n\n【25】test, is generally positive. The ECHO shows wall motion abnormality of the  删除换行 left ventricular apex which does not conform to any particular coronary artery  删除换行 territory and typically spares the basal segments. Coronary angiography does not  删除换行 show any major occlusive lesion in most patients. \n\n【26】MANAGEMENT ISSUES \n\n【27】Before the clinical profile of this entity was clearly elucidated, many women  删除换行 with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy were probably managed as anxiety related  删除换行 panic attack or menopausal syndrome. Some were thought to have acute viral  删除换行 myocarditis while still others improved on their own while being investigated for  删除换行 thyroid hyperfunction and pheochromocytoma. When the patients present with  删除换行 chest pain, S-T segment elevation and positive troponin-T test, it is prudent to  删除换行 manage them as acute coronary syndrome. Aspirin, clopidogrel, beta-blocker  删除换行 and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) can all be instituted. An angiotensin  删除换行 converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with a diuretic can be added for heart failure  删除换行 management. Most patients make a rapid and event-free recovery, without any  删除换行 long-term disability or recurrence. \n\n【28】magnesium can impair myocardial contractility. Similarly, nutritional deficiency  删除换行 of vitamins and trace elements like thiamine, selenium and carnitine can also  删除换行 cause ventricular dysfunction. At times, thyroid storm and pheochromocytoma  删除换行 can present with left heart failure and should be ruled out by appropriate assays  删除换行 including serum thyroid hormone levels and urinary catecholamines. In our  删除换行 case, the left ventricular dysfunction was clearly related to psycho-social stress. \n\n【29】Therefore, the definite diagnosis is stress-induced cardiomyopathy which is also  删除换行 termed as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. 70 Section 4 The Cardiomyopathies\n\n【30】RECENT ADVANCES \n\n【31】Till a few years back, some stray case-reports of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy were  删除换行 published from Japan. With growing awareness about this entity, it is now being  删除换行 increasingly diagnosed across the globe. Recently carvedilol, a beta-blocker with  删除换行 additional alpha-blockade property, has been studied in a small cohort of cases  删除换行 and shown modest benefits.

She is not taking any prevention medications for migraine, is receiving counseling for anxiety but is not on any anxiolytics. She uses her albuterol inhaler as needed for her asthma. Three weeks ago she was started on minocycline for her acne. She has been doing well with her headache hygiene: drinking adequately, sleeping adequately, eating well and three meals a day, limiting screen time, and exercising routinely. She has tried ibuprofen 400 mg every 8 hours for 1 week with no relief. While she reports her typical migraine features of frontal head pain, photophobia, phonophobia, nausea and vertigo, she is now also complaining of seeing double and is bumping into walls when she attempts to walk. She has no fever or history of trauma. She has no history of recent acute illness. She has been going through a significant growth spurt and parents report an increase in appetite. She has gained 4.5–6.8 kg in the last 4–6 months.Past Medical History\n--------------------\n\n【5】She was full‐term to a 36‐year‐old gravida 3, para 2, miscarriage 1 mother via cesarean section due to fetal stress and prolonged labor. Her birthweight was 3.09 kg and her feeding, vision and hearing screening were normal, with no congenital anomalies, no cardiac concerns, and no infection or fever. She achieved developmental milestones on time and is doing very well on the honor roll at school. She is overweight with a body mass index (BMI) of 29.47; she is in the 95th percentile for weight and the 27th percentile for height.Past Surgical History\n---------------------\n\n【6】No overnight hospitalization or any surgeries.Family History\n--------------\n\n【7】No history of epilepsy, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis, autism, schizophrenia, Tourette syndrome, multiple sclerosis, or developmental delay. Positive family history for migraine in mother and maternal grandmother, kidney stones in paternal uncle, hypertension on paternal side of family, high cholesterol on maternal side of family, and stroke in maternal grandmother at age 65 years and in maternal aunt at 40 years. There is celiac disease noted in another maternal aunt and fibromyalgia in paternal aunt. Anxiety and depression are common on paternal side of the family and a maternal cousin was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.Current Status\n--------------\n\n【8】The patient is currently complaining of head pain (7/10 on numeric scale) with photophobia and phonophobia. She is nauseated and is having trouble walking because of diplopia. Her examination includes appropriate vital signs for her age. She is awake, alert and oriented, answering questions appropriately. Her pupils were equal, round and reactive to light. Her fundoscopic examination suggests cloudy disk margins and her finger‐to‐nose exercise is inaccurate. She moves all extremities with full range of motion; she has normal muscle bulk, strength and tone. Deep tendon reflexes are +3 in all extremities. She has difficulty with tandem walking and Romberg test. She follows a five‐step command but struggles with visual acuity. She is resting in an emergency room with the lights off. An intravenous catheter has been placed and normal saline is infusing at maintenance rates, she was given ondansetron 4 mg intravenously, and the neurology team has been consulted.\n\n【9】Neurology suggests an ophthalmologic consult with visual acuity testing, dilated fundoscopic examination, and optic nerve imaging. Bilateral papilledema is noted on examination, while visual acuity testing indicates visual field cuts in bilateral peripheral vision. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with and without contrast as well as magnetic resonance venography (MRV) is ordered. The imaging suggests a normally structured brain except for enlargement of the optic nerves suggesting papilledema. Neurology reviews the images and suggests a lumbar puncture for opening pressure, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for protein, glucose, white blood cell count, red blood cell count, viral panel, Lyme titer and an extra vial on hold for possible further testing.\n\n【10】Results of CSF analysis are shown in Table 53.1 and MRI brain scan in Figure 53.1 .

Based on the data, what are the differential diagnoses and the most likely diagnosis for this child?\n2.  What is the best way to treat this problem and how would you order this?\n3.  What other therapies would be recommended at this time?Rationale and Evidence‐based Practice Explanation\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】### Based on the data, what are the differential diagnoses and most likely diagnosis for this child?\n\n【17】The differential diagnoses include migraine with aura, pseudotumor cerebri syndrome (PTCS), Lyme meningitis, viral encephalitis, venous sinus thrombosis, and tumor. Lyme meningitis, viral encephalitis, tumor, and venous sinus thrombosis were excluded based on the results of laboratory testing, diagnostic testing, and focused clinical examination. Lyme meningitis would have been suspected if there was presence of an erythema migrans rash, headache lasting more than 7 days, CSF pleocytosis, or positive Lyme titer. The presentation for viral encephalitis would typically include other symptoms, including fever, ataxia, change in mental status, and possibly seizures. Also, she does not have MRI findings indicative of venous sinus thrombosis or tumor. She may have secondary migraine with aura; however, the primary cause for increased headache frequency is PTCS.\n\n【18】She is diagnosed with PTCS, which is caused by the rapid overproduction of CSF. Visual loss is a potential complication of this syndrome. The goal of treatment is preservation of vision and alleviation of symptoms. Visual field testing, dilated fundoscopic examination, and imaging of optic disks are necessary for proper diagnosis and should be included initially and at follow‐up examinations every 2–6 weeks. Pseudotumor cerebri most often occurs in women of childbearing years who have had significant weight gain. When the BMI is over 40, the severity of papilledema and visual loss rises significantly. The diagnosis of PTCS is made with the assistance of the modified Dandy criteria. These criteria include papilledema (and other signs of increased intraranial pressure), a normal neurologic examination (except possible cranial nerve VI palsy), normal neurologic imaging and CSF composition, and an opening lumbar puncture pressure greater than 28 cmH <sub>2 </sub> O for children.\n\n【19】### What is the best way to treat this problem and how would you order this?\n\n【20】Lumbar puncture is not only a diagnostic measure for PTCS but also a treatment for it. Normal opening pressure for an adult patient would be below 25 cmH <sub>2 </sub> O; however, some sedative agents can increase opening pressure and overweight patients can have a slightly elevated opening pressure by virtue of being overweight. In this case, the minocycline was stopped because PTCS can be a side effect of this medication. Initial treatment strategies should include weight reduction and a salt‐restricted diet. In many instances, acetazolamide is used as the first‐line pharmacologic therapy to reduce the risk of recurrence of PTCS. A slow titration of acetazolamide is recommended to reduce side effects. Alternates to acetazolamide include a trial of topiramate or a loop diuretic.\n\n【21】### What other therapies would be recommended at this time?\n\n【22】Reoccurrence of PTCS is commonly associated with weight gain so many patients are referred to a nutritionist, a psychologist and possibly a bariatric specialist for assistance. Studies have indicated that even a 5–10% weight loss significantly improved PTCS symptoms. Often children have other coexisting health problems that will need to be assessed and treated, including obstructive sleep apnea, anemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and fatty liver disease. In advanced cases, neurosurgical consult will be needed for possible ventricular shunt, stent or decompression.\n\n【23】Low‐pressure headache is often a side effect of a lumbar puncture and can be avoided by lying flat for a period of time and transitioning to increased activity slowly. Low‐pressure headaches are positional headaches that are decreased by lying flat but which are increased by sitting up or standing and can happen after a lumbar puncture.Case Resolution\n---------------\n\n【24】The patient was admitted to the hospital overnight while she recovered from the lumbar puncture, making sure she was lying flat for at least 4 hours and transitioning to sitting and standing positions slowly after this. Her headache resolved after the lumbar puncture. She was discharged to home the next day and started on acetazolamide 250 mg twice daily for 1 week and then increased to 500 mg twice daily for 4 months. Her minocycline was stopped and she was encouraged to increase activity and healthy food choices. The family was requested to monitor for side effects and monitor papilledema with ophthalmologic examination every 2 weeks to 2 months until resolved. If any symptoms occurred again (e.g. blurry vision, intractable headache or any other neurologic focal symptoms) they were advised to contact ophthalmology and neurology. Neurology will follow up monthly to monitor the acetazolamide treatment and for any signs of increased pressure.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 14:22:33", "endTime": "2024/09/12 14:23:00", "cost": 26.681}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:31", "update_time": "2024-09-11 22:23:00", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 22:22:33"}

Two wide-bore  删除换行 cannulae should be inserted and blood sent for full blood count, urea and electrolytes,  删除换行 clotting and crossmatch of 4 units, with further red cells, platelets or fresh-frozen plasma  删除换行 requested depending on further evaluation and blood results. Immediate intravenous fluid  删除换行 should be administered, usually colloid as volume expansion to maintain cardiac output.\n\n【21】The uterus should be rubbed suprapubically, and if this fails then bimanually, pending  删除换行 administration of 500 mg ergometrine and commencing a syntocinon infusion.

The woman should be monitored initially in a high-dependency setting  删除换行 until clinically and haematologically stable.\n\n【26】Although she is likely to have had a coagulopathy at admission, she is still at high risk of venous  删除换行 thromboembolism as she is probably septic, postpartum and has undergone anaesthetic. \n\n【27】Thromboembolic stockings and heparin should therefore be administered postoperatively.\n\n【28】Ultrasound scan\n\n【29】Ultrasound scan would not be indicated in this scenario.

She has some stiffness with typing but not first thing in the morning. She also reports pain in her right knee, which occasionally “locks up.” The right knee also hurts after long walks. On examination, her blood pressure is 130/85 mm Hg, heart rate 80 bpm, and weight 285 lb. Examination reveals only a nontender enlargement of her left distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint, and the right knee is noted to have crepitus and slightly decreased range of motion. There is no redness or swelling.\n\n【3】 What is your next step?\n\n【4】 What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【5】 What is the best initial treatment?\n\n【6】### ANSWERS TO CASE 56:\n\n【7】#### Osteoarthritis/Degenerative Joint Disease\n\n【8】Summary: The patient is a 56-year-old obese woman with complaints of activityrelated joint disease in the left DIP and right knee. There is no evidence of synovitis on examination.\n\n【9】 Next step: Obtain erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and plain x-rays of the hand and knee.\n\n【10】 Most likely diagnosis: Osteoarthritis (OA).\n\n【11】 Best initial treatment: Acetaminophen up to 4 g qd.\n\n【12】#### ANALYSIS\n\n【13】##### Objectives\n\n【14】1\\. Know the major clinical characteristics of OA.\n\n【15】2\\. Be familiar with management approaches to OA.\n\n【16】3\\. Understand the major classes of medications used for OA.\n\n【17】4\\. Know how to differentiate OA from inflammatory arthritis.\n\n【18】##### Considerations\n\n【19】This patient’s history and examination are characteristic of OA. Laboratory work, typically negative for inflammatory arthritis, and x-rays will confirm the diagnosis. The most important features are the gradual onset, the lack of active synovitis, and the fact that her symptoms worsen with activity. If there were evidence of inflammation or joint effusion, then the best next step would be to aspirate the fluid from the joint and send it for various studies, including Gram stain and culture to assess for infection, crystal analysis to assess for gout or pseudogout, and cell count to assess for inflammation.\n\n【20】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【21】#### Osteoarthritis\n\n【22】#### DEFINITIONS\n\n【23】BOUCHARD NODES: Bony enlargement of proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints, often asymptomatic.\n\n【24】CREPITUS: A creaking or hook and loop (Velcro)-like sound made by a joint in motion; typically not painful.\n\n【25】HEBERDEN NODES: Bony enlargement of DIP joints, often asymptomatic.\n\n【26】SYNOVITIS: Inflammation of the joint space characterized by redness, swelling, and tenderness to touch.\n\n【27】#### CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【28】OA is the most common joint disease in adults. The disease affects women more often than men. The incidence increases sharply in the fifth and sixth decades of life. OA begins insidiously, progresses slowly, and eventually may lead to disability, recurrent falls, inability to live independently, and significant morbidity.\n\n【29】Patients with OA often experience joint stiffness, which occurs with activity or after inactivity (“gel phenomena”) and lasts for less than 15 to 30 minutes. This is in contrast to the morning stiffness of patients with an inflammatory arthritis (eg, rheumatoid arthritis \\[RA\\]), which often lasts for 1 to 2 hours and often requires warming, such as soaking in a hot tub, to improve. Early in the disease, there are no obvious findings. There may be some crepitus (creaking sound) in the joint, and, unlike inflammatory arthritis, there is often no or minimal tissue swelling (except in the most advanced disease). Bony prominences, especially in the DIP/PIP joints, can occur later. Figure 22–1 shows a typical joint involvement in OA versus RA. Pain seen in OA typically can be reproduced with passive motion of the joint. Table 56–1 lists the patterns of typical joint involvement.\n删除4：<u>Table 56–1 • JOINT INVOLVEMENT IN OSTEOARTHRITIS</u>\n\n【30】Laboratory examination typically is unremarkable; inflammatory markers such as ESR, creatinine phosphokinase (CPK), and white blood cells (WBCs) all are normal. Likewise, autoimmune studies such as antinuclear antibody (ANA), rheumatoid factor, and complement levels also are normal. If the joint is aspirated, then examination of the synovial fluid also reflects a lack of inflammation: WBCs less than 2000/mm <sup>3 </sup> , protein less than 45 mg/dL without crystals, and glucose equal to serum. X-ray evaluation in OA may show osteophytes that are the most specific finding in the disease but might not be found early. Other characteristics seen on x-rays include joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, and subchondral cysts.\n\n【31】It is critical to differentiate OA from other conditions that may present similarly. Periarticular pain that is not reproduced with passive motion suggests bursitis or tendonitis. Prolonged pain lasting for more than 1 hour points toward an inflammatory arthritis. Intense inflammation suggests one of the microcrystalline diseases (gout/pseudogout) or infectious arthritis. Systemic constitutional symptoms, such as weight loss, fatigue, fever, anorexia, and malaise, indicate an underlying inflammatory condition, such as polymyalgia rheumatic, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or a malignancy, and generally demand aggressive evaluation.\n\n【32】##### Management\n\n【33】Education is critical. Encourage the patient to stay active, because not using the joint can cause further immobility. Multiple short periods of rest throughout the day are better than one large period. In patients with OA who are overweight, weight loss of even modest degree may produce improvement in lower extremity joint pain and function. Other methods of unloading an osteoarthritic joint include canes and walkers, which can reduce joint forces at the hip by as much as 50%.\n\n【34】Equipment such as canes and/or walkers are helpful for patients with advanced disease because these patients are less stable and, as a result, have frequent falls. Physical therapy in the form of heat applied to the affected joints in early disease often is helpful. Perhaps the most important intervention is having the patient maintain full/near-full range of motion with regular exercise. Physical therapy and exercise improve functional outcome and pain in OA by improving flexibility and by strengthening muscles that support the affected joints. Moist superficial heat can raise the threshold for pain, produce analgesia by acting on free nerve endings, and decrease muscle spasm. Ultrasound therapy appears to have no proven benefit. Superficial cooling decreases muscle spasm and increases the threshold of pain. Data concerning the efficacy of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) in patients with OA are conflicting.\n\n【35】Pharmacotherapy early in the course of the disease consists primarily of acetaminophen, the mainstay of therapy. It is well tolerated and as effective as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; both nonprescription and prescription strength).\n\n【36】The use of glucosamine and chondroitin for OA has been controversial, and results of randomized trials have varied. Most findings suggest that glucosamine and chondroitin have little benefit in patients with osteoarthritis. There appear to be few risks associated with their use, however, so patients who wish to try those remedies can be advised that they appear to be relatively safe.\n\n【37】NSAIDs inhibit the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX) in the prostaglandin catabolism pathway and work as either COX-1 or COX-2 inhibitors. For a long time, COX-1 NSAIDs were the most commonly prescribed drug for OA. However, COX-1 NSAIDs have well-documented side effects of gastrointestinal irritation and bleeding and renal damage. NSAIDs are effective pain relievers in patients with OA. The efficacy of acetaminophen has also been demonstrated to be superior to placebo in relief of pain due to OA, but is less effective than NSAIDs.\n\n【38】The COX-2 inhibitor class has the same anti-inflammatory potential, with fewer gastrointestinal side effects. Recent evidence about increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) events in patients using COX-2 inhibitors has led to the withdrawal of rofecoxib and valdecoxib from the market; however, the remaining members of the class should not be used in patients with known CV disease or multiple CV risk factors. The selective COX-2 inhibitors (eg, celecoxib and etoricoxib) appear to be as effective as the traditional nonspecific NSAIDs. Although they are associated with less gastroduodenal toxicity, concerns about an increased risk of cardiovascular adverse events has limited their use. Furthermore, the concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for an antithrombotic effect may negate the gastroduodenal-sparing effects of COX-2 inhibitors.\n\n【39】Oral steroids are generally not used to treat OA. Intra-articular steroids may be rarely useful for long-term treatment and can be helpful for the rare inflammation of a loose cartilage fragment, which may cause the joint to “lock up.”\n\n【40】Surgery is reserved for only the most severe cases, which include patients who have major instability, a loose body in the joint, intractable pain of advanced disease, or severe functional limitation. Joint replacement is the typical procedure.\n\n【41】###", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 14:36:17", "endTime": "2024/09/12 14:36:52", "cost": 35.124}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:31", "update_time": "2024-09-11 22:36:52", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 22:36:17"}

She has been treated by her pediatrician for atopic dermatitis (AD). The pediatrician has been treating the areas with topical hydrocortisone 2.5% cream, which has not helped control the symptoms. Her mother states that despite using generous emollients and hydrocortisone, the girl scratches rigorously at night and is unable to concentrate during school due to pruritus. She has a past medical history of moderate intermittent asthma and allergic rhinitis, and her mother reports a strong history of asthma on her side of the family without any dermatologic issues.

What is the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis?\n\n【5】ii. What are the ‘atopic stigmata’?\n\n【6】iii. What treatments are on the therapeutic ladder for atopic dermatitis?\n\n【7】Answer 1\n\n【8】i. Atopic dermatitis also commonly known as eczema, is a common chronic inflammatory disorder of the skin, with a prevalence of up to 30% in children and 10% in adults. Atopic dermatitis is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. There are two sets of genes that have been implicated: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> genes encoding epidermal proteins such as filaggrin ( FLG ) and serine protease inhibitor LETKI ( SPINK5 ) and 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> genes encoding immunologic proteins such as high-affinity IgE receptors ( FCER1A ), toll-like receptor-2 ( TLR-2 ) and different interleukins ( IL4, IL5, IL12B, IL13 ), among others. Ichthyosis vulgaris, which is an autosomal semidominant disorder of the skin caused by a mutation in FLG , is seen in up to 15% of patients with AD.\n\n【9】Due to genetic factors, patients with atopic dermatitis have an impaired epidermal barrier that is characterized by epidermal barrier dysfunction and increased transepidermal water loss as a result of an altered stratum corneum.\n\n【10】ii. Atopic stigmata are associated features observed in patients with atopic dermatitis. One of the most important cutaneous features observed in patients with atopic dermatitis is xerosis, characterized by dry skin with fine scale, often worse during the winter. Xerosis promotes pruritus, which can lead to inflammation through the release of proinflammatory cytokines by keratinocytes due to scratching.\n\n【11】Additional stigmata include palmar hyperlinearity, white dermatographism, periorbital darkening, pityriasis alba, infraorbital folds (Dennie–Morgan lines), hypodense lateral eyebrows (Hertoghe’s sign) and low hairline.\n\n【12】iii. Given the extent and areas of involvement, more potent topical steroids would be appropriate for this patient based on the therapeutic ladder for atopic dermatitis. Triamcinolone 0.1% is appropriate for use on most areas of the skin, excluding the skin folds and face, whereas thicker lichenified plaques can be treated with topical corticosteroids with high or very high potency such as fluocinonide or clobetasol, respectively. In addition to topical steroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus, pimecrolimus) have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of AD in prospective controlled trials. Adjunctive therapies include dilute bleach baths, oral antihistamines for antipruritic and sedative effects, cool mist room vaporizers and antibacterial soaps.\n\n【13】Other potential treatments include narrowband UV therapy, cyclosporine, azathioprine, methotrexate and mycophenolate mofetil.

Initially this was mild, but it has become progressively worse. She says that food  删除换行 seems to stick in the low retrosternal area. This applies to all types of solid food. She  删除换行 has lost 5 kg in weight over the last 2 months. Sometimes the difficulty with swallowing  删除换行 seems to improve during a meal. Recently she has had trouble with regurgitation and  删除换行 vomiting of recognizable food.\n\n【4】Three years ago her GP arranged for an outpatient upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, which  删除换行 was normal. She was reassured, but the problem has increased in severity. There is no other  删除换行 relevant medical history or family history. She lived in the north-western coast of the United \n\n【5】States for 4 years until 10 years ago. She works as a shop assistant.

Either chyle or  删除换行 lymph escapes depending on whether the obstruction is  删除换行 situated above or below the cisterna chyli. The chyle may  删除换行 come out with urine (chyluria) or faeces (chylous diarrhoea)  删除换行 or it may collect in different serous cavities of the body, such  删除换行 as the tunica vaginalis (chylocele), peritoneal cavity (chylous  删除换行 ascites), or pleural cavity (chylothorax).\n\n【18】Chyluria.— Obstruction to the thoracic duct will lead  删除换行 to dilatation of the lymph vessels draining into it. Lymphatics  删除换行 of the intestines and urinary tract will obviously be affected. \n\n【19】They become dilated and may rupture through the mucous  删除换行 membrane allowing the chyle to escape. If the neighbouring  删除换行 blood vessels also give way the chyle mixed with blood escapes\n\n【20】— haematochyluria. Escape of chyle with the urine is  删除换行 recognized by its milky appearance. The onset is usually  删除换行 sudden, following a muscular strain. There may be some  删除换行 constitutional disturbances along with the passage of chyle. \n\n【21】The condition lasts for a few days and passes off as suddenly  删除换行 as it came.\n\n【22】The urine coagulates on standing and separates into three  删除换行 layers, the fatty layer on the top, a pinkish layer at the bottom  删除换行 and the coagulated gelatinous layer in the middle.\n\n【23】Lymphuria.— This occurs when the obstruction is below  删除换行 the cisterna chyli, so that only lymph escapes when the  删除换行 lymph vessels are ruptured. The urine becomes thick and  删除换行 turbid. If the blood vessels are also ruptured, colour of the  删除换行 urine will obviously be pink.\n\n【24】Chylocele.— This term is applied to a collection of chy删除8：<u>￾</u>lous fluid in the  删除换行 tunica vaginalis.\n\n【25】The fluid may  删除换行 contain micro删除8：<u>￾</u>filaria.

Diagnosis can only be confirmed by  删除换行 aspirating milky fluid (cf. spermatocele).\n\n【27】SUBSEQUENT TREATMENT OF TERATOMA.—\n\n【28】(i) BLOOD EXAMINATION.—\n\n【29】(a) Detection of microfilariae in the film of the  删除换行 peripheral blood drawn at night.\n\n【30】(b) Eosinophilia is often present.\n\n【31】(ii) IMMUNOLOGICAL TEST e.g. complement fixation  删除换行 test and/or intradermal test.\n\n【32】(iii) Detection of microfilariae in the hydrocele fluid or  删除换行 in the exudate of lymph varix.\n\n【33】TREATMENT.— Treatment of filariasis is mainly  删除换行 medicinal. The medicines that are used are :\n\n【34】(i) The drugs such as Hetrazan or Banocide (diethyl删除8：<u>￾</u>carbamazine) are given at the dose of 100 mg thrice daily  删除换行 for 2 to 3 weeks.\n\n【35】(ii) Drugs e.g. para-melaminyl phenyl stibonate (MSb)  删除换行 act on infective larvi and immature adult worms. These drugs  删除换行 may be given.\n\n【36】(iii) A course of antibiotic to guard against secondary  删除换行 infection. Inj. omnamycin is quite successful in this regard.\n\n【37】SURGICAL TREATMENT.— Once fibrosis has given  删除换行 rise to deformities like elephantiasis, Ram's horn penis etc.  删除换行 surgical treatment is required.\n\n【38】Operation for elephantiasis scrotum.—-\n\n【39】Elephantiasis of the scrotum is mainly filarial. Non-filarial 删除换行 elephantiasis is occasionally seen in tropical as well as non删除8：<u>￾</u>tropical countries. It is usually due to fibrosis of lymphatic  删除换行 vessels from lymphogranuloma venereum. But elephantiasis  删除换行 from this cause never reaches a big size as seen in tropical  删除换行 elephantiasis.\n\n【40】(a) An elliptical incision is made on the scrotum as for  删除换行 the operation of a big hydrocele. The plane of cleavage  删除换行 between the scrotum and the parietal layer of the tunica  删除换行 vaginalis is carefully found out and dissection is carried out  删除换行 in this plane to cause as little haemorrhage as possible. The  删除换行 skin on the distal side of the incision is removed.\n\n【41】Bilateral eversion of sacs is performed for hydrocele. If  删除换行 the tunica vagina is grossly thickened, excision of sac should  删除换行 be performed. The remaining scrotal skin on the proximal  删除换行 side of the incision is sutured covering the testis.\n\n【42】This operation is only carried out when elephantiasis has  删除换行 affected the distal part of the scrotum, while the proximal  删除换行 part of the scrotum is relatively healthy with normal skin. \n\n【43】There is however chance of developing elephantiasis in the  删除换行 remaining scrotal skin.\n\n【44】(b) When the whole scrotum is affected with elephantiasis,  删除换行 an elliptical incision is made at the root of the scrotum and  删除换行 the whole of the skin of the scrotum is excised distal to the  删除换行 incision.\n\n【45】Hydrocele or chylocele is treated as described above. The  删除换行 testis on either side is accommodated in the subcutaneous  删除换行 tissue of the medial side of the corresponding thigh. The  删除换行 skin of the medial side of the thigh is mobilised to a  删除换行 considerable extent so that the skin flaps of the two sidesFILARIASIS IN SURGERY 249 删除换行 can be brought in the midline for suturing at the perineum. \n\n【46】Thus an artificial scrotum is formed.\n\n【47】Operation for elephantiasis scrotum with Rani's horn \n\n【48】A racket incision is made whose handle is a vertical  删除换行 midline incision along the dorsum of the penis and the blade  删除换行 of the racket extends from the upper end of this incision to  删除换行 encircle the root of the penis and the root of the scrotum.\n\n【49】The scrotal part is operated on first. The dissection is  删除换行 carried out along the plane of cleavage between the dartos  删除换行 muscle and the parietal layer of the tunica vaginalis. The  删除换行 whole of the scrotum is removed. Bilateral eversion of sac or 删除换行 excision of sac is performed.\n\n【50】The operation on penis is now started. A catheter or  删除换行 bougie is passed per urethra. The plane of cleavage lies  删除换行 between the skin of penis and the corpus spongiosum. The  删除换行 penile skin is excised upto the prepuce, which is kept intact. \n\n【51】Now the penis is completely decorticated.\n\n【52】The testes are implanted on the medial aspect of the  删除换行 corresponding thigh as mentioned above.\n\n【53】The decorticated penis is covered with skin graft. A few  删除换行 surgeons have utilised inside layer of the prepuce to cover  删除换行 the bare shaft of the penis.CHAPTER\n\n【54】INTERSTITIAL CELL TUMOURS\n\n【55】The penis is developed from a surface elevation, termed  删除换行 the genital tubercle, which appears at the cranial end of the  删除换行 cloacal membrane and lengthens to form the phallus. An  删除换行 entodermal plate, the urethral plate grows forwards from the  删除换行 walls of the cloaca and urogenital sinus towards the tip of  删除换行 the organ. The raised margins from both sides of the urethral  删除换行 plate form the 'genital folds or urethral folds. The phallus  删除换行 enlarges to form the penis and its apex constitutes the glans. \n\n【56】The genital folds fuse with each other from behind forwards  删除换行 enclosing the phallic portion of the urogenital sinus behind  删除换行 to form the bulb of the urethra and the greater part of the  删除换行 spongy urethra. So that the lining of the urethra is mainly,  删除换行 if not wholly, entodermal in origin. In this way as the phallus  删除换行 lengthens, the urogenital orifice is carried onwards until it  删除换行 reaches the glans.\n\n【57】While these changes are in progress, two genital swellings\n\n【58】(labioscrotal folds) have appeared on each side of the base of  删除换行 the phallus and extended caudally, separated from the genital  删除换行 folds by distinct grooves. The genital swellings meet each  删除换行 other ventral to the anus and unite to form the scrotum.\n\n【59】At the tip of the glans an ingrowth of surface epithelium  删除换行 occurs to meet the anterior end of the urethra plate. The  删除换行 disintegration of the cells of this ingrowth results in the  删除换行 formation of the terminal part of the urethra within the glans.\n\n【60】This part is ectodermal in origin and is drained by the  删除换行 lymphatics draining into the inguinal group of lymph nodes.\n\n【61】The prepuce begins to develop in the 3rd month at a  删除换行 time when the urethra still exhibits its primary orifice at the  删除换行 base of the glans. A ridge consisting of a mesodermal core  删除换行 covered by epithelium appears proximal to the neck of the  删除换行 penis and extends forwards over the glans. Deep to this ridge,  删除换行 there is solid lamella of epithelium which extends backwards  删除换行 to the base of the glans. As the urethral folds meet to form  删除换行 the terminal part of the urethra, the ventral horns of this  删除换行 ridge fuse to form the frenulum. Over the dorsum and sides  删除换行 of the glans, the epithelial lamina breaks down to form the 删除换行 prepucial sac and thus the prepuce becomes free from the  删除换行 surface of the glans. Thereafter the prepuce grows forward as  删除换行 a free fold of skin over the terminal part of the glans. The  删除换行 prepucial sac may not be complete until 6 to 12 months or 删除换行 more after birth. Presence of some connecting strands may  删除换行 still interfere with the retraction of the prepuce after birth.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【4】WBB IBB filariasis.

Non-filarial 删除换行 elephantiasis is occasionally seen in tropical as well as non删除8：<u>￾</u>tropical countries. It is usually due to fibrosis of lymphatic  删除换行 vessels from lymphogranuloma venereum. But elephantiasis  删除换行 from this cause never reaches a big size as seen in tropical  删除换行 elephantiasis.\n\n【40】(a) An elliptical incision is made on the scrotum as for  删除换行 the operation of a big hydrocele. The plane of cleavage  删除换行 between the scrotum and the parietal layer of the tunica  删除换行 vaginalis is carefully found out and dissection is carried out  删除换行 in this plane to cause as little haemorrhage as possible. The  删除换行 skin on the distal side of the incision is removed.\n\n【41】Bilateral eversion of sacs is performed for hydrocele. If  删除换行 the tunica vagina is grossly thickened, excision of sac should  删除换行 be performed. The remaining scrotal skin on the proximal  删除换行 side of the incision is sutured covering the testis.\n\n【42】This operation is only carried out when elephantiasis has  删除换行 affected the distal part of the scrotum, while the proximal  删除换行 part of the scrotum is relatively healthy with normal skin. \n\n【43】There is however chance of developing elephantiasis in the  删除换行 remaining scrotal skin.\n\n【44】(b) When the whole scrotum is affected with elephantiasis,  删除换行 an elliptical incision is made at the root of the scrotum and  删除换行 the whole of the skin of the scrotum is excised distal to the  删除换行 incision.\n\n【45】Hydrocele or chylocele is treated as described above. The  删除换行 testis on either side is accommodated in the subcutaneous  删除换行 tissue of the medial side of the corresponding thigh. The  删除换行 skin of the medial side of the thigh is mobilised to a  删除换行 considerable extent so that the skin flaps of the two sidesFILARIASIS IN SURGERY 249 删除换行 can be brought in the midline for suturing at the perineum. \n\n【46】Thus an artificial scrotum is formed.\n\n【47】Operation for elephantiasis scrotum with Rani's horn \n\n【48】A racket incision is made whose handle is a vertical  删除换行 midline incision along the dorsum of the penis and the blade  删除换行 of the racket extends from the upper end of this incision to  删除换行 encircle the root of the penis and the root of the scrotum.\n\n【49】The scrotal part is operated on first. The dissection is  删除换行 carried out along the plane of cleavage between the dartos  删除换行 muscle and the parietal layer of the tunica vaginalis. The  删除换行 whole of the scrotum is removed.

The plane of cleavage lies  删除换行 between the skin of penis and the corpus spongiosum. The  删除换行 penile skin is excised upto the prepuce, which is kept intact. \n\n【51】Now the penis is completely decorticated.\n\n【52】The testes are implanted on the medial aspect of the  删除换行 corresponding thigh as mentioned above.\n\n【53】The decorticated penis is covered with skin graft. A few  删除换行 surgeons have utilised inside layer of the prepuce to cover  删除换行 the bare shaft of the penis.CHAPTER\n\n【54】INTERSTITIAL CELL TUMOURS\n\n【55】The penis is developed from a surface elevation, termed  删除换行 the genital tubercle, which appears at the cranial end of the  删除换行 cloacal membrane and lengthens to form the phallus. An  删除换行 entodermal plate, the urethral plate grows forwards from the  删除换行 walls of the cloaca and urogenital sinus towards the tip of  删除换行 the organ. The raised margins from both sides of the urethral  删除换行 plate form the 'genital folds or urethral folds. The phallus  删除换行 enlarges to form the penis and its apex constitutes the glans. \n\n【56】The genital folds fuse with each other from behind forwards  删除换行 enclosing the phallic portion of the urogenital sinus behind  删除换行 to form the bulb of the urethra and the greater part of the  删除换行 spongy urethra. So that the lining of the urethra is mainly,  删除换行 if not wholly, entodermal in origin. In this way as the phallus  删除换行 lengthens, the urogenital orifice is carried onwards until it  删除换行 reaches the glans.\n\n【57】While these changes are in progress, two genital swellings\n\n【58】(labioscrotal folds) have appeared on each side of the base of  删除换行 the phallus and extended caudally, separated from the genital  删除换行 folds by distinct grooves. The genital swellings meet each  删除换行 other ventral to the anus and unite to form the scrotum.\n\n【59】At the tip of the glans an ingrowth of surface epithelium  删除换行 occurs to meet the anterior end of the urethra plate. The  删除换行 disintegration of the cells of this ingrowth results in the  删除换行 formation of the terminal part of the urethra within the glans.\n\n【60】This part is ectodermal in origin and is drained by the  删除换行 lymphatics draining into the inguinal group of lymph nodes.\n\n【61】The prepuce begins to develop in the 3rd month at a  删除换行 time when the urethra still exhibits its primary orifice at the  删除换行 base of the glans. A ridge consisting of a mesodermal core  删除换行 covered by epithelium appears proximal to the neck of the  删除换行 penis and extends forwards over the glans. Deep to this ridge,  删除换行 there is solid lamella of epithelium which extends backwards  删除换行 to the base of the glans. As the urethral folds meet to form  删除换行 the terminal part of the urethra, the ventral horns of this  删除换行 ridge fuse to form the frenulum. Over the dorsum and sides  删除换行 of the glans, the epithelial lamina breaks down to form the 删除换行 prepucial sac and thus the prepuce becomes free from the  删除换行 surface of the glans. Thereafter the prepuce grows forward as  删除换行 a free fold of skin over the terminal part of the glans. The  删除换行 prepucial sac may not be complete until 6 to 12 months or 删除换行 more after birth.

Very often the testis is atrophied due  删除换行 to pressure and lack of nutrition.\n\n<mark>【9】</mark>ELEPHANTIASIS OF THE PENIS.— The subcutane删除8：<u>￾</u>ous tissue of the penis is also affected along with the scro删除8：<u>￾</u>tum; rarely, the organ is separately involved. Sometimes the 删除换行 penis is enor删除8：<u>￾</u>mously thick删除8：<u>￾</u>ened and dis删除8：<u>￾</u>torted owing to  删除换行 unequal con删除8：<u>￾</u>traction of  删除换行 hypertrophied  删除换行 fibrous tissue  删除换行 and fascia  删除换行 around the pe删除8：<u>￾</u>nis. Such a dis删除8：<u>￾</u>torted and swol删除8：<u>￾</u>len organ is  删除换行 called the  删除换行 ‘Ram's horn’  删除换行 penis (Fig. \n\n【10】19.3) At other  删除换行 times, the penis  删除换行 becomes com删除8：<u>￾</u>pletely buried  删除换行 inside the scro删除8：<u>￾</u>tal mass, its ori删除8：<u>￾</u>fice is then indi删除8：<u>￾</u>cated by the  删除换行 hypertrophied  删除换行 prepuce (Fig. \n\n【11】19.2), whence a long channel goes upwards to meet the  删除换行 glans penis.\n\n【12】ELEPHANTIASIS OF THE LOWER LIMB.— The 删除换行 affection is commonly unilateral. The swelling is first noticed  删除换行 on the dorsum of the foot and subsequently it spreads upwards,  删除换行 usually as far as the knee and rarely up to the hip. As the  删除换行 swelling increases, the natural folds around the ankle become  删除换行 converted into prominent folds. As in the scrotum, warty  删除换行 growths appear on the surface of the skin. Similarly, infection  删除换行 by secondary organism is quite frequent in the filarial tissue.\n\n【13】ELEPHANTIASIS OF THE ARM, BREAST OR\n\n【14】VULVA.—These are rarely involved. Previous to the  删除换行 development of elephantiasis, there may be repeated attacks  删除换行 of lymphangitis as in the case of the scrotum or lower limb. \n\n【15】In the breast the thickening commences, as in the scrotum, at  删除换行 the most dependent part and proceeds upwards. The skin  删除换行 and subcutaneous tissue are hypertrophied but the glandular  删除换行 tissue of the breast remains unaffected. The skin cannot be  删除换行 picked up from the underlying tissue. It does not pit on  删除换行 pressure.\n删除3：<u>Fig. 19.3.— Shows a typical case of  删除换行 elephantiasis of the penis producing  删除换行 ‘Ram's horn’ penis.删除27：<u>248 A TEXTBOOK ON SURGICAL SHORT CASES</u></u>\n\n【16】'.X OBSTRUCTION AND RUPTURE OF \n\n【17】SUBSEQUENT TREATMENT OF SEMINOMA.—\nObstruction of lymph vessels leads to dilatation and when  删除换行 the tension becomes high, they give way. Either chyle or  删除换行 lymph escapes depending on whether the obstruction is  删除换行 situated above or below the cisterna chyli. The chyle may  删除换行 come out with urine (chyluria) or faeces (chylous diarrhoea)  删除换行 or it may collect in different serous cavities of the body, such  删除换行 as the tunica vaginalis (chylocele), peritoneal cavity (chylous  删除换行 ascites), or pleural cavity (chylothorax).\n\n【18】Chyluria.— Obstruction to the thoracic duct will lead  删除换行 to dilatation of the lymph vessels draining into it. Lymphatics  删除换行 of the intestines and urinary tract will obviously be affected. \n\n【19】They become dilated and may rupture through the mucous  删除换行 membrane allowing the chyle to escape. If the neighbouring  删除换行 blood vessels also give way the chyle mixed with blood escapes\n\n【20】— haematochyluria. Escape of chyle with the urine is  删除换行 recognized by its milky appearance. The onset is usually  删除换行 sudden, following a muscular strain. There may be some  删除换行 constitutional disturbances along with the passage of chyle. \n\n【21】The condition lasts for a few days and passes off as suddenly  删除换行 as it came.\n\n【22】The urine coagulates on standing and separates into three  删除换行 layers, the fatty layer on the top, a pinkish layer at the bottom  删除换行 and the coagulated gelatinous layer in the middle.\n\n【23】Lymphuria.— This occurs when the obstruction is below  删除换行 the cisterna chyli, so that only lymph escapes when the  删除换行 lymph vessels are ruptured. The urine becomes thick and  删除换行 turbid. If the blood vessels are also ruptured, colour of the  删除换行 urine will obviously be pink.\n\n【24】Chylocele.— This term is applied to a collection of chy删除8：<u>￾</u>lous fluid in the  删除换行 tunica vaginalis.\n\n【25】The fluid may  删除换行 contain micro删除8：<u>￾</u>filaria.

Diagnosis can only be confirmed by  删除换行 aspirating milky fluid (cf. spermatocele).\n\n【27】SUBSEQUENT TREATMENT OF TERATOMA.—\n\n【28】(i) BLOOD EXAMINATION.—\n\n【29】(a) Detection of microfilariae in the film of the  删除换行 peripheral blood drawn at night.\n\n【30】(b) Eosinophilia is often present.\n\n【31】(ii) IMMUNOLOGICAL TEST e.g. complement fixation  删除换行 test and/or intradermal test.\n\n【32】(iii) Detection of microfilariae in the hydrocele fluid or  删除换行 in the exudate of lymph varix.\n\n【33】TREATMENT.— Treatment of filariasis is mainly  删除换行 medicinal. The medicines that are used are :\n\n【34】(i) The drugs such as Hetrazan or Banocide (diethyl删除8：<u>￾</u>carbamazine) are given at the dose of 100 mg thrice daily  删除换行 for 2 to 3 weeks.\n\n【35】(ii) Drugs e.g. para-melaminyl phenyl stibonate (MSb)  删除换行 act on infective larvi and immature adult worms. These drugs  删除换行 may be given.\n\n【36】(iii) A course of antibiotic to guard against secondary  删除换行 infection. Inj. omnamycin is quite successful in this regard.\n\n【37】SURGICAL TREATMENT.— Once fibrosis has given  删除换行 rise to deformities like elephantiasis, Ram's horn penis etc.  删除换行 surgical treatment is required.\n\n【38】Operation for elephantiasis scrotum.—-\n\n【39】Elephantiasis of the scrotum is mainly filarial. Non-filarial 删除换行 elephantiasis is occasionally seen in tropical as well as non删除8：<u>￾</u>tropical countries. It is usually due to fibrosis of lymphatic  删除换行 vessels from lymphogranuloma venereum. But elephantiasis  删除换行 from this cause never reaches a big size as seen in tropical  删除换行 elephantiasis.\n\n【40】(a) An elliptical incision is made on the scrotum as for  删除换行 the operation of a big hydrocele. The plane of cleavage  删除换行 between the scrotum and the parietal layer of the tunica  删除换行 vaginalis is carefully found out and dissection is carried out  删除换行 in this plane to cause as little haemorrhage as possible. The  删除换行 skin on the distal side of the incision is removed.\n\n【41】Bilateral eversion of sacs is performed for hydrocele. If  删除换行 the tunica vagina is grossly thickened, excision of sac should  删除换行 be performed. The remaining scrotal skin on the proximal  删除换行 side of the incision is sutured covering the testis.\n\n【42】This operation is only carried out when elephantiasis has  删除换行 affected the distal part of the scrotum, while the proximal  删除换行 part of the scrotum is relatively healthy with normal skin. \n\n【43】There is however chance of developing elephantiasis in the  删除换行 remaining scrotal skin.\n\n【44】(b) When the whole scrotum is affected with elephantiasis,  删除换行 an elliptical incision is made at the root of the scrotum and  删除换行 the whole of the skin of the scrotum is excised distal to the  删除换行 incision.\n\n【45】Hydrocele or chylocele is treated as described above. The  删除换行 testis on either side is accommodated in the subcutaneous  删除换行 tissue of the medial side of the corresponding thigh. The  删除换行 skin of the medial side of the thigh is mobilised to a  删除换行 considerable extent so that the skin flaps of the two sidesFILARIASIS IN SURGERY 249 删除换行 can be brought in the midline for suturing at the perineum. \n\n【46】Thus an artificial scrotum is formed.\n\n【47】Operation for elephantiasis scrotum with Rani's horn \n\n【48】A racket incision is made whose handle is a vertical  删除换行 midline incision along the dorsum of the penis and the blade  删除换行 of the racket extends from the upper end of this incision to  删除换行 encircle the root of the penis and the root of the scrotum.\n\n【49】The scrotal part is operated on first. The dissection is  删除换行 carried out along the plane of cleavage between the dartos  删除换行 muscle and the parietal layer of the tunica vaginalis. The  删除换行 whole of the scrotum is removed. Bilateral eversion of sac or 删除换行 excision of sac is performed.\n\n【50】The operation on penis is now started. A catheter or  删除换行 bougie is passed per urethra. The plane of cleavage lies  删除换行 between the skin of penis and the corpus spongiosum. The  删除换行 penile skin is excised upto the prepuce, which is kept intact. \n\n【51】Now the penis is completely decorticated.\n\n【52】The testes are implanted on the medial aspect of the  删除换行 corresponding thigh as mentioned above.\n\n【53】The decorticated penis is covered with skin graft. A few  删除换行 surgeons have utilised inside layer of the prepuce to cover  删除换行 the bare shaft of the penis.CHAPTER\n\n【54】INTERSTITIAL CELL TUMOURS\n\n【55】The penis is developed from a surface elevation, termed  删除换行 the genital tubercle, which appears at the cranial end of the  删除换行 cloacal membrane and lengthens to form the phallus. An  删除换行 entodermal plate, the urethral plate grows forwards from the  删除换行 walls of the cloaca and urogenital sinus towards the tip of  删除换行 the organ. The raised margins from both sides of the urethral  删除换行 plate form the 'genital folds or urethral folds. The phallus  删除换行 enlarges to form the penis and its apex constitutes the glans. \n\n【56】The genital folds fuse with each other from behind forwards  删除换行 enclosing the phallic portion of the urogenital sinus behind  删除换行 to form the bulb of the urethra and the greater part of the  删除换行 spongy urethra. So that the lining of the urethra is mainly,  删除换行 if not wholly, entodermal in origin. In this way as the phallus  删除换行 lengthens, the urogenital orifice is carried onwards until it  删除换行 reaches the glans.\n\n【57】While these changes are in progress, two genital swellings\n\n【58】(labioscrotal folds) have appeared on each side of the base of  删除换行 the phallus and extended caudally, separated from the genital  删除换行 folds by distinct grooves. The genital swellings meet each  删除换行 other ventral to the anus and unite to form the scrotum.\n\n【59】At the tip of the glans an ingrowth of surface epithelium  删除换行 occurs to meet the anterior end of the urethra plate. The  删除换行 disintegration of the cells of this ingrowth results in the  删除换行 formation of the terminal part of the urethra within the glans.\n\n【60】This part is ectodermal in origin and is drained by the  删除换行 lymphatics draining into the inguinal group of lymph nodes.\n\n【61】The prepuce begins to develop in the 3rd month at a  删除换行 time when the urethra still exhibits its primary orifice at the  删除换行 base of the glans. A ridge consisting of a mesodermal core  删除换行 covered by epithelium appears proximal to the neck of the  删除换行 penis and extends forwards over the glans. Deep to this ridge,  删除换行 there is solid lamella of epithelium which extends backwards  删除换行 to the base of the glans. As the urethral folds meet to form  删除换行 the terminal part of the urethra, the ventral horns of this  删除换行 ridge fuse to form the frenulum. Over the dorsum and sides  删除换行 of the glans, the epithelial lamina breaks down to form the 删除换行 prepucial sac and thus the prepuce becomes free from the  删除换行 surface of the glans. Thereafter the prepuce grows forward as  删除换行 a free fold of skin over the terminal part of the glans. The  删除换行 prepucial sac may not be complete until 6 to 12 months or 删除换行 more after birth. Presence of some connecting strands may  删除换行 still interfere with the retraction of the prepuce after birth.", "index": 4652, "show": true, "start": 4600, "end": 4606, "province": ["格式规范性", "多余标点"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/09/12 14:07:35", "endTime": "2024/09/12 14:09:31", "cost": 116.199}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:30", "update_time": "2024-09-11 22:09:32", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 22:07:35"}

The Na is 145, the K is 4.5, the Cl is 111, and the bicarbonate is 18. How would you characterize the acidosis in this patient? High or low anion gap? What kind of problems might lead to a high-gap acidosis? What kind of problems would lead to a non-anion gap acidosis?\n\n【4】2.  2.\n\n【5】    You are asked to anesthetize a 5-year-old WF patient for renal transplant who is in end-stage renal failure. Her pH is 7.21. Why are renal failure patients acidotic?\n\n【6】Answers\n\n【7】1.  1.\n\n【8】    The anion gap is calculated by subtracting the sum of the serum anions from the sum of the serum cations as follows: (\\[Na <sup>+ </sup> \\] + \\[K <sup>+ </sup> \\]) – (\\[Cl <sup>− </sup> \\] + \\[HCO <sub>3 </sub> <sup>− </sup> \\]). The normal range is between 3 and 11. In this case, the anion gap is elevated which indicates there is an acidosis. Possible causes include lactic acidosis and diabetic ketoacidosis. Exogenous ingestion of acid such as methanol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, or aspirin could account for this. Endogenous (inborn errors of metabolism) leading to an acid load can also account for this. Hyperchloremia resulting in bicarbonate loss is the most common cause of a non-anion gap acidosis. This could be due to gastrointestinal loss or rental tubular acidosis—proximal or distal.\n\n【9】2.  2.\n\n【10】    If the renal damage affects glomeruli and tubules, the acidosis is a high anion gap acidosis. It is due to failure of adequate excretion of various acid anions due to the greatly reduced number of functioning nephrons. If the renal damage predominantly affects the tubules with minimal glomerular damage, a different type of acidosis may occur. This is RTA, characterized by a normal anion gap or hyperchloremic type of acidosis.\n删除16：<u>Further Reading\n\n【11】1.  1.\n\n【12】    Kitching AJ, Edge CJ.

Surgical Treatment.—\n\n【17】(a) Alongwith the previous conservative regimen,  删除换行 incompetent perforators and varicose veins may be treated  删除换行 by surgery or sclerotherapy following which the ulcer will  删除换行 heal completely.\n\n【18】(b) Larger ulcers will need a split skin graft after the  删除换行 veins have been treated.\n\n【19】(c) Ascending phlebogram must be performed at this  删除换行 stage if not performed earlier to detect incompetent calf  删除换行 perforating veins and evidence of damaged deep veins. \n\n【20】Normal phlebogram should arouse suspicion of other cause  删除换行 of ulceration as it is rarely produced by simple saphenous  删除换行 incompetence.\n\n【21】(d) Subfascial ligation of Cockett and Dodd.— Once  删除换行 the ulcer has healed the incompetent perforating veins should  删除换行 be identified and divided. An incision is made in the lower  删除换行 half of the leg 2.5 cm behind the posterior border of the  删除换行 tibia. The incision is deepened till the deep fascia is reached. \n\n【22】The margins are undermined. The deep fascia is incised along  删除换行 the line of incision. The margins of the deep fascia are lifted \n\n【23】up. The perforating veins are ligatured under direct vision  删除换行 and divided. It must be remembered that there can be little  删除换行 justification in doing extensive subfascial perforator ligation  删除换行 procedures. Instead where a perforating vein may be  删除换行 contributing significantly, accurate localisation using Duplex \n\n【24】Ultrasound Imaging followed by local ligation produces a  删除换行 very satisfactory result.\n\n【25】(e) Linton developed a radical surgical approach. In this  删除换行 technique the superficial varicosities were ligated and stripped  删除换行 with subfascial ligation of the perforating veins. Linton 删除换行 recommended ligation of the incompetent veins at their  删除换行 origins beneath the deep fascia. He described three long  删除换行 incisions down the leg •— medial, anterolateral and  删除换行 posterolateral for adequate exposure. The incisions are  删除换行 deepened and the deep fascia is also incised along the lines  删除换行 of skin incisions. The incised deep fascia is lifted and the  删除换行 perforating veins are ligated at their origins beneath the deep  删除换行 fascia. This operation was combined with ligation of the  删除换行 saphenous vein if they were incompetent. However this  删除换行 radical surgical approach could not produce a very satisfactory  删除换行 result. Subsequently Cockett described subfascial ligation  删除换行 of medial calf perforating veins which showed better result.\n\n【26】(f) A by-pass operation may be performed for thrombosed  删除换行 deep veins. Such occlusion is relieved before or at the same  删除换行 time that the incompetent perforators are ligated. The  删除换行 saphenous vein has been used to by-pass segmental venous  删除换行 occlusion of the iliofemoral or femoropopliteal vein. For  删除换行 iliofemoral occlusion, the contralateral saphenous vein is passed  删除换行 suprapubically and anastomosed to the affected side distal  删除换行 to the occlusion.\n\n【27】For femoropopliteal occlusion, the obstructed segment can  删除换行 be by-passed by anastomosis of the saphenous vein to the  删除换行 popliteal-tibial trunk below the occlusion at the level of the  删除换行 knee joint.\n\n【28】Better assessment of a case can be made by (i) isotope  删除换行 clearance technique perhaps combined with (ii) foot  删除换行 volumetric studies and (iii) Doppler assessment of reflux. At  删除换行 present, these techniques are being combined with ascending  删除换行 and descending phlebography. Based on these results by删除8：<u>￾</u>pass surgery, valvular repair, valvular insertion by-passes and  删除换行 artificial valvular transplantation can be selected and assessed.\n\n【29】(g) So far as local surgery to the ulcer is concerned, the  删除换行 last resort is excision and skin grafting. But now microvascular  删除换行 free skin flap transfer offers the prospect of bringing healthy  删除换行 tissue into the areas of severely damaged ulcerative area of  删除换行 skin.CHAPTER\n\n【30】RAYNAUD’S SYNDROME, BUERGER’S\n\n【31】DISEASE, THORACIC OUTLET 11", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【14】applied on the surface of ", "content": "【0】AETIOLOGY.—\n\n【1】A detailed history of development and progression of the  删除换行 leg ulceration must be taken.\n\n【2】The patient should be examined in a good light both  删除换行 standing and lying with both lower limbs completely exposed. \n\n【3】One must exclude ischaemic ulcer following arterial  删除换行 abnormality.

Long saphenous or short saphenous incom-petence in the presence of normal deep veins may benefit from surgery to correct venous abnormality in the leg and allow ulcer healing. Patients with refluxing deep veins would benefit from compression bandaging.\n\n【37】Is recurrence common?\n\n【38】The 5-year recurrence rate of healed venous ulcers is about 40%； it is about69% in non-compliant patients compared with 19% in patients wearing class 2 compression hosiery.\n\n【39】Are varicose veins in the absence of skin changes indicative of chronic venous insufficiency?\n\n【40】Varicose veins in the absence of skin changes are not indicative of chronic venous insufficiency. Chronic venous disease encompasses the full spec-trum of signs and symptoms associated with all the CEAP (clinical， aetio-logic， anatomical and pathophysiological classification； used to grade chronic venous disease) classes， whereas the term ‘chronic venous insuf-ficiency' is generally restricted to disease of greater severity (i.e. classes C4to C6).\n\n【41】The CEAP uses clinical signs in the affected legs to place the venous disease into seven classes， C0 to C6. Leg symptoms associated with chronic venous disease include aching， heaviness， a sensation of swelling and skin irritation； limbs categorized in any clinical class may be symptomatic (S) or asymptomatic (A).\n\n【42】What are the factors that influence venous pressure in the legs?\n\n【43】Pressure in the veins of the leg is determined by three components.\n\n【44】●Hydrostatic component related to the weight of the column of blood from the right atrium to the foot (during standing without skeletal muscle activity， venous pressures in the legs are determined by the hydrostatic component and capillary flow， and they may reach 80-90 mmHg)\n\n【45】Hydrodynamic component related to pressures generated by contractions of the skeletal muscles of the leg and the pressure in the capillary network (skeletal muscle contractions， as during ambulation，tran-siently increase pressure within the deep leg veins)\n\n【46】Venous valve component， if effective， ensures that venous blood flows toward the heart， thereby emptying the deep and superficial venous systems and reducing venous pressure， usually to <30 mmHg. Both hydrostatic and hydrodynamic effects are profoundly influenced by the action of the venous valves. Even very small leg movements can provide important pumping action. In the absence of competent valves， the decrease in venous pressure with leg movements is attenuated. If valves in the perforator veins are incompetent， the high pressures generated in the deep veins by calf muscle contraction can be transmitted to the superficial system and to the microcirculation in skin.\n\n【47】Note： The clinical signs of chronic venous disease probably reflect venous pressures in the leg reaching higher than normal values and remaining elevated for prolonged periods.\n\n【48】What are the causes of lower extremity ulcers?\n\n【49】● Cardiovascular disease\n\n【50】Diabetic nephropathy\n\n【51】Arterial insufficiency\n\n【52】Trauma\n\n【53】Vasculitis\n\n【54】Sickle cell anaemia\n\n【55】Malignancy infection\n\n【56】●Pyoderma ganagrenosum.\n\n【57】What factors are associated with poorly healing ulcers?●Large initial size (>20 cm)\n\n【58】Duration of time before compression treatment (>1 year)\n\n【59】Combined arterial insufficiencv\n\n【60】Poor improvement in first 4 weeks of compression treatment\n\n【61】Age\n\n【62】● Venous refill time on plethsymography of <20 s.\n\n【63】Further reading\n\n【64】Bergan JJ， Schmid-Schonbein GW， Coleridge Smith PD， et al： Mechanisms of disease： chronic venous disease， N Engl J Med 355：488-498， 2006.\n\n【65】London NJM， Donnelly R： ABC of arterial and venous disease： ulcerated lower limb， BMJ 320：1589-1591， 2000 (review).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "●Large initial size (>20 cm)", "content": "【0】187VENOUS ULCER\n\n【1】INSTRUCTION\n\n【2】Look at this patient's leg.\n\n【3】SALIENT FEATURES\n\n【4】History\n\n【5】Varicose veins； ask about duration\n\n【6】Past history of venous thromboembolism\n\n【7】Duration of ulceration and whether this is the first episode or recurrent\n\n【8】●Pain (lack of pain suggests neuropathic aetiology)\n\n【9】● Rheumatoid arthritis (remember up to half the patients with rheuma-toid arthritis have venous leg ulcers rather than the result of rheumatoid arthritis).\n\n【10】Examination\n\n【11】●1 Ulcer located on the medial aspect of leg (around the ankles) with pigmentation\n\n【12】Surroundingdermatitisandexcoriation1frompruritus ((stasis dermatitis)\n\n【13】● White atrophy with scars in the overlying skin\n\n【14】·The ulcer may be secondarily infected (cellulitis or thrombophlebitis)\n\n【15】● Look for varicose veins (The range of hip， knee and ankle movement should be determined\n\n【16】Sensation should be tested with a monofilament to exclude peripheral neuropathy (neuropathic arthritis or Charcot's joints， see p.496).\n\n【17】DIAGNOSIS\n\n【18】This patient has a venous ulcer (lesion) caused by varicose veins (aetiol-ogy)， which has caused severe pigmentation and dermatitis around the ankles (functional status).\n\n【19】ADVANCED-LEVEL QUESTIONS\n\n【20】What causes the surrounding pigmentation?\n\n【21】It results from extravasation of redbloodcellsSaandhaemosiderin deposition.\n\n【22】What causes the white atrophy (atrophie blanche)?\n\n【23】It results from hyalization of skin vessels， leading to scars in the overlying skin.\n\n【24】What is the pathogenesis of venous ulcer?\n\n【25】Disturbed venous flowpatterns and chronic inflammationprobably underlie all the clinical manifestations of the disease.\n\n【26】How is the diagnosis confirmed?\n\n【27】●When the diagnosis is in doubt， a punch biopsy from the border (not the base) of the lesion is helpful.\n\n【28】Color duplex scanning to define underlying venous abnormality： 60%of patients have normal deep veins with isolated superficial venous competence.\n\n【29】How would you manage such an ulcer?\n\n【30】●Reduction of venous hypertension and oedema.

(EPA 4，10)\n\n【19】Considerations\n\n【20】This 65-year-old woman with small-cell lung cancer presents in a stuporous state with hypotonic hyponatremia. She appears euvolemic， as she does not have find-ings suggestive of either volume overload (jugular venous distention or peripheral edema) or volume depletion (diminished skin turgor). Of note， the term volemia refers to intravascular volume. In this chapter， we use volemia to represent total body sodium (in this case， both variables are not coincident all the time). She has no focal neurologic deficits 0or1 apparent masses on CT scan of the brain suggestingcerebral metastases. The most likely cause of her altered mental status is hypona-tremia. The patient does not take medications. Thus， in the situation of hypotonic hyponatremia in a euvolemic state and with inappropriately concentrated urine， the most likely etiology is inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (ADH) produced by the lung cancer. Therapy is guided by the severity of the hyponatremia and the 删除换行 symptoms. Because this individual is stuporous and the sodium level is severely decreased， hypertonic saline is required with fairly rapid partial correction. This therapy is not benign and requires monitoring in the intensive care unit. Also， the goal is not correction of the sodium level to normal (135 mmol/L) but rather an increase in serum sodium concentration by 4 to 6 mmol/L in 24 hours.\n\n【21】DEFINITIONS\n\n【22】ANTIDIURETIC HORMONE： The posterior pituitary hormone that controls excretion of free water and thus， indirectly， sodium concentration and serum tonic-ity. Also referred to as arginine vasopressin.\n\n【23】OSMOLALITY： Concentration of osmotically active particles， which draw water into a compartment； the normal range for serum osmolality is 280 to 300 mOsm/kg.\n\n【24】SYNDROME OF INAPPROPRIATE SECRETION OF ANTIDIURETIC HORMONE： Nonphysiologic elevation of ADH levels as a consequence of ectopic production， as in malignancy， or stimulation of excess pituitary production by vari-ous pulmonary or central nervous system (CNS) diseases.\n\n【25】CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【26】Pathophysiology\n\n【27】Hyponatremia is defined as a serum sodium level <135 mmol/L and is， by far， the most common electrolyte disturbance among hospitalized patients. Patients are often asymptomatic， especially if the hyponatremia develops slowly. Depending on how rapidly the hyponatremia develops， most patients do not have symptoms until the serum sodium level is in the low 120 mmol/L range. Note： since sodium is a mon-ovalent cation， 1 mmol/L=1 mEq/L.\n\n【28】Serum sodium concentrations are important because they almost always reflect tonicity， the effect of extracellular fluid on cells that will cause the cells (eg， brain cells) to swell (hypotonicity) or to shrink (hypertonicity). For purposes of this dis-cussion， we use serum osmolality as an indicator of tonicity.\n\n【29】Hypotonic hyponatremia always occurs because there is water gain， that is， impairment of free water excretion. If one considers that the normal kidney capac-ity to excrete free water is approximately 18 to 20 L/d， it becomes apparent that it is very difficult to overwhelm this capacity solely through excessive water intake， as in psychogenic polydipsia. Therefore， when hyponatremia develops， the kidney is usually holding on to free water， either pathologically， as in SIADH， or physi-ologically， as an attempt to maintain effective circulating volume when patients are significantly volume depleted. Hyponatremia can also occur in cases of sodium loss， for example， as a consequence of diuretic use or because of aldosterone deficiency. However， in those cases， there is then a secondary gain of free water.\n\n【30】To determine the cause of the hypotonic hyponatremia， the health care provider must clinically assess the volume status of the patient by history and physical exami-nation. A useful algorithm for assessment of patients with hyponatremia is seen in Figure 47-1. Please note that the figure uses the term volemia. Though less com-monly used， the \"volume status\" we refer to is actually \"total body sodium. A more comfortable way to name the issue at stake is\"interstitial volume status.\n\n【31】A history of vomiting， diarrhea， or other losses， such as profuse sweating， sug-gests hypovolemia， as do flat neck veins， dry oral mucous membranes， and dimin-ished urine output. In cases of significant hypovolemia， there is a physiologic increase in ADH in an attempt to retain free water to maintain circulating volume， even at the expense of hypotonicity. In these cases， the excess ADH is not\"inap-propriate\"as in SIADH， but extremely appropriate. At this point， one can check the urinary sodium levels. In hypovolemia， the kidney should be avidly retaining sodium， so the urine sodium level should be less than 20 mmol/L. If the patient is hypovolemic， yet the urine sodium level is more than 20 mmol/L， then the kidneys do not have the ability to retain sodium normally. In this case， kidney function is impaired by the use of diuretics， the kidney is lacking necessary hormonal stimula-tion as in adrenal insufficiency， or there is a primary renal problem， such as tubular damage from acute tubular necrosis. When patients are hypovolemic， treatment of the hyponatremia requires correction of the volume status， usually replacement with isotonic (0.9%) saline.\n\n【32】Hypervolemia is usually apparent as edema or elevated jugular venous pressure. It commonly occurs as a result of heart failure， cirrhosis of the liver， or nephrotic syndrome. In these edematous disorders， there is usually a total body excess of both sodium and water， yet arterial baroreceptors perceive hypoperfusion or a decrease in intravascular volume， which leads to an increase in the level of ADH and，there-fore， retention of free water by the kidneys. Renal failure itself can lead to hypo-tonic hyponatremia because of an inability to excrete dilute urine. In any of these cases， the usual initial treatment of hyponatremia is administration of diuretics to reduce excess salt and water.\n\n【33】Thus， hypovolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia is often apparent clinically and often does not present a diagnostic challenge. Euvolemic hyponatremia， however， is a frequent problem that is not so easily diagnosed. Once the clinician has diagnosed the patient with euvolemic hypotonic hyponatremia， the next step is to measure the urine osmolality. This measurement is taken to determine whether the kidney is actually capable of excreting the free water normally (urine osmolality should be maximally dilute， <100 mOsm/kg) or whether the free water excretion is impaired (urine not maximally diluted， > 100 mOsm/kg). If the urine is maxi-mally diluted， it is handling free water normally， but its capacity for excretion has been overwhelmed， as in central polydipsia. More commonly， free water excretion is impaired， and the urine is not maximally diluted as it should be.\n\n【34】Two important diagnoses must be considered at this point： hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency. Thyroid hormone and cortisol both are permissive for free water excretion， so their deficiency causes water retention. Cortisol deficiency in second-ary (pituitary) adrenal insufficiency can mimic SIADH. In contrast， patients with primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease) may also lack aldosterone， so they\n\n【35】Cerebral salt-wasting\n删除3：<u>Figure 47-1. Assessment of hyponatremia.

However， as men-tioned， Addison disease and hypothyroidism should also be considered as potential causes of euvolemic hyponatremia (it should be noted that forms of Addison disease that impair both cortisol and aldosterone production will present with hypovole-mia， while those that affect only cortisol production will present with euvolemia).\n\n【37】Clinical Presentation\n\n【38】Nonphysiologic， nonosmotically mediated (therefore \"inappropriate\") secretion can occur in the setting of pulmonary disease， CNS disease， pain， in the postopera-tive period， or as part of a paraneoplastic syndrome. Because of retention of free water， patients actually have mild (although clinically insignificant) volume expan-sion. Additionally， if they have a normal dietary sodium intake， the kidneys do not retain sodium avidly. Therefore， modest natriuresis occurs so that the urine sodium level is elevated> 40 mmol/L.\n\n【39】SIADH is a diagnosis of exclusion： The patient must be hypoosmolar but euvolemic， with urine that is not maximally dilute (osmolality> 100 mOsm/L)， urine sodium more than 40 mmol/L， and normal adrenal and thyroid function. Some laboratory clues to SIADH are low blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and low uric acid levels.\n\n【40】The clinical manifestations are related to osmotic water shifts leading to cerebral edema； thus， the symptoms are mainly neurologic. Early symptoms include head-ache， nausea， and vomiting； later symptoms may progress to lethargy， confusion， seizures， or coma.\n\n【41】Treatment\n\n【42】Unless the patient has severe neurologic symptoms， the usual initial treatment of SIADH is free water restriction. Patients with severe neurologic symptoms， such as seizures or coma， require rapid partial correction of the sodium level. The treat-ment of choice is hypertonic (eg， 3%) saline. When there is concern that the saline infusion might cause volume overload， the infusion can be administered with a loop diuretic such as furosemide. The diuretic will cause the excretion of hypotonic urine that is essentially \"half-normal saline， so a greater portion of sodium than water will be retained， helping to correct the serum sodium level.\n\n【43】For patients with chronic hypervolemic hyponatremia， as in heart failure or cir-rhosis， vasopressin antagonists (tolvaptan and conivaptan are approved for use in the United States) are now available and are very effective in increasing free water excretion and raising serum sodium concentrations. Therapy with these agents is initiated in the hospital with close monitoring of sodium concentration.\n\n【44】Complications\n\n【45】When hyponatremia occurs for any reason， especially when it occurs slowly， the brain adapts to prevent cerebral edema. Solutes leave the intracellular compartment of the brain over hours to days， so patients may have few neurologic symptoms despite very low serum sodium levels. If the serum sodium level is corrected rapidly， the brain does not have time to readjust， and it may shrink rapidly as it loses fluid to 删除换行 the extracellular space. It is believed that this rapid shrinkage may trigger demyelin-ation of the cerebellar and pontine neurons. This osmotic demyelination syndrome may cause quadriplegia， pseudobulbar palsies， a\"locked-in\" syndrome， coma， or death. Demyelination can occur even when fluid restriction is the treatment used to correct the serum sodium level. For any patient with hyponatremia， the general rule is that chronic hyponatremia should be corrected slowly， and acutely developing hypona-tremia can be corrected more quickly. In chronic hyponatremia， the serum sodium concentration should be corrected no faster than 4 to 6 mEq/L in the first 24 hours.\n\n【46】CASE CORRELATION\n\n【47】●See also Case 18 (Hemoptysis/Lung Cancer)， Case 37 (Alzheimer Disease/Dementia)， Case 49 (Adrenal Insufficiency)， and Case 50 (Hypercalcemia/Multiple Myeloma).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 11:49:56", "endTime": "2024/09/12 11:50:37", "cost": 40.954}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:30", "update_time": "2024-09-11 19:50:37", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 19:49:56"}

The senior partner offers him a smoke, but the junior partner declines and takes his  删除换行 leave, saying that he does not approve of drug taking.\n\n【5】The junior partner is upset and worried and talks to his wife.

That is why you took the job. Cannabis  删除换行 is practically legalized in this country. Don’t rock the boat’.

His senior does not display any symptoms  删除换行 of depression or mental illness. He admits to smoking cannabis, but he says his usage is well  删除换行 controlled. He likes to smoke it on Fridays after a stressful week while practising his saxo删除8：<u>￾</u>phone in preparation for performing with his band in the weekend. He never smokes directly  删除换行 before performances as he needs to drive to the pubs where they play. The senior partner  删除换行 denies any alcohol problem or other illegal drug consumption.

Assessing if a fellow doctor is working safely is dif删除8：<u>￾</u>ficult. However, there are some indicators that could show if a colleague is in trouble:\n\n【11】• Punctuality: A colleague who displays erratic behaviour might be having a difficult  删除换行 time.\n\n【12】• Clinical records: Good information with justifiable management plans would affirm  删除换行 confidence in the doctor’s work.\n\n【13】• Prescribing: Do the partner’s prescribing patterns conform to the rest of the prac删除8：<u>￾</u>tice? There might be good reason if not, for example owing to a special clinical inter删除8：<u>￾</u>est. Conformity is reassuring, but no guarantee of good performance.\n\n【14】• Patients: Have you commonly had patients transferring to you after they have seen  删除换行 the other doctor and wondered why? This happens when you work with partners in  删除换行 a general practice, but if you see erratic management plans or ignored problems you  删除换行 might become suspicious.\n\n【15】• The primary care team: How do your team members find working with your col删除8：<u>￾</u>league? Have they been let down by him? The questions can be asked without reveal删除8：<u>￾</u>ing the cause for concern.\n\n【16】It is best to address the problem with the senior colleague directly and in a timely way. \n\n【17】Bypassing the doctor will make resolution of the problem much more difficult. If you are  删除换行 upset, it might help you to talk with a family member or a personal friend. You must trust,  删除换行 however, that they realize that this information is confidential. Being new to the organization  删除换行 might make it difficult to understand the practice history and ways of working. A colleague  删除换行 might be able to help. It is important to handle the situation sensitively as the reputation of  删除换行 everyone is at stake.\n\n【18】If you do have reasonable doubts about the doctor’s fitness to practise, you might want to  删除换行 discuss your partner anonymously with your defence union before involving any other out删除8：<u>￾</u>side parties. They will help you decide if patients’ care is at risk and if you need to inform  删除换行 others. Your local medical director and your local medical committee chairman are there to  删除换行 help. The General Medical Council is the licensing body for doctors and can investigate and  删除换行 remove unsafe doctors from its register.\n\n【19】It is your duty as a doctor to ensure patient safety. You are a partner in the surgery and you  删除换行 are responsible for its organization. It will not be easy to decide how covert or overt you  删除换行 must be in conducting your enquiries, how deeply to probe and deciding when you are satis删除8：<u>￾</u>fied enough to drop your suspicions. Nobody performs perfectly and everyone does make  删除换行 occasional errors of judgment. Clinical practice varies and every doctor practises medicine  删除换行 slightly differently. It is your decision whether to blow the whistle or not.\n\n【20】• Patient safety is your highest priority.\n\n【21】• As a doctor, you have to respond and intervene if you think a colleague is behav删除8：<u>￾</u>ing unprofessionally or does not perform to an acceptable standard.\n\n【22】• You have a duty to look after your colleagues.\n删除12：<u>Key Points145\n\n【23】Case 71: Rectal Bleeding</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【3】The colleague’s house is only one street away.

Assessing if a fellow doctor is working safely is dif删除8：<u>￾</u>ficult. However, there are some indicators that could show if a colleague is in trouble:\n\n【11】• Punctuality: A colleague who displays erratic behaviour might be having a difficult  删除换行 time.\n\n【12】• Clinical records: Good information with justifiable management plans would affirm  删除换行 confidence in the doctor’s work.\n\n【13】• Prescribing: Do the partner’s prescribing patterns conform to the rest of the prac删除8：<u>￾</u>tice? There might be good reason if not, for example owing to a special clinical inter删除8：<u>￾</u>est. Conformity is reassuring, but no guarantee of good performance.\n\n【14】• Patients: Have you commonly had patients transferring to you after they have seen  删除换行 the other doctor and wondered why? This happens when you work with partners in  删除换行 a general practice, but if you see erratic management plans or ignored problems you  删除换行 might become suspicious.\n\n【15】• The primary care team: How do your team members find working with your col删除8：<u>￾</u>league? Have they been let down by him? The questions can be asked without reveal删除8：<u>￾</u>ing the cause for concern.\n\n【16】It is best to address the problem with the senior colleague directly and in a timely way. \n\n【17】Bypassing the doctor will make resolution of the problem much more difficult. If you are  删除换行 upset, it might help you to talk with a family member or a personal friend. You must trust,  删除换行 however, that they realize that this information is confidential. Being new to the organization  删除换行 might make it difficult to understand the practice history and ways of working. A colleague  删除换行 might be able to help. It is important to handle the situation sensitively as the reputation of  删除换行 everyone is at stake.\n\n【18】If you do have reasonable doubts about the doctor’s fitness to practise, you might want to  删除换行 discuss your partner anonymously with your defence union before involving any other out删除8：<u>￾</u>side parties. They will help you decide if patients’ care is at risk and if you need to inform  删除换行 others. Your local medical director and your local medical committee chairman are there to  删除换行 help. The General Medical Council is the licensing body for doctors and can investigate and  删除换行 remove unsafe doctors from its register.\n\n【19】It is your duty as a doctor to ensure patient safety. You are a partner in the surgery and you  删除换行 are responsible for its organization. It will not be easy to decide how covert or overt you  删除换行 must be in conducting your enquiries, how deeply to probe and deciding when you are satis删除8：<u>￾</u>fied enough to drop your suspicions. Nobody performs perfectly and everyone does make  删除换行 occasional errors of judgment. Clinical practice varies and every doctor practises medicine  删除换行 slightly differently. It is your decision whether to blow the whistle or not.\n\n【20】• Patient safety is your highest priority.\n\n【21】• As a doctor, you have to respond and intervene if you think a colleague is behav删除8：<u>￾</u>ing unprofessionally or does not perform to an acceptable standard.\n\n【22】• You have a duty to look after your colleagues.\n删除12：<u>Key Points145\n\n【23】Case 71: Rectal Bleeding</u>", "index": 339, "show": true, "start": 339, "end": 894, "province": ["格式规范性", "多余换行"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/09/12 13:48:24", "endTime": "2024/09/12 13:49:03", "cost": 38.26}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:30", "update_time": "2024-09-11 21:49:03", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 21:48:24"}

Phototherapy for the Pediatric Population\n=============================================\n\n【3】John Koo <sup>1 <span class=\"ContactIcon\"></span></sup> and Mio Nakamura <sup>1</sup>\n\n【4】通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>\n\n【5】Psoriasis and Skin Treatment Center, Department of Dermatology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA\n\n【6】Case\n----\n\n【7】An 8-year-old female presents with atopic dermatitis since infancy. She presents with her mother who states that she has tried various topical corticosteroids and topical non-corticosteroids without relief. The child has severe itching that keeps her awake at night. She just started second grade, and it is apparent to the mother and her teacher that she is having an increasingly difficult time staying focused and awake in school as she is either scratching or falling asleep. Her mother would like her skin to improve so that she does not fall behind in school because, despite her atopic dermatitis, she has been doing very well in school so far. The child is otherwise healthy aside from mild asthma and has reached her developmental milestones to date. On examination, she is actively scratching but is overall attentive and conversational with you and the mother. She has scattered erythematous, excoriated papules and lichenified plaques on the posterior neck and in the bilateral antecubital and popliteal fossae. Her face is also affected with erythematous, xerotic patches on the bilateral cheeks. Her trunk and extremities appear mildly erythematous and xerotic diffusely.\n\n【8】Given that the child generally appears to be well behaved and the mother is very supportive and reliable, you discuss the possibility of starting phototherapy and its risks and benefits. The mother is agreeable 2 to 3 times per week commitments to bringing the child in for phototherapy treatments after school. The mother is also confident that her child can listen and follow all directions by the phototherapy nurses and doctors and understands that this is absolutely crucial to ensure safe treatments. The decision is made to start the patient on NB-UVB phototherapy twice weekly.\n\n【9】Before receiving the first treatment, the patient and her mother undergo an orientation session where the nurse gives full explanations of what to expect during each treatment session in a way that the child can understand. The patient is shown where to change into a gown. Then the nurse introduces the phototherapy booth and demonstrates how she steps into the box. Once she is standing in the booth, the nurse will ask if she is ready, and if she is, she will close the doors. She will then remove the gown and stand inside the booth very still. She must also wear eye goggles, and the goggles must stay on at all times while in the booth. Once she is ready, the nurse will count down “3…2…1”. After “1”, the lights will turn on inside the booth and it will make a loud whirling noise. The nurse will always tell the child how many seconds this will last for, and that they can count together up to that number, and when they get to the number, the lights will turn off. At that point, she can get dressed. Once she is ready, the door will open. The child is reassured that her mother is always outside the booth, and if she gets scared, she can always says so and her mother and the nurse can both hear her.\n\n【10】For the first session, given the patient is skin type II and there is a large amount of visible inflammation on the skin, the starting dose is decided to be very low, and only 6 sec of light administration is required. Although the child appears apprehensive at first, with the support of the mother and the nurse, she is able to step into the light booth, count to 6, and complete the treatment as instructed.\n\n【11】The patient and her mother return for follow up 4 weeks later with already some improvement of her atopic dermatitis. She has less itching and is sleeping and paying attention better in school. The patient reports to you that she is up to one whole minute in the booth and she doesn’t even get scared anymore.\n\n【12】Discussion\n----------\n\n【13】Treatment of inflammatory skin conditions such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and vitiligo can be difficult for the pediatric patient. Many therapies available to adult patients are not FDA-approved for use in the pediatric population, especially systemic medications. Many systemic medications have not been officially tested in children, and therefore, possible risks such as organ toxicity and effects on proper development into adulthood are common concerns. On the other hand, when the patient has severe or generalized disease, relying only on large amounts of topical medications is also a concern, for example, due to local effects such as skin atrophy or striae formation and internal effects such as systemic absorption and adrenal suppression with topical steroids. Therefore, phototherapy is often a good second-line treatment option.\n\n【14】Unfortunately, randomized controlled trial data comparing the efficacy and safety of various phototherapy modalities against each other and against other standards of treatment is lacking. However, the current data suggest that phototherapy is an effective treatment for children and should be a therapeutic option when disease is widespread or refractory to topical therapies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Currently, most of the available reports regarding pediatric phototherapy are based on psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and vitiligo using, most commonly, NB-UVB, followed by PUVA, BB-UVB, and excimer laser. For all of these conditions, phototherapy is effective in inducing improvement in the majority of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 – 7 \\]</u>. Goeckerman therapy is another option for pediatric patients, especially in the summer months when children are off of school. This day treatment therapy, consisting of phototherapy and topical tar, is extremely safe and effective in pediatric patients .\n\n【15】However, long-term safety data of phototherapy and photochemotherapy in children is lacking. Photoaging is a well-known side effect of phototherapy, but its relevance for children has not been established 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Risk of skin cancer in the pediatric population is also unknown. Although studies in adult patients have not shown a clear increased risk of skin cancer with use of UVB phototherapy, pediatric patients have a longer time period compared to adults in which skin cancers can arise following phototherapy. Furthermore, PUVA treatments should be used with caution in pediatric patients as studies in adult patients have shown that more than 250 treatments can lead to increased risk of skin cancer in Caucasian patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】Another disadvantage to phototherapy is the time commitment required on the part of both the child’s and the accompanying guardian’s schedules. Appointments scheduled in the early mornings or late in the day will help to avoid school absences. To promote treatment adherence, patients and guardians must be carefully counseled before therapy on the duration and expectations of therapy. In general, for psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, treatments are held 2 to 3 times per week and significant improvement is expected in responders after 20–30 treatments. In many patients, ongoing maintenance with once weekly treatment session is required 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Finally, it is important to assess pediatric patients in terms of their maturity when attempting to decide whether or not phototherapy is a valid option. It is unsafe to treat patients who are not able to follow directions, such as standing still or keeping eye protection on during treatments. The nurse or other staff members who administer phototherapy should periodically check through the window in the phototherapy booth to verify that patients are complying with these measures. If the child is fearful of being inside the phototherapy booth alone, there are ways to make phototherapy “fun”. In addition to the counting technique as outlined in the current case, singing a song or playing music during treatments can be helpful. The child can also bring toys such as stuffed animals into the booth, provided that patient is not actively playing with the toy or the toy is preventing proper light penetrance to the skin. Despite these measures, if the patient is still apprehensive or the guardian and/or provider are uncomfortable with the patient being in the booth alone, the guardian can accompany the patient inside the booth. The accompanying person should cover their skin from light and should be positioned to minimize blocking of light to large areas of affected skin.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 14:10:43", "endTime": "2024/09/12 14:11:00", "cost": 17.367}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:30", "update_time": "2024-09-11 22:11:01", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 22:10:43"}

The history provided describes a noncontact injury to the knee during an acceleration-deceleration/pivoting move with the patient experiencing a feel-ing of giving way in his knee. The player quickly accumulates a knee effusion and has significant pain. These findings are characteristic descriptions of an ACL injury. The Lachman test is diagnostic for this injury， and an MRI would confirm the diagnosis.\n\n【26】22.2B. Skiing， along with soccer， is strongly associated with ACL injury. The patient presents after a crash with an effusion and inability to bear weight. Knee radiographs demonstrate a lateral capsular avulsion fracture (Segond fracture). This is pathognomonic for an ACL injury. The Lachman test， per-formed by translating the tibia anteriorly with the knee in 30 degrees of flex-ion and assessing for a firm end point， is highly sensitive for an ACL injury.\n\n【27】22.3E. When treating a patient with an ACL-deficient knee nonoperatively， reha-bilitation should consist of aggressive hamstring strengthening.\n\n【28】22.4 C. The ACL is the primary restraint to anterior translation of the tibia with respect to the femur. It consists of 2 bundles， the anteromedial and posterolat-eral bundles. The anteromedial is the largest of the 2 bundles and functions as the primary restraint to anterior translation in the mid-ranges of knee flexion.\n\n【29】CLINICAL PEARLS\n\n【30】The ACL originates from the medial wall of the lateral femoral condyle and travels obliquely， inserting on the tibia just anterior to and between the intercondylar eminences of the tibia.\n\n【31】The primary role of the ACL is restraining anterior translation of the tibia with respect to the femur. It is a secondary restraint to tibial rotation.\n\n【32】ACL tears are caused by noncontact pivoting injuries with the foot firmly planted on the ground. They are commonly seen in soccer players and skiers.\n\n【33】Nonoperative treatment is typically reserved for older， sedentary patients and is based on a rehabilitation protocol encouraging aggressive hamstring strengthening， bracing， and activity modifications.\n\n【34】The goal of ACL reconstruction is restoration of normal knee kinematics.删除17：<u>卜</u>AACL reconstruction is the treatment of choice for young， active patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 14:12:17", "endTime": "2024/09/12 14:12:32", "cost": 15}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:30", "update_time": "2024-09-11 22:12:31", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 22:12:16"}

It is easily administered as a series of multiple injections.\n\n【5】E. It can be given to young children with other scheduled immunizations.\n\n【6】Answer: 34.1 C. The oral polio vaccine or “live” vaccine produces not only IgM and IgG antibodies in the blood but also secretory IgA antibodies in the intestine, resulting in intestinal immunity. The inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine produces humoral immunity, not localized intestinal immunity.\n\n【7】Answers A, B, D, and E are incorrect. Only the inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine is administered to immunocompromised patients. The OPV has been associated with transfer of live poliovirus to close contacts of immunized patients; therefore, use of the IPV is currently recommended in the United States for childhood immunizations. It is easily administered in multiple oral doses, not injections. Both the OPV and the IPV can be given to young children with other scheduled immunizations.\n\n【8】Question: 34.2 The primary pathologic effect of polio viral infection is a result of which of the following?\n\n【9】A.

Polioviruses are cytolytic and cause direct damage to infected cells. Answers B, C, D, and E are incorrect. Paralysis results in fewer than 2% of patients who are infected with poliovirus, and it is a direct result of the destruction of infected neurons in the spinal cord and brain. Paralytic disease is caused by cytolytic damage because of the virus, not by the immune response. Aseptic meningitis is a result of poliovirus infection that occurs in less than 1% to 2% of patients infected and is a result of the destruction of infected cells. If it is not contained by the host antibody response, poliovirus infection may result in “minor” and “major” viremic spread within the patient; however, the primary pathologic effect of poliovirus is still the cell lysis of infected cells.\n\n【15】Question: 34.3 The majority of nonimmunized patients infected with poliovirus would be expected to experience which of the following symptoms?\n\n【16】A.

The client had not observed her eating or drinking during this period and reported that the ferret has been sleeping more than usual. The owner did observe that although her stool production was less than normal, it appeared dark. During the past year, the ferret has been given oral melatonin for suspected adrenal disease. The ferret was normally fed a diet of kibbled ferret food.﻿\n\n【6】Physical Examination Findings\n\n【7】The ferret was thin (body score of 3/9) and weighed 500 g. She was lethargic and at least 10% dehydrated. She was weak and reluctant to move. Her body temperature was 98°F and she had tachypnea. Black tarry stools were found adherent to the hair around the anus. A large ulcer was found during examination of the oral cavity. See Figures 3.1 and 3.2 and Tables 3.1 and 3.2 .﻿\n\n【8】Other Diagnostic Findings\n\n【9】A radiographic evaluation of the ferret  indicated a diffuse, unstructured interstitial to alveolarpat-tern in the caudal dorsal lungs. Because the radiographs were not centered over the thorax, specific thoracic radiographs were recommended for further evaluation. The cardiac silhouette appears to be within normal limits and the pulmonary vasculature appears to be within normal limits. The serosal detail of the abdomen is poor. There is very little falciform fat (back fat), suggesting an overly thin animal. What can be visualized in the abdomen appears to be otherwise normal. On the lateral image, the abdomen appears mildly pendulous. There is a large spleen, although this is typical for a ferret; however, splenomegaly cannot be entirely ruled out. The findings of the thorax and lungs could be indicative of hematogenous pneumonia in the caudal dorsal lungs. Alternatively, diffuse neoplasia cannot be entirely ruled out. Repeat imaging with computed radiography would be recommended to try to further evaluate these caudal dorsal lung lobes. The appearance of the loss of serosal detail in the abdomen could be the result of poor body condition score, although peritoneal effusion or carci-nomatosis cannot be entirely ruled out. The remainder of the abdomen is unremarkable. An ultrasound examination was recommended, but declined by the client owing to the cost of the procedure.﻿\n\n【10】Interpretive Discussion\n删除3：<u>Figure 3.2a shows a marked number of polychro-matophilic erythrocytes and echinocytes.

In this case, the ferret has a marked regenerative anemia based on the marked poly-chromasia on the blood film, presence of nucleated erythrocytes, and marked number of reticulocytes. The cause of the anemia is likely to be associated with blood loss as indicated by the low total protein and a low platelet count that indicates excessive consumption of platelets. The blood loss is likely from gastrointestinal hemorrhage as indicated by the presence of melena on the physical examination.\n删除3：<u>Fig. 3.1 .

Plasma biochemical results.\n</u>\nNeutrophil concentrations are generally higher than lymphocyte concentrations in normal ferrets and they tend to increase in concentration, while lymphocytes decrease in concentration with increasing age. The total leukocyte count of healthy ferrets can be as low as 3,000/|xL; therefore, ferrets are unable to develop a marked leukocytosis with inflammatory disease, and concentrations greater than 20,000/|xL are unusual and a left shift is rare. In this case, the ferret has a leukopenia with slightly toxic neutrophils and a left shift indicative of a degenerative left shift. She has also a severe lymphopenia.\n\n【12】The increased serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) concentration can be associated with dehydration, renal failure, or gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The nonexistent creatinine supports the idea of gastrointestinal hemorrhage; however, one must consider that in normal and azotemic ferrets, the plasma creatinine concentration is lower than that in dogs and cats. The mean plasma crea–tinine concentration of healthy ferrets is 0.4-0.6 mg/dL with a range of 0.2-0.9 mg/dL. As a result, a moderate increase in the plasma creatinine concentration (i.e. 1-2 mg/dL) in a ferret is significant and suggestive of renal disease. This, however, is not an issue in this case.\n\n【13】Evaluation of the liver in ferrets by laboratory testing is the same as that for those in dogs and cats. The plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity, which appears elevated in this case, is a sensitive and specific test for hepatocellular disease in ferrets. Ferrets with hepatocellular disease commonly have increased aspar-tate aminotransferase (AST) activity as well. Those with cholestasis likely have increased plasma alkaline phos-phatase and 7 -glutamyl transferase (GGT) activities. Ferrets rarely become icteric or have plasma bilirubin concentrations greater than 2.0 mg/dL, even when hep-atobiliary disease is severe. In this case, the ferret likely has hepatocellular disease.\n\n【14】The causes of hypoproteinemia in ferrets are the same as those in dogs and cats. In this case, it is likely associated with significant blood loss from gastrointestinal hemorrhage.\n\n【15】The prognosis for survival in this ferret based on the physical examination, hemogram, and plasma biochemical profile is poor.\n删除3：<u>Fig. 3.3 .

She  删除换行 landed on her shoulder. Immediately she complained of severe pain and suspected her  删除换行 shoulder was starting to swell. She has been taken to the local emergency department,  删除换行 where she continues to complain of severe pain in her right shoulder. She has a past  删除换行 medical history of hypertension treated with bendroflumethiazide, but has been otherwise  删除换行 well.\n\n【3】Examination\n\n【4】There is a large bruise and swelling over the right shoulder, extending down to the proxi删除8：<u>￾</u>mal one-third of the humerus, as well as tenderness to palpation over the right shoulder  删除换行 girdle. She can hardly move her right arm because of the pain. There is no neurovascular  删除换行 deficit. Radiographs are shown in Figs 7.1and 7.2.\n\n【5】删除3：<u>Figure 7.1 Figure 7.2 </u>\n\n【6】Questions\n\n【7】• What is the diagnosis?\n\n【8】• Describe the relevant anatomy.\n\n【9】• How would you manage this patient?删除5：<u>22</u>\n删除7：<u>100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology</u>\nANSWER 7\n\n【10】This is a fracture of the proximal humerus. The X-rays show displacement of the greater  删除换行 tuberosity and the surgical neck of humerus. The humeral head is not dislocated. This is  删除换行 a typical fracture pattern in an elderly woman with osteoporosis. Swelling and tenderness  删除换行 to palpation are typically present. Bruising extending along the arm distally and along  删除换行 the chest wall is often present a few days following injury.\n\n【11】The proximal humerus consists of four bony parts: humeral head (articular surface),  删除换行 greater tuberosity, lesser tuberosity and the humeral diaphysis. Radiographs should  删除换行 include anteroposterior, lateral and axillary views, and often a CT reconstruction scan to  删除换行 assess the fragments involved.\n\n【12】Fracture stability can be assessed by placing one hand on the humeral head while gently  删除换行 rotating the humeral shaft internally and externally. If the proximal and distal fragments  删除换行 move as a unit, the fracture is considered stable.\n\n【13】A neurovascular examination is essential owing to the proximity of the brachial plexus  删除换行 and axillary artery. The incidence of neurovascular injury is increased in fracture disloca删除8：<u>￾</u>tions. The axillary nerve is most commonly injured.\n\n【14】Indications for open or closed reduction and internal fixation are related to the fracture  删除换行 pattern, the quality of the bone, the status of the rotator cuff, and the age and activity  删除换行 level of the patient. The goal of reduction and fixation of a proximal humeral fracture  删除换行 is to obtain nearly anatomical reduction and stable fixation to allow an early range of  删除换行 motion. Undisplaced fractures are treated conservatively.\n\n【15】Most of the displaced one- or two-part fractures are treated with closed reduction and  删除换行 pin fixation or open reduction and internal fixation. The treatment options for three删除8：<u>￾</u>part proximal humerus fractures include proximal humeral plate and screws or proximal  删除换行 humeral intramedullary nail. The preferred treatment of four-part fractures is humeral  删除换行 head replacement if fixation with a plate and screws is not possible. This is primarily  删除换行 because of the high risk of osteonecrosis and secondarily because of the difficulty in  删除换行 obtaining secure internal fixation.\n\n【16】KEY POINTS\n\n【17】• The incidence of neurovascular injury is increased in fracture dislocations of the  删除换行 proximal humerus.\n\n【18】• The axillary nerve is most commonly injured.\n\n【19】• Blood supply to the humerus is predominantly via the anterior humeral circumflex  删除换行 artery.\n\n【20】• Muscle attachments when a fracture occurs produce deforming forces.\n\n【21】• Treatment options include conservative, open reduction and internal fixation and  删除换行 hemiarthroplasty.删除5：<u>23</u>删除个例：<u>Orthopaedics</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 14:26:45", "endTime": "2024/09/12 14:27:01", "cost": 15.495}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:30", "update_time": "2024-09-11 22:27:01", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 22:26:45"}

The onset was sudden， and is associated with pleuritic chest pain. He was recently released from the hospital after being diagnosed with lymphoma. He had an indwelling catheter placed in his left subclavian vein the day before for chemotherapy administration. He was previously healthy without significant medical history. His vital signs are heart rate of 105 beats per minute， blood pressure 126/86 mm Hg， respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute，O， satu-ration 100% on room air. The breath sounds are clear bilaterally. His heart sounds are normal without an S， or S gallop. His left arm is mildly edematous， but otherwise painless， with a normal pulse examination.

D-dimer assav\n\n【23】E.Duplex ultrasonography of the deep veins of the upper and lower extremities\n\n【24】16.1 B. Venography is the gold standard for diagnosing thromboses of the deep veins of the extremities and is useful when duplex studies are inconclusive in high-risk， high-probability patients. Duplex ultrasonography combines direct yPaLeIs. visualization of the vein with Doppler flow signals. Part of the study relies on the examiner's ability to visualize compression of the veins to rule out an occluding thrombus. Because intra-abdominal and pelvic veins are difficult to compress， their evaluation by this method is limited. Most clinically sig-nificant PE derives from the large veins of the lower extremity， especially the iliofemoral veins that can embolize large clots to the pulmonary vasculature with disastrous hemodynamic consequences. Infrequent sources of PE can be central veins of the upper extremity， the vena cava， or even the right atrium. Despite its name， the superficial femoral vein is considered a deep vein (it accompanies the superficial femoral artery)， and can be the source of clinically significant thromboemboli. Active cancer， rather than a history of treated can-cer (>5 years) is associated with a higher risk of DVT.\n\n【25】16.2 D. ECG findings are often normal or nonspecific in patients with PE. ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities are the most common， but occasion-ally signs of right-heart stain may be noted， including peaked P waves in lead II (P pulmonale)， right-bundle-branch block， supraventricular arrhyth-mias， and right-axis deviation. The classic ECG findings of PE are S wave in lead I， Q wave in lead III， and inverted T wave in lead III (S1Q3T3)； however， this is rarely seen. ECGs may help to diagnose other etiologies of chest pain and shortness of breath such as pericarditis or tachydysrhythmias.\n\n【26】Chest radiographs are also usually normal. In severe PE， dilation of proximal pulmonary vessels with collapse of distal vasculature is noted (Westermark sign). Twenty-four to seventy-two hours after a PE， atelectasis and a focal infiltrate may be seen as a consequence of loss of surfactant. Pleural effusions may be noted， and， rarely， a triangular or rounded pleural-based infiltrate with its apex pointed to the hilum (Hampton hump) may be seen in the case of an infarction. ABG findings are often confusing， and abnormalities are usually a result of underlying pathology such as chronic obstructive pul-monary disease (COPD) or pneumonia. A low Po， in an otherwise healthy patient at risk for DVT/PE is more useful. O， saturation is rarely depressed and not very useful in the workup of PE. High sensitivity D-dimer levels are most useful for their negative predictive value in helping to rule out PE in low to moderate pretest-probability patients. It is a very sensitive， but non-specifc test. A normal high sensitivity D-dimer level in a low to moderate pretest probability patient makes PE unlikely and further diagnostic workup is not indicated.\n\n【27】16.3 B. Malignancy， acquired or inherited hypercoagulable states， previous DVT or PE， immobility， and pregnancy are all risk factors for DVT and PE. Although surgery is a known risk factor， the length of the operation and time of post-operative immobility are factors that contribute to thrombosis. The patient who underwent a noncomplicated appendectomy is at minimal risk for a DVT. Patient with the bilateral knee replacement would have very limited mobil-ity for a long period time putting him at risk for DVT and PE. Patient with ovarian cancer is at risk because of her malignancy. A patient with a previous DVT certainly has a greater lifetime risk for recurrence of a DVT. Patient had a normal vaginal delivery 10 days previously would have a higher risk of DVT than the general population.\n\n【28】16.4 D. This patient may very well have a PE， but other sources of his chest pain and shortness of breath must also be considered. An ECG will aid in the diag-nosis of cardiac etiologies including heart attacks or arrhythmias. A chest x-ray will show other possible pulmonary processes， including pneumonia or a pneu-mothorax from the central line placement (as well as confirm the position of the line). Duplex ultrasonography will help examine the venous system for thromboses and possible sources of PE， including the deep veins of the upper extremity， because this patient now has an indwelling catheter that can be a source of thrombus formation. A D-dimer assay is not useful in this patient because he is a high-probability patient and this test should only be ordered in low-probability patients. CTA would be an appropriate test to order in this patient as it can diagnose a PE as well as other etiologies of his symptoms. Also， pulmonary angiography is not yet indicated in this patient until further diagnostic workup leads one to suspect a PE as the source of his symptoms with an otherwise negative workup. Pulmonary angiography is invasive， costly， time consuming， and not without its own complications， and should therefore be used judiciously.\n\n【29】CLINICALPEARLS\n\n【30】High clinical suspicion is the most important factor in determining the workup of PE， as its presentation is often elusive.\n\n【31】High-sensitive D-dimer study is useful for its negative predictive value in excluding DVT and PE.\n\n【32】V/Qsscan is useful in risk-stratifying renalfailure aanndd possibly the pregnant patient with suspected PE.\n\n【33】MDCTA has become the initial test of choice for patients with a high pre-test probability for PE and no contraindications.\n\n【34】Eighty percent of PEs develop from DVTs involving the iliac， femoral，or popliteal veins.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 11:32:17", "endTime": "2024/09/12 11:33:09", "cost": 52.022}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:30", "update_time": "2024-09-11 19:33:09", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 19:32:17"}

The patient is unreliable in providing his medical history. His vital signs are within normal limits. On physical examination his liver edge is palpable 6 cm below the costal margin and truncal spider angiomata are noted. Ophthalmologic examination reveals dark rings around the iris. His abdomen is soft and non-tender.

The patient presents with several classic features of Wilson disease. Wilson disease, a genetic condition caused by an absolute decrease in the body’s production of a copper-binding protein called ceruloplasmin, is characterized by basal ganglia degeneration (producing parkinsonian-like symptomatology), elevated plasma copper levels, Kaiser-Fleischer rings (corneal copper deposits), micronodular cirrhosis of the liver, and neuropsychiatric symptoms.  \n\n【7】Answer A is incorrect . While the strange nature in which the patient was initially found in the street and his unwillingness to provide his medical history puts drug intoxication on the differential, the presence of other signs and symptoms (eg, corneal deposits, angiomata, and hepatomegaly) supports the diagnosis of a metabolic disorder. In addition, pupillary changes (ie, dilation and constriction) and an abnormal respiratory rate would likely be present in the case of drug intoxication.  \n\n【8】Answer B is incorrect . The patient’s age puts him in the highest risk group for HIV infection. Given the patient’s lack of cooperation and the physician’s lack of knowledge regarding his sexual activity, HIV should always be considered in a young patient presenting with altered mental status. However, the variety of other clinical findings supports a different diagnosis. In addition, most patients newly infected with HIV present with a mononucleosis-like syndrome characterized by low-grade fever, myalgias, generalized rash, fatigue, and lymphadenopathy. The patient does not have any of these symptoms.  \n\n【9】Answer C is incorrect . Parkinson disease tends to affect older adults, with a mean age of onset around 60 years. Given that Wilson disease is characterized partly by basal ganglia degeneration, both diseases may present with a rather unsteady, shuffling gait. A more convincing scenario for Parkinson disease would involve an older man with bradykinesia, masked facies, and resting tremor.  \n\n【10】Answer D is incorrect . Schizophrenia is the classic psychotic disorder with an onset that closely correlates with this patient’s age (age of onset: males, 15-25 years; females 20-30 years). In order to fulfill the diagnosis of schizophrenia, the patient must exhibit positive (eg, hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized speech and behavior) and negative (eg, poverty of speech and avolition) symptoms.

This patient has symptoms consistent with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), including difficulty initiating a stream, post-void dribbling, and frequent nighttime urination. In this case, the large prostate encasing the prostatic urethra caused urinary obstruction, leading to a decline in renal function reflected by an increase in creatinine level. On ultrasound one may be able to see dilation of the urinary collection system. A well-placed Foley catheter definitively relieves the obstruction.  \n\n【6】Answer A is incorrect. Giving fluids would improve renal function if the patient were hypovolemic. The patient’s symptoms point to an obstructive reason for his rise in creatinine level rather than to a prerenal cause.  \n\n【7】Answer B is incorrect. Dialysis would be appropriate if the patient were in renal failure. However, his creatinine level is not severely elevated, and he is still making urine. Placing a Foley catheter directly addresses the cause of the patient’s declining renal function.  \n\n【8】Answer D is incorrect.

Embracing all the selves: Helping the client to achieve awareness of each part, reclaiming “disowned parts,” and permitting verbal expression from each part without fearing it will take over the personality.\n2.  Strengthening the executive parts of the personality: A strong, competent “captain” needs to be behind the steering wheel, assuring that no single part dominates or acts unilaterally. This executive part examines the messages from different parts, describes and analyzes internal and interpersonal process, and communicates to others to resolve conflict. The client experiences increased choice, self-control, and autonomy.\n3.  Modifying parts: Goals will include toning down a part that is too dominant, supporting and strengthening weak and vulnerable parts that need to be heard, updating the rules and methods of powerful Parent parts, creating new parts to serve important functions such as boosting self-esteem and soothing painful affects, and developing a strategy to deal with self-destructive parts.\n4.  Learning to tolerate vulnerability in the self and in others: This goal creates the opportunity for intimacy and the development of mature ways of taking care of one’s need for safety and trusting relationships.\n5.  Unified, goal-directed activity: The attainment of goals is only possible if all of the inner parts have reached an agreement to work together. When people have difficulty achieving their self-determined goals, it is useful to search for the inner part that is opposed. Compromises between parts can be negotiated: “I’ll let you work on this book now if you give me pumpkin pie with ice cream two hours from now.”\n\n【3】### The Concept of Resistance\n\n【4】Resistance is often explained as a battle between inner parts: one part wants to change, while the other does not—out of fear of the risks, or enjoyment of the benefits of staying the same (secondary gains). Using the terms from TA, therapists need to make the contract for change with the Adult (the executive part of the personality), making sure that the Natural Child is going to get its needs met and “sign on” to the agreement. If the contract is made only with a Parent (“should”) part, resistance is almost guaranteed. When setting goals, you might want to ask, Imagine that you have just achieved the change (goal) you want. What part of you would be unhappy about that?  A client can appear resistant in therapy when there is not only internal conflict but also lack of particular skills.\n\n【5】The Internal Parts 通用删除11(英):<u>(P1)</u> hypothesis integrates well with the Freedom and Responsibility (ES2) hypothesis; when people are struggling with making responsible choices, it can help to examine internal parts and the sources of ambivalence. Many of the problems in Table 13.1 are examples of difficulties in making choices and following through. Common conflicts are between the following pairs of parts: Spontaneous Free Spirit versus Responsible Controller , Courageous Risk-Taker versus Security-at-any-cost , and Head versus Heart. The therapist needs to be careful to not take a You-should-change position when the client is speaking from an I-don’t-want-to-change voice. Instead, you need to convey that the choice is entirely up to the client—that means that the two parts of the conflict remain inside the client. This attitude of rolling with resistance is a technique of Motivational Interviewing, an intervention with strong empirical support 删除10：<u>(Lundahl, Kunz, Brownell, Tollefson, & Burke, 2010)</u>.\n\n【6】### Psychoeducation\n\n【7】The concept of internal parts and subpersonalities can be directly taught, using diagrams on a white board or paper if this helps the client to visualize what you are explaining. With this approach, the client is encouraged to practice identifying inner parts and recognizing which part is speaking at any given time. There are many books that clients can read, such as Born to Win 删除10：<u>(James & Jongeward, 1996)</u> or Embracing Our Selves 删除10：<u>(H. Stone & S. Stone, 1989)</u>; you can suggest journaling or using a self-monitoring chart to practice identifying internal parts. Through these experiences, the client strengthens the executive part of the personality—known by names such as Aware Ego, Adult, or Higher Self—that has awareness of all the inner parts and can analyze their dynamics.\n\n【8】### Identifying Inner Parts\n\n【9】Listen to what the client says and respond by identifying different inner parts or voices, using a tentative tone that shows you are open to being corrected:\n\n【10】1.  It sounds like a part of you really wants to succeed, but another part is ready to give up.\n2.  What exactly does that inner voice say to you?\n3.  I get the impression that there’s a Parent voice telling you to study hard, but the Child part just wants to have fun.\n\n【11】Inner parts work is enhanced when the subpersonalities are given nicknames 删除10：<u>(Polster, 1995)</u>. It is best to let the client choose the name, but the therapist can make suggestions: It sounds like you have a real Perfectionist operating. Let’s hear from the Inner Critic. Is there a Free Spirit part that wants to respond? The client might recognize inner personalities and give them names such as Achiever, Caretaker, or Pleaser.\n\n【12】An example of someone who is struggling to lose weight illustrates how these inner parts function in internal conflict:\n\n【13】1.  Critical parent: You should take those pounds off. What’s wrong with you? You’re a self-indulgent, lazy loser—no I can’t call you a loser, you’re not losing but gaining.\n2.  Nurturing parent: Don’t worry, I know you’re really stressed. Go ahead and have some ice cream, it will make you feel better.\n3.  Natural child: I love food! It tastes so good. It is so much fun! I feel so good when I eat an ice-cream cone.\n4.  Adapted child: I know I’m bad; what’s wrong with me? I keep trying, but I just can’t do it.\n5.  Rebellious child: I’m going to eat whatever I want and you can’t stop me. I don’t care about your stupid rules; you just don’t want me to be happy.\n6.  Adult: Let’s come up with a plan where I can maintain a steady weight loss of one pound a week yet still eat foods I enjoy and have certain meals where I can disregard the rules.\n\n【14】### Creating New Inner Messages\n\n【15】Each of the different subselves provides its own stream of internal talk; the Dysfunctional Self-Talk (C4) hypothesis can be integrated, and more adaptive self-talk goals can be set for specific parts. For instance, an Inner Critic can develop a more positive, constructive way of speaking: Instead of saying, You messed up! You’re stupid; you can’t get anything right, it could say Let’s learn from this mistake; you’ll do better next time. Don’t give up! If there is a lack of self-nurturing, the person can agree to build habits of positive self-talk and practice this new part until it feels natural. For example, the person with a strong Workaholic part can build an Advocate for Relaxation who says things like Take the weekend off and you’ll be more productive next week.\n\n【16】### Experiential Techniques\n\n【17】Although experiential techniques differ, they share a common feature: The client does not talk about the parts, but talks from each part. A separate location (e.g. position of a chair or a different chair) is designated for each separate part, and the client must switch positions to talk from a different part. If, in the course of the interview, the client and therapist have identified and discussed different parts or voices, it can be a very natural next step to invite the client to let each part “speak for itself.” This can be by simple invitation ( Let’s hear directly from that judging part ). The therapist must feel comfortable saying things like I’d like to hear from a different part now. Are you the part that is afraid? I’m hearing a different part creep in, let’s hear from her later. You will gather important data just by seeing if accessing different parts comes naturally. For clients who are unclear about the instructions or are self-conscious and afraid of appearing ridiculous, give clear directives and a bit of reassurance and coaching. You may also use yourself as a model, and disclose how your inner parts work in a common, nonthreatening dilemma, such as deciding on where to go for vacation. You must be willing to drop the suggestion of an experiential activity if it seems inappropriate to or uncomfortable for the client.\n\n【18】### Gestalt Two-Chair Technique\n\n【19】In the Gestalt two-chair technique, the therapist guides the client back and forth between two parts, each spatially linked to a different chair. The therapist’s role is to clarify which part is speaking and to make sure that the client is talking to the other chair and staying in role. The timing of the shift can come from the therapist’s instruction ( Now switch! ) or from the client’s own sense of when the other part should respond. Through this activity, the client comes to understand each part and what it wants and fears. It is important to have training and to be well-supervised when using this technique: the dialogue can become very emotional, and the spontaneity and intensity of the experience can overcome the client’s defenses. This method is not appropriate for making major life decisions, for which we need participation of Adult parts to rationally evaluate consequences. As you get to know an internal part, it may become apparent that the internal voice is an exact replica of a parent’s voice. At that point, the client can be asked to play the role of that parent rather than an inner part. When the client switches to the other chair and confronts the parent, it presents a chance to resolve “unfinished business” from childhood, and the Recurrent Pattern 通用删除11(英):<u>(P2)</u> hypothesis becomes relevant.\n\n【20】### Voice Dialogue\n\n【21】Hal Stone and Sidra Stone 通用删除7(英):<u>(1989, 1993)</u> created a typology of subselves, including Rulemaker, Pusher, Inner Critic, Perfectionist, Power Broker, Judge, Playful Child, Vulnerable Child, and Magical Child, which are comparable to Berne’s Parent and Child states. Their therapeutic technique, Voice Dialogue, is much safer than the Gestalt two-chair technique. The separate parts never dialogue directly with each other, but instead take turns talking to the facilitator. Then the “whole personality” has a chance to reflect on what each part has said, thus promoting the client’s self-reflection and protecting the client from experiencing any one part as overwhelmingly powerful. The skills needed by the facilitator are basic listening skills, nonjudgmental acceptance of each part, and the ability to refrain from trying to implement any change until the activity is over .\n\n【22】通用删除14(英):<u>To learn more about</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 13:34:27", "endTime": "2024/09/12 13:34:35", "cost": 7.846}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:30", "update_time": "2024-09-11 21:34:33", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 21:34:25"}

She is a G2P2002, married, nonsmoker who desires to discuss contraceptive options. She does desire to become pregnant again but not in the near future. She denies any prior sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and has no significant medical concerns or complaints.\n\n【2】 What are the long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) agents ?\n\n【3】 As compared to oral contraceptive (OC) agents, what are the advantages of LARC agents?\n\n【4】 What are the mechanisms of action of the types of LARCs?\n\n【5】ANSWERS TO CASE 54:\n\n【6】Contraceptive Management\n\n【7】Summary : A 25-year-old female without medical problems or complaints who desires long-term but reversible contraception\n\n【8】 The LARC category of contraceptives include IUD (copper vs. Mirena— progestin based), hormone injections (progesterone based), and subdermal implants such as Implanon (progestin based).\n\n【9】 An advantage of LARC over OCP (oral contraceptive pill) is that they do not have to be taken daily by the patient and as such often results in higher typical use efficacy.\n\n【10】 The LARC agents are either progestin based or copper based. The mechanism of action for the progesterone only products (Implanon, Depo-Provera injection, Mirena IUD) are to suppress ovulation and make the cervical environment less favorable for sperm survival/transport and endometrial implantation. The copper IUD functions as a spermicide (inhibits sperm motility/transport/acrosomal enzyme action and prevents fertilization of the ovum.\n\n【11】#### CLINICAL CORRELATION\n\n【12】The choice of contraception depends on a variety of factors. In some cases the risk of comorbidities may limit the options. At times the choice is dependent on logistics of how often the contraceptive has to be used. Duration of desired contraception is another key factor in choosing the right contraceptive for a given patient. In patients who prefer concurrent STI prevention, barrier methods would be ideal. In patients who no longer desire fertility, surgical options may be suggested. A thorough medical/surgical/social history along with a full review of systems should be done prior to initiation of contraception to offer a customized method for the patient. Some of the contraceptives may offer other noncontraceptive benefits (discussed later). Cost is another factor in choosing contraceptives. Often, minor side effects will abate in a few months, so having this discussion with the patient in the beginning may minimize confusion and frustration.\n\n【13】If unprotected sex occurs and pregnancy is not desired, emergency contraceptives are readily available and are a viable option. However, the patient must be informed that this method should not be the sole contraceptive management, nor should it be used in preventing STIs.\n\n【14】APPROACH TO:\n\n【15】Contraceptive Agents\n\n【16】#### OBJECTIVES\n\n【17】1\\.

For a full discussion on all the options (natural family planning, hormonal agents, surgical techniques, barrier methods) refer to the Family Medicine and/or Obstetrics and Gynecology Case Files .\n删除4：<u>Table 54–1 • Contraceptive Options</u>\n\n【26】#### CLASSES OF AGENTS\n\n【27】##### Oral Contraceptive (OC) Agents\n\n【28】All oral contraceptive agents are hormonal agents, but differ in that they can either be a combination of estrogen/progestin or be a progestin only. Most of the OCPs contain the combination, although there are a few that have only progesterone. The extended duration contraceptive pills also contain combination of estrogen and progesterone.\n\n【29】The estrogen component is typically ethinyl estradiol, whereas the progesterone may vary and is usually either a first, second, third, or fourth generation (pregnanes, estranes, gonanes, or drospirenone products, respectively). The combination OCPs can vary in their dosing strength of the individual components, whereas all the other options have fixed dosing. The ethinyl estradiol may commonly come in the following strengths: 20, 25, 30, 35 micrograms. The progesterone dose varies based on the individual component used. The combination OCP may also come as monophasic or biphasic/triphasic options—the latter two where the individual components vary in their dose based on the day to reflect the physiologic variations. The monophasic options have less menstrual irregularities in general. Nausea, headaches, elevated blood pressure, weight gain, decreased libido, and dyslipidemia may occur with the estrogen component but often can be diminished by decreasing the dose of estrogen or with continued use. Due to the EE component, there is also a low risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and cardiovascular disease that is increased in smokers (especially those who smoke >15 cigarettes daily) or women above the age of 35. These risks are less than 1 percent. The possible association with breast cancer in estrogen containing products is also low (<1%). The World Health Organization (WHO) has categorized the precautions and contraindications to OCP use into four categories. Some of the noncontraceptive benefits of using combination estrogen/progesterone products include reduction in ovarian and endometrial cancer, improvements in acne, dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia, metrorrhagia, and functional cysts. For progesterone-based products, the main adverse events include risk for hirsutism, acne, menstrual irregularity, and spotting. There are also concerns of weight gain and decreased bone mineral density with continued use. The progestin-only pills are also less effective than the combination OCPs (0.5% vs. 0.1% failure rate of progestin only vs. combination OCP with perfect use or 1% to 3% failure rate for either product with typical use) and also have less flexibility in timing. The oral agents have many interactions that can affect the effectiveness of the OCP or the other medication.\n\n【30】Mechanism of Action\n\n【31】The estrogen component inhibits ovulation by suppressing LH and FSH and prevents implantation. The progesterone component inhibits ovulation by suppressing LH, thickens cervical mucus, and thins the endometrial lining thereby preventing sperm transport and implantation.\n\n【32】Administration\n\n【33】The OCPs (combination and progestin-only pills) are taken orally around the same time each day. The progestin-only pills have less flexibility (need to be taken within an hour of the time daily, whereas the combination pills may be taken within 3 hours of the daily time). The OCPs come in a pack of 21 active pills and 7 placebo pills. With the use of the placebo pills, the patient will start her withdrawal bleed. If a patient prefers to limit her menses then she can opt to just take the active pills continuously or use a marketed extended use agent. Seasonale and Seasonique are two commercially marketed extended duration OCPs. Despite patient concerns, this approach is effective and has not shown evidence of increased harm. Patients may customize when they have their menses as well by when they start the OCP pack; for example, starting on a Sunday would in theory eliminate menses on weekends. Emergency contraception at present is marketed as an oral tablet (progestin based) that can be taken either as 2 tablets at once or each one 12 hours apart— Plan B. A new option, Ella (a progesterone agonist/antagonist) is a single 30-mg tablet that is reportedly effective up to 5 days post intercourse. Apart from this, many commercially available OCPs can be used for emergency contraception by altering the amount of pills taken. This form is most effective if taken immediately after, but success rates are still high 24–120 hours post unprotected intercourse.\n\n【34】Pharmacokinetics\n\n【35】Due to the lipophilic nature of the estrogens and progestins, these drugs are readily absorbed following oral administration. The ethinyl substitution on 17β-estradiol inhibits first-pass hepatic metabolism. Estrogens undergo enterohepatic recirculation, which depends in part on hydrolysis of hepatic conjugates in the gut by bacterial enzymes. Antibiotic treatment can reduce effectiveness of OCP or HRT (Hormone Replacement Therapy). Several medications may interact with OC agents.\n\n【36】##### Transdermal and Intravaginal Agents\n\n【37】Currently available transdermal (Ortho Evra) and intravaginal (NuvaRing) contraceptives are both combination estrogen/progestin products. These agents provide a more consistent delivery of the hormones and permit a lower dose than oral preparations. The intravaginal product, NuvaRing, is placed into the posterior fornix of the vagina, left in place for 3 weeks, and removed for 1 week. The transdermal product (Ortho Evra) is placed on the buttock/upper torso/abdomen/upper arm weekly and changed once a week for 3 weeks, with the 4th week being a patch-free period. The Ortho Evra patch is restricted to patients less than 198 pounds due to decreased effectiveness in patients above this weight. The efficacy, mechanism of action, benefits, and risks are comparable to the combination OC agents. These agents also have the same noncontraceptive benefits as the combination OC agents. Local skin or mucosal irritation may occur with either of these options but are not typical.\n\n【38】##### Barrier Methods\n\n【39】Commonly available barrier methods include male and female condoms, diaphragm, cervical caps, and contraceptive sponges. Neither the condoms nor contraceptive sponges require a prescription. These agents have fewer side effects than hormonal contraception and have the dual benefit of contraception and STI prevention. Additionally, if a double barrier is used (eg, condom + vaginal spermicide or diaphragm + condom), efficacy increases substantially. The major issue with these options is compliance with use as they are only effective if a new product is used at each episode of intercourse. Oral condoms are also available to provide additional protection. Another drawback of this method is the possibility of improper placement or breakage in which case both contraception and STI prevention are compromised. Local skin or mucosal reactions are usually uncommon.\n\n【40】##### Long-Acting Reversible Contraceptive (LARC) Agents\n\n【41】LARCs commonly used in the United States include medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo-Provera as the Brand) progesterone acetate injections (DMPAs), Mirena (progestin based) IUD, Implanon (progestin based) subdermal agent, and copper IUD. DMPA is an injectable progesterone-based contraceptive that is given intramuscularly or subcutaneously (Depo-sub QProvera 104) every 3 months. Its efficacy is higher than the oral progestin mainly due to the fact that patients do not have to take the medication daily. DMPA is administered subcutaneously (SQ) and has been available since 2010. It uses 30 percent less hormone, is less painful, has similar efficacy, and has had success for self-administration by the patient in several trials. The predominant adverse effects of DMPA (SQ and IM) include weight gain of 3.5 to 5 pounds in the first year and menstrual irregularity/amenorrhea. There are also long-term concerns of decreases in bone mineral density with the use of any progesterone-only contraceptive agent. Intrauterine devices are typically inserted as an office procedure while the patient is on her menses and is to be removed in 5 or 10 years. The Mirena IUD (5-year product) has the same benefits/risks/mechanism of action as the other progestin-based products. The Mirena IUD may also be used for emergency contraception. The copper IUD (10-year product) functions essentially as a barrier agent and as a spermicide (inhibits sperm motility/transport/acrosomal enzyme action) and prevents fertilization of the ovum. Most common side effects include increased dysmenorrhea or increased menstrual flow for the first few months. The intradermal product (Implanon) is inserted as an office procedure subdermally into the medial aspect of the upper arm and removed in 1 year or 3 years depending on the product used. Implanon has the same mechanism of action/benefits/risks as the other progestin-only products.\n\n【42】##### Permanent Contraception\n\n【43】For women and their partners who desire permanent sterility, currently available options include bilateral tubal ligation, vasectomy, hysterectomy (if other indications), and fallopian tube obstruction methods (Essure and Adiana). Vasectomy is an office procedure that can be done in the primary care or specialist office and requires only local anesthesia. The procedure often takes 30 minutes to complete but requires the male to submit semen samples until sterility is assured (typically 6 weeks). Although reversal may be possible depending on the technique used initially, patients should be counseled that this is a permanent procedure. Bilateral tubal ligation is an operative procedure done under general anesthesia in the operating room. This may be reversed, but generally is considered a permanent procedure. Essure and Adiana are permanent sterilization techniques in which silicone coils are inserted into the fallopian tubes, which eventually lead to permanent scarring/occlusion of the area and offer permanent sterilization. This procedure is typically done via an office procedure and requires a separate procedure termed hysterosalpingogram (HSG) for placement and for verification. Once the procedure success has been verified (typically 3 months), sterility is fairly assured.\n\n【44】####", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 14:33:21", "endTime": "2024/09/12 14:33:56", "cost": 34.776}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:30", "update_time": "2024-09-11 22:33:55", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 22:33:20"}

This man appears to be suffering from an acute stroke (cerebrovascular accident or CVA). After confirming that it is not a hemorrhagic stroke with a CT scan, the next step in treatment is administration of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) if the duration of stroke has been <3 hours. The major adverse effect of tPA is bleeding. Excess bleeding must be reversed with aminocaproic acid, which blocks the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin.  \n\n【7】Answer B is incorrect . Protamine sulfate is used to reverse the effects of heparin. It is a positively-charged molecule that binds to negatively charged heparin molecules, thereby neutralizing the molecule and rendering it ineffective. Protamine sulfate would not reverse bleeding associated with tPA.  \n\n【8】Answer C is incorrect . Recombinant factor VIII is used to treat hemophilia A. These patients do not make factor VIII so it must be replaced. It would not reverse bleeding associated with tPA.  \n\n【9】Answer D is incorrect . tPA is an enzyme that normally cleaves plasminogen to plasmin.

Phase length is 14 days.\n\n【22】CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【23】Diagnosis Criteria\n\n【24】The diagnosis of PMDD is based upon a perimenstrual pattern of at least five affec-tive， physical (somatic)， and/or behavioral symptoms， with at least one of the four key affective symptoms being：\n\n【25】Affective lability\n\n【26】Irritability or anger that is often characterized by increased interpersonal conflicts\n\n【27】Marked depressed mood， hopelessness， or self-deprecating thoughts\n\n【28】Anxiety， tension， or feeling on edge\n\n【29】There may be difficulty concentrating or a sense of feeling overwhelmed or out of control. These cognitive-affective symptoms can be accompanied by behavioral and somatic symptoms such as loss of interest in usual activities， lack of energy， changes in appetite or food cravings， changes in sleep， and physical symptoms unique to the premenstruum such as breast tenderness， breast swelling， or bloating. Per DSM-5criteria， these symptoms must have occurred during most menstrual cycles in the past year to meet criteria for PMDD diagnosis. Symptoms start during the luteal phase of menstrual cycle and are severe from 3 to 4 days prior to onset of menses to up to 3 days post-menses onset. Symptoms improve during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle and must be absent by the postmenstrual week. Patients should be encouraged to record their symptoms using various available tools such as the calendar of premenstrual experiences or premenstrual assessment tool. The presence of two or more symptomatic cycles showing clear symptom commence-ment and resolution will aid toward the diagnosis， while the presence of symptoms throughout the cycle may point toward other psychiatric disorders. Table 15-1lists the diagnostic criteria for PMDD.\n\n| Table15-1·DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FORPREMENSTRUAL  |\n| --- |\n| DYSPHORIC DISORDER  |\n| During the majority of menstrual cycles over the last year， multiple symptoms begin the weekbefore menses， improve within days after the onset of menses， and are minimal/absent during the post-menses week. At least five symptoms total from both mood and associated symptom categories： Mood Symptoms ·Depression，hopelessness，self-deprecation ·Affective instability， mood swings， rejection sensitivity · Increased irritability，anger， or interpersonal conflicts · Significant anxiety and tension Associated Symptoms ·Decreased interest ·Concentration difficulty · Insomnia or hypersomnia ·Fatigue or decreased energy ·Easily overwhelmed ·Change in appetite or specific cravings ·Weight gain， bloating，muscle/joint pain， breast tenderness， or swelling Symptoms cause significant distress or impairment in functioning. Symptoms are not caused by substance abuse， medication， or a medical condition.  |\n\n【31】Pathogenesis\n\n【32】The timing of symptom onset and offset in PMDD suggests that hormonal fluc-tuation is a key component in PMDD’s pathogenesis. Although there have been no measurable differences in hormonal levels in women with or without PMDD， recent research suggests that women with PMDD have altered sensitivity to normal hormonal fluctuations， particularly estrogen and progesterone—neuroactive steroids that influence central nervous system function， which is believed to be the etiology of this disorder. The premenstruum， along with postpartum and perimenopause， are all periods of hormonal fluctuation and thus windows of vulnerability for mood disorders. These physiologic hormonal changes trigger mood symptoms for some women. Premenstrual syndrome (PMS)/PMDD can be considered a significant risk factor for postpartum depression. Many women suffer from mild nonpatho-logic premenstrual issues； 2% to 5% of premenopausal women experience clinical symptoms that cause impairment in functioning. PMDD may begin at any time after menarche and symptoms remit after menopause. Cyclical hormone replace-ment can potentially retrigger PMDD symptoms.\n\n【33】Differential Diagnosis\n\n【34】Medical Conditions. As always， rule out direct effect of substance or another medi-cal condition as the underlying cause. Thyroid dysfunction， fibromyalgia， and irri-table bowel syndrome may manifest similarly. Exogenous hormones prescribed to alleviate premenstrual symptoms may sometimes cause or exacerbate the problem. Evaluate if the symptoms occur after initiation of hormonal therapy and if they resolve with medication discontinuation.\n\n【35】Premenstrual Syndrome. PMS is generally less severe than PMDD with fewer symptoms and without significant mood changes. There is a higher prevalence of PMS compared to PMDD. Dysmenorrhea describes pain associated with menses but lacks mood changes. The pain begins with the onset of menses， whereas in PMDD the symptoms improve during menses. Perimenopause presents similarly as PMS but without the cyclicity.\n\n【36】Mood Disorders. Mood disorders including major depressive disorder (MDD)， persistent depressive disorder， and bipolar disorder may be on the differential. The key aspect in delineating a diagnosis involves examining the timing of symptom onset in relation to the premenstrual phase. Clinical trials have revealed that mood swings and irritability are the most severe of the affective symptoms while depressed mood was least， which further distinguishes PMDD from MDD. Although bipo-lar disorder commonly presents with irritability and mood lability， the predictable perimenstrual pattern is specific to PMDD.\n\n【37】Symptoms of psychiatric and medical conditions can worsen during the pre-menstrual phase， but the symptoms do not resolve postmenstruation. In addition to gathering a thorough history and collateral information， ask the patient to use daily prospective ratings for at least two consecutive cycles to obtain more objective data.\n\n【38】Treatment\n\n【39】Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inbibitors. SSRIs have emerged as first-line therapy for PMDD， targeting irritability， depression， and associated physical symptoms within days. Notably， SSRIs work faster in PMS/PMDD compared to any other psychiatric disorder. This rapid onset of action is likely due to the SSRIs’ability to enhance formation of neuroactive steroids， such as ALLO. This short onset of action makes intermittent dosing (administering the medication only during the luteal phase， from the time of ovulation until menstruation begins) possible. SSRIs may be started after the onset of symptoms of PMDD (symptom-onset therapy) as well， and relatively low doses have shown to be effective. Continuous therapy may be more effective for patients with erratic menstrual cycles or in those who cannot follow the dosing regimen. Continuous dosing is ideal in the case of comorbid mood/anxiety disorders or SSRI discontinuation syndrome. Some studies indicate that PMDD symptoms respond better to SSRIs when compared to SNRIs.\n\n【40】Other Treatment Options. Previous studies indicate that TCAs are generally not efficacious， with the exception of clomipramine. Hormonal therapy including com-bination oral contraceptives suppress ovulation， thus eliminating the luteal phase， and predominately address the associated physical discomfort. Oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) should be used with caution， as some studies have shown exogenous hormones to negatively impact mood. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog has been used to suppress ovarian function and thus the hormones. Any hormonal treatment that needs to be continued for 3 or more months must be managed by gynecologists. Cognitive behavioral therapy may be useful in helping patients better manage their symptoms.\n\n【41】CASE CORRELATION\n\n【42】● See also Case 13 (Major Depressive Disorder) and Case 14 (Persistent Depressive Disorder).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【42】● See also Case 13 (Major Depressive Disorder) and Case 14 (Persistent Depressive Disorder).", "content": "【0】CASE 15\n\n【1】A 33-year-old woman who works as an artist presents to the clinic requesting a referral for marriage counseling.

There is debate in the orthopaedic community regarding the best treatment modality for acute Achilles tendon ruptures.

New York， NY： McGraw-Hill； 2009：Fig. 11-77.</u></u>\n\n【19】CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【20】Etiologies\n\n【21】Diagnosis of Achilles tendon ruptures are increasing in incidence as more“weekend warrior” athletes are pushing the limits of their typically sedentary and decondi-tioned bodies. Additionally， the medical community is becoming more aware of and skilled at diagnosing the injury. This injury is commonly observed in men in their fourth through sixth decades of life.\n\n【22】Pathoanatomy\n\n【23】The gastrocnemius and soleus muscle bodies are contained within the superficial posterior compartment of the leg. These muscle bodies converge to form a common Achilles tendon， which inserts on the posterior tuberosity of the calcaneus. This musculotendinous unit acts to plantarflex the foot. The Achilles tendon most com-monly ruptures when the gastrocnemius-soleus complex undergoes eccentric load-ing with the ankle dorsiflexed and the knee extended. Patients are usually able to describe the incident in which they were pushing off or landing on a plantarflexed foot. Most Achilles tendon injuries occur in a hypovascular watershed area located approximately 2 to 6 cm proximal to its insertion. Repetitive microtrauma to this vulnerable hypovascular region is thought to predispose it to rupture.\n\n【24】Physical Exam\n\n【25】Along with the clinical history， the physical exam is key to diagnosing an Achilles tendon rupture. Despite increasing awareness in the medical community， approxi-mately 25% of Achilles tendon ruptures are initially misdiagnosed as ankle sprains. Visual inspection of the affected extremities will likely reveal significant soft tissue swelling in the heel region. A palpable gap， erythema， and/or a bulging muscle mass may be noted after an acute rupture. The Thompson test  will aid the clinician in establishing the diagnosis of an Achilles tendon rupture. Although plantarflexion is frequently compromised， be aware that the patient may still exhibit active plantarflexion due to the functions of the unaffected toe flexor and posterior tibialis muscles.\n\n【26】Imaging\n\n【27】The diagnosis of an Achilles tendon rupture is primarily a clinical diagnosis. Imag-ing studies are generally reserved for situations in which the physical exam is inconclusive. Plain radiographs of the lower leg have limited use in diagnosing soft tissues injuries but can adequately rule out any bony injuries and sometimes dem-onstrate soft tissue swelling. Ultrasound is another imaging modality that can be useful. Although inexpensive， its utility is greatly operator dependent. MRI is the gold standard imaging modality but is not necessary in a clinically obvious diagno-sis of Achilles tendon rupture . It may， however， be useful in discern-ing subtleties of partial or chronic Achilles tendon injuries. Of note， the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons Clinical Practice Guideline Summary for acute Achilles tendon rupture states that“We are unable to recommend for or against the\n删除3：<u>Figure 34-2.

New York， NY： McGraw-Hill； 2006：Fig.9-58.</u> 删除换行 routine use of MRI， ultrasonography， and radiography to confirm the diagnosis of acute Achilles tendon rupture.”In other words， it remains a clinical diagnosis.</u>\n\n【28】The treatment for an Achilles tendon rupture is controversial and should be indi-vidualized to each patient. The primary goal is to reestablish the normal anatomy of the muscle and tendon， in turn restoring function to the musculotendinous unit. If the tendon is left to heal in either extreme of dorsiflexion or plantarflexion， the mechanical functioning of the gastrocnemius-soleus complex with the tendon could be compromised.\n\n【29】Nonoperative treatment is reserved for older， sedentary individuals with multiple medical comorbidities that may compromise wound healing. It focuses on immo-bilizing the affected leg in a gravity equinus position that maximizes apposition of the 2 ends of the ruptured tendon. Posterior splints， removable boots and short leg casts for 6 to 8 weeks can all stabilize the foot in this manner. Gradual range of motion and resistance exercises begin at 8 to 10 weeks. Such management lacks the risks of surgery， which include infection， wound breakdown， and nerve injury.\n\n【30】However， the limitations of conservative management include suboptimal tendon length after healing and diminished muscle function. Patients must be warned that they will likely have residual weakness and that it can take up to 1 year before maximal plantarflexion is achieved. Furthermore， some studies have shown an increased re-rupture rate with nonoperative management.\n\n【31】Common indications for operative treatment include acute ruptures in young， healthy， active individuals， and following re-rupture of previously immobilization-treated Achilles ruptures. It can be accomplished via open and percutaneous tech-niques. The surgical approach is on the medial side of the Achilles tendon sheath. The frayed edges are debrided， and the foot is positioned in equinus. Two heavy nonabsorbable sutures are then woven through 3 to 4 cm of each tendon edge， using a Bunnell or Kessler stitch technique. The repair can be augmented with lighter， absorbable sutures or with the plantaris tendon if it is present. Although surgical repair decreases re-rupture rate and increases maximal plantarflexion strength， it does have risks and complications， including infection， skin sloughing and necrosis， and sural nerve damage.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【27】", "content": "【0】Case 34\nA 35-year-old man is brought to the emergency department (ED) by his basketball teammates for evaluation of his right leg.

Additionally， the medical community is becoming more aware of and skilled at diagnosing the injury. This injury is commonly observed in men in their fourth through sixth decades of life.\n\n【22】Pathoanatomy\n\n【23】The gastrocnemius and soleus muscle bodies are contained within the superficial posterior compartment of the leg. These muscle bodies converge to form a common Achilles tendon， which inserts on the posterior tuberosity of the calcaneus. This musculotendinous unit acts to plantarflex the foot. The Achilles tendon most com-monly ruptures when the gastrocnemius-soleus complex undergoes eccentric load-ing with the ankle dorsiflexed and the knee extended. Patients are usually able to describe the incident in which they were pushing off or landing on a plantarflexed foot. Most Achilles tendon injuries occur in a hypovascular watershed area located approximately 2 to 6 cm proximal to its insertion. Repetitive microtrauma to this vulnerable hypovascular region is thought to predispose it to rupture.\n\n【24】Physical Exam\n\n【25】Along with the clinical history， the physical exam is key to diagnosing an Achilles tendon rupture. Despite increasing awareness in the medical community， approxi-mately 25% of Achilles tendon ruptures are initially misdiagnosed as ankle sprains. Visual inspection of the affected extremities will likely reveal significant soft tissue swelling in the heel region. A palpable gap， erythema， and/or a bulging muscle mass may be noted after an acute rupture. The Thompson test  will aid the clinician in establishing the diagnosis of an Achilles tendon rupture. Although plantarflexion is frequently compromised， be aware that the patient may still exhibit active plantarflexion due to the functions of the unaffected toe flexor and posterior tibialis muscles.\n\n【26】Imaging\n\n【27】The diagnosis of an Achilles tendon rupture is primarily a clinical diagnosis. Imag-ing studies are generally reserved for situations in which the physical exam is inconclusive. Plain radiographs of the lower leg have limited use in diagnosing soft tissues injuries but can adequately rule out any bony injuries and sometimes dem-onstrate soft tissue swelling. Ultrasound is another imaging modality that can be useful. Although inexpensive， its utility is greatly operator dependent. MRI is the gold standard imaging modality but is not necessary in a clinically obvious diagno-sis of Achilles tendon rupture . It may， however， be useful in discern-ing subtleties of partial or chronic Achilles tendon injuries.

The primary goal is to reestablish the normal anatomy of the muscle and tendon， in turn restoring function to the musculotendinous unit.

It focuses on immo-bilizing the affected leg in a gravity equinus position that maximizes apposition of the 2 ends of the ruptured tendon. Posterior splints， removable boots and short leg casts for 6 to 8 weeks can all stabilize the foot in this manner. Gradual range of motion and resistance exercises begin at 8 to 10 weeks. Such management lacks the risks of surgery， which include infection， wound breakdown， and nerve injury.\n\n【30】However， the limitations of conservative management include suboptimal tendon length after healing and diminished muscle function. Patients must be warned that they will likely have residual weakness and that it can take up to 1 year before maximal plantarflexion is achieved. Furthermore， some studies have shown an increased re-rupture rate with nonoperative management.\n\n【31】Common indications for operative treatment include acute ruptures in young， healthy， active individuals， and following re-rupture of previously immobilization-treated Achilles ruptures.

The frayed edges are debrided， and the foot is positioned in equinus. Two heavy nonabsorbable sutures are then woven through 3 to 4 cm of each tendon edge， using a Bunnell or Kessler stitch technique. The repair can be augmented with lighter， absorbable sutures or with the plantaris tendon if it is present.

The patient was playing a pick-up game at the local gym earlier in the day， at which time he planted his right foot for a jump shot and suddenly felt as though someone kicked him in the back of his leg， although when he looked back no one was close by. The patient reports feeling a“snap”in his calf， experiencing intense pain， and falling to the ground. In the ED， his vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of his left lower extremity reveals a palpable， tender “bulging”mass over his calf and a soft depression on the posterior aspect of his heel. There is no bony tenderness of the left lower extremity. On passive range of motion， there is increased dorsiflexion in the left foot compared with the right foot. The patient cannot actively plantarflex his left foot.\n\n【1】What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【2】What is the next step in workup?\n\n【3】What is the best treatment?\n\n【4】ANSWERS TO CASE 34：Achilles Tendon Rupture\n\n【5】Summary： A 35-year-old man presents with left lower extremity pain after hearing a“snap”in the back of his leg while planting his foot to take a shot during a basket-ball game. He states that it felt like someone kicked him. Immediately afterward he noticed significant posterior heel swelling. He is unable to actively plantarflex his foot. On exam， you note increased passive range of dorsiflexion on his left side when compared with his right as well as a palpable defect in his Achilles tendon.\n\n【6】· Most likely diagnosis： Achilles tendon rupture.\n\n【7】Next step in workup： Pain control， plain radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the left distal tibia and fibula and ankle if the diagnosis is unclear. Ultrasound is an effective alternative modality for diagnosing an Achilles tendon rupture if MRI is unavailable or contraindicated.\n\n【8】· Best treatment： Primary surgical repair.\n\n【9】ANALYSIS\n\n【10】Objectives\n\n【11】1\\. Understand how to clinically diagnose an acute Achilles tendon rupture using history and specific physical exam maneuvers.\n\n【12】2\\. Be familiar with treatment options， both nonoperative and operative， for managing Achilles tendon ruptures.\n\n【13】3\\. Recognize the indications for various treatment options and understand their respective advantages and disadvantages.\n\n【14】Considerations\n\n【15】Initial treatment for this 35-year-old man with a presumed Achilles tendon rupture should focus on pain relief and placing the affected leg in a splint that ensures immobilization in a plantarflexed position. The goal of this initial stabilization is to restore the natural length of the musculotendinous unit disrupted by the injury. The primary goal of treatment is to alleviate pain and restore function. There is debate in the orthopaedic community regarding the best treatment modality for acute Achilles tendon ruptures. Nonoperative treatment includes a period of 6 to 8 weeks of splint or cast immobilization. Operative surgical treatments include open tendon repair and minimally invasive suturing techniques to restore the length and integrity of the torn tendon.\n\n【16】APPROACH TO：Achilles Tendon Rupture\n\n【17】THOMPSON TEST： With the patient in the prone position， the examiner， squeezes the posterior calf musculature . A positive Thompson test occurs when there is an absence of plantarflexion in the affected extremity. The disrupted musculotendinous unit is no longer able to plantarflex the foot on the affected side. This is compared with the unaffected side.\n\n【18】ECCENTRIC CONTRACTION： A muscular contraction during which muscle fibers actually elongate while firing due to overwhelming antagonistic forces. This occurs because the forces that the muscle is trying to overcome are greater than the force generated by the muscle body. Conversely， concentric contractions occur when the muscle body shortens with contraction. In concentric contractions， the force generated by the muscle is greater than the antagonistic forces applied to it.\n删除3：<u>Figure 34-1.

She is  删除换行 very worried about the impact it may have on surrounding brain tissue, citing evidence that  删除换行 it may reduce his IQ and make him infertile.

In this case, the father and mother share parental responsibility as they were  删除换行 married at the time of birth, and subsequent separation or divorce does not change this. \n\n【10】Although consent need only be obtained from one parent, it would be unreasonable and  删除换行 impracticable to proceed with a course of treatment as serious and prolonged as radiotherapy  删除换行 against the wishes of one parent without a declaration from the court.\n\n【11】The guiding principle for deciding whether to proceed with treatment must be the child’s best  删除换行 interests. In this case, Bodey J was clear in concluding that it was in the boy’s best interests to  删除换行 proceed with radiotherapy, given the evidence that his chances of survival would be drasti删除8：<u>￾</u>cally improved even at the risk of long term side effects, commenting that ‘one cannot enjoy  删除换行 even a diminished quality of life if one is not alive’. An interesting comparison can be made  删除换行 with a more recent case in which a 5-year-old boy with medulloblastoma was removed from  删除换行 a hospital by his parents and taken abroad because they wished him to have proton beam  删除换行 rather than conventional radiotherapy (Re Ashya King (A Child) 2014). In this case, greater  删除换行 importance was accorded to the rights of parents to decide their child’s treatment, given  删除换行 that a unit in Prague was willing to commence the alternative treatment immediately, even  删除换行 though it is not recommended in this country. As Baker J commented:\n\n【12】It is a fundamental principle of family law in this jurisdiction that responsibility for mak删除8：<u>￾</u>ing decisions about a child rests with his parents. In most cases, the parents are the best  删除换行 people to make decisions about a child and the State […] has no business interfering with  删除换行 the exercise of parental responsibility unless the child is suffering or is likely to suffer sig删除8：<u>￾</u>nificant harm.\n\n【13】Re Ashya King (A Child)删除5：<u> 2014</u>\nWhen parents oppose a strategy of treatment clinicians feel is necessary, the first question  删除换行 to answer is how urgent the situation is. In all non-emergency situations, an application  删除换行 should be made to the court if the situation cannot be resolved through further discussion. \n\n【14】The degree and likelihood of harm must be significant for parents’ decisions to be overruled:  删除换行 for example, parental refusal of immunisation is respected (Case 60), while medically  删除换行 necessary blood transfusions have been given by court order, against parental wishes.\n\n【15】Key Points\n\n【16】• Many disagreements between parents and clinicians can be overcome through  删除换行 a process of discussion and negotiation, but if this fails an application should be  删除换行 made to the court.\n\n【17】• Parents have the right to take decisions about their child’s healthcare, but this  删除换行 is not absolute: the presumption in favour of respecting their decision can be  删除换行 overruled if the child is at risk of significant harm.删除5：<u>45</u>\n删除22：<u>Ethics and Law in Clinical Practice: Children and Adolescents</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 14:23:14", "endTime": "2024/09/12 14:23:30", "cost": 16.497}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:30", "update_time": "2024-09-11 22:23:31", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 22:23:14"}

He was also more reclusive than normal but was eating and drinking well throughout the week. His diet consisted of nuts, fruits, and seeds. He was recently placed in a new cage 1 <sup>1 </sup> / <sub>2 </sub> weeks prior to presentation. A bird from a different household lived in the cage previously.\n\n【6】The parrot was previously treated with tetracycline that was placed in the water. This was followed by treatment using tylosin in the water for the past 5 days. The client felt that the bird showed mild improvement with the second antibiotic. The bird suddenly developed dyspnea and wheezing at which point the client presented him to the emergency hospital where he was maintained in supplemental oxygen overnight.﻿\n\n【7】Physical Examination Findings\n\n【8】On physical examination, the parrot exhibited open-mouth breathing and coughing. A 4 mm endotracheal tube was used for an air sac cannula that was immediately placed in the left abdominal air sac, which alleviated the bird's respiratory distress .\n\n【9】Once the bird was stable the physical examination was completed. The bird weighed 376 g and was in good body condition. A small amount of clear discharge was observed in both nares.\n删除3：<u>Fig. 55.1 . The Eclectus parrot with an air sac cannula in the left abdominal air sac.﻿</u>\n\n【10】Other Diagnostic Information during Initial Visit\n\n【11】Radiographs revealed no significant findings and the lungs and air sacs appeared normal. Considering the bird's remarkable improvement after placing the air sac cannula, a lesion in the syrinx was suspected and an exploratory surgery of the syrinx was performed.\n\n【12】The bird was given atropine (0.015 mg) and bu-torphanol (0.112 mg) intramuscularly as preanesthetic agents. Anesthesia induction was made 5 minutes later using sevoflurane into the air sac tube.\n\n【13】The surgical approach to the syrinx was made with the patient in dorsal recumbency. A 4-cm incision was made from the thoracic inlet in a cranial direction to expose the trachea and syrinx. The trachea was incised and a rigid arthroscope (1.9 mm) was used to better visualize the entire trachea and syrinx. A small, white, plaque was identified and removed from the ventral syrinx. An impression of the sample was taken for cytologic examination  and the remainder of the sample was submitted for culture and sensitivity. The trachea and subcutaneous tissue were closed with a 5-0 glycomer 631 suture separately, and the skin was closed with 4-0 nylon suture in a cruciate pattern.\n\n【14】The parrot recovered well from surgery and remained hospitalized for 4 days. Blood was collected for evaluation of the hemogram and a plasma biochemistry profile .﻿\n\n【15】Interpretive Discussion for the Initial Visit\n\n【16】A low-magnification image from the imprint of the material removed from the syrinx is shown in Fig. 55.2 . revealing a marked number of inflammatory cells and erythrocytes. Higher magnification  reveals that the majority of the inflammatory cells are nondegenerate heterophils. A few of the heterophils exhibit cytoplasmic vacuolization. Extracellular bacteria can be seen in the background.\n\n【17】The blood film revealed toxic changes in the majority of the heterophils . These changes are noted by the dark basophilic cytoplasm and the decreased amount of granules present in the cytoplasm. Hypochromatic erythrocytes are also present .\n删除3：<u>Fig. 55.2 .

This is likely a response to the inflammatory process in the syrinx. The plasma biochemistry panel revealed a marked increase in the aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and creatine kinase (CK) activities. The increased CK likely represents either skeletal muscle injury associated with the surgery or muscle exertion. The degree of increase in the AST likely indicates hepatocellular disease as it is too high to be associated with skeletal muscle involvement. A presumptive diagnosis of chlamydophilosis was made based on the evidence of a combination of hepatocellu-lar disease and respiratory disease.\n删除3：<u>Fig. 55.4 (a and b) The blood smear (Wright–Giemsa stain, 100x).</u>\n\n【19】Table 55.1 .

During this time, a swab from the choanal slit, conjunctiva, and cloaca was submitted for Chlamydophila poly-merase chain reaction (PCR) testing. The culture and the sensitivity obtained during surgery were pending at that time. As a precaution, the bird was treated with doxy-cycline (25 mg/kg PO BID), enrofloxacin (10 mg/kg PO BID), and meloxicam (0.5 mg/kg PO q 24 hours during hospitalization). He was also given enrofloxacin (8 mL of a 10 mg/mL enrofloxacin solution in 12 mL of saline) via 20-minute nebulization treatments twice daily.\n删除4：<u>Table 55.2 . Plasma biochemistry results.\n</u>\nThe microbial culture from the lesion in the syrinx revealed a moderate growth of Haemophilus species. The organism was susceptible to all antibiotics except tetracycline on the antibiotic sensitivity profile. Although the bacterium was resistant to tetracycline, doxycycline was continued as it is considered to be the antibiotic of choice for chlamydophilosis.\n\n【24】The bird's condition quickly improved and the air sac cannula was removed after 24 hours. During the course of 3 days of treatment, the bird appeared to be recovering from its respiratory distress; however, on the fourth day of treatment, the bird began sneezing and exhibiting open-mouth breathing with audible respiratory sounds and had developed a moderate amount of subcutaneous emphysema on his head, back, and chest. He continued to eat and drink and the skin incision was healing.\n\n【25】Blood was collected to reevaluate the plasma AST activity , and a tracheal aspirate was obtained for cytologic evaluation .

A second tracheal aspirate was evaluated 24 hours following initiation of the antifungal treatments .\n\n【29】Because of the continued presence of the fungal hyphae of the tracheal aspirate, clotrimazole was discontinued and replaced with amphotericin B owing to its fungicidal properties. The systemic itraconazole was continued. Amphotericin B (0.1 mL of 5 mg/mL) was combined with 0.9 mL of saline, of which 0.2 mL of the combination was directly applied into the trachea using a 5-French feeding tube. Another combination of amphotericin B (1 mL) and saline (4 mL) was used for nebulization twice daily. Nebulization with saline was also administered as needed.\n\n【30】The bird remained hospitalized for a total of 5 more days.

He continued to occasionally open-mouth breathe and exhibit respiratory noise, but these improved each day. Owing to financial concerns and the improvement of the parrot's overall condition, the client elected to continue treatment at home and the bird was discharged 5 days after the initiation of the amphotericin B treatments. The client was unable to continue the neb-ulization treatments at home. The bird was treated at home with itraconazole (10 mg/kg PO q 24 hours) and trimethoprim-sulfa (20 mg/kg PO BID) and was to return in 2 weeks for reevaluation.\n删除3：<u>Fig. 55.6 .

Symptoms tend to be characterized by the fear of committing inappropriate or improper sexual acts or gestures such as, “I will get my mother pregnant,” or “I will sexually molest a child or adolescent.” Sexual obsessions can be related to fear of one’s own behavior, as the examples just provided, or others’ behavior, such as repetitively obsessing about others’ sexual viability or practices (e.g. “Is my wife cheating on me?”). Resembling other nonsexual obsessions , the thoughts are unwanted, distressing, and viewed as unreasonable. However, some clinical distinctions between sexual and nonsexual obsessions exist. Most notably, the fear caused by sexual obsessions comes more from the internal interpretation of the occurrence/content of the thought (e.g. feelings of immorality, insanity) rather than the reality of the external world 删除10：<u>(e.g. every door knob has feces on it; Aardema et al. 2013 ; Aardema and O’Connor 2007 )</u>. Additionally, sexual obsessions may be more time consuming and impairing than other domains 删除10：<u>(Williams and Farris 2011 )</u>.\n\n【31】Sexual compulsions are behaviors one may engage in to temporarily alleviate anxiety related to the sexual obsession because the individual wants to rid themselves of these unwanted thoughts. When compulsions are present, they may manifest as an overt observable behavior or as a covert mental ritual. Some examples of overt and covert sexual compulsions include asking others for reassurance to disprove the distressing sexual thought (overt), checking for self-arousal (overt), reciting prayers (covert), or counting (covert). Avoidance and mental rituals are two compulsions that are challenging to recognize clinically but commonly occur in response to sexual intrusive thoughts. An individual may also attempt to avoid situations that trigger the sexual thoughts or conduct mental compulsions that may provide self-reassurance or be believed to “counter” the unwanted thought. Often no sexual compulsions will be reported, but further probing by the clinician will reveal that these patients engage in mental/behavioral avoidance or mental rituals 删除10：<u>(Abramowitz et al. 2003 )</u>. Sexual compulsions differ from other nonsexual compulsive behaviors by being more oriented towards thought-control techniques rather than behavioral coping strategies that are implemented to circumvent feared consequences 删除10：<u>(Lee and Kwon 2003 )</u>. Identifying the function of certain sexual behaviors (e.g. masturbation) is also clinically important. If they occur in response to an anxiety-producing intrusive thought and provide a temporary reduction in anxiety, they likely are compulsions; however, clinicians should also assess if they are instead occurring in response to an intense unwanted urge (i.e. impulse control disorder) or desire for sexual pleasure 删除10：<u>(e.g. hypersexuality; Kafka 2010 )</u>. The phenomological difference between impulsive behavior and compulsive behavior can be challenging and is beyond the scope of this chapter (see Grant and Potenza 通用删除7(英):<u>( 2006 )</u> for an illustrative case vignette and review of the literature on this topic).\n\n【32】An area that can pose difficulty for mental health professionals and medical providers is discriminating between OCD and paraphilias 删除10：<u>(American Psychiatric Association 2013 )</u>, especially since intrusive sexual thoughts regarding children can occur in adult OCD 删除10：<u>(Goodman et al. 1989a )</u>. In terms of pedophilia, the individual with pedophilia may not experience negative feelings about sexual thoughts about children. In fact, they may experience sexual pleasure and arousal from their sexual thoughts as well as relief from sexual acts relating to their sexual thoughts at some point in their life 删除10：<u>(Gordon 2002 ; Gordon and Grubin 2004 )</u>. Pedophiles may even justify their behavior by attributing their behavior to the child or claiming that the child found pleasure in their behavior or wanted the behavior to occur. This is very distinct from OCD, where individuals describe the intrusive thoughts about children as very emotionally distressing and inconsistent with their self-concept. In short, sexual cognitions in those with pedophilia present as ego-syntonic, whereas sexual cognitions about children in OCD present as ego-dystonic 删除10：<u>(Aardema et al. 2013 )</u>. In addition to the emotional response to the cognition, it is also crucial to take into consideration the patient’s sexual history, presence of other obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and if the individual intends to willingly act on the sexual thoughts.\n\n【33】When differentiating between obsessive-compulsive symptoms and a patient’s uncertainty about their sexual orientation, therapists should use a similar set of procedures outlined above (e.g. determining if thoughts are ego-syntonic vs. ego-dystonic). For those who are negotiating their sexual orientation, they may experience sexual fantasies, arousal, or masturbate when thinking about others who are of the same sex. Their fears related to homosexuality may be based in reality such as concerns about how their family or society will respond to their sexual orientation. While an individual with OCD may identify as being homosexual, they tend to not report intrusive and persistent unwanted thoughts related to being homosexual 删除10：<u>(Williams and Farris 2011 )</u>. For a heterosexual individual with OCD, they have a tendency to engage in thought–action fusion (TAF) about homosexuality 删除10：<u>(Shafran et al. 1996 )</u>, which is the notion that experiencing an intrusive cognition is equivalent to actually engaging in a feared behavior. For example, the mere act of having a thought about being homosexual must mean that they are in fact attracted to people of the same sex. Thus, those with OCD want to rid themselves of these thoughts and engage in behaviors to reassure themselves that they are heterosexual. These individuals do not report an urge or desire to engage in homosexual behavior 删除10：<u>(Gordon 2002 ; O’Neil et al. 2005 )</u>.\n\n【34】OCD is commonly treated with psychotherapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with exposure and response prevention, and/or psychopharmacological interventions, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). CBT is where the patient is exposed to a fear/distress-provoking stimulus while any distress-reducing responses are prevented. These exposures occur throughout treatment and are conducted in a hierarchal manner; patients start with lower anxiety-producing challenges that get progressively more challenging. Through these challenges, clinicians aim to help their patient’s reduce avoidance of fear-provoking stimuli and learn cognitive strategies to utilize in response to intrusive cognitions. This approach has been shown by numerous studies to be an efficacious treatment for OCD 删除10：<u>(e.g. Olatunji et al. 2013 )</u>.\n\n【35】The implementation of this treatment can be difficult when treating sexual obsessions and compulsions, as therapists’ own anxiety or negative beliefs about CBT 删除10：<u>(Deacon et al. 2013 ; Farrell et al. 2013 )</u> could cause them to avoid certain sexual content, conduct exposures inappropriately, or even avoid exposures altogether. In fact, despite being the first-line treatment for OCD (see Jordan et al. 通用删除7(英):<u>( 2012 )</u> for a review), CBT is estimated to be utilized in only 30 % of treatment provided by community clinicians for adults with OCD 删除10：<u>(e.g. Hipol and Deacon 2013 )</u>. Community clinicians likely avoid CBT for OCD because of unjustified ethical concerns 删除10：<u>(Olatunji et al. 2009 )</u>, lack of training 删除10：<u>(Hipol and Deacon 2013 )</u>, and their own anxiety or disgust sensitivity 删除10：<u>(Deacon et al. 2013 ; Olatunji et al. 2009 )</u>. Unfortunately, all of these factors amplify interference in the treatment of sexual obsessions or compulsions as therapists must be willing to discuss sexually explicit content and conduct exposures that are challenging to design and implement due to their sexual nature. Taken together, it is not surprising that sexual (as well as religious) obsessions and compulsions have worse response to behavioral treatment than other domains such as harm, contamination, and symmetry 删除10：<u>(Mataix-Cols et al. 2002 )</u> in adult OCD.\n\n【36】Description of the Presenting Problem in the Particular Case That Will Be Presented\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【37】In order to illustrate CBT treatment for an adult with sexual obsessions and compulsions, a discussion of a difficult but ultimately successful case of an African American male in his early 30s who self-referred to our clinic is presented. For the sake of confidentiality and adherence to the American Psychological Association Ethics Code and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) guidelines on privacy, the patient will be referred to as Kyle (pseudonym), and several noncritical details about this case have been altered. Kyle presented to the clinic after prompting from his wife.\n\n【38】Kyle arrived for an intake session alone. Kyle reported that his obsessive-compulsive symptoms were distressing and caused substantial impairment in his personal and social life, thus he desired to seek psychological and/or psychopharmacological treatment for his symptoms. He was polite throughout the intake, although was notably anxious and responded to questions directly, with minimal elaboration or details. When this was processed by the therapist, it was apparent that Kyle had low expectations about the ability of treatment to help improve his symptoms. He also conveyed that he has difficulty discussing his symptoms with strangers because “it can sound really odd.”\n\n【39】In order to properly assess Kyle’s obsessions and compulsions, the Yale–Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) and Dimensional Yale–Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (DYBOCS) were administered at intake. The YBOCS was given to assess total obsessive-compulsive symptom severity 删除10：<u>(Goodman et al. 1989a )</u>, and the DYBOCS was given to assess dimensional severity 删除10：<u>(Rosario-Campos et al. 2006 )</u>. As is common with pediatric or adult OCD, Kyle’s presenting symptoms involved multiple symptom domains 删除10：<u>(Rasmussen and Eisen 1987 )</u>. Kyle’s obsessions were in the sexual, harm, and contamination dimensions. Specifically, Kyle was concerned with aggressively harming others, hitting others with his car, and contracting illnesses from blood-contaminated materials. Compulsions related to the obsessions listed above were primarily excessive hand washing, checking stoves and locks, and avoidance (e.g. of the color red, driving, needles).\n\n【40】Initially, Kyle denied any sexual-related obsessions or compulsions until the DYBOCS was administered, where he briefly described severe sexual obsessive-compulsive symptoms. However, by session six of treatment , Kyle began to discuss his sexual obsessions and compulsions openly and was willing to target these symptoms in treatment. Although not discussed in detail at the intake, Kyle later rated his sexual obsessive-compulsive symptoms as his most severe problem that caused the most impairment. Kyle’s sexual obsessions were primarily that he was physically attracted to children, that he would act on this attraction, and that he was a “bad person” for having these obsessions. Sexual compulsions were primarily avoidance of children (especially his niece) and “counter thoughts” where Kyle actively thought of attractive women to assure himself that he was not attracted to children.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 11:34:41", "endTime": "2024/09/12 11:35:56", "cost": 75.235}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:30", "update_time": "2024-09-11 19:35:57", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 19:34:41"}

What is the treatment?删除7：<u> 246 100 Cases in Clinical Pathology and Laboratory Medicine </u>\n\n【27】ANSWERS\n\n【28】The differential diagnosis of a prolonged fever is broad, with main categories split into infectious \n\n【29】(e.g. tuberculosis, Lyme disease), malignancy (e.g. lymphoma, leukaemia, or solid tumours)  删除换行 and inflammatory diseases (e.g. systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE], rheumatoid arthritis). \n\n【30】Pertinent infectious causes with localising signs include infective endocarditis (IE), osteomyeli删除8：<u>￾</u>tis, abscess, urinary tract infection, meningitis and cholangitis. In this case the clearly raised  删除换行 inflammatory markers (CRP, WBC) and high fever suggest an infectious cause is more proba删除8：<u>￾</u>ble. The petechiae suggest a systemic process of infection or vasculitis but may be due to trauma  删除换行 from a fall, although their distribution on the body makes this unlikely. There are findings on  删除换行 examination and investigations suggesting the source may be from the heart (endocarditis) or  删除换行 the shoulder. The findings of the echocardiogram make IE the most likely diagnosis. \n\n【31】IE is an infection of the inner lining of the heart, the endocardium. This includes the heart  删除换行 valves, their supporting structures, intraventricular septa and the walls of the heart, as well as  删除换行 any intracardiac foreign bodies, such as prosthetic valves or pacemaker wires. \n\n【32】Two factors are necessary for bacterial colonisation of a valve to take place: \n\n【33】1. Valvular damage: This can occur from turbulent blood flow, congenital heart  删除换行 disease, prosthetic valves, previous endocarditis, physical manipulation, the  删除换行 particulate material of intravenous drug user’s injections and degeneration. \n\n【34】Degenerative valves make the incidence of IE three times higher in the elderly  删除换行 population. \n\n【35】2. An inflammatory reaction to the exposed and damaged valvular endothelium  删除换行 results in the deposition of platelets and fibrin. Circulating bacterial colonies grow  删除换行 on these platelet-fibrin clots, becoming trapped in the vegetation and protected from  删除换行 phagocytic cells and resistant to other immune defences. \n\n【36】In the general population left-sided valves are predominantly affected, most often the mitral  删除换行 valve. Right-sided valve involvement forms less than 10% of IE and has a lower mortality  删除换行 than left-sided disease. Right-sided IE is more common to cohorts of intravenous drug users,  删除换行 congenital heart disease, and in patients with pacemakers. \n\n【37】The type of pathogen likely to cause IE can be determined based on factors such as the  删除换行 patient’s age, source of infection, valve location and type (native or prosthetic) and whether  删除换行 the presentation is acute or subacute. Gram-positive organisms such as Staphylococcus  删除换行 aureus, Streptococcus viridans and enterococci are responsible for most native valve infections. \n\n【38】Coagulase-negative staphylococci more commonly cause prosthetic valve endocarditis \n\n【39】(PVE). S. aureus causes acute IE, destroying the valve quickly, with a mortality rate of 30%. \n\n【40】This organism is typically seen on the tricuspid valve of intravenous drug users. Staphylococcus  删除换行 epidermidis commonly affects prosthetic valves within 2 months of surgery. S. viridans is a  删除换行 more low-virulence organism associated with dental procedures presenting in a subacute  删除换行 manner. Streptococcus bovis is associated with IE in those patients with colorectal carcinoma. \n\n【41】Fungal IE can occur in immunosuppressed patients, IV drug users and prosthetic valves. \n\n【42】A causative organism will be identified in 90% of cases if two separate sets of blood cultures  删除换行 are taken 30 minutes apart. It is imperative to take blood cultures before antibiotics are started,  删除换行 which was not done in this scenario. Antibiotics are the leading cause of negative blood cul删除8：<u>￾</u>tures. Another cause is intermittent shedding; therefore culture must be taken when there is  删除换行 a fever. Other causes of culture-negative endocarditis include the fastidious Gram-negative  删除换行 bacteria of the HACEK group (Haemophilus, Aggregatibacter, Cardiobacterium, Eikenella, Kingella), Case 81: Fever and Collapse 247 \n\n【43】Coxiella burnetii (Q fever) and Bartonella spp. Each of these three groups is responsible for up to  删除换行 3% of endocarditis in England and Wales. \n\n【44】All patients with suspected IE must have a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), which  删除换行 detects valvular vegetations with a sensitivity of approximately 70–80%. If this is negative  删除换行 or there is still a high index of clinical suspicion, a transoesophageal echocardiogram (TOE)  删除换行 is indicated, which has a sensitivity of 90–100%. If a prosthetic valve or intracardiac device  删除换行 is present, a TOE is strongly recommended, as the sensitivity of the TTE is low. A follow-up  删除换行 echocardiogram is required at the end of antibiotic treatment to assess valve and cardiac  删除换行 function. \n\n【45】The mainstay of treatment is 4–6 weeks of high-dose IV antibiotics. About 50% of patients  删除换行 will require surgical intervention to remove the infected area, as host defences in heart valves  删除换行 are relatively ineffective. Reasons for surgical intervention are divided into three broad  删除换行 groups: \n\n【46】1. Uncontrolled infection (not responding to antibiotic therapy, a perivalvular abscess, \n\n【47】PVE, most Gram-negative and fungal IE) \n\n【48】2.

S. aureus causes acute IE, destroying the valve quickly, with a mortality rate of 30%. \n\n【40】This organism is typically seen on the tricuspid valve of intravenous drug users. Staphylococcus  删除换行 epidermidis commonly affects prosthetic valves within 2 months of surgery. S. viridans is a  删除换行 more low-virulence organism associated with dental procedures presenting in a subacute  删除换行 manner. Streptococcus bovis is associated with IE in those patients with colorectal carcinoma. \n\n【41】Fungal IE can occur in immunosuppressed patients, IV drug users and prosthetic valves. \n\n【42】A causative organism will be identified in 90% of cases if two separate sets of blood cultures  删除换行 are taken 30 minutes apart. It is imperative to take blood cultures before antibiotics are started,  删除换行 which was not done in this scenario. Antibiotics are the leading cause of negative blood cul删除8：<u>￾</u>tures. Another cause is intermittent shedding; therefore culture must be taken when there is  删除换行 a fever. Other causes of culture-negative endocarditis include the fastidious Gram-negative  删除换行 bacteria of the HACEK group (Haemophilus, Aggregatibacter, Cardiobacterium, Eikenella, Kingella), Case 81: Fever and Collapse <mark>247</mark> \n\n【43】Coxiella burnetii (Q fever) and Bartonella spp. Each of these three groups is responsible for up to  删除换行 3% of endocarditis in England and Wales. \n\n【44】All patients with suspected IE must have a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), which  删除换行 detects valvular vegetations with a sensitivity of approximately 70–80%. If this is negative  删除换行 or there is still a high index of clinical suspicion, a transoesophageal echocardiogram (TOE)  删除换行 is indicated, which has a sensitivity of 90–100%. If a prosthetic valve or intracardiac device  删除换行 is present, a TOE is strongly recommended, as the sensitivity of the TTE is low. A follow-up  删除换行 echocardiogram is required at the end of antibiotic treatment to assess valve and cardiac  删除换行 function. \n\n【45】The mainstay of treatment is 4–6 weeks of high-dose IV antibiotics. About 50% of patients  删除换行 will require surgical intervention to remove the infected area, as host defences in heart valves  删除换行 are relatively ineffective. Reasons for surgical intervention are divided into three broad  删除换行 groups: \n\n【46】1. Uncontrolled infection (not responding to antibiotic therapy, a perivalvular abscess, \n\n【47】PVE, most Gram-negative and fungal IE) \n\n【48】2.

Mott Children’s Hospital, Ann Arbor, MI, USA\n\n【3】A 3‐month‐old female, admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with complex congenital heart disease and chronic respiratory failure, develops new‐onset symptoms of respiratory distress.History of Present Illness\n--------------------------\n\n【4】She was admitted to the hospital following birth due to complex congenital heart disease including dextrotransposition of the great arteries. Patient underwent arterial switch procedure at day 3 of life and required venous–arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA‐ECMO) immediately following procedure for 6 days due to low cardiac output. Patient has had persistent ventilator requirement with inability to wean ventilatory support. Discussion between primary team, pediatric otolaryngology service, and family resulted in decision to proceed with tracheostomy due to need for long‐term mechanical ventilation. Tracheostomy was completed 4 days ago by pediatric otolaryngology, without complication.Past Medical History\n--------------------\n\n【5】She was born at 37 weeks with prenatal diagnosis of dextrotransposition of the great arteries to 30‐year‐old gravida 1 para 1 mother by cesarean section. Apgar scores were 6 and 9 following birth. She was initially placed on oxygen per nasal cannula at birth that was transitioned to nasal continuous positive airway pressure support at a few hours of life due to increased work of breathing. She received prostaglandin E infusion until arterial switch procedure at day 3 of life. Patient was intubated by anesthesia with 3.0 cuffed oral endotracheal tube for arterial switch operation and reported to be grade 1 view. Patient’s postoperative course was complicated by need for VA‐ECMO, and sternal wound infection for which she is receiving 6‐week intravenous antibiotic course.Past Surgical History\n---------------------\n\n【6】She had an arterial switch operation and VA‐ECMO cannulation at day 3 of life. She underwent ECMO decannulation 6 days later and had subsequent delayed sternal closure. She had tracheostomy completed 4 days ago at 3 months of age.Family History\n--------------\n\n【7】Her father has a history of asthma. Her mother’s family history is negative.Current Status\n--------------\n\n【8】She is in the PICU and has been hemodynamically stable following tracheostomy procedure. She is receiving sedation infusions of midazolam, dexmedetomidine, and morphine that are being administered through a peripherally inserted central catheter. She is ordered to have bedrest and limited movement due to risk for accidental decannulation. She has a 3.5 neonatal cuffed tracheostomy tube in place. Stay sutures are intact, labeled, and taped to the chest . Nurse has been suctioning tracheostomy tube every 2 hours for a small amount of thin white secretions. She is on the ventilator in pressure control/assist control mode with rate 30 breaths per minute, positive end‐expiratory pressure (PEEP) 10 cmH <sub>2 </sub> O, peak inspiratory pressure 32 cmH <sub>2 </sub> O, and F i O <sub>2 </sub> 0.3. She is breathing comfortably with stable venous blood gases. Oxygen saturations are currently 99% on the ventilator. Lung sounds are slightly coarse bilaterally. Figure 24.2 shows the most recent chest radiograph. She is receiving a milrinone infusion as recent echocardiogram demonstrated moderately diminished left ventricular function. Emergency tracheostomy supply bag is at bedside including same size and size smaller tracheostomy tubes. Pediatric otolaryngology is planning to complete the first trach change in 3 days.\n删除3：<u>Figure 24.1 Patient with stay sutures in place.</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 24.2 Chest radiography with tracheostomy tube in place.</u>\n\n【9】You are called to the bedside by the nurse because of the patient’s increased work of breathing and hypoxia, which occurred acutely after she received a bath and the bedsheets were changed. When you arrive at the bedside, she appears to have increased work of breathing with subcostal retractions and nasal flaring. She is also noted to have mottling of her skin. Oxygen saturations are now 85% and the ventilator alarm is sounding.Questions\n---------\n\n【10】Answer the following questions using the details provided.\n\n【11】1.  What emergency supplies should be immediately available for a patient status post tracheostomy?\n2.  What is the purpose of stay sutures in a postoperative tracheostomy patient?\n3.  Based on this information, what are the possible differential diagnoses for sudden respiratory distress for this patient?\n4.  What factors are important to assess during your physical examination for these potential differential diagnoses?Rationale and Evidence‐based Practice Explanation\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】### What emergency supplies should be immediately available for a patient status post tracheostomy?\n\n【13】Emergency supplies to replace the tracheostomy tube should always be immediately available to tracheostomy patients. This includes the same size tracheostomy tube and the size smaller tracheostomy tube in case there is difficulty placing the same size tracheostomy tube. Other needed supplies include trach ties, water‐based lubricant, scissors, hemostats, suction catheters, suction apparatus, and bag valve mask. An appropriately sized oral endotracheal tube should also be accessible.\n\n【14】### What is the purpose of stay sutures in a postoperative tracheostomy patient?\n\n【15】Stay suture placement is a surgical technique where non‐absorbable sutures are placed adjacent to the tracheal incision at the third and fourth cartilage rings, so that they could be pulled to open the stoma and bring the trachea closer to the skin if there was accidental dislodgement of the tracheostomy tube. These are taped to the chest and labeled “right” and “left” so that they do not inadvertently get crossed if being used. These sutures are removed at the time of the first trach change.\n\n【16】### Based on this information, what are the possible differential diagnoses for sudden respiratory distress for this patient?\n\n【17】Possible major postoperative complications for pediatric tracheostomy patients can include bleeding, occlusion of tracheostomy tube most commonly by inspissated secretions, and accidental decannulation. If a child with a tracheostomy develops respiratory distress (typically acute in nature), it is important to assess for these conditions. Pneumothorax is also a risk factor with a tracheostomy procedure. Respiratory and cardiac reasons, and mechanical failure of the ventilator also need to be included as part of the differential diagnosis of this patient.\n\n【18】### What factors are important to assess during your physical examination for these potential differential diagnoses?\n\n【19】It is important to immediately assess the patient’s neck to ensure that the tracheostomy tube is in place. Crepitus from misdirected air into subcutaneous tissues can be ascertained by simple palpation. Suctioning of the tracheostomy tube should also be performed to evaluate for secretions in the tube and easy passage of the suction catheter through the tracheostomy tube. After these have been assessed, proceed with the remainder of the physical examination, including assessment of the heart, auscultation of the chest to ensure bilateral breath sounds, and checking vent tubing from patient to machine.\n\n【20】Continuation of case : On physical examination, assessment of the tracheostomy site shows that the tracheostomy tube is decannulated from the trachea, though the tracheostomy ties remain secured around the neck. The stoma is slightly open and stay sutures are still intact. Patient is continuing to have increased work of breathing, with worsening subcostal retractions and cyanosis. Oxygen saturations continue to decrease to 70%. The pediatric otolaryngology team is paged stat to the bedside. The nurse removes the trach ties so that the neck is visible and there is access to the stoma. The respiratory therapist begins bag‐mask ventilation of the patient, while the nurse covers the stoma with gauze to make it occlusive. There is good chest rise and oxygen saturations slowly increase to 84%. Patient’s color is still slightly cyanotic, but slowly improving. You begin to prepare for replacing the tracheostomy tube and the pediatric otolaryngology team arrives at the bedside. They state that they will now be managing the airway for clarity to the providers in the room. They take the same size trach tube and hemostats from the patient’s emergency supply bag. The right and left stay sutures are lifted up from the chest in a V formation to hold the edges of the stoma open. The same size trach tube is inserted with minimal difficulty and the patient is placed back on the ventilator. Trach ties are secured. Oxygen saturations are now 93%. Bilateral breath sounds are confirmed. Pediatric otolaryngology completes a bedside tracheobronchoscopy examination after patient is placed on 100% oxygen and confirms that the tracheostomy tube is appropriately positioned in the trachea . The patient’s color is now pink and F i O <sub>2 </sub> has been quickly decreased to 50% with oxygen saturations 98%.\n删除3：<u>Figure 24.3 Image from tracheobronchoscopy: carina is visualized with right and left mainstem bronchi.</u>\n\n【21】1.  What maneuvers could be used immediately to help with ventilation of this patient?\n2.  What are the options for securing an airway in this patient?\n3.  Why is it important to confirm that the tracheostomy tube is in place following decannulation in an un‐established airway? What methods can be used to confirm placement?\n\n【22】### What maneuvers could be used immediately to help with ventilation of this patient?\n\n【23】If patients with tracheostomy tube decannulation are not demonstrating adequate respiratory drive, they can receive bag‐mask ventilation to help with oxygenation while attempts are made to replace the trach tube. Patients without upper airway issues that exclude them from being intubated or bagged from above can receive bag‐mask ventilation with the tracheostomy stoma being covered with gauze to make it occlusive. If the stoma is not covered, the air will leak out and the patient cannot receive appropriate ventilation. Certain upper airway anomalies or surgical procedures (e.g. surgical history of laryngotracheal separation) do not allow patients to be bagged from above, and would require bagging through the trach stoma. This involves placing the mask over the stoma with a tight seal and bagging the patient to achieve adequate chest rise. If the patient is stable and has adequate respiratory drive, bagging is not necessary while preparing to replace the tracheostomy tube.\n\n【24】### What are the options for securing an airway in this patient?\n\n【25】Foreknowledge of the patient’s airway is important because the team can then determine whether the patient can be bagged from above in an emergency or whether the patient needs to be bagged through the trach stoma. If the tracheostomy tube cannot be replaced, the patient should be orally intubated as long as there is no upper airway obstruction that would exclude this as an option.\n\n【26】### Why is it important to confirm that the tracheostomy tube is in place following decannulation in an un‐established airway? What methods can be used to confirm placement?\n\n【27】Appropriate placement of the tracheostomy tube is imperative in order to achieve adequate ventilation and to have a secure airway. False passage is a possible risk factor in placing a tracheostomy tube, especially in a stoma that is not yet established. Physical examination findings confirming that the tracheostomy tube is appropriately placed include assessing for bilateral equal breath sounds and symmetric chest rise with respirations. Presence of humidification of the trach tube, and monitoring of end‐tidal carbon dioxide if available, can also help to demonstrate correct placement. Tracheobronchoscopy allows direct visualization past the distal end of the tracheostomy tube to confirm appropriate positioning in the trachea by visualizing the wall of the trachea, carina, and mainstem bronchi.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 14:27:18", "endTime": "2024/09/12 14:27:41", "cost": 22.3}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:30", "update_time": "2024-09-11 22:27:41", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 22:27:18"}

LDL\n\n【6】Answer: 35.1 A . This patient presents with classical symptoms of hypertriglyceridemia: milky plasma, eruptive xanthomas, enlarged liver and spleen, and symptoms of pancreatitis. The milky plasma is due to abnormally high chylomicron levels, indicating that TG is not being removed from the transporter of dietary TG and it is accumulating in the plasma. The other lipoproteins listed have low levels of TG are much smaller and would not be expected to lead to milky plasma if elevated.\n\n【7】Question: 35.2 Laboratory results for a patient with uncontrolled type 1 diabetes mellitus reveal hyperglycemia (634 mg/dL) and hypertriglyceridemia (498 mg/dL). The most likely cause of the hypertriglyceridemia in this patient is which of the following?\n\n【8】A. Deficiency in apoprotein C-II\n\n【9】B. Increased hepatic triglyceride synthesis\n\n【10】C. Decreased lipoprotein lipase activity\n\n【11】D. Deficiency in LDL receptors\n\n【12】E. Absence of hormone sensitive lipase\n\n【13】Answer: 35.2 C . Decreased lipoprotein lipase activity is the result of the failure of the pancreatic β cells to produce and secrete insulin. Insulin stimulates the synthesis of lipoprotein lipase; in the absence of insulin, lipoprotein lipase activity in the capillary beds is low. While a deficiency in apoC-II would also lead to hypertriglyceridemia, this genetic defect is rare. If a patient with type I diabetes mellitus is not given insulin, then the increased glucagon–insulin ratio would stimulate gluconeogenesis and β oxidation in the liver rather than synthesis of triglycerides. Neither a deficiency of LDL receptors nor hormone-sensitive lipase would be expected to increase circulating TG levels.\n\n【14】Question: 35.3 A 25-year-old woman was referred to a lipid research center for investigation of moderate hypertriglyceridemia because the plasma lipid and lipoprotein profiles showed abnormalities. Both HDL and LDL were more buoyant and showed elevations in TG content with the mass of TG approximately the same as that of cholesterol. A deficiency in which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient’s lipid abnormality?\n\n【15】A. Lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase\n\n【16】B. Lipoprotein lipase\n\n【17】C. Apoprotein C-II\n\n【18】D. Hepatic lipase\n\n【19】E. Apoprotein B-100\nAnswer: 35.3 D . Hepatic lipase. The abnormal buoyancies of the LDL and HDL fractions due to their increased TG content indicate that IDL is not being processed to LDL and HDL is not being remodeled. Both of these processes are accomplished by hepatic lipase. A deficiency in lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase would lead to elevated serum cholesterol levels, almost all as free cholesterol. Deficiencies in lipoprotein lipase or apoC-II would lead to hypertriglyceridemia as increased chylomicrons and/or VLDL. An apoB-100 deficiency would lead to increased levels of LDL, but they would have the normal TG/cholesterol ratio.\n\n【20】BIOCHEMISTRY PEARLS\n\n【21】 TGs are safely transported in the bloodstream packaged into lipoproteins called chylomicrons or VLDLs.\n\n【22】 The most common genetic defect leading to hypertriglyceridemia is a deficiency in lipoprotein lipase, which results in increased levels of both chylomicrons and VLDL.\n\n【23】 Individuals who are homozygous for the defective gene for lipoprotein lipase usually present with symptoms of chylomicronemia (TG levels > 2000 mg/dL, abdominal pain, pancreatitis, xanthomas, lipemia retinalis) in childhood.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 14:27:03", "endTime": "2024/09/12 14:27:14", "cost": 10.962}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:30", "update_time": "2024-09-11 22:27:14", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 22:27:03"}

Haloperidol (Haldol)\n\n【5】E. Levodopa\n\n【6】Answer: 55.1 D . The clinical scenario described is associated with Tourette syndrome. A variety of drugs may help suppress the tics that are characteristic of this syndrome. These include haloperidol, pimozide, trifluoperazine, and fluphenazine. Antiepileptics such as carbamazepine and phenytoin are not useful. Levodopa is the drug of choice in treating advanced PD. Trihexyphenidyl and benz-tropine are useful in suppressing the parkinsonism that may develop with haloperidol administration, but are not useful in the management of Tourette syndrome.\n\n【7】Question: 55.2 A 21-year-old woman develops auditory hallucinations and persecutory delusions over the course of 3 days. She was hospitalized and started on haloperidol 2 mg three times daily. Within a week of treatment, she developed stooped posture and a shuffling gait. Her head was slightly tremulous and her movements became slowed. Her medication was changed to thioridazine (Mellaril), and trihexyphenidyl (Artane) was added.

The patient is suffering from dyskinesias from too much levodopa/carbidopa. Stopping levodopa/carbidopa is usually not an option for most patients; however, a reduction of the medication would be of the most benefit to her.

Severe oedema 删除换行 of venous origin is invariably related to the deep vein disease.\n\n【2】The clinical outcome of the deep vein disease varies with  删除换行 the segment of the venous tree involved. Grossly swollen  删除换行 limb is usually associated with upper segment or  删除换行 iliofemoral vein pathology. The initial lesion is thrombus  删除换行 formation. Acute obstruction produced by rapidly  删除换行 developing thrombosis, particularly in the iliofemoral  删除换行 segment, will produce severe swelling. As the venous  删除换行 collateral circulation develops this swelling gradually  删除换行 subsides. Recanalisation of the thrombosed segment later  删除换行 on takes place and during this time the limb remains  删除换行 comfortable. When the latter process is complete, the  删除换行 previously thrombosed segment will regain patency but  删除换行 the valves are permanently destroyed. This leads to venous  删除换行 hypertension and oedema formation.\n\n【3】Deep vein thrombosis affecting lower segment or calf  删除换行 veins may not produce a big swelling. The principal lesion  删除换行 here is the incompetence of valves in the perforating  删除换行 veins. Minor oedema occur in these cases in the lower  删除换行 third of the leg and foot. But of greater significance are  删除换行 the changes produced in the local tissues exposed to the \n\n【4】'high pressure leak' due to the calf muscle pump. Skin  删除换行 atrophy and subcutaneous fibrosis may develop which will  删除换行 gradually lead to chronic ulceration and this is the most  删除换行 constant feature of postphlebitic syndrome. The medial  删除换行 group of perforating veins are usually constant and it is  删除换行 the skin above the medial malleolus that suffers most in  删除换行 perforating vein disease.\n\n【5】Clinical features.—\n\n【6】Severe oedema of venous origin is invariably related  删除换行 to deep vein disease. The history and clinical picture  删除换行 vary according to the segment of the venous tree involved.\n\n【7】Iliofemoral thrombosis.— This starts with an acute  删除换行 onset with rapid development of painful swelling from  删除换行 groin to foot. This condition is classically seen (i) in 删除换行 puerperium (phlegmasia alba dolens), (ii) in the  删除换行 postoperative patient, (iii) in bedfast medical patient, (iv)  删除换行 in patients with contraceptive pills or (iv) with latent  删除换行 carcinoma.\n\n【8】If the entire iliofemoral segment is involved, the limb  删除换行 is quickly swollen and cyanotic. There may be fever and  删除换行 tachycardia. Localised tenderness may be present in the  删除换行 groin over the femoral vein.\n\n【9】'Phlegmasia cerulea dolens' is the most severe form of  删除换行 iliofemoral thrombosis and is the result of almost total  删除换行 outflow obstruction. Gross swelling develops rapidly and  删除换行 the limbs become dusky cyanotic in colour with patches  删除换行 of cutaneous gangrene. Arterial pulses are impalpable due  删除换行 to oedema.\n\n【10】With lesser degrees of iliofemoral thrombosis a  删除换行 satisfactory venous collateral circulation gradually develops  删除换行 and the swelling comes down within a few weeks,  删除换行 although the limb may become uncomfortable with  删除换行 exercise.\n\n【11】Recanalisation of the occluded segment may become  删除换行 complete after a considerable interval and by then the  删除换行 valvular competence is permanently destroyed. At this stage  删除换行 swelling again worsens and the symptoms of venous  删除换行 hypertension become evident.\n\n【12】Iliac vein compression.— Oedema may be produced  删除换行 by anatomical compression of the left common iliac vein  删除换行 by the right common iliac artery. Some authors have  删除换行 also described bands and webs within the lumen of the  删除换行 left common iliac vein. Phlebography will diagnose either  删除换行 compression or intraluminal abnormalities.\n\n【13】Lower segment thrombosis.— Deep vein thrombosis in  删除换行 the calf veins is a very common complication of the  删除换行 postoperative period. But in this condition swellng is  删除换行 usually minimal. Pulmonary embolisation may result in  删除换行 this thrombosis. But destruction of the valves in the  删除换行 perforating veins is the main feature of postphlebitic  删除换行 syndrome which may develop at a considerable time  删除换行 interval from the initial thrombotic incident. Due to  删除换行 incompetent perforating veins in the lower third of the  删除换行 leg, the subcutaneous tissue and skin in this area become  删除换行 exposed to 'high pressure leak' from the calf muscle pump. \n\n【14】The result is venous ulceration which is the real problem  删除换行 and not the swelling.\n\n【15】Special Investigations.—\n\n【16】Before radiology of the venous system is taken, the  删除换行 patient must be put to bed with high elevation of the  删除换行 limb. A diuretic such as frusemide, should be given. In  删除换行 this way the degree of swelling is reduced considerably  删除换行 within a few days. If the aetiology of the swelling cannot  删除换行 be found out, it is better to do the phlebograhy first,  删除换行 followed by lymphangiography.SWOLLEN LEG 189\n\n【17】Phlebography.— Injection of radio-opaque dye into an  删除换行 ankle vein with the subcutaneous tourniquet in the lower  删除换行 third of the leg will satisfactorily outline the deep veins  删除换行 in the calf, popliteal vein and the femoral vein as far as  删除换行 the inguinal ligament. The iliac veins, however, are not  删除换行 satisfactorily visualised by this technique and it is better  删除换行 to perform either direct puncture of the femoral vein in  删除换行 the groin or to use an intra-osseous route via the iliac  删除换行 crest or the greater trochanter. If iliac vein thrombosis  删除换行 exists, cross-over collateral channels can be seen running  删除换行 across the pelvis, whereas the common iliac segment of  删除换行 the affected side will not fill. In lower segment disease  删除换行 with incompetent perforating veins it is often possible to  删除换行 see refilling of the superficial vein proximal to the  删除换行 obstructing tourniquet via the incompetent perforators.\n\n【18】SELF INFLICTED ULCERS.—\n\n【19】Management of the venous oedema differs according  删除换行 to the segment involved.\n\n【20】Iliofemoral thrombosis.— This condition more often  删除换行 presents acutely with rapidly developing swelling of the  删除换行 entire limb.\n\n【21】If the patient is seen within a few days of onset,  删除换行 the treatment is operation of thrombectomy. Successful  删除换行 thrombectomy not only relieves oedema but will restore  删除换行 longterm patency and avoid chronic swelling and  删除换行 discomfort. The success of thrombectomy depends on the  删除换行 duration of the thrombotic process at the time of  删除换行 operation. Thrombectomy within 48 hours of onset gives  删除换行 the best result. With each succeeding 24 hours period,  删除换行 the prospects of success diminish considerably. When the  删除换行 diagnosis is easy with considerable swollen leg and  删除换行 tenderness over the femoral vein in the groin or even  删除换行 tenderness over the iliac veins in the lower abdomen,  删除换行 investigation is unnecessary and operation should be  删除换行 straightaway carried out. With less dramatic clinical  删除换行 picture, phlebography is a useful investigation and will  删除换行 reveal the site and extent of the thrombotic process.\n\n【22】Technique of operation.—It is important to have 2  删除换行 litres of blood ready for transfusion in hand before the  删除换行 operation is started. General anaesthesia is preferred. The  删除换行 common femoral vein and its tributaries are exposed in  删除换行 the groin. A longitudinal venotomy is performed. The  删除换行 thrombus is extracted with the aid of suction catheters  删除换行 and the Fogarty balloon catheter. Complete extraction of  删除换行 clot from the distal leg can be helped by distal to  删除换行 proximal bandaging with Esmarch bandage. Proximal  删除换行 thrombosis is removed by the balloon catheter. If there is  删除换行 doubt as to complete removal of proximal thrombus, a  删除换行 venogram may be performed on the operation table. \n\n【23】When no further clot remains and free flow is obtained  删除换行 from the proximal to distal segments, the venotomy 删除换行 incision is closed. Concomitant plication of the inferior  删除换行 venacava may be necessary if dislodgement of thrombosis  删除换行 with pulmonary embolisation is feared.\n\n【24】A small polythene catheter is guided through a  删除换行 tributary of the long saphenous vein into the common  删除换行 femoral vein. This catheter is utilised to maintain a  删除换行 continuous drip of heparinised saline which should be  删除换行 maintained for the first postoperative week. Phlebography  删除换行 or venogram is performed through this catheter on 1, 2  删除换行 and 4 days postoperatively. If a residual thrombus is  删除换行 revealed, a fibrinolytic agent such as urokinase should be  删除换行 used through the catheter with the repeated venographic  删除换行 control.\n\n【25】The limb should be kept elevated in the postoperative  删除换行 period. In those patients who present late for  删除换行 thrombectomy, a long term anticoagulation should be  删除换行 carried out. Once the initial oedema has subsided the  删除换行 patient may become ambulant Wearing a firm supportive  删除换行 bandage.\n\n【26】Chronic iliofemoral venous obstruction.— Treatment  删除换行 of choice is conservative management with external support  删除换行 to the limb in the form of elastic bandage or elastic  删除换行 stockings. The patient should sleep with the footend of  删除换行 the bed elevated. Diuretics may be prescribed to reduce  删除换行 the swelling.\n\n【27】Only surgery which can help the patient is a cross删除8：<u>￾</u>over operation using the opposite long saphenous vein.\n\n【28】Lower segment disease.— The main problem is  删除换行 venous ulceration and the treatment of this condition  删除换行 has been described under the. heading of 'venous ulcer' \n\n【29】in the chapter of 'Varicose Veins'.\n\n【30】DIABETIC ULCER.—\nPathology On an aetiological basis, lymphoedema  删除换行 may be divided into 2 groups :\n\n【31】(a) Primary lymphoedema in which there is a  删除换行 developmental error of the regional lymphatic system.\n\n【32】(b) Secondary lymphoedema in which there is  删除换行 acquired pathology of the defective local lymphatic system.\n\n【33】PRIMARY LYMPHOEDEMA.—This can be divided  删除换行 into three clinical subgroups according to the age of onset  删除换行 of the swelling.\n\n【34】(i) In lymphoedema congenita, the oedema is  删除换行 present in birth. This was first described by Milroy in  删除换行 1892. This variety is comparatively rare and occurs in  删除换行 about 10% of all cases of primary lymphoedema.\n\n【35】(ii) Lymphoedema praecox starts in adolescents and  删除换行 this constitutes 75% of patients with primary  删除换行 lymphoedema.\n\n【36】(iii) Lymphoedema tarda constitutes 15% of patients删除27：<u>190 A TEXTBOOK ON SURGICAL SHORT CASES</u>\n\n【37】with primary lymphoedema and in these cases the swelling  删除换行 is delayed until after the age of 35 years.\n\n【38】In primary lymphoedema there is some developmental  删除换行 fault in the lymphatic system and a family history is found  删除换行 in about 1/5th cases. In about 1/2 the patients the  删除换行 malformation is predominantly unilateral.\n\n【39】Lymphangiography has demonstrated 3 basic types of  删除换行 malformation in this disease —\n\n【40】(a) Aplasia of the subcutaneous lymph trunks in  删除换行 the limbs is found in 13% of patients. Formed lymphatic  删除换行 vessels are absent, but there are haphazardly arranged  删除换行 lymph spaces with no attempt to form lymphatic channels. \n\n【41】This is a severe malformation and is often associated with  删除换行 the congenital variety.\n\n【42】(b) In 75% of cases the subcutaneous lymphatic  删除换行 trunks in the leg are hypoplastic. They may be too small  删除换行 in size and number. The commonest defect in this group  删除换行 is presence of a solitary lymph vessel, which ascends the  删除换行 limb without normal bifurcation and branching. This  删除换行 may be termed solitary hypoplasia, which may extend  删除换行 upto the knee or even upto the groin. In a small number  删除换行 of patients hypoplasia may affect the lymph nodes in the  删除换行 groin while the lymph trunks remain normal.\n\n【43】(c) The third malformation is the varicose or 删除换行 dilated lymph trunks seen in 12% of patients with primary  删除换行 lymphoedema. In this condition the subcutaneous tissues  删除换行 are filled with dilated and tortuous lymphatics which are  删除换行 incompetent and allow retrograde reflux of lymph. This  删除换行 is often associated with diffuse arteriovenous fistulae. The  删除换行 varicose state may extend proximally to involve the pelvic  删除换行 and even para-aortic lymph trunks. This allows retrograde  删除换行 flow of intestinal chyle into the groin and thigh. Chyle删除8：<u>￾</u>filled vesicles may appear in the skin of the leg and  删除换行 troublesome leak of milky lymph may develop.\n\n【44】The prognosis of primary lymphoedema depends on  删除换行 the type and extent of the malformation. While lymphatic  删除换行 function is severely prejudiced in aplasia and the varicose  删除换行 types, hypoplastic variety is less troublesome.\n\n【45】SECONDARY LYMPHOEDEMA.— This condition  删除换行 may follow involvement of the lymph channels or lymph  删除换行 nodes by neoplastic or inflammatory process, by surgical  删除换行 excision or by radiotherapy. In some areas parasitic  删除换行 infestation with filariasis is destructive within the lymph  删除换行 nodes and' may produce secondary lymphoedema. In the  删除换行 majority of cases of secondary lymphoedema the disease  删除换行 process is a local affair in contrast to the primary  删除换行 lymphoedema where the malformation is widespread over  删除换行 an entire limb.\n\n【46】Clinical features.—\n\n【47】Primary lymphoedema is mostly seen in adolescent  删除换行 girls. The swelling begins insidiously with no apparent 删除换行 cause.

Severe oedema 删除换行 of venous origin is invariably related to the deep vein disease.\n\n【2】The clinical outcome of the deep vein disease varies with  删除换行 the segment of the venous tree involved. Grossly swollen  删除换行 limb is usually associated with upper segment or  删除换行 iliofemoral vein pathology. The initial lesion is thrombus  删除换行 formation. Acute obstruction produced by rapidly  删除换行 developing thrombosis, particularly in the iliofemoral  删除换行 segment, will produce severe swelling. As the venous  删除换行 collateral circulation develops this swelling gradually  删除换行 subsides. Recanalisation of the thrombosed segment later  删除换行 on takes place and during this time the limb remains  删除换行 comfortable. When the latter process is complete, the  删除换行 previously thrombosed segment will regain patency but  删除换行 the valves are permanently destroyed. This leads to venous  删除换行 hypertension and oedema formation.\n\n【3】Deep vein thrombosis affecting lower segment or calf  删除换行 veins may not produce a big swelling. The principal lesion  删除换行 here is the incompetence of valves in the perforating  删除换行 veins. Minor oedema occur in these cases in the lower  删除换行 third of the leg and foot.

The medial  删除换行 group of perforating veins are usually constant and it is  删除换行 the skin above the medial malleolus that suffers most in  删除换行 perforating vein disease.\n\n【5】Clinical features.—\n\n【6】Severe oedema of venous origin is invariably related  删除换行 to deep vein disease. The history and clinical picture  删除换行 vary according to the segment of the venous tree involved.\n\n【7】Iliofemoral thrombosis.— This starts with an acute  删除换行 onset with rapid development of painful swelling from  删除换行 groin to foot. This condition is classically seen (i) in 删除换行 puerperium (phlegmasia alba dolens), (ii) in the  删除换行 postoperative patient, (iii) in bedfast medical patient, (iv)  删除换行 in patients with contraceptive pills or (iv) with latent  删除换行 carcinoma.\n\n【8】If the entire iliofemoral segment is involved, the limb  删除换行 is quickly swollen and cyanotic. There may be fever and  删除换行 tachycardia. Localised tenderness may be present in the  删除换行 groin over the femoral vein.\n\n【9】'Phlegmasia cerulea dolens' is the most severe form of  删除换行 iliofemoral thrombosis and is the result of almost total  删除换行 outflow obstruction. Gross swelling develops rapidly and  删除换行 the limbs become dusky cyanotic in colour with patches  删除换行 of cutaneous gangrene. Arterial pulses are impalpable due  删除换行 to oedema.\n\n【10】With lesser degrees of iliofemoral thrombosis a  删除换行 satisfactory venous collateral circulation gradually develops  删除换行 and the swelling comes down within a few weeks,  删除换行 although the limb may become uncomfortable with  删除换行 exercise.\n\n【11】Recanalisation of the occluded segment may become  删除换行 complete after a considerable interval and by then the  删除换行 valvular competence is permanently destroyed. At this stage  删除换行 swelling again worsens and the symptoms of venous  删除换行 hypertension become evident.\n\n【12】Iliac vein compression.— Oedema may be produced  删除换行 by anatomical compression of the left common iliac vein  删除换行 by the right common iliac artery. Some authors have  删除换行 also described bands and webs within the lumen of the  删除换行 left common iliac vein. Phlebography will diagnose either  删除换行 compression or intraluminal abnormalities.\n\n【13】Lower segment thrombosis.— Deep vein thrombosis in  删除换行 the calf veins is a very common complication of the  删除换行 postoperative period. But in this condition swellng is  删除换行 usually minimal. Pulmonary embolisation may result in  删除换行 this thrombosis. But destruction of the valves in the  删除换行 perforating veins is the main feature of postphlebitic  删除换行 syndrome which may develop at a considerable time  删除换行 interval from the initial thrombotic incident. Due to  删除换行 incompetent perforating veins in the lower third of the  删除换行 leg, the subcutaneous tissue and skin in this area become  删除换行 exposed to 'high pressure leak' from the calf muscle pump. \n\n【14】The result is venous ulceration which is the real problem  删除换行 and not the swelling.\n\n【15】Special Investigations.—\n\n【16】Before radiology of the venous system is taken, the  删除换行 patient must be put to bed with high elevation of the  删除换行 limb. A diuretic such as frusemide, should be given. In  删除换行 this way the degree of swelling is reduced considerably  删除换行 within a few days. If the aetiology of the swelling cannot  删除换行 be found out, it is better to do the phlebograhy first,  删除换行 followed by lymphangiography.SWOLLEN LEG 189\n\n【17】Phlebography.— Injection of radio-opaque dye into an  删除换行 ankle vein with the subcutaneous tourniquet in the lower  删除换行 third of the leg will satisfactorily outline the deep veins  删除换行 in the calf, popliteal vein and the femoral vein as far as  删除换行 the inguinal ligament. The iliac veins, however, are not  删除换行 satisfactorily visualised by this technique and it is better  删除换行 to perform either direct puncture of the femoral vein in  删除换行 the groin or to use an intra-osseous route via the iliac  删除换行 crest or the greater trochanter. If iliac vein thrombosis  删除换行 exists, cross-over collateral channels can be seen running  删除换行 across the pelvis, whereas the common iliac segment of  删除换行 the affected side will not fill. In lower segment disease  删除换行 with incompetent perforating veins it is often possible to  删除换行 see refilling of the superficial vein proximal to the  删除换行 obstructing tourniquet via the incompetent perforators.\n\n【18】SELF INFLICTED ULCERS.—\n\n【19】Management of the venous oedema differs according  删除换行 to the segment involved.\n\n【20】Iliofemoral thrombosis.— This condition more often  删除换行 presents acutely with rapidly developing swelling of the  删除换行 entire limb.\n\n【21】If the patient is seen within a few days of onset,  删除换行 the treatment is operation of thrombectomy. Successful  删除换行 thrombectomy not only relieves oedema but will restore  删除换行 longterm patency and avoid chronic swelling and  删除换行 discomfort. The success of thrombectomy depends on the  删除换行 duration of the thrombotic process at the time of  删除换行 operation. Thrombectomy within 48 hours of onset gives  删除换行 the best result. With each succeeding 24 hours period,  删除换行 the prospects of success diminish considerably. When the  删除换行 diagnosis is easy with considerable swollen leg and  删除换行 tenderness over the femoral vein in the groin or even  删除换行 tenderness over the iliac veins in the lower abdomen,  删除换行 investigation is unnecessary and operation should be  删除换行 straightaway carried out. With less dramatic clinical  删除换行 picture, phlebography is a useful investigation and will  删除换行 reveal the site and extent of the thrombotic process.\n\n【22】Technique of operation.—It is important to have 2  删除换行 litres of blood ready for transfusion in hand before the  删除换行 operation is started. General anaesthesia is preferred. The  删除换行 common femoral vein and its tributaries are exposed in  删除换行 the groin. A longitudinal venotomy is performed. The  删除换行 thrombus is extracted with the aid of suction catheters  删除换行 and the Fogarty balloon catheter. Complete extraction of  删除换行 clot from the distal leg can be helped by distal to  删除换行 proximal bandaging with Esmarch bandage. Proximal  删除换行 thrombosis is removed by the balloon catheter. If there is  删除换行 doubt as to complete removal of proximal thrombus, a  删除换行 venogram may be performed on the operation table. \n\n【23】When no further clot remains and free flow is obtained  删除换行 from the proximal to distal segments, the venotomy 删除换行 incision is closed. Concomitant plication of the inferior  删除换行 venacava may be necessary if dislodgement of thrombosis  删除换行 with pulmonary embolisation is feared.\n\n【24】A small polythene catheter is guided through a  删除换行 tributary of the long saphenous vein into the common  删除换行 femoral vein. This catheter is utilised to maintain a  删除换行 continuous drip of heparinised saline which should be  删除换行 maintained for the first postoperative week. Phlebography  删除换行 or venogram is performed through this catheter on 1, 2  删除换行 and 4 days postoperatively. If a residual thrombus is  删除换行 revealed, a fibrinolytic agent such as urokinase should be  删除换行 used through the catheter with the repeated venographic  删除换行 control.\n\n【25】The limb should be kept elevated in the postoperative  删除换行 period. In those patients who present late for  删除换行 thrombectomy, a long term anticoagulation should be  删除换行 carried out. Once the initial oedema has subsided the  删除换行 patient may become ambulant Wearing a firm supportive  删除换行 bandage.\n\n【26】Chronic iliofemoral venous obstruction.— Treatment  删除换行 of choice is conservative management with external support  删除换行 to the limb in the form of elastic bandage or elastic  删除换行 stockings. The patient should sleep with the footend of  删除换行 the bed elevated. Diuretics may be prescribed to reduce  删除换行 the swelling.\n\n【27】Only surgery which can help the patient is a cross删除8：<u>￾</u>over operation using the opposite long saphenous vein.\n\n【28】Lower segment disease.— The main problem is  删除换行 venous ulceration and the treatment of this condition  删除换行 has been described under the. heading of 'venous ulcer' \n\n【29】in the chapter of 'Varicose Veins'.\n\n【30】DIABETIC ULCER.—\nPathology On an aetiological basis, lymphoedema  删除换行 may be divided into 2 groups :\n\n【31】(a) Primary lymphoedema in which there is a  删除换行 developmental error of the regional lymphatic system.\n\n【32】(b) Secondary lymphoedema in which there is  删除换行 acquired pathology of the defective local lymphatic system.\n\n【33】PRIMARY LYMPHOEDEMA.—This can be divided  删除换行 into three clinical subgroups according to the age of onset  删除换行 of the swelling.\n\n【34】(i) In lymphoedema congenita, the oedema is  删除换行 present in birth. This was first described by Milroy in  删除换行 1892. This variety is comparatively rare and occurs in  删除换行 about 10% of all cases of primary lymphoedema.\n\n【35】(ii) Lymphoedema praecox starts in adolescents and  删除换行 this constitutes 75% of patients with primary  删除换行 lymphoedema.\n\n【36】(iii) Lymphoedema tarda constitutes 15% of patients删除27：<u>190 A TEXTBOOK ON SURGICAL SHORT CASES</u>\n\n【37】with primary lymphoedema and in these cases the swelling  删除换行 is delayed until after the age of 35 years.\n\n【38】In primary lymphoedema there is some developmental  删除换行 fault in the lymphatic system and a family history is found  删除换行 in about 1/5th cases. In about 1/2 the patients the  删除换行 malformation is predominantly unilateral.\n\n【39】Lymphangiography has demonstrated 3 basic types of  删除换行 malformation in this disease —\n\n【40】(a) Aplasia of the subcutaneous lymph trunks in  删除换行 the limbs is found in 13% of patients. Formed lymphatic  删除换行 vessels are absent, but there are haphazardly arranged  删除换行 lymph spaces with no attempt to form lymphatic channels. \n\n【41】This is a severe malformation and is often associated with  删除换行 the congenital variety.\n\n【42】(b) In 75% of cases the subcutaneous lymphatic  删除换行 trunks in the leg are hypoplastic. They may be too small  删除换行 in size and number. The commonest defect in this group  删除换行 is presence of a solitary lymph vessel, which ascends the  删除换行 limb without normal bifurcation and branching. This  删除换行 may be termed solitary hypoplasia, which may extend  删除换行 upto the knee or even upto the groin. In a small number  删除换行 of patients hypoplasia may affect the lymph nodes in the  删除换行 groin while the lymph trunks remain normal.\n\n【43】(c) The third malformation is the varicose or 删除换行 dilated lymph trunks seen in 12% of patients with primary  删除换行 lymphoedema. In this condition the subcutaneous tissues  删除换行 are filled with dilated and tortuous lymphatics which are  删除换行 incompetent and allow retrograde reflux of lymph. This  删除换行 is often associated with diffuse arteriovenous fistulae. The  删除换行 varicose state may extend proximally to involve the pelvic  删除换行 and even para-aortic lymph trunks. This allows retrograde  删除换行 flow of intestinal chyle into the groin and thigh. Chyle删除8：<u>￾</u>filled vesicles may appear in the skin of the leg and  删除换行 troublesome leak of milky lymph may develop.\n\n【44】The prognosis of primary lymphoedema depends on  删除换行 the type and extent of the malformation. While lymphatic  删除换行 function is severely prejudiced in aplasia and the varicose  删除换行 types, hypoplastic variety is less troublesome.\n\n【45】SECONDARY LYMPHOEDEMA.— This condition  删除换行 may follow involvement of the lymph channels or lymph  删除换行 nodes by neoplastic or inflammatory process, by surgical  删除换行 excision or by radiotherapy. In some areas parasitic  删除换行 infestation with filariasis is destructive within the lymph  删除换行 nodes and' may produce secondary lymphoedema. In the  删除换行 majority of cases of secondary lymphoedema the disease  删除换行 process is a local affair in contrast to the primary  删除换行 lymphoedema where the malformation is widespread over  删除换行 an entire limb.\n\n【46】Clinical features.—\n\n【47】Primary lymphoedema is mostly seen in adolescent  删除换行 girls. The swelling begins insidiously with no apparent 删除换行 cause. The patient first notices a little puffiness around  删除换行 the ankle which disappears after a night's rest only to  删除换行 return at a late stage of the next day. Gradually the  删除换行 oedema progresses slowly. Severe swelling is unusual until  删除换行 several years have elapsed.

Formed lymphatic  删除换行 vessels are absent, but there are haphazardly arranged  删除换行 lymph spaces with no attempt to form lymphatic channels. \n\n【41】This is a severe malformation and is often associated with  删除换行 the congenital variety.\n\n【42】(b) In 75% of cases the subcutaneous lymphatic  删除换行 trunks in the leg are hypoplastic. They may be too small  删除换行 in size and number. The commonest defect in this group  删除换行 is presence of a solitary lymph vessel, which ascends the  删除换行 limb without normal bifurcation and branching. This  删除换行 may be termed solitary hypoplasia, which may extend  删除换行 upto the knee or even upto the groin. In a small number  删除换行 of patients hypoplasia may affect the lymph nodes in the  删除换行 groin while the lymph trunks remain normal.\n\n【43】(c) The third malformation is the varicose or 删除换行 dilated lymph trunks seen in 12% of patients with primary  删除换行 lymphoedema. In this condition the subcutaneous tissues  删除换行 are filled with dilated and tortuous lymphatics which are  删除换行 incompetent and allow retrograde reflux of lymph. This  删除换行 is often associated with diffuse arteriovenous fistulae. The  删除换行 varicose state may extend proximally to involve the pelvic  删除换行 and even para-aortic lymph trunks. This allows retrograde  删除换行 flow of intestinal chyle into the groin and thigh. Chyle删除8：<u>￾</u>filled vesicles may appear in the skin of the leg and  删除换行 troublesome leak of milky lymph may develop.\n\n【44】The prognosis of primary lymphoedema depends on  删除换行 the type and extent of the malformation. While lymphatic  删除换行 function is severely prejudiced in aplasia and the varicose  删除换行 types, hypoplastic variety is less troublesome.\n\n【45】SECONDARY LYMPHOEDEMA.— This condition  删除换行 may follow involvement of the lymph channels or lymph  删除换行 nodes by neoplastic or inflammatory process, by surgical  删除换行 excision or by radiotherapy. In some areas parasitic  删除换行 infestation with filariasis is destructive within the lymph  删除换行 nodes and' may produce secondary lymphoedema. In the  删除换行 majority of cases of secondary lymphoedema the disease  删除换行 process is a local affair in contrast to the primary  删除换行 lymphoedema where the malformation is widespread over  删除换行 an entire limb.\n\n【46】Clinical features.—\n\n【47】Primary lymphoedema is mostly seen in adolescent  删除换行 girls. The swelling begins insidiously with no apparent 删除换行 cause. The patient first notices a little puffiness around  删除换行 the ankle which disappears after a night's rest only to  删除换行 return at a late stage of the next day. Gradually the  删除换行 oedema progresses slowly. Severe swelling is unusual until  删除换行 several years have elapsed. The most important feature is  删除换行 that the swelling is painless (in contrast to venous disease). \n\n【48】The main complaint of the patient is cosmetic appearance.\n\n【49】Secondary lymphoedema develops much more rapidly. \n\n【50】Usually there is clear indication of the local pathology \n\n【51】(as mentioned earlier in the classification). This swelling  删除换行 is usually accompanied by discomfort in the swollen  删除换行 tissues. Recurrent cellulitis is not uncommon. The  删除换行 infection is usually streptococcal. High pyrexia and rigors  删除换行 are usually accompanied with.\n\n【52】Clinically, it may not be so easy to differentiate  删除换行 venous from lymphatic oedema. But skin changes,  删除换行 pigmentation, atrophy and tendency to ulceration favour  删除换行 the diagnosis of post-phlebitic swelling of venous origin. \n\n【53】In a lymphoedema the skin remains usually healthy except  删除换行 slight thickening, hyperkeratosis and recurrent cellulitis. \n\n【54】Pain is an important symptom of swelling of venous  删除换行 aetiology, which is rarely seen in lymphoedema.\n\n【55】Special Investigations.—\n\n【56】Lymphangiography.— In this technique the lymphatics  删除换行 of the lower limb are delineated with radio-opaque dye.\n\n【57】Surgically, a lymphatic trunk of the dorsum of the  删除换行 foot is exposed. Iodised oil contrast medium (neohydriol  删除换行 ultrafluid lipiodol) should be injected directly into the  删除换行 exposed lymphatic trunk on the dorsum of the foot. By  删除换行 this contrast medium the lymph nodes as well as lymph  删除换行 trunks can be well visualised radiographically. The contrast  删除换行 medium is warmed and injected into the exposed lymph  删除换行 trunk. For a lower limb, approximately 6 ml of solution  删除换行 is injected over a period of 1 hour.

Severe oedema 删除换行 of venous origin is invariably related to the deep vein disease.\n\n【2】The clinical outcome of the deep vein disease varies with  删除换行 the segment of the venous tree involved. Grossly swollen  删除换行 limb is usually associated with upper segment or  删除换行 iliofemoral vein pathology. The initial lesion is thrombus  删除换行 formation. Acute obstruction produced by rapidly  删除换行 developing thrombosis, particularly in the iliofemoral  删除换行 segment, will produce severe swelling. As the venous  删除换行 collateral circulation develops this swelling gradually  删除换行 subsides. Recanalisation of the thrombosed segment later  删除换行 on takes place and during this time the limb remains  删除换行 comfortable. When the latter process is complete, the  删除换行 previously thrombosed segment will regain patency but  删除换行 the valves are permanently destroyed. This leads to venous  删除换行 hypertension and oedema formation.\n\n<mark>【3】Deep vein thrombosis affecting lower segment or calf  删除换行 veins may not produce a big swelling. The principal lesion  删除换行 here is the incompetence of valves in the perforating  删除换行 veins. Minor oedema occur in these cases in the lower  删除换行 third of the leg and foot. But of greater significance are  删除换行 the changes produced in the local tissues exposed to the\n\n【4】‘high pressure leak’ due to the calf muscle pump. Skin  删除换行 atrophy and subcutaneous fibrosis may develop which will  删除换行 gradually lead to chronic ulceration and this is the most  删除换行 constant feature of postphlebitic syndrome. The medial  删除换行 group of perforating veins are usually constant and it is  删除换行 the skin above the medial malleolus that suffers most in  删除换行 perforating vein disease.\n\n</mark>\n【5】Clinical features.—\n\n【6】Severe oedema of venous origin is invariably related  删除换行 to deep vein disease. The history and clinical picture  删除换行 vary according to the segment of the venous tree involved.\n\n【7】Iliofemoral thrombosis.— This starts with an acute  删除换行 onset with rapid development of painful swelling from  删除换行 groin to foot. This condition is classically seen (i) in 删除换行 puerperium (phlegmasia alba dolens), (ii) in the  删除换行 postoperative patient, (iii) in bedfast medical patient, (iv)  删除换行 in patients with contraceptive pills or (iv) with latent  删除换行 carcinoma.\n\n【8】If the entire iliofemoral segment is involved, the limb  删除换行 is quickly swollen and cyanotic. There may be fever and  删除换行 tachycardia. Localised tenderness may be present in the  删除换行 groin over the femoral vein.\n\n【9】'Phlegmasia cerulea dolens' is the most severe form of  删除换行 iliofemoral thrombosis and is the result of almost total  删除换行 outflow obstruction. Gross swelling develops rapidly and  删除换行 the limbs become dusky cyanotic in colour with patches  删除换行 of cutaneous gangrene. Arterial pulses are impalpable due  删除换行 to oedema.\n\n【10】With lesser degrees of iliofemoral thrombosis a  删除换行 satisfactory venous collateral circulation gradually develops  删除换行 and the swelling comes down within a few weeks,  删除换行 although the limb may become uncomfortable with  删除换行 exercise.\n\n【11】Recanalisation of the occluded segment may become  删除换行 complete after a considerable interval and by then the  删除换行 valvular competence is permanently destroyed. At this stage  删除换行 swelling again worsens and the symptoms of venous  删除换行 hypertension become evident.\n\n【12】Iliac vein compression.— Oedema may be produced  删除换行 by anatomical compression of the left common iliac vein  删除换行 by the right common iliac artery. Some authors have  删除换行 also described bands and webs within the lumen of the  删除换行 left common iliac vein. Phlebography will diagnose either  删除换行 compression or intraluminal abnormalities.\n\n【13】Lower segment thrombosis.— Deep vein thrombosis in  删除换行 the calf veins is a very common complication of the  删除换行 postoperative period. But in this condition swellng is  删除换行 usually minimal. Pulmonary embolisation may result in  删除换行 this thrombosis. But destruction of the valves in the  删除换行 perforating veins is the main feature of postphlebitic  删除换行 syndrome which may develop at a considerable time  删除换行 interval from the initial thrombotic incident. Due to  删除换行 incompetent perforating veins in the lower third of the  删除换行 leg, the subcutaneous tissue and skin in this area become  删除换行 exposed to 'high pressure leak' from the calf muscle pump. \n\n【14】The result is venous ulceration which is the real problem  删除换行 and not the swelling.\n\n【15】Special Investigations.—\n\n【16】Before radiology of the venous system is taken, the  删除换行 patient must be put to bed with high elevation of the  删除换行 limb. A diuretic such as frusemide, should be given. In  删除换行 this way the degree of swelling is reduced considerably  删除换行 within a few days. If the aetiology of the swelling cannot  删除换行 be found out, it is better to do the phlebograhy first,  删除换行 followed by lymphangiography.<mark>SWOLLEN LEG 189</mark>\n\n【17】Phlebography.— Injection of radio-opaque dye into an  删除换行 ankle vein with the subcutaneous tourniquet in the lower  删除换行 third of the leg will satisfactorily outline the deep veins  删除换行 in the calf, popliteal vein and the femoral vein as far as  删除换行 the inguinal ligament. The iliac veins, however, are not  删除换行 satisfactorily visualised by this technique and it is better  删除换行 to perform either direct puncture of the femoral vein in  删除换行 the groin or to use an intra-osseous route via the iliac  删除换行 crest or the greater trochanter. If iliac vein thrombosis  删除换行 exists, cross-over collateral channels can be seen running  删除换行 across the pelvis, whereas the common iliac segment of  删除换行 the affected side will not fill. In lower segment disease  删除换行 with incompetent perforating veins it is often possible to  删除换行 see refilling of the superficial vein proximal to the  删除换行 obstructing tourniquet via the incompetent perforators.\n\n【18】SELF INFLICTED ULCERS.—\n\n【19】Management of the venous oedema differs according  删除换行 to the segment involved.\n\n【20】Iliofemoral thrombosis.— This condition more often  删除换行 presents acutely with rapidly developing swelling of the  删除换行 entire limb.\n\n【21】If the patient is seen within a few days of onset,  删除换行 the treatment is operation of thrombectomy. Successful  删除换行 thrombectomy not only relieves oedema but will restore  删除换行 longterm patency and avoid chronic swelling and  删除换行 discomfort. The success of thrombectomy depends on the  删除换行 duration of the thrombotic process at the time of  删除换行 operation. Thrombectomy within 48 hours of onset gives  删除换行 the best result. With each succeeding 24 hours period,  删除换行 the prospects of success diminish considerably. When the  删除换行 diagnosis is easy with considerable swollen leg and  删除换行 tenderness over the femoral vein in the groin or even  删除换行 tenderness over the iliac veins in the lower abdomen,  删除换行 investigation is unnecessary and operation should be  删除换行 straightaway carried out. With less dramatic clinical  删除换行 picture, phlebography is a useful investigation and will  删除换行 reveal the site and extent of the thrombotic process.\n\n【22】Technique of operation.—It is important to have 2  删除换行 litres of blood ready for transfusion in hand before the  删除换行 operation is started. General anaesthesia is preferred. The  删除换行 common femoral vein and its tributaries are exposed in  删除换行 the groin. A longitudinal venotomy is performed. The  删除换行 thrombus is extracted with the aid of suction catheters  删除换行 and the Fogarty balloon catheter. Complete extraction of  删除换行 clot from the distal leg can be helped by distal to  删除换行 proximal bandaging with Esmarch bandage. Proximal  删除换行 thrombosis is removed by the balloon catheter. If there is  删除换行 doubt as to complete removal of proximal thrombus, a  删除换行 venogram may be performed on the operation table. \n\n【23】When no further clot remains and free flow is obtained  删除换行 from the proximal to distal segments, the venotomy 删除换行 incision is closed. Concomitant plication of the inferior  删除换行 venacava may be necessary if dislodgement of thrombosis  删除换行 with pulmonary embolisation is feared.\n\n【24】A small polythene catheter is guided through a  删除换行 tributary of the long saphenous vein into the common  删除换行 femoral vein. This catheter is utilised to maintain a  删除换行 continuous drip of heparinised saline which should be  删除换行 maintained for the first postoperative week. Phlebography  删除换行 or venogram is performed through this catheter on 1, 2  删除换行 and 4 days postoperatively. If a residual thrombus is  删除换行 revealed, a fibrinolytic agent such as urokinase should be  删除换行 used through the catheter with the repeated venographic  删除换行 control.\n\n【25】The limb should be kept elevated in the postoperative  删除换行 period. In those patients who present late for  删除换行 thrombectomy, a long term anticoagulation should be  删除换行 carried out. Once the initial oedema has subsided the  删除换行 patient may become ambulant Wearing a firm supportive  删除换行 bandage.\n\n【26】Chronic iliofemoral venous obstruction.— Treatment  删除换行 of choice is conservative management with external support  删除换行 to the limb in the form of elastic bandage or elastic  删除换行 stockings. The patient should sleep with the footend of  删除换行 the bed elevated.

This patient’s constellation of symptoms and prior hospitaliza-tion points toward pseudomembranous colitis. Clostridium difficile proliferation causes the severe non-bloody diarrhea associated with pseudomembranous colitis by producing an exotoxin that kills enterocytes. Antibiotic treatments suppress the normal flora of the GI tract, allowing C difficile to multiply. Clindamycin was the first antibiotic associated with C difficile gastroenteritis and is used often to treat anaerobic infections above the diaphragm, such as aspiration pneumonia. However, many antibiotics have been implicated since then, especially cephalosporins and am-picillin.

Although the SHO made the right decision to admit under the surgical  删除换行 team, it is worth keeping an open mind to the diagnosis in view of its recurrent nature  删除换行 and family history. The combination of recurrent serositis (peritonitis and pleuritis), fever  删除换行 and eastern Mediterranean origin raises the possibility of familial Mediterranean fever \n\n【11】(FMF) as the underlying diagnosis.\n\n【12】FMF is an autosomal recessively inherited periodic syndrome characterized by stereo删除8：<u>￾</u>typed attacks of fever and inflammatory features which last up to 4 days and then remit  删除换行 spontaneously.

Patients in whom one suspects FMF should be referred to a specialist  删除换行 centre for genetic testing.\n\n【20】One of the feared complications of FMF is the development of amyloidosis. Amyloidosis  删除换行 is a multisystem disease caused by the deposition of insoluble protein in the extracellular  删除换行 matrix: renal, cardiac and hepatic tissues are commonly affected.

His right knee is also exquisitely tender and slightly swollen. He has suffered  删除换行 recurrent attacks with a similar presentation since childhood, although normally they are  删除换行 more severe and also include pleurisy. He has been told that ‘it runs in the family’. The  删除换行 attacks resolve spontaneously and in between times he is entirely well.\n\n【3】Examination\n\n【4】This adolescent is very uncomfortable, with a temperature of 38.8°C. His pulse rate is  删除换行 110/min, blood pressure 115/63 mmHg. He has marked abdominal tenderness with  删除换行 rebound and guarding; his bowel sounds are reduced. There is a mild and cool effusion  删除换行 of his right knee, which is extremely tender. The rest of his examination is normal.\n\n【5】Questions\n\n【6】• What diagnosis might explain recurrent abdominal pain, pleurisy and fever?\n\n【7】• How would you investigate this patient?\n\n【8】• What is the feared complication of the underlying diagnosis?\n\n【9】• How would you treat this patient?删除5：<u>182</u>\n删除7：<u>100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology</u>\nANSWER 65\n\n【10】The admitting senior house officer decided to refer this adolescent to the surgical team as  删除换行 an acute abdomen. Although the SHO made the right decision to admit under the surgical  删除换行 team, it is worth keeping an open mind to the diagnosis in view of its recurrent nature  删除换行 and family history. The combination of recurrent serositis (peritonitis and pleuritis), fever  删除换行 and eastern Mediterranean origin raises the possibility of familial Mediterranean fever \n\n【11】(FMF) as the underlying diagnosis.\n\n【12】FMF is an autosomal recessively inherited periodic syndrome characterized by stereo删除8：<u>￾</u>typed attacks of fever and inflammatory features which last up to 4 days and then remit  删除换行 spontaneously. The most common manifestations are:\n\n【13】• fever\n\n【14】• peritonitis\n\n【15】• arthritis\n\n【16】• pleuritis\n\n【17】• rash (erysipelas-like).\n\n【18】The arthritis is classically monoarticular and symptoms often outweigh the signs, with  删除换行 extreme tenderness despite only mild effusions and a marked absence of increased  删除换行 temperature.\n\n【19】This patient should still be investigated for acute abdomen with blood tests including  删除换行 inflammatory markers, amylase and lactate and imaging in the form of an abdominal and  删除换行 erect chest X-ray. Patients in whom one suspects FMF should be referred to a specialist  删除换行 centre for genetic testing.\n\n【20】One of the feared complications of FMF is the development of amyloidosis. Amyloidosis  删除换行 is a multisystem disease caused by the deposition of insoluble protein in the extracellular  删除换行 matrix: renal, cardiac and hepatic tissues are commonly affected. Primary amyloid (AL) is  删除换行 formed from deposition of immunoglobulin light chains and occurs in isolation or in the  删除换行 context of myeloma. Secondary or reactive amyloid (AA) is caused by the deposition of  删除换行 amyloid A rather than light chains and may complicate any chronic infective, malignant  删除换行 or inflammatory process such as FMF.\n\n【21】Colchicine is the treatment of choice. It is not only very effective at diminishing the  删除换行 attacks of serositis in FMF, but has also been shown to reduce the development of renal  删除换行 amyloidosis in these patients by up to two-thirds.\n\n【22】KEY POINTS\n\n【23】• Consider a periodic syndrome in anyone presenting with recurrent serositis and fever.\n\n【24】• The arthritis in FMF often generates a greater level of pain than one would expect from  删除换行 the clinical signs.删除5：<u>183</u>\nRheumatology", "index": 3678, "show": true, "start": 3678, "end": 3690, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/09/12 13:59:37", "endTime": "2024/09/12 14:00:04", "cost": 26.88}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:30", "update_time": "2024-09-11 22:00:03", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 21:59:36"}

Steve must be carefully assessed for suicidal ideation and intent. His statement that others would be better off if he were dead is indicative at least of passive suicidal ideation (thought). The clinician needs to understand whether Steve also has suicidal intent(plans to end his life).\n\n【39】To assess suicide risk， you would ask Steve if he has ever had specific thoughts about what he might do to act on his suicidal thoughts. Based on his response we would also ask if he has the means to carry out the plan he identifies (having a specific plan and the means greatly increase the risk of suicide). In addition you should be concerned about the lethality of the means he identifies. If Steve had any evidence of psychotic thinking， command hallucinations， impulsivity， or severe anxiety， his risk would be heightened. Other factors that increase risk include substance abuse history， a history of prior suicide attempts， or a family history of suicide death. Differential diagnoses would include：\n\n【40】1\\. Major depressive disorder： Steve reports several symptoms indicative of depression： \"feeling down\"”or depressed， lack of interest (anhedonia)， suicidal thoughts， worthlessness， guilt and worrying， sleep disturbance， weight gain， and decreased activity (r/o psychomotor retardation). Further history needs to be obtained to determine whether the depressed mood or anhedonia (and other symptoms) have been present nearly every day for at least 2 weeks. A comprehensive assessment of whether Steve is suicidal must be a priority of further discussion and followup.\n\n【41】2.Generalized anxiety disorder： Steve describes many worries that interfere with his sleep. He feels tense most of the time， is irritable， and has been having difficulty sleeping. Further information must be obtained about the worries he has to determine whether they are more than would be expected for a particular event or situation. In addition， it is not yet clear whether Steve is having difficulty controlling the worry or being able to relax or cope with anxiety. Finally， we would need to obtain a history of duration of symptoms， as the symptoms must be present for most days over the past 6 months for this condition to be diagnosed.\n\n【42】3.Posttraumatic stress disorder： Steve has several symptoms that may be a part of PTSD： Sleep dis-turbance， diminished interest， isolation from others， and irritability. Given Steve’s work history as a fireman and EMT， as well as his being a Vietnam veteran， it is worthwhile to consider whether he might have PTSD that has not been diagnosed. To be diagnosed with PTSD， individuals must have been exposed to an event where there was some threat to their physical integrity or to someone else's and where they experienced fear and helplessness as a result. In addition， there must be symptoms of re-experiencing (distressing memories or dreams of event， flashbacks， or physical or psychological distress with cues related to the event)， avoidance (of thoughts， feelings， activities， people involved with the trauma； feeling detached， diminished interest， or diminished participation)， and increased arousal (sleep disturbance， irritability， hypervigilance， difficulty concentrating). Symptoms of this disorder must be present for more than 1 month to be diagnosed as PTSD.\n\n【43】4\\. Alcohol abuse or dependence： Steve reports increasing his use of alcohol recently. In addition he is not fulfilling his role obligations in his household. It is important to obtain a full history of use of alcohol and recent use. Information on whether use is interfering in any way with role perfor mance is important. Alcohol is a central nervous system depressant； and if abuse is present， it precludes a clear diagnosis of other mental disorders.\n\n【44】What is your plan for treatment?\n\n【45】Treatment should include starting Steve on a SSRI to treat the depression. Given what appear to be anxiety related symptoms， an agent with properties to also treat anxiety would be beneficial. Citalopram， 10mg PO QD， to start may be helpful with both the depression and Steve's anxiety symptoms. Education related to treatment with an SSRI is important so that he understands that it may take from 2 to 4 weeks for him to have a full effect from the medication， and that if he experi-ences anxiety， agitation， or worsening suicidal ideation he should contact you or seek assessment and treatment. He should be told that once he starts to feel better he needs to stay on the medication and may require treatment for 6-9 months to prevent return of symptoms； therefore， it is wise to teach 删除换行 him that， when it is time to go off this medication， it is best to see you for instructions on slow taper-ing of the medication and for monitoring him for any change in status.\n\n【46】Sleep hygiene， increasing physical activity， coping skills， and encouragement to engage with support systems and in activities he has previously enjoyed would also be helpful. Referral to a mental health clinician is suggested， as psychotherapeutic approaches have been found to be as useful as medications and they may help Steve to change how he copes with difficulties in his life.\n\n【47】Steve should also be counseled related to weight loss； and he requires monitoring for changes in blood pressure and treatment of his hypertension.\n\n【48】What is your plan for follow-up care?\n\n【49】Steve should return within 2 weeks of starting on an antidepressant to be certain that he is not feeling more agitated or anxious as a result of starting treatment. In addition Steve should have his suicidal ideation re-evaluated at the follow-up visit to be certain that his condition is improving. Steve should be instructed to call if he experiences increased anxiety or suicidal thoughts or plans with the addi-tion of the SSRI.\n\n【50】Are any referrals needed?\n\n【51】Referral to a mental health clinician would be beneficial， particularly given the high rates of recur-rence of both depression and anxiety related disorders. Evidence suggests that the combination of psychotherapy and pharmacologic management of depression has better outcomes. If Steve has used a 12-step program like AA in the past， a referral now may be useful.\n\n【52】Does the patient's psychosocial history impact how you might treat this patient?\n\n【53】The patient's prior work and military history suggest a need to carefully assess for history of trauma that was not earlier identified and treated.\n\n【54】What if the patient lived in a rural， isolated setting?\n\n【55】Steve would have similar follow-up even if he lived in a rural area， although referral to a mental health clinician may be more difficult and he may have to travel a distance to a clinic.\n\n【56】Are there any standardized guidelines that you should use to assess or treat this case?

This patient demonstrates the classic presentation of pyloric stenosis with immediate postprandial，nonbilious， often projectile vomiting (\"the hungry vomiter\") and a palpable olive-like mass in the epigastrium. Firstborn white males are more at risk than other populations.  |\n| What are the typical laboratory findings in this condition?

These agents cause double-strand breaks in DNA， which are repaired by one of two main mecha-nisms： nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or homologous recombination repair.NHEJ can join DNA ends with little sequence homology to each other and can occur during the Go， Gi， and G2-M phases of the cell cycle. In contrast， homologous recombination repair uses a sister chromatid as a template for repair-ing the broken DNA. Because of the need for a sister chromatid， homologous recombination repair occurs only during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle， after a chromosome has been replicated. Some of the same DNA repair proteins are used in both NHEJ and homologous recombination repair\n\n【3】In many， but not all， instances， repair of DNA double-strand breaks begins with the recruitment of a protein complex， the MRE11：RAD50：NBS1 (MRN) complex， to the site of the break. The MRN complex facilitates the accumulation of the additional proteins necessary for DNA repair. One of the first proteins recruited by the MRN complex is the ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) protein， which is a serine/threonine kinase. ATM exists as an inactive dimer constitutively bound to a phosphatase that negatively regulates ATM kinase activity. When ATM binds to double-strand DNA breaks， the phosphatase is released. ATM then undergoes autophosphorylation and dissociation into active monomers .\n\n【4】On activation， ATM phosphorylates a large number of downstream proteins involved in DNA repair. Activation of these ATM substrates results in cell-cycle\n删除3：<u>Fig. 21.1 Two methods of repairing 删除换行 double-strand DNA breaks. In nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ)(left)， a complex of DNA repair proteins binds to the broken DNA ends. The broken ends are first processed by nucleases and DNA polymerases to remove or fill in single-stranded overhangs， and the blunt ends are then ligated. NHEJ usually leads to the deletion or insertion of nucleotides at the site of the break. An NHEJ-type repair process is used in the ligation of gene segments in V(D)J recombination and in class-switch recombination.In DNA repair by homologous recombination(right)， nucleases recruited by a complex of DNA repair proteins transform the broken ends into longer single-stranded overhangs. One strand invades the DNA of the sister chromatid， which is used as a template to repair the DNA break. Unlike NHEJ， homologous recombination uses sequence homology to repair the DNA.</u>\n删除3：<u>Fig. 21.2 Activation of ATM. The MRN complex binds to double-strand DNA breaks and recruits the protein kinase ATM， which exists in the cytoplasm as an inactive dimer complexed with an inhibitory phosphatase PP2A. ATM activation involves the release of PP2A， which enables the autophosphorylation of ATM and its dissociation into enzymatically active monomers.</u>\n\n【5】arrest and DNA repair， or in apoptosis if the DNA cannot be repaired. Redundancy in cellular DNA repair mechanisms permits some DNA repair to occur even in the complete absence of ATM. However， cells lacking ATM do not repair every break， and so double-strand breaks accumulate over time， which is manifested as an abnormal sensitivity of cells to ionizing radiation and the accumulation of chro-mosomalabnormalities，\n\n【6】In addition to its use as a general means of DNA repair， some components of the NHEJ pathway are involved in the rejoining of gene segments to create the sig-nal and coding joints during V(D)J recombination in the immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes. Consistent with this， mutations in the genes encoding for Artemis， DNA protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs)， DNA ligase 4 (LIG4)， and Cernunnos/XLF are responsible for combined immune deficiency with impaired development of T and B lymphocytes . NHEJ is also thought to be the means by which the double-strand breaks produced in the immunoglob-ulin C-region genes during class-switch recombination are resolved. Both ATM-dependent and ATM-independent pathways operate in these repair processes. As we will see in this case， a genetic deficiency of ATM can result in a constellation of symptoms resulting from the inability to repair DNA， including immunodeficiency.\n\n【7】Basil Ransom was 6 years old when he was referred to the Children’s Hospital because of a history of recurrent ear infections and two pneumonias. Even after placement of ear tubes to ventilate the middle ear and prevent the accumulation of fluid and infections， he continued to have monthly infections. On physical examina- tion he was noted to have a wobbly gait (ataxia) and two dilated superficial blood 删除换行 vessels (telangiectasias) on his conjunctivae and the outer part of his ear (the pinna). The pediatrician tested Basil’s serum immunoglobulins and found total IgG to be low at 219 mg dl-1 (normal 600-1500 mg dl-) with no detectable lgG2 and lgG4， no detectable lgA， and an elevated level of IgM of 205 mg d-1 (normal 22-100 mg dl-l). Basil had a positive antibody titer to only 1 of 14 pneumococcal (Streptococcus pneumoniae) subtypes tested， and no detectable antibodies against Haemophilus influenzae， although he had received both the pneumococcal and H. influenzae vaccines. His antibody titer to tetanus was normal.\n\n【8】At the Children's Hospital， a fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of Basil's peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was notable for low numbers of CD4+ T cells (459 cells ul-； normal 700-2200 ul-1)，CD8+ T cells (221 cells pl-； normal 490-1300 ul-)， and B cells (300 cells ul-1； normal 390-1400 ul-1). Prolif-eration of Basil's PBMCs in response to phytohemagglutinin was reduced， but not absent (32，000 counts per minute； normal values 125，000-290，000 cpm). Because of the history of recurrent infections， ataxia， telangiectasias， hypogammaglobuline-mia， and lymphopenia， the diagnosis of ataxia-telangiectasia was considered and blood alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was measured. AFP is a plasma protein produced by the liver that is elevated in ataxia-telangiectasia，although not exclusively so. Basil’s AFP level was elevated， at 64 ng ml- (normal 0-15 ng ml-).\n\n【9】To assess radiosensitivity，lymphoblastoid B-cell lines were established from Basil's blood and from a normal individual as a control. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were isolated and transformed with Epstein-Barr virus. For each sample， the transformed lymphoblastoid cells were split into two plates； one plate was exposed to 10 Grays of radiation and the other was not irradiated. After 10 days in culture， the number of surviving colonies was counted. The survival fraction was calculated by compar- ing the number of surviving colonies in the irradiated plate with that of the nonir- radiated plate. The normal control had a survival fraction of 45%， whereas Basil's survival fraction was only 12% . Sequencing of Basil’s ATM gene revealed that he was a compound heterozygote for two different mutations； that is， he had one mutation in one ATM allele and a different mutation in the other allele.\n删除3：<u>Fig. 21.3 Telangiectasias on the conjunctiva and pinna of the ear in a patient with ataxia telangiectasia.</u>\n\n【10】Recurrent infections and telangiectasias on conjunctivae and ears.\n\n【11】Undetectable serum lgA.

Although the cerebellum is affected first and most severely， the accumulation of damaged DNA in neuronal cells becomes more widespread and results in losSOt gross and fine motor skills， dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing)， dysarthria (speech difficulty)， abnormal eye movements， and peripheral neuropathy and nerve dys-function. Although ataxia is associated with several neurologic disorders， the combination of ataxia with telangiectasias on the conjunctivae or pinnae is charac-teristic ofataxia-telangiectasia. Another identifying feature of the disease is the ele vated AFP level， which is usually more than two standard deviations above normal.\n\n【14】Patients with ataxia-telangiectasia can have a variety of defects in humoral and cellular immunity. ATM mutations may affect B-cell and T-cell development and function， leading to low numbers of B cells and T cells， most probably owing to deleterious effects on V(D)J recombination. In some cases， T cell lymphopenia is present at birth， evident by abnormally low levels ofT cell receptor excision circles(TRECs) at newborn screening for SCID . As a result of ATM mutations that impair class-switch recombination， patients may have elevated IgM levels but decreased IgA， IgG， or IgE levels and a poor response to polysaccharide antigens. Consequently， these patients experience frequent infections of sinuses andlungs(sinopulmonary infections) by bacteria such as S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae. Lymphocyte proliferation in response to mitogens and antigens can vary from nor-mal to impaired. However， unlike patients with ionizing radiation-sensitive severe combined immunodeficiency (IR-SCID) resulting from a deficiency of NHEJ com ponents that are essential for V(D)J recombination， patients with ataxia-telangiec-tasia are not typically at increased risk of opportunistic infections， indicating the preservation of some immune function， especially T-cell function.\n\n【15】Patients with ataxia-telangiectasia have a significantly increased risk of leukemias andlymphomas. As T cells and B cells routinely incur DNA double-strand breaks during antigen-receptor gene formation and class-switch recombination， the translocations most commonly found in these leukemias and lymphomas involve T-cell receptor genes and immunoglobulin genes on the one hand and oncogenes on the other. Translocations juxtaposing an active T-cell enhancer in the TCRlocus with an oncogene offer a growth advantage to these abnormal cells， resulting in clonal expansion. Although lymphoma and leukemia constitute the majority of cancers in patients with ataxia-telangiectasia， there is also an increased risk ofsolid organ cancers， such as breast cancer. The defective repair of double-strand breaks caused byionizing radiation is the primary cause of tumors in those patients.\n\n【16】Mutations in proteins that cooperate with ATM cause clinical phenotypes that overlap with ataxia-telangiectasia. Hypomorphic mutations (mutations caus-ing decreased， but not absent， production and/or function of the protein) in the MREll gene， which encodes a component ofthe MRN complex， result in a disease resembling a mild form of ataxia-telangiectasia with delayed onset and slower pro-gression of symptoms. Another component of the MRN complex， nibrin， binds to double-strand DNA breaks. Mutations in the gene encoding nibrin， NBS1， cause Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS)， which is characterized by radiosensitivity， an increased risk of leukemia and lymphoma， and immunodeficiency. Patients with NBS also have microcephaly， mental retardation， short stature， and facial dys-morphisms (long and beaked nose， prominent midface， sloping forehead， microg-nathia， and large ears)， but do not have ataxia .\n\n【17】Medical interventions for ataxia-telangiectasia are supportive， because no tar geted treatment exists for this disease. The median age of death is 25 years， caused most often by cancer or progressive pulmonary disease resulting from recurrent infections. Therefore， antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered in patients with repeated sinopulmonary infections； pulmonary function should be monitored. Infusions of gamma globulin should be administered to patients with hypogam-maglobulinemia or impaired specific antibody production. Most importantly， exposure to ionizing radiation in diagnostic studies should be minimized.\n\n【18】Questions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 11:41:37", "endTime": "2024/09/12 11:43:25", "cost": 108.878}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:29", "update_time": "2024-09-11 19:43:25", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 19:41:36"}

A gastric ulcer that is refractory to medical therapy after 4 months should be considered for surgical therapy. The operation to be performed can be excision of the ulcer and vagotomy with drainage procedure or a partial gastrectomy that includes the ulcer and the distal stomach. H. pylori eradica-tion with ulcer medication should be the treatment for the patients described in choices A and C. The treatment for the patient with NSAID-associated gastric erosion is medical therapy with PPI and misoprostol.\n\n【49】17.2 C. Chronic gastric outlet obstruction associated with PUD is an indication for surgical treatment which can be either vagotomy with drainage or vagotomy with antrectomy. Patients with PUD taking NSAIDs can be managed with H. pylori treatment and PPI. Occult GI bleeding does not necessarily require surgical treatment.\n\n【50】17.3(C. Patients with NSAIDs-induced ulcers are not uncommonly associated with H. pylori. If infection is documented，treatment will include antibiotics to eradicate H. pylori and antisecretory medication (PPI). PPI is much more effective than H， antagonist in reducing gastric acid production.\n\n【51】17.4 B. Duodenal ulcer pathogenesis can be multifactorial. The end result is generally hyperacidic gastroduodenal environment that can be aggravated by H. pylori infections and perhaps low blood flow conditions (eg， shock-related ulcers and stress-related ulcers).\n\n【52】17.5 A. The patient described has a type I gastric ulcer and this ulcer is not usually contributed to by hyperacidity. Type II ulcers are classic gastric ulcer and duodenal ulcer and are related to hyperacidity. Type III ulcer is a prepyloric ulcer related to hyperacidity and pyloric emptying dysfunction. Type IV is a proximal gastroesophageal ulcer. Type V ulcer is an NSAID-induced mucosal ulcer that can occur in any location in the stomach.\n\n【53】17.6 B. Ulcer surgeries are highly effective at reducing acid production from the stomach. The drawbacks of surgical treatment are motility disorders affect-ing gastric emptying and reduction in gastric capacity. Surgical treatment is most commonly performed today to address bleeding that is refractory to medical interventions and to address perforated ulcer disease.\n\n【54】17.7B. The patient with an apparent gastric ulcer undergoes medical therapy and3 months later， develops gastric outlet obstruction. A plausible explanation for this sequence of events is that the gastric ulcer thought to be benign in nature is actually a gastric malignancy that has progressed over the ensu-ing 3 months to cause gastric outlet obstruction.\n\n【55】17.8D. Patients who develop recurrent ulcers following vagotomy and antrectomy suggest unusual causes of their ulcer diseases such as excess gastrin produc-tion related to gastrinomas (Z ollinger-Ellison syndrome).

She has a history notable for poorly controlled diabetes mellitus and had started a course of sulfamethoxazole–trimethoprim and ciprofloxacin for cellulitis of the right foot 8 days ago. On examination, there are large confluent areas of dusky erythema, flaccid bullae and denudation. There are also oral mucosal erosions around and inside the mouth and bilateral conjunctival injection. She is admitted to the hospital and continues to develop large confluent areas of dusky erythema on the trunk and extremities with a cigarette paper-like texture ( 75a ) with new blister formation and progression of denudation ( 75b , c ) involving 70% of the total body surface area.\n\n【4】i. What is the diagnosis?\n\n【5】ii. What are the most common causes of this disorder, and what populations, if any, may be at risk?\n\n【6】iii. What are the complications and sequelae of this disease?\n\n【7】iv. What criteria can be used to predict mortality and what treatments are available?\n\n【8】Answer 75\n\n【9】i. The patient presents with toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), a severe mucocutaneous disease in the same spectrum as Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS). TEN has an average mortality between 25% and 35%. SJS/TEN is almost always due to drug exposures and is caused by massive keratinocyte death, which leads to separation of the skin at the dermal–epidermal junction. It presents typically with a prodrome of symptoms including fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis and/or conjunctivitis, which can precede the skin findings by several days. The cutaneous manifestations of SJS/TEN include erythema and erosions that favour the trunk and face and later may involve the extremities. The oral, ocular and genital mucosae are involved in the vast majority of cases.\n\n【10】During progression of the disease, the erythematous patches appear dusky and may take on a grey hue that represents epidermal necrosis. Large areas of skin can resemble wet cigarette paper that sloughs off with minor friction or trauma (Nikolsky’s sign). Flaccid blisters demonstrate the Asboe-Hansen sign, which is the extension of the blister sideways by slight pressure of the thumb due to the lateral displacement of necrotic epidermis.\n\n【11】The distinction between SJS and TEN is made upon the total body surface area (BSA) involved. SJS involves <10% of BSA, SJS/TEN overlap involves 10%–30% of BSA and TEN involves >30% of BSA.\n\n【12】ii. Medications that are most often associated with SJS/TEN include antimicrobials (aminopenicillins and trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole), antiretroviral medications (particularly non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors), allopurinol and anti-epileptic drugs (carbamazepine, phenytoin, lamotrigine and barbiturates).\n\n【13】SJS/TEN is a rare disease that has a slightly higher incidence in women. Populations at risk for developing SJS/TEN are those with slow acetylator genotypes, immunocompromised individuals or those undergoing radiotherapy, and patients on anticonvulsants. The risk of TEN is up to 1000-fold higher in individuals with AIDS than in the general population. In addition, specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles have been identified as higher risk. HLA-B\\1502 in Asians and East Indians has been linked with a higher risk of SJS/TEN after exposure to carbamazepine, and HLA-B\\5801 in Han Chinese has been linked with a higher risk after exposure to allopurinol.\n\n【14】iii. Areas of detached epidermis typically heal with re-epithelialization occurring within 3 weeks without any need for skin grafting. However, it is important to consult ophthalmology, gynecology and/or urology for the evaluation of mucosal involvement, as the manifestations on the mucosal surfaces can lead to sequelae such as symblepharon, conjunctival synechiae, entropion or blindness in the eyes and phimosis or vaginal synechiae in the genital mucosae.\n\n【15】iv. The SCORTEN scale is a severity-of-illness score that can be used in patients with TEN to predict mortality. It is based on seven independent risk factors for high mortality and is assessed at the time of presentation.

The owners noticed a mass in her mouth when she yawned . Prednisone and antihistamine treatment was started 1 week prior to presentation; however, it was noted that she was having difficulty eating. There were no other abnormalities noted by the owners. She was on the same diet and housed in the same enclosure as the other tigers.\n删除3：<u>Fig. 32.1 A comparison of normal tiger (on the left) and tiger with lesion when yawning (one the right).Physical Examination Findings</u>\n\n【3】An estimated 100-kg Bengal tiger appeared normal when viewed in her travel trailer enclosure that also contained eight other tigers. She was bright, alert, and responsive. In order to perform a more thorough physical examination, injectable anesthetics were necessary. Medetomidine (1 mg), midazolam (10 mg), and ketamine (400 mg) were administered intramuscularly using a spring-loaded pole syringe. Twenty minutes following the delivery of these drugs, the tiger was administered isoflurane via face mask briefly prior to intubation (16 mm endotracheal) and maintenance with isoflurane anesthesia.\n\n【4】Two 2.5-3.0 cm raised, round, well-circumscribed masses were found on the caudal soft palate  There were no other abnormalities noted on physical examination.

Figure 32.4a shows three eosinophils, a neutrophil, and a lymphocyte. Figure 32.4b shows eight neutrophils, two eosinophils, and a mast cell. The differential of cells on the slide was 46% eosinophils, 38% neutrophils, 10% lymphocytes, 6% large mononuclear cells, and a small number of mast cells. Due to the relatively low number of mast cells, this lesion was more likely a granuloma than a tumor.

The  删除换行 hypertrophic scar never gets worse after 6 months, but  删除换行 a true keloid continues to get worse even after 1 year. \n\n【3】It is characterised by proliferation of immature  删除换行 fibroblasts and also immature blood vessels. A keloid  删除换行 has claw-like processes. It looks smooth, pink and raised  删除换行 patch. A keloid is unsightly, often tender to touch andSKIN AND SUBCUTANEOUS TISSUE 33 删除换行 always itch. The most charac-teristic feature of keloid  删除换行 is that it recurs even when it is excised.\n\n【4】AETIOLOGY.— There are a few aetiological 删除换行 factors which may cause  删除换行 keloid. These are :\n\n【5】1. Coloured races  删除换行 are particularly liable to  删除换行 keloid formation. Negroes  删除换行 are commonly affected.\n\n【6】2. It is a familial  删除换行 condition.\n\n【7】3. It is more  删除换行 common in women.\n\n【8】4. Tuberculosis plays  删除换行 a role in aetiology. \n\n【9】Patients with tuberculosis  删除换行 often suffer from keloid  删除换行 formation.\n\n【10】5. Local factors e.g. if the incision crosses the \n\n【11】Langer's lines keloid formation is more common.\n\n【12】6. Dislocation of hair follicles is also a factor which  删除换行 is more often seen in burns.\n\n【13】PATHOLOGY.— The basic pathology of keloid is  删除换行 proliferation of immature fibroblasts and immature blood  删除换行 vessels around the base of the sebaceous and sweat glands. \n\n【14】These cells gradually infiltrate into the surrounding tissues  删除换行 and proliferation continues. Due to the claw-like  删除换行 encroachment into the surrounding tissues with  删除换行 proliferation of cells this condition is called keloid. \n\n【15】Presence of plenty of immature blood vessels causes  删除换行 pinkish colour of keloid with itching and blanching.\n\n【16】CLINICAL FEATURES.— Keloid may occur  删除换行 following incisional scar, burns or simple pin-prick or  删除换行 following resolution of an abscess or of a boil or even  删除换行 in the ear lobe after piercing. It is more common in \n\n【17】Afro-Carribean individuals. It is a raised swelling from  删除换行 the surface. It extends beyond the original scar in all  删除换行 directions with claw-like processes. This encroachment  删除换行 continues even after 1 year of the scar. It is slight  删除换行 pinkish in colour due to presence of capillaries. Patient  删除换行 often complains of itching and as she itches,  删除换行 serosanguineous fluid may ooze out. It is slightly warm  删除换行 and often slightly tender to touch.\n\n【18】KELOID\n\n【19】1. Recurrence of this condition.\n\n【20】2. Ulceration.\n\n【21】3. There may be very occasionally malignant change  删除换行 seen at the margin (Marjolin's ulcer), which has been  删除换行 denied by many surgeons.\n\n【22】4. Infection.\n\n【23】COM PLICA TIONS.—\n\n【24】I. According to the mode of origin —\n\n【25】(i) Acquired variety;\n\n【26】(ii) Spontaneous variety, which is quite rare. \n\n【27】Patient fails to give any history of previous injury. This  删除换行 is common in Negroes and Afro-Carribeans. Butterfly  删除换行 keloid in the region of the chest is sometimes  删除换行 spontaneous.\n\n【28】II. According to the growth of keloid —\n\n【29】(a) Progressive — when the keloid progresses with  删除换行 claw-like processes for quite a long time. It is pink,  删除换行 slightly tender, itching and oozing.\n\n【30】(b) Non-progressive -— when the keloid stops  删除换行 progressing after 6 months or so into the surrounding  删除换行 tissues, it is called non-progressive variety.\n\n【31】TREATMENT.— Treatment is extremely difficult.\n\n【32】Conservative treatment.—\n\n【33】1. Intrakeloidal injection of steroid is helpful and  删除换行 should be considered as the best treatment. Injection \n\n【34】Kenacort seems to be quite good in this regard.\n\n【35】2. Intrakeloidal hialuronidase injection may be tried.\n\n【36】3. Intrakeloidal injection of Vitamin A has given  删除换行 some better result.\n\n【37】4. Intrakeloidal injection of Methotrexate has been  删除换行 used with some success.\n\n【38】5. Deep X-ray therapy has also debatable success. It  删除换行 suppresses further proliferation of immature fibroblasts and  删除换行 blood vessels. So it may stop further growth of the  删除换行 keloid and stop itching.\n\n【39】6. Ultrasonic therapy has recently been tried with  删除换行 some success.\n\n【40】Surgery.—\n\n【41】1. Excision and resuturing is often followed by  删除换行 recurrence. Preoperative radiotherapy and postoperative  删除换行 radiotherapy prevent recurrence rate but the total efficacy  删除换行 of such treatment is not very much encouraging.\n\n【42】2. Shaving away the excess scar tissue and then  删除换行 resurfacing the area by a thin skin graft, though  删除换行 advocated by a few surgeons to give encouraging results,  删除换行 yet such treatment has never produced good results by  删除换行 large. Care should be taken not to extend the incision  删除换行 into the normal tissue at any point.\n\n【43】TYPES.—\nIn case of deep burns involving full thickness of  删除换行 skin, epithelialisation is not possible and healing occurs  删除换行 by fibrosis. In these cases skin grafting is required  删除换行 immediately. If this resurfacing is not done, the burn  删除换行 heals by scarring. When such scarring matures,  删除换行 contracture occurs, which is known as post burn\n删除3：<u>Fig. 1.27.— Keloid in front of  删除换行 the chest.</u>\n\n【44】删除27：<u>334 A TEXTBOOK ON SURGICAL SHORT CASES</u>\n\n【45】contracture. It takes about 6 months to 1 year for  删除换行 maturation.\n\n【46】In some cases of superficial burn, when it is infected  删除换行 it causes sloughing of deeper tissues. This also heals by  删除换行 fibrosis leading to post burn contracture.\n\n【47】It causes great cosmetic problem. Anatomical  删除换行 movements of the joint are restricted, if such contracture  删除换行 occurs around joints. Whenever it occurs it limits  删除换行 movements of the area.\n\n【48】Prevention.—\n\n【49】Post burn contracture can be prevented by treating  删除换行 deep burns properly and in time. Any deep burn requires  删除换行 skin grafting as soon as the wound starts granulating. \n\n【50】This can be performed by split thickness skin grafting or  删除换行 by flap skin grafting. After skin grafting the affected area  删除换行 should be properly splinted. Physiotherapy should be  删除换行 advised to prevent graft contracture.\n\n【51】In case of superficial burn, care should be taken that  删除换行 the burned area is not infected by giving prophylactive  删除换行 antibiotics also keeping the area clean. If the burn is  删除换行 near a joint, it should be properly splinted to prevent  删除换行 development of contracture.\n\n【52】Treatment.—\n\n【53】Once the burn contracture has developed, treatment  删除换行 is operation and it should be done under general  删除换行 anaesthesia.\n\n【54】The principle of treatment is either to excise the  删除换行 contracture or to release the contracture by Z-plasty. If  删除换行 the contracture can be excised, it is followed by full  删除换行 thickness skin graft. After that the joints around the  删除换行 contracture are properly splinted. If the contracture is  删除换行 released by Z-plasty, the limb is then splinted properly so  删除换行 that no further contracture is possible.\n\n【55】Postoperative care is mainly applying splints when the  删除换行 contracture is near a joint. In case of axilla, abduction  删除换行 splint is applied for 4 to 6 months, in case of elbow and  删除换行 knee, splints are applied with slight flexion of the joint  删除换行 for 4 to 6 months. In case of wrist, splint is applied  删除换行 keeping the wrist in slight extension position for 4  删除换行 months. In case of hand, it is kept in position of function  删除换行 with proper splint for 3 months. In case of fingers, these  删除换行 are kept in flexion in the position of function for 3  删除换行 months. In case of neck, a moulded cervical collar is  删除换行 applied for 6 months.\n\n【56】Physiotherapy is particularly important in the  删除换行 postoperative period in the limb contracture.\n\n【57】SOLAR KERATOSIS (SYN. SENILE\n\n【58】KERATOSIS)\n\n【59】Prolonged exposure to sunlight will cause  删除换行 hyperkeratosis of the skin, which is known as solar 删除换行 keratosis. This condition often takes malignant change. \n\n【60】POST BURN CONTRACTURE\n\n【61】(i) The patients are usually above middle age. \n\n【62】They have usually worked out of doors for many years. \n\n【63】Majority are fair-skinned individuals.\n\n【64】(ii) Patient notices appearance of thickened patches  删除换行 of the skin. These may occur in multiple.\n\n【65】(iii) These are usually seen on the face, back and  删除换行 on the hands.\n\n【66】HISTORY.—\n\n【67】The thickened patches are yellowish-grey or sometimes  删除换行 brown in colour. Usually the lesions are less than 1 cm  删除换行 in diameter. They have a dry hard scale on the surface  删除换行 of the lesion.\n\n【68】It is a hard lesion which is firmly adherent to the 删除换行 skin.\n\n【69】Careful watch must be kept to note if the lesion is  删除换行 undergoing malignant change or not. If the patch or nodule  删除换行 is tethered to the underlying structures, it is turning to  删除换行 malignancy. This condition is potentially malignant. It may  删除换行 take about 10 years to become malignant. It usually  删除换行 becomes squamous cell carcinoma, which is of slow  删除换行 growing nature with little tendency to metastasise.\n\n【70】Lymph nodes are never palpable in solar keratosis as  删除换行 such. If regional lymph nodes are palpable, it is sure that  删除换行 the lesion has turned malignant.\n\n【71】TREATMENT.— Avoidance of sunlight is particularly  删除换行 important prophylactically and may cause improvement of  删除换行 this condition. Best treatment is removal by freezing with  删除换行 carbondioxide or liquid nitrogen. The lesion may be  删除换行 destroyed by curettage and cautery, though it may leave  删除换行 scarring. Thick lesions should be surgically excised. Lesion  删除换行 in the face may particularly be treated by 5-fluorouracil  删除换行 cream.\n\n【72】KAPOSI’S SARCOMA\n\n【73】In this condition multiple red-purple plaques and  删除换行 nodules appear on the legs. It is a rare condition of  删除换行 cutaneous sarcoma. It is a slow growing malignant  删除换行 mesenchymal tumour.\n\n【74】PATHOLOGY.— The main histologic features of \n\n【75】Kaposi's sarcoma are proliferation of groups of spindle删除8：<u>￾</u>shaped, somewhat pleomorphic cells, having prominent  删除换行 dark nuclei; proliferation of small vessels lined with  删除换行 endothelial cells having large hyperchromatic nuclei and  删除换行 presence of red blood cells in slit-like spaces not lined  删除换行 by endothelial cells. Inflammatory cells including  删除换行 lymphocytes, plasma cells and large mononuclear cells  删除换行 are often present alongwith haemosiderin-laden  删除换行 macrophages.SKIN AND SUBCUTANEOUS TISSUE 35\n\n【76】CLINICAL FEATURES.— This condition is mainly  删除换行 seen in the middle age or above (40 to 70 years). \n\n【77】Males are predominantly involved (male to female ratio  删除换行 is 10 : 1). It is quite rare in most parts of the world  删除换行 accounting for only 0.01% to 0.02% of all malignant  删除换行 tumours. However this is more common in Italy, Eastern \n\n【78】Europe and in certain parts of Africa. Initially, lesions  删除换行 of Kaposi's sarcoma appear as multiple or very rarely  删除换行 single, red papules in the skin of the lower legs. It  删除换行 commonly involves the feet, occasionally the hands, ear  删除换行 or nose. This can however occur anywhere in the skin. \n\n【79】This is a painless lesion. In course of time these lesions  删除换行 enlarge and coalesce forming purple-red spongy nodules  删除换行 as big as 7 cm or more. Pressure may produce  删除换行 blanching to reveal a brown tinge. These become  删除换行 ulcerated in the long run and infected. Signs of systemic  删除换行 lymphosarcoma, enlarged lymph nodes and  删除换行 hepatosplenomegaly are the characteristic features of these  删除换行 conditions. Internal organs like intestine may also be  删除换行 involved. Haemorrhage from intestinal lesion is a  删除换行 common complication. Occasionally, particularly in \n\n【80】African countries, children may be affected when the  删除换行 lymph node involvement precedes cutaneous and visceral  删除换行 lesions. Cervical lymph nodes and salivary glands are  删除换行 usually first involved and it is an aggressive condition. \n\n【81】This tumour has been associated with haemolytic  删除换行 anaemia, lymphoma, diabetes mellitus and  删除换行 immunosuppression (HIV infection or AIDS).\n\n【82】TREATMENT.— Treatment for small lesion is  删除换行 surgical excision. As these tumours are radiosensitive,  删除换行 radiotherapy may be used. In case of larger lesions  删除换行 radiotherapy may be used with chemotherapy.\n\n【83】BOWEN'S DISEASE\n\n【84】The main interest of this disease is that it is  删除换行 precancerous. It usually presents as a progressive flat \n\n【85】(non-elevated), pink scaly papular patches which are  删除换行 covered with crust. When the crust is removed the  删除换行 papules can be seen oozy with bloody surface. This  删除换行 condition is often wrongly considered as eczema by the  删除换行 patients. It is a rare condition. It occurs equally on  删除换行 the exposed and covered areas.\n\n【86】PATHOLOGY.— Histologically in this condition  删除换行 there is proliferation of atypical squamous cells  删除换行 throughout the whole thickness of the epidermis. Cells  删除换行 are prematurely keratinised. It often mimics Paget s  删除换行 disease of the breast. By the time this disease has  删除换行 been diagnosed, possibly Vith of the cases will have  删除换行 cancers elsewhere in the body either in the respiratory 删除换行 system or gastrointestinal tract or genitourinary system. \n\n【87】About Vz of the patients with Bowen's disease develop  删除换行 malignant cancer of the skin within 7 years.\n\n【88】CLINICAL FEATURES.-— The initial lesion is a  删除换行 small red scaly area which gradually enlarges. When the  删除换行 scale is removed it looks oozy and red. The lesion is  删除换行 usually flat and the margins are sharp. The lesion may  删除换行 occur anywhere in the body. Ulceration is a sign of  删除换行 malignancy. Biopsy is a must to establish diagnosis.\n\n【89】TREATMENT.— Initial lesion can be treated by  删除换行 cryotherapy or curettage and cauterisation. When the  删除换行 lesion has taken a definite shape, surgical excision is the  删除换行 best treatment if it is not too large. Radiotherapy may  删除换行 be applied for relatively bigger lesion. Chemotherapy with  删除换行 5-fluorouracil may be applied to small lesions.\n\n【90】EXAMINATIONS.—\nIn all wounds capillary loops at the base form the  删除换行 granulation tissue. If chronic infection stimulates the  删除换行 capillary loops to grow too vigorously a protruding mass  删除换行 develops covered with epithelium. This is a pyogenic 删除换行 granuloma. It is dull red, soft or firm and more or less  删除换行 pedunculated nodule which grows rapidly to about 2 cm  删除换行 in diameter. The patient usually complains of a rapidly 删除换行 growing swelling on the skin which bleeds easily and  删除换行 discharges serous or purulent fluid. The growth is so  删除换行 rapid that it attains about double the size in a few  删除换行 days.\n\n【91】Pyogenic granuloma can occur anywhere in the skin  删除换行 but is most commonly seen on the face, the fingers and  删除换行 the toes, the parts which are likely to be injured. \n\n【92】Although they are not typically painful, they are slightly  删除换行 tender. These are usually soft and are slightly  删除换行 compressible. The lump bleeds easily when touched. \n\n【93】Regional lymph nodes may be enlarged when such lesion  删除换行 is highly infected.\n\n【94】TREATMENT is excision.CHAPTER\n\n【95】ULCER, SINUS AND FISTULA \n\n【96】(INCLUDING PILONIDAL SINUS)删除5：<u> 2</u>\nPYOGENIC GRANULOMA\n\n【97】An ulcer is a break in the continuity of the covering  删除换行 epithelium — skin or mucous membrane.

Dislocation of hair follicles is also a factor which  删除换行 is more often seen in burns.\n\n【13】PATHOLOGY.— The basic pathology of keloid is  删除换行 proliferation of immature fibroblasts and immature blood  删除换行 vessels around the base of the sebaceous and sweat glands. \n\n【14】These cells gradually infiltrate into the surrounding tissues  删除换行 and proliferation continues. Due to the claw-like  删除换行 encroachment into the surrounding tissues with  删除换行 proliferation of cells this condition is called keloid. \n\n【15】Presence of plenty of immature blood vessels causes  删除换行 pinkish colour of keloid with itching and blanching.\n\n【16】CLINICAL FEATURES.— Keloid may occur  删除换行 following incisional scar, burns or simple pin-prick or  删除换行 following resolution of an abscess or of a boil or even  删除换行 in the ear lobe after piercing. It is more common in \n\n【17】Afro-Carribean individuals. It is a raised swelling from  删除换行 the surface. It extends beyond the original scar in all  删除换行 directions with claw-like processes. This encroachment  删除换行 continues even after 1 year of the scar. It is slight  删除换行 pinkish in colour due to presence of capillaries. Patient  删除换行 often complains of itching and as she itches,  删除换行 serosanguineous fluid may ooze out. It is slightly warm  删除换行 and often slightly tender to touch.\n\n【18】KELOID\n\n【19】1. Recurrence of this condition.\n\n【20】2. Ulceration.\n\n【21】3. There may be very occasionally malignant change  删除换行 seen at the margin (Marjolin's ulcer), which has been  删除换行 denied by many surgeons.\n\n【22】4. Infection.\n\n【23】COM PLICA TIONS.—\n\n【24】I. According to the mode of origin —\n\n【25】(i) Acquired variety;\n\n【26】(ii) Spontaneous variety, which is quite rare. \n\n【27】Patient fails to give any history of previous injury. This  删除换行 is common in Negroes and Afro-Carribeans. Butterfly  删除换行 keloid in the region of the chest is sometimes  删除换行 spontaneous.\n\n【28】II. According to the growth of keloid —\n\n【29】(a) Progressive — when the keloid progresses with  删除换行 claw-like processes for quite a long time. It is pink,  删除换行 slightly tender, itching and oozing.\n\n【30】(b) Non-progressive -— when the keloid stops  删除换行 progressing after 6 months or so into the surrounding  删除换行 tissues, it is called non-progressive variety.\n\n【31】TREATMENT.— Treatment is extremely difficult.\n\n【32】Conservative treatment.—\n\n【33】1. Intrakeloidal injection of steroid is helpful and  删除换行 should be considered as the best treatment. Injection \n\n【34】Kenacort seems to be quite good in this regard.\n\n【35】2. Intrakeloidal hialuronidase injection may be tried.\n\n【36】3. Intrakeloidal injection of Vitamin A has given  删除换行 some better result.\n\n【37】4. Intrakeloidal injection of Methotrexate has been  删除换行 used with some success.\n\n【38】5. Deep X-ray therapy has also debatable success. It  删除换行 suppresses further proliferation of immature fibroblasts and  删除换行 blood vessels. So it may stop further growth of the  删除换行 keloid and stop itching.\n\n【39】6. Ultrasonic therapy has recently been tried with  删除换行 some success.\n\n【40】Surgery.—\n\n【41】1. Excision and resuturing is often followed by  删除换行 recurrence. Preoperative radiotherapy and postoperative  删除换行 radiotherapy prevent recurrence rate but the total efficacy  删除换行 of such treatment is not very much encouraging.\n\n【42】2. Shaving away the excess scar tissue and then  删除换行 resurfacing the area by a thin skin graft, though  删除换行 advocated by a few surgeons to give encouraging results,  删除换行 yet such treatment has never produced good results by  删除换行 large. Care should be taken not to extend the incision  删除换行 into the normal tissue at any point.\n\n【43】TYPES.—\nIn case of deep burns involving full thickness of  删除换行 skin, epithelialisation is not possible and healing occurs  删除换行 by fibrosis. In these cases skin grafting is required  删除换行 immediately. If this resurfacing is not done, the burn  删除换行 heals by scarring. When such scarring matures,  删除换行 contracture occurs, which is known as post burn\n删除3：<u>Fig. 1.27.— Keloid in front of  删除换行 the chest.</u>\n\n【44】删除27：<u>334 A TEXTBOOK ON SURGICAL SHORT CASES</u>\n\n【45】contracture. It takes about 6 months to 1 year for  删除换行 maturation.\n\n【46】In some cases of superficial burn, when it is infected  删除换行 it causes sloughing of deeper tissues. This also heals by  删除换行 fibrosis leading to post burn contracture.\n\n【47】It causes great cosmetic problem. Anatomical  删除换行 movements of the joint are restricted, if such contracture  删除换行 occurs around joints. Whenever it occurs it limits  删除换行 movements of the area.\n\n【48】Prevention.—\n\n【49】Post burn contracture can be prevented by treating  删除换行 deep burns properly and in time. Any deep burn requires  删除换行 skin grafting as soon as the wound starts granulating. \n\n【50】This can be performed by split thickness skin grafting or  删除换行 by flap skin grafting. After skin grafting the affected area  删除换行 should be properly splinted. Physiotherapy should be  删除换行 advised to prevent graft contracture.\n\n【51】In case of superficial burn, care should be taken that  删除换行 the burned area is not infected by giving prophylactive  删除换行 antibiotics also keeping the area clean. If the burn is  删除换行 near a joint, it should be properly splinted to prevent  删除换行 development of contracture.\n\n【52】Treatment.—\n\n【53】Once the burn contracture has developed, treatment  删除换行 is operation and it should be done under general  删除换行 anaesthesia.\n\n【54】The principle of treatment is either to excise the  删除换行 contracture or to release the contracture by Z-plasty. If  删除换行 the contracture can be excised, it is followed by full  删除换行 thickness skin graft. After that the joints around the  删除换行 contracture are properly splinted. If the contracture is  删除换行 released by Z-plasty, the limb is then splinted properly so  删除换行 that no further contracture is possible.\n\n【55】Postoperative care is mainly applying splints when the  删除换行 contracture is near a joint. In case of axilla, abduction  删除换行 splint is applied for 4 to 6 months, in case of elbow and  删除换行 knee, splints are applied with slight flexion of the joint  删除换行 for 4 to 6 months. In case of wrist, splint is applied  删除换行 keeping the wrist in slight extension position for 4  删除换行 months. In case of hand, it is kept in position of function  删除换行 with proper splint for 3 months. In case of fingers, these  删除换行 are kept in flexion in the position of function for 3  删除换行 months. In case of neck, a moulded cervical collar is  删除换行 applied for 6 months.\n\n【56】Physiotherapy is particularly important in the  删除换行 postoperative period in the limb contracture.\n\n【57】SOLAR KERATOSIS (SYN. SENILE\n\n【58】KERATOSIS)\n\n【59】Prolonged exposure to sunlight will cause  删除换行 hyperkeratosis of the skin, which is known as solar 删除换行 keratosis. This condition often takes malignant change. \n\n【60】POST BURN CONTRACTURE\n\n【61】(i) The patients are usually above middle age. \n\n【62】They have usually worked out of doors for many years. \n\n【63】Majority are fair-skinned individuals.\n\n【64】(ii) Patient notices appearance of thickened patches  删除换行 of the skin. These may occur in multiple.\n\n【65】(iii) These are usually seen on the face, back and  删除换行 on the hands.\n\n【66】HISTORY.—\n\n【67】The thickened patches are yellowish-grey or sometimes  删除换行 brown in colour. Usually the lesions are less than 1 cm  删除换行 in diameter. They have a dry hard scale on the surface  删除换行 of the lesion.\n\n【68】It is a hard lesion which is firmly adherent to the 删除换行 skin.\n\n【69】Careful watch must be kept to note if the lesion is  删除换行 undergoing malignant change or not. If the patch or nodule  删除换行 is tethered to the underlying structures, it is turning to  删除换行 malignancy. This condition is potentially malignant. It may  删除换行 take about 10 years to become malignant. It usually  删除换行 becomes squamous cell carcinoma, which is of slow  删除换行 growing nature with little tendency to metastasise.\n\n【70】Lymph nodes are never palpable in solar keratosis as  删除换行 such. If regional lymph nodes are palpable, it is sure that  删除换行 the lesion has turned malignant.\n\n【71】TREATMENT.— Avoidance of sunlight is particularly  删除换行 important prophylactically and may cause improvement of  删除换行 this condition. Best treatment is removal by freezing with  删除换行 carbondioxide or liquid nitrogen. The lesion may be  删除换行 destroyed by curettage and cautery, though it may leave  删除换行 scarring. Thick lesions should be surgically excised. Lesion  删除换行 in the face may particularly be treated by 5-fluorouracil  删除换行 cream.\n\n【72】KAPOSI’S SARCOMA\n\n【73】In this condition multiple red-purple plaques and  删除换行 nodules appear on the legs. It is a rare condition of  删除换行 cutaneous sarcoma. It is a slow growing malignant  删除换行 mesenchymal tumour.\n\n【74】PATHOLOGY.— The main histologic features of \n\n【75】Kaposi's sarcoma are proliferation of groups of spindle删除8：<u>￾</u>shaped, somewhat pleomorphic cells, having prominent  删除换行 dark nuclei; proliferation of small vessels lined with  删除换行 endothelial cells having large hyperchromatic nuclei and  删除换行 presence of red blood cells in slit-like spaces not lined  删除换行 by endothelial cells. Inflammatory cells including  删除换行 lymphocytes, plasma cells and large mononuclear cells  删除换行 are often present alongwith haemosiderin-laden  删除换行 macrophages.SKIN AND SUBCUTANEOUS TISSUE 35\n\n【76】CLINICAL FEATURES.— This condition is mainly  删除换行 seen in the middle age or above (40 to 70 years). \n\n【77】Males are predominantly involved (male to female ratio  删除换行 is 10 : 1). It is quite rare in most parts of the world  删除换行 accounting for only 0.01% to 0.02% of all malignant  删除换行 tumours. However this is more common in Italy, Eastern \n\n【78】Europe and in certain parts of Africa. Initially, lesions  删除换行 of Kaposi's sarcoma appear as multiple or very rarely  删除换行 single, red papules in the skin of the lower legs. It  删除换行 commonly involves the feet, occasionally the hands, ear  删除换行 or nose. This can however occur anywhere in the skin. \n\n【79】This is a painless lesion. In course of time these lesions  删除换行 enlarge and coalesce forming purple-red spongy nodules  删除换行 as big as 7 cm or more. Pressure may produce  删除换行 blanching to reveal a brown tinge. These become  删除换行 ulcerated in the long run and infected. Signs of systemic  删除换行 lymphosarcoma, enlarged lymph nodes and  删除换行 hepatosplenomegaly are the characteristic features of these  删除换行 conditions. Internal organs like intestine may also be  删除换行 involved. Haemorrhage from intestinal lesion is a  删除换行 common complication. Occasionally, particularly in \n\n【80】African countries, children may be affected when the  删除换行 lymph node involvement precedes cutaneous and visceral  删除换行 lesions. Cervical lymph nodes and salivary glands are  删除换行 usually first involved and it is an aggressive condition. \n\n【81】This tumour has been associated with haemolytic  删除换行 anaemia, lymphoma, diabetes mellitus and  删除换行 immunosuppression (HIV infection or AIDS).\n\n【82】TREATMENT.— Treatment for small lesion is  删除换行 surgical excision. As these tumours are radiosensitive,  删除换行 radiotherapy may be used. In case of larger lesions  删除换行 radiotherapy may be used with chemotherapy.\n\n【83】BOWEN'S DISEASE\n\n【84】The main interest of this disease is that it is  删除换行 precancerous. It usually presents as a progressive flat \n\n【85】(non-elevated), pink scaly papular patches which are  删除换行 covered with crust. When the crust is removed the  删除换行 papules can be seen oozy with bloody surface. This  删除换行 condition is often wrongly considered as eczema by the  删除换行 patients. It is a rare condition. It occurs equally on  删除换行 the exposed and covered areas.\n\n【86】PATHOLOGY.— Histologically in this condition  删除换行 there is proliferation of atypical squamous cells  删除换行 throughout the whole thickness of the epidermis. Cells  删除换行 are prematurely keratinised. It often mimics Paget s  删除换行 disease of the breast. By the time this disease has  删除换行 been diagnosed, possibly Vith of the cases will have  删除换行 cancers elsewhere in the body either in the respiratory 删除换行 system or gastrointestinal tract or genitourinary system. \n\n【87】About Vz of the patients with Bowen's disease develop  删除换行 malignant cancer of the skin within 7 years.\n\n【88】CLINICAL FEATURES.-— The initial lesion is a  删除换行 small red scaly area which gradually enlarges. When the  删除换行 scale is removed it looks oozy and red. The lesion is  删除换行 usually flat and the margins are sharp. The lesion may  删除换行 occur anywhere in the body. Ulceration is a sign of  删除换行 malignancy. Biopsy is a must to establish diagnosis.\n\n【89】TREATMENT.— Initial lesion can be treated by  删除换行 cryotherapy or curettage and cauterisation. When the  删除换行 lesion has taken a definite shape, surgical excision is the  删除换行 best treatment if it is not too large. Radiotherapy may  删除换行 be applied for relatively bigger lesion. Chemotherapy with  删除换行 5-fluorouracil may be applied to small lesions.\n\n【90】EXAMINATIONS.—\nIn all wounds capillary loops at the base form the  删除换行 granulation tissue. If chronic infection stimulates the  删除换行 capillary loops to grow too vigorously a protruding mass  删除换行 develops covered with epithelium. This is a pyogenic 删除换行 granuloma. It is dull red, soft or firm and more or less  删除换行 pedunculated nodule which grows rapidly to about 2 cm  删除换行 in diameter. The patient usually complains of a rapidly 删除换行 growing swelling on the skin which bleeds easily and  删除换行 discharges serous or purulent fluid. The growth is so  删除换行 rapid that it attains about double the size in a few  删除换行 days.\n\n【91】Pyogenic granuloma can occur anywhere in the skin  删除换行 but is most commonly seen on the face, the fingers and  删除换行 the toes, the parts which are likely to be injured. \n\n【92】Although they are not typically painful, they are slightly  删除换行 tender. These are usually soft and are slightly  删除换行 compressible. The lump bleeds easily when touched. \n\n【93】Regional lymph nodes may be enlarged when such lesion  删除换行 is highly infected.\n\n【94】TREATMENT is excision.CHAPTER\n\n【95】ULCER, SINUS AND FISTULA \n\n【96】(INCLUDING PILONIDAL SINUS)删除5：<u> 2</u>\nPYOGENIC GRANULOMA\n\n【97】An ulcer is a break in the continuity of the covering  删除换行 epithelium — skin or mucous membrane.

The  删除换行 hypertrophic scar never gets worse after 6 months, but  删除换行 a true keloid continues to get worse even after 1 year. \n\n【3】It is characterised by proliferation of immature  删除换行 fibroblasts and also immature blood vessels. A keloid  删除换行 has claw-like processes. It looks smooth, pink and raised  删除换行 patch. A keloid is unsightly, often tender to touch andSKIN AND SUBCUTANEOUS TISSUE 33 删除换行 always itch.

It occurs equally on  删除换行 the exposed and covered areas.\n\n【86】PATHOLOGY.— Histologically in this condition  删除换行 there is proliferation of atypical squamous cells  删除换行 throughout the whole thickness of the epidermis. Cells  删除换行 are prematurely keratinised. It often mimics Paget s  删除换行 disease of the breast. By the time this disease has  删除换行 been diagnosed, possibly Vith of the cases will have  删除换行 cancers elsewhere in the body either in the respiratory 删除换行 system or gastrointestinal tract or genitourinary system. \n\n【87】About Vz of the patients with Bowen's disease develop  删除换行 malignant cancer of the skin within 7 years.\n\n【88】CLINICAL FEATURES.-— The initial lesion is a  删除换行 small red scaly area which gradually enlarges. When the  删除换行 scale is removed it looks oozy and red. The lesion is  删除换行 usually flat and the margins are sharp. The lesion may  删除换行 occur anywhere in the body. Ulceration is a sign of  删除换行 malignancy. Biopsy is a must to establish diagnosis.\n\n【89】TREATMENT.— Initial lesion can be treated by  删除换行 cryotherapy or curettage and cauterisation. When the  删除换行 lesion has taken a definite shape, surgical excision is the  删除换行 best treatment if it is not too large. Radiotherapy may  删除换行 be applied for relatively bigger lesion. Chemotherapy with  删除换行 5-fluorouracil may be applied to small lesions.\n\n【90】EXAMINATIONS.—\nIn all wounds capillary loops at the base form the  删除换行 granulation tissue. If chronic infection stimulates the  删除换行 capillary loops to grow too vigorously a protruding mass  删除换行 develops covered with epithelium. This is a pyogenic 删除换行 granuloma. It is dull red, soft or firm and more or less  删除换行 pedunculated nodule which grows rapidly to about 2 cm  删除换行 in diameter. The patient usually complains of a rapidly 删除换行 growing swelling on the skin which bleeds easily and  删除换行 discharges serous or purulent fluid. The growth is so  删除换行 rapid that it attains about double the size in a few  删除换行 days.\n\n【91】Pyogenic granuloma can occur anywhere in the skin  删除换行 but is most commonly seen on the face, the fingers and  删除换行 the toes, the parts which are likely to be injured. \n\n【92】Although they are not typically painful, they are slightly  删除换行 tender. These are usually soft and are slightly  删除换行 compressible. The lump bleeds easily when touched. \n\n【93】Regional lymph nodes may be enlarged when such lesion  删除换行 is highly infected.\n\n【94】TREATMENT is excision.CHAPTER\n\n【95】ULCER, SINUS AND FISTULA \n\n【96】(INCLUDING PILONIDAL SINUS)删除5：<u> 2</u>\nPYOGENIC GRANULOMA\n\n【97】An ulcer is a break in the continuity of the covering  删除换行 epithelium — skin or mucous membrane. It may either  删除换行 follow molecular death of the surface epithelium or its  删除换行 traumatic removal.\n\n【98】For clinical examinations and special investigations  删除换行 of ulcer the students are referred to author’s “A Manual  删除换行 on Clinical Surgery”.", "index": 5359, "show": true, "start": 5346, "end": 5420, "province": ["格式规范性", "多余换行"], "isEdit": false, "comment": "与上面【43】联接"}, {"text": ".\n\n【57】SOLAR KERATOSIS (SYN. SENILE\n\n【58】KERATOSIS)", "content": "【0】MISCELLANEOUS LESIONS\n\n【1】HYPERTROPHIC SCAR\n\n【2】The main distinguishing feature between a keloid  删除换行 and a hypertrophic scar is that in keloid the normal 删除换行 surrounding tissue is affected by spread. The  删除换行 hypertrophic scar never gets worse after 6 months, but  删除换行 a true keloid continues to get worse even after 1 year. \n\n【3】It is characterised by proliferation of immature  删除换行 fibroblasts and also immature blood vessels. A keloid  删除换行 has claw-like processes. It looks smooth, pink and raised  删除换行 patch. A keloid is unsightly, often tender to touch andSKIN AND SUBCUTANEOUS TISSUE 33 删除换行 always itch. The most charac-teristic feature of keloid  删除换行 is that it recurs even when it is excised.\n\n【4】AETIOLOGY.— There are a few aetiological 删除换行 factors which may cause  删除换行 keloid. These are :\n\n【5】1. Coloured races  删除换行 are particularly liable to  删除换行 keloid formation. Negroes  删除换行 are commonly affected.\n\n【6】2. It is a familial  删除换行 condition.\n\n【7】3. It is more  删除换行 common in women.\n\n【8】4. Tuberculosis plays  删除换行 a role in aetiology. \n\n【9】Patients with tuberculosis  删除换行 often suffer from keloid  删除换行 formation.\n\n<mark>【10】5. Local factors e.g. if the incision crosses the\n\n【11】Langer’s lines keloid formation is more common.\n\n</mark>\n【12】6. Dislocation of hair follicles is also a factor which  删除换行 is more often seen in burns.\n\n【13】PATHOLOGY.— The basic pathology of keloid is  删除换行 proliferation of immature fibroblasts and immature blood  删除换行 vessels around the base of the sebaceous and sweat glands. \n\n【14】These cells gradually infiltrate into the surrounding tissues  删除换行 and proliferation continues. Due to the claw-like  删除换行 encroachment into the surrounding tissues with  删除换行 proliferation of cells this condition is called keloid. \n\n【15】Presence of plenty of immature blood vessels causes  删除换行 pinkish colour of keloid with itching and blanching.\n\n【16】CLINICAL FEATURES.— Keloid may occur  删除换行 following incisional scar, burns or simple pin-prick or  删除换行 following resolution of an abscess or of a boil or even  删除换行 in the ear lobe after piercing. It is more common in \n\n【17】Afro-Carribean individuals. It is a raised swelling from  删除换行 the surface. It extends beyond the original scar in all  删除换行 directions with claw-like processes. This encroachment  删除换行 continues even after 1 year of the scar. It is slight  删除换行 pinkish in colour due to presence of capillaries. Patient  删除换行 often complains of itching and as she itches,  删除换行 serosanguineous fluid may ooze out. It is slightly warm  删除换行 and often slightly tender to touch.\n\n【18】KELOID\n\n【19】1. Recurrence of this condition.\n\n【20】2. Ulceration.\n\n【21】3. There may be very occasionally malignant change  删除换行 seen at the margin (Marjolin's ulcer), which has been  删除换行 denied by many surgeons.\n\n【22】4. Infection.\n\n【23】COM PLICA TIONS.—\n\n【24】I. According to the mode of origin —\n\n【25】(i) Acquired variety;\n\n【26】(ii) Spontaneous variety, which is quite rare. \n\n【27】Patient fails to give any history of previous injury. This  删除换行 is common in Negroes and Afro-Carribeans. Butterfly  删除换行 keloid in the region of the chest is sometimes  删除换行 spontaneous.\n\n【28】II. According to the growth of keloid —\n\n【29】(a) Progressive — when the keloid progresses with  删除换行 claw-like processes for quite a long time. It is pink,  删除换行 slightly tender, itching and oozing.\n\n【30】(b) Non-progressive -— when the keloid stops  删除换行 progressing after 6 months or so into the surrounding  删除换行 tissues, it is called non-progressive variety.\n\n【31】TREATMENT.— Treatment is extremely difficult.\n\n【32】Conservative treatment.—\n\n【33】1. Intrakeloidal injection of steroid is helpful and  删除换行 should be considered as the best treatment. Injection \n\n【34】Kenacort seems to be quite good in this regard.\n\n【35】2. Intrakeloidal hialuronidase injection may be tried.\n\n【36】3. Intrakeloidal injection of Vitamin A has given  删除换行 some better result.\n\n【37】4. Intrakeloidal injection of Methotrexate has been  删除换行 used with some success.\n\n【38】5. Deep X-ray therapy has also debatable success. It  删除换行 suppresses further proliferation of immature fibroblasts and  删除换行 blood vessels. So it may stop further growth of the  删除换行 keloid and stop itching.\n\n【39】6. Ultrasonic therapy has recently been tried with  删除换行 some success.\n\n【40】Surgery.—\n\n【41】1. Excision and resuturing is often followed by  删除换行 recurrence. Preoperative radiotherapy and postoperative  删除换行 radiotherapy prevent recurrence rate but the total efficacy  删除换行 of such treatment is not very much encouraging.\n\n【42】2. Shaving away the excess scar tissue and then  删除换行 resurfacing the area by a thin skin graft, though  删除换行 advocated by a few surgeons to give encouraging results,  删除换行 yet such treatment has never produced good results by  删除换行 large. Care should be taken not to extend the incision  删除换行 into the normal tissue at any point.\n\n【43】TYPES.—\nIn case of deep burns involving full thickness of  删除换行 skin, epithelialisation is not possible and healing occurs  删除换行 by fibrosis. In these cases skin grafting is required  删除换行 immediately. If this resurfacing is not done, the burn  删除换行 heals by scarring. When such scarring matures,  删除换行 contracture occurs, which is known as post burn\n删除3：<u>Fig. 1.27.— Keloid in front of  删除换行 the chest.</u>\n\n【44】删除27：<u>334 A TEXTBOOK ON SURGICAL SHORT CASES</u>\n\n<mark>【45】contracture. It takes about 6 months to 1 year for  删除换行 maturation.\n\n</mark>【46】In some cases of superficial burn, when it is infected  删除换行 it causes sloughing of deeper tissues. This also heals by  删除换行 fibrosis leading to post burn contracture.\n\n【47】It causes great cosmetic problem. Anatomical  删除换行 movements of the joint are restricted, if such contracture  删除换行 occurs around joints. Whenever it occurs it limits  删除换行 movements of the area.\n\n【48】Prevention.—\n\n【49】Post burn contracture can be prevented by treating  删除换行 deep burns properly and in time. Any deep burn requires  删除换行 skin grafting as soon as the wound starts granulating. \n\n【50】This can be performed by split thickness skin grafting or  删除换行 by flap skin grafting. After skin grafting the affected area  删除换行 should be properly splinted. Physiotherapy should be  删除换行 advised to prevent graft contracture.\n\n【51】In case of superficial burn, care should be taken that  删除换行 the burned area is not infected by giving prophylactive  删除换行 antibiotics also keeping the area clean. If the burn is  删除换行 near a joint, it should be properly splinted to prevent  删除换行 development of contracture.\n\n【52】Treatment.—\n\n【53】Once the burn contracture has developed, treatment  删除换行 is operation and it should be done under general  删除换行 anaesthesia.\n\n【54】The principle of treatment is either to excise the  删除换行 contracture or to release the contracture by Z-plasty. If  删除换行 the contracture can be excised, it is followed by full  删除换行 thickness skin graft. After that the joints around the  删除换行 contracture are properly splinted. If the contracture is  删除换行 released by Z-plasty, the limb is then splinted properly so  删除换行 that no further contracture is possible.\n\n【55】Postoperative care is mainly applying splints when the  删除换行 contracture is near a joint. In case of axilla, abduction  删除换行 splint is applied for 4 to 6 months, in case of elbow and  删除换行 knee, splints are applied with slight flexion of the joint  删除换行 for 4 to 6 months. In case of wrist, splint is applied  删除换行 keeping the wrist in slight extension position for 4  删除换行 months. In case of hand, it is kept in position of function  删除换行 with proper splint for 3 months. In case of fingers, these  删除换行 are kept in flexion in the position of function for 3  删除换行 months. In case of neck, a moulded cervical collar is  删除换行 applied for 6 months.\n\n【56】Physiotherapy is particularly important in the  删除换行 postoperative period in the limb contracture.\n\n【57】SOLAR KERATOSIS (SYN. SENILE\n\n【58】KERATOSIS)\n\n【59】Prolonged exposure to sunlight will cause  删除换行 hyperkeratosis of the skin, which is known as solar 删除换行 keratosis. This condition often takes malignant change. \n\n【60】POST BURN CONTRACTURE\n\n【61】(i) The patients are usually above middle age. \n\n【62】They have usually worked out of doors for many years. \n\n【63】Majority are fair-skinned individuals.\n\n【64】(ii) Patient notices appearance of thickened patches  删除换行 of the skin. These may occur in multiple.\n\n【65】(iii) These are usually seen on the face, back and  删除换行 on the hands.\n\n【66】HISTORY.—\n\n【67】The thickened patches are yellowish-grey or sometimes  删除换行 brown in colour. Usually the lesions are less than 1 cm  删除换行 in diameter. They have a dry hard scale on the surface  删除换行 of the lesion.\n\n【68】It is a hard lesion which is firmly adherent to the 删除换行 skin.\n\n【69】Careful watch must be kept to note if the lesion is  删除换行 undergoing malignant change or not. If the patch or nodule  删除换行 is tethered to the underlying structures, it is turning to  删除换行 malignancy. This condition is potentially malignant. It may  删除换行 take about 10 years to become malignant. It usually  删除换行 becomes squamous cell carcinoma, which is of slow  删除换行 growing nature with little tendency to metastasise.\n\n【70】Lymph nodes are never palpable in solar keratosis as  删除换行 such. If regional lymph nodes are palpable, it is sure that  删除换行 the lesion has turned malignant.\n\n【71】TREATMENT.— Avoidance of sunlight is particularly  删除换行 important prophylactically and may cause improvement of  删除换行 this condition. Best treatment is removal by freezing with  删除换行 carbondioxide or liquid nitrogen. The lesion may be  删除换行 destroyed by curettage and cautery, though it may leave  删除换行 scarring. Thick lesions should be surgically excised. Lesion  删除换行 in the face may particularly be treated by 5-fluorouracil  删除换行 cream.\n\n【72】KAPOSI’S SARCOMA\n\n【73】In this condition multiple red-purple plaques and  删除换行 nodules appear on the legs. It is a rare condition of  删除换行 cutaneous sarcoma. It is a slow growing malignant  删除换行 mesenchymal tumour.\n\n【74】PATHOLOGY.— The main histologic features of \n\n【75】Kaposi's sarcoma are proliferation of groups of spindle删除8：<u>￾</u>shaped, somewhat pleomorphic cells, having prominent  删除换行 dark nuclei; proliferation of small vessels lined with  删除换行 endothelial cells having large hyperchromatic nuclei and  删除换行 presence of red blood cells in slit-like spaces not lined  删除换行 by endothelial cells. Inflammatory cells including  删除换行 lymphocytes, plasma cells and large mononuclear cells  删除换行 are often present alongwith haemosiderin-laden  删除换行 macrophages.SKIN AND SUBCUTANEOUS TISSUE 35\n\n【76】CLINICAL FEATURES.— This condition is mainly  删除换行 seen in the middle age or above (40 to 70 years). \n\n【77】Males are predominantly involved (male to female ratio  删除换行 is 10 : 1). It is quite rare in most parts of the world  删除换行 accounting for only 0.01% to 0.02% of all malignant  删除换行 tumours. However this is more common in Italy, Eastern \n\n【78】Europe and in certain parts of Africa. Initially, lesions  删除换行 of Kaposi's sarcoma appear as multiple or very rarely  删除换行 single, red papules in the skin of the lower legs. It  删除换行 commonly involves the feet, occasionally the hands, ear  删除换行 or nose. This can however occur anywhere in the skin. \n\n【79】This is a painless lesion. In course of time these lesions  删除换行 enlarge and coalesce forming purple-red spongy nodules  删除换行 as big as 7 cm or more. Pressure may produce  删除换行 blanching to reveal a brown tinge. These become  删除换行 ulcerated in the long run and infected. Signs of systemic  删除换行 lymphosarcoma, enlarged lymph nodes and  删除换行 hepatosplenomegaly are the characteristic features of these  删除换行 conditions. Internal organs like intestine may also be  删除换行 involved. Haemorrhage from intestinal lesion is a  删除换行 common complication. Occasionally, particularly in \n\n【80】African countries, children may be affected when the  删除换行 lymph node involvement precedes cutaneous and visceral  删除换行 lesions. Cervical lymph nodes and salivary glands are  删除换行 usually first involved and it is an aggressive condition. \n\n【81】This tumour has been associated with haemolytic  删除换行 anaemia, lymphoma, diabetes mellitus and  删除换行 immunosuppression (HIV infection or AIDS).\n\n【82】TREATMENT.— Treatment for small lesion is  删除换行 surgical excision. As these tumours are radiosensitive,  删除换行 radiotherapy may be used. In case of larger lesions  删除换行 radiotherapy may be used with chemotherapy.\n\n【83】BOWEN'S DISEASE\n\n【84】The main interest of this disease is that it is  删除换行 precancerous. It usually presents as a progressive flat \n\n【85】(non-elevated), pink scaly papular patches which are  删除换行 covered with crust. When the crust is removed the  删除换行 papules can be seen oozy with bloody surface. This  删除换行 condition is often wrongly considered as eczema by the  删除换行 patients. It is a rare condition. It occurs equally on  删除换行 the exposed and covered areas.\n\n【86】PATHOLOGY.— Histologically in this condition  删除换行 there is proliferation of atypical squamous cells  删除换行 throughout the whole thickness of the epidermis.

This is an example of referred pain. The patient feels pain in his arm， but there is in fact no pathology affecting his arm. Instead， there is pathology affecting his heart， which is innervated by nerves from the same spinal levels as those innervating the arm. The afferent pain signal actually originating from the heart is erroneously interpreted as coming from the arm， resulting in referred pain. Central pain arises from a lesion in the thalamus or cor-tex that is interpreted as pain in the body part corresponding to the lesion. Phantom pain is \"felt\"in amputated limbs， and radicular pain is pain distrib-uted over a spinal cord level， caused by compression of the corresponding nerve root.\n\n【15】20.2 C. Referred pain occurs when pain of visceral origin is localized to a part of the body far removed from the source. Inflammation of the pleura can fre-quently be referred to the thoracic dermatomes of the back.\n\n【16】20.3B. Morphine and other opioid pain medications decrease pain by modulating the response of the brain and spinal cord to painful stimuli. These molecules bind to receptor sites for endogenous opioids which are located in diffuse areas of the CNS， including in the brain and spinal cord. In the spinal cord， binding to opioid receptors modulates the response of second- and third-order neurons in the pain pathway to painful stimuli coming in from the periphery. Opioid receptors in the brainstem activate descending tracts that further modulate pain transmission in the spinal cord. Through poorly understood mechanisms， opiates also alter the perception of pain； in other words， the sensation of pain is still there， but it is not so debilitating.\n\n【17】NEUROSCIENCE PEARLS\n\n【18】删除17：<u>一</u>Three types of pain sensations occur after an acute noxious event： 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> fast pain， 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> slow pain， and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> visceral pain.\n\n【19】Fast pain is an accurately localizable， immediate， sharp sensation result-ing from activation of myelinated Ad fibers.\n\n【20】Slow pain is a vaguely localizable， burning pain resulting from activation of unmyelinated C fibers.\n\n【21】Visceral pain is an aching pain resulting from stimulation of deep somatic receptors in joints or muscles， which are innervated by both C and Ad 29 fibers.

Diagnostic mammography reveals a 2-cm mass with uneven borders and spiculated calcifications; this finding is suspicious for malignancy. A biopsy is performed. The report identifies ductal carcinoma in situ, and a lumpectomy is performed. The pathology report further states that the malignant tissue is positive for human epidermal growth factor 2/ neu receptor, but negative for estrogen and progesterone receptors. Which of the following therapies is specifically targeted to treat this patient’s breast cancer?\n\n【1】> (A) Bevacizumab\n\n【2】> (B) Cyclophosphamide\n\n【3】> (C) Doxorubicin\n\n【4】> (D) Tamoxifen\n\n【5】> (E) Trastuzumab\n\n【6】 Answer: The correct answer is E. Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody against human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) that can kill breast cancer cells over-expressing HER2. This patient’s breast cancer is positive for HER2/neu receptor, thus she is likely to have a positive response to the chemotherapeutic agent trastuzumab.  \n\n【7】Answer A is incorrect. Bevacizumab, like all drugs ending in “mab,” is a monoclonal antibody. This drug binds to vascular endothelial growth factor, a cytokine frequently produced by cancer cells to promote angiogenesis. It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2004 to treat metastatic colon cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. It also has been used off-label by ophthalmologists to slow the progression of macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy, diseases that occur through abnormal proliferation of blood vessels in the eye. It is not indicated for the treatment of breast cancer.  \n\n【8】Answer B is incorrect. Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent that cross-links DNA, leading to apoptosis. Cyclophosphamide is commonly used to treat non-Hodgkin lymphoma and breast/ovarian cancer, but is not specifically targeted to a HER2/neu receptor-positive tumor.  \n\n【9】Answer C is incorrect. Doxorubicin is an antitumor antibiotic commonly used to treat breast cancer. It acts by intercalation into DNA, inhibiting topoisomerase II and resulting in DNA damage and cell death. Doxorubicin is associated with congestive heart failure. Doxorubicin might be helpful for this patient, but is not specifically targeted to an HER2/neu receptor-positive tumor.  \n\n【10】Answer D is incorrect. Tamoxifen as a chemotherapeutic agent is useful only in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. It is a selective estrogen receptor modulator with estrogen receptor antagonist effects whose mechanism of action relies on binding, and thereby blocking, estrogen receptors to impede the production of estrogen-responsive genes. Tamoxifen is not useful in a breast cancer that is negative for estrogen receptor.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 13:54:54", "endTime": "2024/09/12 13:54:58", "cost": 4.144}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:29", "update_time": "2024-09-11 21:54:58", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 21:54:54"}

Over the last 6 months, her headaches have increased in intensity and frequency, leaving her experiencing intense, pounding, right-sided headaches associated with nausea and occasionally vomiting. During the headaches she is unable to tolerate head movement, bright light, or sounds of any sort. They typically last up to 8 hours. She tried over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory analgesics with some relief but only if the headaches are not severe at the onset. Her neurologic examination was normal as was the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her brain with and without contrast and basic laboratory tests. You diagnose her with chronic migraines and prescribe prophylactic medication. Over the next 3 months, you prescribe for the patient numerous migraine prophylaxis agents, including topiramate, propranolol, and amitriptyline. Despite adequate trials, these medications were not particularly effective. Finally, you prescribe divalproex sodium (Depakote) 750 mg by mouth twice daily, and this medication successfully reduced her migraine frequency to twice per month. You also prescribe a course of amoxicillin for the patient at that visit because you suspect she has an infection. At your next follow-up visit, the patient complains of fatigue and nausea, so you perform a pregnancy test. The results of that test are positive. The patient was surprised because she had been taking the same low-dose estrogen oral contraceptive pill daily for years without ever becoming pregnant. After she returned home, she spent hours on the Internet researching the teratogenicity of divalproex and the interaction between antibiotics and her oral contraceptive pill. Later that week, you receive an angry e-mail accusing you of malpractice. She promptly transferred her medical care to another physician.\n\n【3】 Is this a likely case of medical malpractice?\n\n【4】 What steps should you take now that you have received the patient’s e-mail?\n\n【5】### ANSWERS TO CASE 36:\n\n【6】#### Risk Management\n\n【7】Summary : A 30-year-old gravida 0 woman was started on divalproex sodium for migraine headache prophylaxis (a pregnancy category X for migraine headache prophylaxis but category D for seizures) and becomes unexpectedly pregnant despite taking oral contraception regularly. The pregnancy is the result of a drug interaction with an antibiotic that reduced the efficacy of the oral contraception she was taking. The patient is upset by both the unplanned pregnancy and the potential for iatrogenic fetal harm. You receive an e-mail from the patient accusing you of malpractice.\n\n【8】 Is this likely a case of medical malpractice? Yes.\n\n【9】 What steps should you take now that you have received the patient’s e-mail ? You must discuss the issue with your risk management team and consider an apology and disclosure of the medical error.\n\n【10】### ANALYSIS\n\n【11】##### Objectives\n\n【12】1\\. To understand the basic theory behind medical malpractice lawsuits.\n\n【13】2\\. To understand how the legal system understands the duties of physicians to their patients.\n\n【14】##### Considerations\n\n【15】In the present case, the physician prescribed a teratogenic medication to a woman of reproductive age and simultaneously prescribed an antibiotic known to cause decreased efficacy of oral contraceptives without recommending a backup form of contraception. This is an example of medical malpractice. All of the elements of a malpractice suit are present: The physician owed the patient a duty of care, the physician breached this duty, the patient was harmed, and the physician’s actions were the cause of the harm. This is also an example of medical error, and the physician should consider full disclosure to the patient with an apology.\n\n【16】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【17】#### Medical Malpractice\n\n【18】### DEFINITIONS\n\n【19】INFORMED CONSENT : A patient with decision-making capacity has the right to accept or refuse medical interventions. The informed consent process consists of several steps: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> the physician introduces the concept of the informed consent process as one of mutual decision making, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> the physician elicits the patient’s current understanding of her condition and alternatives for management, 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> the physician provides additional information about the patient’s condition and alternatives for management, including the option of doing nothing 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> the physician assists the patient in understanding the material presented, 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> the patient articulates her decision to the physician, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u> after further discussion and agreement, the management decision is carried out by the physician.\n\n【20】MEDICAL MALPRACTICE : The negligent or improper provision of medical care by a licensed health care professional.\n\n【21】MEDICAL NEGLIGENCE : A plaintiff must prove the following four elements to prevail in a medical negligence lawsuit: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> the physician owed the plaintiff a duty of care, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> the physician breeched that duty (deviated from the standard of care), 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> the plaintiff suffered an injury, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> the physician’s actions were the proximate cause of the plaintiff’s injury.\n\n【22】PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE : The evidentiary standard in medical negligence cases requires that the plaintiff prove the facts by a preponderance of the evidence. This requires demonstrating to the jury that the facts the plaintiff alleges were more likely than not to have occurred.\n\n【23】PROXIMATE CAUSE : But for the physician’s action, the plaintiff would not have suffered harm. The proximate cause does not have to be the immediate cause, but the physician’s allegedly negligent actions must have set up a series of events that led to the harm.\n\n【24】STANDARD OF CARE : Based on expert testimony, a jury is asked to determine what a reasonably prudent medical specialist in the same specialty as the defendant physician would have done in the same circumstances as the defendant physician. Typically, the standard of care is based on a national, not a local, standard.\n\n【25】### CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【26】##### Malpractice Basics\n\n【27】When filing a malpractice lawsuit in civil court, the patient alleges that the treating physician cared for the plaintiff in a manner that deviated from nationally accepted norms and resulted in injury. To win a medical malpractice claim, the plaintiff must demonstrate each of the 4 elements of a negligence claim. The elements are as follows:\n\n【28】1\\. The plaintiff must show that a physician-patient relationship existed, thus creating a duty of care. The physician–patient relationship inherently imposes this duty.\n\n【29】2\\. The plaintiff must prove that the physician’s actions were negligent, in that they deviated from nationally accepted professional standards, by proffering expert testimony that a reasonably prudent physician would have acted differently under the same circumstances.\n\n【30】3\\. The plaintiff must demonstrate that he or she suffered physical, emotional, and/or financial injury.\n\n【31】4\\. The plaintiff must establish that the physician’s action was the proximate cause of the injury.\n\n【32】Unlike the more familiar “beyond a reasonable doubt” standard of criminal cases, in a medical malpractice case, the plaintiff must prove the 4 elements “by the preponderance of the evidence” (51% certainty), a much more lenient evidentiary standard.\n\n【33】### ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION\n\n【34】A variety of actions, if found to deviate from the standard of care, may form the basis of a negligence lawsuit. Negligent actions may reflect poor quality medical care including misdiagnosis, mismanagement of a disease process, or an improperly performed procedure. Allegations of negligence may also arise from unprofessional behavior. In addition, negligence may arise from a physician’s failure to obtain adequate informed consent for a treatment. Under this theory of negligence, the plaintiff claims that the physician did not provide either the patient or the patient’s surrogate enough information about the risks and benefits of a treatment to make an informed decision about whether to accept or reject a proposed intervention. <sup><a></a><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【35】In this case, the patient may have 2 theories of negligence on which to base a malpractice lawsuit: inadequate informed consent and poor quality medical care. Valproate-containing medications present a particularly heightened risk of adverse effects to the developing fetus. If the fetus experiences an adverse outcome, then the physician’s liability exposure will depend, in part, on how thoroughly the physician discussed with the patient the risks and benefits of taking divalproex sodium, which is a known teratogen. Ideally, the physician discussed the teratogenic potential of the medication at the time the medication was offered and documented this discussion in the medical record. A woman of childbearing potential may reasonably expect to be informed about the heightened potential fetal harm should she become pregnant while taking a particularly potent teratogen. Thus, a physician who does not know enough to discuss the risks and benefits of a therapy or forgets to do so is providing poor medical care and inadequate informed consent.\n\n【36】Another complication of this case is that the patient became pregnant around the time that the physician prescribed her an antibiotic known to reduce the efficacy of her oral contraceptive medication. The physician’s liability exposure depends on whether and how the patient was counseled about the drug–drug interaction. The physician may have missed the fact that the patient was taking an oral contraceptive pill. Alternatively, the physician may not have been aware of the drug–drug interaction and thus did not know to counsel the patient to take extra contraceptive precautions during the time of antibiotic use. These errors in either procedure (medicine reconciliation) or knowledge (ignorance of drug–drug interactions) may also form the basis of a malpractice lawsuit for negligence.\n\n【37】This case also raises the question of apologies for medical errors. Although a thorough review of the topic of apologies for medical error is beyond the scope of this case, physicians should be aware that states approach the admissibility of apologies during a medical malpractice lawsuit differently. Ethically, physicians are expected to offer some type of apology for a medical error. The current legal protections for physicians are inadequate in most states to facilitate free communication with patients and families after a medical error has been committed. Although some states have no law in this area, the majority of states have apology laws. Apology laws typically protect only the actual expression of sympathy but not the expression of fault that may accompany the expression of sympathy. A minority of states has disclosure laws. These laws mandate disclosure of certain unanticipated outcomes and may protect the communication from being used against the physician in a legal or administrative action. Knowing the law and working with local risk management personnel is advisable in these difficult situations when a medical error has been made.\n\n【38】###", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 14:01:09", "endTime": "2024/09/12 14:01:31", "cost": 21.604}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:29", "update_time": "2024-09-11 22:01:31", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 22:01:09"}

It is important to control the habit after 2 years of age. In some patients, the help of a psychologist is valuable.\n\n【14】Digital sucking is responsible for causing significant changes in the maxilla and in the mandible during the growth period.\n\n【15】In general, the maxilla becomes narrow and V shaped, the mandible tends to be retrognathic, and, as a consequence, a significant open bite is developed with proclined upper incisors and retruded lower incisors.\n\n【16】Due to the excessive proclination of the upper incisors, lips become incompetent and the tongue is placed between the upper and lower incisors during the swallowing process, worsening it.\n\n【17】Also, there is a significant link between the respiration mode, the direction of the facial growth, and the development of the malocclusions (posterior cross bite and anterior open bite), due to abnormal contraction of the cheek muscles.\n\n【18】Hypertrophic lymphoid tissues and nasal obstruction in combination with large adenoids and tonsils are the most common cause of nasal obstruction and mouth breathing as they push the tongue forward due to pain and decrease in the amount of posterior space for the tongue.\n\n【19】This atypical swallowing pattern and the anterior posture of the tongue at rest prevent the eruption of the incisors and increase the anterior open bite with lower lip interposition every time the patient swallows.\n\n【20】In general, these young patients are sent to the speech therapist in order to improve the pronunciation of certain words, but it is important to remember that the anterior open bite is the consequence, not the cause.\n\n【21】Also, orofacial and speech dysfunction could be combined with problems at the TMJ that could worsen in the future.\n\n【22】In addition to TMJ problems, episodes of sleep apnea could be added. The child could stop breathing several times during the night (20–40 times per hour of sleep). As a consequence, he or she would feel daytime sleepiness, headaches, fatigue, obesity, changes in personality, lack of attention at school in the morning, etc.\n\n【23】Since sleep apnea is a progressive disorder, the consultation with the specialist is very important from the first day in order to perform a multi- and interdisciplinary treatment plan and avoid relapse (Pascually et al.).\n\n【24】It is important to remember that sleepwalking in young children and enuresis are commonly related to open bite problems.\n\n【25】The real question is who, when, why, and how to treat.\n\n【26】The higher the percentage of environmental factors in relation to the genetic ones, the better the prognosis. Among the deleterious habits, the prolonged use of pacifiers, mouth breathing, or thumb-sucking are determinants. In some patients, the help of a psychologist is fundamental to control the habits.\n\n【27】Unfortunately, there isn’t only one type of appliance to treat all these patients. The appliance selection has to be related to the etiology, age of the patient, seriousness of the problem, etc. The orthodontist is responsible for the appropriate selection.\n\n【28】The decision of whether to use a removable, fixed appliance or a combination of both is related to the etiology and the skeletal maturity in order to maximize the effectiveness of the orthodontic treatment.\n\n【29】The normalization of the vertical dimension is extremely challenging for the orthodontist to control, especially in high-angle patients with mouth breathing.\n\n【30】If problems leading to an open bite could be identified and treated early, it might be possible to minimize or even eliminate an undesirable pattern of growth.\n\n【31】According to the structures affected, anterior open bite can be divided into three main categories: dental, dentoalveolar, and skeletal.\n\n【32】Dental and dentoalveolar open bites develop as a result of prolonged mechanical blockage of the normal vertical development of anterior teeth and alveolar process 删除10：<u>(Torres et al. 2012 )</u>.\n\n【33】The skeletal form, in turn, is characterized by a significant vertical skeletal discrepancy, with features such as counterclockwise rotation of the palatine process, increased lower anterior facial height and gonial angle, short mandibular ramus, and increased posterior dentoalveolar height in both mandible and maxilla.\n\n【34】3.1 Diagnosis\n-------------\n\n【35】   Medical and dental analysis\n\n【36】   Patients’ chief complaint\n\n【37】   Evaluation of growth\n\n【38】   Functional analysis\n\n【39】   Photographic and radiologic evaluation\n\n【40】   Vertical facial pattern\n\n【41】   Unfavorable growth pattern\n\n【42】The treatment goals should include the removal of the etiological and environmental factors to permit the normalization of the anterior growth development.\n\n【43】Until now, no consensus has been reached to determine the best time to initiate the orthopedic/orthodontic treatment. Nonetheless, it is totally accepted that the earlier the correction of the open bite begins, the better the results will be. Also, early treatment helps avoid relapse.\n\n【44】Myofunctional therapy is the best option to normalize mouth breathing.\n\n【45】Control and reduction of the extrusion of the molars are fundamental to allow a counterclockwise rotation of the mandible to maintain the results.\n\n【46】Failure to control bad habits may be the most important reason of relapse.\n\n【47】The role of the otolaryngologist to improve and normalize nasal breathing during the diagnosis process and speech pathology is of prime importance.\n\n【48】In general, anterior open bite in temporary or early mixed dentition is associated with digital sucking habit and tongue anterior interposition.\n\n【49】Its correction is very important since otherwise the problem could worsen and turn into a skeletal alteration.\n\n【50】The size and length of the lips are also important to maintain a proper lip seal during day and night. Also, it is necessary to normalize the position and function of the tongue.\n\n【51】Normally, children who breathe through their mouth have a narrow maxillary arch, protrusive incisors, Class II occlusion, convex facial profile, bags under the eyes, an open mouth posture, and narrow nostrils.\n\n【52】The importance of the multidisciplinary treatment cannot be denied.\n\n【53】Treatment strategies are in close relationship with etiology, facial biotype, age of the patient, and clinical experiences.\n\n【54】The management of the tongue thrust and mouth breathing involves the interception of the habit. First of all, the doctor has to determine that the patient can use his/her nose to breathe normally.\n\n【55】It is important to remember that mouth breathing is abnormal and can affect the whole stomatognathic system, body posture, etc. and not only the position of the teeth.\n\n【56】As soon as this problem is corrected, fewer consequences appear.\n\n【57】Different appliances could be used according to the age of the patient and his/her medical history, in order to establish a new neuromuscular pattern.\n\n【58】According to the etiology and the importance of the problem, removable, fixed, or a combination of both types of appliances can be used.\n\n【59】The orthodontist has the final decision.\n\n【60】The following examples will describe each option in detail.\n\n【61】This 6-year, 8-month-old patient is sent to the office by her family dentist in search of a second opinion regarding her anterior open bite.\n\n【62】An adenoidectomy was performed 4 months earlier.

Only the central upper and lower incisors were erupting at that time .\n删除3：<u>Fig. 3.2\n\n【67】( a , b ) A significant convex profile along with a significant anterior open bite was present\n</u>\nNo posterior cross bite was present. All day and night, the tongue was placed between the upper and lower incisors which were why they could not erupt normally. Due to the presence of large cavities, some stainless steel crowns were placed on the temporary molars .\n删除3：<u>Fig. 3.3\n\n【68】( a , b ) Pretreatment right and left side.

It is fabricated with a special type of polyurethane and helps the correction and normalization of the muscular dysfunction.\n\n【70】The appliance is especially designed to stimulate anterior and lateral muscles and help to achieve normal nasal breathing. Since the material is soft, no major problems of adaptation are present .\n删除3：<u>Fig. 3.4\n\n【71】( a , b ) In order to achieve nasal breathing, a pre-orthodontic trainer was recommended.

A 6-month follow-up was highly recommended .\n删除3：<u>Fig. 3.9\n\n【78】( a , b ) Follow-up 18 months later\n</u>\nIt is advisable that open bites be treated as early as possible and in this way reinstate normal oral and breathing functions to reduce the possibility of relapse.\n\n【79】The type of trainer (T4K) is a valid alternative to treat these open bite patients at an early age. It also helps to improve dental arch development during the early and late mixed dentition, and most importantly, this appliance helps normalize bad habits.\n\n【80】Also, other types of functional appliances can be used according to the orthodontist’s preferences. As always, correct diagnosis is more important than the type of the appliance used.\n\n【81】The comparison between the pre- and posttreatment front dental photographs showed evidence of the normalization of the anterior open bite and the parallelism between the occlusal and gingival planes.\n\n【82】No brackets were required to achieve the expected results.\n\n【83】Ideally an overcorrection of the overjet and overbite is highly recommended .\n\n【84】A 6-month control was recommended until all the second molars erupted.\n删除3：<u>Fig. 3.10\n\n【85】( a , b ) The comparison between the pre- and posttreatment front dental photographs showed normalization of the anterior open bite\n</u>\nUpon analyzing the lower third of the face and the nasolabial angle, a significant improvement was confirmed.

It is important to control the habit after 2 years of age. In some patients, the help of a psychologist is valuable.\n\n【14】Digital sucking is responsible for causing significant changes in the maxilla and in the mandible during the growth period.\n\n【15】In general, the maxilla becomes narrow and V shaped, the mandible tends to be retrognathic, and, as a consequence, a significant open bite is developed with proclined upper incisors and retruded lower incisors.\n\n【16】Due to the excessive proclination of the upper incisors, lips become incompetent and the tongue is placed between the upper and lower incisors during the swallowing process, worsening it.\n\n【17】Also, there is a significant link between the respiration mode, the direction of the facial growth, and the development of the malocclusions (posterior cross bite and anterior open bite), due to abnormal contraction of the cheek muscles.\n\n【18】Hypertrophic lymphoid tissues and nasal obstruction in combination with large adenoids and tonsils are the most common cause of nasal obstruction and mouth breathing as they push the tongue forward due to pain and decrease in the amount of posterior space for the tongue.\n\n【19】This atypical swallowing pattern and the anterior posture of the tongue at rest prevent the eruption of the incisors and increase the anterior open bite with lower lip interposition every time the patient swallows.\n\n【20】In general, these young patients are sent to the speech therapist in order to improve the pronunciation of certain words, but it is important to remember that the anterior open bite is the consequence, not the cause.\n\n【21】Also, orofacial and speech dysfunction could be combined with problems at the TMJ that could worsen in the future.\n\n【22】In addition to TMJ problems, episodes of sleep apnea could be added. The child could stop breathing several times during the night (20–40 times per hour of sleep). As a consequence, he or she would feel daytime sleepiness, headaches, fatigue, obesity, changes in personality, lack of attention at school in the morning, etc.\n\n【23】Since sleep apnea is a progressive disorder, the consultation with the specialist is very important from the first day in order to perform a multi- and interdisciplinary treatment plan and avoid relapse (Pascually et al.).\n\n【24】It is important to remember that sleepwalking in young children and enuresis are commonly related to open bite problems.\n\n【25】The real question is who, when, why, and how to treat.\n\n【26】The higher the percentage of environmental factors in relation to the genetic ones, the better the prognosis. Among the deleterious habits, the prolonged use of pacifiers, mouth breathing, or thumb-sucking are determinants. In some patients, the help of a psychologist is fundamental to control the habits.\n\n【27】Unfortunately, there isn’t only one type of appliance to treat all these patients. The appliance selection has to be related to the etiology, age of the patient, seriousness of the problem, etc. The orthodontist is responsible for the appropriate selection.\n\n【28】The decision of whether to use a removable, fixed appliance or a combination of both is related to the etiology and the skeletal maturity in order to maximize the effectiveness of the orthodontic treatment.\n\n【29】The normalization of the vertical dimension is extremely challenging for the orthodontist to control, especially in high-angle patients with mouth breathing.\n\n【30】If problems leading to an open bite could be identified and treated early, it might be possible to minimize or even eliminate an undesirable pattern of growth.\n\n【31】According to the structures affected, anterior open bite can be divided into three main categories: dental, dentoalveolar, and skeletal.\n\n【32】Dental and dentoalveolar open bites develop as a result of prolonged mechanical blockage of the normal vertical development of anterior teeth and alveolar process 删除10：<u>(Torres et al. 2012 )</u>.\n\n【33】The skeletal form, in turn, is characterized by a significant vertical skeletal discrepancy, with features such as counterclockwise rotation of the palatine process, increased lower anterior facial height and gonial angle, short mandibular ramus, and increased posterior dentoalveolar height in both mandible and maxilla.\n\n【34】3.1 Diagnosis\n-------------\n\n【35】   Medical and dental analysis\n\n【36】   Patients’ chief complaint\n\n【37】   Evaluation of growth\n\n【38】   Functional analysis\n\n【39】   Photographic and radiologic evaluation\n\n【40】   Vertical facial pattern\n\n【41】   Unfavorable growth pattern\n\n【42】The treatment goals should include the removal of the etiological and environmental factors to permit the normalization of the anterior growth development.\n\n【43】Until now, no consensus has been reached to determine the best time to initiate the orthopedic/orthodontic treatment. Nonetheless, it is totally accepted that the earlier the correction of the open bite begins, the better the results will be. Also, early treatment helps avoid relapse.\n\n【44】Myofunctional therapy is the best option to normalize mouth breathing.\n\n【45】Control and reduction of the extrusion of the molars are fundamental to allow a counterclockwise rotation of the mandible to maintain the results.\n\n【46】Failure to control bad habits may be the most important reason of relapse.\n\n【47】The role of the otolaryngologist to improve and normalize nasal breathing during the diagnosis process and speech pathology is of prime importance.\n\n【48】In general, anterior open bite in temporary or early mixed dentition is associated with digital sucking habit and tongue anterior interposition.\n\n【49】Its correction is very important since otherwise the problem could worsen and turn into a skeletal alteration.\n\n【50】The size and length of the lips are also important to maintain a proper lip seal during day and night. Also, it is necessary to normalize the position and function of the tongue.\n\n【51】Normally, children who breathe through their mouth have a narrow maxillary arch, protrusive incisors, Class II occlusion, convex facial profile, bags under the eyes, an open mouth posture, and narrow nostrils.\n\n【52】The importance of the multidisciplinary treatment cannot be denied.\n\n【53】Treatment strategies are in close relationship with etiology, facial biotype, age of the patient, and clinical experiences.\n\n【54】The management of the tongue thrust and mouth breathing involves the interception of the habit. First of all, the doctor has to determine that the patient can use his/her nose to breathe normally.\n\n【55】It is important to remember that mouth breathing is abnormal and can affect the whole stomatognathic system, body posture, etc. and not only the position of the teeth.\n\n【56】As soon as this problem is corrected, fewer consequences appear.\n\n【57】Different appliances could be used according to the age of the patient and his/her medical history, in order to establish a new neuromuscular pattern.\n\n【58】According to the etiology and the importance of the problem, removable, fixed, or a combination of both types of appliances can be used.\n\n【59】The orthodontist has the final decision.\n\n【60】The following examples will describe each option in detail.\n\n【61】This 6-year, 8-month-old patient is sent to the office by her family dentist in search of a second opinion regarding her anterior open bite.\n\n【62】An adenoidectomy was performed 4 months earlier.

Of all the possible choices, a prefabricated functional appliance also known as Trainer System TM (Myofunctional Research Co. Australia) was chosen. It is fabricated with a special type of polyurethane and helps the correction and normalization of the muscular dysfunction.\n\n【70】The appliance is especially designed to stimulate anterior and lateral muscles and help to achieve normal nasal breathing. Since the material is soft, no major problems of adaptation are present .\n删除3：<u>Fig. 3.4\n\n【71】( a , b ) In order to achieve nasal breathing, a pre-orthodontic trainer was recommended.

It is important to control the habit after 2 years of age. In some patients, the help of a psychologist is valuable.\n\n【14】Digital sucking is responsible for causing significant changes in the maxilla and in the mandible during the growth period.\n\n【15】In general, the maxilla becomes narrow and V shaped, the mandible tends to be retrognathic, and, as a consequence, a significant open bite is developed with proclined upper incisors and retruded lower incisors.\n\n【16】Due to the excessive proclination of the upper incisors, lips become incompetent and the tongue is placed between the upper and lower incisors during the swallowing process, worsening it.\n\n【17】Also, there is a significant link between the respiration mode, the direction of the facial growth, and the development of the malocclusions (posterior cross bite and anterior open bite), due to abnormal contraction of the cheek muscles.\n\n【18】Hypertrophic lymphoid tissues and nasal obstruction in combination with large adenoids and tonsils are the most common cause of nasal obstruction and mouth breathing as they push the tongue forward due to pain and decrease in the amount of posterior space for the tongue.\n\n【19】This atypical swallowing pattern and the anterior posture of the tongue at rest prevent the eruption of the incisors and increase the anterior open bite with lower lip interposition every time the patient swallows.\n\n【20】In general, these young patients are sent to the speech therapist in order to improve the pronunciation of certain words, but it is important to remember that the anterior open bite is the consequence, not the cause.\n\n【21】Also, orofacial and speech dysfunction could be combined with problems at the TMJ that could worsen in the future.\n\n【22】In addition to TMJ problems, episodes of sleep apnea could be added. The child could stop breathing several times during the night (20–40 times per hour of sleep). As a consequence, he or she would feel daytime sleepiness, headaches, fatigue, obesity, changes in personality, lack of attention at school in the morning, etc.\n\n【23】Since sleep apnea is a progressive disorder, the consultation with the specialist is very important from the first day in order to perform a multi- and interdisciplinary treatment plan and avoid relapse (Pascually et al.).\n\n【24】It is important to remember that sleepwalking in young children and enuresis are commonly related to open bite problems.\n\n【25】The real question is who, when, why, and how to treat.\n\n【26】The higher the percentage of environmental factors in relation to the genetic ones, the better the prognosis. Among the deleterious habits, the prolonged use of pacifiers, mouth breathing, or thumb-sucking are determinants. In some patients, the help of a psychologist is fundamental to control the habits.\n\n【27】Unfortunately, there isn’t only one type of appliance to treat all these patients. The appliance selection has to be related to the etiology, age of the patient, seriousness of the problem, etc. The orthodontist is responsible for the appropriate selection.\n\n【28】The decision of whether to use a removable, fixed appliance or a combination of both is related to the etiology and the skeletal maturity in order to maximize the effectiveness of the orthodontic treatment.\n\n【29】The normalization of the vertical dimension is extremely challenging for the orthodontist to control, especially in high-angle patients with mouth breathing.\n\n【30】If problems leading to an open bite could be identified and treated early, it might be possible to minimize or even eliminate an undesirable pattern of growth.\n\n【31】According to the structures affected, anterior open bite can be divided into three main categories: dental, dentoalveolar, and skeletal.\n\n【32】Dental and dentoalveolar open bites develop as a result of prolonged mechanical blockage of the normal vertical development of anterior teeth and alveolar process 删除10：<u>(Torres et al. 2012 )</u>.\n\n【33】The skeletal form, in turn, is characterized by a significant vertical skeletal discrepancy, with features such as counterclockwise rotation of the palatine process, increased lower anterior facial height and gonial angle, short mandibular ramus, and increased posterior dentoalveolar height in both mandible and maxilla.\n\n【34】3.1 Diagnosis\n-------------\n\n【35】   Medical and dental analysis\n\n【36】   Patients’ chief complaint\n\n【37】   Evaluation of growth\n\n【38】   Functional analysis\n\n【39】   Photographic and radiologic evaluation\n\n【40】   Vertical facial pattern\n\n【41】   Unfavorable growth pattern\n\n【42】The treatment goals should include the removal of the etiological and environmental factors to permit the normalization of the anterior growth development.\n\n【43】Until now, no consensus has been reached to determine the best time to initiate the orthopedic/orthodontic treatment. Nonetheless, it is totally accepted that the earlier the correction of the open bite begins, the better the results will be. Also, early treatment helps avoid relapse.\n\n【44】Myofunctional therapy is the best option to normalize mouth breathing.\n\n【45】Control and reduction of the extrusion of the molars are fundamental to allow a counterclockwise rotation of the mandible to maintain the results.\n\n【46】Failure to control bad habits may be the most important reason of relapse.\n\n【47】The role of the otolaryngologist to improve and normalize nasal breathing during the diagnosis process and speech pathology is of prime importance.\n\n【48】In general, anterior open bite in temporary or early mixed dentition is associated with digital sucking habit and tongue anterior interposition.\n\n【49】Its correction is very important since otherwise the problem could worsen and turn into a skeletal alteration.\n\n【50】The size and length of the lips are also important to maintain a proper lip seal during day and night. Also, it is necessary to normalize the position and function of the tongue.\n\n【51】Normally, children who breathe through their mouth have a narrow maxillary arch, protrusive incisors, Class II occlusion, convex facial profile, bags under the eyes, an open mouth posture, and narrow nostrils.\n\n【52】The importance of the multidisciplinary treatment cannot be denied.\n\n【53】Treatment strategies are in close relationship with etiology, facial biotype, age of the patient, and clinical experiences.\n\n【54】The management of the tongue thrust and mouth breathing involves the interception of the habit. First of all, the doctor has to determine that the patient can use his/her nose to breathe normally.\n\n【55】It is important to remember that mouth breathing is abnormal and can affect the whole stomatognathic system, body posture, etc. and not only the position of the teeth.\n\n【56】As soon as this problem is corrected, fewer consequences appear.\n\n【57】Different appliances could be used according to the age of the patient and his/her medical history, in order to establish a new neuromuscular pattern.\n\n【58】According to the etiology and the importance of the problem, removable, fixed, or a combination of both types of appliances can be used.\n\n【59】The orthodontist has the final decision.\n\n【60】The following examples will describe each option in detail.\n\n【61】This 6-year, 8-month-old patient is sent to the office by her family dentist in search of a second opinion regarding her anterior open bite.\n\n【62】An adenoidectomy was performed 4 months earlier.

The appliance selection has to be related to the etiology, age of the patient, seriousness of the problem, etc. The orthodontist is responsible for the appropriate selection.\n\n【28】The decision of whether to use a removable, fixed appliance or a combination of both is related to the etiology and the skeletal maturity in order to maximize the effectiveness of the orthodontic treatment.\n\n【29】The normalization of the vertical dimension is extremely challenging for the orthodontist to control, especially in high-angle patients with mouth breathing.\n\n【30】If problems leading to an open bite could be identified and treated early, it might be possible to minimize or even eliminate an undesirable pattern of growth.\n\n【31】According to the structures affected, anterior open bite can be divided into three main categories: dental, dentoalveolar, and skeletal.\n\n【32】Dental and dentoalveolar open bites develop as a result of prolonged mechanical blockage of the normal vertical development of anterior teeth and alveolar process 删除10：<u>(Torres et al. 2012 )</u>.\n\n【33】The skeletal form, in turn, is characterized by a significant vertical skeletal discrepancy, with features such as counterclockwise rotation of the palatine process, increased lower anterior facial height and gonial angle, short mandibular ramus, and increased posterior dentoalveolar height in both mandible and maxilla.\n\n【34】3.1 Diagnosis\n-------------\n\n【35】   Medical and dental analysis\n\n【36】   Patients’ chief complaint\n\n【37】   Evaluation of growth\n\n【38】   Functional analysis\n\n【39】   Photographic and radiologic evaluation\n\n【40】   Vertical facial pattern\n\n【41】   Unfavorable growth pattern\n\n【42】The treatment goals should include the removal of the etiological and environmental factors to permit the normalization of the anterior growth development.\n\n【43】Until now, no consensus has been reached to determine the best time to initiate the orthopedic/orthodontic treatment. Nonetheless, it is totally accepted that the earlier the correction of the open bite begins, the better the results will be. Also, early treatment helps avoid relapse.\n\n【44】Myofunctional therapy is the best option to normalize mouth breathing.\n\n【45】Control and reduction of the extrusion of the molars are fundamental to allow a counterclockwise rotation of the mandible to maintain the results.\n\n【46】Failure to control bad habits may be the most important reason of relapse.\n\n【47】The role of the otolaryngologist to improve and normalize nasal breathing during the diagnosis process and speech pathology is of prime importance.\n\n【48】In general, anterior open bite in temporary or early mixed dentition is associated with digital sucking habit and tongue anterior interposition.\n\n【49】Its correction is very important since otherwise the problem could worsen and turn into a skeletal alteration.\n\n【50】The size and length of the lips are also important to maintain a proper lip seal during day and night. Also, it is necessary to normalize the position and function of the tongue.\n\n【51】Normally, children who breathe through their mouth have a narrow maxillary arch, protrusive incisors, Class II occlusion, convex facial profile, bags under the eyes, an open mouth posture, and narrow nostrils.\n\n【52】The importance of the multidisciplinary treatment cannot be denied.\n\n【53】Treatment strategies are in close relationship with etiology, facial biotype, age of the patient, and clinical experiences.\n\n【54】The management of the tongue thrust and mouth breathing involves the interception of the habit. First of all, the doctor has to determine that the patient can use his/her nose to breathe normally.\n\n【55】It is important to remember that mouth breathing is abnormal and can affect the whole stomatognathic system, body posture, etc. and not only the position of the teeth.\n\n【56】As soon as this problem is corrected, fewer consequences appear.\n\n【57】Different appliances could be used according to the age of the patient and his/her medical history, in order to establish a new neuromuscular pattern.\n\n【58】According to the etiology and the importance of the problem, removable, fixed, or a combination of both types of appliances can be used.\n\n【59】The orthodontist has the final decision.\n\n【60】The following examples will describe each option in detail.\n\n【61】This 6-year, 8-month-old patient is sent to the office by her family dentist in search of a second opinion regarding her anterior open bite.\n\n【62】An adenoidectomy was performed 4 months earlier.

It is important to control the habit after 2 years of age. In some patients, the help of a psychologist is valuable.\n\n【14】Digital sucking is responsible for causing significant changes in the maxilla and in the mandible during the growth period.\n\n【15】In general, the maxilla becomes narrow and V shaped, the mandible tends to be retrognathic, and, as a consequence, a significant open bite is developed with proclined upper incisors and retruded lower incisors.\n\n【16】Due to the excessive proclination of the upper incisors, lips become incompetent and the tongue is placed between the upper and lower incisors during the swallowing process, worsening it.\n\n【17】Also, there is a significant link between the respiration mode, the direction of the facial growth, and the development of the malocclusions (posterior cross bite and anterior open bite), due to abnormal contraction of the cheek muscles.\n\n【18】Hypertrophic lymphoid tissues and nasal obstruction in combination with large adenoids and tonsils are the most common cause of nasal obstruction and mouth breathing as they push the tongue forward due to pain and decrease in the amount of posterior space for the tongue.\n\n【19】This atypical swallowing pattern and the anterior posture of the tongue at rest prevent the eruption of the incisors and increase the anterior open bite with lower lip interposition every time the patient swallows.\n\n【20】In general, these young patients are sent to the speech therapist in order to improve the pronunciation of certain words, but it is important to remember that the anterior open bite is the consequence, not the cause.\n\n【21】Also, orofacial and speech dysfunction could be combined with problems at the TMJ that could worsen in the future.\n\n【22】In addition to TMJ problems, episodes of sleep apnea could be added. The child could stop breathing several times during the night (20–40 times per hour of sleep). As a consequence, he or she would feel daytime sleepiness, headaches, fatigue, obesity, changes in personality, lack of attention at school in the morning, etc.\n\n【23】Since sleep apnea is a progressive disorder, the consultation with the specialist is very important from the first day in order to perform a multi- and interdisciplinary treatment plan and avoid relapse (Pascually et al.).\n\n【24】It is important to remember that sleepwalking in young children and enuresis are commonly related to open bite problems.\n\n【25】The real question is who, when, why, and how to treat.\n\n【26】The higher the percentage of environmental factors in relation to the genetic ones, the better the prognosis. Among the deleterious habits, the prolonged use of pacifiers, mouth breathing, or thumb-sucking are determinants. In some patients, the help of a psychologist is fundamental to control the habits.\n\n【27】Unfortunately, there isn’t only one type of appliance to treat all these patients. The appliance selection has to be related to the etiology, age of the patient, seriousness of the problem, etc. The orthodontist is responsible for the appropriate selection.\n\n【28】The decision of whether to use a removable, fixed appliance or a combination of both is related to the etiology and the skeletal maturity in order to maximize the effectiveness of the orthodontic treatment.\n\n【29】The normalization of the vertical dimension is extremely challenging for the orthodontist to control, especially in high-angle patients with mouth breathing.\n\n【30】If problems leading to an open bite could be identified and treated early, it might be possible to minimize or even eliminate an undesirable pattern of growth.\n\n【31】According to the structures affected, anterior open bite can be divided into three main categories: dental, dentoalveolar, and skeletal.\n\n【32】Dental and dentoalveolar open bites develop as a result of prolonged mechanical blockage of the normal vertical development of anterior teeth and alveolar process 删除10：<u>(Torres et al. 2012 )</u>.\n\n【33】The skeletal form, in turn, is characterized by a significant vertical skeletal discrepancy, with features such as counterclockwise rotation of the palatine process, increased lower anterior facial height and gonial angle, short mandibular ramus, and increased posterior dentoalveolar height in both mandible and maxilla.\n\n【34】3.1 Diagnosis\n-------------\n\n【35】   Medical and dental analysis\n\n【36】   Patients’ chief complaint\n\n【37】   Evaluation of growth\n\n【38】   Functional analysis\n\n【39】   Photographic and radiologic evaluation\n\n【40】   Vertical facial pattern\n\n【41】   Unfavorable growth pattern\n\n【42】The treatment goals should include the removal of the etiological and environmental factors to permit the normalization of the anterior growth development.\n\n【43】Until now, no consensus has been reached to determine the best time to initiate the orthopedic/orthodontic treatment.

It is important to control the habit after 2 years of age. In some patients, the help of a psychologist is valuable.\n\n【14】Digital sucking is responsible for causing significant changes in the maxilla and in the mandible during the growth period.\n\n【15】In general, the maxilla becomes narrow and V shaped, the mandible tends to be retrognathic, and, as a consequence, a significant open bite is developed with proclined upper incisors and retruded lower incisors.\n\n【16】Due to the excessive proclination of the upper incisors, lips become incompetent and the tongue is placed between the upper and lower incisors during the swallowing process, worsening it.\n\n【17】Also, there is a significant link between the respiration mode, the direction of the facial growth, and the development of the malocclusions (posterior cross bite and anterior open bite), due to abnormal contraction of the cheek muscles.\n\n【18】Hypertrophic lymphoid tissues and nasal obstruction in combination with large adenoids and tonsils are the most common cause of nasal obstruction and mouth breathing as they push the tongue forward due to pain and decrease in the amount of posterior space for the tongue.\n\n【19】This atypical swallowing pattern and the anterior posture of the tongue at rest prevent the eruption of the incisors and increase the anterior open bite with lower lip interposition every time the patient swallows.\n\n【20】In general, these young patients are sent to the speech therapist in order to improve the pronunciation of certain words, but it is important to remember that the anterior open bite is the consequence, not the cause.\n\n【21】Also, orofacial and speech dysfunction could be combined with problems at the TMJ that could worsen in the future.\n\n【22】In addition to TMJ problems, episodes of sleep apnea could be added. The child could stop breathing several times during the night (20–40 times per hour of sleep). As a consequence, he or she would feel daytime sleepiness, headaches, fatigue, obesity, changes in personality, lack of attention at school in the morning, etc.\n\n【23】Since sleep apnea is a progressive disorder, the consultation with the specialist is very important from the first day in order to perform a multi- and interdisciplinary treatment plan and avoid relapse (Pascually et al.).\n\n【24】It is important to remember that sleepwalking in young children and enuresis are commonly related to open bite problems.\n\n【25】The real question is who, when, why, and how to treat.\n\n【26】The higher the percentage of environmental factors in relation to the genetic ones, the better the prognosis. Among the deleterious habits, the prolonged use of pacifiers, mouth breathing, or thumb-sucking are determinants. In some patients, the help of a psychologist is fundamental to control the habits.\n\n【27】Unfortunately, there isn’t only one type of appliance to treat all these patients. The appliance selection has to be related to the etiology, age of the patient, seriousness of the problem, etc. The orthodontist is responsible for the appropriate selection.\n\n【28】The decision of whether to use a removable, fixed appliance or a combination of both is related to the etiology and the skeletal maturity in order to maximize the effectiveness of the orthodontic treatment.\n\n【29】The normalization of the vertical dimension is extremely challenging for the orthodontist to control, especially in high-angle patients with mouth breathing.\n\n【30】If problems leading to an open bite could be identified and treated early, it might be possible to minimize or even eliminate an undesirable pattern of growth.\n\n【31】According to the structures affected, anterior open bite can be divided into three main categories: dental, dentoalveolar, and skeletal.\n\n【32】Dental and dentoalveolar open bites develop as a result of prolonged mechanical blockage of the normal vertical development of anterior teeth and alveolar process 删除10：<u>(Torres et al. 2012 )</u>.\n\n【33】The skeletal form, in turn, is characterized by a significant vertical skeletal discrepancy, with features such as counterclockwise rotation of the palatine process, increased lower anterior facial height and gonial angle, short mandibular ramus, and increased posterior dentoalveolar height in both mandible and maxilla.\n\n【34】3.1 Diagnosis\n-------------\n\n【35】   Medical and dental analysis\n\n【36】   Patients’ chief complaint\n\n【37】   Evaluation of growth\n\n【38】   Functional analysis\n\n【39】   Photographic and radiologic evaluation\n\n【40】   Vertical facial pattern\n\n【41】   Unfavorable growth pattern\n\n【42】The treatment goals should include the removal of the etiological and environmental factors to permit the normalization of the anterior growth development.\n\n【43】Until now, no consensus has been reached to determine the best time to initiate the orthopedic/orthodontic treatment. Nonetheless, it is totally accepted that the earlier the correction of the open bite begins, the better the results will be. Also, early treatment helps avoid relapse.\n\n【44】Myofunctional therapy is the best option to normalize mouth breathing.\n\n【45】Control and reduction of the extrusion of the molars are fundamental to allow a counterclockwise rotation of the mandible to maintain the results.\n\n【46】Failure to control bad habits may be the most important reason of relapse.\n\n【47】The role of the otolaryngologist to improve and normalize nasal breathing during the diagnosis process and speech pathology is of prime importance.\n\n【48】In general, anterior open bite in temporary or early mixed dentition is associated with digital sucking habit and tongue anterior interposition.\n\n【49】Its correction is very important since otherwise the problem could worsen and turn into a skeletal alteration.\n\n【50】The size and length of the lips are also important to maintain a proper lip seal during day and night. Also, it is necessary to normalize the position and function of the tongue.\n\n【51】Normally, children who breathe through their mouth have a narrow maxillary arch, protrusive incisors, Class II occlusion, convex facial profile, bags under the eyes, an open mouth posture, and narrow nostrils.\n\n【52】The importance of the multidisciplinary treatment cannot be denied.\n\n【53】Treatment strategies are in close relationship with etiology, facial biotype, age of the patient, and clinical experiences.\n\n【54】The management of the tongue thrust and mouth breathing involves the interception of the habit. First of all, the doctor has to determine that the patient can use his/her nose to breathe normally.\n\n【55】It is important to remember that mouth breathing is abnormal and can affect the whole stomatognathic system, body posture, etc. and not only the position of the teeth.\n\n【56】As soon as this problem is corrected, fewer consequences appear.\n\n【57】Different appliances could be used according to the age of the patient and his/her medical history, in order to establish a new neuromuscular pattern.\n\n【58】According to the etiology and the importance of the problem, removable, fixed, or a combination of both types of appliances can be used.\n\n【59】The orthodontist has the final decision.\n\n【60】The following examples will describe each option in detail.\n\n【61】This 6-year, 8-month-old patient is sent to the office by her family dentist in search of a second opinion regarding her anterior open bite.\n\n【62】An adenoidectomy was performed 4 months earlier. Nonetheless, mouth breathing and tongue thrusting continued. It was difficult for her to close and maintain the lips sealed.

It also helps to improve dental arch development during the early and late mixed dentition, and most importantly, this appliance helps normalize bad habits.\n\n【80】Also, other types of functional appliances can be used according to the orthodontist’s preferences.

It is important to control the habit after 2 years of age. In some patients, the help of a psychologist is valuable.\n\n【14】Digital sucking is responsible for causing significant changes in the maxilla and in the mandible during the growth period.\n\n【15】In general, the maxilla becomes narrow and V shaped, the mandible tends to be retrognathic, and, as a consequence, a significant open bite is developed with proclined upper incisors and retruded lower incisors.\n\n【16】Due to the excessive proclination of the upper incisors, lips become incompetent and the tongue is placed between the upper and lower incisors during the swallowing process, worsening it.\n\n【17】Also, there is a significant link between the respiration mode, the direction of the facial growth, and the development of the malocclusions (posterior cross bite and anterior open bite), due to abnormal contraction of the cheek muscles.\n\n【18】Hypertrophic lymphoid tissues and nasal obstruction in combination with large adenoids and tonsils are the most common cause of nasal obstruction and mouth breathing as they push the tongue forward due to pain and decrease in the amount of posterior space for the tongue.\n\n【19】This atypical swallowing pattern and the anterior posture of the tongue at rest prevent the eruption of the incisors and increase the anterior open bite with lower lip interposition every time the patient swallows.\n\n【20】In general, these young patients are sent to the speech therapist in order to improve the pronunciation of certain words, but it is important to remember that the anterior open bite is the consequence, not the cause.\n\n【21】Also, orofacial and speech dysfunction could be combined with problems at the TMJ that could worsen in the future.\n\n【22】In addition to TMJ problems, episodes of sleep apnea could be added. The child could stop breathing several times during the night (20–40 times per hour of sleep). As a consequence, he or she would feel daytime sleepiness, headaches, fatigue, obesity, changes in personality, lack of attention at school in the morning, etc.\n\n【23】Since sleep apnea is a progressive disorder, the consultation with the specialist is very important from the first day in order to perform a multi- and interdisciplinary treatment plan and avoid relapse (Pascually et al.).\n\n【24】It is important to remember that sleepwalking in young children and enuresis are commonly related to open bite problems.\n\n【25】The real question is who, when, why, and how to treat.\n\n【26】The higher the percentage of environmental factors in relation to the genetic ones, the better the prognosis. Among the deleterious habits, the prolonged use of pacifiers, mouth breathing, or thumb-sucking are determinants. In some patients, the help of a psychologist is fundamental to control the habits.\n\n【27】Unfortunately, there isn’t only one type of appliance to treat all these patients. The appliance selection has to be related to the etiology, age of the patient, seriousness of the problem, etc. The orthodontist is responsible for the appropriate selection.\n\n【28】The decision of whether to use a removable, fixed appliance or a combination of both is related to the etiology and the skeletal maturity in order to maximize the effectiveness of the orthodontic treatment.\n\n【29】The normalization of the vertical dimension is extremely challenging for the orthodontist to control, especially in high-angle patients with mouth breathing.\n\n【30】If problems leading to an open bite could be identified and treated early, it might be possible to minimize or even eliminate an undesirable pattern of growth.\n\n【31】According to the structures affected, anterior open bite can be divided into three main categories: dental, dentoalveolar, and skeletal.\n\n【32】Dental and dentoalveolar open bites develop as a result of prolonged mechanical blockage of the normal vertical development of anterior teeth and alveolar process 删除10：<u>(Torres et al. 2012 )</u>.\n\n【33】The skeletal form, in turn, is characterized by a significant vertical skeletal discrepancy, with features such as counterclockwise rotation of the palatine process, increased lower anterior facial height and gonial angle, short mandibular ramus, and increased posterior dentoalveolar height in both mandible and maxilla.\n\n【34】3.1 Diagnosis\n-------------\n\n【35】   Medical and dental analysis\n\n【36】   Patients’ chief complaint\n\n【37】   Evaluation of growth\n\n【38】   Functional analysis\n\n【39】   Photographic and radiologic evaluation\n\n【40】   Vertical facial pattern\n\n【41】   Unfavorable growth pattern\n\n【42】The treatment goals should include the removal of the etiological and environmental factors to permit the normalization of the anterior growth development.\n\n【43】Until now, no consensus has been reached to determine the best time to initiate the orthopedic/orthodontic treatment. Nonetheless, it is totally accepted that the earlier the correction of the open bite begins, the better the results will be. Also, early treatment helps avoid relapse.\n\n【44】Myofunctional therapy is the best option to normalize mouth breathing.\n\n【45】Control and reduction of the extrusion of the molars are fundamental to allow a counterclockwise rotation of the mandible to maintain the results.\n\n【46】Failure to control bad habits may be the most important reason of relapse.\n\n【47】The role of the otolaryngologist to improve and normalize nasal breathing during the diagnosis process and speech pathology is of prime importance.\n\n【48】In general, anterior open bite in temporary or early mixed dentition is associated with digital sucking habit and tongue anterior interposition.\n\n【49】Its correction is very important since otherwise the problem could worsen and turn into a skeletal alteration.\n\n【50】The size and length of the lips are also important to maintain a proper lip seal during day and night. Also, it is necessary to normalize the position and function of the tongue.\n\n【51】Normally, children who breathe through their mouth have a narrow maxillary arch, protrusive incisors, Class II occlusion, convex facial profile, bags under the eyes, an open mouth posture, and narrow nostrils.\n\n【52】The importance of the multidisciplinary treatment cannot be denied.\n\n【53】Treatment strategies are in close relationship with etiology, facial biotype, age of the patient, and clinical experiences.\n\n【54】The management of the tongue thrust and mouth breathing involves the interception of the habit. First of all, the doctor has to determine that the patient can use his/her nose to breathe normally.\n\n【55】It is important to remember that mouth breathing is abnormal and can affect the whole stomatognathic system, body posture, etc. and not only the position of the teeth.\n\n【56】As soon as this problem is corrected, fewer consequences appear.\n\n【57】Different appliances could be used according to the age of the patient and his/her medical history, in order to establish a new neuromuscular pattern.\n\n【58】According to the etiology and the importance of the problem, removable, fixed, or a combination of both types of appliances can be used.\n\n【59】The orthodontist has the final decision.\n\n【60】The following examples will describe each option in detail.\n\n【61】This 6-year, 8-month-old patient is sent to the office by her family dentist in search of a second opinion regarding her anterior open bite.\n\n【62】An adenoidectomy was performed 4 months earlier. Nonetheless, mouth breathing and tongue thrusting continued. It was difficult for her to close and maintain the lips sealed.

Of all the possible choices, a prefabricated functional appliance also known as Trainer System TM (Myofunctional Research Co. Australia) was chosen. It is fabricated with a special type of polyurethane and helps the correction and normalization of the muscular dysfunction.\n\n【70】The appliance is especially designed to stimulate anterior and lateral muscles and help to achieve normal nasal breathing. Since the material is soft, no major problems of adaptation are present .\n删除3：<u>Fig. 3.4\n\n【71】( a , b ) In order to achieve nasal breathing, a pre-orthodontic trainer was recommended.

It also helps to improve dental arch development during the early and late mixed dentition, and most importantly, this appliance helps normalize bad habits.\n\n【80】Also, other types of functional appliances can be used according to the orthodontist’s preferences.

It is important to control the habit after 2 years of age. In some patients, the help of a psychologist is valuable.\n\n【14】Digital sucking is responsible for causing significant changes in the maxilla and in the mandible during the growth period.\n\n【15】In general, the maxilla becomes narrow and V shaped, the mandible tends to be retrognathic, and, as a consequence, a significant open bite is developed with proclined upper incisors and retruded lower incisors.\n\n【16】Due to the excessive proclination of the upper incisors, lips become incompetent and the tongue is placed between the upper and lower incisors during the swallowing process, worsening it.\n\n【17】Also, there is a significant link between the respiration mode, the direction of the facial growth, and the development of the malocclusions (posterior cross bite and anterior open bite), due to abnormal contraction of the cheek muscles.\n\n【18】Hypertrophic lymphoid tissues and nasal obstruction in combination with large adenoids and tonsils are the most common cause of nasal obstruction and mouth breathing as they push the tongue forward due to pain and decrease in the amount of posterior space for the tongue.\n\n【19】This atypical swallowing pattern and the anterior posture of the tongue at rest prevent the eruption of the incisors and increase the anterior open bite with lower lip interposition every time the patient swallows.\n\n【20】In general, these young patients are sent to the speech therapist in order to improve the pronunciation of certain words, but it is important to remember that the anterior open bite is the consequence, not the cause.\n\n【21】Also, orofacial and speech dysfunction could be combined with problems at the TMJ that could worsen in the future.\n\n【22】In addition to TMJ problems, episodes of sleep apnea could be added. The child could stop breathing several times during the night (20–40 times per hour of sleep). As a consequence, he or she would feel daytime sleepiness, headaches, fatigue, obesity, changes in personality, lack of attention at school in the morning, etc.\n\n【23】Since sleep apnea is a progressive disorder, the consultation with the specialist is very important from the first day in order to perform a multi- and interdisciplinary treatment plan and avoid relapse (Pascually et al.).\n\n【24】It is important to remember that sleepwalking in young children and enuresis are commonly related to open bite problems.\n\n【25】The real question is who, when, why, and how to treat.\n\n【26】The higher the percentage of environmental factors in relation to the genetic ones, the better the prognosis. Among the deleterious habits, the prolonged use of pacifiers, mouth breathing, or thumb-sucking are determinants. In some patients, the help of a psychologist is fundamental to control the habits.\n\n【27】Unfortunately, there isn’t only one type of appliance to treat all these patients. The appliance selection has to be related to the etiology, age of the patient, seriousness of the problem, etc. The orthodontist is responsible for the appropriate selection.\n\n【28】The decision of whether to use a removable, fixed appliance or a combination of both is related to the etiology and the skeletal maturity in order to maximize the effectiveness of the orthodontic treatment.\n\n【29】The normalization of the vertical dimension is extremely challenging for the orthodontist to control, especially in high-angle patients with mouth breathing.\n\n【30】If problems leading to an open bite could be identified and treated early, it might be possible to minimize or even eliminate an undesirable pattern of growth.\n\n【31】According to the structures affected, anterior open bite can be divided into three main categories: dental, dentoalveolar, and skeletal.\n\n【32】Dental and dentoalveolar open bites develop as a result of prolonged mechanical blockage of the normal vertical development of anterior teeth and alveolar process 删除10：<u>(Torres et al. 2012 )</u>.\n\n【33】The skeletal form, in turn, is characterized by a significant vertical skeletal discrepancy, with features such as counterclockwise rotation of the palatine process, increased lower anterior facial height and gonial angle, short mandibular ramus, and increased posterior dentoalveolar height in both mandible and maxilla.\n\n【34】3.1 Diagnosis\n-------------\n\n【35】   Medical and dental analysis\n\n【36】   Patients’ chief complaint\n\n【37】   Evaluation of growth\n\n【38】   Functional analysis\n\n【39】   Photographic and radiologic evaluation\n\n【40】   Vertical facial pattern\n\n【41】   Unfavorable growth pattern\n\n【42】The treatment goals should include the removal of the etiological and environmental factors to permit the normalization of the anterior growth development.\n\n【43】Until now, no consensus has been reached to determine the best time to initiate the orthopedic/orthodontic treatment. Nonetheless, it is totally accepted that the earlier the correction of the open bite begins, the better the results will be. Also, early treatment helps avoid relapse.\n\n【44】Myofunctional therapy is the best option to normalize mouth breathing.\n\n【45】Control and reduction of the extrusion of the molars are fundamental to allow a counterclockwise rotation of the mandible to maintain the results.\n\n【46】Failure to control bad habits may be the most important reason of relapse.\n\n【47】The role of the otolaryngologist to improve and normalize nasal breathing during the diagnosis process and speech pathology is of prime importance.\n\n【48】In general, anterior open bite in temporary or early mixed dentition is associated with digital sucking habit and tongue anterior interposition.\n\n【49】Its correction is very important since otherwise the problem could worsen and turn into a skeletal alteration.\n\n【50】The size and length of the lips are also important to maintain a proper lip seal during day and night. Also, it is necessary to normalize the position and function of the tongue.\n\n【51】Normally, children who breathe through their mouth have a narrow maxillary arch, protrusive incisors, Class II occlusion, convex facial profile, bags under the eyes, an open mouth posture, and narrow nostrils.\n\n【52】The importance of the multidisciplinary treatment cannot be denied.\n\n【53】Treatment strategies are in close relationship with etiology, facial biotype, age of the patient, and clinical experiences.\n\n【54】The management of the tongue thrust and mouth breathing involves the interception of the habit. First of all, the doctor has to determine that the patient can use his/her nose to breathe normally.\n\n【55】It is important to remember that mouth breathing is abnormal and can affect the whole stomatognathic system, body posture, etc. and not only the position of the teeth.\n\n【56】As soon as this problem is corrected, fewer consequences appear.\n\n【57】Different appliances could be used according to the age of the patient and his/her medical history, in order to establish a new neuromuscular pattern.\n\n【58】According to the etiology and the importance of the problem, removable, fixed, or a combination of both types of appliances can be used.\n\n【59】The orthodontist has the final decision.\n\n【60】The following examples will describe each option in detail.\n\n【61】This 6-year, 8-month-old patient is sent to the office by her family dentist in search of a second opinion regarding her anterior open bite.\n\n【62】An adenoidectomy was performed 4 months earlier.

Also, early treatment helps avoid relapse.\n\n【44】Myofunctional therapy is the best option to normalize mouth breathing.\n\n【45】Control and reduction of the extrusion of the molars are fundamental to allow a counterclockwise rotation of the mandible to maintain the results.\n\n【46】Failure to control bad habits may be the most important reason of relapse.\n\n【47】The role of the otolaryngologist to improve and normalize nasal breathing during the diagnosis process and speech pathology is of prime importance.\n\n【48】In general, anterior open bite in temporary or early mixed dentition is associated with digital sucking habit and tongue anterior interposition.\n\n【49】Its correction is very important since otherwise the problem could worsen and turn into a skeletal alteration.\n\n【50】The size and length of the lips are also important to maintain a proper lip seal during day and night. Also, it is necessary to normalize the position and function of the tongue.\n\n【51】Normally, children who breathe through their mouth have a narrow maxillary arch, protrusive incisors, Class II occlusion, convex facial profile, bags under the eyes, an open mouth posture, and narrow nostrils.\n\n【52】The importance of the multidisciplinary treatment cannot be denied.\n\n【53】Treatment strategies are in close relationship with etiology, facial biotype, age of the patient, and clinical experiences.\n\n【54】The management of the tongue thrust and mouth breathing involves the interception of the habit. First of all, the doctor has to determine that the patient can use his/her nose to breathe normally.\n\n【55】It is important to remember that mouth breathing is abnormal and can affect the whole stomatognathic system, body posture, etc. and not only the position of the teeth.\n\n【56】As soon as this problem is corrected, fewer consequences appear.\n\n【57】Different appliances could be used according to the age of the patient and his/her medical history, in order to establish a new neuromuscular pattern.\n\n【58】According to the etiology and the importance of the problem, removable, fixed, or a combination of both types of appliances can be used.\n\n【59】The orthodontist has the final decision.\n\n【60】The following examples will describe each option in detail.\n\n【61】This 6-year, 8-month-old patient is sent to the office by her family dentist in search of a second opinion regarding her anterior open bite.\n\n【62】An adenoidectomy was performed 4 months earlier.

It is important to control the habit after 2 years of age. In some patients, the help of a psychologist is valuable.\n\n【14】Digital sucking is responsible for causing significant changes in the maxilla and in the mandible during the growth period.\n\n【15】In general, the maxilla becomes narrow and V shaped, the mandible tends to be retrognathic, and, as a consequence, a significant open bite is developed with proclined upper incisors and retruded lower incisors.\n\n【16】Due to the excessive proclination of the upper incisors, lips become incompetent and the tongue is placed between the upper and lower incisors during the swallowing process, worsening it.\n\n【17】Also, there is a significant link between the respiration mode, the direction of the facial growth, and the development of the malocclusions (posterior cross bite and anterior open bite), due to abnormal contraction of the cheek muscles.\n\n【18】Hypertrophic lymphoid tissues and nasal obstruction in combination with large adenoids and tonsils are the most common cause of nasal obstruction and mouth breathing as they push the tongue forward due to pain and decrease in the amount of posterior space for the tongue.\n\n【19】This atypical swallowing pattern and the anterior posture of the tongue at rest prevent the eruption of the incisors and increase the anterior open bite with lower lip interposition every time the patient swallows.\n\n【20】In general, these young patients are sent to the speech therapist in order to improve the pronunciation of certain words, but it is important to remember that the anterior open bite is the consequence, not the cause.\n\n【21】Also, orofacial and speech dysfunction could be combined with problems at the TMJ that could worsen in the future.\n\n【22】In addition to TMJ problems, episodes of sleep apnea could be added. The child could stop breathing several times during the night (20–40 times per hour of sleep). As a consequence, he or she would feel daytime sleepiness, headaches, fatigue, obesity, changes in personality, lack of attention at school in the morning, etc.\n\n【23】Since sleep apnea is a progressive disorder, the consultation with the specialist is very important from the first day in order to perform a multi- and interdisciplinary treatment plan and avoid relapse (Pascually et al.).\n\n【24】It is important to remember that sleepwalking in young children and enuresis are commonly related to open bite problems.\n\n【25】The real question is who, when, why, and how to treat.\n\n【26】The higher the percentage of environmental factors in relation to the genetic ones, the better the prognosis. Among the deleterious habits, the prolonged use of pacifiers, mouth breathing, or thumb-sucking are determinants. In some patients, the help of a psychologist is fundamental to control the habits.\n\n【27】Unfortunately, there isn’t only one type of appliance to treat all these patients. The appliance selection has to be related to the etiology, age of the patient, seriousness of the problem, etc. The orthodontist is responsible for the appropriate selection.\n\n【28】The decision of whether to use a removable, fixed appliance or a combination of both is related to the etiology and the skeletal maturity in order to maximize the effectiveness of the orthodontic treatment.\n\n【29】The normalization of the vertical dimension is extremely challenging for the orthodontist to control, especially in high-angle patients with mouth breathing.\n\n【30】If problems leading to an open bite could be identified and treated early, it might be possible to minimize or even eliminate an undesirable pattern of growth.\n\n【31】According to the structures affected, anterior open bite can be divided into three main categories: dental, dentoalveolar, and skeletal.\n\n【32】Dental and dentoalveolar open bites develop as a result of prolonged mechanical blockage of the normal vertical development of anterior teeth and alveolar process 删除10：<u>(Torres et al. 2012 )</u>.\n\n【33】The skeletal form, in turn, is characterized by a significant vertical skeletal discrepancy, with features such as counterclockwise rotation of the palatine process, increased lower anterior facial height and gonial angle, short mandibular ramus, and increased posterior dentoalveolar height in both mandible and maxilla.\n\n【34】3.1 Diagnosis\n-------------\n\n【35】   Medical and dental analysis\n\n【36】   Patients’ chief complaint\n\n【37】   Evaluation of growth\n\n【38】   Functional analysis\n\n【39】   Photographic and radiologic evaluation\n\n【40】   Vertical facial pattern\n\n【41】   Unfavorable growth pattern\n\n【42】The treatment goals should include the removal of the etiological and environmental factors to permit the normalization of the anterior growth development.\n\n【43】Until now, no consensus has been reached to determine the best time to initiate the orthopedic/orthodontic treatment.

Early Treatment of Open Bite Problems\n========================================\n\n【3】删除2：<u>Julia Harfin <sup>1<a><span class=\"ContactIcon\"></span></a></sup>\n\n【4】通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>\n\n【5】Department of Orthodontics, Maimonides University, Buenos Aires, Argentina\n\n【6】Julia Harfin\n\n【7】Email: harfinjulia@gmail.com</u>\n\n【8】The normalization of functional disturbances is one of the main objectives that need to be achieved during early orthodontic treatment.\n\n【9】There is a close relationship between anterior open bite in young patients and abnormal habits that are some of the main etiological factors of malocclusion.\n\n【10】The most common habits are thumb-sucking, lip/nail biting, tongue thrusting, and mouth breathing mode.\n\n【11】Normally, all of these habits could cause interferences with the circumoral musculature and tongue pressure balance, and as a consequence, they develop unaltered maxillary and mandibular arch forms.\n\n【12】Of course, the duration, frequency, and intensity of these habits play an important role, not only in the diagnosis and treatment plan but also during the whole retention phase.\n\n【13】Since there isn’t only one reason for digital sucking or the prolonged use of pacifiers, there isn’t only one treatment for all of them. It is important to control the habit after 2 years of age. In some patients, the help of a psychologist is valuable.\n\n【14】Digital sucking is responsible for causing significant changes in the maxilla and in the mandible during the growth period.\n\n【15】In general, the maxilla becomes narrow and V shaped, the mandible tends to be retrognathic, and, as a consequence, a significant open bite is developed with proclined upper incisors and retruded lower incisors.\n\n【16】Due to the excessive proclination of the upper incisors, lips become incompetent and the tongue is placed between the upper and lower incisors during the swallowing process, worsening it.\n\n【17】Also, there is a significant link between the respiration mode, the direction of the facial growth, and the development of the malocclusions (posterior cross bite and anterior open bite), due to abnormal contraction of the cheek muscles.\n\n【18】Hypertrophic lymphoid tissues and nasal obstruction in combination with large adenoids and tonsils are the most common cause of nasal obstruction and mouth breathing as they push the tongue forward due to pain and decrease in the amount of posterior space for the tongue.\n\n【19】This atypical swallowing pattern and the anterior posture of the tongue at rest prevent the eruption of the incisors and increase the anterior open bite with lower lip interposition every time the patient swallows.\n\n【20】In general, these young patients are sent to the speech therapist in order to improve the pronunciation of certain words, but it is important to remember that the anterior open bite is the consequence, not the cause.\n\n【21】Also, orofacial and speech dysfunction could be combined with problems at the TMJ that could worsen in the future.\n\n【22】In addition to TMJ problems, episodes of sleep apnea could be added. The child could stop breathing several times during the night (20–40 times per hour of sleep). As a consequence, he or she would feel daytime sleepiness, headaches, fatigue, obesity, changes in personality, lack of attention at school in the morning, etc.\n\n【23】Since sleep apnea is a progressive disorder, the consultation with the specialist is very important from the first day in order to perform a multi- and interdisciplinary treatment plan and avoid relapse (Pascually et al.).\n\n【24】It is important to remember that sleepwalking in young children and enuresis are commonly related to open bite problems.\n\n【25】The real question is who, when, why, and how to treat.\n\n【26】The higher the percentage of environmental factors in relation to the genetic ones, the better the prognosis. Among the deleterious habits, the prolonged use of pacifiers, mouth breathing, or thumb-sucking are determinants. In some patients, the help of a psychologist is fundamental to control the habits.\n\n【27】Unfortunately, there isn’t only one type of appliance to treat all these patients. The appliance selection has to be related to the etiology, age of the patient, seriousness of the problem, etc. The orthodontist is responsible for the appropriate selection.\n\n【28】The decision of whether to use a removable, fixed appliance or a combination of both is related to the etiology and the skeletal maturity in order to maximize the effectiveness of the orthodontic treatment.\n\n【29】The normalization of the vertical dimension is extremely challenging for the orthodontist to control, especially in high-angle patients with mouth breathing.\n\n【30】If problems leading to an open bite could be identified and treated early, it might be possible to minimize or even eliminate an undesirable pattern of growth.\n\n【31】According to the structures affected, anterior open bite can be divided into three main categories: dental, dentoalveolar, and skeletal.\n\n【32】Dental and dentoalveolar open bites develop as a result of prolonged mechanical blockage of the normal vertical development of anterior teeth and alveolar process 删除10：<u>(Torres et al. 2012 )</u>.\n\n【33】The skeletal form, in turn, is characterized by a significant vertical skeletal discrepancy, with features such as counterclockwise rotation of the palatine process, increased lower anterior facial height and gonial angle, short mandibular ramus, and increased posterior dentoalveolar height in both mandible and maxilla.\n\n【34】3.1 Diagnosis\n-------------\n\n【35】   Medical and dental analysis\n\n【36】   Patients’ chief complaint\n\n【37】   Evaluation of growth\n\n【38】   Functional analysis\n\n【39】   Photographic and radiologic evaluation\n\n【40】   Vertical facial pattern\n\n【41】   Unfavorable growth pattern\n\n【42】The treatment goals should include the removal of the etiological and environmental factors to permit the normalization of the anterior growth development.\n\n【43】Until now, no consensus has been reached to determine the best time to initiate the orthopedic/orthodontic treatment. Nonetheless, it is totally accepted that the earlier the correction of the open bite begins, the better the results will be. Also, early treatment helps avoid relapse.\n\n【44】Myofunctional therapy is the best option to normalize mouth breathing.\n\n【45】Control and reduction of the extrusion of the molars are fundamental to allow a counterclockwise rotation of the mandible to maintain the results.\n\n【46】Failure to control bad habits may be the most important reason of relapse.\n\n【47】The role of the otolaryngologist to improve and normalize nasal breathing during the diagnosis process and speech pathology is of prime importance.\n\n【48】In general, anterior open bite in temporary or early mixed dentition is associated with digital sucking habit and tongue anterior interposition.\n\n【49】Its correction is very important since otherwise the problem could worsen and turn into a skeletal alteration.\n\n【50】The size and length of the lips are also important to maintain a proper lip seal during day and night. Also, it is necessary to normalize the position and function of the tongue.\n\n【51】Normally, children who breathe through their mouth have a narrow maxillary arch, protrusive incisors, Class II occlusion, convex facial profile, bags under the eyes, an open mouth posture, and narrow nostrils.\n\n【52】The importance of the multidisciplinary treatment cannot be denied.\n\n【53】Treatment strategies are in close relationship with etiology, facial biotype, age of the patient, and clinical experiences.\n\n【54】The management of the tongue thrust and mouth breathing involves the interception of the habit. First of all, the doctor has to determine that the patient can use his/her nose to breathe normally.\n\n【55】It is important to remember that mouth breathing is abnormal and can affect the whole stomatognathic system, body posture, etc. and not only the position of the teeth.\n\n【56】As soon as this problem is corrected, fewer consequences appear.\n\n【57】Different appliances could be used according to the age of the patient and his/her medical history, in order to establish a new neuromuscular pattern.\n\n【58】According to the etiology and the importance of the problem, removable, fixed, or a combination of both types of appliances can be used.\n\n【59】The orthodontist has the final decision.\n\n【60】The following examples will describe each option in detail.\n\n【61】This 6-year, 8-month-old patient is sent to the office by her family dentist in search of a second opinion regarding her anterior open bite.\n\n【62】An adenoidectomy was performed 4 months earlier. Nonetheless, mouth breathing and tongue thrusting continued. It was difficult for her to close and maintain the lips sealed. She used a pacifier until 4 years of age .\n删除3：<u>Fig. 3.1\n\n【63】( a , b ) Pretreatment photographs of a 6-year, 8-month-old girl with problems to keep her lips closed\n</u>\n<mark>Her profile was convex, and the nasolabial angle was reduced.</mark>\n\n【64】Even though she was only 6 years and 8 months of age, she had a double chin.\n\n【65】Hyperactivity of the musculature of the lips in combination with tongue thrust with abnormal tongue posture during speech was observed during the clinical examination.\n\n【66】The front photograph showed a significant open bite in the anterior region in combination with a midline deviation.

All day and night, the tongue was placed between the upper and lower incisors which were why they could not erupt normally.

The upper temporary second molar had been extracted 6 months earlier\n</u>\n<mark>The treatment objective (Phase I) was to normalize overbite and overjet, maintain Class I molar, control tongue thrust, improve the activity of the lips, and enhance her profile.</mark>\n\n【69】To achieve this objective, the use of a functional appliance is decided on. Of all the possible choices, a prefabricated functional appliance also known as Trainer System TM (Myofunctional Research Co. Australia) was chosen. It is fabricated with a special type of polyurethane and helps the correction and normalization of the muscular dysfunction.\n\n【70】The appliance is especially designed to stimulate anterior and lateral muscles and help to achieve normal nasal breathing. Since the material is soft, no major problems of adaptation are present .\n删除3：<u>Fig. 3.4\n\n【71】( a , b ) In order to achieve nasal breathing, a pre-orthodontic trainer was recommended.

It also helps to improve dental arch development during the early and late mixed dentition, and most importantly, this appliance helps normalize bad habits.\n\n【80】Also, other types of functional appliances can be used according to the orthodontist’s preferences. As always, correct diagnosis is more important than the type of the appliance used.\n\n【81】The comparison between the pre- and posttreatment front dental photographs showed evidence of the normalization of the anterior open bite and the parallelism between the occlusal and gingival planes.\n\n【82】No brackets were required to achieve the expected results.\n\n【83】Ideally an overcorrection of the overjet and overbite is highly recommended .\n\n【84】A 6-month control was recommended until all the second molars erupted.\n删除3：<u>Fig. 3.10\n\n【85】( a , b ) The comparison between the pre- and posttreatment front dental photographs showed normalization of the anterior open bite\n</u>\n<mark>Upon analyzing the lower third of the face and the nasolabial angle, a significant improvement was confirmed.

The retention protocol has to include a strict control of the position and function of the tongue.\n\n【88】This 9-year, 2-month-old patient was sent by her family dentist due to her significant midline deviation and slight Class III tendency.\n\n【89】Her profile was straight with a normal nasolabial angle.

Both metformin and dapagliflozin have low risk for hypoglycemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. One possible regimen is to test BG a few times a week at alternating times, such as fasting, before evening meal, and/or bedtime. Keep BG log; call if BG under 80 or over 200 mg/dL.\n\n【54】   Call if any new symptoms, such as dizziness; genitourinary infections; nausea or abdominal pain; weight change, such as rapid loss or gain of more than 5 pounds; increased swelling in legs, ankles, or feet.\n\n【55】   Discuss symptoms of DKA and when to seek care.

Return sooner or call if needed.\n\n【60】   Repeat hemoglobin A <sub>1c </sub> testing in 3 months. Continue routine monitoring of renal function and volume status as clinically indicated.\n\n【61】Referral considerations:\n\n【62】   A referral to cardiac rehabilitation professional may be considered for specific evaluation, recommendations, and rehabilitation sessions. An exercise specialist can also help with strategies to safely and effectively increase physical activity.\n\n【63】   A registered dietitian can be a valuable resource to plan and support implementation of appropriate dietary recommendations for HF and T2DM.\n\n【64】   Endocrinology can be a valuable resource when more complex insulin therapies are needed or a patient is not achieving glycemic goals.

Consider current research and recommendations—dapagliflozin and empagliflozin currently have HF indications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 26 \\]</u> and were recommended by the ACC’s 2021 expert consensus decision pathway for HF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 27 \\]</u>, in conjunction with a background of guideline-directed medial therapy (GDMT), for those with HFrEF (EF < 40%) with or without T2DM and NYHA class II–IV HF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 27 \\]</u>.\n\n【68】   Consider safety recommendations for SGLT-2i, such as potential genitourinary infections and risk of DKA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 22 \\]</u>.\n\n【69】   There is a risk of volume depletion and hypotension with SGLT-2 inhibitors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Providers should weigh renal cautions in the context of individual factors when an SGLT2i is prescribed for a patient with HF and consider close follow-up as appropriate. Patients can also monitor BP outpatient, keep logs, and notify the provider if new symptoms (such as lightheadedness or dizziness) develop, or BP drops below recommended parameters.\n\n【70】   Given the drug’s mechanism of action, an SGLT-2i can increase diuresis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Monitor for changes in fluid status, BP, renal function, and potassium. Diuretic adjustments should be patient-specific and followed with close monitoring.\n\n【71】   Be mindful of thirst mechanism in hyperglycemic state with T2DM, which can lead to increased fluid intake and subsequently causing volume overload and challenging fluid balance. This has been described as a common issue seen in HF patients with diabetes that is uncontrolled.\n\n【72】   Metformin can be continued for many patients with T2DM and stable HF, but it is important to consider cautions, such as risk factors for lactic acidosis, and ensure renal function is appropriate for use 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Avoid if unstable or acute heart failure or shock 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 29 \\]</u>, and it is not recommended for those with HF who are hospitalized 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【73】   The AHA/HFSA scientific statement noted carvedilol could be used preferentially if a patient with HFrEF has poor glycemic control, due to more favorable effects on glycemic control than metoprolol succinate and bisoprolol 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 13:58:55", "endTime": "2024/09/12 13:59:56", "cost": 60.733}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:29", "update_time": "2024-09-11 21:59:56", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 21:58:55"}

Varicella is a common childhood illness, characterized by fever, viremia, and scattered vesicular lesions of the skin. After the primary infection, the virus lies dormant in the nerves, including the cranial nerve ganglia, dorsal root ganglia, and autonomic ganglia. Herpes zoster is the result of reactivation of latent VZV. The disease most frequently occurs in older adults. It presents as painful, unilateral dermatomal, vesicular lesions on the erythematous background that do not cross the midline 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Crusts can be also presented. The most common locations are the thoracic nerves and the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve with possible eye involvement (keratitis, scarring, and vision loss). The major complication of herpes zoster is an post-herpetic neuralgia, defined as a pain persisting for more than 90 days after the resolution of the skin lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The diagnosis on herpes zoster is established based on the clinical picture. Polymerase chain reaction, direct fluorescent antigen testing or viral culture are rarely performed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Antiviral drugs (acyclovir, famciclovir, and valacyclovir) should be considered for all patients with herpes zoster and they are especially recommended for patients older than 50 years, those who have a moderate or severe pain or rash, and those with involvement of non-truncal dermatomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】Differential diagnoses for the presented patient included herpes gladiatorum, contact dermatitis and basal cell carcinoma.\n\n【27】Herpes gladiatorum is a skin infection caused by herpes simplex virus type 1. The disease is spread through direct skin-to-skin contact, thus it is more commonly observed in individuals who play sport with the close contact 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Clinically, herpes gladiatorum is characterized by the presence of cluster or clusters of clear, fluid-filled vesicles with surrounding erythema. Each body area can be affected. Pain may be reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The lesions can be multiple and are not limited to one dermatome. Fever and enlarged lymph nodes are rarely reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】Contact dermatitis is an inflammatory eczematous skin disease. The disease is rarely presented on the scalp area, because of the great thickness of the epidermis in this region. In the case of application of irritants or allergens on the scalp symptoms are usually observed on the face or neck. Clinically, contact dermatitis presents as an erythema with scaling and coexisted itch 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. In acute disease, vesicles or pustules may be presented 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】Basal cell carcinoma is the most common skin malignancy. The incidence rate of the disease increases with age. Basal cell carcinoma presents as a tiny, hardly visible papule, growing into a nodule or a plaque that is sometimes ulcerated. The face, scalp and neck are most commonly affected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】In the presented patient, based on the clinical manifestation the diagnosis of herpes zoster involving ophthalmic branch (V1) of the trigeminal nerve was established. She was treated with 500 mg intravenous acyclovir three times daily per 10 days and oral paracetamol in order to reduce pain. A complete resolution of skin lesions was observed.\n\n【31】Key Points\n\n【32】   Herpes zoster is a viral skin infection that may affect the scalp area.\n\n【33】   It is characterized by the presence of unilateral, dermatomal, painful vesicles and crusts with surrounding erythema.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 14:46:34", "endTime": "2024/09/12 14:47:10", "cost": 36.261}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:29", "update_time": "2024-09-11 22:47:09", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 22:46:32"}

Medical practitioners should suspect photosensitivity  删除换行 if skin disease affects exposed skin sites – classically the face, hands and anterior chest. \n\n【12】On direct questioning, patients may report a worsening of their skin condition during the  删除换行 summer or following a holiday abroad. \n\n【13】This patient was diagnosed with porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) which usually presents  删除换行 between the 3rd to 5th decades. The condition is characterized by skin fragility leading  删除换行 to blister formation following minor trauma. Initially, skin changes include tense vesi删除8：<u>￾</u>cles/bullae and erosions on a background of normal-looking skin. However, these heal  删除换行 to leave small atrophic scars and milia (inclusion cysts) as seen in this patient. Waxy删除8：<u>￾</u>looking plaques and hypertrichosis may also be seen. \n\n【14】Porphyrins are important in the formation of haemoglobin, myoglobin and cytochromes. \n\n【15】The porphyrias are diseases in which specific enzyme deficiencies lead to the accumu删除8：<u>￾</u>lation of intermediate metabolites in the porphyrin biosynthesis pathway. Porphyrins  删除换行 absorb light in the 400–405 nm range (the lower range of visible light). This absorbed  删除换行 light is then transferred to cellular structures, causing damage to tissues. Deficiency of  删除换行 the enzyme uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD) is responsible for PCT, which may  删除换行 be inherited or acquired. Patients with acquired disease are deficient in UROD in their  删除换行 liver and therefore express the disease phenotypically when triggered by agents such as  删除换行 alcohol, oestrogen and hepatitis C. Familial PCT is inherited in an autosomal dominant  删除换行 fashion with a resultant defect in the synthesis of UROD. \n\n【16】A skin biopsy reveals subepidermal bullae. Wood’s lamp examination of the urine shows  删除换行 orange red fluorescence. A porphyrin screen reveals raised uroporphyrin I in the urine  删除换行 and increased levels of isocoproporphyrins in the stool.\n\n【17】Treatments include eliminating possible trigger factors such as alcohol. Patients should  删除换行 be protected from both ultraviolet and visible light.

Case-detection testing for PA in a pregnant woman is the same as for nonpregnant patients： morning blood sample for the measure-ment of aldosterone and renin. The combination of suppressed renin and an aldosterone level>10 ng/dL is a positive case-detection test for PA. If sponta-neous hypokalemia is present in the woman with high plasma aldosterone concentration (≥20 ng/dL) and suppressed renin， confirmatory testing is not needed. In a normokalemic woman with a positive case-detection test， confirmatory testing should be pursued. However， the captopril stimulation test is contraindicated in pregnancy， and the saline infu-sion test may not be well tolerated. One option is measurement of sodium and aldosterone in a24-hour urine collection on an ambient sodium diet. Subtype testing with abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) without gadolinium is the test of choice. Computed tomography (CT) and adrenal venous sampling (AVS) should be avoided in pregnancy. In patients with vigorous PA who are less than 35 years old and have a clear-cut， unilat-eral adrenal adenoma on MRI， AVS is not needed. The type of treatment for PA in pregnancy depends on how difficult it is to manage the hypertension and hypokalemia. If the patient is in the subset of those who have a pregnancy-related remission in the degree of PA during pregnancy， then surgery or treatment with a mineralocorticoid receptor antag-onist (MRA) can be avoided until after delivery. However， if PA accelerates during pregnancy and 删除换行 hypertension and hypokalemia are marked， then sur-gical and/or targeted medical intervention with a MRA is indicated. Unilateral laparoscopic adrenalectomy during the second trimester can be considered in those women with confirmed PA and a clear-cut unilateral adrenal macroadenoma (>10 mm).\n\n【3】A 22-year-old woman (gravida 2， para 1) was initially seen elsewhere at 12 weeks of gestation for increas-ing weakness and fatigue. She was hypertensive and hypokalemic. The plasma aldosterone concentration was >20 ng/dL and the plasma renin activity was sup-pressed. She was treated with potassium chloride and spironolactone. Because of worsening hypertension(160/105 mmHg)， at 28 weeks of gestation she was referred to Mayo Clinic.\n\n【4】INVESTIGATIONS\n\n【5】Laboratorystudies at Mayo Clinic were diagnos-tic for PA. The plasma aldosterone concentration was 230 ng/dL (normal，<21 ng/dL) and the plasma renin activity was suppressed. An abdominal mag-netic resonance imaging (MRI) without gadolinium detected a 3.0×2.0×2.0-cm right adrenal mass with imaging characteristics consistent with an adenoma.\n\n【6】TREATMENT\n\n【7】Ireatment with spironolactone was discontinued. Despiteadditional antihypertensive medications， over the next 4 weeks she had worsening hyperten-sion (165/115mmHg) and proteinuria (24-hour urine protein was 4800 g). She subsequently underwent induction of labor at 32 weeks of gestation for super-imposed preeclampsia. She delivered a 1705-g male\n删除3：<u>Fig.100.1 Axial image from magnetic resonance imaging of the abdo- men without gadolinium completed at 28 weeks of gestation showed a 3.0×2.0×2.0-cm right adrenal mass (arrow).</u>\n\n【8】infant. Examination of the genitalia was normal. The infant required 15 days of neonatal intensive care for respiratory distress syndrome and nutritional sup-port. At 2 months postpartum the mother underwent right adrenalectomy without complication. Pathology showed a 2-cm benign adrenocortical adenoma con-sistent with an APA.\n\n【9】OUTCOME AND FOLLOW-UP\n\n【10】At 1 month after operation the plasma aldosterone concentration was <1 ng/dL. At last follow-up， 1 year later， she was normotensive and normokalemic. She did not require potassium supplementation or antihy-pertensive medications.\n\n【11】A unique feature of PA during pregnancy is that the degree of disease may be either improved or aggra-vated. In some women with PA， the high blood levels of pregnancy-related progesterone are antagonistic at the mineralocorticoid receptor and partially block the action of aldosterone； these patients have an improve-ment in the manifestations of PA during pregnancy.2.3In other pregnant women， increased expression of 删除换行 uteinizing choriogonadotropin receptor has been documented in APAs that harbor B-catenin mutations， and the degree of hyperaldosteronism is aggravated by the increased pregnancy-related blood levels of human chorionic gonadotropin.4.5\n\n【12】The optimal treatment for PA in pregnancy depends on how difficult it is to manage the hypertension and hypokalemia. If the patient is in the subset of patients who have a remission in the degree of PA， then surgery or treatment with a MRA can be avoided until after delivery. However， if hypertension and hypokalemia are marked， then surgical and/or medical intervention is indicated. Unilateral laparoscopic adrenalectomy during the second trimester can be considered in those women with confirmed PA and a clear-cut unilateral adrenal macroadenoma (>10mm).\n\n【13】Spironolactone crosses the placenta and is a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) pregnancy category C drug because feminization of newborn male rats has been documented. However， there is only one human case in the medical literature where treatment with spironolactone in pregnancy led to ambiguous genitalia in a male infant； this occurred in a woman treated with spironolactone for polycys-tic ovary syndrome prepregnancy and through the fifth week of gestation. Eplerenone is an FDA preg-nancy category B drug. Therefore， for those preg-nant women who will be managed medically， the hypertension should be treated with standard anti-hypertensive drugs approved for use during preg-nancy. Hypokalemia， if present， should be treated with oral potassium supplements. For those patients with refractory hypertension 2 and/or hypokale-mia， the addition of eplerenone may be cautiously considered.7.8\n\n【14】Key Points\n\n【15】●PA in the setting of pregnancy is a high-risk sce-nario for both mother and fetus. The most fre-quent complication is superimposed preeclamp-sia， which， in some cases，leads to preterm delivery(as occurred in the patient presented herein). The optimal way to prevent this difficult clinical sce-nario is a broader awareness of PA by clinicians and patients， which should lead to prepregnancy diagnosis and treatment. All woman with hyper-tension in their reproductive years should have 删除换行 case detection testing for PA-especially before starting a family.\n\n【16】Case detection testing for PA in pregnancy is the same as in nonpregnant women. However， capto-pril， CT， and AVS should be avoided.\n\n【17】● Patients with PA in the setting of pregnancy can be managed successfully with standard antihypertensive medications andpotassium supplementation. Another treatment option is laparoscopic adrenalectomy during the second trimester—assuming that a unilateral adrenal macroadenoma is identified on MRI. Treatment with spironolactone should be avoided.\n删除20：<u>1.Zelinka T， Petrak O， Rosa J， Holaj R， Strauch B， Widimsky J Jr. Primary aldosteronism and pregnancy Kidney Blood Press Res. 2020；45通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u>：275-285.\n\n【18】2 Campino C， Trejo P Carvajal CA， et al.

He had lost 23 pounds in the past year， but related that to poor intake due to injury to his jaw.\n\n【4】His past medical history was significant for being physically assaulted 1 year earlier， leading to a broken jaw that required wiring by an oral surgeon. He claimed poor oral intake as a result of that injury. He had been unaware of any other serious medical illness until recently. He had no previous pneumonia， meningitis， diarrhea， or other systemic complaints. However， a few days before this admission， he had been told at the previous hospital that his HIV test was positive.\n\n【5】He was homosexual， with many previous sex partners over the years. He lived in a big cosmopolitan southern city in the 1980s， and only recently came home a few years ago. A former hotel help， he was currently unemployed. He was the middle child of a large family of seven children. He was not married， and had no children. He smoked half a pack of cigarettes a day for the past 20 years， and admitted to heavy alcohol intake (liquor and beer).\n\n【6】He was on no regular medications， and had no known drug allergies.\n\n【7】On 5/26/00， 1 day after admission， infectious diseases consult was sought to help address the cystic brain lesions in a patient with HIV infection.\n\n【8】Before my examination on 5/26/00， the patient had just had neurosurgery， a right posterior frontal burr hole with insertion of an external ventriculostomy catheter， designed to protect him against hydrocephalus， as well as to obtain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for studies.\n\n【9】On examination on 5/26/00， he was alert and oriented to place， but not to time and dates.\n\n【10】Vital signs showed the following： BP 158/98， RR 14， HR 74， temperature97.7°F (Tmax 100°F)； height 5'9\"， and weight 146 pounds.\n\n【11】Head and neck exam showed a ventriculostomy drain in place， extensive oropharyngeal thrush， and generally poor dentition. The heart，lung， and abdom-inal exams were negative. The upper and lower extremities were unremarkable， and the skin showed no rash. External genital exam showed a normal uncir-cumcised male. Lymph nodes were palpable in the groin， shotty， multiple， and non-tender in the axilla， with smaller nodes noted in the right supraclavicular and epitrochlear areas. The neurologic exam found him to be awake and able to move all extremities； he had prompt deep tendon reflexes. Gait was not tested.\n\n【12】Chest x-ray showed patchy infiltrates in the right upper and left lower lobes. The CT scan and MRI of the brain done at the outside hospital on 5/20/00 showed multiple ring-enhancing lesions， one in the cerebellum， two or more in the right temporal lobe， and one in the left hemisphere. The largest lesion was in the cerebellum.\n\n【13】HIV serology was positive， but confirmatory Western blot test， CD4 count，and viral load were pending. CBC showed a WBC count of 7.4， H/H 11.1 and 32.0， respectively， MCV 101.6， and platelet count 278，000. Differential count showed90% polymorphs， 1% band， 5% lymphs， and 4% monocytes. Sodium was 133， potassium 3.9， BUN and creatinine were 8 and 0.6 mg/dL， respectively. The liver tests showed the following： SGOT 82， SGPT 54 (normal)， alkaline phosphatase623， total bilirubin 1.23， albumin 3.1， and total protein 8.3. Cholesterol and triglyceride levels were within normal limits. Thyroid function tests (T3 uptake and T4) were normal. Electrocardiogram (EKG) was normal sinus rhythm， with sinus arrhythmia.\n\n【14】·What is your presumptive diagnosis at this time?\n\n【15】Hospital course\n\n【16】At surgery on 5/26/00， CSF fluid was obtained during placement of the ventricu-lostomy tube. It showed no WBCs， nine RBCs， normal glucose of 78 mg/dL， and protein of less than 10. Cryptococcal antigen test was negative. Additional studies included negative CSF VDRL test for syphilis. The CSF culture was negative.\n\n【17】One of the differential diagnoses considered to explain the multiple ring-enhancing brain lesions was toxoplasmosis. Serology for toxoplasma was， however， negative for IgG， IgM， and IgA antibodies. The patient was started on presumptive treatment for CNS toxoplasmosis， plus steroid therapy.\n\n【18】Over the next several days， he slowly developed increasing signs of obstruc-tive hydrocephalus with lethargy， probably related to the cerebellar lesions. Serial CT scans and MRI suggested significant mass effect on the fourth ventricle， and reconfirmed multiple ring-enhancing lesions scattered in the cerebral hemispheres and cerebellum.\n\n【19】The previous CSF stains and cultures of 5/26/00 were still negative for bacte-ria， fungi， and acid-fast bacilli (AFB).\n\n【20】· Have you changed or modified your differential diagnoses based on this new develop-ment?\n\n【21】The patient was taken back to surgery on 6/7/00. A left posterior fossa craniec-tomy was done to reach the left cerebellar hemisphere. Four large abscesses with thick walls were encountered and evacuated. The pus was yellow brown， and did not have any detectable odor.\n\n【22】· What do you expect the pus would show?\n\n【23】The initial gram stain， KOH， and AFB stains of the brain abscess were negative. At 48 hours， however， an early growth was noted on the aerobic blood agar (BA) 删除换行 plate. The organism grew also on the TB culture medium (L J medium)， but not on the fungal culture medium (SDA).\n\n【24】The BA plate with growth of the organism will be shown later.\n\n【25】The preliminary report at 2 days was I+ filamentous gram-positive rods. Several days later， additional stains and tests could be done with more growth of the organism. The gram stain showed beaded， filamentous gram-positive rods while the modified acid-fast stain showed weakly， partial acid-fast filamentous rods. The organism was catalase positive and urea positive. Hydrolysis of casein and tyrosine was negative while xanthine hydrolysis was positive.\n\n【26】Additional tests performed by the laboratory later included confirmation of negative \"equi factor\" test (ruling out Rhodococcus equi) and antimicrobial sensitiv-ity to vancomycin (34 mm disk)， and resistance to erythromycin and gentamicin.\n\n【27】A non-standardized Kirby-Bauer (KB) antimicrobial susceptibility test for this organism was done， to help us tailor our treatment of the brain abscess. The organism showed sensitivity (by this KB test) to the following antimicrobial agents： trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole， imipenem， ciprofloxacin， ceftriaxone， cefotaxime， amikacin， and vancomycin. Resistance was noted for the following agents： ampicillin， erythromycin， and gentamicin.\n\n【28】The patient was placed on high-dose intravenous trimethoprim/sulfamethox-azole (TMP-SMX)， and eventually discharged on oral TMP-SMX on 6/20/00， to complete a planned prolonged therapy. Specific antiretroviral therapy was also to be started in the outpatient setting.\n\n【29】· What is your new or revised diagnosis basedon these laboratory findings， andthe clinical decisions regarding the choice of therapy?\n\n【30】Second admission (readmission) several months later\n\n【31】The patient was lost to follow-up after the last discharge from the hospital on6/20/00.\n\n【32】He returned to the hospital on 2/10/01， 7.5 months after discharge. This time， he complained of a 3-4-week history of nausea， generalized malaise， cough with productive and purulent sputum， and sometimes vomiting， especially post-prandial. He also had headache and left-sided chest pain. He had not been on antiretroviral medications， even though Medicaid had been approved for him a few months earlier. He had only learned about that fact recently. He had gained weight after being discharged in June， 2000， but had lost weight recently.\n\n【33】Two weeks earlier， he had been seen in the ER for “bronchitis\" when he presented with cough and malaise. Fever and chills were prominent， with a tem-perature elevation up to 102 °F noted at home. Diarrhea had developed several days prior to admission (frequent， small， watery， dark stools). He complained of burning pain down his legs and feet on and off. In spite of a good appetite， he had lost 20 pounds in the last 4-5 weeks. He said he had quit smoking and drinking in the last weeks or months.\n\n【34】Following the first admission of 5/25-6/20/00， he had taken the prescribed TMP-SMX faithfully for 6 weeks. He then developed a severe generalized pruritic rash (exfoliative dermatitis)， and so stopped the medication. He apparently was not on any alternative drug therapy for the previous brain abscess infection.\n\n【35】The patient haddeveloped a new drug allergy to TMP-SMX (as indicated)，and to soma (unclear symptoms).\n\n【36】On2/11/01， 1 day after readmission， infectious diseasesSCconsulttWas requested to address pneumonia and HIV infection in this patient.\n\n【37】On examination， he was alert and oriented， and in no acute distress. He had productive cough with yellowish brown sputum. His vital signs were as follows：BP 115/58， RR 22/min， HR 121， temperature 99°F； height 5'9\"， and weight133.7 pounds. His head showed healed scalp scars， the mouth showed no thrush. Heart， lung， and abdomen were unremarkable on exam while the extremities were negative except for dry skin on the feet with peeling and athlete’s foot. Lymph nodes were palpable but not enlarged in the neck， axilla， or groins. The neurologic exam showed him to be talkative and friendly； he had no focal find-ings.\n\n【38】The chest x-ray on admission showed bilateral pulmonary opacities in the right middle lobe， around the right hilum， as well as in the left upper medi-astinum. There was no pleural effusion. This x-ray was clearly worse than the clear chest x-ray noted on 6/7/00， at the time of surgery for the brain abscess.CT scan of the chest done 2 days later on 2/12/01 confirmed dense consolidations， with cavitary disease noted in the left upper， right lower， and right middle lobes of the lung. Splenomegaly was also noted in the CT scan as an incidental finding. On the same day， MRI of the brain with contrast showed a focus of encephalo-malacia within the left cerebellar hemisphere， likely representing an operative defect. No masses or other pathologic enhancements were noted. Generalized cortical atrophy was noted.\n\n【39】Blood cultures were negative. Chemistries showed a sodium value of 131， potassium 4.1， glucose 130 mg/dL， and BUN/creatinine 27/1.1， respectively. Liver panel showed SGOT 103， SGPT 45， alkaline phosphatase 128， albumin 3.1， total protein 8.1， and normal total bilirubin 1.09. The CBC showed a WBC count of 5.9， H/H of 5.7/16.5， respectively， MCV 93.2， and platelet count 353，000. The differential count showed 86% polymorphs， 8% lymphocytes， and 6%monocytes. Arterial blood gases (ABG) showed a pH of 7.49， pCO， 31.3，pO85， and O， saturation of 97% on room air.\n\n【40】Second hospital course\n\n【41】The working diagnosis was bilateral consolidating and cavitary pneumonia in an immune-compromised patient. The brain MRI suggested that the brain abscess was controlled， in spite of the patient having stopped treatment prematurely， on account of adverse drug reaction. Sputum stains and cultures were obtained.\n\n【42】While awaiting the sputum and blood culture results， empiric therapy was initiated to cover the likely organisms of pneumonia in this patient. Specific spu-tum culture was requested for Nocardia. Pneumocystis jiroveci stain was negative， as well as tests for M. tuberculosis. The patient had been started on a non-sulfa drug regimen， to provide coverage for PCP and bacterial pneumonia (clindamycin，lev-ofloxacin， and primaquine). The clinical picture and chest x-ray findings were not typical for PCP. Adjustments in the antimicrobial regimen were made on2/12/01， to provide coverage for the organism previously cultured from the brain abscess， as well as other bacterial causes of pneumonia. The patient was placed on ceftriaxone and imipenem.\n\n【43】The sputum gram stain suggested the presence of filamentous gram-positive rods， among other mouth flora. However， a few days later， the sputum cul-ture was reported positive for dry， chalky， crumbly or sticky colonies on the BA plate. The sputum culture shown in Fig. 10.2a is similar to that from the brain abscess noted in June， 2000. The gram stain from this growth showed beaded fil-amentous gram-positive rods. This was similar in appearance to the brain abscess culture of 6/7/00.\n\n【44】A presumptive diagnosis of Nocardia pneumonia was made. Disseminated dis-ease was suspected， although we did not document any site as positive other than the previous brain abscess. Intravenous ceftriaxone was continued， along with imipenem. The CD4 count was low at 52， and HIV-1 viral load was reported to be 13，266 copies /mL.\n\n【45】An in-house non-standardized KB susceptibility test for Nocardia this time showed a difference in the sensitivity pattern from June， 2000. This time， the organism was sensitive to tetracycline， imipenem， and ceftriaxone but resistant to TMP-SMX， ciprofloxacin， aztreonam， and ampicillin.\n\n【46】The patient improved in his general well-being while on treatment with intra-venous ceftriaxone and imipenem， with reduction in cough symptoms. The fever， related to left forearm phlebitis， resolved. He was anxious to go home. At dis-charge home 16 days later on 2/26/01， he was placed on minocycline for a planned 6 months therapy， with outpatient follow-up. He was expected to begin antiretroviral therapy during the outpatient follow-up.\n删除3：<u>Figure 10.2a Aerobic BA plate： chalky white， crumbly or sticky colonies， more than 1 week old. </u>\n\n【47】·What is the unifying diagnosis in this patient?\n\n【48】· What is the likely prognosis with and without specific therapy?\n\n【49】·What was the organism cultured from the brain abscess and later from the sputum?", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 11:55:51", "endTime": "2024/09/12 11:56:25", "cost": 33.38}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:29", "update_time": "2024-09-11 19:56:25", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 19:55:51"}

Since then the colony had lost three rats. An older female and her 1 <sup>1 </sup> /2-year-old son suddenly died 2 days after the move and a third adult male died a day later.

The 2-year-old intact naked male rat that was presented with partial anorexia and diarrhea.﻿</u>\n\n【6】Physical Examination Findings\n\n【7】This male rat was bright, alert, and responsive on physical examination. He tended to hold his left eye closed. The conjunctiva of his left eye was reddened, and a large piece of debris (presumed to be bedding material) was found lodged under the lower lid. The debris was removed and the cornea of the left eye was stained and revealed no evidence of corneal ulceration. This rat was accompanied by two other rats, both of which were also suffering with partial anorexia and diarrhea. A fecal sample was obtained for examination as a wet mount preparation under the microscope .﻿\n\n【8】Interpretive Discussion\n\n【9】The entire colony of rats is suffering with diarrhea and partial anorexia. Figure 31.2 reveals the appearance of the abnormal feces. A wet mount preparation of the feces revealed numerous highly motile piriform-shaped flagellate protozoa with an undulating membrane . A stained fecal smear  reveals oval to piriform-shaped cells with an eccentric nucleus and prominent rigid, curved structure seemingly associated with the nucleus in the cytoplasm. This is the typical appearance of trichomonads in stained smears. The drying of the slide and staining process distort the protozoa; however, structures associated with them often provide clues to their identity. For example, they can be identified as poorly staining or lightly staining cells (in most preparations) with a small pyknotic eccentric nucleus, an axostyle (the pale rigid structure in the figures), an undulating membrane (not seen in the figures), and thin eosinophilic flagella 通用删除1(英):<u>(not seen in Figs. 31.4a and 31.4b , but can be seen in the slightly out of focus image of Fig. 31.5 )</u> with Romanowsky-stained specimens.\n删除3：<u>Fig. 31.2 .

A moisturizing cream was applied daily to the skin of the rat to combat the dry skin that often affects animals that have recently moved from a humid environment to an arid or semiarid one. One drop of a triple antibiotic solution containing a corticosteroid was applied in the left eye twice daily for 10 days to treat the conjunctivitis. After 5 days, the trichomonad infection was completely eliminated in all the rats and they no longer had diarrhea.

Secondary hyperparathyroidism occurs in patients with early renal disease when due to hyperphosphatemia， hypocalcemia， and impaired production of1，25-dihydroxyvitamin D by the failing kidneys，PTH levels increase abnor-mally， causing in turn elevated levels of calcium. In this disorder therefore you would see increased PTH and increased calcium， signaling a disruption ofthe normal feedback cycle.\n\n【23】17.2 D. This patient has symptomatic hypercalcemia. He has an inappropriately normal PTH level， which should be suppressed with this degree of hyper-calcemia. The next step is to measure a 24-hour urinary calcium excretion to determine if this condition represents primary hyperparathyroidism (most common) or familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (rare).\n\n【24】17.3(C. This is a common presentation of SIADH due to pneumonia. This patient is euvolemic， so aggressive rehydration is not necessary. Treatment of the underlying pneumonia is key， so antibiotics must be given. With a sodium level of 130 mg/dL， the use of 3% saline is not necessary. The electrolyte abnormality should correct with treatment of the pneumonia and with fluid restriction.\n\n【25】17.4IE. This pat ient has hyperkalemia with cardiac changes—an acute， life-threatening condition.

It was completely asymptomatic. On close cutaneous examination, there was a central black papule on left upper region of neck, of size 0.7 cm in diameter with regular border. It was surrounded by a complete depigmented halo which was oval and regular in shape and about 3 cm in its maximum dimension . No personal or family history of similar lesion was noted.

It tends to be multiple in number and usually affects individuals in second decade of life with no gender or racial predilection. The commonest site is upper back followed by neck and abdomen. The central nevus may partially or completely regress in years with or without repigmentation of halo 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】The development of halo is thought to result from host’s immunologic reactions, chiefly consisting of inflammatory cytokines and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The finding of elevated circulating antibodies against melanocytic antigens is only secondary to the destruction of melanocytes.\n\n【22】The typical halo nevus presents as solitary or multiple, darkly pigmented, benign compound melanocytic nevus with a surrounding symmetric, well-defined, rim of depigmented zone. The central papule as well as peripheral halo, both have regular borders. In white skin, it is more appreciable during the summer months showing the non-tanned halo in sharp contrast to the normal skin. The diameter of the halo is correlated to the size of the central nevus, the larger the nevus, the larger the halo. Halo nevi are also associated with vitiligo and a vitiligo-like phenomenon. Approximately 20% of individuals with halo nevi have vitiligo.\n\n【23】Histopathologically, the nevus may be junctional, compound or dermal, with dense lymphocytic infiltrates surrounding or permeating the dermal component. The nevus cells may become vacuolated with pyknotic nuclei 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The use of DOPA stains usually reveal a loss of epidermal melanocytes in the halo area. The peripheral white halo has little or no lymphocytic infiltrate. Regression of the central nevus is not associated with fibrosis, in contrast to the regression of melanoma, due to increased levels of antifibrotic tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α.\n\n【24】Mayerson’s nevus, cockade nevus and regressing melanoma are usually included in close differential diagnosis of halo nevus.\n\n【25】Mayerson’s nevus : It is clinically presented by a melanocytic nevus developing surrounding eczematous inflammatory reaction associated with epidermal scaling and pruritus. It is usually solitary, but can be multiple and nearly three times as common in males compared to females. The trunk is the most common site, although any site can be affected. Unlike in halo nevus, Meyerson’s nevus does not regress. The histopathology is usually that of an acquired melanocytic nevus with associated spongiotic dermal dermatitis predominated by CD4+ T-lymphocytes that miss other markers of T helper cells such as BCL-6 or CD10 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】Cockade nevus : It is a rare variant of acquired melanocytic nevus that peculiarly presents as a target-like nevi, resembling a rosette 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. There is a hypochromic zone between pigmented central junctional melanocytic nevus and pigmented halo, giving it a target-like configuration. These are usually multiple in number and affect young people. Spinal dysraphism and juvenile diabetes mellitus are its known associations. On histopathology, it does not show cellular infiltrates unlike in halo nevus.\n\n【27】Melanoma : Being an immunogenic tumor and infiltrated by high levels of T lymphocytes, the course of melanoma may witness spontaneous regression with pigmentary changes. It may be clinically evident as depigmentation either within a melanocytic lesion, around melanocytic nevi (halo nevi) or in a distant site (melanoma-associated depigmentation) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Of these, ‘melanoma with a depigmented halo’ simulate the picture of benign halo nevus. Of note, the halo of melanoma is more irregular than that seen in halo nevus and the patients are usually older. To add, histopathology of melanoma with halo during regression reveals fibrous stroma replacing the dermal portion of the tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】Excisional biopsy is the best recommendation to rule out the possibility of malignancy. However, it can be left keeping under observation.\n\n【29】### Key Points\n\n【30】   Halo nevus presents as darkly pigmented melanocytic nevus with a surrounding well-defined rim of depigmented skin.\n\n【31】   The central nevus may partially or completely regress in years with or without repigmentation of halo.\n\n【32】   Regression of the central nevus is not associated with fibrosis unlike in melanoma .\n\n【33】###", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 14:22:36", "endTime": "2024/09/12 14:23:04", "cost": 28.273}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:29", "update_time": "2024-09-11 22:23:03", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 22:22:35"}

Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy reveals an annular mass with ulceration in the lower third of his esophageal wall, similar to the gross specimen depicted in the image. Histologic examination reveals increased mitosis, dysplasia, and nuclear atypia of glandular columnar epithelial cells.

The specimen from this patient indicates adenocarcinoma, which typically develops in the lower third of the esophagus near the gastric cardia. Chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease leads to Barrett esophagus, metaplasia of the squamous epithelium of the distal esophagus to columnar epithelium as a result of chronic acid exposure. Obesity increases the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma by exacerbating reflux esophagitis. Other risk factors include known Barrett esophagus, tobacco use, and prior radiation therapy.  \n\n【6】Answer A is incorrect . Achalasia is caused by esophageal hypomotility and defective relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter, leading to dysphagia, chest pain, and regurgitation of food. It is associated with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus, most likely as a result of chronic irritation from food abnormally retained in the esophagus.  \n\n【7】Answer B is incorrect . The other common variant of esophageal cancer is squamous cell carcinoma. It presents similarly to adenocarcinoma with dysphagia, odynophagia, and weight loss, but is differentiated on the basis of histology and location of focus in the esophagus (the upper to middle third). Whereas adenocarcinoma of the esophagus is more common in white men, squamous cell carcinoma is typically found in African-American men. The higher incidence is most likely due to poverty and increased rates of alcohol and tobacco use.  \n\n【8】Answer C is incorrect . Both types of esophageal cancer are more common in male patients. Squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus is four times more common, and adenocarcinoma seven times more common, in men than in women.  \n\n【9】Answer E is incorrect .

However, the aetiology is not immediately obvious. He presents with  删除换行 a fever and raised inflammatory markers with a prodromal illness. Apart from hyperten删除8：<u>￾</u>sion he has no risk factors for ischaemic heart disease. These symptoms fit best with myo删除8：<u>￾</u>carditis. Myocarditis is uncommon, but tends to affect young adults. Acute myocarditis  删除换行 can present mildly, as in this case, or in extremis with cardiogenic shock or sudden death. \n\n【31】The causes of myocarditis include infections (viral being the most common – parvovirus \n\n【32】B-19, adenovirus, coxsackie B, human herpes virus-6, cytomegalovirus, Epstein–Barr  删除换行 virus, herpes simplex, HIV), autoimmune diseases (e.g. systemic lupus erythematosus,  删除换行 rheumatoid arthritis) and drug-induced (anthracyclines).\n\n【33】He is haemodynamically stable and there is no evidence of heart failure. An echocar删除8：<u>￾</u>diogram will determine whether there is any left ventricular functional impairment and  删除换行 determine any regional wall motion abnormalities. He may well have inferior wall motion  删除换行 abnormalities as the ECG suggested some inferior changes. An echocardiogram will also  删除换行 identify an associated pericardial effusion. In view of the ST changes inferiorly on ECG \n\n【34】and raised troponin, a coronary angiogram will need to be performed to ensure normal  删除换行 coronary anatomy. A sensitive and specific test to help confirm the diagnosis of myocar删除8：<u>￾</u>ditis is an MRI with gadolinium enhancement. Typically parts of myocardium with late  删除换行 gadolinium enhancement identify areas of inflammation. The pattern of inflammation  删除换行 can help determine the type of myocarditis.

Cromolyn is given by aerosol for the prophylactic treatment of asthma. The mechanism of action involves stabilization of mast cells and thus a decrease in the release of mediators (eg, leukotrienes and histamine) responsible for bronchoconstriction. These drugs are insoluble and thus have only local effects. They are used only in the prophylaxis of acute asthma, not during an attack.  \n\n【7】Answer B is incorrect . Epinephrine is an acceptable treatment and is often the drug of choice for a severe acute asthma attack. This autonomic activator relaxes smooth muscle, facilitating breathing during an acute attack.  \n\n【8】Answer C is incorrect . Ipratropium is an acceptable treatment for an acute asthma attack. It works as a competitive blocker of muscarinic receptors, preventing bronchoconstriction.  \n\n【9】Answer D is incorrect . Terbutaline is an acceptable treatment for an acute asthma attack. This drug relaxes bronchial smooth muscle.  \n\n【10】Answer E is incorrect . Theophylline is an acceptable treatment for an acute asthma attack.

Coronary artery was not examined at that time.\n\n【2】She presented on Day 8 of illness with a history of cough and fever for 4 days and coronary artery dilation for 7 days. Eight days ago, she had fever up to 38.6 °C, twice a day, with paroxysmal cough, sigh, and fatigue. She was treated with antiviral, antitussive medications for 4 days. Her fever and cough regressed. Seven days ago, she came to our clinic. Echo showed LCA dilation. She was admitted to our pediatric cardiology ward. Since the onset, her mental state, diet, and sleep were normal, as well as her activities. Examination revealed afebrile (T 36.9 °C), and breathing smoothly (PR 98 bpm, RR 20 bpm, BP 106/62 mmHg). Her weight was 20 kg. Cervical lymphadenectasis was detected, along with congested pharynx and tonsil. Liver was enlarged 2 cm below right costal margin, medium hard. Others were normal.

Six days ago, echo showed LAD dilated about 3.6 mm–5.4 mm , while RCA , LVED , and LVEF  were normal. Five days before admission, WBC 3.4 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, NE 1.42 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, HGB 117 g/L, PLT 134 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L.

The main pathological change is systemic small vasculitis, coronary artery dilatation in about 1/5 of untreated patients, and likely thrombosis formed by myocardial infarction within 2 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. After 2 years of medication, most can be recovered. But about 5% of patients, even with IVIG treatment, still have CAA after 15 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】2.  2.\n\n【21】    Since the Japanese doctor Kawasaki Fusuke’s report in 1967, more pediatricians have recognized KD. But here are still misdiagnosed cases. Fortunately, for this girl, a coronary aneurysm was discovered without ischemic cardiomyopathy developed, and anticoagulant was applied timely. If there is neither coronary thrombosis formed nor ischemic cardiomyopathy developed, patients can undergo coronary artery bypass surgery when they grow up. The long-term prognosis is optimistic. But for cases with coronary aneurysm developed for 3–4 year, it is less likely for heart to return normal.\n\n【22】3.  3.\n\n【23】    In our center, for patients whose KD diagnosis was delayed, those with CAA on the right have better prognosis than those with CAA on the left . Furthermore, prognosis in patients with delayed diagnosis is better than in patients with misdiagnosis. Even patients miss the best window to receive IVIG, they can take oral aspirin to prevent coronary thrombosis. If patients have developed giant CAA, they need to take oral warfarin to prevent the thrombus formed in CAA . But eventually, the majority of these patients have small amount of thrombus adhering to the inner wall of CAA, and gradually develop into irreversible calcification in CAA wall (case 4 and case 7). If misdiagnosed patients were admitted due to other symptoms, they would have better prognosis than those admitted due to heart failure symptoms . Thus, as long as heart failure does not occur, prognosis in KD patients is generally good.\n\n【24】Ya-li Zhang\n\n【25】12.3 Case 44 Misdiagnosed KD with Giant CAA, LCA Thrombus, and Chronic Heart Failure\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【26】A 3-year-old boy presented with a past medical history of prolonged fever over 10 days, along with red eyes, cervical lymphadenopathy, dry and red lips about 6 months ago, without rashes and desquamation around fingernails or toenails. He had unremarkable allergy and no family history.\n\n【27】He presented with an interrupt cough for nearly 20 days, fever for 2 days, along with stomachache for 6 days. On the second day of admission, he was diagnosed with pneumonia and was given infusion of second-generation cephalosporin for 1 week in a local hospital. His cough regressed. On Day 12, chest DR showed heart enlargement. On Day 14, he developed paroxysmal stomachache around navel. On Day 18, his cough got serious. Chest CT scan showed poor local inflation in bilateral inferior lobes, interstitial edema, right pleural effusion, pericardium effusion. Echo showed RCA aneurysm dilation, LCA dilation, heart enlargement, weak left ventricular wall motion, mitral and tricuspid regurgitation (moderate), pericardial effusion (mild). LVEF was decreased. He was admitted in our pediatric cardiology ward as a patient with CAA and heart failure. He had paroxysmal cough along with fatigue, sweaty, lack of appetite since the onset. Examination revealed he was afebrile, irritable, tachypnea (RR 40 bpm). Auscultation in lungs was normal. He had enhanced heart apex beats, weak heart sounds, and tachycardia (HR 138 bpm), with mild murmur at apex of the heart. Liver was enlarged 5 cm below right costal margin, moderate hard. Others were normal. Investigation revealed enlarged heart in chest DR  on Day 12 CBC results were shown in Table 12.1 . On Day 18, CK 254 U/L, CK-MB 33 U/L, total 25-OH vitamin D was 23.79 ng/mL; CRP, ASO, RF, serum ions, and urine were normal. On Day 20, chest CT showed local dilatation of the lower lobe and possible interstitial edema , right pleural effusion, pericardial effusion . Echo showed LVED 46 mm, LVEF 45% , RCA dilated about 8.4 mm, LAD dilated about 5.3 mm , left ventricular wall moved weakly, mitral and tricuspid regurgitation (moderate) , pericardial effusion (mild) . Overall systolic function of left ventricle was reduced. Admission blood test was summarized in Table 12.1 . CK-MB mass, cTnI, blood gas ion analysis, CRP, D-dimer, and INR were normal. PT was 16.3s. ECG showed low-flat and inverted T wave and the enlarged left atrium . He had acute episode of chronic heart failure. He was monitored for ECG, BP, blood oxygen, and was advised bed rest. He was treated with cedilanid 0.03 mg/kg, fast saturated in 24 h, IV furosemidum 1 mg/kg/day, oral spironolactone in 1 mg/kg/day, qd, 4 days of every week, oral captopril 1 mg/kg in two divided doses. Considering his previous medical history, he was diagnosed with KD at recovered stage, and he was given oral aspirin and dipyridamole 3–5 mg/kg/day.\n删除3：<u>Fig. 12.9\n\n【28】On Day 12 of admission, chest DR showed left side of the heart was significant enlarged\n</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 14:22:03", "endTime": "2024/09/12 14:22:52", "cost": 49.924}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:29", "update_time": "2024-09-11 22:22:53", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 22:22:02"}

She is taking a thiazide diuretic for mild hypertension. Her blood pressure is mildly elevated. The mammogram reveals a small cluster of calcifications around a small mass， which is one of the classic findings of breast cancer. With this mammo-graphic finding， it is of paramount importance to obtain tissue for histologic diag-nosis. Because of the high risk of malignancy， a stereotactic-directed core biopsy is indicated.\n\n【14】APPROACHTO：\n\n【15】The Abnormal Mammogram\n\n【16】DEFINITIONS\n\n【17】SUSPICIOUS MAMMOGRAPHICFINDINGS： A small cluster of calcifications， or masses with ill-defined borders.\n\n【18】NEEDLE LOCALIZATION： Procedure in which a sterile wire is placed via mam-mographic guidance such that the end of the wire is placed in the center of the suspicious area. The surgeon uses this guide to assist in excising breast tissue.\n\n【19】STEREOTACTIC CORE BIOPSY： Procedure in which the patient is prone on the mammographic table and biopsies are taken as directed with computer-assisted techniques.\n\n【20】CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【21】Although a clinical history and proper clinical breast examinations are important in detecting breast cancer， mammography remains the best method of detecting breast cancer at an early stage.\n\n【22】A mammogram is an x-ray of the breast tissue. Current radiation levels from mammography have been shown to be safe and cause no increased risk in develop-ing breast cancer. The radiation exposure is <10 rad per lifetime if annual mam-mograms begin at age 40 years and continue up to age 90. Both false positives and false negatives of up to 10% have been noted. Hence， a palpable breast mass in the face of a normal mammogram still requires a biopsy. Breast implants can diminish the accuracy of a mammogram， particularly if the implants are in front of the chest muscles. Magnetic resonance imaging has recently been shown to be effective in screening for breast cancer， particularly in younger patients and those at risk for breast cancer such as due to BRCA mutation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may identify early breast cancers missed by mammography.\n\n【23】Mammographic findings strongly suggestive of breast cancer include a mass， often with spiculated and invasive borders， or an architectural distortion， or an asymmetric increased tissue density when compared with prior studies or a corresponding area in the opposite breast . An isolated cluster of irregular calcifications， especially if linear and wispy， is an important sign of breast cancer.\n删除14：<u>A B</u>删除3：<u>Figure 48-1. Mammogram showing spiculated mass.

This method employs a computerized， digital， three-dimensional view of the breast and allows the physician to direct the needle to the biopsy site. The procedure carries a 2% to 4%“miss rate.Needle-localization biopsies employ multiple mammographic views of the breast and allow the surgeon to localize the lesion for evaluation. The latter procedure is more time-consuming， carries a comparable 3%to 5% miss rate， but excises more tissue， which is helpful in“borderline\"histologic conditions， such as ductal carcinoma-in-situ.\n\n【25】As compared to conventional film mammography， digital mammography has a slightly higher sensitivity for women less than age 50， premenopausal women，and those with dense breasts. However，outside of those categories， film mammography and digital mammography have similar accuracy.\n\n【26】CASE CORRELATION\n删除25：<u>See also Case 46 (Fibroadenoma) and Case 47 (Dominant Breast Mass).

They claim that many morally important qualities, such as rationality, exist in some intelligent animals. Singer and Cavaileri hold that apes display many fragments of the forms of rationality that we find in humans.通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>11 </sup></u> Moreover, some human beings lack rationality and the corresponding ability to morally evaluate their reasons for acting. Human infants are potentially, but not actually, rational; permanently unconscious human beings lack rationality altogether; and humans with certain forms of dementia or mental retardation may possess only fragments of rationality. In all of these cases, human beings cannot be what Korsgaard calls “sources of normativity.” Many moderates and liberals conclude that, if rationality in some form is a necessary and sufficient condition for personhood, then at least some humans are not persons, and at least some animals are persons.\n\n【2】If personhood and humanity are not coextensive, this creates an opportunity to explore the possibility that animals possess a right to life – the position favored by liberals. One way this position is defended is to underscore the idea that there is no criterion that all humans possess and all animals lack that is a necessary requirement for personhood. Tom Regan, for example, states the general argument in support of a conservative stance looks like this:\n\n【3】###### The conservative argument\n\n【4】通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> For X to be a person, X must have A.\n\n【5】通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> Humans have A.\n\n【6】通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> Animals do not have A.\n\n【7】通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> Therefore, humans are persons and animals are not.删除5：<u>通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>12</sup></u></u>\nRegan rebuts the conservative argument by showing that there is no quality, A, that can be used in the premises of this argument to establish the argument’s conclusion. For example, suppose the conservative proposes that the quality most essential for personhood is sentience. Regan’s reply would be that some humans, such as those in a persistent vegetative state, lack sentience, while many animals have it. Or, suppose a conservative proposes instead that possessing a concept of self is essential for personhood. Regan’s reply would be to call attention to the fact that this quality is inadequate, since some human beings, such as infants and those with profound mental retardation, lack a concept of self. Likewise, if the quality considered fundamental to personhood is possession of positive interests, such as desires, goals, hopes, and preferences, Regan would point out that there are humans who lack these qualities and animals who have them.\n\n【8】Regan concludes that at least some animals satisfy whatever criterion one might advance as a necessary condition for personhood, and at least some human beings fail to satisfy it. In other words, there is no A which is non-arbitrary and such that all humans possess A and no animals possess A. Therefore, it is inconsistent to believe that all and only humans possess a right to life. Regan says we must therefore choose between two options:\n\n【9】通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Deny a right to life to both animals and defective humans, or\n\n【10】通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> Grant a right to life to both animals and defective humans.\n\n【11】Regan himself endorses the latter option, granting a right to life to both animals and impaired human beings. However, it would seem that to ethically justify current practices, such as using animals in biomedical research or consuming meat, we would be forced to choose the former option: deny both animals and impaired human beings a right to life. Yet, if we choose this option, we are left with the question of how we can ethically justify a requirement to treat impaired humans better than animals. The conclusion Regan and other liberals draw is that, to avoid this consequence, we should predicate personhood of impaired human beings, and also acknowledge that at least some animals are persons as well.\n\n【12】Both the conservative and liberal positions represent a “deontological” approach to ethics. Deontological approaches hold that there are certain overriding moral principles or duties that apply irrespective of whether fulfilling their requirements is burdensome or produces the best consequences overall. If the basis of our duties to humans or animals is rights , then we must discharge our duties regardless of whether doing so is convenient or promotes the general happiness. According to a rights-based liberal view, any practice that fails to respect the rights of those animals who possess them is wrong. So if we eat, hunt, experiment on, or use animals for entertainment, this is wrong if the animals in question have a right to life, even if it produces a tremendous amount of benefit for others. Likewise, if all human beings are persons with a right to life, as conservatives claim, then there is no condition where we would be justified in sacrificing a human life in order to bring about the greater good for society at large.\n\n【13】###### The “moderate” view\n\n【14】Let us set aside the question of whether animals are persons with a right to life, and turn to consider a different question, namely: is it wrong to cause animals to suffer? Peter Singer thinks that, regardless of where one comes down on the question of whether animals have rights, they have interests ,通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>13 </sup></u> specifically, an interest in avoiding suffering. According to Singer, it is wrong to eat meat given modern methods of meat production or to use animals in scientific research for trivial purposes, because of the interest animals have in avoiding suffering. Thus, according to Singer, the moderate position is sufficient to establish that we must bring animals into our sphere of moral concern. Even if it is sometimes acceptable to use animals or to end their lives painlessly, many of our current practices would have to change if the moderate position is correct.\n\n【15】In support of this approach, Singer advances the following Principle of Equal Consideration :\n\n【16】> The interests of every being must be given equal consideration, in proportion to their degree of seriousness for the being in question.\n\n【17】This principle begins with the idea of having an interest . According to Singer, the capacity for suffering or enjoyment is sufficient to establish that a being has an interest. A cat or dog, for example, suffers terribly if it is picked up by its tail and thrown across the room, and so it has a clear interest in avoiding this. Similarly, some experiments subject animals to pain, stress, anxiety, illness, and other forms of suffering. Without a doubt, animals have an interest in avoiding suffering produced in this way.\n\n【18】But there is a difference between equal consideration and equal treatment . In fact, equal consideration for the interests of humans and animals might require very different treatment. Consideration for the interests of a pig might require no more than that we leave a pig with other pigs in a place where there is adequate food and room to run freely, whereas concern for the interests of a child growing up in America might require that we teach the child to read.\n\n【19】In some cases, the greater mental power of normal adults will mean that they will suffer more. They will anticipate suffering, remember it, and have a fuller idea of their predicament. In other cases, the greater mental powers of normal adults will mean that they suffer less. As Singer notes, prisoners during wartime are able to understand that:\n\n【20】> although they must submit to capture, search, and confinement, they will not otherwise be harmed and will be set free at the conclusion of hostilities. If we capture wild animals, however, we cannot explain that we are not threatening their lives.删除5：<u>通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>10</sup></u></u>\nSinger draws on these ideas to develop the following argument against certain forms of animal experimentation.\n\n【21】通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> The interests of every being must be given equal consideration, in proportion to their degree of seriousness for the being in question.\n\n【22】通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> Animals have a very serious interest in avoiding suffering and in being able to live in a way that allows their instinctive desires and drives to be satisfied.\n\n【23】通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> Animal research causes serious suffering and does not permit animals to satisfy instinctive desires and drives.\n\n【24】通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> A great deal of animal research satisfies no direct or urgent purpose, or satisfies only relatively minor human interests.\n\n【25】通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> Therefore, continuing with a great deal of animal research involves weighting relatively minor human interests above very serious interests of the animals in question, and hence is morally unacceptable.\n\n【26】通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u> In many cases, it is not possible to conduct these experiments without using the sorts of methods which are objectionable.\n\n【27】通用删除7(英):<u>(7)</u> Therefore, in many cases , we should end current animal research.\n\n【28】Note that Singer’s argument does not conclude with an absolute probation against inflicting pain and suffering on animals. Nor does it ban experiments that result in the painless death of animals. Singer is not saying that all experimenting on animals ought to stop immediately. Instead, the argument establishes that the suffering of animals must be taken seriously and justified by the positive benefits it helps to bring about. It is consistent with this argument to allow experimenting on animals in situations where the trade-offs justify the pain and suffering inflicted. As Singer notes, “We have still not answered the question of when an experiment might be justifiable. It will not do to say ‘Never!’ Putting morality in such black and white terms is appealing, because it eliminates the need to think about particular cases; but in extreme circumstances, such absolutist answers always break down.” Singer proposes that a good test of whether an experiment is ethically justified is to consider whether or not we would consider conducting it on humans who are impaired and have a mental life similar to the animal we are proposing to use. For Singer, the ethically crucial requirement is that our actions produce as much pleasure and happiness and as little pain and misery as possible for all beings that have the capacity to experience happiness and misery.\n\n【29】The general structure of Singer’s argument can be applied in many other areas. For example, Singer advances a similar argument in support of taking seriously the suffering of animals used in modern methods of meat production. As in the argument about using animals in experiments, Singer is not putting forth an absolutist conclusion. Rather than supporting strict vegetarianism, he allows for the possibility that eating meat is sometimes morally acceptable. For example, it is permissible to consume meat when a wild animal that is painlessly killed is eaten by people who would otherwise suffer hunger.\n\n【30】Opponents of Singer’s moderate position argue that the position entails consequences we are not willing to accept. One such consequence is that, just as we are sometimes ethically allowed to eat animals, or to end the lives of animals painlessly in a medical experiment, so too we would sometimes be ethically allowed to eat humans for meat or to end their lives painlessly in a medical experiment. This objection to Singer holds that by failing to recognize the inviolability of the moral claims of all morally considerable beings, “utilitarianism cannot accommodate one of our most basic prima facie principles, namely that killing a morally considerable being is wrong.”通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>14</sup></u>\n\n【31】In contrast to a conservative or liberal position, a moderate position is vulnerable to such an objection precisely because it does not ascribe a right to life to humans or animals. Thus, for a moderate, such as Singer, our duties to other beings, whether human beings or animals, depend on what competing interests happen to be at stake in any given situation.\n\n【32】In contrast to the deontological approaches of Kant and Regan, Singer’s approach is an example of a consequentialist view. Consequentialist arguments hold that the moral worth of our actions is measured solely by the consequences they produce, not by their conformity to an overarching principle or duty. For this reason, Singer can say, for example, that:\n\n【33】> Torturing a human being is almost always wrong, but it is not absolutely wrong. If torture were the only way in which we could discover the location of a nuclear bomb hidden in a New York City basement and timed to go off within the hour, then torture would be justifiable.删除5：<u>通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>13</sup></u></u>\nLikewise, experimenting on brain-damaged human beings will almost never be justified, but under rare circumstances could be.\n\n【34】#### Key points\n\n【35】• There are three distinct answers one might give to the question, is there anything morally distinctive about humanity?\n\n【36】• The “conservative” answer: humans alone have moral standing and a right to life.\n\n【37】• The “liberal” approach: some animals possess qualities that conservatives equate with moral standing and “personhood,” and some human beings lack those qualities.\n\n【38】• The “moderate” view: what is morally important about humans and animals is their capacity to suffer; both humans and animals have an interest in avoiding suffering.\n\n【39】• For moderates, the moral acceptability of animal research depends on the balance of the suffering produced weighed against the importance of the interests the research serves: when animal research serves relatively minor, indirect, or nonurgent interests, but causes serious suffering, it is morally unacceptable.\n\n【40】• Both liberals and conservatives hold that there are absolute prohibitions against harming “persons” or treating them as a means only; these apply regardless of whether abiding by such prohibitions produces the best consequences overall.\n\n【41】• For both liberals and conservatives the moral acceptability of research with animals or human beings depends on whether or not the subjects of research are persons with a right to life.\n\n【42】####", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 11:54:43", "endTime": "2024/09/12 11:55:11", "cost": 27.719}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:29", "update_time": "2024-09-11 19:55:11", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 19:54:43"}

She had undergone a uterine dilation and curettage at that time. Her menstrual history was unremarkable previously； hence， she meets the definition of secondary amenorrhea (6 months of no menses in a woman with previously nor-mal menses). Pregnancy is the most common cause of secondary amenorrhea and thus， should be the first condition to be ruled out. The stepwise algorithm to assess for the etiology for amenorrhea is noted in Figure 49-1. Secondary amenorrhea may be caused by hypothalamic etiologies (such as hypothyroidism or hyperpro-lactinemia)， pituitary conditions (such as Sheehan syndrome)， or ovarian causes(such as premature ovarian failure). The patient does not have symptoms ofhypo-thyroidism or galactorrhea， or hot flushes. Additionally， her history indicates that prior to an acute event， her miscarriage， she had regular menses. With no indication of a postpartum hemorrhage， the most probable source of her amenorrhea is an issue with the end organ， her uterus. Hence， the most likely diagnosis is intrauter-ine adhesions， arising from the curettage of the uterus. With this condition， the hypothalamus， pituitary， and ovary are working normally， but the endometrial tis-sue is not responsive to the hormonal changes. To confirm that the uterine cavity is obliterated with adhesions， a hysterosalpingogram， a radiologic study where radi-opaque dye is injected into the uterine cavity via a transcervical catheter， or saline infusion ultrasound study can be used.\n删除3：<u>Figure 49-1.

It is most commonly due to injury to the pregnant or recently pregnant uterus secondary to curettage leading to damage of the endometrial basalis layer. However， any mechanical， infectious， or radiation factor can produce endometrial sclerosis and adhesion formation， including com-mon uterine surgeries like cesarean sections and myomectomies. The adhesions are usually strands of avascular fibrous tissue， but they may also consist of inactive endometrium or myometrium. Myometrial adhesions are usually dense and vas-cular carrying a poor prognosis. Women with atrophic and sclerotic endometrium without adhesions carry the worst prognosis. This is usually found after radiation or tuberculous endometritis and is not amenable to any therapy. Postpartum curet-tage performed usually for concerns for retained products of conception， combined with hypoestrogenic states such as breast-feeding or hypogonadotropic hypogo-nadism， is associated with extensive intrauterine scar formation. Uterine curettage performed after a missed abortion is associated with a higher incidence of intra-uterine synechiae than curettage performed after an incomplete abortion or a molar pregnancy. Adhesions may also form after a diagnostic D&C. In general， the rou-tine use ofuterine curettage at the time of a diagnostic laparoscopy is unwarranted and may damage the endometrium.\n\n【31】Intrauterine adhesions should be suspected if a woman presents with secondary amenorrhea， a negative pregnancy test， and does not have progestin-induced with-drawal bleeding . There is no consistent correlation between the menstrual bleeding patterns and the extent of intrauterine adhesions. The diagnosis of IUA should be suspected in every patient with infertility， recur-rent abortions， uterine trauma， and menstrual abnormalities. The most common methods of diagnosing IUA are by hysterosalpingogram or SIS. Classic hysterosal-pingogram findings include irregular， angulated filling defects within the uterine cavity. In cases of severe intrauterine adhesions， the cavity cannot be sounded，mak-ing the procedure very difficult to perform. Vaginal ultrasound without saline lacks specificity. Saline infusion sonohysterography is an excellent complement to the vaginal ultrasound and can allow for the evaluation of the uterine cavity. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is expensive and does not offer a greater advantage over the other diagnostic modalities. Hysteroscopy allows for direct visualization of the uterine cavity and is considered the “gold standard”for the establishment of the diagnosis and extent of the IUA.\n\n| Table 49-1·ETIOLOGIES OF SECONDARY AMENORRHEA  |\n| --- |\n| Hypothalamic causes Excessive exercise， weight lossStress Hypothyroidism，hyperprolactinemiaPituitary causes Sheehan syndrome (necrosis) Irradiation or surgery on pituitaryOvarian causes Polycystic ovarian syndromePremature ovarian failure Outflow tract causes Intrauterine adhesions Cervical stenosis  |\n\n【33】Operative hysteroscopy is the ideal treatment for IUA that allows direct transection of adhesions. The postoperative management may include the inser-tion of an IUD or preferentially a pediatric Foley catheter for 7 days postopera-tively to prevent the recently lysed adhesions from reforming. In addition， the administration of conjugated estrogens and progesterone (medroxyprogester-one acetate) should be considered. Repetitive treatments may be necessary to regain reproductive potential. The uterine cavity should be re-evaluated prior to attempting conception. Although 70% to 80% of patients with IUA have been able to achieve pregnancies， these pregnancies are at an increased risk of being complicated by premature labor， placenta accreta， placenta previa， and/ or post-partum hemorrhage.\n\n【34】CASE CORRELATION\n删除25：<u>See also Case 12 (Placenta Accreta) which is more common when the placenta attaches to areas of uterine adhesions.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 14:54:39", "endTime": "2024/09/12 14:55:11", "cost": 31.588}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:29", "update_time": "2024-09-11 22:55:11", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 22:54:39"}

For this 66-year-old woman without a prior history of abdominal opera-tions presenting with these signs and symptoms， and abdominal radiography indicating high-grade SBO， there are a couple of options that may be reason-able. One option is to obtain a CT scan to help delineate what is causing this process (eg small bowel neoplasm， obstructing cecal caner， or internal her-nia). A second option is to proceed with immediate operation and determine what the problem is in the operating room. Because this patient does not have concerning evidence for complicated obstruction， there is no urgency in proceeding with immediate operation. Therefore， the best choice is to per-form a CT scan to help delineate what is causing her obstructive symptoms.\n\n【38】18.2ID.The 33-year-old-man with early postoperative (postoperative day 11) SBO is most likely to have resolution of the bowel obstruction without operative treatment. The 1-year-old patient with a midgut volvulus needs early opera-tive treatment because there is a high rate of ischemic necrosis associated with this process. The patient with complete SBO and incarcerated inguinal hernia should be treated with operative treatment rather than an attempt at reduction of the inguinal hernia， because the obstructive symptoms have been on-going for 3 days， and there is an increased risk of bowel ischemia when hernia incarceration and SBO have been going on for more than just a few hours. For the other remaining patients， operative treatment is preferred because the obstructions are all associated with conditions that are not likely to resolve spontaneously.\n\n【39】18.3D. This 72-year-old man with history of prior abdominal operation pres-ents with signs and symptoms consistent with SBO. Because there are several clinical signs (abdominal focal tenderness) and laboratory indicators (leuko-cytosis and low bicarb value) suggestive of complicated obstruction， the best treatment option is to proceed with early abdominal exploration.\n\n【40】18.4D. A CT scan can help provide additional information regarding the location and extent of the obstructive process in this patient with partial resolution of her obstruction with nonoperative management. The high NG output suggests that the obstructive process has not completely resolved； therefore， feeding the patient at this time may actually worsen her condition. Another strategy not listed here is a Gastrografin challenge that might help promote earlier resolution of her obstruction.\n\n【41】18.5IB. This 27-year-old man has early postoperative SBO (SBO occurring within30 days of an abdominal operation). Most cases of early SBO can be success-fully managed without operative intervention. A Gastrografin challenge is the best option provided here.\n\n【42】18.6 C. The incidence of postoperative SBO following laparoscopic appendec-tomy is lower than the rate of postoperative SBO following open appendec-tomy. The rate of SBO following medical treatment of acute appendicitis is relatively unknown. The patient’s age is not a known factor that influences postoperative SBO occurrence.\n\n【43】Persistent pain， fever， tachycardia， localized abdominal tenderness， ele-vated serum amylase， and reduced serum bicarbonate level are findings suggestive ofcomplicated SBO.\n\n【44】Patients with closed-loop obstruction require early operative intervention.\n\n【45】》 CTscan is helpfulto differentiate SBO from ileus， because it can identify a point ofcaliber change in the small bowel (“transition point\").\n\n【46】》CT feature suggestive of complicated SBO includes intraperitoneal free fluid， decreased bowel wall perfusion， and presence ofa swirl sign.\n\n【47】Air in the gallbladder or biliary tree (pneumobilia) in a patient with SBO is highly suggestive of gallstone ileus.\n\n【48】》As many as 10-15% of patients with gallstone ileus may have a second stone in the gastrointestinaltract；therefore，the entire small bowelshould be examined during the operation for gallstone ileus.\n\n【49】》A cecal carcinoma may cause obstruction at the ileal-cecal valve， thus mimic a small bowelobstruction.\n\n【50】Apatient with SBO from an incarcerated hernia associated with overlying edema and/or inflammatory changes has a high likelihood of ischemic or necrotic bowel at the site of strangulation， and these patients should undergo surgery rather than attempts at hernia reduction.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 11:35:55", "endTime": "2024/09/12 11:36:16", "cost": 21.077}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:29", "update_time": "2024-09-11 19:36:16", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 19:35:55"}

She has diffuse, blanching, erythematous macules, and papules but otherwise appears well.\n\n【8】• Most likely diagnosis: Roseola\n\n【9】• Most likely cause of the illness: Human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6)\n\n【10】• Treatment: Supportive only, as the rash is likely to resolve in 24 to 48 hours\n\n【11】### ANALYSIS\n\n【12】#### Objectives\n\n【13】1\\. Be able to identify common rashes associated with viral infections in children.\n\n【14】2\\. Know the appropriate management of febrile illness associated with rashes in children.\n\n【15】#### Considerations\n\n【16】This toddler has a history of fever, and rash that is diffuse, erythematous papules. This is most likely due to roseola, caused by human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6). HHV-6 is a ubiquitous virus that infects most children between 6 months and 3 years, although most infections are asymptomatic. The virus has an incubation period of 1 to 2 weeks and causes a prodromal illness associated with mild respiratory symptoms and a sudden high fever (39°C-40°C), which in rare cases can cause febrile seizures. After a few days the fever improves and the red rash appears.\n\n【17】### APPROACH TO:  \nFever and Rash\n\n【18】### DEFINITIONS\n\n【19】ENANTHEM: An eruption on a mucous membrane as a symptom of a disease\n\n【20】EXANTHEM: An eruption on the skin as a symptom of a disease\n\n【21】### CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【22】Febrile illness and rashes are extremely common presentations in family medicine and pediatric offices. Most of the time these presentations represent mild, self-limited illnesses that require no specific therapy. However, some of these presentations will represent serious infections that need urgent intervention. Rashes associated with fever may be caused by viruses, bacteria, spirochetes, drug reaction, or autoimmune diseases. The patient history should attempt to identify any exposures that may cause these syndromes. Specific information that may be helpful include the duration of the illness, other associated symptoms, contact with any other ill person, history of recent travel, use of medications, or exposure to animals and insects (eg, ticks). A review of immunization status is critical, as many vaccine preventable diseases can cause fever and rash. Immunization does not guarantee immunity but may result in a less-severe presentation of the disease.\n\n【23】A thorough physical examination with a complete skin examination should be performed. Examination findings can both lead to a specific diagnosis and identify complications of the causative agent. For example, the presence of exudative pharyngitis along with fever and rash may suggest scarlet fever caused by a group A Streptococcus infection, while an abnormal lung examination in a patient with crops of vesicles of different ages may lead to a diagnosis of varicella (chicken pox) complicated by pneumonitis.\n\n【24】The ability to accurately describe skin lesions is necessary for documentation purposes. It is also important when you are not certain what the diagnosis is. Knowing the definitions of macules, papules, pustules, and the like will make it much easier and more accurate when you look for information in a textbook or journal or discuss a case with a colleague or consultant.

The virus has an incubation period of 1 to 2 weeks and causes a prodromal illness associated with mild respiratory symptoms and a high fever that can range from 101°F to 106°F (37.9°C to 41.1°C). This prodromal illness tends not to last for longer than 5 days. Following defervescence, a characteristic rash appears suddenly . It is an erythematous maculopapular eruption that starts on the trunk and spreads rapidly to the extremities, with sparing of the face. The rash tends to disappear in 1 to 2 days. The diagnosis is primarily clinical, based on the history and examination. Because of the short-lived nature of the disease, no treatment is usually required other than reassurance.\n\n【28】#### Varicella\n\n【29】The varicella zoster virus is a highly contagious virus that causes two clinical syndromes, chicken pox and shingles. Chicken pox is the more common childhood infection, but does occur in adolescents and adults, is generally more severe in adult cases, and is seen more commonly in winter or early spring. A typical case of chicken pox in children begins with the development of a rash in clusters followed by malaise, fever (38°C-42°C), and anorexia. The initial exanthem is often papules or vesicles on an erythematous base , described as “dewdrops on a rose petal.” The vesicles then progress to shallow, crusted erosions. Patients may also develop enanthems, with lesions on the oral, nasal, or gastrointestinal mucosa. In rare cases, serious complications may develop, which include encephalitis, meningitis, and pneumonitis. Super-infection of the vesicles with bacteria, most commonly group A Streptococcus and Staphylococcus aureus , is a particularly common and potentially dangerous complication. The contagious period continues 4 to 5 days after the appearance of the rash or until all lesions have crusted over. It takes 10 to 21 days after contact with an infected person for someone to develop chicken pox. The diagnosis of varicella is usually clinical, but may be confirmed with Tzanck smear or identification of the virus by DNA PCR (polymerase chain reaction). Antiviral therapy using acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir may shorten the course of the illness in patients older than 2 years of age if started within 24 hours of onset of the exanthem. Varicella vaccination is now universally recommended at age 12 to 18 months with a booster dose at age 4 to 6 years. While the vaccine has significantly reduced the incidence of childhood chicken pox, breakthrough infections can occur in vaccinated individuals. However, these infections are usually much less severe, with fewer vesicles and little to no fever. The varicella vaccine is a live, attenuated virus and should not be given to immunocompromised or pregnant patients.\n\n【30】Shingles, or herpes zoster , is a reactivation of the varicella virus, which can remain dormant in a dorsal root ganglion following the initial infection. The reactivated virus causes a vesicular eruption, usually along a single dermatome that does not cross the midline. The reaction can occur at any age, but is more common in the elderly or immunosuppressed. The rash can be extremely painful and can result in a painful, postherpetic neuralgia that lasts long after resolution of the rash. Antiviral therapy started within 72 hours of the rash may reduce the incidence of the postherpetic neuralgia. A herpes zoster vaccine is now recommended for people over 60.\n\n【31】#### Erythema Infectiosum\n\n【32】Parvovirus B19 causes a characteristic syndrome known as erythema infectiosum or fifth disease . This virus tends to infect children younger than 10 years of age and occurs most commonly in the winter or spring and is primarily spread by infected respiratory droplets. The child usually has a prodrome of mild fever and upper respiratory symptoms before outbreak of the rash lasting 4 to 14 days. The rash usually starts as confluent erythematous macules on the face, which usually spares the nose and periorbital regions. This gives the classic “slapped cheek” appearance that is commonly diagnostic of the infection. The facial rash lasts for 2 to 4 days, followed by a lacy, pruritic exanthem on the trunk and extremities that usually lasts for 1 to 2 weeks, but can have a relapsing course for several months. Parvovirus B19 in adults and older adolescents tends to cause a more severe illness, with rheumatic complaints such as arthritis. In patients with sickle cell disease, parvovirus B19 infection can lead to an aplastic crisis with anemia and leukopenia. The virus can also be transmitted from mother to fetus during pregnancy, resulting in fetal hydrops and pregnancy loss.\n\n【33】### COMMON BACTERIAL INFECTIONS\n\n【34】#### Group A β- Hemolytic Streptococcus\n\n【35】Group A β-hemolytic Streptococcus (GAS) is associated with numerous diseases, particularly in children. It is the causative agent of streptococcal pharyngitis and its complications, which include rheumatic fever and post-infectious glomerulonephritis. It can also cause impetigo, erysipelas, and cellulitis of the skin. Invasion and multiplication in the fascia can lead to necrotizing fasciitis.\n\n【36】The rash of scarlet fever usually starts about 2 days after the onset of sore throat and fever. The rash consists of punctate, raised, erythematous eruptions that can become confluent (Pastia lines) and feel like sandpaper. The rash tends to start on the upper trunk and spreads to the rest of the trunk and the extremities. The exanthem can also be associated with an enanthem, causing the appearance of a “strawberry tongue.” The rash fades and desquamation occurs 4 to 5 days after the first appearance of the rash.\n\n【37】GABS infections can be confirmed by rapid antigen testing or culture from a throat swab. Blood tests show marked leukocytosis with neutrophilia with normal or increased eosinophilia, elevated ESR, and elevated CRP. Anti-streptolysin O titre is elevated. The first-line treatment for GABS infections is penicillin, with cephalosporins or macrolides as alternatives in the penicillin-allergic patient. Patients should no longer be infectious 48 hours after taking antibiotics and should be counseled that they can return to school or work if fever free and on antibiotics for at least 24 hours. Exposed individuals need to be monitored for fever and other symptoms for at least a week and should receive treatment if they have a positive throat culture.\n\n【38】#### Neisseria Meningitidis\n\n【39】Neisseria Meningitidis ( meningococcus) can cause an acute, life-threatening infection , often associated with a rash. It is spread through respiratory secretions. Meningococcemia causes a severe illness with high fevers, hypotension, and altered mental status. Most people with meningococcemia progress to develop frank meningitis, with its associated signs of meningeal irritation. The rash of meningococcemia often starts as an erythematous maculopapular eruption that does not blanch with compression which progresses to form petechiae . The petechiae may coalesce into purpura in a condition known as purpura fulminans that can result in gangrene and amputation of limbs. Other complications include disseminated intravenous coagulation (DIC), adrenal hemorrhage, deafness, and cerebral and renal infarctions.\n\n【40】Someone with suspected meningococcemia should be immediately hospitalized, usually in the intensive care unit. The ABCs (airway, breathing, and circulation) should be urgently evaluated, blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures collected, and empiric antibiotic therapy instituted until an organism is grown out and drug sensitivities are obtained. Treatment should not be delayed by performing a lumbar puncture, as early and appropriate antibiotic treatment markedly improves the outcome of meningococcal infections . A common empiric regimen for presumed meningitis in infants less than 30 days old is ampicillin plus gentamicin, while for adults vancomycin plus ceftriaxone may be used. Antibiotic coverage can be later narrowed based on culture results. The first choice for proven meningococcal meningitis is penicillin G. A meningococcal vaccine is now recommended for routine childhood immunization and also should be offered to patients at risk for the disease (asplenic, those living in dormitories or military barracks). Close contacts of someone with meningococcal infection should be offered prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin or rifampin.\n\n【41】### TICK-BORNE DISEASES\n\n【42】#### Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever\n\n【43】Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) is an acute, life-threatening infection caused by the organism Rickettsia rickettsii , which is transmitted via various species of tick. The infection occurs more often in the summer months, when people are more likely to be outdoors. Despite its name, RMSF is most common in the southeastern United States, but does occur throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, Central America and parts of Southern America. The early phase of the illness causes nonspecific signs and symptoms such as fever, headache, myalgias, arthralgias, and fatigue. Some patients, especially children, will complain of abdominal pain. The classic exanthem is a macular, papular, or petechial eruption that starts on the wrists and ankles and spreads both centrally and to the palms and soles. The rash develops between the third and fifth day of the illness . Laboratory tests often show a low white blood cell count, low platelet count, hyponatremia, and elevated liver enzymes. The diagnosis is confirmed with serology, but this is not helpful in the acute setting. Due to its severity, a high suspicion for RMSF should be maintained and likely cases of the illness treated empirically with doxycycline. Early treatment is important as there is an associated risk of fatal outcome after day 5 of the illness and therapy should be continued for at least 3 days after the patient becomes afebrile.\n\n【44】#### Lyme Disease\n\n【45】Lyme disease is endemic in many areas of the United States, including New England and the mid-Atlantic regions. The causative spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi , is transmitted via the bite of ticks of the Ixodes species. Because the tick is very small, infected persons are often unaware of a history of a tick bite. The characteristic rash, erythema migrans , develops 3 to 30 days following infection. The exanthema is typically an expanding erythematous macule with central clearing, often described as appearing like a “bull’s-eye.” Early dissemination of the disease can present as multiple secondary erythema migrans, Bell’s palsy, aseptic meningitis, carditis, and rarely as complete heart block. Late disease is most characteristically marked by arthritis. The treatment of choice for Lyme disease is doxycycline and the diagnosis can be confirmed with serologic studies. Table 48–1 provides a summary of some of the most common causes of the presentation of rash and fever in children.\n删除4：<u>Table 48–1 • INFECTIOUS CAUSES OF FEVER AND RASH</u>\n\n【46】###", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 13:40:13", "endTime": "2024/09/12 13:41:22", "cost": 68.072}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:29", "update_time": "2024-09-11 21:41:22", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 21:40:13"}

There are many causes for congestive heart failure. In this patient， atrial fibrillation with irregular ventricular rhythm leads to inadequate ventricular filling and decreased stroke volume. The likely explanation in this case is running out of medication (digoxin). Other factors that can present as congestive heart failure include myocardial infarction and cardiomyopathy (decreased contractility) as well as valvular problems (aortic valve stenosis). Clinically， these patients pres-ent with symptoms of fluid “backing up”in the cardiovascular system. They often have pulmonary edema， peripheral edema， and increased jugular disten-tion. A chest x-ray will reveal bilateral pulmonary edema with cardiomegaly. An echocardiograph can be used to calculate the ejection fraction， a measure of contractility. The ejection fraction is the fraction of the end-diastolic volume ejected in each stroke volume (normal =55%). Treatment of congestive heart failure depends on the etiology， but usually diuretics are given to relieve some of the excess fluid and medications are given (digitalis) to increase the con-tractility of the heart and improve cardiac output. A patient with atrial fibrilla-tion would benefit from medications to decrease conduction through the atrioventricular (AV) node or cardioversion to convert heart rate back to normal sinus rhythm.\n\n【13】APPROACHTO PHYSIOLOGY OF CARDIAC MECHANICS\n\n【14】Objectives 删除换行 1Describe excitation-contraction coupling in the heart.删除5：<u>23</u>\nDescribe factors regulating the force of myocardial contractions.\n\n【15】Describe the cardiac cycle.\n\n【16】Definitions\n\n【17】Systole： The period of time during which the heart muscle is contracting.\n\n【18】Diastole： The period of time during which the heart muscle is relaxed.\n\n【19】Heart sounds： The sounds produced by turbulent flow within the heart and by vibrations induced in structures comprising the heart.\n\n【20】Contractility： The ability of a muscle to shorten and/or develop force that does not depend upon a change in initial fiber length or afterload.\n\n【21】DISCUSSION\n\n【22】Cardiac and skeletal muscles have many similarities； however， there are important differences. Both are striated muscles， are excitable， and are reg-ulated by calcium . However， cardiac muscle fibers are smaller than skeletal muscle fibers， and， unlike skeletal muscle fibers， cardiac muscle fibers branch and are electrically coupled to one another.\n\n【23】Excitation of myocardial cells results from the propagation of action poten-tials from nodal cells， conduction fibers， or adjacent myocardial cells through low-resistance membrane junctions. There are no neuromuscular junctions as is seen in skeletal muscle. As in skeletal muscle， the mediator between mem-brane action potentials (excitation) and contraction is calcium. However， in contrast to skeletal muscle， a significant amount of calcium enters the cell through sarcolemma calcium channels during the action potential. This increase in calcium permeability accounts in large part for the plateau phase of the myocardial action potential， and the calcium that enters triggers the release of additional calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The enter-ing and released calcium then binds to troponin C to initiate events that lead to contraction. Between action potentials， much of the calcium is taken back up into the sarcoplasmic reticulum by primary active transport. However， to main-tain calcium balance， some calcium exits the cell by a secondary active process located on the sarcolemma. Calcium exit is coupled to and driven by the entry of sodium down its electrochemical gradient. The entering sodium then is expelled by the sodium pump.\n\n【24】The force of contraction of cardiac muscle can vary from beat to beat as a result of two basic mechanisms inherent to cardiac muscle. The first is the length-tension (or force) relationship， also known as the Starling law of the\n\n【25】Muscle length\n删除3：<u>Figure 11-1. Relationship of muscle force and muscle length. The active and passive characteristics are added to supply a composite.</u>\n\n【26】heart. A basic property of all muscles is that there is an optimal length for active force development. At lengths greater and less than this optimal length(L)， less active force will be developed . In vivo， this rela-tionship is not important for skeletal muscles because their lengths are restricted close to L. because of their attachment to tendons and bones. For the heart， however， the size of the chambers and hence the length of the cardiac muscle cells before systole will vary depending on the end-diastolic volume of blood. This volume in turn depends in large part on central venous pressure and the compliance of the ventricles. Under most conditions， myocardial cells operate at lengths at which an increase in end-diastolic muscle length leads to a more forceful contraction and a larger stroke volume. This helps balance venous return and cardiac output. The length-tension relationship may have both structural and biochemical bases. For active force to develop， myosin cross-bridges must interact with actin filaments. At L，the overlap of thick and thin filaments is such that every cross-bridge has easy access to actin (thin) fil-aments， allowing each one to develop force. At muscle lengths longer than L， some of the cross-bridges do not overlap thin filaments and thus cannot develop force. At muscle lengths less than L， the lateral distances over which the cross-bridges reach to attach to actin filaments is greater， and at very short lengths， thin filaments from one side can interfere with cross-bridge interac-tions on the other side. Biochemically， it appears that the calcium sensitivity of the actin-myosin interaction also is impaired at short muscle lengths. Thus， activation of the contractile machinery will be less.\n\n【27】The second mechanism responsible for regulating the force of myocardial contraction is referred to as contractility. Changes in contractility alter the force of contraction at any given muscle length， as shown in Figure 11-2. An increase in contractility will result in greater force and a greater stroke volume\n删除3：<u>Figure 11-2. ForceversusImuscle lengthwith different contractility characteristics.</u>\n\n【28】at any muscle length (chamber volume)， thus increasing the ejection fraction. A decrease in contractility will have the opposite effect. The mechanisms responsible for changes in contractility mostly involve calcium metabolism and include alterations in 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> calcium entry during the action potential， 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u>cal-cium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum， 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> calcium binding to troponin-C， 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> calcium uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum， and 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> calcium extrusion from the myocyte. Physiologically， changes in contractility result mainly from changes in sympathetic nerve activity. Activation of myocardial B-adrenergic receptors by norepinephrine and epinephrine results in stimula-tory G protein activation of adenylyl cyclase and resultant increases in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Increased cAMP activates protein kinase A to phosphorylate key proteins involved in many of the steps of calcium metabolism listed above. The result is greater activation of the myosin-actin interactions and greater force. In contrast， stimulation of muscarinic choliner-gic receptors by acetylcholine results in inhibitory G protein activation， inhi-bition of adenylyl cyclase activity， and less phosphorylation of the same proteins. This results in lesser activation of the myosin-actin interaction and less force.\n\n【29】The pumping of blood by the heart can be described best by considering events during a cardiac cycle， that is， during a systole and the following dias-tole . During the time marked A， atrial depolarization， as indicated by the P wave of the electrocardiograph (ECG)， leads to atrial con-traction (atrial systole) and complete ventricular filling. In some cases， the turbulence caused by this filling results in an audible fourth heart sound. During the time marked B， ventricular depolarization， as indicated by the QRS complex of the ECG， leads to a period of ventricular contraction during which ventricular pressure rises， closing the AV valves (producing the first heart sound)， but there is no ejection of blood into the aorta. This is the period\n\n【30】Time\n删除3：<u>Figure 11-3. Cardiac cycle. Pressures in the aorta， left ventricle， and atrium. Key cardiac valvular events are superimposed on the auscultation of the heart and the electrocardiograph.</u>\n\n【31】of isovolumetric ventricular contraction. During the time marked C， ven-tricular pressure surpasses aortic pressure and there is rapid emptying of blood， as indicated by the decrease in ventricular volume and the increase in aortic pressure. This constitutes the rapid ventricular ejection phase of the cycle. During the time indicated by D， the ventricles are repolarizing， as indi-cated by the T wave of the ECG； the force of ventricular contraction is decreasing； and the flow of blood into the aorta slows. This is the reduced ventricular ejection phase. During the time indicated by E， the ventricles con-tinue to relax， and aortic pressure soon exceeds ventricular pressure. This results in closure of the aortic valve and the second heart sound. Ventricular pressure then falls with no change in volume. This is the isovolumetric ven-tricular relaxation phase. During the time indicated by F， ventricular pressure falls below venous pressure， the AV valve opens， and the ventricle begins to fill rapidly， as indicated by the increase in ventricular volume. This is the rapid ventricular filling phase that sometimes produces an audible third heart sound. The time indicated by G is the period of reduced ventricular filling that occurs before the next period of atrial systole.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【26】heart.

Both are striated muscles， are excitable， and are reg-ulated by calcium . However， cardiac muscle fibers are smaller than skeletal muscle fibers， and， unlike skeletal muscle fibers， cardiac muscle fibers branch and are electrically coupled to one another.\n\n【23】Excitation of myocardial cells results from the propagation of action poten-tials from nodal cells， conduction fibers， or adjacent myocardial cells through low-resistance membrane junctions. There are no neuromuscular junctions as is seen in skeletal muscle. As in skeletal muscle， the mediator between mem-brane action potentials (excitation) and contraction is calcium. However， in contrast to skeletal muscle， a significant amount of calcium enters the cell through sarcolemma calcium channels during the action potential. This increase in calcium permeability accounts in large part for the plateau phase of the myocardial action potential， and the calcium that enters triggers the release of additional calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The enter-ing and released calcium then binds to troponin C to initiate events that lead to contraction. Between action potentials， much of the calcium is taken back up into the sarcoplasmic reticulum by primary active transport. However， to main-tain calcium balance， some calcium exits the cell by a secondary active process located on the sarcolemma. Calcium exit is coupled to and driven by the entry of sodium down its electrochemical gradient. The entering sodium then is expelled by the sodium pump.\n\n【24】The force of contraction of cardiac muscle can vary from beat to beat as a result of two basic mechanisms inherent to cardiac muscle. The first is the length-tension (or force) relationship， also known as the Starling law of the\n\n【25】Muscle length\n删除3：<u>Figure 11-1. Relationship of muscle force and muscle length. The active and passive characteristics are added to supply a composite.</u>\n\n<mark>【26】heart. </mark>A basic property of all muscles is that there is an optimal length for active force development. At lengths greater and less than this optimal length(L)， less active force will be developed . In vivo， this rela-tionship is not important for skeletal muscles because their lengths are restricted close to L. because of their attachment to tendons and bones. For the heart， however， the size of the chambers and hence the length of the cardiac muscle cells before systole will vary depending on the end-diastolic volume of blood. This volume in turn depends in large part on central venous pressure and the compliance of the ventricles. Under most conditions， myocardial cells operate at lengths at which an increase in end-diastolic muscle length leads to a more forceful contraction and a larger stroke volume. This helps balance venous return and cardiac output. The length-tension relationship may have both structural and biochemical bases. For active force to develop， myosin cross-bridges must interact with actin filaments. At L，the overlap of thick and thin filaments is such that every cross-bridge has easy access to actin (thin) fil-aments， allowing each one to develop force. At muscle lengths longer than L， some of the cross-bridges do not overlap thin filaments and thus cannot develop force. At muscle lengths less than L， the lateral distances over which the cross-bridges reach to attach to actin filaments is greater， and at very short lengths， thin filaments from one side can interfere with cross-bridge interac-tions on the other side. Biochemically， it appears that the calcium sensitivity of the actin-myosin interaction also is impaired at short muscle lengths. Thus， activation of the contractile machinery will be less.\n\n【27】The second mechanism responsible for regulating the force of myocardial contraction is referred to as contractility. Changes in contractility alter the force of contraction at any given muscle length， as shown in Figure 11-2. An increase in contractility will result in greater force and a greater stroke volume\n删除3：<u>Figure 11-2.

Physiologically， changes in contractility result mainly from changes in sympathetic nerve activity. Activation of myocardial B-adrenergic receptors by norepinephrine and epinephrine results in stimula-tory G protein activation of adenylyl cyclase and resultant increases in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Increased cAMP activates protein kinase A to phosphorylate key proteins involved in many of the steps of calcium metabolism listed above. The result is greater activation of the myosin-actin interactions and greater force. In contrast， stimulation of muscarinic choliner-gic receptors by acetylcholine results in inhibitory G protein activation， inhi-bition of adenylyl cyclase activity， and less phosphorylation of the same proteins. This results in lesser activation of the myosin-actin interaction and less force.\n\n【29】The pumping of blood by the heart can be described best by considering events during a cardiac cycle， that is， during a systole and the following dias-tole . During the time marked A， atrial depolarization， as indicated by the P wave of the electrocardiograph (ECG)， leads to atrial con-traction (atrial systole) and complete ventricular filling.

Activation of myocardial B-adrenergic receptors by norepinephrine and epinephrine results in stimula-tory G protein activation of adenylyl cyclase and resultant increases in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Increased cAMP activates protein kinase A to phosphorylate key proteins involved in many of the steps of calcium metabolism listed above. The result is greater activation of the myosin-actin interactions and greater force. In contrast， stimulation of muscarinic choliner-gic receptors by acetylcholine results in inhibitory G protein activation， inhi-bition of adenylyl cyclase activity， and less phosphorylation of the same proteins. This results in lesser activation of the myosin-actin interaction and less force.\n\n【29】The pumping of blood by the heart can be described best by considering events during a cardiac cycle， that is， during a systole and the following dias-tole . During the time marked A， atrial depolarization， as indicated by the P wave of the electrocardiograph (ECG)， leads to atrial con-traction (atrial systole) and complete ventricular filling. In some cases， the turbulence caused by this filling results in an audible fourth heart sound. During the time marked B， ventricular depolarization， as indicated by the QRS complex of the ECG， leads to a period of ventricular contraction during which ventricular pressure rises， closing the AV valves (producing the first heart sound)， but there is no ejection of blood into the aorta. This is the period\n\n【30】Time\n删除3：<u>Figure 11-3. Cardiac cycle. Pressures in the aorta， left ventricle， and atrium.

During the time marked C， ven-tricular pressure surpasses aortic pressure and there is rapid emptying of blood， as indicated by the decrease in ventricular volume and the increase in aortic pressure. This constitutes the rapid ventricular ejection phase of the cycle. During the time indicated by D， the ventricles are repolarizing， as indi-cated by the T wave of the ECG； the force of ventricular contraction is decreasing； and the flow of blood into the aorta slows. This is the reduced ventricular ejection phase. During the time indicated by E， the ventricles con-tinue to relax， and aortic pressure soon exceeds ventricular pressure. This results in closure of the aortic valve and the second heart sound. Ventricular pressure then falls with no change in volume. This is the isovolumetric ven-tricular relaxation phase. During the time indicated by F， ventricular pressure falls below venous pressure， the AV valve opens， and the ventricle begins to fill rapidly， as indicated by the increase in ventricular volume. This is the rapid ventricular filling phase that sometimes produces an audible third heart sound. The time indicated by G is the period of reduced ventricular filling that occurs before the next period of atrial systole.", "index": 10418, "show": true, "start": 10392, "end": 10400, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/09/12 14:28:15", "endTime": "2024/09/12 14:29:22", "cost": 67.023}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:29", "update_time": "2024-09-11 22:29:22", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 22:28:15"}

Our field of interest, orofacial, is included 删除10：<u>(Soulet 1989 )</u>. After all, orofacial shapes are generated by osteogenesis which is produced by minimal pressure exerted by surrounding tissues. This is due to the fact that orofacial bones have intramembranous ossification. Its growth and development are associated with the force of soft tissues along with genetic and environmental characteristics.\n\n【10】Not all bone structures have the same consistency. The quality is related to the osseous biography of the patients. It is important to recognize the prenatal antecedents, the quality of food consumed by the mother during pregnancy, whether the gestation was normal or had problems, and what type of medication was taken (Moyano).\n\n【11】Functions carried out by the cranial-cervical orofacial system:\n\n【12】   Swallowing (sucking)\n\n【13】   Respiration/breathing\n\n【14】   Chewing\n\n【15】These are vital functions that are well defined and reciprocal among them.\n\n【16】Functions in relation to communication:\n\n【17】   Speaking/language\n\n【18】   Expressive mimic\n\n【19】2.1 Functions of the Cranial-Cervical-Orofacial System\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】### 2.1.1 Swallowing\n\n【21】Swallowing is a complex biological function; it is meant to transfer saliva, solids (previously chewed), liquids, and other substances safely from the mouth to the stomach. It is the beginning of the digestive process which prepares and conduces food so that it is later absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. The purpose of these physiological habits is to produce energy which is needed for growth, development, and maturity of the child. It also provides adults with energy for their daily activities.\n\n【22】### 2.1.2 Evolution of Swallowing\n\n【23】#### 2.1.2.1 Swallowing in the Fetus\n\n【24】It is a biological and physiological process that is programmed genetically. This function begins inside the womb; the fetus swallows amniotic liquid and this contributes to the regulation of the volume of the liquid between mother and fetus (Moyano). The motor activity is made evident through the reflex of opening the mouth, the stimulation of the lip, and the proximity of the hand to the mouth, all of which show neurological maturity. Once the reflex of sucking appears, sucking and swallowing are associated and continue until birth. Its efficiency is of utmost importance for the newborn baby’s feeding. This activity reflects where all the motor nuclei of the brain stem participate.\n\n【25】#### 2.1.2.2 Swallowing in Newborn and Nursing Babies\n\n【26】Sucking while nursing is a consequence of the stimulation of the upper lip or the mucosa of the premaxilla. Its efficacy is paramount since suction ensures swallowing because they are inseparable. At this stage, swallowing is still a mere reflex, from the mouth to the stomach. It is solely something that occurs as a consequence of the relationship the anatomical structures have.\n\n【27】The tongue is large in relation to the tissue that surrounds it; it is in an anterior position and rests on the gingival mamelons, stimulating the development of future teeth (Juri).\n\n【28】Nursing develops and consolidates the function of swallowing. It is extremely important for the harmonious development of the structures since propulsive movements of the mandible are produced along with neuromuscular orofacial activity that collaborates in the development of shape. Nursing is extremely important for the development of the child, not only because of the components in the milk but also because it consolidates the bond between the mother and child which ensures the psycho-affective development of the child. Health in this case does not only refer to physical well-being but also psychological. Many believe the origin of well-being begins when nursing.\n\n【29】#### 2.1.2.3 Swallowing in Children\n\n【30】When teeth begin to erupt, the behavior is modified and new occlusal contacts begin to appear; new habits such as lateralization of food in the mouth in order to chew begin to develop. These changes start progressively as of age 3, when all primary teeth are present. The orbicular shape of the lips meant to close firmly is no longer needed. Also, the tongue rests on the palate; there is molar contact and there is a change in the pattern of swallowing, from the anterior region to the posterior region. This stage of transition is consolidated thanks to the growth of the anatomical structures involved as well as to the maturation of the central nervous system.\n\n【31】If interposition of the tongue when swallowing or at rest is still present between ages 3 and 5, it will affect the primary teeth, even more so the permanent teeth. As a consequence, harmonious dental-maxillary growth will be affected.\n\n【32】#### 2.1.2.4 Functional or Mature Swallowing\n\n【33】It is the fine neuromuscular coordination that contributes to a balanced morphogenesis of the maxillary-mandibular arches, in concordance to growth, to the development of muscular anatomical structures, and to the level of maturity of the central nervous system.\n\n【34】What characterizes it are the following:\n\n【35】   Contact of both lips, without muscular contraction.\n\n【36】   Dental occlusion.\n\n【37】   The tip of the tongue lies on the (lingual incisor-anterior) retro-incisive area.\n\n【38】   The back of the tongue rests against the palate.\n\n【39】   The base descends at an angle of 45°.\n\n【40】Functional swallowing is intimately associated with nasal breathing. Any pathology that obstructs the airway will cause alterations in chewing and as a consequence, in the behavior of the tongue when swallowing (Moyano).\n\n【41】### 2.1.3 Stages or Phases of Functional Swallowing\n\n【42】Though, here, functional swallowing has been divided into four stages, it is important to keep in mind that swallowing is a succession of motions that occur quickly and that are interconnected (Gardiner).\n\n【43】#### 2.1.3.1 Oral Preparative Stage\n\n【44】In this stage solid food is processed, semisolid food is tasted, and liquids are displaced. It is completely conscious. How long this lasts depends on personality, emotions, size and consistency of food, secretion of saliva, and dental occlusion. Also, it is voluntary, so ingestion can be interrupted in case food is too hot, tastes bad, or contains odd particles (Segovia).\n\n【45】This is when pleasure is felt upon tasting food which is very associated with the sense of smell. The soft palate is in contact with the base of the tongue, the food stays in the mouth while chewing, and simultaneously breathing through the nostrils takes place. This enhances the ability to capture scents and aromas which make the experience more enjoyable. Sight also collaborates in this.\n\n【46】It begins with grip, cut, and transfer of the solid food toward the premolars and molars to be ground, crushed, and salivated. Mastication or chewing adequately prepares food to be swallowed . This food processing stage requires muscular integrity that enables complex movements as well as adequate dental occlusion.\n\n【47】Adequate bilateral mastication which is multidirectional, alternate, stimulates the support structures that contribute to the development of the maxilla, the mandible, and the stability of the occlusion and oral hygiene (Moyano).\n\n【48】Once food has been crushed and ground, aided by saliva, the food is moved to the back of the tongue in order to be pushed back and thus, the second stage begins.\n删除3：<u>Fig. 2.1\n\n【49】Oral preparative stage\n</u>\n#### 2.1.3.2 Exclusively Oral Stage or Transfer\n\n【50】Once food has been prepared and positioned on the back of the tongue, transfer of the food begins thanks to peristaltic motion that moves food to an anteroposterior position to push it toward the oropharynx . The tongue is of vital importance at this stage. The tip rests against the lingual surface of the incisors; the back is in contact with the soft palate, exerting pressure against the midpalatal suture. At this point, negative intraoral pressure is produced which favors the descent of the palate and multi-directional expansion. There is dental occlusion. The lips and muscles are not in contact; the soft palate is elevated to come into contact with the pharynx.\n删除3：<u>Fig. 2.2\n\n【51】Exclusively oral stage or transfer\n</u>\nBoth stages (oral preparative and transfer) are conscious and voluntary and affect proper dentoalveolar growth and development.\n\n【52】#### 2.1.3.3 Pharyngeal Stage\n\n【53】When the food reaches the oropharyngeal isthmus, the swallowing reflex is initiated. This includes  elevation and retraction of the soft palate; in order to contact the posterior and lateral soft pharynx, the isthmus faucium closes. Elevation and closing of the larynx to stop food from moving into the airway and relaxation of the superior esophageal valve is necessary.\n\n【54】This stage is crucial to stop the bolus from being regurgitated by the nose, returning to the mouth, or moving into the airway.\n\n【55】The sequence of motions during this pharyngeal phase pushes the bolus back and the intraoral pressure increases. This takes seconds and it is conscious and involuntary. At this point, respiratory apnea is produced (Segovia).\n删除3：<u>Fig. 2.3</u>\n\n【56】Pharyngeal stage\n\n【57】#### 2.1.3.4 Esophageal Stage\n\n【58】This stage starts when food moves through the superior esophageal sphincter and ends when it moves into the inferior esophageal sphincter .\n\n【59】This is unconscious and involuntary. It takes 8–20 s.\n删除3：<u>Fig. 2.4</u>\n\n【60】Esophageal stage\n\n【61】#### 2.1.3.5 Dysfunctional Swallowing or Tongue Thrusting\n\n【62】It is the malposition of the tongue, at rest and while swallowing. This dysfunction of the tongue affects the growth and development of the mouth. When it isn’t treated and continues, it is considered among the most common etiological factors that produce maxillofacial disharmony. It can also worsen and produce malocclusion, bearing in mind that proper function is not possible if the shape is not adequate. One way or another, dysfunction of the tongue must be taken into account and treated.\n\n【63】High position of the tongue (anterior open bite) .\n删除3：<u>Fig. 2.5\n\n【64】( a ) High position of the tongue.

This interposition is harmful for harmonious maxillofacial growth and development. Many call it the lip trap. This dysfunction of the lip is sometimes accompanied by tongue thrust, thus affecting the dental-maxillary relation even more.\n删除3：<u>Fig. 2.8\n\n【68】( a ) Usual position at rest.

It was denominated stomatognathic system for a long while. After detailed analysis of the complex number of tissues and organs and after considering the totality of the anatomical and functional elements, researchers have reached the conclusion that the name stomatognathic system is insufficient. That’s why currently, with wider and more modern criteria, it is now called cranial-cervical orofacial system (Moyano).\n\n【9】This system is a heterogeneous group of tissues and organs. Anatomical or functional alterations have the capacity to compensate or adapt and lead the child, youth, or adult to live in an unhealthy imbalance. The morphology of a subject is the result of the activity of the different muscular groups which throughout growth give shape to the skeleton. Our field of interest, orofacial, is included 删除10：<u>(Soulet 1989 )</u>. After all, orofacial shapes are generated by osteogenesis which is produced by minimal pressure exerted by surrounding tissues. This is due to the fact that orofacial bones have intramembranous ossification. Its growth and development are associated with the force of soft tissues along with genetic and environmental characteristics.\n\n【10】Not all bone structures have the same consistency. The quality is related to the osseous biography of the patients. It is important to recognize the prenatal antecedents, the quality of food consumed by the mother during pregnancy, whether the gestation was normal or had problems, and what type of medication was taken (Moyano).\n\n【11】Functions carried out by the cranial-cervical orofacial system:\n\n【12】   Swallowing (sucking)\n\n【13】   Respiration/breathing\n\n【14】   Chewing\n\n【15】These are vital functions that are well defined and reciprocal among them.\n\n【16】Functions in relation to communication:\n\n【17】   Speaking/language\n\n【18】   Expressive mimic\n\n【19】2.1 Functions of the Cranial-Cervical-Orofacial System\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】### 2.1.1 Swallowing\n\n【21】Swallowing is a complex biological function; it is meant to transfer saliva, solids (previously chewed), liquids, and other substances safely from the mouth to the stomach. It is the beginning of the digestive process which prepares and conduces food so that it is later absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. The purpose of these physiological habits is to produce energy which is needed for growth, development, and maturity of the child. It also provides adults with energy for their daily activities.\n\n【22】### 2.1.2 Evolution of Swallowing\n\n【23】#### 2.1.2.1 Swallowing in the Fetus\n\n【24】It is a biological and physiological process that is programmed genetically. This function begins inside the womb; the fetus swallows amniotic liquid and this contributes to the regulation of the volume of the liquid between mother and fetus (Moyano). The motor activity is made evident through the reflex of opening the mouth, the stimulation of the lip, and the proximity of the hand to the mouth, all of which show neurological maturity. Once the reflex of sucking appears, sucking and swallowing are associated and continue until birth. Its efficiency is of utmost importance for the newborn baby’s feeding. This activity reflects where all the motor nuclei of the brain stem participate.\n\n【25】#### 2.1.2.2 Swallowing in Newborn and Nursing Babies\n\n【26】Sucking while nursing is a consequence of the stimulation of the upper lip or the mucosa of the premaxilla. Its efficacy is paramount since suction ensures swallowing because they are inseparable. At this stage, swallowing is still a mere reflex, from the mouth to the stomach. It is solely something that occurs as a consequence of the relationship the anatomical structures have.\n\n【27】The tongue is large in relation to the tissue that surrounds it; it is in an anterior position and rests on the gingival mamelons, stimulating the development of future teeth (Juri).\n\n【28】Nursing develops and consolidates the function of swallowing. It is extremely important for the harmonious development of the structures since propulsive movements of the mandible are produced along with neuromuscular orofacial activity that collaborates in the development of shape. Nursing is extremely important for the development of the child, not only because of the components in the milk but also because it consolidates the bond between the mother and child which ensures the psycho-affective development of the child. Health in this case does not only refer to physical well-being but also psychological. Many believe the origin of well-being begins when nursing.\n\n【29】#### 2.1.2.3 Swallowing in Children\n\n【30】When teeth begin to erupt, the behavior is modified and new occlusal contacts begin to appear; new habits such as lateralization of food in the mouth in order to chew begin to develop. These changes start progressively as of age 3, when all primary teeth are present. The orbicular shape of the lips meant to close firmly is no longer needed. Also, the tongue rests on the palate; there is molar contact and there is a change in the pattern of swallowing, from the anterior region to the posterior region. This stage of transition is consolidated thanks to the growth of the anatomical structures involved as well as to the maturation of the central nervous system.\n\n【31】If interposition of the tongue when swallowing or at rest is still present between ages 3 and 5, it will affect the primary teeth, even more so the permanent teeth. As a consequence, harmonious dental-maxillary growth will be affected.\n\n【32】#### 2.1.2.4 Functional or Mature Swallowing\n\n【33】It is the fine neuromuscular coordination that contributes to a balanced morphogenesis of the maxillary-mandibular arches, in concordance to growth, to the development of muscular anatomical structures, and to the level of maturity of the central nervous system.\n\n【34】What characterizes it are the following:\n\n【35】   Contact of both lips, without muscular contraction.\n\n【36】   Dental occlusion.\n\n【37】   The tip of the tongue lies on the (lingual incisor-anterior) retro-incisive area.\n\n【38】   The back of the tongue rests against the palate.\n\n【39】   The base descends at an angle of 45°.\n\n【40】Functional swallowing is intimately associated with nasal breathing. Any pathology that obstructs the airway will cause alterations in chewing and as a consequence, in the behavior of the tongue when swallowing (Moyano).\n\n【41】### 2.1.3 Stages or Phases of Functional Swallowing\n\n【42】Though, here, functional swallowing has been divided into four stages, it is important to keep in mind that swallowing is a succession of motions that occur quickly and that are interconnected (Gardiner).\n\n【43】#### 2.1.3.1 Oral Preparative Stage\n\n【44】In this stage solid food is processed, semisolid food is tasted, and liquids are displaced. It is completely conscious. How long this lasts depends on personality, emotions, size and consistency of food, secretion of saliva, and dental occlusion. Also, it is voluntary, so ingestion can be interrupted in case food is too hot, tastes bad, or contains odd particles (Segovia).\n\n【45】This is when pleasure is felt upon tasting food which is very associated with the sense of smell. The soft palate is in contact with the base of the tongue, the food stays in the mouth while chewing, and simultaneously breathing through the nostrils takes place. This enhances the ability to capture scents and aromas which make the experience more enjoyable. Sight also collaborates in this.\n\n【46】It begins with grip, cut, and transfer of the solid food toward the premolars and molars to be ground, crushed, and salivated. Mastication or chewing adequately prepares food to be swallowed . This food processing stage requires muscular integrity that enables complex movements as well as adequate dental occlusion.\n\n【47】Adequate bilateral mastication which is multidirectional, alternate, stimulates the support structures that contribute to the development of the maxilla, the mandible, and the stability of the occlusion and oral hygiene (Moyano).\n\n【48】Once food has been crushed and ground, aided by saliva, the food is moved to the back of the tongue in order to be pushed back and thus, the second stage begins.\n删除3：<u>Fig. 2.1\n\n【49】Oral preparative stage\n</u>\n#### 2.1.3.2 Exclusively Oral Stage or Transfer\n\n【50】Once food has been prepared and positioned on the back of the tongue, transfer of the food begins thanks to peristaltic motion that moves food to an anteroposterior position to push it toward the oropharynx . The tongue is of vital importance at this stage. The tip rests against the lingual surface of the incisors; the back is in contact with the soft palate, exerting pressure against the midpalatal suture. At this point, negative intraoral pressure is produced which favors the descent of the palate and multi-directional expansion. There is dental occlusion. The lips and muscles are not in contact; the soft palate is elevated to come into contact with the pharynx.\n删除3：<u>Fig. 2.2\n\n【51】Exclusively oral stage or transfer\n</u>\nBoth stages (oral preparative and transfer) are conscious and voluntary and affect proper dentoalveolar growth and development.\n\n【52】#### 2.1.3.3 Pharyngeal Stage\n\n【53】When the food reaches the oropharyngeal isthmus, the swallowing reflex is initiated. This includes  elevation and retraction of the soft palate; in order to contact the posterior and lateral soft pharynx, the isthmus faucium closes. Elevation and closing of the larynx to stop food from moving into the airway and relaxation of the superior esophageal valve is necessary.\n\n【54】This stage is crucial to stop the bolus from being regurgitated by the nose, returning to the mouth, or moving into the airway.\n\n【55】The sequence of motions during this pharyngeal phase pushes the bolus back and the intraoral pressure increases. This takes seconds and it is conscious and involuntary. At this point, respiratory apnea is produced (Segovia).\n删除3：<u>Fig. 2.3</u>\n\n<mark>【56】Pharyngeal stage</mark>\n\n【57】#### 2.1.3.4 Esophageal Stage\n\n【58】This stage starts when food moves through the superior esophageal sphincter and ends when it moves into the inferior esophageal sphincter .\n\n【59】This is unconscious and involuntary. It takes 8–20 s.\n删除3：<u>Fig. 2.4</u>\n\n【60】Esophageal stage\n\n【61】#### 2.1.3.5 Dysfunctional Swallowing or Tongue Thrusting\n\n【62】It is the malposition of the tongue, at rest and while swallowing. This dysfunction of the tongue affects the growth and development of the mouth. When it isn’t treated and continues, it is considered among the most common etiological factors that produce maxillofacial disharmony. It can also worsen and produce malocclusion, bearing in mind that proper function is not possible if the shape is not adequate. One way or another, dysfunction of the tongue must be taken into account and treated.\n\n【63】High position of the tongue (anterior open bite) .\n删除3：<u>Fig. 2.5\n\n【64】( a ) High position of the tongue. ( b ) Poor tongue position at rest. ( c ) Anterior open bite. ( d ) Dysfunctional swallowing\n</u>\nIn general this malposition of the tongue exerts pressure on the premaxilla, causing an open bite. Another situation is dysfunctional swallowing and low tongue thrust as a consequence of hypertrophied tonsils .\n删除3：<u>Fig. 2.6\n\n【65】( a ) Poor facial muscle balance. ( b ) Low tongue thrust.

( b ) Lingual dysfunction during smile. ( c ) Altered tooth relationship. ( d ) Dysfunctional swallowing with tongue thrust\n</u>\nOther patients have dysfunctional swallowing with lip interposition .\n\n【67】It is an orofacial neuromuscular imbalance that is characterized by constant lip interposition while swallowing at rest, while pronouncing bilabial P B M, and during mimic. This interposition is harmful for harmonious maxillofacial growth and development. Many call it the lip trap. This dysfunction of the lip is sometimes accompanied by tongue thrust, thus affecting the dental-maxillary relation even more.\n删除3：<u>Fig. 2.8\n\n【68】( a ) Usual position at rest.

They do not usually occur on the first encounter with the antigen， but a second or subsequent exposure of a sensitized individual causes an allergic reaction. Allergic symptoms will depend on the type of antigen， the route by which it enters the body， and the cells involved in the immune response. These unwanted responses can cause distressing symptoms， tissue damage， and even death. These are the same reactions that would be provoked by a pathogenic antigen， had it been introduced and presented in the same way. When they are not helping to combat an infection， however， these damaging side-effects are clearly unwanted.\n\n【2】There are four main types of immunological hypersensitivity reactions， which are distinguished by the type of immune cells and antibodies involved， and the pathologies produced. The one discussed here is an example of a type Ⅳ (delayed hypersensitivity) reaction . Many allergic reactions occur within minutes or a few hours of encounter with the antigen， but some take a day or two to appear.Thelatter are the delayed hypersensitivity reactions. Delayed hypersen-sitivity reactions are mediated by T cells only， either TH1 CD4 T cells or cytotoxic CD8T cells， or sometimes both. Antibodies are not involved. The reactions can be triggered by foreign proteins or by self-proteins that have become modified by the attachment of a hapten， such as a small organic molecule or metal ion. A common type of delayed hypersensitivity reaction is allergic contact dermatitis， a skin rash caused by direct contact with the antigen.\n删除3：<u>Fig. 49.1 Type IV hypersensitivity reactions. There are four types of immune-mediated tissue damage. Types I-ill are antibody-mediated and are distinguished by the different types of antigens recognized and the different classes of antibodies involved. We have seen examples of type I responses in Case 47 and of type Ill in Case 48. Type Ⅳhypersensitivity reactions are T cell-mediated and can be subdivided into two classes. In the first class， tissue damage is caused by TH1 cells， which activate macrophages， leading to an inflammatory response. On encounter with antigen， effector TH1 cells secrete cytokines such as interferon-y， that activate macrophages and， to a lesser extent， mast cells， to release cytokines and inflammatory mediators that cause the symptoms. In the second class of type l reactions， damage is caused directly by cytotoxic Tlymphocytes (CTLs) that attack tissue cells presenting the sensitizing antigen on their surface. The delay in the appearance of a type l hypersensitivity reaction is due to the time it takes to recruit antigen-specific T cells and other cells to the site of antigen localization and to develop the inflammatory response. Because a delayed hypersensitivity response involves antigen processing and presentation to achieve T-cell activation， quite large amounts of antigen need to be present at the site of contact. The amount of antigen required is two or three orders of magnitude greater than that required to initiate an antibody-mediated immediate hypersensitivity reaction.</u>\n\n【3】Delayed hypersensitivity reactions fall into two classes . In the first， the damage is due to an inflammatory response and tissue destruction by THl cells and the macrophages they activate. In the second class of delayed hypersensitivity reactions， tissue damage is caused mainly by the direct action of antigen-specific cytotoxic CD8 T cells on target cells displaying the foreign antigen. Some antigens may cause a combination of both types of reactions.\n\n【4】This case describes the most frequently encountered delayed hypersensitivity reaction in the United States： allergic contact dermatitis due to the woodland plant poison ivy.\n删除3：<u>Fig. 49.2 The time course of a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction. The first phase involves the uptake， processing， and presentation of the antigen by local antigen-presenting cells. In the second phase， TH1 cells that were primed by a previous exposure to the antigen migrate into the site of injection and become activated. Because these specific cells are rare， and because there is no inflammation to attract cells into the site， it may take several hours for a T cell of the correct specificity to arrive. These cells release mediators that activate local endothelial cells， recruiting an inflammatory cell infiltrate dominated by macrophages and causing the accumulation of fluid and protein. At this point， the lesion becomes apparent.</u>\n\n【5】Paul Stein was 7 years old and had enjoyed perfect health until 2 days after he returned from a hike with his summer camp group， when itchy red skin eruptions appeared all along his right arm. Within a day or two， the rash had spread to his trunk， face， and genitals. His mother gave him the antihistamine Benadryl (diphen-hydramine hydrochloride) orally to suppress the itching， but this gave only partial relief. The rash did not improve， and a week after it first appeared he attended the Dermatology Clinic at the Children's Hospital.\n\n【6】Physical examination revealed large patches of raised， red， elongated blisters， ooz-ing scant clear fluid， on his body and extremities . Paul also had swollen eyelids and a swollen penis. There was no history of fever， fatigue， or any other symptom.A contact sensitivity reaction to poison ivy was diagnosed.\n\n【7】He was given a corticosteroid-containing cream to apply to the skin lesions three times a day， and Benadryl to take orally three times a day. He was asked to shampoo his hair， wash his body thoroughly with soap and water， and cut his nails short.\n\n【8】Two days later， his parents reported that， although no new eruptions had appeared， the old lesions were not significantly better. Paul was then given the corticosteroid prednisone orally， which was gradually decreased over a period of 2 weeks. The topical steroid cream was discontinued.\n\n【9】Within a week， the rash had almost disappeared. Upon stopping the prednisone there was a mild flare-up of some lesions， and this was controlled by application of topical steroid for a few days. Paul was shown how to identify poison ivy in order to avoid further contact with it， and told to wear long pants and shirts with long sleeves on any future hikes in the woods.\n\n【10】Contact sensitivity to poison ivy.\n\n【11】The reaction to poison ivy is the most commonly seen delayed hypersensitivity reaction in those parts ofthe United States where the plant grows wild. The absence of fever or general malaise accompanying the rash， and Paul’s otherwise excellent health except for the skin lesions， point to a contact sensitivity reaction rather than to a viral or bacterial infection or some other underlying long-term illness. The appearance of the rash just 2 days after Paul returned from a hiking trip where he could easily have been in contact with poison ivy virtually clinches the diagnosis.\n\n【12】Allergic contact dermatitis due to poison ivy is caused by a T-cell response to a chemical in theleaf called pentadecacatechol . On contact with the skin， this small， highly reactive， lipid-like molecule penetrates the outer layers， and binds covalently and nonspecifically to proteins on the surfaces of skin cells， in which form it functions as a hapten. Most people are susceptible， and sensitivity， once acquired， is life-long.\n\n【13】The generation of a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction requires the completion of both an ‘afferent and an efferent response. In the afferent part of the response， the hapten enters the epidermis， and haptenated self proteins are ingested by specialized phagocytic cells in the epidermis (Langerhans cells) and dermis (den-dritic cells) into intracellular vesicles， where they are cleaved into peptides. Some of these peptides will have hapten attached. The peptides bind to MHC class II molecules in the vesicles and are presented as peptide：MHC complexes on the Langerhans cell surface. Over the next 12-48 hours， some ofthese Langerhans cells and dermal dendritic cells migrate to a regional lymph node， where they become\n删除3：<u>Fig. 49.3 Blistering skin lesions of patient with poison ivy contact dermatitis. Note the linear pattern of blisters in several areas. This is called the Koebner phenomenon and is due to exposure to the hapten along a line， possibly due to initial wiping or scratchingg. A rash only occurs on the initial areas of skin contact. Once the hapten is cleaned from the skin， no additional areas of skin will become involved. Therefore， touching skin lesions or blister fluid will not result in additional spread.</u>\n删除3：<u>Fig. 49.4 The chemical formula of pentadecacatechol， the causative agent of contact sensitivity to poison ivy.</u>\n删除3：<u>Fig. 49.5 The delayed-type (type IV) hypersensitivity response is directed by cytokines released by TH1 cells stimulated by antigen. Antigen in the local tissues is processed by antigen-presenting cells and presented on MHC class Il molecules. Antigen-specific TH1cells can recognize the antigen locally at the site of injection， and release chemokines and cytokines that recruit macrophages to the site of antigen deposition. Antigen presentation by the newly recruited macrophages then amplifies the response. T cells may also affect local blood vessels through the release of TNF-a and LT (lymphotoxin) and stimulate the production of macrophages through the release of IL-3and GM-CSF (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor). Finally， TH1cells activate macrophages through the release of IFN-y， and kill macrophages and other sensitive cells through the release of LT or by the expression of Fas ligand.</u>\n\n【14】antigen-presenting cells that can activate naive hapten-specific T cells to become recirculating hapten-specific effector CD4 THl cells and effector cytotoxic CD8 T cells that express skin-homing receptors such as E-selectin and CCR4. The effer-ent part of the response involves homing by these sensitized THl and cytotoxic T cells to the site of contact with the plant. There， the activated effector T cell can react with haptenated peptides presented by Langerhans cells and dermal den-dritic cells， leading to a release of inflammatory mediators by the Th1 cells and cytotoxic molecules， such as perforin， by the cytotoxic T cells， thereby initiating a local delayed hypersensitivity reaction in the skin. With each subsequent exposure to antigen， the period oflatency from contact to appearance of a rash is shortened(anamnesis)\n\n【15】The appearance of Paul’s rash 2 days after his suspected exposure to poison ivy is typical of a delayed hypersensitivity reaction. The haptenated self peptides pre-sented on skin macrophages and Langerhans cells at the site of contact with poi-son ivy are initially recognized by the small number of activated hapten-specific THl cells within the pool of recirculating T cells. On encounter with the haptenated peptides， these THl cells release chemokines， cytokines， and cytotoxins that initi-ate an inflammatory reaction and also kill cells directly .\n\n【16】One of the cytokines produced by the Thl cells is interferon-y (IFN-Y)， whose main effect in this context is to activate macrophages. The subsequent macrophage activity causes many of the symptoms of the delayed hypersensitivity reaction. Macrophages activated by IFN-y release cytokines and inflammatory mediators such as interleukins， prostaglandins， nitric oxide (NO)， and leukotrienes. The combined effects of T-cell and macrophage activity cause a local inflammatory response and tissue damage at the site of the contact with poison ivy.\n\n【17】The red， raised， blistering skin lesions of poison ivy dermatitis are due to the infil-tration of large numbers of blood cells into the tissue at the site of contact， com-bined with the localized death oftissue cells and the destruction of the extracellular matrix that holds the layers of skin together. One of the first actions of effector TH1cells on contact with their antigen is to release the cytokines TNF-a and LT (lym-photoxin)， and chemokines such as CCL5 (formerly known as RANTES). TNF-c in particular increases the expression of adhesion molecules on the endothelium lin-ing postcapillary venules and increases vascular permeability so that macrophages and other leukocytes adhere to the sides of the blood vessel. This aids their migra-tion from the bloodstream into the tissues in response to the secreted chemokines.\n\n【18】Once at the contact site， macrophages are activated and themselves release cytokines and other inflammatory mediators， which attract more monocytes， T cells， and other leukocytes to the site， thus helping to amplify and maintain the inflammatory reaction. The blood vessels also dilate， which causes the redness associated with the rash. The inflammatory mediators also act on mast cells to cause degranulation and the release of histamine， which is the main cause of the itching that accompanies the reaction.\n\n【19】Tissue destruction， which is a feature of delayed hypersensitivity reactions， is caused both by cytokines and by direct cell-cell interactions. The TNF-a and LT released by THl cells and macrophages act at the same TNF receptors， which are expressed on virtually all types of cells， including skin cells. Stimulation of these receptors induces a \"suicide' pathway in the cells-apoptosis-which causes their death. Activated CD4\\ T cells also express the Fas ligand (FasL) in their plasma membrane， which interacts with the ubiquitously expressed cell-surface molecule Fas to cause the death of the target cell by apoptosis. Other mediators released by activated T cells， such as the enzyme stromelysin， degrade the proteins of the extra-cellular matrix， which maintain the integrity of the skin.\n\n【20】Lipid-like haptens such as pentadecacatechol can also cause the priming and acti-vation of cytotoxic CD8 T cells， as small fat-soluble molecules can enter the cyto-sol of skin cells directly by diffusing through the plasma membrane. Once inside， pentadecacatechol binds to intracellular proteins. Peptides generated from the 删除换行 haptenated proteins in the cytosol are delivered to the cell surface associated with MHC class I molecules. These target cells are recognized and attacked by antigen-specific cytotoxic CD8 T cells， which have become primed and activated on a pre-vious encounter with the antigen. The outcome of all these reactions is the raised， red， weeping blisters characteristic of sensitivity to poison ivy.\n\n【21】Corticosteroids are the standard treatment for hapten-mediated contact sensitiv-ity， because they inhibit the inflammatory response by inhibiting the production of many of the cytokines and chemokines. Corticosteroids are lipid-like mole-cules that can diffuse freely across plasma membranes. Once inside the cell， they bind to receptor proteins in the cytoplasm. The receptor：steroid complex enters the nucleus， where it controls the expression of several genes. Of relevance here is the fact that it induces the production of an inhibitor of the transcription fac-tors required to switch on transcription of the cytokine and chemokine genes. In mild cases of poison ivy dermatitis， topical steroids applied locally are sufficient. In more severe cases such as Paul's， oral steroids are needed to achieve a concen-tration necessary to inhibit the inflammatory response. Paul was given antihista-mines to block the histamine receptors and counteract the action of the histamine released from mast cells，", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【14】antigen-presenting cells ", "content": "【0】CASE 49\n\n【1】Allergic or hypersensitivity reactions can be elicited by antigens that are not asso-ciated with infectious agents， for example pollen， dust， food， and chemicals in the environment. They do not usually occur on the first encounter with the antigen， but a second or subsequent exposure of a sensitized individual causes an allergic reaction. Allergic symptoms will depend on the type of antigen， the route by which it enters the body， and the cells involved in the immune response. These unwanted responses can cause distressing symptoms， tissue damage， and even death. These are the same reactions that would be provoked by a pathogenic antigen， had it been introduced and presented in the same way. When they are not helping to combat an infection， however， these damaging side-effects are clearly unwanted.\n\n【2】There are four main types of immunological hypersensitivity reactions， which are distinguished by the type of immune cells and antibodies involved， and the pathologies produced. The one discussed here is an example of a type Ⅳ (delayed hypersensitivity) reaction . Many allergic reactions occur within minutes or a few hours of encounter with the antigen， but some take a day or two to appear.Thelatter are the delayed hypersensitivity reactions. Delayed hypersen-sitivity reactions are mediated by T cells only， either TH1 CD4 T cells or cytotoxic CD8T cells， or sometimes both. Antibodies are not involved. The reactions can be triggered by foreign proteins or by self-proteins that have become modified by the attachment of a hapten， such as a small organic molecule or metal ion. A common type of delayed hypersensitivity reaction is allergic contact dermatitis， a skin rash caused by direct contact with the antigen.\n删除3：<u>Fig. 49.1 Type IV hypersensitivity reactions. There are four types of immune-mediated tissue damage. Types I-ill are antibody-mediated and are distinguished by the different types of antigens recognized and the different classes of antibodies involved. We have seen examples of type I responses in Case 47 and of type Ill in Case 48. Type Ⅳhypersensitivity reactions are T cell-mediated and can be subdivided into two classes. In the first class， tissue damage is caused by TH1 cells， which activate macrophages， leading to an inflammatory response. On encounter with antigen， effector TH1 cells secrete cytokines such as interferon-y， that activate macrophages and， to a lesser extent， mast cells， to release cytokines and inflammatory mediators that cause the symptoms. In the second class of type l reactions， damage is caused directly by cytotoxic Tlymphocytes (CTLs) that attack tissue cells presenting the sensitizing antigen on their surface. The delay in the appearance of a type l hypersensitivity reaction is due to the time it takes to recruit antigen-specific T cells and other cells to the site of antigen localization and to develop the inflammatory response. Because a delayed hypersensitivity response involves antigen processing and presentation to achieve T-cell activation， quite large amounts of antigen need to be present at the site of contact. The amount of antigen required is two or three orders of magnitude greater than that required to initiate an antibody-mediated immediate hypersensitivity reaction.</u>\n\n【3】Delayed hypersensitivity reactions fall into two classes . In the first， the damage is due to an inflammatory response and tissue destruction by THl cells and the macrophages they activate. In the second class of delayed hypersensitivity reactions， tissue damage is caused mainly by the direct action of antigen-specific cytotoxic CD8 T cells on target cells displaying the foreign antigen. Some antigens may cause a combination of both types of reactions.\n\n【4】This case describes the most frequently encountered delayed hypersensitivity reaction in the United States： allergic contact dermatitis due to the woodland plant poison ivy.\n删除3：<u>Fig. 49.2 The time course of a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction. The first phase involves the uptake， processing， and presentation of the antigen by local antigen-presenting cells. In the second phase， TH1 cells that were primed by a previous exposure to the antigen migrate into the site of injection and become activated. Because these specific cells are rare， and because there is no inflammation to attract cells into the site， it may take several hours for a T cell of the correct specificity to arrive. These cells release mediators that activate local endothelial cells， recruiting an inflammatory cell infiltrate dominated by macrophages and causing the accumulation of fluid and protein. At this point， the lesion becomes apparent.</u>\n\n【5】Paul Stein was 7 years old and had enjoyed perfect health until 2 days after he returned from a hike with his summer camp group， when itchy red skin eruptions appeared all along his right arm. Within a day or two， the rash had spread to his trunk， face， and genitals. His mother gave him the antihistamine Benadryl (diphen-hydramine hydrochloride) orally to suppress the itching， but this gave only partial relief. The rash did not improve， and a week after it first appeared he attended the Dermatology Clinic at the Children's Hospital.\n\n【6】Physical examination revealed large patches of raised， red， elongated blisters， ooz-ing scant clear fluid， on his body and extremities . Paul also had swollen eyelids and a swollen penis. There was no history of fever， fatigue， or any other symptom.A contact sensitivity reaction to poison ivy was diagnosed.\n\n【7】He was given a corticosteroid-containing cream to apply to the skin lesions three times a day， and Benadryl to take orally three times a day. He was asked to shampoo his hair， wash his body thoroughly with soap and water， and cut his nails short.\n\n【8】Two days later， his parents reported that， although no new eruptions had appeared， the old lesions were not significantly better. Paul was then given the corticosteroid prednisone orally， which was gradually decreased over a period of 2 weeks. The topical steroid cream was discontinued.\n\n【9】Within a week， the rash had almost disappeared. Upon stopping the prednisone there was a mild flare-up of some lesions， and this was controlled by application of topical steroid for a few days. Paul was shown how to identify poison ivy in order to avoid further contact with it， and told to wear long pants and shirts with long sleeves on any future hikes in the woods.\n\n【10】Contact sensitivity to poison ivy.\n\n【11】The reaction to poison ivy is the most commonly seen delayed hypersensitivity reaction in those parts ofthe United States where the plant grows wild. The absence of fever or general malaise accompanying the rash， and Paul’s otherwise excellent health except for the skin lesions， point to a contact sensitivity reaction rather than to a viral or bacterial infection or some other underlying long-term illness. The appearance of the rash just 2 days after Paul returned from a hiking trip where he could easily have been in contact with poison ivy virtually clinches the diagnosis.\n\n【12】Allergic contact dermatitis due to poison ivy is caused by a T-cell response to a chemical in theleaf called pentadecacatechol . On contact with the skin， this small， highly reactive， lipid-like molecule penetrates the outer layers， and binds covalently and nonspecifically to proteins on the surfaces of skin cells， in which form it functions as a hapten. Most people are susceptible， and sensitivity， once acquired， is life-long.\n\n【13】The generation of a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction requires the completion of both an ‘afferent and an efferent response. In the afferent part of the response， the hapten enters the epidermis， and haptenated self proteins are ingested by specialized phagocytic cells in the epidermis (Langerhans cells) and dermis (den-dritic cells) into intracellular vesicles， where they are cleaved into peptides. Some of these peptides will have hapten attached. The peptides bind to MHC class II molecules in the vesicles and are presented as peptide：MHC complexes on the Langerhans cell surface. Over the next 12-48 hours， some ofthese Langerhans cells and dermal dendritic cells migrate to a regional lymph node， where they become\n删除3：<u>Fig. 49.3 Blistering skin lesions of patient with poison ivy contact dermatitis. Note the linear pattern of blisters in several areas. This is called the Koebner phenomenon and is due to exposure to the hapten along a line， possibly due to initial wiping or scratchingg. A rash only occurs on the initial areas of skin contact. Once the hapten is cleaned from the skin， no additional areas of skin will become involved. Therefore， touching skin lesions or blister fluid will not result in additional spread.</u>\n删除3：<u>Fig. 49.4 The chemical formula of pentadecacatechol， the causative agent of contact sensitivity to poison ivy.</u>\n删除3：<u>Fig. 49.5 The delayed-type (type IV) hypersensitivity response is directed by cytokines released by TH1 cells stimulated by antigen. Antigen in the local tissues is processed by antigen-presenting cells and presented on MHC class Il molecules. Antigen-specific TH1cells can recognize the antigen locally at the site of injection， and release chemokines and cytokines that recruit macrophages to the site of antigen deposition. Antigen presentation by the newly recruited macrophages then amplifies the response. T cells may also affect local blood vessels through the release of TNF-a and LT (lymphotoxin) and stimulate the production of macrophages through the release of IL-3and GM-CSF (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor). Finally， TH1cells activate macrophages through the release of IFN-y， and kill macrophages and other sensitive cells through the release of LT or by the expression of Fas ligand.</u>\n\n【14】antigen-presenting cells that can activate naive hapten-specific T cells to become recirculating hapten-specific effector CD4 THl cells and effector cytotoxic CD8 T cells that express skin-homing receptors such as E-selectin and CCR4. The effer-ent part of the response involves homing by these sensitized THl and cytotoxic T cells to the site of contact with the plant. There， the activated effector T cell can react with haptenated peptides presented by Langerhans cells and dermal den-dritic cells， leading to a release of inflammatory mediators by the Th1 cells and cytotoxic molecules， such as perforin， by the cytotoxic T cells， thereby initiating a local delayed hypersensitivity reaction in the skin. With each subsequent exposure to antigen， the period oflatency from contact to appearance of a rash is shortened(anamnesis)\n\n【15】The appearance of Paul’s rash 2 days after his suspected exposure to poison ivy is typical of a delayed hypersensitivity reaction. The haptenated self peptides pre-sented on skin macrophages and Langerhans cells at the site of contact with poi-son ivy are initially recognized by the small number of activated hapten-specific THl cells within the pool of recirculating T cells. On encounter with the haptenated peptides， these THl cells release chemokines， cytokines， and cytotoxins that initi-ate an inflammatory reaction and also kill cells directly .\n\n【16】One of the cytokines produced by the Thl cells is interferon-y (IFN-Y)， whose main effect in this context is to activate macrophages. The subsequent macrophage activity causes many of the symptoms of the delayed hypersensitivity reaction. Macrophages activated by IFN-y release cytokines and inflammatory mediators such as interleukins， prostaglandins， nitric oxide (NO)， and leukotrienes. The combined effects of T-cell and macrophage activity cause a local inflammatory response and tissue damage at the site of the contact with poison ivy.\n\n【17】The red， raised， blistering skin lesions of poison ivy dermatitis are due to the infil-tration of large numbers of blood cells into the tissue at the site of contact， com-bined with the localized death oftissue cells and the destruction of the extracellular matrix that holds the layers of skin together. One of the first actions of effector TH1cells on contact with their antigen is to release the cytokines TNF-a and LT (lym-photoxin)， and chemokines such as CCL5 (formerly known as RANTES). TNF-c in particular increases the expression of adhesion molecules on the endothelium lin-ing postcapillary venules and increases vascular permeability so that macrophages and other leukocytes adhere to the sides of the blood vessel. This aids their migra-tion from the bloodstream into the tissues in response to the secreted chemokines.\n\n【18】Once at the contact site， macrophages are activated and themselves release cytokines and other inflammatory mediators， which attract more monocytes， T cells， and other leukocytes to the site， thus helping to amplify and maintain the inflammatory reaction. The blood vessels also dilate， which causes the redness associated with the rash. The inflammatory mediators also act on mast cells to cause degranulation and the release of histamine， which is the main cause of the itching that accompanies the reaction.\n\n【19】Tissue destruction， which is a feature of delayed hypersensitivity reactions， is caused both by cytokines and by direct cell-cell interactions. The TNF-a and LT released by THl cells and macrophages act at the same TNF receptors， which are expressed on virtually all types of cells， including skin cells. Stimulation of these receptors induces a \"suicide' pathway in the cells-apoptosis-which causes their death. Activated CD4\\ T cells also express the Fas ligand (FasL) in their plasma membrane， which interacts with the ubiquitously expressed cell-surface molecule Fas to cause the death of the target cell by apoptosis. Other mediators released by activated T cells， such as the enzyme stromelysin， degrade the proteins of the extra-cellular matrix， which maintain the integrity of the skin.\n\n【20】Lipid-like haptens such as pentadecacatechol can also cause the priming and acti-vation of cytotoxic CD8 T cells， as small fat-soluble molecules can enter the cyto-sol of skin cells directly by diffusing through the plasma membrane. Once inside， pentadecacatechol binds to intracellular proteins. Peptides generated from the 删除换行 haptenated proteins in the cytosol are delivered to the cell surface associated with MHC class I molecules. These target cells are recognized and attacked by antigen-specific cytotoxic CD8 T cells， which have become primed and activated on a pre-vious encounter with the antigen. The outcome of all these reactions is the raised， red， weeping blisters characteristic of sensitivity to poison ivy.\n\n【21】Corticosteroids are the standard treatment for hapten-mediated contact sensitiv-ity， because they inhibit the inflammatory response by inhibiting the production of many of the cytokines and chemokines. Corticosteroids are lipid-like mole-cules that can diffuse freely across plasma membranes. Once inside the cell， they bind to receptor proteins in the cytoplasm.

Class I hemorrhagic shock is well compensated associated with 750 mL EBL or less， with no effect on blood pressure and minimal effect on heart rate. Class II shock， associated with 750 to 1500 mL EBL， is associated with tachycardia but normal blood pressure at rest， and low urine output.\n\n【20】7.2 B. DPL andFAST cannot rule out retroperitoneal injury or identify the specific site of injury， but they can be performed quickly at bedside on unstable trauma patients. To find the specific site of injury and rule out retroperitoneal injury， a CT scan can be done； however， the trauma patient must be hemodynamically stable to be transported to the CT scan suite.\n\n【21】7.3 A. In situations of trauma and hemorrhage， persistent hypotension is caused by blood loss unless otherwise proven. Hypotension is caused by lack of preload. Preload is end-diastolic sarcomere length， and insufficient circulating volume does not allow for suffcient venous return or cardiac output.\n\n【22】7.4 D. It is important to systematically check for bleeding sources in the chest， abdomen， pelvic girdle， soft-tissue compartments (long-bone fractures)， and external bleeding. Intracranial bleeding， although a significant injury， is usually not the cause of hypotension.

Foul-smelling cloudy peritoneal fluid is collected. Subsequent analysis reveals the growth of black-pigmented colonies on Bacteroides bile esculin agar. No growth is detected in the presence of kanamycin, colistin, or vancomycin. Which of the following microorganisms is most likely involved in this case?\n\n【1】A. Actinomyces israelii\n\n【2】B. Bacteroides fragilis\n\n【3】C. Clostridium difficile\n\n【4】D. Enterococcus faecalis\n\n【5】E. Porphyromonas gingivalis\n\n【6】F. Prevotella melaninogenica\n\n【7】Answer: 2.1 B. Bacteroides species are normal inhabitants of the bowel and other sites. Normal stools contain large numbers of B. fragilis (10 <sup>11 </sup> organisms per gram). As a result, they are very important anaerobes that can cause human infection. Members of the B. fragilis group are most commonly isolated from infections associated with contamination by the contents of the colon, where they may cause suppuration (eg, peritonitis following bowel injury). Classification is based on colonial and biochemical features and on characteristic short-chain fatty acid patterns in gas chromatography. These short-chain fatty acids also contribute to the foul-smelling odor emanating from the wound in the above case.\n\n【8】Question: 2.2 Which of the following is the treatment of choice to control this infection in this patient (described in Question 2.1)?\n\n【9】A. Cephalothin\n\n【10】B. Erythromycin\n\n【11】C. Metronidazole\n\n【12】D. Penicillin\n\n【13】Answer: 2.2 C. Metronidazole, mainly used as an antiprotozoal agent, is also highly effective against anaerobic bacterial infections, such as those infections caused by Bacteroides species. It is the drug of first choice for GI strains of Bacteroides . Two other effective antibiotics are imipenem and piperacillin/tazobactam. Bacteroides species, such as B. fragili s , commonly possessβ-lactamase activity, resulting in resistance to penicillin and cephalosporin (eg, cephalothin) antibiotics. Erythromycin is not indicated in the treatment of Bacteroides species.\n\n【14】Question: 2.3 A 38-year-old man is admitted to the hospital due to abdominal pain, fever, and decreased appetite. Computed tomography imaging shows a fluid collection in the right lower quadrant. Surgery reveals an appendiceal abscess. Cultures grow B. fragilis . Among the many virulence factors produced, B. fragilis produces an enzyme that allows the organism to survive in the presence of small amounts of oxygen. Which of the enzymes listed below catalyzes the following reaction?\n\n【15】A. β-Lactamase\n\n【16】B. Myeloperoxidase\n\n【17】C. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase\n\n【18】D. NO synthase\n\n【19】E. Oxidase\n\n【20】F. Superoxide dismutase\n\n【21】Answer: 2.3 F. A key feature of obligate anaerobes such as Clostridium, Bacteroides , and Actinomyces is that they lack catalase and/or super-oxide dismutase (SOD) and are therefore susceptible to oxidative damage. However, Bacteroides fragilis can survive (not grow) in environments with low oxygen content because of its ability to produce small amounts of both SOD and catalase. Anaerobes that possess SOD, catalase, or both can negate the toxic effects of oxygen radicals and hydrogen peroxide and thus tolerate oxygen. Other common enzymes listed above catalyze the following reactions:\n\n【22】Question: 2.4 A foul-smelling specimen was obtained from a 26-year-old woman with a pelvic abscess. Culture grew both aerobic and anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. The most likely organisms are which of the following?\n\n【23】A. Actinomyces israelii and Escherichia coli\n\n【24】B. Bacteroides fragilis and Listeria monocytogenes\n\n【25】C. Bacteroides fragilis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae\n\n【26】D. Clostridium perfringens and Bacteroides fragilis\n\n【27】E. Escherichia coli and Peptostreptococcus\nAnswer: 2.4 C. In infections, such as intra-abdominal abscesses, Bacteroides species are often associated with other organisms. The only other organism in the list above that is solely aerobic and gram negative is N. gonorrhoeae . Both Clostridium and Listeria are gram positive. E. coli is gram negative and a facultative anaerobe.\n\n【28】MICROBIOLOGY PEARLS\n\n【29】 The treatment of choice of B. fragilis is surgical debridement in addition to metronidazole, imipenem, or piperacillin/tazobactam.\n\n【30】 Most anaerobes are part of mixed infections at mucosal surfaces.\n\n【31】 Bacteroides fragilis is the most common anaerobe in the human GI tract.\n\n【32】 Bacteroides fragilis usually expresses superoxide dismutase, an enzyme, which allows the organism to survive in the presence of small amounts of oxygen.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 11:21:51", "endTime": "2024/09/12 11:22:12", "cost": 21.012}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:28", "update_time": "2024-09-11 19:22:13", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 19:21:51"}

Be familiar with geriatric health maintenance.\n\n【5】2\\. Be aware of the importance of geriatric screening.The patient described in this case is a 75-year-old man who has difficulty with speech discrimination and complains of difficulty understanding speech and con-versation in noisy areas. He most likely has presbycusis， which is an age-related sensorineural hearing loss typically associated with both selective high-frequency loss and difficulty with speech discrimination. Physical examination of the ears in patients with presbycusis is normal. Other conditions in the differential diagnosis include cerumen impaction， otosclerosis， and central auditory processing disorder. Cerumen impaction and otosclerosis can be diagnosed by otoscopy. Central audi-tory processing disorder is diagnosed when the patient can hear sounds without difficulty， but has difficulty in understanding spoken words.By the year 2030， the number of people aged 65 and older is expected to double from what it was in 1999， increasing from 34 to 69 million. Geriatric health main-tenance provides screening and therapy with the goal of enhancing function and preserving health in the elderly. Screening is not indicated unless early therapy for the screened condition is more effective than late therapy or no therapy. Preventive services for the elderly include as goals the optimization of quality of life， satisfaction with life， and maintenance of independence and productivity. Most recommenda-tions for patients older than age 65 overlap with recommendations for the general adult population. Certain categories are unique to older patients， including sensory perception and fall. The primary care physician can perform effective health screen-ing using simple and relatively easily administered assessment tools .Functional assessment gauges a patient's ability to manage tasks of self-care，house-hold management， and mobility. Impairment in activities of daily living (ADL) results in an increased risk of falls， hip fracture， depression， and institutionaliza-tion. An estimated 25% of patients older than 65 years have impairments in theirFigure 18-1. Approach to geriatric health maintenance.

Persons who are unable to perform IADL independently are far more likely to have dementia than their independent counterparts.Cataract is any opacification of the lens. Age-related， or senile， cataracts account for 90% of all cataracts. Cataract disease is the most common cause of blindness worldwide. The definitive treatment for cataracts is surgery. Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in working-age adults in the United States. It is important to consider diabetic retinopathy in geriatric vision screening.More than one-third of persons older than age 65 and half of those older than age 85 have some hearing loss. This deficit is correlated with social isolation and depression. The whispered voice test has sensitivities and specificities ranging from70% to 100%. The initial office screening for general hearing loss can be reliably performed with questionnaire such as the HHIE-S (Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly). Limited office-based pure-tone audiometry is more accurate in identifying patients who would benefit from a more formal audiometry.\n\n【8】The majority of patients with hearing impairment will present with complaints unrelated to their sensory deficit. In a quiet examination room with face-to-face conversation， patients can overcome significant hearing loss and avoid detection from a physician. Family members are often more concerned about the hearing loss than the patient. Common causes of geriatric hearing impairments are presbycu-sis， noise-induced hearing loss， cerumen impaction， otosclerosis， and central auditory processing disorder. Presbycusis is age-related sensorineural hearing loss usually associated with both selective high-frequency loss and difficulty with speech dis-crimination. Presbycusis is the most common form of hearing loss in the elderly. Because it often goes unrecognized， exact prevalence data are lacking. Presbycu-sis is a diagnosis of exclusion. Complete deafness is not an expected end result of presbycusis.Noise-induced hearing loss is essentially a wear and tear phenomenon that can occur with either industrial or recreational noise exposure. Patients will typically present with tinnitus， difficulty with speech discrimination， and problems hearing background noise. Cerumen impaction in the external auditory canal is a common， frequently overlooked problem in the elderly that may produce a tran-sient， mild conductive hearing loss. It is estimated that 25% to 35% of institution-alized or hospitalized elderly are affected by impacted cerumen. Otosclerosis is an autosomal dominant disorder of the bones in the inner ear. It results in progres-sive conductive hearing loss with onset most commonly in the late twenties to the early forties. Speech discrimination is typically preserved. Geriatric patients with hearing loss may have otosclerosis complicating their presentation. Central audi-tory processing disorder (CAPD) is the general term for conditions involving hear-ing impairment that results from central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction. The patient with CAPD will have difficulty understanding spoken language， but may be able to hear sounds well.Falls are the leading cause of nonfatal injuries in the elderly. The associated com-plications are the leading cause of death from injury in those older than age 65. Hip fractures are common precursors to functional impairment and nursing home placement. Approximately 30%of the noninstitutionalized elderly fall each year.The annual incidence of falls approaches 50% in patients older than 80 years. Factors contributing to falls include age-related postural changes， alterations in visual abil-ity， certain medications， and diseases affecting muscle strength and coordination. Due to the far-reaching consequences that falls have on both the patient and the health-care system， the American Geriatric Society recommends that physicians ask their elderly patients about history of falls and balance problems. Additionally， USPSTF recommends incorporation of exercise and physical therapy， including aerobic and strength training， as well as vitamin D supplementation to prevent falls.The prevalence of dementia doubles every 5 years after age 60， so that by age 85approximately 30%to 50%of individuals have some degree of impairment.Patients with mild or early dementia frequently remain undiagnosed because their social graces are retained. The combination of the “tlock draw”and the‘three-item recall”is a rapid and fairly reliable office-based screening for dementia. When patients fail either of these screening tests， further testing with the Folstein Mini-Mental State questionnaire should be performed.Incontinence in the elderly is common. Incontinence is estimated to affect 11% to34% of elderly men and 17% to 55% of elderly women. Continence problems are frequently treatable， have major social and emotional consequences， but are often not raised by patients as a concern.Depressive symptoms are more common in the elderly despite major depressive disorder being slightly lower in prevalence when compared with younger popu-lations. Unlike dementia， depression is usually treatable. Depression significantly increases morbidity and mortality， and is often overlooked by physicians. A simple two-question screen (Have you felt down/ depressed/ hopeless in the last 2 weeks? and Have you felt little interest or pleasure in doing things?) shows high sensitivity. Posi-tive responses can be followed up with a Geriatric Depression Scale， a 30-question instrument that is sensitive， specific， and reliable for the diagnosis of depression in the elderly.Approximately 15% of older outpatients and half of the hospitalized elderly are mal-nourished. A combination of serial weight measurements obtained in the office and inquiry about changing appetite is likely the most useful method of assessing nutri-tional status in the elderly. Adequate calcium intake for women is advised. Supple-mentation with a multivitamin formulated at about 100% daily value can decrease the prevalence of suboptimal vitamin status in older adults and improve their micro-nutrient status to levels associated with reduced risk for several chronic diseases. Malnutrition is common in nursing homes， and protein undernutrition has a preva-lence of 17% to 56% in this setting. Protein undernutrition is associated with an increased risk of infections， anemia， orthostatic hypotension， and decubitus ulcers.The incidence of stroke in older adults roughly doubles with each 10 years of age. The greatest risk factor is hypertension followed by atrial fibrillation. Anticoagula-tion with warfarin or newer agents， including dabigatran and apixaban， reduces the risk of strokes in people with atrial fibrillation. However， many elderly patients are not anticoagulated because of the fear of injuries from falls. In most instances，the benefits of anticoagulation are likely to outweigh the increased risk of fall-related bleeding， unless the patient has multiple falls， high-risk falls， or a very low risk of stroke. Aspirin use in women between the ages of 55 and 79 is recommended to decrease risk of ischemic stroke in a patient with no preexisting risk factors for gastrointestinal bleeding (USPSTF recommendation， Level A).Screening elderly men for prostate cancer is not routinely recommended， as it has not been definitively shown to prolong life and because of the risk of incontinence or erectile dysfunction caused by the treatments. An older woman should undergo annual mammography until her life expectancy falls below 5 to 10 years， although the USPSTF states that there is insu fficient evidence for or against screening in women over the age of 75. Screening for colon cancer is not generally recommended after the age of 75 although there may be some cases where it is appropriate (Level C) and is not recommended after the age of 85 (Level D). Screening for cervical cancer can be stopped in women older than 65 who have had adequate prior screening and are not at high risk for cervical cancer.The prevalence of low bone mineral density in the elderly is high， with osteope-nia found in 37% of postmenopausal women. Primary prevention of osteoporosis 删除换行 begins with identification of risk factors (older age， female gender， white or Asian race， low calcium intake， smoking， excessive alcohol use， and chronic glucocorticoid use). Calcium carbonate (500 mg three times daily) and vitamin D (400-800IU/d) reduce the risk of osteoporotic fractures in both men and women. Bone mineral density testing using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) of patients with multiple risk factors may uncover asymptomatic osteoporosis. USPSTF recom-mends osteoporosis screening for women of 65 years and older and those younger than 65 years with risk for fracture equal to or greater than a 65-year-old Caucasian woman with no risk factors besides age.Everyone over the age of 6 months should receive annual influenza vaccination. Persons older than age 65 should receive at least one pneumococcal immunization and a single booster dose of tetanus， diphtheria， and pertussis vaccine.

These types of films are often mobile examinations  删除换行 from intensive care (ITU) patients and can be complicated by rotation, poor inspiratory  删除换行 effort and an anterior–posterior (AP) projection. The commonest lines are discussed  删除换行 below, with chest drains discussed in a separate case; see Case 27.\n\n【10】• Endotracheal (ET) tubes: A patient is intubated for reasons of mechanical ventilation  删除换行 and airway protection usually because they are critically ill or undergoing anaesthe删除8：<u>￾</u>sia. Correct placement is critical and an ET tube is recognized on a chest radiograph  删除换行 as a linear opacity projected over the trachea in the midline. Insertion of an ET tube  删除换行 is beyond the scope of this book, but once in the trachea a radiolucent balloon cuff is  删除换行 inflated to maintain stability and a mechanical seal. The tubes are positioned blindly by  删除换行 an airway expert and a chest radiograph is used to confirm its position. Ideally, the tip  删除换行 of an ET tube should be located within the trachea, approximately 1–2 vertebral body  删除换行 heights above the carina. This allows ventilation of both lungs and incorrect placement  删除换行 should be highlighted urgently to the referring clinician. The commonest abnormality is  删除换行 advancement of the ET tube into the right main bronchus preferentially ventilating the  删除换行 right lung only. If not corrected, the patient may be compromised by left lung collapse. \n\n【11】An example of an ET tube in the right main bronchus is given in Figure 8.3.\n删除3：<u>Figure 8.2 Chest radiograph with labels.</u>\n\n【12】Endotracheal tube\n\n【13】Right internal jugular 删除换行 central venous catheter\n\n【14】Nasogastric tube on  删除换行 patients skin\n\n【15】Cardiac monitoring  删除换行 wire\n\n【16】Nasogastric tube as 删除换行 it passed GOJ21\n\n【17】• Nasogastric (NG) tubes: These are placed in patients for numerous reasons, most com删除8：<u>￾</u>monly nutritional. Correlating the position of an NG tube does not necessarily require  删除换行 a chest radiograph. Testing the pH of the aspirate can confirm placement within the  删除换行 stomach, thereby avoiding unnecessary radiation exposure. If this is not possible, a  删除换行 chest radiograph should demonstrate the NG tube as a midline linear opacity extend删除8：<u>￾</u>ing below the left hemidiaphragm. This confirms its presence in the stomach and not  删除换行 in a main stem bronchus, avoiding the catastrophic infusion of nutritional support  删除换行 into the lungs. The tip of an NG tube is not always seen on the chest radiograph, but  删除换行 should lie within the stomach. It can sometimes migrate into the duodenum with gas删除8：<u>￾</u>tric peristalsis and should be partially withdrawn.\n\n【18】• Central lines: Primarily placed in patients for the infusion of intravenous medication,  删除换行 central lines can also avoid the need for peripheral cannulation and risks of thrombo删除8：<u>￾</u>phlebitis. A chest radiograph is performed post insertion to confirm tip position and  删除换行 exclude the most serious complication of pneumothorax. A central line is a radio删除8：<u>￾</u>opaque density projected paramedially over the internal jugular or subclavian vessels,  删除换行 and can have a wide variety of appearances depending on the side it is inserted and  删除换行 how many lumens the line contains . It may also be tunnelled under the  删除换行 skin in the case of a Hickman line, with the possible addition of a buried metallic  删除换行 port (portacath). Recognizing the type of line is important but not essential. Correct  删除换行 tip positioning is critical for optimal infusion. The tip of a central line should ideally  删除换行 lie at the confluence of the inferior and superior vena cava as blood drains into the  删除换行 right atrium. This is identified on a chest radiograph at a point approximately one  删除换行 vertebral body height below the carina. A short line position carries thrombotic risks,  删除换行 while overenthusiastic advancement into the right atrium can encourage myocardial  删除换行 excitation and atrial ectopics.\n\n【19】• Others: ET tubes are not suitable for patients requiring long-term ventilatory support  删除换行 and often a tracheotomy is inserted just inferior to the cricoid cartilage.

Her caretaker reports that the child has been unable to bear weight on her left leg and that she fell down the stairs this morning. She was brought to the emergency department two other times in the past year, each time with trauma after falling down at home. Her examination is mostly unremarkable, but there are several bruises at varying stages of healing. X-ray of the leg shows a spiral fracture of her left femur.

The suspicion of child abuse arises when the injury and the story of the injury do not match. Spiral fractures generally do not occur with a simple fall down the stairs. Another indication of abuse is multiple bruises at varying stages of healing and this patient’s history of trauma occurring in the home. Suspicion of child abuse must be reported in all 50 states.  \n\n【7】Answer A is incorrect . Children with osteogenesis imperfecta can present with spiral fractures as a result of seemingly benign accidents. In this case, however, the history and evidence strongly support child abuse.  \n\n【8】Answer B is incorrect . Retinal hemorrhage and detachment also are seen frequently in cases of child abuse. If there is suspicion of retinal damage, the child should then see an ophthalmologist, but an urgent retinal examination is not necessary at this time.  \n\n【9】Answer D is incorrect . Although confronting the family and offering assistance may be well intended, it is not the appropriate course of action in this situation.  \n\n【10】Answer E is incorrect .

Rupture of the fibrous cap reveals the highly thrombogenic extracellular lipid core， initiating platelet activation and aggregation as well as thrombin activation . Less frequently， an erosion\n删除3：<u>Figure 1-2. Pathophysiology of STEMI. a cute coronary syndromes typically begin with the rupture of a vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque (a). Interaction between the bloodstream and plaque contents(particularly oxidized 1 Dl cholesterol) results in platelet activation and aggregation (b). Fibrinogen is cleaved by thrombin to fibrin， which then complexes with activated platelets to form a thrombus(c) that may ultimately propagate and occlude the vessel lumen， causing infarction (d).

Other rare causes of STEMI include coronary artery spasm， coronary artery dissection， arteritis， cocaine abuse， and embolism to a coronary artery. All of these pathologic mechanisms have a common final pathway to inducing myocar-dial ischemia and ultimately infarction if artery patency is not established within approximately 30 minutes ofocclusion. In other words， the lack of blood flow results in myocyte ATP depletion and subsequent coagulation necrosis ofthe myocardium.also seen. The character can be similar to stable angina； however， the pain associ-ated with STEMI is of longer duration (typically> 20-30 minutes)， not relieved by nitroglycerin， and more intense. Associated symptoms include dyspnea， diaphoresis， palpitations， nausea， vomiting， extreme fatigue， or an impending sense of doom. Importantly， patients with diabetes， women， or the elderly may present without chest pain， only describing a nonspecific discomfort in combination with one of the aforementioned associated symptoms such as dyspnea or diaphoresis. One must maintain a high index of suspicion in these patient populations.The most important action to take in any patient presenting with possible STEMI is to obtain an ECG. This should be performed and interpreted immediately on presentation so that emergent reperfusion therapy can be initiated if indicated. ECG criteria diagnostic ofSTEMI include ST elevation of1 mm or greater in two or more contiguous leads. In leads V2-V3， at least 1.5 mm of ST elevation in women and 2 mm or greater in men are needed to make the diagnosis. The infarct-related artery can be identified according to which leads are involved . In addi-tion， any patient with symptoms suggesting ACS in the setting of a new left bundle branch block (LBBB) should be treated as diagnostic for STEMI. In patients with old LBBB， the criteria in Table 1-2 can be helpful in diagnosing STEMI. Ifthe diag-nosis remains unclear in patients with LBBB， emergent echocardiography is indi-cated to explore for regional wall motion abnormalities that may suggest underlying active myocardial injury. Wall motion assessment by echocardiography is also help-ful in cases where ECG findings are not characteristic for STEMI although there is a high index of suspicion based on clinical presentation such as ongoing typical chest pain unrelieved with nitroglycerin administration. Complete occlusion of the left circumflex artery (LCx)， for example， will occasionally present with minimal to no ECG changes. Echocardiography can reveal akinesis ofthe lateral wall， suggestive of STEMI and the need for emergent reperfusion therapy.</u>\n\n| Table 1-1·ECG CHANGES AND CORRELATION WITH INFARCT-RELATED ARIERY  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Category  | Infarct-Related CoronaryArtery  | ECG Characteristics  |\n| anterior  | left anterior descending (1aD)  | ST elevation in V1-V4  |\n| Iateral  | l eft circumflex (1Cx)  | ST elevation in V5-V6，I， aⅥ  |\n| Inferior  | Right coronary artery (RCa) (80%) orl Cx(20%)  | ST elevation in I， Ⅲ， aVF  |\n| Posterior  | RCa or1Cx  | Tall R wave in V1-V3 ， with STdepression in V1-V3  |\n\n| Table 1-2·ECG CRITERIA FOR DIAGNOSING STEMI IN PATIENTS WITH  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| UNDERLYINGLEFT BUNCLE BRANCH BLOCK(LBBB)  |  |\n| Criterion  | Score  |\n| ST segment elevation ≥1 mm concordant with QRS  | 5  |\n| ST segment depression≥1mm in leads V1， V2， or V3  | 3  |\n| ST segment elevation 25 mm discordant with QRS  | 2  |\n\n【12】Note：≥3 points =90% specifcity and a 88% positive predictive value.\n\n【13】Laboratory investigation is also important for the diagnosis of STEMI； how-ever， there may be a significant delay between the time of vessel occlusion and the return ofthe first positive biomarker assay. Thus， one should not wait for laboratory data before making a decision regarding reperfusion therapy in patients with symp-toms and ECG findings diagnostic for STEMI. Contemporary cardiac biomarkers include creatine kinase (CK)， creatine kinase myocardial band (CK-MB)， troponin I (TnI)， and troponin T (TnT). CK is present throughout skeletal tissue， whereas CK-MB is more specific to cardiac muscle. Both are released during STEMI and are measureable within 4-6 hours， peak within the first 24 hours， and normalize by 48-72 hours. TnI and TnT are both specific and sensitive for acute myocardial infarction. They are released within 4-8 hours after symptom onset and generally peak by 12-36 hours. Troponins can remain elevated for up to a week after an acute event.Another important diagnosis on the differential for sudden-onset chest pain is pulmonary embolism. This typically presents with acute onset of dyspnea and pleu-ritic chest pain. ECG will most often show sinus tachycardia， although it may reveal acute cor pulmonale with a S1Q3T3 pattern (prominent S wave in lead I along with a Q wave and inverted T wave in lead III). Echocardiography may reveal evidence of right ventricular strain and is helpful in ruling out regional wall motion abnormali-ties of the left ventricle.After diagnosis of STEMI based on the above， all patients should be administered aspirin 325 mg unless a true aspirin allergy exists. Each patient should also receive an oral loading dose of an ADP inhibitor such as clopidogrel 600 mg， prasugrel 60 mg， or ticagrelor 180 mg. If the patient is selected for fibrinolytic therapy then admin-istration of clopidogrel 300 mg is recommended. All patients should also receive a parenteral anticoagulant. Traditionally， unfractionated heparin has been used. For those undergoing fibrinolytic therapy， enoxaparin has been shown to be superior to unfractionated heparin. Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors should not be administered at first presentation in patients who have received dual antiplatelet therapy but generally are reserved for use by an interventional cardiologist ifthe patient is expe-riencing thrombotic complications.\n\n【14】While the aforementioned therapies are important in the treatment of STEMI， the most important clinical decision in STEMI management pertains to the patient’s candidacy for reperfusion therapy. Time is ofthe essence to prevent irreversible myo-cardial damage as there is an inverse relationship between time to reperfusion and survival benefit. There are no absolute contraindications to PCI， and it is the rec-ommended method of reperfusion when it can be performed in a timely manner. Specifically， the goal is to limit the “door to balloon”time at a PCI-capable facility to under 90 minutes； that is， angioplasty should be performed less than 90 minutes from the time the patient first presents for treatment. Ifthe patient arrives to a non-PCI capable facility， an extra 30 minutes is permitted (for a total of 120 minutes) to allow time for transfer.\n\n【15】If facilities for PCI are not available in a timely manner， then reperfusion with a fibrinolytic， unless contraindicated， should be employed within 30 minutes of\n\n| Table 1-3·ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE CONTRAINDICATIONS TOFIBRINOLYTIC THERAPY  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Absolute Contraindications  | Relative Contraindications  |\n| any prior ICH Known structural brain lesion Known intrancranial neoplasm Ischemic stroke within 3 months Suspected aortic dissection a ctive bleeding (not menses) Closed head trauma within 3 months  | History of chronic， severe hypertension SBP> 180 or DBP>110mmHg Traumatic or prolonged CPR (> 10 min) Ischemic stroke >3 months agoRecent internal bleeding (within 4 weeks) Noncompressible vascular punctures Pregnancy a ctive peptic ulcer a ctive anticoagulation  |hospital arrival. Absolute contraindications to fibrinolysis include suspected aortic dissection， active bleeding or diathesis (not including menses)， history of hemor-rhagic stroke， intracranial neoplasm or cerebral vascular lesion， or a history of isch-emic stroke， closed head， or facial trauma within the last 3 months . After administration of a fibrinolytic agent， all patients， especially those who are at high risk (extensive ST segment elevation， history of myocardial infarction， recent-onset LBBB， tachycardia， or hypotension)， should be transferred to a PCI-capable facility as soon as possible so that PCI can be performed as needed. After these ini-tial therapies， the patient should be monitored in a coronary intensive care unit so that any potential complications can be quickly identified and treated.\n\n【17】Acute complications of STEMI include arrhythmias， pump failure， papillary muscle rupture or dysfunction， ventricular septal rupture， ventricular free wall rupture， or embolic complications. Late complications include postin farct pericarditis (Dressler syndrome) and ventricular aneurysm formation. Within the first 24 48 hours of STEMI， patients are at increased risk ofventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF)， particularly for those who are not revascularized in a timely man-ner or are incompletely revascularized. Patients with sustained VT or VF should be treated immediately with electrical defibrillation or cardioversion as well as intravenous amiodarone. Although premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) are frequently seen in these patients， prior studies have shown increased mortality when antiarrhythmics are used for PVC suppression； therefore， these agents should be avoided. Any electrolyte derangement such as hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia should be treated. One should not confuse VT with an accelerated idioventricular rhythm， which is a wide complex rhythm at a heart rate of 60-120 bpm that fre-quently accompanies myocardial reperfusion . Accelerated idioventricu-lar rhythm is benign and almost always asymptomatic. Supraventricular tachycardias(SVTs) are less common， although they should be treated to prevent increased myo-cardial oxygen demand. If the SVT causes hemodynamic compromise， immediate\n删除3：<u>Figure 1-3. accelerated idioventricular rhythm. Commonly referred to as reperfusion arhythmia， this transient wide complex rhythm is typically asymptomatic and does not cause hemodynamic instabilityPatients with inferior STEMI may experience right ventricular (RV) infarction and failure. These patients will typically present with hypotension and elevated jugular venous pressures， but with no pulmonary congestion.

Interaction between the bloodstream and plaque contents(particularly oxidized 1 Dl cholesterol) results in platelet activation and aggregation (b). Fibrinogen is cleaved by thrombin to fibrin， which then complexes with activated platelets to form a thrombus(c) that may ultimately propagate and occlude the vessel lumen， causing infarction (d).

Thus， one should not wait for laboratory data before making a decision regarding reperfusion therapy in patients with symp-toms and ECG findings diagnostic for STEMI. Contemporary cardiac biomarkers include creatine kinase (CK)， creatine kinase myocardial band (CK-MB)， troponin I (TnI)， and troponin T (TnT). CK is present throughout skeletal tissue， whereas CK-MB is more specific to cardiac muscle. Both are released during STEMI and are measureable within 4-6 hours， peak within the first 24 hours， and normalize by 48-72 hours. TnI and TnT are both specific and sensitive for acute myocardial infarction. They are released within 4-8 hours after symptom onset and generally peak by 12-36 hours. Troponins can remain elevated for up to a week after an acute event.Another important diagnosis on the differential for sudden-onset chest pain is pulmonary embolism. This typically presents with acute onset of dyspnea and pleu-ritic chest pain. ECG will most often show sinus tachycardia， although it may reveal acute cor pulmonale with a S1Q3T3 pattern (prominent S wave in lead I along with a Q wave and inverted T wave in lead III). Echocardiography may reveal evidence of right ventricular strain and is helpful in ruling out regional wall motion abnormali-ties of the left ventricle.After diagnosis of STEMI based on the above， all patients should be administered aspirin 325 mg unless a true aspirin allergy exists. Each patient should also receive an oral loading dose of an ADP inhibitor such as clopidogrel 600 mg， prasugrel 60 mg， or ticagrelor 180 mg. If the patient is selected for fibrinolytic therapy then admin-istration of clopidogrel 300 mg is recommended. All patients should also receive a parenteral anticoagulant. Traditionally， unfractionated heparin has been used. For those undergoing fibrinolytic therapy， enoxaparin has been shown to be superior to unfractionated heparin. Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors should not be administered at first presentation in patients who have received dual antiplatelet therapy but generally are reserved for use by an interventional cardiologist ifthe patient is expe-riencing thrombotic complications.\n\n【14】While the aforementioned therapies are important in the treatment of STEMI， the most important clinical decision in STEMI management pertains to the patient’s candidacy for reperfusion therapy. Time is ofthe essence to prevent irreversible myo-cardial damage as there is an inverse relationship between time to reperfusion and survival benefit. There are no absolute contraindications to PCI， and it is the rec-ommended method of reperfusion when it can be performed in a timely manner. Specifically， the goal is to limit the “door to balloon”time at a PCI-capable facility to under 90 minutes； that is， angioplasty should be performed less than 90 minutes from the time the patient first presents for treatment. Ifthe patient arrives to a non-PCI capable facility， an extra 30 minutes is permitted (for a total of 120 minutes) to allow time for transfer.\n\n【15】If facilities for PCI are not available in a timely manner， then reperfusion with a fibrinolytic， unless contraindicated， should be employed within 30 minutes of\n\n| Table 1-3·ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE CONTRAINDICATIONS TOFIBRINOLYTIC THERAPY  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Absolute Contraindications  | Relative Contraindications  |\n| any prior ICH Known structural brain lesion Known intrancranial neoplasm Ischemic stroke within 3 months Suspected aortic dissection a ctive bleeding (not menses) Closed head trauma within 3 months  | History of chronic， severe hypertension SBP> 180 or DBP>110mmHg Traumatic or prolonged CPR (> 10 min) Ischemic stroke >3 months agoRecent internal bleeding (within 4 weeks) Noncompressible vascular punctures Pregnancy a ctive peptic ulcer a ctive anticoagulation  |hospital arrival. Absolute contraindications to fibrinolysis include suspected aortic dissection， active bleeding or diathesis (not including menses)， history of hemor-rhagic stroke， intracranial neoplasm or cerebral vascular lesion， or a history of isch-emic stroke， closed head， or facial trauma within the last 3 months . After administration of a fibrinolytic agent， all patients， especially those who are at high risk (extensive ST segment elevation， history of myocardial infarction， recent-onset LBBB， tachycardia， or hypotension)， should be transferred to a PCI-capable facility as soon as possible so that PCI can be performed as needed. After these ini-tial therapies， the patient should be monitored in a coronary intensive care unit so that any potential complications can be quickly identified and treated.\n\n【17】Acute complications of STEMI include arrhythmias， pump failure， papillary muscle rupture or dysfunction， ventricular septal rupture， ventricular free wall rupture， or embolic complications. Late complications include postin farct pericarditis (Dressler syndrome) and ventricular aneurysm formation. Within the first 24 48 hours of STEMI， patients are at increased risk ofventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF)， particularly for those who are not revascularized in a timely man-ner or are incompletely revascularized. Patients with sustained VT or VF should be treated immediately with electrical defibrillation or cardioversion as well as intravenous amiodarone. Although premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) are frequently seen in these patients， prior studies have shown increased mortality when antiarrhythmics are used for PVC suppression； therefore， these agents should be avoided. Any electrolyte derangement such as hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia should be treated. One should not confuse VT with an accelerated idioventricular rhythm， which is a wide complex rhythm at a heart rate of 60-120 bpm that fre-quently accompanies myocardial reperfusion . Accelerated idioventricu-lar rhythm is benign and almost always asymptomatic. Supraventricular tachycardias(SVTs) are less common， although they should be treated to prevent increased myo-cardial oxygen demand. If the SVT causes hemodynamic compromise， immediate\n删除3：<u>Figure 1-3. accelerated idioventricular rhythm.

A diag删除8：<u>￾</u>nosis of miscarriage can be made on the basis of a detailed history and examination or on  删除换行 ultrasound. Some women can have bleeding with a viable pregnancy. A miscarriage is a spon删除8：<u>￾</u>taneous loss of a pregnancy before viability at 24 weeks’ gestation and is classified by clinical  删除换行 type . It is common and occurs in 20% of clinical pregnancies with the major删除8：<u>￾</u>ity of these occurring within the first trimester. Recurrent miscarriage affects 1% of women  删除换行 trying to conceive and is defined as the loss of three or more consecutive pregnancies. Risk  删除换行 factors for miscarriage include advanced maternal age, smoking, obesity, previous history of  删除换行 miscarriage and treatment to the cervix. Antiphospholipid syndrome is the most important  删除换行 treatable cause for recurrent miscarriage.\n\n【13】Women often present with a history of vaginal bleeding and cramp-like lower abdominal  删除换行 pain. They may only have very light bleeding, or they may report heavy bleeding, filling mul删除8：<u>￾</u>tiple pads and passing large clots. It is important to perform a speculum examination on  删除换行 these patients to assess whether the cervical os is open or closed and to look for other causes  删除换行 of vaginal bleeding. Some women may present with signs of shock or collapse following vag删除8：<u>￾</u>inal bleeding secondary to cervical shock. It is essential to examine these women with a  删除换行 speculum and remove any products of conception that may be stuck within the cervical canal  删除换行 causing reflex bradycardia and a vasovagal effect.\n\n【14】It is important to keep in mind all causes of vaginal bleeding and pelvic pain including cervi删除8：<u>￾</u>cal ectropion, cervical polyp, ectopic pregnancy, molar pregnancy, cervical carcinoma, uri删除8：<u>￾</u>nary tract infection, appendicitis and a ruptured ovarian cyst.\n\n【15】Baseline investigations required within the Emergency Department include a urinary preg删除8：<u>￾</u>nancy test, a full blood count and group and screen to assess for anaemia and the patient’s  删除换行 rhesus status.

Ultimately  删除换行 the patient will require a transvaginal ultrasound scan, which should be arranged with the  删除换行 gynaecology department as there are strict ultrasound criteria for diagnosing a miscarriage.\n\n【16】Table 90.1 Classification of miscarriage\n\n【17】Missed miscarriage Ultrasound features of a non-viable or non-continuing pregnancy,  删除换行 despite the absence of clinical features. \n\n【18】Threatened miscarriage Threat of miscarriage with unprovoked vaginal bleeding with or  删除换行 without abdominal pain.

Options (depending on urgency and gestational size)  删除换行 include\n\n【25】1. Expectant management, using a watch and wait approach. This avoids medical  删除换行 intervention and can be managed at home. However, it is unpredictable and has  删除换行 a higher chance of retained products. It is usually more successful for incomplete  删除换行 miscarriages.\n\n【26】2. Medical management, using vaginal (or oral) misoprostol. This avoids surgical risks  删除换行 and can also be managed at home. However, it still holds risks of infection and heavy  删除换行 bleeding, and if it fails, patients may still require surgical intervention.\n\n【27】3. Surgical management to evacuate retained products of conception (ERPC). This is  删除换行 the least likely to fail and can be arranged in advance. Modern management now  删除换行 allows this to be performed under general anaesthetic or under local anaesthetic  删除换行 using manual vacuum aspiration (MVA). Nevertheless, these still hold the risks of  删除换行 surgical complications.\n\n【28】Women who are bleeding heavily or who are at increased risk of haemorrhage will require  删除换行 immediate surgical management to arrest the bleeding. Offer anti-D immunoglobulin to  删除换行 all women who are Rhesus negative and have surgical management of miscarriage and to  删除换行 women who are beyond 12 + 0 weeks of gestation. This precludes haemolytic disease of the  删除换行 fetus and newborn in future pregnancies.\n\n【29】Depending on trust policy, in-hours stable patients can usually be sent straight to the Early \n\n【30】Pregnancy Assessment Unit (EPAU) for a scan. Out of hours you should liaise with the on删除8：<u>￾</u>call gynaecology doctor. If the patient only has moderate bleeding and is otherwise well, she  删除换行 can normally be brought back the following day for a scan in the department.\n\n【31】She will be very distressed and it is important to keep her calm and not to diagnose a miscar删除8：<u>￾</u>riage without confirmation by ultrasound unless fetal points are seen. Once a diagnosis has  删除换行 been made, it is vital to express sympathy and provide adequate counselling. She must be  删除换行 reassured that miscarriages are common, that they are usually due to sporadic chromosomal  删除换行 abnormalities and that it is not a result of anything that she has done. It is important for her  删除换行 to know that although she has had two consecutive miscarriages, there is a very good chance  删除换行 that she will have a normal pregnancy in the future. Contact information and information  删除换行 leaflets can be given for support and counselling groups. All women who have recurrent  删除换行 miscarriages should be referred to the Recurrent Miscarriage Clinic for further investigation.\n\n【32】Advise that a repeat scan may be required after treatment if bleeding persists, if there are signs  删除换行 of infection or if bleeding does not start up to 2 weeks after expectant management.\n\n【33】Key Points\n\n【34】• Bleeding in early pregnancy is common and does not necessarily lead to miscarriage.\n\n【35】• Assess all women with bleeding in early pregnancy along standard ED guidelines  删除换行 and resuscitate those that display signs of shock or large bleeds.\n\n【36】• Perform baseline blood investigations if bleeding is heavy.\n\n【37】• Stable patients with low-volume blood loss may be brought back to EPAU the  删除换行 next day.\n\n【38】• Patients with heavy bleeding or signs of shock should be managed in the resusci删除8：<u>￾</u>tation room and referred to the gynaecology team.\n\n【39】• Women and their partners will be emotionally distressed and should be treated  删除换行 with empathy and kindness.删除9：<u>http://taylorandfrancis.com313</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 14:02:10", "endTime": "2024/09/12 14:03:20", "cost": 70.106}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:28", "update_time": "2024-09-11 22:03:19", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 22:02:08"}

Her vitals are BP 160/90， HR 120， RR 18， T 100.5°F， pulse ox 100%.On examination she is picking at the air， has decreased bowel sounds， 6-mm pupils and no moisture in her axilla. Her blood sugar is normal. Which medication should they give her?\n\n【13】A. Atropine\n\n【14】B.Pralidoxime\n\n【15】C.IPhysostigmine\n\n【16】D. Flumazenil\n\n【17】E.Fomepizole\n\n【18】56.4 A 55-year-old homeless woman presents to the ED brought by ambulance. The police found her seizing in the street. Her vital signs are BP 220/150， HR 140， T 101°F， RR 16， pulse ox 100% on room air. On examination she has 6 mm pupils， very wet skin， decreased bowel sounds and is having uncontrollable limb movements. A check of her blood sugar is normal. What medication should this patient be administered?\n\n【19】A.IPhysostigmine\n\n【20】Lorazepam\n\n【21】Labetalol\n\n【22】D. Atropine then pralidoxime\n\n【23】Phytonadione\n\n【24】ANSWERS\n\n【25】56.1 D. This patient is exhibiting a cholinergic toxidrome. The mnemonic for this is DUMBBELLS (Defecation， Urination， Miosis， Bradycardia， Bronchor-rhea， Emesis， Lacrimation， Lethargy， and Salivation). The treatment is to prevent the patient from drowning in his or her own saliva by administering atropine 1 mg at a time until the secretions dry up. In addition， pralidoxime(2-PAM) is administered to increase acetylcholinesterase availability and reduce acetylcholine. Benzodiazepines would not help with this patient. Phy-sostigmine is a treatment for anti-muscarinic toxicity and would worsen this patient condition. Pyridoxine is vitamin B6 and can be useful in treating sei-zures if they are caused by isoniazid (INH). Naloxone is an opiate antagonist and while this presentation has some overlap with the opiate toxidrome， this patient is tachypneic and has excessive secretions that are not seen in the opiate toxidrome. His exposure was from the pesticides on the farm.\n\n【26】56.2 B. This patient is exhibiting an opiate toxidrome. He has miotic pupils and decreased respirations， GI motility and mental status. The treatment for this is patient should include a trial of naloxone； enough to increase his oxygenation. This patient likely stole opiate medication from his grandmother. Charcoal would not help this patient as he is already severely symptomatic. Additionally， charcoal would be contraindicated in this patient because of the risk of aspiration. Flumazenil is a benzodiazepine antagonist. Lorazepam is a benzodiazepine. Atropine is a strong anti-muscarinic drug and would not be helpful in treating this patient.\n\n【27】56.3 C. This patient is exhibiting an antimuscarinic toxidrome. This is charac-terized by tachycardia， fever， hallucinosis， dilated pupils， hypoactive bowel sounds， and dry axilla. The mnemonic is： mad as a hatter (hallucinations)， dry as a bone (anhydrosis)， red as a beet (increased agitation and fever)， and blind as a bat (mydriasis). Treatment should be either decreasing the agita-tion and temperature through benzodiazepines or increasing acetylcholine by preventing its metabolism (physostigmine， an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor). Atropine is an anti-muscarinic drug and would worsen this patient toxidrome. Pralidoxime is a drug which makes acetylcholinesterase work again after expo-sure to an organophosphate. This patient does not have signs of cholinergic excess， therefore， pralidoxime would not be helpful. Flumazenil should not be given to adult patients because， as acting benzodiazepine antagonist， it may precipitate seizures that are not responsive to benzodiazepines. Fomepizole is an inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase and is helpful in the treatment of patients poisoned with ethylene glycol， methanol or other toxic alcohols. This patient had an accidental overdose of her diphenhydramine for her seasonal allergies.\n\n【28】56.4 B. This patient is exhibiting a sympathomimetic toxidrome. Her presenta-tion is very similar to the patient in question 3. However， the key difference is that this patient has wet skin， while the patient in question 3 has dry skin. The patient should receive as much lorazepam as is needed to stop the seizure and allow the temperature to fall. Physostigmine is a treatment for anti-muscarinic toxicity and would not be helpful in this patient. Labetalol is aβ-blocker. This patient has signs of active sympathomimetic excess. Treatment with a B-blocker may lead to unopposed o-1 agonism and potentially may worsen a patient tissue perfusion. While this patient is wet， she has none of the other signs of a cholinergic toxicity. Therefore， atropine and pralidoxime are not recommended. Phytonadione is vitamin K and is the treatment for warfarin toxicity. This patient recently used crack cocaine.\n\n【29】CLINICALPEARLS\n\n【30】Patients who are hypoxic from an overdose typically will require a defini-tive airway such as endotracheal or nasotracheal intubation.\n\n【31】Fever from an overdose is a poor prognostic indicator and should usually be addressed with large doses of benzodiazepines and intravenous fluids.\n\n【32】Symptomatic patients require observation or admission until they are asymptomatic.\n\n【33】In the undifferentiated altered mental status patient， blood sugar level should immediately be checked.\n\n【34】The nearest poison control center should be contacted 通用删除7(英):<u>(1-800-222-1222)</u> for overdoses， accidental ingestions， and adverse drug effects.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 13:37:31", "endTime": "2024/09/12 13:39:07", "cost": 95.88}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:28", "update_time": "2024-09-11 21:39:06", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 21:37:29"}

The cardiothoracic ratio is the maximum transverse  删除换行 diameter of the heart divided by the greatest internal diameter of the thoracic cage (from  删除换行 inside of rib to inside of rib).

Therefore, the cardiothoracic ratio is a convenient  删除换行 way of separating most normal hearts from most abnormal hearts. The heart size should  删除换行 be assessed on every chest radiograph. On an AP film the cardiac size is magnified so  删除换行 a ratio over 50 per cent may not indicate cardiac enlargement. If the heart is enlarged,  删除换行 check for other signs of heart failure such as pulmonary oedema, septal (Kerley B) lines  删除换行 and pleural effusions.\n\n【13】A multitude of conditions can give rise to cardiomegaly, which is thought to result  删除换行 from the direct effect of the thickening of the heart muscles when the heart is given an  删除换行 increased workload.

This diagnosis would be supported by laboratory studies demonstrating adecreased iron concentration， increased total iron binding capacity， and decreased ferritin levels.The cause for a patient's iron deficiency， however， needs to be further pursued. In addition， comorbidinflammatory conditions can raise serum ferritin， resulting in values within the normal range.  |\n| What factors can lead to this condition? Causes of iron deficiency anemia include the following： ·Chronic blood loss (especially gastrointestinal blood loss secondary to colon cancer).DDietary deficiency (increased demand or decreased absorption). Intestinal hookworm infection (this is the most common cause worldwide and should be considered inpatients who have immigrated from developing countries). In general， in a postmenopausal woman and all men， one must look for Gl blood loss in any newlydiagnosed patient with iron deficiency anemia unless the cause of the iron loss is obvious (nose bleeds，recent trauma， etc).  |\n| Why are total iron binding capacity (TIBC) measurements important in this condition?TIBC is high in iron deficiency anemia and low in anemia of chronic disease. Both illnesses have decreasedserum iron levels. A low ferritin (< 41 ng/mL) is sensitive and specific for iron deficiency anemia. The normaliron/TIBC ratio is typically 0.25-0.45， and levels <0.12 indicate iron deficiency. Anemia of chronic diseaseoften has a normal iron/TIBC ratio because of the concomitant decrease of TIBC and serum iron.  |\n| What other conditions is this patient at greatly increased risk for developing?Because of the extreme lack of iron， this patient is at risk for Plummer-Vinson syndrome. This syndrome ischaracterized by atrophic glossitis， esophageal webs， and anemia.  |\n| What are the common causes of microcytic， hypochromic anemia?Microcytic anemia results from either decreased hemoglobin production or faulty hemoglobin function.Common causes include iron deficiency， thalassemia， sideroblastic anemia， and lead poisoning.  |", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 14:24:41", "endTime": "2024/09/12 14:25:29", "cost": 48.06}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:28", "update_time": "2024-09-11 22:25:29", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 22:24:40"}

Because the process is caused by acute thrombosis, antiplatelet agents such as aspirin and anticoagulation with heparin are used. To limit infarct size, beta-blockers are used to decrease myocardial oxygen demand, and nitrates are given to increase coronary blood flow. All of these therapies appear to reduce mortality in patients with acute MI. In addition, morphine may be given to reduce pain and the consequent tachycardia, and patients are placed on supplemental oxygen .\n删除3：<u>Figure 1–3. Algorithm for assessment and treatment of chest pain.</u>\n\n【6】Because prompt restoration of myocardial perfusion reduces mortality in STEMI, a decision should be made as to whether the patient can either receive thrombolytics or undergo primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Where it is readily available, primary PCI is the preferred therapy for most patients, as it is more effective than fibrinolysis in opening occluded arteries, and is associated with better clinical outcomes.\n\n【7】Individuals with ST-segment elevation MI benefit from thrombolytics, with a lower mortality, greater preservation of myocardial function, and fewer complications ; patients without ST-segment elevation do not receive the same mortality benefit. Because myocardium can be salvaged only before it is irreversibly injured (“time is muscle”), patients benefit maximally when the drug is given early, for example, within 1 to 3 hours after the onset of chest pain , and the relative benefits decline with time. Because systemic coagulopathy may develop, the major risk of thrombolytics is bleeding , which can be potentially disastrous, for example, intracranial hemorrhage. The risk of hemorrhage is relatively constant, so the risk begins to outweigh the benefit by 12 hours, at which time most infarctions are completed, that is, the at-risk myocardium is dead.\n\n【8】Thrombolytic therapy is indicated if all of the following criteria are met:\n\n【9】1\\. Clinical complaints are consistent with ischemic-type chest pain.\n\n【10】2\\. ST-segment elevation more than 1 mm in at least two anatomically contiguous leads.\n\n【11】3\\. There are no contraindications to thrombolytic therapy.\n\n【12】4\\. Patient is younger than 75 years (greater risk of hemorrhage if >75).\n\n【13】Patients with STEMI should not receive thrombolytics if they have a clear contraindication, such as recent major surgery, active internal bleeding or suspected aortic dissection, severe hypertension, or a prior history of a hemorrhagic stroke.\n\n【14】Percutaneous coronary intervention is effective in restoring perfusion in patients with acute STEMI and has been shown in multiple trials to provide a greater survival benefit than thrombolysis and to have a lower risk for serious bleeding when performed by experienced operators in dedicated medical centers. If patients with an acute STEMI present within 2 to 3 hours of symptom onset and receive PCI ideally within 90 minutes, then PCI is the recommended reperfusion therapy. PCI also can be used in patients with a contraindication to thrombolytic therapy or who are hypotensive or in cardiogenic shock, for whom thrombolytics offer no survival benefit. PCI is accomplished by cardiac catheterization, in which a guidewire is inserted into the occluded coronary artery and a small balloon threaded over the guidewire and inflated in an attempt to open the blockage and restore blood flow. Sometimes intraluminal expandable stents are deployed, which may improve vessel patency. Use of primary PCI may be limited by the availability of the facilities and personnel required to perform the procedure in a timely fashion.\n\n【15】#### COMPLICATIONS OF ACUTE MI\n\n【16】Mortality in acute MI usually is a result of ventricular arrhythmias, or myocardial pump failure and resultant cardiogenic shock.\n\n【17】Life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias , such as ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) , are common, especially in the first 24 hours. Historically, the majority of deaths from acute MI occurred in the first hour and were caused by VT/VF. This has diminished in recent years with earlier and more aggressive treatment of ischemia and arrhythmias. Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are very common but generally they are not treated with antiarrhythmic agents unless they occur very frequently, are sustained, or induce hemodynamic compromise. Sustained VT (>30 seconds) and VF are life threatening because they prevent coordinated ventricular contraction and thus often cause pulselessness and cardiovascular collapse. They are treated with direct current (DC) cardioversion or defibrillation , followed by infusion of intravenous antiarrhythmics such as amiodarone . Electrolyte deficiency, such as hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, which can potentiate ventricular arrhythmias, should be corrected. One benign ventricular arrhythmia that is generally not suppressed by antiarrhythmics is the accelerated idioventricular rhythm . This is a wide-complex escape rhythm between 60 and 110 bpm that frequently accompanies reperfusion of the myocardium but causes no hemodynamic compromise.\n\n【18】Supraventricular or atrial tachyarrhythmias are much less common after acute MI, but they can worsen ischemia and cause infarct extension as a consequence of the rate-related increase in myocardial oxygen demand. When they cause hemodynamic instability, they also are treated with immediate DC cardioversion. Other frequent rhythm disturbances are bradyarrhythmias. Sinus bradycardia is frequently seen in inferior MI because the right coronary artery supplies the sinoatrial node, but the condition generally requires no treatment unless it causes hypotension. If the rate is slow enough to cause cardiac output and blood pressure to fall, intravenous atropine usually is administered.\n\n【19】Bradyarrhythmias can be caused by atrioventricular (AV) conduction disturbances. First-degree AV block (P-R interval prolongation) and Mobitz I seconddegree AV block (gradual prolongation of the P-R interval before a nonconducted P wave) often are caused by AV nodal dysfunction, for example, nodal ischemia caused by inferior MI. Patients who are symptomatic can be treated with atropine .\n\n【20】AV conduction disturbances can be caused by dysfunction below the AV node, within the bundles of His, and typically produce a widened QRS complex. Examples include Mobitz II second-degree AV block (nonconducted P waves not preceded by PR prolongation) and third-degree AV block (complete AV dissociation with no P-wave conduction). Third-degree AV block also can be caused by AV nodal dysfunction. These arrhythmias are described more fully in Case 15 . Conduction disturbances caused by involvement of the bundles of His include LBBB or rightbundle branch block (RBBB) with left anterior hemiblock . All of these conduction disturbances have a worse prognosis than does AV nodal dysfunction because they are generally seen with anterior infarction in which a significant amount of myocardium is damaged. When symptomatic bradycardias such as third-degree AV block develop, they are best treated with external pacing or placement of a temporary transvenous pacemaker .\n\n【21】#### CARDIAC PUMP FAILURE AND CARDIOGENIC SHOCK\n\n【22】Cardiogenic shock in acute MI usually is the most severe form of left ventricular (LV) pump failure. Ischemic reduction in ventricular diastolic compliance may lead to transient pulmonary congestion, associated with elevated left-sided filling pressures. Extensive myocardial necrosis and less contracting heart muscle may cause systolic failure and reduced cardiac output. Patients with hypotension frequently are evaluated by pulmonary artery (Swan-Ganz) catheterization to assess hemodynamic parameters. Cardiogenic shock is diagnosed when the patient has hypotension with systolic arterial pressure less than 80 mm Hg, markedly reduced cardiac index less than 1.8 L/min/m <sup>2 </sup> , and elevated LV filling pressure (measured indirectly with a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure >18 mm Hg). Clinically, such patients appear hypotensive, with cold extremities because of peripheral vasoconstriction, pulmonary edema, and elevated jugular venous pressure, reflecting high left- and right-sided filling pressures. Supportive treatment includes hemodynamic monitoring, adequate ventilation and oxygenation, and blood pressure support with vasopressors such as dobutamine and dopamine. These patients also may require mechanical assistance to augment blood pressure while providing afterload reduction, using intraaortic balloon counterpulsation. Cardiogenic shock may require urgent revascularization with primary PCI or coronary artery bypass surgery.\n\n【23】Hypotension may also be seen in patients with right ventricular (RV) infarction , which is a complication of right coronary artery occlusion and inferior infarction. In this case, LV function is not impaired, but LV filling is dramatically reduced because of the right-sided ventricular failure (the left heart can only pump out what it receives from the right heart). These patients can be recognized clinically as hypotensive, with markedly elevated jugular venous pressure but clear lung fields and no pulmonary edema seen radiographically (in contrast to the pulmonary edema seen in patients with hypotension to LV failure), and the diagnosis confirmed by observation of ST-segment elevation in a right-sided ECG. In this setting, RV function is impaired and highly dependent on adequate preload, so treatment requires support consisting of volume replacement with saline or colloid solution. Diuretics or nitrates that might lower the preload can be disastrous in these patients by causing hypotension and cardiovascular collapse, and thus should be avoided.\n\n【24】A number of mechanical problems can complicate acute MI, usually within the first week. The most common is papillary muscle dysfunction caused by LV ischemia or infarction, leading to mitral regurgitation that may be hemodynamically significant. This is in contrast with papillary muscle rupture , which produces a flail mitral leaflet and acute mitral regurgitation with development of heart failure and cardiogenic shock. Development of acute heart failure and shock in association with a new holosystolic murmur also may signify ventricular septal rupture. Doppler echocardiography can be used to distinguish among these conditions. In all of them, stabilization of cardiogenic shock is accomplished using afterload reduction with intravenous nitroglycerin or nitroprusside and sometimes with aortic balloon counterpulsation until definitive, urgent, surgical repair can be accomplished.\n\n【25】The most catastrophic mechanical complication is rupture of the ventricular free wall . As blood fills the pericardium, cardiac tamponade develops rapidly, with sudden pulselessness, hypotension, and loss of consciousness. This complication nearly always is fatal.\n\n【26】Late complications that occur several weeks after an acute MI include development of a ventricular aneurysm , which should be suspected if ST-segment elevation persists weeks after the event, as well as Dressler syndrome , an immune phenomenon characterized by pericarditis, pleuritis, and fever. Dressler syndrome may remit and relapse, and it is treated with anti-inflammatory drugs, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and sometimes prednisone.\n\n【27】#### POST-MI RISK STRATIFICATION\n\n【28】The goal is to identify patients who are at high risk for subsequent cardiac events and who might benefit from revascularization. The initial evaluation involves noninvasive testing. Submaximal exercise stress testing is generally performed in stable patients before hospital discharge to detect residual ischemia and ventricular ectopy and to provide a guideline for exercise in the early recovery period. Evaluation of LV systolic function , usually with echocardiography, is routinely performed. High-risk patients include those with impaired systolic function, large areas of ischemic myocardium on stress testing or postinfarction angina, or ventricular ectopy who might benefit from coronary angiography to evaluate for revascularization. Percutaneous coronary intervention can be performed to reduce anginal symptoms, and coronary artery bypass surgery should be considered for patients with multivessel atherosclerotic stenosis and impaired systolic function because the surgery may reduce symptoms and prolong survival. Post-STEMI patients with LV dysfunction (LV ejection fraction <40%) are at increased risk for sudden cardiac death from ventricular arrhythmias and may benefit from placement of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).\n\n【29】#### SECONDARY PREVENTION OF ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE\n\n【30】Medical therapy to reduce modifiable risk factors is the cornerstone of post-MI care. In addition to symptom relief, the major goal of medical therapy is to prevent cardiac events: fatal or nonfatal MI. By far, the most important risk factor is smoking cessation . Quitting tobacco use can reduce the risk of fatal or nonfatal cardiac events by more than 50%, more than any other medical or surgical therapy available. A number of other therapies reduce the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events and prolong survival in patients with coronary artery disease. Antiplatelet agents such as aspirin and clopidogrel reduce the risk of thrombus formation, beta-blockers reduce myocardial oxygen demand and may help suppress ventricular arrhythmias, and cholesterol-lowering agents such as statins reduce the number of coronary events and prolong survival. Patients with established coronary artery disease (CAD) should have a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level less than 70 mg/dL. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are recommended for all patients after STEMI but are most important for patients with impaired systolic function (ejection fraction <40%), diabetes, or hypertension.\n\n【31】####", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 13:54:27", "endTime": "2024/09/12 13:55:17", "cost": 49.746}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:28", "update_time": "2024-09-11 21:55:15", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 21:54:25"}

He does not willingly  删除换行 engage in questions related to the soiling but will answer questions about more general issues. \n\n【8】He is somewhat small for his age.\n\n【9】Physical examination shows he has a small abdominal mass, and rectal examination and  删除换行 abdominal X-ray show that he is constipated.\n\n【10】Question\n\n【11】• How would you manage this situation?删除5：<u>234</u>\n删除7：<u>100 Cases in Psychiatry</u>\nANSWER 85\n\n【12】Differential diagnosis would include constipation and anal fissure causing retention and  删除换行 leading to a vicious cycle of bowel loading and dysfunction. However, the deliberate soiling  删除换行 and the history suggest emotional and behavioural disturbance. Attachment problems are  删除换行 likely given the history of current neglect and history of abuse.

The smearing is not likely to be organic, but physical and psychological  删除换行 causes can coexist. In many respects the behaviour represents maladaptive coping strategies.\n\n【13】Encopresis (involuntary soiling) is more likely to occur in boys than girls.

She has also noticed an increase in her weight (espe-cially in the trunk region) and easy fatigability. She denies any medical problems. Her periods were always normal until 6 months ago， and her hir-sutism has been gradual in onset. On examination， she has a very rounded hir-sute face with centripetal obesity. Her blood pressure is elevated， as is her weight compared with previous visits. On abdominal examination， she is noted to have striae and a male-like distribution of hair on the lower abdomen.

ACTH contains the MSH fragment， and when it is elevated (primary adrenocortical insufficiency)， hyperpigmentation may occur.\n\n【9】CLINICAL CORRELATION\n\n【10】Cushing syndrome is a condition caused by increased cortisol production. This increase may be the result of overproduction of ACTH (Cushing disease) or excess production of cortisol by the adrenal gland (adrenal hyperplasia). A patient’s symptoms may include truncal obesity， a round“moon”face， a“buf-falo hump，\"hypertension， fatigability and weakness， amenorrhea， hirsutism， abdominal striae， osteoporosis， and hyperglycemia. The diagnosis is presumed when there is increased cortisol production and failure to suppress cortisol secretion with dexamethasone. The level of ACTH will help differentiate whether the problem is from overproduction of ACTH or from increased adre-nal cortisol production. Treatment depends on the etiology.Overproduction from an ACTH-secreting tumor usually requires surgical intervention. Medical management of adrenal hyperplasia may include the use of ketoconazole or other medications that inhibit steroidogenesis.\n\n【11】APPROACH TO ADRENAL PHYSIOLOGY\n\n【12】Objectives 删除换行 1Understand the structure of the adrenal cortex and medulla.删除5：<u>23</u>\nKnow about regulation of adrenocortical hormones.\n\n【13】Understand the actions of adrenocortical hormones.\n\n【14】Definitions\n\n【15】1\\. Glucocorticoids： Steroid hormones， primarily cortisol， secreted by the adrenal cortex that promote the synthesis of enzy mes involved in energy balance and fuel utilization. They have potent immunosuppressant and 删除换行 anti-inflammatory activities and their secretion is increased in response to stress.\n\n【16】2\\. Mineralocorticoids： Steroid hormones， primarily aldosterone， that are secreted by the adrenal cortex and are essential for the maintenance of salt and water balance by the kidney.\n\n【17】3\\. ACTH： Adrenocorticotrophic hormone is secreted by the anterior pitu-itary gland and directly controls the rate of production of the glucocor-ticoids and androgens by the adrenal cortex.\n\n【18】DISCUSSION\n\n【19】The suprarenal， or adrenal， glands are a pair of structures just above the kidneys. The adrenals form a complex structure consisting of functionally and morphologically distinct regions： an outer region， the adrenal cortex， and the inner medulla. The adrenal cortex is the site of synthesis and secretion of steroid hormones known as the mineralocorticoids， the glucocorticoids， and the androgens. The bulk of the adrenal gland is the cortex， which is com-posed of morphologically and functionally distinct segments. Descending into the gland just below the capsule is the zona glomerulosa， clusters of cells that secrete the mineralocorticoid aldosterone. The zona fasciculata penetrates deeply into the cortex and overlays the zona reticularis. These two regions produce the glucocorticoids and the adrenal androgens. The innermost region is the medulla. The adrenal medulla is heavily innervated and is a source of the circulating sympathetic hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine.\n\n【20】Regulation of Adrenal Cortical Hormone Secretion\n\n【21】The rate of secretion of the adrenal cortical hormones is dependent on their rate of production. Unlike the peptide hormones， for example， the steroid hor-mones are permeable to the plasma membranes of cells， and their concentra-tion in the cell is the determinant of the rate at which they leave the cell and enter the plasma. In the plasma， they bind to and are transported by globular proteins such as corticosteroid-binding protein and albumin. The adrenal cor-tical hormones act on target tissues by diffusing into the cell and forming a complex with a specific intracellular receptor. Complex formation exposes a DNA-binding site and is translocated into the nucleus. In the nucleus， the hor-mone-receptor complex binds to a specific site on the DNA target molecule， the hormone responsive element， and enhances or inhibits gene transcription.\n\n【22】The production of glucocorticoids and androgens is directly controlled by ACTH. ACTH binds to a receptor on the cell surface which mediates the acti-vation of the enzymes involved in the synthesis of pregnenolone， the precur-sor molecule of adrenocortical hormones produced in the zona fasciculata and the zona reticularis. ACTH actions result in the direct activation of enzymatic activities and a slower increase in the synthesis of these enzymes. Cortisol secretion normally follows that of ACTH， with a diurnal pattern of secretion 删除换行 peaking in the early morning hours. ACTH is produced in the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland in response to hypothalamic release of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) from the paraventricular nuclei. The circulating level of cortisol is regulated by a negative feedback control of ACTH secre-tion. Cortisol inhibits ACTH secretion by acting directly on the ACTH-producing cells and indirectly by inhibition of the hypothalamic neuronal release of CRH. The mechanism of cortisol inhibition involves cortisol bind-ing to corticosteroid receptors in these tissues and inhibition of specific gene transcription.\n\n【23】Cushing syndrome is often the result of increased pituitary secretion of ACTH because of a pituitary adenoma. There are however other types of tumors (outside the pituitary) that secrete ACTH and stimulate cortisol pro-duction. To help identify the cause of the elevated cortisol a test is conducted with the administration of dexamethasone， a synthetic analog of cortisol， to inhibit ACTH release and thus cortisol production. The failure to lower corti-sol production indicates a nonpituitary source of the problem.\n\n【24】Physiology of Glucocorticoids\n\n【25】Cortisol has a permissive effect on a number of enzymes that mediate the breakdown of fats and protein and hepatic glucose production and is essential for the maintenance of energy balance and fuel utilization in the body. Cortisol also has potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant activi-ties that make it an extremely important therapeutic agent. The glucocorti-coids， primarily cortisol and to a lesser extent corticosterone， play a central role in the physiologic response to stress， and their secretion is increased dur-ing stress. Factors such as surgery，hypoglycemia， and pain stimulate ACTH secretion and consequently stimulate cortisol production and secretion. Severely stressful conditions will override both diurnal ACTH production and the feedback inhibition of cortisol on ACTH secretion， resulting in a sustained ACTH level and maximal levels of cortisol production.\n\n【26】The physiology of the glucocorticoids is complex and can influence and alter the function of every system in the body. The dominant and most crucial functions involve energy metabolism through the control of the expression of proteins that are essential for the maintenance of energy balance during peri-ods of food deprivation. During periods of fasting， the body rapidly exhausts its carbohydrate supplies and depends on other sources of fuel for metabolic energy. In the liver， cortisol increases the synthesis of enzymes in the gluco-neogenic pathway， as well as enzymes in muscle tissue for the breakdown of proteins to provide glucogenic precursors for glucose synthesis. Glucocorticoid-dependent enzymes catalyze the breakdown of fats through lipolysis to gen-erate free fatty acids and keto acids for energy production. The combined effect of these actions is to decrease glucose utilization by providing alternate fuels and to maintain plasma glucose levels for tissues that have an absolute requirement for glucose as oxidizable substrate.\n\n【27】Corticosteroids have potent anti-inflammatory activity. Tissue injury or other stimuli lead to an increased production of the arachidonic acid deriv-atives， prostaglandins and leukotrienes. The injury activates a phospholi-pase (PLA，) that releases arachidonic acid from phospholipids. The newly formed arachidonic acid then is converted to the prostaglandin structure by a cyclooxygenase. Physiologically， prostaglandins have localized effects of dilating the vessels in the area of the injury and sensitizing the nerve endings and increasing the sensation of pain.\n\n【28】Glucocorticoids are also negative regulators of cytokine production， partic-ularly interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor-o(TNF-0) and numerous other mediators. These cytokines are produced primarily in macrophages after stimulation by immune complexes and arachidonic acid metabolites and after injury. In addition to inhibiting their production， the steps outlined above identify loci where glucocorticoids interfere with the signaling pathways and the actions of their products. IL-1 production by macrophages plays a central role in the immune response； thus， glucocorticoids are immunosuppressive. The glucocorticoids are effective immunosuppressive agents and are an important therapeutic tool. Proliferation of β-lymphocytes requires cytokines released from helper T cells. Glucocorticoids inhibit macrophage and T-cell cytokine production， which reduces B-cell proliferation. T-cell proliferation is induced by IL-2after exposure to an antigen. Glucocorticoids inhibit IL-2 production， thereby reducing T-cell proliferation. By these mechanisms， glucocorticoids are able to suppress both humeral and cellular immune responses.\n\n【29】The Physiology of Mineralocorticoids\n\n【30】The mineralocorticoids， primarily aldosterone， are essential for the mainte-nance of salt and water balance by the kidney by regulating sodium reab-sorption and potassium secretion. Aldosterone is produced in the zona glomerulosa from the common pregnenolone precursor. Regulation of aldos-terone secretion is dependent on several factors. ACTH-dependent preg-nenolone synthesis is required for maximal aldosterone production， but secretion is controlled directly by angiotensin II and the extracellular (\\[K\\\\]) potassium concentration. Increasing plasma \\[K\\\\] stimulates aldosterone secre-tion. Atrial natriuretic factor has a negative modulatory effect on aldosterone secretion. As with the other adrenal cortical hormones， aldosterone binds to and is carried in the blood by corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG).\n\n【31】The physiologic role of aldosterone is the maintenance of fluid and elec-trolyte balance， and its secretion is tightly coupled to the vascular volume. A decrease in vascular volume initiates a cascade response with an increase in renal renin secretion from smooth muscle cells of the afferent glomerular arteriole. Renin catalyzes the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II. The target of angiotensin II is the zona glomerulosa， which responds by increasing the production and secretion of aldosterone.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 14:32:58", "endTime": "2024/09/12 14:44:36", "cost": 698.375}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:28", "update_time": "2024-09-11 22:44:37", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 22:32:58"}

The patient denies recent trauma to the area， but states she had her second toe amputated by her podiatrist 6 months ago， secondary to an infection she con-tracted \"from a pebble in \\[her\\] shoe.\" Although her foot had healed， she has begun experiencing a recurrence of pain in this area， despite a change in footwear and diligent monitoring of her feet for ulcers. She admits to mild fevers over the past10 days， but denies other symptoms. On further history， the patient has type 2diabetes mellitus. She admits that she stopped seeing her primary care physician last year since he started prescribing“painful insulin shots” for her. On physical exam， erythema is noted at the plantar-medial aspect of her right forefoot. This region is warm to the touch， mildly edematous， and firm， but without any obvi-ous fluctuance or drainage. She has chronic neuropathies in her toes and feet， bilaterally. Recent laboratory results from her primary care provider's office are remarkable for a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7.4 thousand/uL， erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 55 mm/hr， and C-reactive protein (CRP) of 65 mg/L.

She has mild systemic symptoms (fever) and has experienced similar symptoms in the past for which she underwent an amputation of her second toe.\n\n【5】Radiologic findings： This AP radiograph of the right foot shows chronic bone and soft tissue loss in the second ray， consistent with the patient’s history of osteomyelitis and toe amputation. There is significant soft tissue swelling over the head of the first metatarsal and base of the great toe. There is also significant bony erosion in this region， with a loss of normal cortical bone， periosteal eleva-tion， and lytic changes consistent with osteomyelitis. On T2-weighted MRI， the head and distal shaft of the first metatarsal are hyper-resonant， consistent with edema and inflammation in the region. There is also adjacent hyperinten-sity of the soft tissues medial to the great toe， consistent with soft tissue inflam-mation and possibly an abscess collection.\n\n【6】● Most likely diagnosis： Osteomyelitis of the first ray.\n\n【7】· Predisposing factors： Poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus， peripheral neuropathy， and history of previous osteomyelitis.\n\n【8】ANALYSIS\n\n【9】Objectives\n\n【10】1\\. Understand the pathogenesis of osteomyelitis and recognize its clinical and radiographic presentation.\n\n【11】2\\. Be familiar with the differential diagnoses for， and diagnostic workup of， osteomyelitis.\n\n【12】3\\. Be familiar with basic treatment options for osteomyelitis， both operative and nonoperative.\n\n【13】Considerations\n\n【14】This patient presents with a soft tissue infection that has progressed to involve the underlying metatarsal bone. She has a history of uncontrolled diabetes and neuropathy. As a risk factor for osteomyelitis， neuropathies predispose patients to microtrauma because the body's pain-protective response to skin-damaging repetitive wear is lost. Previously， this patient’s neuropathy left her susceptible to skin ulceration from a pebble in her shoe， which wore through the protec-tive dermal barrier and introduced bacteria into the soft tissues overlying the second metatarsal. Poorly controlled diabetes impedes the body's wound heal-ing and infection-fighting capabilities， rendering diabetics susceptible to bacte-rial colonization， particularly in their feet. Radiographic studies should be used 删除换行 to further investigate and diagnose osteomyelitis： plain radiographs， computed tomography (CT) scans， MRI， WBC scans， and/or bone scans are used to make the diagnosis. In this patient’s case， plain x-rays clearly show erosive bony changes in the first ray， while T2-weighted MRI shows edematous changes in the bone and surrounding soft tissues consistent with osteomyelitis. This patient has an elevated ESR and CRP， which are elevated in more than 90% of cases of osteomyelitis. An elevated WBC count， although positive in many types of infections and inflamma-tory states， is only positive in approximately 40% of cases.\n\n【15】Once the diagnosis is made， the patient should be admitted to the hospital and intravenous antibiotic therapy should commence. If deep tissue or bone biopsy can be easily obtained， and if the patient remains stable， antibiotic therapy may be delayed until biopsies or aspirations are acquired. This is especially true in patients for whom osteomyelitis represents one in several possible diagnoses or when osteomyelitis is occurring in particularly difficult to debride regions such as vertebral bodies. Biopsy before antibiotic administration optimizes the chance that an adequate sample of bacteria will be acquired for culture and that an appropriate， targeted antibiotic agent may be selected. Unstable patients with evidence of sepsis， however， should receive prompt systemic antibiotic treatment， regardless of whether biopsy can be performed. An additional caveat involves the culturing of superficial tissues， as these cultures tend to grow out benign， typical skin flora， which some-times leads to the unnecessary and misdirected treatment.\n\n【16】For this patient， with extensive involvement of deep tissues， surgical drainage and debridement should be performed. Amputation may also be considered.Intra-venous antibiotic therapy typically continues for 4 to 6 weeks， with infectious dis-1SF ease consultation useful for assistance with antibiotic selection and management.\n\n【17】APPROACHTO：\n\n【18】ACUTE OSTEOMYELITIS： Presence of bacteria or infectious pathogens in bone or bone marrow without the chronic histologic changes described below. Defined in some literature as a bone infection lasting less than 6 weeks. Acute osteomyelitis most commonly occurs in children.\n\n【19】CHRONIC OSTEOMYELITIS： May be defined by histologic changes such as the presence of a sequestrum or an involucrum， or by duration of infection greater than6 weeks. Chronic osteomyelitis is characterized by the presence of bacterial biofilm and bacterial resistance to host defenses and antibiotic agents and often requires surgical debridement and long-term systemic antibiotic therapy.\n\n【20】BIOFILM： An aggregate of microorganisms embedded within an adherent poly-saccharide matrix that provides bacterial immunity to host cellular defenses and antiobiotic agents.\n\n【21】SEQUESTRUM： A region of devitalized bone that serves as a nidus for continual infection； a hallmark of chronic osteomyelitis.\n\n【22】INVOLUCRUM： The formation of new， reactive bone around an area of septic necrosis； another hallmark of chronic osteomyelitis.\n\n【23】Pathophysiology\n\n【24】Osteomyelitis is an infection of bone or bone marrow. This highly variable disease may be classified as acute versus chronic， hematogenous versus contiguous， and with or without vascular compromise (Lee and Waldvogel classification). Osteomyelitis may also be classified by its location and extent (Cierny and Mader classification).\n\n【25】Osteomyelitis can result from a continuous spread of an infection from soft tissue or joints， trauma causing direct bacterial inoculation into bone or adjacent soft tissues， or hematogenously spread from an infection elsewhere in the body.\n\n【26】Patients with vascular diseases， poorly controlled diabetes， and those in states of immunocompromise are at elevated risk for developing acute osteomyelitis. Immunocompromised individuals are also at risk for developing chronic osteomyelitis. Other risk factors for chronic osteomyelitis include history of intravenous drug abuse and failure of treatment of acute osteomyelitis.\n\n【27】Osteomyelitis can be caused by bacteria， fungi， and viruses. By a great major-ity， the most common causative agents are bacterial， with Staphylococcus aureus being the most commonly identified offending organism. Other common inoculants include Pseudomonas aeruginosa， Escherichia coli， coagulase-negative staphylococci， enterococci， and propionibacteria. Salmonella species are commonly identified pathogens in patients with sickle-cell anemia； however， staphylococcal species are still most common in these patients.\n\n【28】Diagnosis\n\n【29】Osteomyelit is may present as an occult infection in patients of all ages. Its most com-mon presentation is in patients with deep bone pain and without significant systemic symptoms. When systemic symptoms are present， fever and chills predominate. Soft tissues surrounding an infection may be edematous， warm， and erythematous. Patients may present with a history of recent trauma or infection or with a history of an invasive procedure. Osteomyelitis should be included in the differential diagnosis of other musculoskeletal pathologies such as gout， ischemia， arthritis， neuropathy， and degenerative disc disease in the spine. Delay in diagnosis and treatment of acute infection may lead to chronic osteomyelitis， a relapsing and remitting indolent infec-tion characterized by intermittent pain attacks and systemic symptoms.\n\n【30】Radiographic Evaluation\n\n【31】Plain radiographs should be obtained before more advanced imaging is considered. On plain films， acute osteomyelitis may be identified by cortical bone destruction with a surrounding area of periosteal elevation. Acute osteomyelitis will typically have a lytic， or radiolucent， appearance， whereas chronic infections may be dis-tinguished by the presence of a mixed lytic and blastic， or radio-opaque， appear-ance. Radiographs are not sensitive for osteomyelitis， however， as up to 30% to40% of bone destruction must occur before osteomyelitic changes are visible on 删除换行 plain x-rays. Symptoms of the disease typically are present before x-ray changes are apparent.\n\n【32】MRI with intravenous (IV) gadolinium contrast is far more sensitive for diagnosing osteomyelitis. MRI offers a clear view of soft tissue pathology and is currently the gold standard in the diagnosis of osteomyelitis. Be wary that in the presence of metallic implants， the sensitive/specificity of MRI is decreased； in such situations， IV contrast CT scans may be helpful in elucidating bony pathology.\n\n【33】Finally， radioisotope tagged WBC scans are very specific for osteomyelitis and are often used to follow treatment progression. Bone scans may be used in a similar fashion， but are less specific.\n\n【34】Acute osteomyelitis， typically presenting in children and ⅣV drug abusers with erythematous and painful limbs， requires prompt antibiotic therapy， often 4 to6 weeks' duration. Such patients may not require surgical debridement， but should be followed closely to ensure successful therapy.\n\n【35】Chronic osteomyelitis also requires long-term IV drug therapy， but typically requires additional open surgical procedures to debride necrotic tissue， drain abscesses， and remove sequestra or nonviable bone serving as nidi for bacteria.\n\n【36】In chronic osteomyelitis， IV antibiotic is typically administered for 4 to 6 weeks and may be administered in an outpatient setting once a patient has been sta-bilized. In patients with extensive disease or immunocompromised states， longer courses of IV drug therapy may be indicated. Initial antibiotic coverage should be broad， with tailored antibiotic selection once， and only if， reliable bacterial cul-tures and drug sensitivities are available. Initial antibiotic selection must cover S. aureus， the most commonly identified pathogen in osteomyelitis. In patients with a history of recent hospitalization， initial therapy must cover methicillin-resistant S. aureus， a prevalent nosocomial infection. Serial CRP and ESR studies， although not especially specific for osteomyelitis， are sometimes followed as markers for suc-cessful treatment.\n\n【37】In addition to a thorough surgical debridement， several adjunctive surgical treatments may be indicated， including the placement of antibiotic-eluting poly-methyl-methacrylate (PMMA) beads. PMMA， the same bone “cement”used in the implantation of joint prostheses， may be mixed with antibiotic agents such as gentamycin， molded into round beads or fashioned into an antibiotic spacer， and placed into the debrided cavity. After resolution of infection， the beads are typically removed.\n\n【38】The placement of orthopaedic implants such as screws， plates， rods， and prosthe-ses pose a special challenge to the orthopaedist， as artificial implants may serve as a nidus for chronic infection. In such cases， the surgeon must weight the benefits of removing infected hardware with the risks of losing stability or function. As a gen-eral rule， infected hardware should be removed when possible.\n\n【39】Outcomes and Complications\n\n【40】Musculoskeletal infection that has been treated with antibiotics and surgical debride-ment can lead to functional deficit in the given extremity. This is dependent on the 删除换行 amount of tissue debrided and if vital structures have been violated and destabilized. When this occurs， it is usually in an attempt to perform a limb-salvage procedure， as both patients and surgeons try to avoid amputation if at all possible. However， in the setting of severe and recurrent musculoskeletal infections， amputation may be the only means by which to permanently eradicate the infection.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 13:41:38", "endTime": "2024/09/12 13:42:36", "cost": 57.871}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:28", "update_time": "2024-09-11 21:42:35", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 21:41:37"}

She had no symptoms， physi-cal examination was not suggestive for under- or over-replacement with glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid therapy， and her electrolytes were within the normal range. Thus no changes in hydrocortisone and fludro-cortisone were made.\n\n【7】Before the planned cesarean section， her medical team followed the plan agreed on between her endocri-nologist and obstetrician to inject 100 mg of hydrocor-tisone solution， followed by 50 mg every 6 hours until able to have oral intake. At that point， she took oral hydrocortisone at slightly increased dose of 20 mg on waking， 10 mg at noon， and 5 mg at 5 PM for 1 week， and then reverted to her prepregnancy regimen.\n\n【8】When appropriately managed， women with adrenal insufficiency experience excellent fetal and maternal outcomes.Usually an adjustment in daily hydrocorti-sone dose is needed in the second or third trimester 1-3The need for adjustment depends on prepregnancy glucocorticoid dose and clinical assessment during pregnancy. Because progesterone has an antiminer-alocorticoid effect， fludrocortisone therapy may need to be modified during pregnancy.Assessment of\n\n| Patient and Clinician-Related Measures to Ensure Appropriate Management of  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| TABLE 98.1  |  |\n| Adrenal Insufficiency and Prevention of Adrenal Crisis  |  |\n| Patient  | Clinician  |\n| Chronic Management of Adrenal Insufficiency  |  |\n| Consistency with taking hydrocortisone and  | Provide a written adrenal action plan that includes both  |\n| fludrocortisone exactly as prescribed  | standard glucocorticoid replacement and increased doses  |\n| Understanding symptoms of under- and overreplacement  | at times of illness (i.e.， sick day guidelines).  |\n| with glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids to effectively  | Evaluate for appropriate glucocorticoid and  |\n| communicate dosing issues to the health care team  | mineralocorticoid replacement during each visit.  |\n| Ensuring an optimal supply of hydrocortisone and  | Provide an optimal supply of medications， including for  |\n| fludrocortisone tablets and injectable glucocorticoid  | the times of a need to increase.  |\n| (including during travel)  |  |\n| Prevention and Treatment of Adrenal Crisis  |  |\n| Participation in an education session on sick day  | Educate patients on importance of wearing medical alert  |\n| guidelines  | identification and maintaining a copy of adrenal action  |\n| Taking stress dose glucocorticoids when indicated  | plan for cases of emergency.  |\n| Understanding the situations when stress dose  | Review indications for stress dose glucocorticoid at every  |\n| glucocorticoids are required  | visit and maintain an active prescription for injectable  |\n| Compliance with wearing medical alert identification (e.g.，  | glucocorticoid.  |\n| bracelet， necklace)  | Provide education for emergency department staff  |\n| Availability of injectable glucocorticoid and comfort with  | regarding identification and prompt management of  |\n| administration if needed  | adrenal crisis.  |\n\n【10】Adapted from refs. 2， 4， and 5.\n\n【11】mineralocorticoid replacement therapy should rely on the physical examination (blood pressure measure-ment) and electrolyte assessment. Notably， plasma renin concentrations increase during pregnancy and should not be used in decision making. It is impor-tant to provide a detailed education on management during sickness and the importance of prevention of adrenal crisis .4.5 In addition， the patient’s obstetrical team and the patient should be well aware of the glucocorticoid plans for during labor， delivery， and postpartum period.\n\n【12】Key Points\n\n【13】Glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid manage-ment during pregnancy may change in women with adrenal insufficiency and is based on clinical assessment.\n\n【14】●As plasma renin concentrations increase with pregnancy， measurement of renin is not helpful to guide mineralocorticoid replacement. Clinical 删除换行 assessment and measurement of serum electro-lytes should be used instead.\n\n【15】●All patients with adrenal insufficiency need an adequate plan for stress dose glucocorticoids dur-ing labor and delivery.\n删除20：<u>1\\.

His blood pressure is 180/90 mm Hg and heart rate is 135/min. After a complete work-up, the patient is diagnosed with a pheochromocytoma, and his physician recommends surgery.

This patient has a pheochromocytoma, a chromaffin cell tumor of the adrenal medulla that secretes excess epinephrine and norepinephrine. Signs and symptoms of pheochromocytoma include episodic hypertension, headache, sweating, tachycardia, palpitations, and pallor. Pheochromocytomas may occur sporadically or as part of the MEN syndromes, which are a group of autosomal dominant syndromes in which more than one endocrine organ is dysfunctional. Given his history of thyroid carcinoma requiring a thryoidectomy, this patient most likely has MEN type II, which is characterized by the combination of medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, pheochromocytoma, and parathyroid hyperplasia. Pheochromocytomas are treated surgically, but must first be managed preoperatively with both a nonselective α-antagonist (usually phenoxybenzamine) to normalize blood pressure, followed by a β-blocker (eg, propranolol) to control tachycardia. The β-blocker should never be started prior to α-blockade because it would result in unopposed α-receptor stimulation, leading to a further elevation in blood pressure.  \n\n【6】Answer B is incorrect . Pheochromocytomas are treated surgically, but must first be managed preoperatively with both a nonselective α-antagonist (usually phenoxybenzamine) to normalize blood pressure, followed by a β-blocker (eg, propranolol) to control tachycardia. The β-blocker should never be started prior to α-blockade because it would result in unopposed α-receptor stimulation, leading to a further elevation in blood pressure.  \n\n【7】Answer C is incorrect . Levothyroxine is thyroid hormone replacement that is used to treat hypothyroidism and myxedema. It is not indicated in the treatment of pheochromocytoma.  \n\n【8】Answer D is incorrect . Prednisone is a glucocorticoid that is used to treat many inflammatory, allergic, and immunologic disorders, but is not indicated in the treatment of pheochromocytoma.  \n\n【9】Answer E is incorrect .

It also broadens the scope of this hypothesis to embrace children and adolescents who are not yet mature or competent enough to fully engage in autonomous, goal-directed behavior.\n\n【9】#### Freedom\n\n【10】Existential philosophy has the concept of freedom at its core. Humans are not “things” with a fixed essence that can be defined and categorized by a set of descriptors. Instead, they are in a state of being and becoming and always have the ability to exercise choice. When people claim that they are in situations with no choice, they are empowered by learning the words of Viktor Frankl 通用删除7(英):<u>(1997)</u>, following his experiences in Nazi concentrations camps: “Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way” . Applying labels to people and putting them into categories is a way of negating their freedom. Hence, from the existential perspective, psychiatric diagnosis is a way of denying the freedom of our clients to use their free will to change.\n\n【11】For children and adolescents, the concept of freedom means “I can do whatever I want.” However, in adulthood, the exercise of freedom is demonstrated through “volitional action” 删除10：<u>(D. Shapiro, 1981)</u>: “Needs, interests, wishes, the opportunities of circumstances—instead of triggering reactions as in infancy—generate interest in the possibilities of action” . Psychology addresses freedom with many terms—autonomy, self-direction, and self-regulation. We mean, by this language, that the source of motivation comes from within, and the locus of control is internal. Impulsive behavior does not represent autonomy because the behavior is controlled by biological drives, strong emotions and cravings, or the immediate surroundings. True freedom requires the capacity to maintain an intention in the face of obstacles and immediate temptations, and involves the experience of being one’s own master. In other words, without self-control, there is no freedom.\n\n【12】There is an extensive research literature on self-regulation 删除10：<u>(e.g. Karoly, Boekaerts, & Maes, 2005; Maes & Karoly, 2005; Purdie & McCrindle, 2002; Rasmussen, Wrosch, Scheier, & Carver, 2006)</u> that examines self-determined goals and self-reflective implementation of actions aimed at specific outcomes. Research on delay of gratification and the resistance to temptation in children 删除10：<u>(e.g. Metcalfe & Mischel, 1999)</u> illustrates the difference between impulsivity and autonomous action, and how to promote the latter. Self-determination has been studied by Ryan and Deci 通用删除7(英):<u>(2000, 2008)</u>; they are interested in the facilitation of intrinsic motivation and how individuals learn a process of delay after experiencing emotions so that they can make a reflective choice about whether to express them.\n\n【13】The question of freedom enters into one of the greatest challenges to therapists (not to mention parents, physicians, and economists): Why do people do what they know is not in their own best interest? Once a person decides that a specific self-enhancing goal is desirable (e.g. weight loss, safe sex, completing a college degree), why is she not able to get her own behavior to conform to her stated intentions? In the field of health, this can be a life-and-death question; interventions for people with chronic illnesses that focus on developing self-management competencies are effective in creating long-lasting positive health outcomes (Barlow, Wright, Turner, & Bancroft, 2005; Newman, Steed, & Mulligan, 2004).\n\n【14】### Necessity and Limitations\n\n【15】Wheelis 通用删除7(英):<u>(1975)</u>, an existential psychotherapist, distinguished two types of necessity:\n\n【16】1.  Mandatory necessity : Forces, conditions, and events that lie beyond the self and cannot be changed by choice, will, or effort. ( I can’t return to my home because it was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina. I have to get liability insurance if I want to register my car. )\n2.  Arbitrary necessity : Forces within the personality but construed to be outside: the person acts as if there is no choice and experiences herself as yielding to external necessity, instead of realizing that the mandate or prohibition can be suspended or disobeyed. ( I can’t go to graduate school because I’m too old. I have to shop in discount stores and not pay retail prices. )\n\n【17】It is important to use critical thinking to distinguish between the two types. This idea is expressed more poetically in the well-known “serenity” prayer, credited to Reinhold Niebuhr and used by Alcoholics Anonymous and other 12-step programs: God, grant me the serenity/To accept the things I cannot change;/Courage to change the things I can;/And wisdom to know the difference.\n\n【18】By confusing the two types of necessity, people are at risk for two kinds of errors:\n\n【19】1.  Self-imposed limitations: When people create limitations that do not exist in reality, they become passive in areas in which change is possible. Therapists frequently face clients who feel trapped, immobilized, powerless, and out of control of their own lives. Although to an outside observer they could easily make new choices to create a happier life, they do not experience themselves as free. Another manifestation of this error is much more subtle: People may believe that they make choices freely, and lack awareness of how they arbitrarily limit their possibilities. They may be operating from past conditioning, based on rewards and punishments from parents or from beliefs and values that were accepted from authorities and never critically examined. For instance, a client who calls himself a “workaholic” believes that he freely chooses to place work above other activities in life, although his choices were shaped by the fact that working hard and getting academic awards was compensation for being rejected by his peers.\n2.  The illusion of freedom, when there are objective constraints: There are clients who are convinced that they have unlimited possibilities and that the limitations that constrain others do not apply to them. They act impulsively, letting chips fall where they may, and move from one path to another without ever making successful, lasting commitments. A failure to recognize limitations can lead to futile efforts to create change in situations where it is impossible to have control, resulting in feelings of frustration, rage, and helplessness.\n\n【20】### Freedom and Culture\n\n【21】A certain degree of questioning of cultural norms is necessary for people to freely develop their unique potential and choose the path that has heart for them. Doing what is expected, being a good child, and being part of the crowd are paths that allow one to safely avoid a sense of freedom. People also look to a group larger than themselves—as teenagers look to their peer group—to decide what is fashionable and appropriate. Choices are based on what everyone else is doing, and possibilities are ignored if they bring ridicule or shame. Acceptance and approval from others become more important than discovering your own needs, talents, and desires. Becker, in his book The Denial of Death 通用删除7(英):<u>(1973)</u>, explained how people seek a sense of enduring, absolute truth through “immortality systems” such as religious groups, political philosophies, or cultural activities. Because they need to hold on to the righteous feeling that they have found absolute truth, they tend to be aggressively intolerant of people who have different truths. A component of real freedom is having an open mind to let new and disturbing ideas enter for your own independent evaluation, rather than having a rigid mental gatekeeper to screen out anything that does not fit what you already have decided to believe.\n\n【22】It is a distortion of the meaning of freedom to suggest that the exercise of self-determination will automatically lead to a rejection of the norms and customs of one’s culture. The structures and constraints offered by a culture can provide the very conditions that promote a sense of freedom. Pittman 通用删除7(英):<u>(1998)</u>, a psychiatrist and family therapist, made that point about marriage: “Marriage is not supposed to make you happy. It is supposed to make you married , and once you are safely and totally married, then you have a structure of security and support from which you are free to make yourself happy, rather than wasting your adulthood looking for a structure” . The point is not that people should be married but that people need to voluntarily restrict their own freedom to be most satisfied with life, and that cultural traditions may provide restrictions that are beneficial. There needs to be many available cultural options, and cultural support for different lifestyles. The battle over gay marriage is an example of how cultural restrictions can be challenged by social activists fighting for new freedoms.\n\n【23】Without question, an appreciation of individual freedom is a cultural value, and there are many cultures (and political regimes) that suppress rather than promote it. Does this mean that culturally sensitive therapists do not promote autonomous functioning in clients from those cultures? Are human rights a cultural invention or a higher value that supersedes claims of cultural customs? It might be argued that the Freedom and Responsibility hypothesis is culturally biased, but my opinion is that therapists who refrain from focusing on freedom and choice, instead of being culturally competent, may be demonstrating what Gerson (speechwriter to George W. Bush) called the “soft bigotry of low expectations.”", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "(Barlow, Wright, Turner, & Bancroft, 2005; Newman, Steed, & Mulligan, 2004)", "content": "【0】FREEDOM AND RESPONSIBILITY\n--------------------------\n\n【1】Freedom and Responsibility (ES2)\n================================\n\n【2】### Definition\n\n【3】The client is facing the challenges of Freedom and Responsibility and may need support in making good choices, commitments, and self-directed action plans.\n\n【4】### Explanation\n\n【5】Clients may need help in realizing that they have freedom to make choices and that they are responsible for the consequences of their choices. They need to distinguish between limitations that are real and those that are self-imposed. The avoidance of freedom takes many forms, such as maintenance of childhood illusions, blaming others, and depending on others to provide direction and rescue. When clients are ready to take action, they may need help in values clarification, decision making, planning, and implementation of plans.\n\n【6】### Examples\n\n| Larry (46, White) is very unhappy with his job in swimming pool maintenance. “If only I had finished college, everything would have been different.” He feels hopeless, and has no future orientation. He spoils his friendships with his envy of his friends’ professional and material success. Instead of recognizing their hard work and perseverance, he thinks, “It’s unfair that they have been so lucky.” | Julie (35, Latina) is an attractive woman who is “afraid of making a commitment.” She has repeatedly broken off engagements as the wedding day approaches. She claims that she is “terrified of growing up” and is tormented about “giving up my freedom.” When her friends get married she wonders, “How did they know that someone better wouldn’t come along?” | James (58, African-American) is a successful corporate executive who has lost interest in his career. He has all the money he needs and could afford to retire, but he admits he has no interests or hobbies and has no idea how he would spend his time.

The GP \n\n【3】was concerned enough to attempt a home visit, but on arrival Kate refused to come out of her  删除换行 room, saying that she was just having a break from the stresses of living.\n\n【4】Questions\n\n【5】• Could Kate be detained for assessment or treatment under the Mental Health Act?\n\n【6】• Should Kate be detained for assessment or treatment under the Mental Health Act?删除5：<u>124</u>\n删除7：<u>100 Cases in Clinical Ethics and Law</u>\nANSWER 47\n\n【7】The Mental Health Act 1983, amended in 2007, (MHA) enables a person to be detained for  删除换行 assessment of a mental disorder (Section 2) and, if a diagnosis has been made, to be detained  删除换行 for treatment (Section 3). Section 2 is generally used for first admissions, and if Kate had  删除换行 a known diagnosis she could be detained under Section 3. An admission for assessment lasts  删除换行 for a maximum of 28 days and it cannot be renewed, although a patient can at any time be  删除换行 detained under Section 3 instead. The application is usually made by an approved mental  删除换行 health professional (AMHP), and the person must be seen by two separate doctors, one of  删除换行 whom must have had specialist training.\n\n【8】Mental disorder is defined as ‘any disorder or disability of the mind’ and this is determined  删除换行 by relevant professionals in accordance with good clinical practice and accepted standards. \n\n【9】There is a broad spectrum of clinically recognised conditions including schizophrenia,  删除换行 bipolar disorder, severe depression, anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorders. Someone  删除换行 with a learning disability and no other form of mental disorder may not be detained for  删除换行 treatment unless their learning disability is accompanied by abnormally aggressive or seri删除8：<u>￾</u>ously irresponsible conduct. The aggressive behaviour must relate to the learning disability  删除换行 and not be attributable to other factors.\n\n【10】The purpose of the detention for assessment under Section 2 is to evaluate whether the person  删除换行 has a mental disorder and whether treatment is necessary. It can be authorised if the person\n\n【11】• is suffering from a mental disorder of a nature or degree which warrants her deten删除8：<u>￾</u>tion in hospital and\n\n【12】• ought to be detained in the interests of her own health or safety or with a view to the  删除换行 protection of others.\n\n【13】Consideration must be given to both the nature and degree of a person’s mental disorder.\n\n【14】Kate is not a risk to others, but her current obsessive and compulsive behaviours do seem to  删除换行 pose a risk to her health and well-being. There is a suggestion of self-neglect and self-harm,  删除换行 and her condition might deteriorate without treatment. Nevertheless there can be significant  删除换行 harms of detaining someone against their will. Kate may be very frightened and anxious  删除换行 and feel a real lack of control over her situation. She may distrust those who are seeking to  删除换行 help her, which could have adverse long-term consequences. Consideration should be given  删除换行 to alternative means of providing care and treatment which she would accept. A psychiatric  删除换行 outreach team may be able to become involved.\n\n【15】Compulsory detention and treatment is an infringement of personal autonomy. However,  删除换行 severe compulsive obsessive disorder would impair Kate’s ability to make an autonomous  删除换行 choice about how she behaves and the care and treatment she requires. If she can get effective  删除换行 treatment to ameliorate her distress and harmful effects of her disorder, and which thus may  删除换行 ultimately enhance her autonomy, then the harms of detention may be justified.\n\n【16】Key Points\n\n【17】• Mental health legislation enables compulsory detention for assessment and treat删除8：<u>￾</u>ment of a mental disorder.\n\n【18】• Whether someone should be detained against their wishes depends on the ben删除8：<u>￾</u>efits to be achieved balanced against the harms of detention.\n\n【19】• The aim should be to minimise the undesirable effects of mental disorder and  删除换行 maximise the safety and well-being of patients.删除5：<u>125</u>\n删除22：<u>Ethics and Law in Clinical Practice: Mental Health</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 14:06:04", "endTime": "2024/09/12 14:06:48", "cost": 44.52}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:28", "update_time": "2024-09-11 22:06:49", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 22:06:04"}

Approach to Reading\n\n【1】The clinical problem-oriented approach to reading is different from the classic “systematic” research of a disease. Patients rarely present with a clear diagnosis; hence, the student must become skilled in applying textbook information to the clinical scenario. Because reading with a purpose improves the retention of information, the student should read with the goal of answering specific questions. There are several fundamental questions that facilitate clinical thinking. These are:\n\n【2】1\\. What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【3】2\\. How would you confirm the diagnosis?\n\n【4】3\\. What should be your next step?\n\n【5】4\\. What is the best screening strategy in this situation?\n\n【6】5\\. What are the risk factors for this condition?\n\n【7】6\\. What are the complications associated with the disease process?\n\n【8】7\\. What is the best therapy?\n\n【9】CLINICAL PEARL\n\n【10】 Reading with the purpose of answering the seven fundamental clinical questions improves retention of information and facilitates the application of “book knowledge” to “clinical knowledge.”\n\n【11】### WHAT IS THE MOST LIKELY DIAGNOSIS?\n\n【12】The method of establishing the diagnosis was discussed in the previous section. One way of determining the most likely diagnosis is to develop standard “approaches” to common clinical problems. It is helpful to understand the most common causes of various presentations, such as “the worst headache of the patient’s life is worrisome for a subarachnoid hemorrhage” .\n\n【13】The clinical scenario would be something such as:\n\n【14】A 38-year-old woman is noted to have a 2-day history of unilateral, throbbing headache with photophobia. What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【15】With no other information to go on, the student would note that this woman has a unilateral headache with photophobia. Using the “most common cause” information, the student would make an educated guess that the patient has a migraine headache. If instead the patient is noted to have “the worst headache of her life,” the student would use the Clinical Pearl:\n\n【16】The worst headache of the patient’s life is worrisome for a subarachnoid hemorrhage .\n\n【17】CLINICAL PEARL\n\n【18】 The more common cause of a unilateral, throbbing headache with photophobia is a migraine, but the main concern is subarachnoid hemorrhage. If the patient describes this as “the worst headache of her life,” the concern for a subarachnoid bleed is increased.\n\n【19】### HOW WOULD YOU CONFIRM THE DIAGNOSIS?\n\n【20】In the scenario above, the woman with “the worst headache” is suspected of having a subarachnoid hemorrhage. This diagnosis could be confirmed by a CT scan of the head and/or lumbar puncture. The student should learn the limitations of various diagnostic tests, especially when used early in a disease process. The lumbar puncture (LP) showing xanthochromia (red blood cells) is the “gold standard” test for diagnosing subarachnoid hemorrhage, but it may be negative early in the disease course .\n\n【21】What should be your next step? This question is difficult because the next step has many possibilities; the answer may be to obtain more diagnostic information, stage the illness, or introduce therapy. It is often a more challenging question than “What is the most likely diagnosis?” because there may be insufficient information to make a diagnosis and the next step may be to pursue more diagnostic information. Another possibility is that there is enough information for a probable diagnosis, and the next step is to stage the disease. Finally, the most appropriate answer may be to treat. Hence, from clinical data, a judgment needs to be rendered regarding how far along one is on the road of:\n\n【22】1\\. Make the diagnosis → 2. Stage the disease → 3. Treat based on stage → 4. Follow response\n\n【23】Frequently, the student is taught “to regurgitate” the same information that someone has written about a particular disease, but is not skilled at identifying the next step. This talent is learned optimally at the bedside, in a supportive environment, with freedom to make educated guesses, and with constructive feedback. A sample scenario might describe a student’s thought process as follows:\n\n【24】1\\. Make the diagnosis: “Based on the information I have, I believe that the patient has a small bowel obstruction from adhesive disease because he presents with nausea and vomiting, abdominal distension, and high-pitched hyperactive bowel sounds, and has dilated loops of small bowel on x-ray.”\n\n【25】2\\. Stage the disease: “I don’t believe that this is severe disease as he does not have fever, evidence of sepsis, intractable pain, peritoneal signs, or leukocytosis.”\n\n【26】3\\. Treat based on stage: “Therefore, my next step is to treat with nothing per mouth, nasogastric (NG) tube drainage, IV fluids, and observation.”\n\n【27】4\\. Follow response: “I want to follow the treatment by assessing his pain (I will ask him to rate the pain on a scale of 1 to 10 every day), his bowel function (I will ask whether he has had nausea, vomiting, or passed flatus), his temperature, abdominal examination, serum bicarbonate (for metabolic acidemia), white blood cell count, and then reassess him in 48 hours.”\n\n【28】In a similar patient, when the clinical presentation is unclear, perhaps the best “next step” may be diagnostic such as an oral contrast radiologic study to assess for bowel obstruction.\n\n【29】CLINICAL PEARL\n\n【30】 Usually, the vague query, “What is your next step?” is the most difficult question because the answer may be diagnostic, staging, or therapeutic.\n\n【31】### WHAT IS THE BEST SCREENING STRATEGY IN THIS SITUATION?\n\n【32】A major role of the family physician is screening for common and/or dangerous conditions where there may be interventions to alleviate disease. Cost-effectiveness, ease of the screening modality, wide availability, and presence of intervention are some of the important issues. The age, gender, and risk factors for the disease process in question play roles. In general, age is one of the most important risk factors for cancer. For instance, with breast cancer, an annual mammography is recommended in women older than age 50 years. This imaging technique is widely available, inexpensive, safe, decreases mortality, and is cost-effective.\n\n【33】### WHAT ARE THE RISK FACTORS FOR THIS PROCESS?\n\n【34】Understanding the risk factors helps the practitioner to establish a diagnosis and to determine how to interpret tests. For example, understanding risk-factor analysis may help in the management of a 55-year-old woman with anemia. If the patient has risk factors for endometrial cancer (such as diabetes, hypertension, anovulation) and complains of postmenopausal bleeding, she likely has endometrial carcinoma and should have an endometrial biopsy. Otherwise, occult colonic bleeding is a common etiology. If she takes NSAIDs or aspirin, then peptic ulcer disease is the most likely cause.\n\n【35】CLINICAL PEARL\n\n【36】 Being able to assess risk factors helps to guide testing and develop the differential diagnosis.\n\n【37】### WHAT ARE THE COMPLICATIONS TO THIS PROCESS?\n\n【38】Clinicians must be cognizant of the complications of a disease, so that they will understand how to follow and monitor the patient. Sometimes the student has to make the diagnosis from clinical clues and then apply his/her knowledge of the consequences of the pathologic process. For example, “A 26-year-old male complains of right lower-extremity swelling and pain after a trans-Atlantic flight” and his Doppler ultrasound reveals a deep vein thrombosis. Complications of this process include pulmonary embolism (PE). Understanding the types of consequences also helps the clinician to be aware of the dangers to a patient. If the patient has any symptoms consistent with a PE, a ventilation-perfusion scan or CT scan with angiographic imaging of the chest may be necessary.\n\n【39】### WHAT IS THE BEST THERAPY?\n\n【40】To answer this question, not only does the clinician need to reach the correct diagnosis and assess the severity of the condition, but (s)he must also weigh the situation to determine the appropriate intervention. For the student, knowing exact dosages is not as important as understanding the best medication, route of delivery, mechanism of action, and possible complications. It is important for the student to be able to verbalize the diagnosis and the rationale for the therapy.\n\n【41】CLINICAL PEARL\n\n【42】 Therapy should be logical and based on the severity of disease and the specific diagnosis. An exception to this rule is in an emergent situation, such as respiratory failure or shock, when the patient needs treatment even as the etiology is being investigated.\n\n【43】#### Summary\n\n【44】1\\. There is no replacement for a meticulous history and physical examination.\n\n【45】2\\. There are four steps in the clinical approach to the family medicine patient: making the diagnosis, assessing severity, treating based on severity, and following response.\n\n【46】3\\. There are seven questions that help to bridge the gap between the textbook and the clinical arena.\n删除16：<u>### REFERENCE\n\n【47】Taylor RB, David AK, Fields SA, Phillips DM, Scherger JE.

She was treated with second dose of IVIG 2g/kg/day, total over 12 hours under ECG and BP monitoring at the same time. She started to take oral aspirin and dipyridamole, and meanwhile continued on sulbenicillin sodium plus azithromycin infusion. Mannitol (20%) infusion was given at the dose of 2.5ml/kg. Without consent from her parents, we did not perform bone marrow puncture and lumbar puncture. She received infusion of methylprednisolone 15mg/kg/day for 3 days. This girl was in critical condition and her condition might continue to deteriorate. On Day 12, she developed nausea and vomited undigested food. Body temperature was 38.1°C to 37.2°C. RR 30bpm, SaO <sub>2 </sub> 97%, HR 95bpm, BP was 91/53 mmHg. Her general state was impotent and irritated. She had normal defecate and urine. The rashes disappeared only left pigmentation behind.

LVED was enlarged to 39.1 mm and LVEF was normal . On Day 13, she had vomit once during azithromycin infusion azithromycin infusion and had discomfort at the site of puncture. Her body temperature was down to 37.3°C. She had better appetite and slept. Dry lips were relieved but still with strawberry tongue. Oral mucosa was found with white floccus, and it was difficult to get it out. She had enlarged cervical lymph nodes and hepatosplenomegaly. Her neck was stiff. A neurologist was consulted, and she suggested to perform lumbar puncture test as soon as possible. But patient’s parents refused to give consent again. They only allowed EEG and head MR being performed. Blood test showed normal K <sup>+ </sup> , Na <sup>+ </sup> , Cl <sup>- </sup> , and glucose contents. Chest CT scan showed inflammation on both lungs  with pleural effusion . She received infusion of antibiotics over 10 days and methylprednisolone for 3 days. Then, she had developed thrush. Oral fluconazole was given for antifungal purpose. On the following days, everything got better. She was afebrile. Examination showed the thrush disappeared. There was no tenderness at sternum, and no tapping pain at long bone. Skin peeled off around fingernails. Retested blood work results were shown in Table 5.1 .

She had continuous fever that was unresponsive to broad-spectrum antibiotics, along with 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> strikingly dry lips, strawberry tongue; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> red palms and later skin peeling off around fingernail; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> congestive rashes all over the body; 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> cervical lymphadenectasis, with the largest one over 1.5 cm; 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> bilateral conjunctival congestion without pus secretion. She also met the criteria for IVIG resistance: her fever remained (>38.5°C) after IVIG treatment at 2 g/kg in the first 48 hours, with all aforementioned KD symptoms.\n\n【48】This girl met the criteria of MAS which include 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> continuous high fever; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> hepatosplenomegaly; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> anemia; 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> continuously increased ferritin; 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> increased FDP in DIC; 通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u> macrophage phagocytosis of red blood cells in bone marrow sample; 通用删除7(英):<u>(7)</u> the immature cells seen in routine blood test 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【49】Differential diagnosis of sepsis, acute leukemia, pediatric rheumatic diseases, and acute meningitis should be considered.\n\n【50】### 5.1.5 Case Specific Clinical Features\n\n【51】1.  1.\n\n【52】    Up to now, of the pathogenesis of KD is still unknown. Generally it is accepted it is inflammation resulting in vessel injury. This is similar to JID and therefore it can also induce MAS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. Some literature described quick progression, and multiple organ damages. The fatality rate is very high 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. But, they usually do not have coronary artery lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【53】2.  2.\n\n【54】    The MAS resulted from inflammation. Thus, glucocorticoid is the first choice in treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The dose of glucocorticoid depends on severity of illness. For this girl, 15–30 mg/kg/day was needed and the results demonstrated it was a proper dose. Otherwise, CTX, Cyclosporine A, VP <sub>16 </sub> 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>, and serum replacement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> can be used too.\n\n【55】3.  3.\n\n【56】    This girl had symptoms including abdomen ache and vomiting. Liver function test revealed increased T Bil and D Bil. If without bilateral conjunctival congestion, conjunctiva jaundice maybe found earlier. The jaundice indicated inflammation in liver. Abdomen ultrasound showed her gallbladder wall was rough. Thus, cholecystitis was suspected. Cholecystitis is common in KD . It is one of the symptoms of KD and usually recovered after IVIG and oral aspirin.\n\n【57】4.  4.\n\n【58】    In our center, the most affected system in all the KD complications is digestive system, including stomach, duodenal mucosa, cholecystitis, and hypoalbuminemia. Like in this case, complications include toxicosis hepatitis, cholestatic hepatitis, pancreatitis, and intestinal indigitation involved serous coat of ileocecal junction. Among these complications observed in our center, the top one is liver disease. Usually liver is enlarged after hypoalbuminemia, less than 5 cm under costal margin. In most cases hepatomegaly occurs without spleen enlargement but with possible thickening 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Most cases have even ultrasonic echo in livers. But this girl had hepatomegaly over 8 cm, and echo was enhanced locally. Otherwise, the echo of gallbladder wall was enhanced. Meanwhile the routine blood work showed sustained anemia and increased ferritin. All these together suggested that she had MAS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【59】5.  5.\n\n【60】    This girl had oral thrush. Though we did not test for fungus infection, she received infusion of antibiotics over two weeks and glucocorticoid (high doses for 3 days) over one week. This highly indicated that she had a complication with fungus infection. After treatment with oral fluconazole for three days, the thrush disappeared.

She had continuous fever that was unresponsive to broad-spectrum antibiotics, along with 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> strikingly dry lips, strawberry tongue; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> red palms and later skin peeling off around fingernail; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> congestive rashes all over the body; 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> cervical lymphadenectasis, with the largest one over 1.5 cm; 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> bilateral conjunctival congestion without pus secretion. She also met the criteria for IVIG resistance: her fever remained (>38.5°C) after IVIG treatment at 2 g/kg in the first 48 hours, with all aforementioned KD symptoms.\n\n【48】This girl met the criteria of MAS which include 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> continuous high fever; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> hepatosplenomegaly; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> anemia; 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> continuously increased ferritin; 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> increased FDP in DIC; 通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u> macrophage phagocytosis of red blood cells in bone marrow sample; 通用删除7(英):<u>(7)</u> the immature cells seen in routine blood test 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【49】Differential diagnosis of sepsis, acute leukemia, pediatric rheumatic diseases, and acute meningitis should be considered.\n\n【50】### 5.1.5 Case Specific Clinical Features\n\n【51】1.  1.\n\n【52】    Up to now, of the pathogenesis of KD is still unknown. Generally it is accepted it is inflammation resulting in vessel injury. This is similar to JID and therefore it can also induce MAS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. Some literature described quick progression, and multiple organ damages. The fatality rate is very high 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. But, they usually do not have coronary artery lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【53】2.  2.\n\n【54】    The MAS resulted from inflammation. Thus, glucocorticoid is the first choice in treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The dose of glucocorticoid depends on severity of illness. For this girl, 15–30 mg/kg/day was needed and the results demonstrated it was a proper dose. Otherwise, CTX, Cyclosporine A, VP <sub>16 </sub> 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>, and serum replacement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> can be used too.\n\n【55】3.  3.\n\n【56】    This girl had symptoms including abdomen ache and vomiting. Liver function test revealed increased T Bil and D Bil. If without bilateral conjunctival congestion, conjunctiva jaundice maybe found earlier. The jaundice indicated inflammation in liver. Abdomen ultrasound showed her gallbladder wall was rough. Thus, cholecystitis was suspected. Cholecystitis is common in KD . It is one of the symptoms of KD and usually recovered after IVIG and oral aspirin.\n\n【57】4.  4.\n\n【58】    In our center, the most affected system in all the KD complications is digestive system, including stomach, duodenal mucosa, cholecystitis, and hypoalbuminemia. Like in this case, complications include toxicosis hepatitis, cholestatic hepatitis, pancreatitis, and intestinal indigitation involved serous coat of ileocecal junction. Among these complications observed in our center, the top one is liver disease. Usually liver is enlarged after hypoalbuminemia, less than 5 cm under costal margin. In most cases hepatomegaly occurs without spleen enlargement but with possible thickening 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Most cases have even ultrasonic echo in livers. But this girl had hepatomegaly over 8 cm, and echo was enhanced locally. Otherwise, the echo of gallbladder wall was enhanced. Meanwhile the routine blood work showed sustained anemia and increased ferritin. All these together suggested that she had MAS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【59】5.  5.\n\n【60】    This girl had oral thrush. Though we did not test for fungus infection, she received infusion of antibiotics over two weeks and glucocorticoid (high doses for 3 days) over one week. This highly indicated that she had a complication with fungus infection. After treatment with oral fluconazole for three days, the thrush disappeared. It in turn supported our interpretation.\n\n【61】6.  6.\n\n【62】    Sterility meningitis was also common in KD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. It is usually transient and reversible. Cisterna hydatoncus might be the original changes or result from meningitis. Definite diagnosis depends on follow-up. If they disappeared soon, it suggested meningitis.

A markedly elevated PSA (especiallyvalues > 10 ng/mL) raises suspicion for prostate cancer.  |\n| What is the pathophysiology of this condition? The prostate gland has a central region surrounding the urethra and a peripheral region. In BPH the centralregion hypertrophies in response to stimulation from the growth hormone dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Inprostate cancer， it is often the peripheral region that grows.  |\n| What are the potential complications of this condition? Complications of BPH include the following： · UTI secondary to urine stasis. ●删除17：<u>日</u>Bladder stone formation secondary to urine stasis. ●Daytime sleepiness and exhaustion due to repeated nighttime awakenings from nocturia.· Acute urinary retention， which presents with symptoms such as abdominal pain and a suprapubicmass (the filled bladder).

It is rare for liver enzymes to be elevated or for there to be any hepatic sequelae in the mother； however， every patient who is suspected of having cholestasis of pregnancy should have their liver enzymes checked to avoid fetal morbid-ity and mortality. Hepatic enzyme levels are normally <3 U/L； women with intrahepatic cholestasis may have slightly elevated levels but almost never in the thousands. On presentation， no rash typically accompanies the pruritus. Thrombocytopenia is not involved in this disorder； however， it is involved in a life-threatening condition of pregnancy known as HELLP (hemolysis， elevated liver enzymes， low platelets) syndrome.\n\n【31】14.22D D. PUPPP is not thought to be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. The diagnosis is made presumptively based on clinical presentation， with the rash almost always starting on or near the abdominal striae of the abdomen. They are usually small red\"bumps\"that are intensely pruritic. The treatment is symptom-atic. Interestingly， this condition usually occurs with the first pregnancy and usually does not recur， with the most common onset at 35 to 36 weeks'gestation.\n\n【32】14.3B. Neonatal lesions are sometimes seen with herpes gestationis caused by the IgG antibodies crossing the placenta， and these lesions will resolve. Herpes gestationis is not the same as herpes simplex virus. The latter would necessitate cesarean delivery to avoid infection to the baby.\n\n【33】14.4 4 B. H ypoglycemia is relatively unique to acute fatty liver of pregnancy. Because of the liver insufficiency， glycogen storage is compromised leading to low serum glucose levels， which often require multiple doses of dextrose. Protein-uria is more consistent with preeclampsia， oligohydramnios is nonspecific， and bile acids are more consistent with ICP.\n\n【34】14.5. B. The biophysical profile in this case is 8/10 but with low amniotic fluid volume (oligohydramnios). The oligohydramnios is concerning and is associ-ated with a 20 to 40x increase in fetal death as compared to normal amniotic fluid. Thus， the best management in this setting is induction of labor. Con-traction stress testing or umbilical Doppler flow testing would not add much， or be reassuring. Repeat BPP in 1 week would be appropriate if the BPP were reassuring.\n\n【35】CLINICALPEARLS\n\n【36】》 The most common cause of generalized pruritus in pregnancy in the absence of skin lesions is cholestasis of pregnancy.\n\n【37】(Cholestatic jaundice in pregnancy may be associated with increased adverse pregnancy outcomes.\n\n【38】》The lesions of PUPPP usually begin on the abdomen and spread to the thighs and sometimes the buttocks and arms.\n\n【39】》ICP is associated with adverse fetal outcomes， which PUPPP is not.\n\n【40】》 Acute fatty liver of pregnancy is a rare but serious condition that can lead to fulminant liver failure.

It is rare for liver enzymes to be elevated or for there to be any hepatic sequelae in the mother； however， every patient who is suspected of having cholestasis of pregnancy should have their liver enzymes checked to avoid fetal morbid-ity and mortality. Hepatic enzyme levels are normally <3 U/L； women with intrahepatic cholestasis may have slightly elevated levels but almost never in the thousands.

Additionally, eukaryotic cells possess membrane-bound organelles that further delimit compartments within the cell separated from the surrounding cytoplasm. The distinctive organization of a phospholipid bilayer is a consequence of the amphiphatic nature of individual phospholipid molecules. Polar phospho-head groups can interact with the aqueous environment of the cell while the nonpolar fatty acid tails cluster together, away from water. The two sides or leaflets of a phospholipid bilayer are not equivalent. The outer leaflet or exoplasmic side of the membrane has a high concentration of the phospholipid phosphotidylcholine while the inner or cytosolic side of the membrane is enriched in the phospholipids phosphotidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine. Another important feature of biological membranes is the presence of membrane proteins. Integral membrane proteins inserted into the bilayer can only be removed using harsh methods such as detergents while peripheral membrane proteins associate with the phospho-head groups and can be removed using buffers containing high concentrations of salt.\n\n【4】▪ Name some of the different membranes and the compartments they create in a eukaryotic cell.\n\n【5】▪ Define the term “amphipathic” using your own words.\n\n【6】▪ Create a diagram of a biological membrane that illustrates the asymmetry of the different types of lipids on the two sides of the bilayer.

Biopsy shows a whorled pattern of smooth muscle. A gross specimen from a patient with similar pathology is shown below. These masses are most commonly associated with which of the following conditions?\n删除个例：<u>> Reproduced, with permission, from USMLERx.com.</u>\n> (A) Enlargement during pregnancy\n\n【1】> (B) Formation of chocolate cysts\n\n【2】> (C) Malignant transformation\n\n【3】> (D) Pelvic inflammatory disease\n\n【4】> (E) Postmenopausal metastasis\n\n【5】 Answer: The correct answer is A. Leiomyomas, or fibroids, are common smooth muscle tumors that are most often seen in African-American women and present with multiple masses. These tumors are benign and can be associated with dysmenorrhea (menstrual pain), menorrhagia/menometrorrhagia (heavy prolonged bleeding), infertility, and abnormal pelvic exams including palpable masses extending from the uterus. Because they are estrogen sensitive, they tend to increase in size during menses or pregnancy and decrease in size after menopause. Treatment of fibroids is solely dependent on the severity of symptoms and the desire of the woman to preserve or not preserve fertility. Myomectomy can be performed in a woman wishing to preserve fertility, whereas hysterectomy is used in women with severe symptoms not wishing to preserve fertility. Medical therapy can be tried with monotherapy or combinations of GnRH analogs (leuprolide), combined oral contraceptives, progestins, and/or GnRH antagonists (centrorelix).  \n\n【6】Answer B is incorrect. Chocolate cysts and “powder burns” are most often associated with endometriosis (nonneoplastic ectopic endometrial tissue outside the uterus). Endometriosis is often associated with severe menstrual-related pain and infertility, but this patient’s masses are confined to the uterus, and the biopsy shows smooth muscle proliferation rather than the glandular and stromal proliferation at ectopic sites that would be expected with endometriosis.  \n\n【7】Answer C is incorrect. Leiomyomas are benign tumors that are very rarely associated with malignant transformation. Malignant leiomyosarcomas most typically arise de novo with areas of necrosis and hemorrhage, not from leiomyomas.  \n\n【8】Answer D is incorrect. Leiomyomas are not the cause of PID, but rather occur independently of the development of PID. PID is the end result of a polymicrobial infection of the genital tract, most commonly caused by untreated Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis . PID commonly presents with odiferous vaginal discharge, pain with sexual intercourse, urinary symptoms, and dysmenorrhea as well as a history of multiple unprotected sexual encounters. However, PID can also be asymptomatic. Treatment of PID is aimed at treating the most likely microbial pathogen(s). PID does not cause proliferation of the smooth muscle cells leading to benign tumors.  \n\n【9】Answer E is incorrect. Leiomyomas, or fibroids, are estrogen-sensitive benign tumors and thus frequently regress in size after menopause. Also, they are not malignant nor do they metastasize. A metastatic mass in a post-menopausal woman should warrant further evaluation of a neoplastic process, and should lessen the suspicion of uterine fibroids.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 13:58:50", "endTime": "2024/09/12 13:59:02", "cost": 11.916}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:27", "update_time": "2024-09-11 21:59:01", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 21:58:49"}

Horizontal nystagmus, pulmonary râles, and edematous lower extremities are noted on physical examination. On questioning, the patient states that he started drinking alcohol when he was a prisoner of war in Vietnam. His current alcohol level is within the legal limit, a toxicology screen is negative, and a stroke has been ruled out by imaging. Which of the following additional tests should be performed to estimate the extent of his disease?\n\n【1】> (A) A lumbar puncture\n\n【2】> (B) A transesophageal echocardiogram\n\n【3】> (C) Coagulation studies\n\n【4】> (D) Tissue pressure in the lower extremities\n\n【5】> (E) Venous Doppler ultrasound imaging of the lower extremities\n\n【6】 Answer: The correct answer is B . This patient suffers from Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. Alcoholic patients often have reduced intake of calories other than from alcohol and become deficient in various nutrients, among them vitamin B1 (thiamine). Thiamine is a needed cofactor in some of the key reactions in the Krebs cycle. Without it, cells are in a low-energy state that will eventually damage those cells with high-energy requirements (neurons and myocardium). Wernicke encephalopathy is an acute syndrome that is reversible with thiamine administration; it is characterized by mental status changes (disorientation, confusion, inattention), ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and nystagmus. Korsakoff dementia is a chronic syndrome and is irreversible; it is characterized by symptoms of Wernicke encephalopathy, selective anterograde and retrograde amnesia, and confabulations (note that the patient is too young to have been in World War II). Additionally, peripheral neuropathy (dry beriberi) or dilated cardiomyopathy (wet beriberi) may develop, as in this patient. A transesophageal echocardiogram allows for assessment of the extent of the cardiomyopathy.  \n\n【7】Answer A is incorrect . Lumbar puncture may be helpful in the case of meningitis. However, nothing in the patient’s history points to meningitis (headache, stiff neck). Imaging is needed to assess the extent of cerebral atrophy.  \n\n【8】Answer C is incorrect . Coagulation studies will most likely reveal prolonged times in this patient (ie, the patient is anticoagulated). This is commonly seen in patients with damaged livers. Although coagulation studies allow appreciation of the amount of liver dysfunction, they do not measure the extent of the patient’s primary problem, which is the nutritional deficit of thiamine and its associated consequences.  \n\n【9】Answer D is incorrect . Tissue pressures are a measure of the severity of compartment syndrome. Although compartment syndrome presents with edematous tissues, it is not associated with neurologic symptoms such as confusion and confabulation. Furthermore, the question stem does not describe any possible historical clues for compartment syndrome to develop (such as recent trauma).  \n\n【10】Answer E is incorrect . Venous Doppler ultrasonography is used to diagnose deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Although a patient’s legs may become edematous and pulmonary râles (in the case of embolization to the lung) may develop, DVT does not explain the neurologic status of this patient. The patient is too old for an inherited clotting disorder to appear (usually occurs before age 40), and no predisposing factors are listed in the question stem (eg, recent surgery, cancer, oral contraceptives). In fact, many alcoholics are somewhat anticoagulated, as a damaged liver produces fewer clotting factors.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 13:47:48", "endTime": "2024/09/12 13:48:07", "cost": 18.631}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:27", "update_time": "2024-09-11 21:48:07", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 21:47:49"}

A lung with increased elastic recoil (decreased compliance) will be harder to fill on inspiration and will tend to pull the chest wall inward on relaxation of the muscles of breathing. Thus， both TLC and FRC will be decreased. Because airway radius is normal or even increased， FEV，normalized to FVC will be normal or increased even though FVC will be reduced. Decreased muscle strength could cause a decrease in TLC， but it would not alter FRC.\n\n【20】\\[15.2\\] B. If the muscles of inspiration are weak， lungs cannot be inflated as well， thus reducing the inspiratory reserve volume and TLC. If the muscles of expiration are weak， not as much air can be forced from the lungs and expiratory reserve volume will be decreased， thus increasing RV. Increases in elastic recoil of either the chest wall or the lungs and increases in airway resistance will alter TLC and/or FRC.\n\n【21】\\[15.3\\] C. As a result of the decrease in myocardial contractility， end dias-tolic pressure in the left ventricle increases， leading to an increase in the pulmonaryvenousandpulmonarycapillarypressures. The increased pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressure leads to increased pulmonary capillary filtration， and when filtration exceeds lymph flow， pulmonary edema develops. Pulmonary artery pressure is likely to be increased in this condition. The edema interferes with gas exchange and with lung inflation； thus， arterial oxygen partial pres-sure and vital capacity will be decreased.\n\n【22】PHYSIOLOGY PEARLS\n\n【23】Changes in FRC point toward changes in lung and chest wall struc-ture such as those caused by pulmonary fibrosis.\n\n【24】Decreases in forced airflow， especially normalized to FVC， point toward increased airway resistance such as that seen in asthma， bronchitis， and emphysema.\n\n【25】Pulmonary edema results in a ventilation-perfusion inequality and a decrease in diffusion of oxygen， leading to a decrease in oxygen transfer and arterial oxygen partial pressure.\n\n【26】In a normal person who is standing or sitting upright， both blood flow and alveolar ventilation are lowest at the top of the lung and greatest near the bottom of the lung.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 14:29:27", "endTime": "2024/09/12 14:29:40", "cost": 13.067}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:27", "update_time": "2024-09-11 22:29:39", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 22:29:26"}

It is mostly located in the forearm, but sometimes it  删除换行 radiates to the upper arm. The pain is characteristic of  删除换行 intermittent claudication i.e. pain appears with the use  删除换行 of the arm particularly when the arm is in a raised position  删除换行 at the time of exercise. The pain is relieved by rest. This  删除换行 pain is of ischaemic muscle.\n\n【11】(ii) The hand of the affected side is colder and paler  删除换行 than its fellow of the opposite side. Sometimes the hand  删除换行 and the fingers may become cyanosed when it is depen删除8：<u>￾</u>dent for long.\n\n【12】(iii) Numbness of the fingers is a very common  删除换行 complaint. In a long continued case there may be  删除换行 ulceration or even gangrene of the fingers.\n\n【13】(iv) Radial pulse is sometimes as full as that of the  删除换行 other side. But if Adson’s test is performed or the arm is  删除换行 hyperabducted, the radial pulse may become feeble or  删除换行 even absent on the affected side.\n\n【14】Sometimes a systolic bruit can be heard over the dis删除8：<u>￾</u>tal part of the subclavian artery.\n\n【15】IV. CERVICAL RIB WITH NEUROLOGICAL\n\n【16】SYMPTOMS.— Neurological symptoms from cervical rib  删除换行 is not that common. Usually the lower trunk of the  删除换行 brachial plexus i.e. C8 and Tl segments are affected.\n\n【17】(i). Sensory disturbances may be detected along the  删除换行 medial aspect of the forearm, the hand, the little finger  删除换行 and the medial aspect of the ring finger. Fine sensation  删除换行 may be lost. One must test crude sensation, temperature  删除换行 sensation, vibration sensation in these parts.\n\n【18】(ii) Motor disturbances are also distributed along C8  删除换行 and Tl. The muscles of the hypothenar eminence and  删除换行 other small muscles of the hand supplied by the ulnar 删除换行 subclavian artery.\n\n【19】nerve are usually affected. Weakness and in late cases  删除换行 wasting may be noticed.\n\n【20】Again it is emphasised that neurological symptoms  删除换行 are less common in cervical rib than vascular symptoms. \n\n【21】When a case is presented mainly with neurological  删除换行 symptoms alongwith presence of cervical rib, one must  删除换行 exclude (i) pressure on the cervical roots in the region of  删除换行 the intervertebral foramina, (ii) protrusion of intervertebral  删除换行 cervical disc, (iii) Carpal-Tunnel syndrome or (iv)  删除换行 angulation of the ulnar nerve behind the elbow, before  删除换行 one comes to the conclusion that the neurological  删除换行 symptoms are due to the cervical rib only.\n\n【22】PHYSICAL EXAMINATION.—\n\n【23】1. No symptom — no treatment.\n\n【24】2. CONSERVATIVE TREATMENT. — This is 删除换行 indicated in all cases as the first mode of treatment. This  删除换行 is primarily aimed at strengthening the muscles of the  删除换行 shoulder girdle. Majority of the symptoms are due to  删除换行 sagging down or drooping of the shoulder.\n\n【25】Conservative treatment includes —\n\n【26】(i) Use of a sling.\n\n【27】(ii) Physiotherapy and exercises to strengthen the  删除换行 muscles of the shoulder girdle and to elevate the shoulder.\n\n【28】(iii) Certain analgesics.\n\n【29】(iv) The patient is instructed not to carry heavy  删除换行 weight like a bucket full of water, a heavy shopping basket  删除换行 etc.\n\n【30】About 80% of cases are relieved of symptoms by this  删除换行 simple conservative management.\n\n【31】5. OPERATIVE TREATMENT Operation is  删除换行 advised —RAYNAUD’S SYNDROME, BUERGER’S DISEASE, THORACIC OUTLET SYNDROME AND CERVICAL RIB 169\n\n【32】(a) When conservative treatment fails.\n\n【33】(b) When there is vascular symptom.\n\n【34】(c) When there is neurological symptom.\n\n【35】THORACIC OUTLET SYNDROME\n\n【36】A.When Cervical Rib Is Present — extraperiosteal  删除换行 excision of the cervical rib together with any bony  删除换行 prominence of the first rib is performed. The whole of  删除换行 the cervical rib must be excised alongwith its fibrous band  删除换行 if present. Sometimes first rib is also excised when it is  删除换行 noticed that it is compressing the subclavian artery or  删除换行 the postfixed brachial plexus. The periosteum of the rib  删除换行 should also be excised, so that there is no chance of  删除换行 regeneration of the rib.\n\n【37】One should also perform scalenotomy i.e. scalenus an删除8：<u>￾</u>ticus muscle is divided close to its insertion.\n\n【38】Excision of the cervical rib.— One of the three  删除换行 approaches may be adopted for excision of the cervical  删除换行 rib. Anterior approach is by far the most popular.\n\n【39】(a) ANTERIOR APPROACH.— A sand bag is placed  删除换行 between the patient’s shoulders to extend the neck and  删除换行 the arm of the affected side is drawn downwards  删除换行 strongly.The incision is made 1 inch above the clavicle  删除换行 and extends laterally from the clavicular attachment of  删除换行 the sternomastoid to the anterior border of the trapezius  删除换行 muscle. The lateral border of the sternomastoid is  删除换行 retracted medially. The phrenic nerve will be seen  删除换行 coursing downwards on the surface of the scalenus anterior  删除换行 muscle.The phrenic nerve is protected and the scalenus  删除换行 anterior muscle is divided at its insertion to the first rib  删除换行 or the cervical rib. The knife edge is kept against the  删除换行 bone, so that the subclavian artery and the thyrocervical  删除换行 trunk are not injured.The trunks of the brachial plexus  删除换行 are identified. The plexus is then gently retracted  删除换行 downwards and forwards. The scalenus medius muscle is  删除换行 identified and the fibres of this muscle inserted into the  删除换行 cervical rib are divided from it. The cervical rib is now  删除换行 cleared of all attachments and the pleura must be safe删除8：<u>￾</u>guarded. The cervical rib is then disarticulated from the  删除换行 transverse process of the 7th cervical vertebra or is divided  删除换行 as far posteriorly as possible and thus the cervical rib is  删除换行 removed. The periosteum is never lifted off the cervical  删除换行 rib and it is excised along with the rib.\n\n【40】(b) TRANSAXILLARY APPROACH.— The incision is  删除换行 made in the lower most portion of the axilla from the  删除换行 pectoralis major anteriorly to the latissimus dorsi  删除换行 posteriorly. The incision is deepened to the muscles of  删除换行 the chest wall. The serratus anterior and the intercostal  删除换行 muscles are now exposed. The intercostobrachial nerve is  删除换行 saved. Dissection is continued upward and just above  删除换行 the first rib one can see scalene muscles which are inserted  删除换行 to the first rib.The scalene muscles are transected. The  删除换行 cervical rib is identified. Any attachment to the cervical  删除换行 rib is divided and the cervical rib is removed in its entirety  删除换行 including the periosteum. If required the first rib is also  删除换行 removed from the costochondral junction anteriorly to  删除换行 the posterior angle of the rib posteriorly. The parietal  删除换行 pleura usually lies deep to the dissection. In case the  删除换行 pleura is punctured, the puncture is closed around a  删除换行 catheter whilst the anaesthetist expands the lungs.\n\n【41】(c) POSTERIOR APPROACH.— The incision is  删除换行 identical to that used for an upper thoracoplasty. The  删除换行 subclavian vessels and the brachial plexus are easily  删除换行 exposed and are displaced anteriorly. Cervical rib may be  删除换行 excised through this approach and this provides ample  删除换行 exposure for reconstruction of the vessels if required.\n\n【42】Scalenotomy.—\n\n【43】Division of scalenus anterior muscle alone may be  删除换行 successful in relieving symptoms by allowing the  删除换行 subclavian artery and brachial plexus to slide forward to  删除换行 a lower level on the first rib. The position and incision are  删除换行 similar to those applied for excision of the cervical rib. \n\n【44】The scalenus anterior muscle is exposed. The phrenic  删除换行 nerve is protected and the insertion of the scalenus anterior  删除换行 is divided from the first rib. The subclavian artery and  删除换行 the lower trunk of the brachial plexus should be examined  删除换行 carefully whether they are really relieved of any stretching  删除换行 or compression. If the nerve trunks appear to be stretched  删除换行 over the medial tendinous fibres of the scalenus medius,  删除换行 these fibres should also be divided.\n\n【45】B. When There Is No Cervical Rib — only  删除换行 scalenotomy is performed. A thorough search should be  删除换行 made for presence of a fibrous band in the substance of  删除换行 the scalenus medius muscle or neighbourhood. If this be  删除换行 present, it must be excised.CHAPTER\n\n【46】CLINICAL FEATURES.—\nTHE BREAST 13\n\n【47】TREATMENT.—\nThe most common benign tumour of the female breast  删除换行 is the fibroadenoma. It is a new growth composed of both  删除换行 fibrous and glandular tissues.\n\n【48】Aetiology.— This tumour is said to develop as the  删除换行 result of increased sensitivity of a focal area of breast to  删除换行 oestrogen. It is almost an acceptable fact that there is  删除换行 some relationship between excess oestrogen level and fi删除8：<u>￾</u>broadenoma. That is why this condition may present si删除8：<u>￾</u>multaneously with fibroadenosis or ANDI.\n\n【49】Pathology.— These lesions are encapsulated and tend  删除换行 to be spherical but on occasions they may be  删除换行 multinodular or somewhat irregular.\n\n【50】On section these lesions are composed of uniform,  删除换行 greyish white, fleshy, homogeneous mass with fibrous  删除换行 whorls surrounded by the capsule. There may be some  删除换行 minute yellow to pink softer areas. Fibroadenoma is  删除换行 classified into two varieties according to their origin — \n\n【51】either Pericanalicular or Intracanalicular.\n\n【52】The breast has two components of connective tissue  删除换行 separated by the elastic lamina which covers the ductules. \n\n【53】When the connective tissue outside this elastic lamina  删除换行 becomes proliferated along with the glandular element it  删除换行 is called pericanalicular fibroadenoma. When the  删除换行 connective tissue inside the elastic lamina becomes  删除换行 proliferated alongwith the glandular element, it is called  删除换行 intracanalicular fibroadenoma.\n\n【54】The (Hard 删除换行 fibroadenoma) is firmer, smaller with an increase in ducts  删除换行 and fibrous stroma. This tumour can be felt very clearly  删除换行 out of the breast tissue due to its tremendous firmness  删除换行 and it moves sufficiently within the breast substance, so  删除换行 it is often called ‘breast mouse’. In this type round or  删除换行 oval gland spaces are present lined by single or multiple  删除换行 layers of cells.\n\n【55】The (soft 删除换行 fibroadenoma) is relatively less firm, grows larger and the  删除换行 glandular tissue and the duct system are very much  删除换行 compressed with great distortion due to proliferated  删除换行 surrounding connective tissue pressing on them. \n\n【56】Connective tissue is so profuse and rather loose that this 删除换行 type is often referred to as intraductal myxoma. It must  删除换行 be remembered that both pericanalicular and  删除换行 intracanalicular patterns may coexist within the same  删除换行 tumour.\n\n【57】Clinical features.—\n\n【58】CERVICAL RIB AND SCALENUS\n\n【59】ANTICUS SYNDROME\n\n【60】(i) The pericanalicular or hard type usually occurs  删除换行 in younger girls between 15 and 30 years of age. \n\n【61】Intracanalicular or soft fibroadenoma more commonly  删除换行 affects older group from 30 to 50 years of age.\n\n【62】(ii) This tumour is most commonly presented as a  删除换行 painless, slowly growing, solitary lump in the breast. \n\n【63】While this tumour is often seen in the lower part of the  删除换行 breast, fibroadenosis or ANDI occurs mostly in the upper  删除换行 and outer quadrant of the breast.\n\n【64】(iii) Multiple fibroadenomata may be present in  删除换行 about 10% of cases.\n\n【65】(iv) Pain is usually conspicuous by its absence,  删除换行 though it may be occasionally complained of, particularly  删除换行 when there is associated fibroadenosis.\n\n【66】(v) Though the hard variety is known for its slow  删除换行 growth and never attains a big size, yet intracanalicular  删除换行 fibroadenoma tends to be large in size due to rapid growth. \n\n【67】Some discomfort or slight pain may be complained of  删除换行 due to its size rather than anything else.\n\n【68】(vi) Discharge through the nipple is almost  删除换行 unknown.\n\n【69】CLINICAL FEATURES.—\n\n【70】INSPECTION does not reveal anything particular and  删除换行 the nipple remains always normal. But in case of large  删除换行 intracanalicular fibroadenoma, swelling may be visible.\n\n【71】PALPATION is important, (a) A freely mobile solitary  删除换行 lump within the breast with a round smooth margin is  删除换行 nothing but a fibroadenoma. The consistency is firm  删除换行 except in case of large intracanalicular variety when  删除换行 consistency may be softer.\n\n【72】(b) The lump is neither fixed to the overlying skin,  删除换行 nor fixed to the fascia covering pectoralis major. It is also  删除换行 not fixed within the breast and is so freely movable, that  删除换行 it is often called a ‘breast mouse’.\n\n【73】(c) The axillary lymph nodes are usually not enlarged.\n\n【74】Treatment.— Excisional biopsy is the treatment ofCERTAIN DISORDERS OF THE BREAST 171 删除换行 choice. Although a skilled clinician can probably detect  删除换行 a fibroadenoma with an accuracy of 80% to 85%, yet  删除换行 excision is mandatory. This gives an opportunity to get  删除换行 the histopathological report. Moreover removal of the  删除换行 tumour will give the patient a psychological advantage  删除换行 to have been cured from the disease. Periareolar or  删除换行 submammary incision should be attempted at whenever  删除换行 possible. As the tumour is often situated in the lower  删除换行 part of the breast submammary incision (Gaillard Thomas’  删除换行 incision) is often applied. Only when the tumour cannot  删除换行 be removed through one of these incisions, a radical 删除换行 incision or a curved incision along the line of Langer is  删除换行 made. The incision is deepened right upto the capsule of  删除换行 the tumour. In case of pericanalicular variety the capsule  删除换行 is incised and the tumour is removed with a finger which  删除换行 is pushed into the cleavage between the capsule and the  删除换行 tumour, the adhesions are severed and the tumour is  删除换行 brought out of the incision. This is called enucleation. \n\n【75】In case of intracanalicular variety enucleation may not be  删除换行 possible and the whole tumour is excised. The dead space  删除换行 is obliterated with catgut suturing. Haemostasis is  删除换行 attained. The skin is closed. Drainage is only necessary  删除换行 when one is not very sure of haemostasis and when there  删除换行 is a big dead space.\n\n【76】The excised tumour is sent for frozen section biopsy. \n\n【77】Only when unfortunately carcinoma is detected, radical 删除换行 mastectomy should be performed.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【8】Fjq 12 1 —Shows four common types of cervical rib.

Usually the lower trunk of the  删除换行 brachial plexus i.e. C8 and Tl segments are affected.\n\n【17】(i). Sensory disturbances may be detected along the  删除换行 medial aspect of the forearm, the hand, the little finger  删除换行 and the medial aspect of the ring finger. Fine sensation  删除换行 may be lost. One must test crude sensation, temperature  删除换行 sensation, vibration sensation in these parts.\n\n【18】(ii) Motor disturbances are also distributed along C8  删除换行 and Tl. The muscles of the hypothenar eminence and  删除换行 other small muscles of the hand supplied by the ulnar 删除换行 subclavian artery.\n\n【19】nerve are usually affected. Weakness and in late cases  删除换行 wasting may be noticed.\n\n【20】Again it is emphasised that neurological symptoms  删除换行 are less common in cervical rib than vascular symptoms. \n\n【21】When a case is presented mainly with neurological  删除换行 symptoms alongwith presence of cervical rib, one must  删除换行 exclude (i) pressure on the cervical roots in the region of  删除换行 the intervertebral foramina, (ii) protrusion of intervertebral  删除换行 cervical disc, (iii) Carpal-Tunnel syndrome or (iv)  删除换行 angulation of the ulnar nerve behind the elbow, before  删除换行 one comes to the conclusion that the neurological  删除换行 symptoms are due to the cervical rib only.\n\n【22】PHYSICAL EXAMINATION.—\n\n【23】1. No symptom — no treatment.\n\n【24】2. CONSERVATIVE TREATMENT. — This is 删除换行 indicated in all cases as the first mode of treatment. This  删除换行 is primarily aimed at strengthening the muscles of the  删除换行 shoulder girdle. Majority of the symptoms are due to  删除换行 sagging down or drooping of the shoulder.\n\n【25】Conservative treatment includes —\n\n【26】(i) Use of a sling.\n\n【27】(ii) Physiotherapy and exercises to strengthen the  删除换行 muscles of the shoulder girdle and to elevate the shoulder.\n\n【28】(iii) Certain analgesics.\n\n【29】(iv) The patient is instructed not to carry heavy  删除换行 weight like a bucket full of water, a heavy shopping basket  删除换行 etc.\n\n【30】About 80% of cases are relieved of symptoms by this  删除换行 simple conservative management.\n\n【31】5. OPERATIVE TREATMENT Operation is  删除换行 advised —RAYNAUD’S SYNDROME, BUERGER’S DISEASE, THORACIC OUTLET SYNDROME AND CERVICAL RIB 169\n\n【32】(a) When conservative treatment fails.\n\n【33】(b) When there is vascular symptom.\n\n【34】(c) When there is neurological symptom.\n\n【35】THORACIC OUTLET SYNDROME\n\n【36】A.When Cervical Rib Is Present — extraperiosteal  删除换行 excision of the cervical rib together with any bony  删除换行 prominence of the first rib is performed. The whole of  删除换行 the cervical rib must be excised alongwith its fibrous band  删除换行 if present. Sometimes first rib is also excised when it is  删除换行 noticed that it is compressing the subclavian artery or  删除换行 the postfixed brachial plexus. The periosteum of the rib  删除换行 should also be excised, so that there is no chance of  删除换行 regeneration of the rib.\n\n【37】One should also perform scalenotomy i.e. scalenus an删除8：<u>￾</u>ticus muscle is divided close to its insertion.\n\n【38】Excision of the cervical rib.— One of the three  删除换行 approaches may be adopted for excision of the cervical  删除换行 rib. Anterior approach is by far the most popular.\n\n【39】(a) ANTERIOR APPROACH.— A sand bag is placed  删除换行 between the patient’s shoulders to extend the neck and  删除换行 the arm of the affected side is drawn downwards  删除换行 strongly.The incision is made 1 inch above the clavicle  删除换行 and extends laterally from the clavicular attachment of  删除换行 the sternomastoid to the anterior border of the trapezius  删除换行 muscle. The lateral border of the sternomastoid is  删除换行 retracted medially. The phrenic nerve will be seen  删除换行 coursing downwards on the surface of the scalenus anterior  删除换行 muscle.The phrenic nerve is protected and the scalenus  删除换行 anterior muscle is divided at its insertion to the first rib  删除换行 or the cervical rib. The knife edge is kept against the  删除换行 bone, so that the subclavian artery and the thyrocervical  删除换行 trunk are not injured.The trunks of the brachial plexus  删除换行 are identified. The plexus is then gently retracted  删除换行 downwards and forwards. The scalenus medius muscle is  删除换行 identified and the fibres of this muscle inserted into the  删除换行 cervical rib are divided from it. The cervical rib is now  删除换行 cleared of all attachments and the pleura must be safe删除8：<u>￾</u>guarded. The cervical rib is then disarticulated from the  删除换行 transverse process of the 7th cervical vertebra or is divided  删除换行 as far posteriorly as possible and thus the cervical rib is  删除换行 removed. The periosteum is never lifted off the cervical  删除换行 rib and it is excised along with the rib.\n\n【40】(b) TRANSAXILLARY APPROACH.— The incision is  删除换行 made in the lower most portion of the axilla from the  删除换行 pectoralis major anteriorly to the latissimus dorsi  删除换行 posteriorly. The incision is deepened to the muscles of  删除换行 the chest wall. The serratus anterior and the intercostal  删除换行 muscles are now exposed. The intercostobrachial nerve is  删除换行 saved. Dissection is continued upward and just above  删除换行 the first rib one can see scalene muscles which are inserted  删除换行 to the first rib.The scalene muscles are transected. The  删除换行 cervical rib is identified. Any attachment to the cervical  删除换行 rib is divided and the cervical rib is removed in its entirety  删除换行 including the periosteum. If required the first rib is also  删除换行 removed from the costochondral junction anteriorly to  删除换行 the posterior angle of the rib posteriorly. The parietal  删除换行 pleura usually lies deep to the dissection. In case the  删除换行 pleura is punctured, the puncture is closed around a  删除换行 catheter whilst the anaesthetist expands the lungs.\n\n【41】(c) POSTERIOR APPROACH.— The incision is  删除换行 identical to that used for an upper thoracoplasty. The  删除换行 subclavian vessels and the brachial plexus are easily  删除换行 exposed and are displaced anteriorly. Cervical rib may be  删除换行 excised through this approach and this provides ample  删除换行 exposure for reconstruction of the vessels if required.\n\n【42】Scalenotomy.—\n\n【43】Division of scalenus anterior muscle alone may be  删除换行 successful in relieving symptoms by allowing the  删除换行 subclavian artery and brachial plexus to slide forward to  删除换行 a lower level on the first rib. The position and incision are  删除换行 similar to those applied for excision of the cervical rib. \n\n【44】The scalenus anterior muscle is exposed. The phrenic  删除换行 nerve is protected and the insertion of the scalenus anterior  删除换行 is divided from the first rib. The subclavian artery and  删除换行 the lower trunk of the brachial plexus should be examined  删除换行 carefully whether they are really relieved of any stretching  删除换行 or compression. If the nerve trunks appear to be stretched  删除换行 over the medial tendinous fibres of the scalenus medius,  删除换行 these fibres should also be divided.\n\n【45】B. When There Is No Cervical Rib — only  删除换行 scalenotomy is performed. A thorough search should be  删除换行 made for presence of a fibrous band in the substance of  删除换行 the scalenus medius muscle or neighbourhood. If this be  删除换行 present, it must be excised.CHAPTER\n\n【46】CLINICAL FEATURES.—\nTHE BREAST 13\n\n【47】TREATMENT.—\nThe most common benign tumour of the female breast  删除换行 is the fibroadenoma. It is a new growth composed of both  删除换行 fibrous and glandular tissues.\n\n【48】Aetiology.— This tumour is said to develop as the  删除换行 result of increased sensitivity of a focal area of breast to  删除换行 oestrogen. It is almost an acceptable fact that there is  删除换行 some relationship between excess oestrogen level and fi删除8：<u>￾</u>broadenoma. That is why this condition may present si删除8：<u>￾</u>multaneously with fibroadenosis or ANDI.\n\n【49】Pathology.— These lesions are encapsulated and tend  删除换行 to be spherical but on occasions they may be  删除换行 multinodular or somewhat irregular.\n\n【50】On section these lesions are composed of uniform,  删除换行 greyish white, fleshy, homogeneous mass with fibrous  删除换行 whorls surrounded by the capsule. There may be some  删除换行 minute yellow to pink softer areas. Fibroadenoma is  删除换行 classified into two varieties according to their origin — \n\n【51】either Pericanalicular or Intracanalicular.\n\n【52】The breast has two components of connective tissue  删除换行 separated by the elastic lamina which covers the ductules. \n\n【53】When the connective tissue outside this elastic lamina  删除换行 becomes proliferated along with the glandular element it  删除换行 is called pericanalicular fibroadenoma. When the  删除换行 connective tissue inside the elastic lamina becomes  删除换行 proliferated alongwith the glandular element, it is called  删除换行 intracanalicular fibroadenoma.\n\n【54】The (Hard 删除换行 fibroadenoma) is firmer, smaller with an increase in ducts  删除换行 and fibrous stroma. This tumour can be felt very clearly  删除换行 out of the breast tissue due to its tremendous firmness  删除换行 and it moves sufficiently within the breast substance, so  删除换行 it is often called ‘breast mouse’. In this type round or  删除换行 oval gland spaces are present lined by single or multiple  删除换行 layers of cells.\n\n【55】The (soft 删除换行 fibroadenoma) is relatively less firm, grows larger and the  删除换行 glandular tissue and the duct system are very much  删除换行 compressed with great distortion due to proliferated  删除换行 surrounding connective tissue pressing on them. \n\n【56】Connective tissue is so profuse and rather loose that this 删除换行 type is often referred to as intraductal myxoma. It must  删除换行 be remembered that both pericanalicular and  删除换行 intracanalicular patterns may coexist within the same  删除换行 tumour.\n\n【57】Clinical features.—\n\n【58】CERVICAL RIB AND SCALENUS\n\n【59】ANTICUS SYNDROME\n\n【60】(i) The pericanalicular or hard type usually occurs  删除换行 in younger girls between 15 and 30 years of age. \n\n【61】Intracanalicular or soft fibroadenoma more commonly  删除换行 affects older group from 30 to 50 years of age.\n\n【62】(ii) This tumour is most commonly presented as a  删除换行 painless, slowly growing, solitary lump in the breast. \n\n【63】While this tumour is often seen in the lower part of the  删除换行 breast, fibroadenosis or ANDI occurs mostly in the upper  删除换行 and outer quadrant of the breast.\n\n【64】(iii) Multiple fibroadenomata may be present in  删除换行 about 10% of cases.\n\n【65】(iv) Pain is usually conspicuous by its absence,  删除换行 though it may be occasionally complained of, particularly  删除换行 when there is associated fibroadenosis.\n\n【66】(v) Though the hard variety is known for its slow  删除换行 growth and never attains a big size, yet intracanalicular  删除换行 fibroadenoma tends to be large in size due to rapid growth. \n\n【67】Some discomfort or slight pain may be complained of  删除换行 due to its size rather than anything else.\n\n【68】(vi) Discharge through the nipple is almost  删除换行 unknown.\n\n【69】CLINICAL FEATURES.—\n\n【70】INSPECTION does not reveal anything particular and  删除换行 the nipple remains always normal. But in case of large  删除换行 intracanalicular fibroadenoma, swelling may be visible.\n\n【71】PALPATION is important, (a) A freely mobile solitary  删除换行 lump within the breast with a round smooth margin is  删除换行 nothing but a fibroadenoma. The consistency is firm  删除换行 except in case of large intracanalicular variety when  删除换行 consistency may be softer.\n\n【72】(b) The lump is neither fixed to the overlying skin,  删除换行 nor fixed to the fascia covering pectoralis major. It is also  删除换行 not fixed within the breast and is so freely movable, that  删除换行 it is often called a ‘breast mouse’.\n\n【73】(c) The axillary lymph nodes are usually not enlarged.\n\n【74】Treatment.— Excisional biopsy is the treatment ofCERTAIN DISORDERS OF THE BREAST 171 删除换行 choice.

The liver appears of normal  删除换行 echogenicity and echo texture with a smooth capsular contour. No focal lesion is seen on  删除换行 this image. There are anechoic linear structures seen which extend to the periphery with  删除换行 a maximal diameter of 4 mm, and colour Doppler assessment in Figure 14.2 demonstrates  删除换行 no flow within them. This is in keeping with intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation, and the  删除换行 remainder of the study did not demonstrate an obstructing lesion although the common  删除换行 bile duct (CBD) was 7 mm in diameter, which is within normal limits for a patient post  删除换行 cholecystectomy. The patient was referred for a liver magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)  删除换行 scan for further characterization. The liver function tests of raised bilirubin and alkaline  删除换行 phosphatase with normal transaminases and albumin suggest obstruction with normal  删除换行 cellular and synthetic function.</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 14.3 is a coronal maximal intensity projection (MIP) image of the same patient  删除换行 acquired from heavily T2-weighted sequences. It confirms moderate intrahepatic biliary  删除换行 duct dilatation and also demonstrates a focal tapered stenosis at the level of the common  删除换行 hepatic duct. There is no intraductal filling defect or stenosing soft tissue mass lesion, and  删除换行 the CBD and pancreatic duct are of normal calibre. The appearances suggest a stricture  删除换行 of the common hepatic duct which may be ischaemic, post inflammatory or neoplastic in  删除换行 nature. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was advised to obtain  删除换行 cytology brushings, attempt to correct the obstruction and decompress the intrahepatic  删除换行 ducts, but a stent could not be inserted. The patient was therefore referred to the inter删除8：<u>￾</u>ventional radiology department for a percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram (PTC).</u>\n\n【12】The single image of the PTC  was acquired by opacifying the intrahepatic  删除换行 ducts with radiographic contrast during a fluoroscopy procedure. The dilated ducts of  删除换行 the left system were punctured under ultrasound guidance, and a guidewire was then  删除换行 manipulated across the hilar stricture and down into the duodenum. A sheath (8F) was  删除换行 inserted to stabilize the position, and contrast was injected through this to perform the  删除换行 cholangiogram. A stent can be passed over the wire and placed across the stenosis to  删除换行 relieve the obstruction and improve patient symptoms. This procedure is performed by  删除换行 the interventional radiology department.\n\n【13】Interventional radiology (IR) is an expanding subspeciality of radiology that uses imaging  删除换行 guidance and minimally invasive techniques to diagnose and treat a patient. A trained  删除换行 radiologist uses their experience in ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) and fluoros删除8：<u>￾</u>copy to guide the passage of a needle or catheter to a site of interest and perform a task  删除换行 that would otherwise be surgically difficult and involve significant morbidity in the form  删除换行 of an open operation. Interventional radiology consultants can use the veins, arteries and  删除换行 biliary ducts to access deep or distal lesions, vessels or organs, often leaving only a pin删除8：<u>￾</u>hole size scar at the site of puncture (often the groin) as a sign of recent treatment.

Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS)， or acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy， ischaracterized by symmetric ascending muscle weakness or paralysis that begins in the lower extremities.Hyporeflexia or areflexia is invariable but may not be present early in the course of disease.  |\n| What physical findings are commonly associated with this condition?Findings in GBS include ascending paresthesias，cranial nerve deficits leading to dysphagia，dysarthria， facial weakness， papilledema， autonomicdysfunction， and respiratory muscle paralysis inextreme cases. Figure 10-12 shows papilledema ofthe optic nerve head in GBS， along with the vascularcongestion， elevation of the nerve head， and blurreddisc margins often seen in papilledema， papillitis，and compressive lesions of the optic nerve.

Common associated infections include Campylobacter jejuni and herpesvirus. Althougha preceding event is present in most patients，approximately one third of patients with GBS report no suchevents during the preceding 1-4 weeks.  |\n| What is the etiology of this condition? GBS is thought to be an autoimmune reaction that develops in response to a previous infection or othermedical condition. This process results in aberrant demyelination of peripheral nerves and ventral motornerve roots. Cranial nerve roots can also be affected.  |\n| What laboratory finding is likely in this condition? Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) reveals a markedly elevated protein concentration with a normal cell count，commonly referred to as albuminocytologic dissociation. This contrasts the increased cell counts typicalof CNS infection. Increased CSF protein can lead to papilledema.  |\n| What is the appropriate treatment for this condition? The first element of GBS management is supportive care and treatment of the underlying condition witheither IVIG antibody or plasmapheresis. Pulmonary function should be monitored with peak flow studiesto assess for respiratory failure. Rehabilitation may be required to restore function.  |\n| If this patient's symptoms worsen over the next few months with no signs of improvement， whatalternative diagnosis should be considered? Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculopathy is a chronic， progressive， or chronic progressivecounterpart of GBS that often presents with similar symptoms.  |", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 14:06:35", "endTime": "2024/09/12 14:07:00", "cost": 24.752}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:27", "update_time": "2024-09-11 22:07:00", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 22:06:35"}

When faced with a question like this， or indeed in clinical practice with a patient like this， it is important to approach the diagnosis， investigation and management in a logical manner， informed by an understanding of the underlying epidemiology of childhood cancer， and always maintaining a focus on the emergency management of the patient during the diagnostic process.\n\n【28】In the first and second questions， regarding investigations most likely to establish a diagnosis and what that diagnosis is likely to be， you should think about which abdominal tumours may present in a child of this age. Neuroblastoma is the commonest non-central nervous system childhood solid tumour， but an abdominal mass could also be seen in hepatoblastoma， leukaemia， lymphoma， Wilm’s tumour， or an array of other rare tumours such as germ cell tumours or soft tissue sarcomas.\n\n【29】Consider Dougie's clinical features of rapid presentation， hypertension， pain and misery. These are typical of high risk neuroblastoma， but not of the other most common solid abdominal tumours. Leukaemia and lymphoma are plausible， but the normal blood count and the large abdominal mass， combined with the other clinical features， especially hypertension， make these less likely. The mass and hypertension could be present in a Wilm's tumour， but in the absence of tumour rupture， pain is less common， and the bone pain suggested by reluctance to weight bear is not seen. Hepatoblastoma would fit with the location of the mass， but again the overall clinical picture of an acutely unwell child with irritability and pain are not classical， and in terms of epidemiology hepatoblastoma is significantly less common than neuroblastoma.\n\n【30】While it is vital to understand that the only investigation which will definitively establish a diagnosis is a biopsy of the tumour， there are many investigations that will be performed prior to this， which may strongly suggest one diagnosis over the others. All of the investigations listed in question 1 will be performed， but you must focus on the wording of the question， and judge which is most likely to establish the diagnosis.\n\n【31】LDH is a non-specific test， and may be raised in any malignancy. It is useful to know as it will guide your assessment of risk of tumour lysis syndrome. Tumour lysis syndrome is an oncological emergency 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>， which results from the breakdown of dying tumour cells and the release of their intracellular contents in the form of purines and their breakdown products， ultimately uric acid， and electrolytes， particularly potassium and phosphate. Uric acid can be deposited in the renal tubules as urate crystals， leading to renal insufficiency， and the renal threshold for potassium and phosphate can be exceeded，leading to life threatening accumulation of these electrolytes. Phosphate ions can then bind with calcium to form calcium phosphate， which can also be deposited in crystalline form， further impairing renal function. Tumour lysis syndrome 删除换行 is most often precipitated by the treatment of cancer， particularly high grade B cell malignancies， or high white blood cell count leukaemia， but it can be present in any bulky tumour， and can occur spontaneously or in response to other physiological stressors such as anaesthesia or surgery.\n\n【32】Urine catecholemines measure the concentration of catecholemines， phenolic acids， and metadrenalines in the urine. These are hormones secreted by the sympathetic nervous system， and in neuroblastoma， an unregulated growth of cells with sympathetic nervous system origin， they will very commonly be abnormally raised， and in conjunction with this clinical presentation will make a diagnosis of neuroblastoma almost certain (but you still need a biopsy!).\n\n【33】Alfafetoprotein will be significantly raised in the majority of hepatoblastomas， and in secreting germ cell tumours， but will not distinguish between the two. Neurone specific enolase is an enzyme which can be over expressed by tumours whose embryological origin is the neural crest (including neuroblastoma)， and if raised， it can be useful as a marker of response to treatment， and for future monitoring for tumour recurrence. However whilst it is often raised in neuroblastoma it is neither sensitive nor specific. Ferritin may be raised in any malignancy， and is of prognostic significance in neuroblastoma， but is not diagnostic of any individual tumour.\n\n【34】In any question about the initial management of a patient， take a step back and think about the patient in front of you. Do they have any compromise of airway， breathing or circulation? Are they in pain? Is there evidence of sepsis? It is easy to become fixated on the management of the underlying condition， but unless this is vital to ABC or relieving immediate distress， it is unlikely to be the correct answer. In the third question， any of the answers are plausible， but the absolute priority is to relieve the pain that is clearly described， and this should be with carefully titrated intravenous morphine.\n\n【35】Hyperhydration is used as part of the prophylaxis of tumour lysis syndrome. Its aim is to maintain good hydration and urine output to allow clearance of the toxic metabolites released from the dying tumour cells described earlier. It will be part of the early management of this patient， but bear in mind that tumour lysis syndrome is not common in most solid malignancies， and in the presence of ascites and pleural effusion， hyperhydration should not be rushed into without careful thought and involvement of both the oncology and renal teams.\n\n【36】Emergency chemotherapy is a possibility， and may help to control the ascites and pleural effusion， and subsequently improve the pain， but it is always going to take longer to organise than the simple measure of analgesia. Radiotherapy involves the use of ionising radiation delivered to the tumour， which disrupts the formation of new DNA by tumour cells， thereby impairing their ability to replicate. Emergency radiotherapy is rarely required， is not going to have an immediate effect， and is reserved for the control of life threatening symptoms where surgery may not be possible， and chemotherapy may be challenging to deliver， such as some cases of airway compromise， mediastinal compression or spinal cord compression from the tumour. Even emergency radiotherapy will require hours or days to organise and plan， and it is therefore unlikely to be the initial step in the management of any patient. In the case of tumour rupture or uncontrolled haemorrhage from the tumour， emergency surgery may be necessary， but this is a last resort， as the overall clinical state of the child will make it extremely risky.\n\n【37】Syllabus Mapping\n\n【38】Haematology and Oncology\n\n【39】· Know the causes of bleeding， purpura and bruising and recognise features in the presentation which suggest serious underlying pathology\n\n【40】· Know the clinical manifestations of acute leukaemia， lymphoma， and solid tumours\n\n【41】·Know how to assess a child with lymphadenopathy or other masses and when to refer\n\n【42】· Know about the risks and benefits of ionising radiation", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【6】AAlfafetoproteinBCDE\n\n【7】Ferritin\n\n【8】Lactate dehydrogenase\n\n【9】Neurone Specific Enolase\n\n【10】Urine catecholemines", "content": "【0】Chapter 38： Hot and miserable Dr Hugh Bishop\n\n【1】删除5：<u>38</u>\nDougie， a 4 year old boy presents to the emergency department with a 3-day history of irritability and fever.

These are hormones secreted by the sympathetic nervous system， and in neuroblastoma， an unregulated growth of cells with sympathetic nervous system origin， they will very commonly be abnormally raised， and in conjunction with this clinical presentation will make a diagnosis of neuroblastoma almost certain (but you still need a biopsy!).\n\n【33】Alfafetoprotein will be significantly raised in the majority of hepatoblastomas， and in secreting germ cell tumours， but will not distinguish between the two. Neurone specific enolase is an enzyme which can be over expressed by tumours whose embryological origin is the neural crest (including neuroblastoma)， and if raised， it can be useful as a marker of response to treatment， and for future monitoring for tumour recurrence. However whilst it is often raised in neuroblastoma it is neither sensitive nor specific. Ferritin may be raised in any malignancy， and is of prognostic significance in neuroblastoma， but is not diagnostic of any individual tumour.\n\n【34】In any question about the initial management of a patient， take a step back and think about the patient in front of you. Do they have any compromise of airway， breathing or circulation? Are they in pain? Is there evidence of sepsis? It is easy to become fixated on the management of the underlying condition， but unless this is vital to ABC or relieving immediate distress， it is unlikely to be the correct answer. In the third question， any of the answers are plausible， but the absolute priority is to relieve the pain that is clearly described， and this should be with carefully titrated intravenous morphine.\n\n【35】Hyperhydration is used as part of the prophylaxis of tumour lysis syndrome. Its aim is to maintain good hydration and urine output to allow clearance of the toxic metabolites released from the dying tumour cells described earlier. It will be part of the early management of this patient， but bear in mind that tumour lysis syndrome is not common in most solid malignancies， and in the presence of ascites and pleural effusion， hyperhydration should not be rushed into without careful thought and involvement of both the oncology and renal teams.\n\n【36】Emergency chemotherapy is a possibility， and may help to control the ascites and pleural effusion， and subsequently improve the pain， but it is always going to take longer to organise than the simple measure of analgesia. Radiotherapy involves the use of ionising radiation delivered to the tumour， which disrupts the formation of new DNA by tumour cells， thereby impairing their ability to replicate. Emergency radiotherapy is rarely required， is not going to have an immediate effect， and is reserved for the control of life threatening symptoms where surgery may not be possible， and chemotherapy may be challenging to deliver， such as some cases of airway compromise， mediastinal compression or spinal cord compression from the tumour. Even emergency radiotherapy will require hours or days to organise and plan， and it is therefore unlikely to be the initial step in the management of any patient. In the case of tumour rupture or uncontrolled haemorrhage from the tumour， emergency surgery may be necessary， but this is a last resort， as the overall clinical state of the child will make it extremely risky.\n\n【37】Syllabus Mapping\n\n【38】Haematology and Oncology\n\n【39】· Know the causes of bleeding， purpura and bruising and recognise features in the presentation which suggest serious underlying pathology\n\n【40】· Know the clinical manifestations of acute leukaemia， lymphoma， and solid tumours\n\n【41】·Know how to assess a child with lymphadenopathy or other masses and when to refer\n\n【42】· Know about the risks and benefits of ionising radiation", "index": 1153, "show": true, "start": 1140, "end": 1262, "province": ["格式规范性", "序号格式不一致"], "isEdit": false}, {"text": "【18】AEmergency chemotherapyBCDE\n\n【19】Emergency radiotherapy\n\n【20】Intravenous hyperhydratior\n\n【21】Intravenous morphine\n\n【22】Laparotomy to remove the tumour", "content": "【0】Chapter 38： Hot and miserable Dr Hugh Bishop\n\n【1】删除5：<u>38</u>\nDougie， a 4 year old boy presents to the emergency department with a 3-day history of irritability and fever.

D： Intravenous morphine\n\n【27】It should be obvious to any paediatric trainee doctor that Dougie has a serious underlying pathological diagnosis and given the nature of presentation， with abdominal mass， hypertension and free fluid in the abdomen and chest， the most likely pathology is a malignant one. When faced with a question like this， or indeed in clinical practice with a patient like this， it is important to approach the diagnosis， investigation and management in a logical manner， informed by an understanding of the underlying epidemiology of childhood cancer， and always maintaining a focus on the emergency management of the patient during the diagnostic process.\n\n【28】In the first and second questions， regarding investigations most likely to establish a diagnosis and what that diagnosis is likely to be， you should think about which abdominal tumours may present in a child of this age. Neuroblastoma is the commonest non-central nervous system childhood solid tumour， but an abdominal mass could also be seen in hepatoblastoma， leukaemia， lymphoma， Wilm’s tumour， or an array of other rare tumours such as germ cell tumours or soft tissue sarcomas.\n\n【29】Consider Dougie's clinical features of rapid presentation， hypertension， pain and misery. These are typical of high risk neuroblastoma， but not of the other most common solid abdominal tumours. Leukaemia and lymphoma are plausible， but the normal blood count and the large abdominal mass， combined with the other clinical features， especially hypertension， make these less likely. The mass and hypertension could be present in a Wilm's tumour， but in the absence of tumour rupture， pain is less common， and the bone pain suggested by reluctance to weight bear is not seen. Hepatoblastoma would fit with the location of the mass， but again the overall clinical picture of an acutely unwell child with irritability and pain are not classical， and in terms of epidemiology hepatoblastoma is significantly less common than neuroblastoma.\n\n【30】While it is vital to understand that the only investigation which will definitively establish a diagnosis is a biopsy of the tumour， there are many investigations that will be performed prior to this， which may strongly suggest one diagnosis over the others. All of the investigations listed in question 1 will be performed， but you must focus on the wording of the question， and judge which is most likely to establish the diagnosis.\n\n【31】LDH is a non-specific test， and may be raised in any malignancy. It is useful to know as it will guide your assessment of risk of tumour lysis syndrome. Tumour lysis syndrome is an oncological emergency 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>， which results from the breakdown of dying tumour cells and the release of their intracellular contents in the form of purines and their breakdown products， ultimately uric acid， and electrolytes， particularly potassium and phosphate. Uric acid can be deposited in the renal tubules as urate crystals， leading to renal insufficiency， and the renal threshold for potassium and phosphate can be exceeded，leading to life threatening accumulation of these electrolytes. Phosphate ions can then bind with calcium to form calcium phosphate， which can also be deposited in crystalline form， further impairing renal function. Tumour lysis syndrome 删除换行 is most often precipitated by the treatment of cancer， particularly high grade B cell malignancies， or high white blood cell count leukaemia， but it can be present in any bulky tumour， and can occur spontaneously or in response to other physiological stressors such as anaesthesia or surgery.\n\n【32】Urine catecholemines measure the concentration of catecholemines， phenolic acids， and metadrenalines in the urine.

This patient has developed nasopharyngeal carcinoma, a condition common in certain parts of the world, including Asia and Africa. Development of this tumor is always associated with infection by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a DNA virus in the herpesvirus family. Development of this tumor is believed to be related to a synergistic interaction between EBV and a diet high in carcinogenic nitrosamines (common in foods that has been smoked or preserved). Common symptoms include nasal congestion, epistaxis, ear infections (due to tumor-induced blockage of the eustachian tubes), and headache.  \n\n【7】Answer B is incorrect. Many bacteria are capable of infecting the nasopharynx; however, none are directly associated with malignancy.  \n\n【8】Answer C is incorrect. Nasopharyngeal zygomycosis is a condition that could present with these symptoms in an immunocompromised patient. However, biopsy would show filamentous nonseptate hyphae and a granulomatous response.  \n\n【9】Answer D is incorrect. Although a tuberculoma in the nasopharynx can be confused with a nasopharyngeal tumor, biopsy would show caseating granulomas with multinucleated giant cells.  \n\n【10】Answer E is incorrect. Although a retrovirus such as HIV can create an immunocompromised state favoring the development of a malignancy, it is not the direct cause of tumor formation.

Physical examination reveals a febrile, dysarthric patient with retinal hemorrhages and numerous crusted puncture marks on his left forearm. Auscultation at the apex reveals a new murmur. Blood cultures reveal a gram-positive, catalase-negative organism.

This patient likely has bacterial endocarditis as a result of intravenous (IV) drug use, and the dysarthria and retinal hemorrhages are suggestive of a left-sided valvular lesion showering septic emboli to the brain and retinal arteries. The blood culture points to a Streptococcus species; these are gram positive and catalase negative. To further characterize Streptococcus , evaluate the degree of hemolysis of the plate medium. a-Hemolytic streptococci demonstrate partial hemolysis, whereas β-hemolytic streptococci show complete hemolysis. γ-Hemolytic organisms show no hemolysis and include Enterococcus species. The only organisms of this group known to cause endocarditis are the viridans group streptococci and Enterococcus faecalis . Viridans streptococcus is α hemolytic, optochin resistant, and bile soluble. E faecalis is γ hemolytic, optochin resistant, and bile soluble, but unlike the Streptococcus species, it is able to grow on 6.5% sodium chloride solution. Therefore, to differentiate between the two, 6.5% sodium chloride would be the best culture condition to isolate a single organism.  \n\n【7】Answer A is incorrect . The absence of colonies in the presence of penicillin suggests that the organism is sensitive to penicillin. Treponema pallidum and any number of streptococci are sensitive to this antibiotic; therefore, this would not be best culture condition for isolating a single type of organism.  \n\n【8】Answer C is incorrect . Both the viridans group streptococci and E faecalis are optochin resistant. Therefore, use of optochin would not help you differentiate between the two strains.  \n\n【9】Answer D is incorrect . Haemophilus influenzae is cultured on chocolate agar, along with factors V (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and X (hematin) for growth. However, this organism is not a common cause of bacterial endocarditis; rather, it causes epiglottitis, meningitis, otitis media, and pneumonia.  \n\n【10】Answer E is incorrect .

In arteriography  删除换行 it is the peripheral arteries which are first involved e.g. \n\n【5】digital arteries or dorsalis pedis artery. It may also reveal  删除换行 segmental obliteration of medium-sized arteries of the  删除换行 calf and forearm. It must be remembered that the contours  删除换行 of the large arteries remain normal and smooth. There is  删除换行 usually extensive collateral circulation surrounding the  删除换行 involved arteries which look like ‘tree-roots’ or ‘spider legs’. \n\n【6】In approximately l/4th of cases one can find aRAYNAUD’S SYNDROME, BUERGER’S DISEASE, THORACIC OUTLET SYNDROME AND CERVICAL RIB 163 删除换行 characteristic ‘cork-screw’ appearance in the vicinity of  删除换行 the affected artery, presumably due to greatly dilated vasa  删除换行 vasorum of the occluded artery.

Vasodilator drugs,  删除换行 anticoagulants, dextran, phenylbutazone, inositol and  删除换行 steroids have all been tried with limited success. More  删除换行 recently prostaglandin therapy (PGA-1) has been advocated  删除换行 to prevent platelet aggregation.\n\n【13】S U RX:i I ( ,\\ L ' i 'REATM E NT.—\n\n【14】(i) Role of sympathectomy is doubtful. Perhaps 50% \n\n【15】of patients are significantly benefited from this procedure. \n\n【16】It has got a specific role in relieving pain.\n\n【17】(ii) Arterial reconstruction is also difficult, as the  删除换行 distal arteries are usually involved. It may be considered  删除换行 in rare cases where there is segmental proximal occlusion. \n\n【18】Occasionally patients with Buerger’s disease develop  删除换行 atherosclerosis in major arteries. Such a combination may  删除换行 be suspected if the popliteal pulse is absent. In these  删除换行 patients arterial reconstruction may be performed on the  删除换行 atherosclerotic proximal arteries, which in fact causes  删除换行 marked circulatory improvement.\n\n【19】(iii) Free omental graft has been used as a source of  删除换行 arterial supply for revascularisation of ischaemic  删除换行 extremities. Such omental transfer has been particularly  删除换行 helpful where arterial reconstruction is impossible. The  删除换行 results have been gratifying as claimed by a few surgeons. \n\n【20】All the limbs became warm after the operation, rest pain  删除换行 was relieved in 90% of cases and ulcers healed in the  删除换行 same percentage of cases. Postoperative angiogram showed  删除换行 marked increase in collateral circulation. The mechanism  删除换行 of effectiveness of omental transfer is that the omental  删除换行 vessels invade the ischaemic muscle tissue. Arteriolar  删除换行 network of the omentum forms anastomosis with the  删除换行 capillaries of the diseased segment. The omental vessels  删除换行 seem to have immense capacity to increase in size at a 删除换行 rapid rate. The omental graft provides a natural blood  删除换行 supply to the limb which may even be superior to the  删除换行 direct reconstructive surgery. Such graft is particularly  删除换行 beneficial in Buerger’s disease as mostly the distal arteries  删除换行 are involved. The omental graft is fashioned by separating  删除换行 it from the greater curvature of the stomach from left to  删除换行 right so that the right gastro-epiploic vessels form the  删除换行 vascular pedicle. The omentum is lengthened and pushed  删除换行 deep to the inguinal ligament to the inferior extremity  删除换行 and spread along the length of the limb even upto the  删除换行 ankle.\n\n【21】(iv) Amputation is the only way out when gangrene  删除换行 occurs. The approach is conservative and lowest possible  删除换行 level should be chosen. When gangrene is confined to a  删除换行 toe, amputation may be postponed, unless rest pain or  删除换行 infection is rather uncontrollable. Amputation should be  删除换行 limited to the area of gangrene. When below-knee  删除换行 amputation can remove the gangrenous area, it will not  删除换行 be justified to go for above-knee amputation.\n\n【22】Prognosis.— The risk of amputation is about 20% \n\n【23】within 10 years after onset of symptoms. Although this  删除换行 varies with the use of tobacco. In a few patients who stop  删除换行 smoking completely, progression of the disease is greatly  删除换行 restricted.\n\n【24】PALPATION.—\nThe thoracic outlet syndrome is the collective name  删除换行 which includes (i) cervical rib syndrome, (ii) scalenus  删除换行 anticus syndrome, (iii) costoclavicular syndrome, (iv)  删除换行 hyperabduction syndrome, (v) pectoralis minor syndrome  删除换行 and (vi) first thoracic rib syndrome. The syndrome is  删除换行 caused by compression of the brachial plexus or subclavian  删除换行 artery and/or vein in the region near the thoracic outlet. \n\n【25】The symptoms may arise from neural, vascular or  删除换行 combined compression.\n\n【26】Anatomy.—\n\n【27】The subclavian artery leaves the thoracic cage by  删除换行 passing over the first rib between the scalenus anticus  删除换行 muscle anteriorly and the scalenus medius muscle  删除换行 posteriorly alongwith the brachial plexus It then passes  删除换行 under the clavicle and subclavius muscle to enter the axilla  删除换行 beneath the pectoralis minor muscle. The subclavian vein  删除换行 passes anterior to scalenus anticus muscle and is in  删除换行 intimate relation with the head of the clavicle and the  删除换行 most medial portion of the first rib.\n\n【28】A potential area of compression exists firstly in the  删除换行 interscalene triangle between the scalenus anticus  删除换行 anteriorly, the scalenus medius posteriorly and the first  删除换行 rib inferiorly. Distal to this area is again a narrow space\n\n【29】— intercostoclavicular space — between the clavicle and  删除换行 the first rib. In the axilla where the pectoralis minor删除27：<u>164 A TEXTBOOK ON SURGICAL SHORT CASES</u>\n\n【30】tendon attaches to the coracoid process, the axillary artery  删除换行 may be obstructed where it travels round the coracoid  删除换行 process. During hyperabduction the axillary vessels and  删除换行 the brachial plexus are bent at an angle of approximately  删除换行 90 in this area and is liable to be compressed.\n\n【31】Aetiology.—\n\n【32】(i) Cervical rib, which occurs in approximately 1% \n\n【33】of the population, produces symptoms in only 10% of  删除换行 cases. Symptoms due to cervical rib are rare in children,  删除换行 but are most frequently seen in thin women in the 3rd  删除换行 and 4th decades. Thin woman with long narrow neck  删除换行 may predispose to some variation in the anatomy of the  删除换行 head and neck. Gradual descent of the shoulder girdle  删除换行 perhaps from atrophy of the regional musculature may  删除换行 cause onset of symtoms in the 3rd or 4th decade. Again  删除换行 unusually well developed musculature may predispose  删除换行 to compression.\n\n【34】(ii) A wide scalenus anticus muscle may narrow the  删除换行 space in the interscalene triangle and cause symptoms. \n\n【35】There may be spasm, fibrosis or inflammation of the  删除换行 scalene muscles which may compress the neurovascular  删除换行 structures. There may be congenital bands within the  删除换行 muscle to compress the neurovascular structures.\n\n【36】(iii) The width of the first rib is also of consideration  删除换行 as wider first rib may give rise to symptoms.\n\n【37】(iv) Fractures of the clavicle or first rib, which  删除换行 produce subsequently bony callus, may lead to small  删除换行 subclavian aneurysm, peripheral emboli and ischaemia  删除换行 of the hand.\n\n【38】(v) Long transverse process of C7 may function as  删除换行 cervical rib.\n\n【39】(vi) Compression by tumour in the outlet space,\n\n【40】(vii) Degenerative changes such as cervicothoracic 删除换行 scoliosis may give rise to this syndrome.\n\n【41】Path ol o gy.—\n\n【42】Compression of the brachical plexus usually affects its  删除换行 lower trunk (C8 & Tl), as this is more often compressed  删除换行 by the cervical rib. The ulnar nerve is mostly involved.\n\n【43】Vascular symptoms may be intermittent from  删除换行 compression or temporary occlusion of the subclavian  删除换行 artery. Claudication with exercise, pallor, sensation of  删除换行 coldness, numbness or paraesthesia are the various vascular  删除换行 symptoms. If this condition continues, there may be  删除换行 atheromatous changes in the artery or a post-stenotic  删除换行 aneurysm may develop. From these emboli may be  删除换行 dislodged into the peripheral circulation and produce  删除换行 ischaemia of the fingers. Thrombosis of the subclavian  删除换行 artery is a late and dreadful sequence.\n\n【44】Another group of vascular symptoms is due to  删除换行 intermittent vasoconstriction similar to that seen in \n\n【45】Raynaud s phenomenon. Unilateral appearance of\n\n【46】Raynaud’s syndrome should always gives rise to suspicion  删除换行 of some pathology of thoracic outlet. The intricate cause  删除换行 is the presence of separate sympathetic nerve for upper  删除换行 extremity. Usually sympathetic innervation of the upper  删除换行 extremity is incorporated in the main trunk of the brachial  删除换行 plexus. But in only 10% of cases it comes from a separate  删除换行 cord which is more prone to direct compression and  删除换行 irritation.\n\n【47】Sometimes venous hypertension of the upper  删除换行 extremity may result from intermittent compression of  删除换行 the subclavian vein. Acute thrombosis of the subclavian  删除换行 vein may be a result of thoracic outlet syndrome but the  删除换行 exact pathologic mechanisms are not clear.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【4】Special Investigations.— Arteriography is the most  删除换行 important investigation in this condition.

The syndrome is  删除换行 caused by compression of the brachial plexus or subclavian  删除换行 artery and/or vein in the region near the thoracic outlet. \n\n【25】The symptoms may arise from neural, vascular or  删除换行 combined compression.\n\n【26】Anatomy.—\n\n【27】The subclavian artery leaves the thoracic cage by  删除换行 passing over the first rib between the scalenus anticus  删除换行 muscle anteriorly and the scalenus medius muscle  删除换行 posteriorly alongwith the brachial plexus It then passes  删除换行 under the clavicle and subclavius muscle to enter the axilla  删除换行 beneath the pectoralis minor muscle. The subclavian vein  删除换行 passes anterior to scalenus anticus muscle and is in  删除换行 intimate relation with the head of the clavicle and the  删除换行 most medial portion of the first rib.\n\n【28】A potential area of compression exists firstly in the  删除换行 interscalene triangle between the scalenus anticus  删除换行 anteriorly, the scalenus medius posteriorly and the first  删除换行 rib inferiorly. Distal to this area is again a narrow space\n\n【29】— intercostoclavicular space — between the clavicle and  删除换行 the first rib. In the axilla where the pectoralis minor删除27：<u>164 A TEXTBOOK ON SURGICAL SHORT CASES</u>\n\n【30】tendon attaches to the coracoid process, the axillary artery  删除换行 may be obstructed where it travels round the coracoid  删除换行 process. During hyperabduction the axillary vessels and  删除换行 the brachial plexus are bent at an angle of approximately  删除换行 90 in this area and is liable to be compressed.\n\n【31】Aetiology.—\n\n【32】(i) Cervical rib, which occurs in approximately 1% \n\n【33】of the population, produces symptoms in only 10% of  删除换行 cases. Symptoms due to cervical rib are rare in children,  删除换行 but are most frequently seen in thin women in the 3rd  删除换行 and 4th decades. Thin woman with long narrow neck  删除换行 may predispose to some variation in the anatomy of the  删除换行 head and neck. Gradual descent of the shoulder girdle  删除换行 perhaps from atrophy of the regional musculature may  删除换行 cause onset of symtoms in the 3rd or 4th decade. Again  删除换行 unusually well developed musculature may predispose  删除换行 to compression.\n\n【34】(ii) A wide scalenus anticus muscle may narrow the  删除换行 space in the interscalene triangle and cause symptoms. \n\n【35】There may be spasm, fibrosis or inflammation of the  删除换行 scalene muscles which may compress the neurovascular  删除换行 structures. There may be congenital bands within the  删除换行 muscle to compress the neurovascular structures.\n\n【36】(iii) The width of the first rib is also of consideration  删除换行 as wider first rib may give rise to symptoms.\n\n【37】(iv) Fractures of the clavicle or first rib, which  删除换行 produce subsequently bony callus, may lead to small  删除换行 subclavian aneurysm, peripheral emboli and ischaemia  删除换行 of the hand.\n\n【38】(v) Long transverse process of C7 may function as  删除换行 cervical rib.\n\n【39】(vi) Compression by tumour in the outlet space,\n\n【40】(vii) Degenerative changes such as cervicothoracic 删除换行 scoliosis may give rise to this syndrome.\n\n【41】Path ol o gy.—\n\n【42】Compression of the brachical plexus usually affects its  删除换行 lower trunk (C8 & Tl), as this is more often compressed  删除换行 by the cervical rib. The ulnar nerve is mostly involved.\n\n【43】Vascular symptoms may be intermittent from  删除换行 compression or temporary occlusion of the subclavian  删除换行 artery. Claudication with exercise, pallor, sensation of  删除换行 coldness, numbness or paraesthesia are the various vascular  删除换行 symptoms. If this condition continues, there may be  删除换行 atheromatous changes in the artery or a post-stenotic  删除换行 aneurysm may develop. From these emboli may be  删除换行 dislodged into the peripheral circulation and produce  删除换行 ischaemia of the fingers. Thrombosis of the subclavian  删除换行 artery is a late and dreadful sequence.\n\n【44】Another group of vascular symptoms is due to  删除换行 intermittent vasoconstriction similar to that seen in \n\n【45】Raynaud s phenomenon. Unilateral appearance of\n\n【46】Raynaud’s syndrome should always gives rise to suspicion  删除换行 of some pathology of thoracic outlet. The intricate cause  删除换行 is the presence of separate sympathetic nerve for upper  删除换行 extremity. Usually sympathetic innervation of the upper  删除换行 extremity is incorporated in the main trunk of the brachial  删除换行 plexus. But in only 10% of cases it comes from a separate  删除换行 cord which is more prone to direct compression and  删除换行 irritation.\n\n【47】Sometimes venous hypertension of the upper  删除换行 extremity may result from intermittent compression of  删除换行 the subclavian vein.

There  删除换行 is a sharp demarcation from the healthy area.\n\n<mark>【4】Special Investigations.— Arteriography is the most  删除换行 important investigation in this condition. In arteriography  删除换行 it is the peripheral arteries which are first involved e.g.\n\n【5】digital arteries or dorsalis pedis artery. It may also reveal  删除换行 segmental obliteration of medium-sized arteries of the  删除换行 calf and forearm. It must be remembered that the contours  删除换行 of the large arteries remain normal and smooth.

Vasodilator drugs,  删除换行 anticoagulants, dextran, phenylbutazone, inositol and  删除换行 steroids have all been tried with limited success.

It may be considered  删除换行 in rare cases where there is segmental proximal occlusion. \n\n【18】Occasionally patients with Buerger’s disease develop  删除换行 atherosclerosis in major arteries. Such a combination may  删除换行 be suspected if the popliteal pulse is absent. In these  删除换行 patients arterial reconstruction may be performed on the  删除换行 atherosclerotic proximal arteries, which in fact causes  删除换行 marked circulatory improvement.\n\n【19】(iii) Free omental graft has been used as a source of  删除换行 arterial supply for revascularisation of ischaemic  删除换行 extremities.

Postoperative angiogram showed  删除换行 marked increase in collateral circulation. The mechanism  删除换行 of effectiveness of omental transfer is that the omental  删除换行 vessels invade the ischaemic muscle tissue. Arteriolar  删除换行 network of the omentum forms anastomosis with the  删除换行 capillaries of the diseased segment. The omental vessels  删除换行 seem to have immense capacity to increase in size at a 删除换行 rapid rate. The omental graft provides a natural blood  删除换行 supply to the limb which may even be superior to the  删除换行 direct reconstructive surgery. Such graft is particularly  删除换行 beneficial in Buerger’s disease as mostly the distal arteries  删除换行 are involved. The omental graft is fashioned by separating  删除换行 it from the greater curvature of the stomach from left to  删除换行 right so that the right gastro-epiploic vessels form the  删除换行 vascular pedicle. The omentum is lengthened and pushed  删除换行 deep to the inguinal ligament to the inferior extremity  删除换行 and spread along the length of the limb even upto the  删除换行 ankle.\n\n【21】(iv) Amputation is the only way out when gangrene  删除换行 occurs.

When below-knee  删除换行 amputation can remove the gangrenous area, it will not  删除换行 be justified to go for above-knee amputation.\n\n<mark>【22】Prognosis.— The risk of amputation is about 20%\n\n【23】within 10 years after onset of symptoms.

Consent must always  删除换行 be gained for testing and it should be obtained from a healthcare worker other than the  删除换行 person who sustained the injury. A pre-test discussion, to establish informed consent for \n\n【15】HIV testing, should cover the benefits of testing for the individual and details of how the  删除换行 results will be given.

The risk of bloodborne virus transmission determines what action  删除换行 should be taken. Despite the fear of needlestick injuries the actual risk of contracting a blood删除8：<u>￾</u>borne infection from a sharps injury is very low. A recent Health Protection Agency report  删除换行 documented that between 2002 and 2011 there were 4381 needlestick injuries in healthcare  删除换行 workers but only 20 cases of hepatitis C infection.

It is questionable, therefore, whether there  删除换行 should be a limit to the rights of a patient, where there is a risk of harm to another individual. \n\n【20】Consequentialists would argue that it is justifiable to test an incompetent patient’s blood as  删除换行 a blood test is of minimal harm to the patient but can provide information that will pre删除8：<u>￾</u>vent harm to a healthcare worker. Usually someone who has sustained a needlestick injury  删除换行 would take post-exposure prophylactic medication as soon as possible to reduce the chance  删除换行 of transmission. This medication may have unpleasant side effects and would not need to be  删除换行 continued if the patient was tested and the test is negative for bloodborne viruses.删除5：<u>71</u>\n删除22：<u>Ethics and Law in Clinical Practice: Consent, Capacity and Refusal of Treatment</u>\n\n【21】HIV testing\n\n【22】In the UK HIV testing is voluntary and confidential. However, there has been a large drive to  删除换行 take away the stigma of testing. Although HIV is not curable it is now treatable, and if diag删除8：<u>￾</u>nosed early, patients can expect to have a normal life expectancy. Studies have demonstrated  删除换行 increased morbidity and mortality with late diagnosis and increased cost to healthcare ser删除8：<u>￾</u>vices. Knowledge of HIV status is associated with a reduction in risky behaviour, and there删除8：<u>￾</u>fore early diagnosis will result in reduced onward transmission.\n\n【23】The British HIV Association UK National Guidelines for HIV Testing 通用删除7(英):<u>(2008)</u> provides that \n\n【24】HIV testing should be offered routinely to patients who present for healthcare where HIV,  删除换行 including primary HIV infection, enters the differential diagnosis and where a male patient  删除换行 has disclosed sexual contact with other men. Consent must be obtained for testing. It is rec删除8：<u>￾</u>ommend that an individual testing HIV-positive should be seen by a specialist at the earliest  删除换行 possible opportunity, preferably within 48 hours and certainly within 2 weeks of receiving  删除换行 the result.\n\n【25】Screening\n\n【26】There are circumstances where HIV testing should be routinely offered and patients need to  删除换行 opt out rather than opt in. This could be considered screening rather than testing as the indi删除8：<u>￾</u>vidual may have no other markers of illness. Areas where this is offered include Genitourinary  删除换行 medicine clinics, antenatal screening and even in areas of the country where HIV has a prev删除8：<u>￾</u>alence of more than 2/1000 population.\n\n【27】Interestingly, a recent study has reported that non-targeted, routine offering of HIV screen删除8：<u>￾</u>ing in a variety of different healthcare settings not only demonstrated a high uptake but also  删除换行 a positive public perception that this is appropriate 删除10：<u>(Rayment et al. 2012)</u>. Stigma attached  删除换行 to HIV infection is still widespread, yet the at-risk population has changed considerably in  删除换行 the last decade. The availability of effective treatment means that HIV testing should be as  删除换行 socially acceptable as diabetes screening.\n\n【28】Key Points\n\n【29】• Consent must be obtained to test for HIV no matter what the clinical circumstance  删除换行 or setting.\n\n【30】• HIV testing in patients who lack capacity can only be performed if it is in their best  删除换行 interests.\n\n【31】• Every healthcare professional should feel able to discuss HIV testing in the same  删除换行 way that they would gain consent to test for any other medical condition.删除5：<u>73</u>\n删除22：<u>Ethics and Law in Clinical Practice: Consent, Capacity and Refusal of Treatment</u>", "index": 3788, "show": true, "start": 3762, "end": 4403, "province": ["格式规范性", "多余换行"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/09/12 11:39:40", "endTime": "2024/09/12 11:41:00", "cost": 79.215}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:27", "update_time": "2024-09-11 19:41:00", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 19:39:40"}

His body temperature was between 38 °C and 39 °C. After receiving infusion of penicillin and second-generation cephalosporin for 2 days, he developed congest rashes on the back on Day 5 of illness. Local pediatrician suspected they were drug related rashes and switched antibiotics to fosfomycin sodium for one day. Those rashes increased and he developed strikingly red lips and bilateral conjunctival congestion on Day 10. Antibiotics was switched again to cefobid and dexamethasone 5 mg. Fever only settled for 30 hours. On Day 11, fever recurred and he developed peeling skin around fingernails. On Day 12, he was admitted in our pediatric cardiology ward. He had diarrhea 3–4 times per day since antibiotics infusion, without vomiting or coughing. Examination revealed T36.5°C, smooth breath (PR 120bpm, RR 30bpm), weight 7kg. General condition was well. He had red lips and erythema around BCG scar. Hepatomegaly was 2 cm below right costal margin. Others were normal. CBC on Day 7 revealed WBC16.7×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, NE 47%.

Echo showed LCA was dilated about 4.3mm , RCA 2.7mm , LVED 24 mm. Chest DR was normal. For he had met all criteria of KD, he was treated with oral aspirin 50mg/kg/day and dipyridamole 3–5 mg/kg/day, both in 2 to 3 divided doses. On Day 14, fever stayed between 38°C and 38.5°C, with mild coughing. ECG showed ST section elevation 2mm on lead II, III, aVF . He was given infusion of FDP and erythromycin. On Day 15, fever was still 38.5°C and left eye could not close and his mouth drooped toward to right when crying. Examination found that erythema around BCG disappeared. He had developed left infranuclear facial palsy. He was given infusion of vitamin B. Meanwhile head MRI was ordered. On Day 17, his body temperature was about 38°C. EEG showed normal results . The lumbar puncture failed due to bleeding. On Day 19, he still had a fever about 38.2°C. Conjunctival congestion regressed, but left red lips remained. Peeling skin occurred around toenails.

His head MRI showed there was a 7mm cystic lesion in left paracele, and the subarachnoid space of frontal lobe was slightly widened (images lost during the transition of system upgrading). He was treated with fast infusion of 20% mannitol 25ml every 12 hours. That night, he developed polypnea, RR was up to 60 bpm, along with cyanosis and edema on his face, oliguria, low-dull heart sounds, HR 140 bpm. Hepatomegaly mark was 5cm below right costal margin and 5cm below the xiphoid, spleen was 2cm below left costal margin. He had edema in lower limbs extremity. ECG showed elevated ST section 0.2mv on lead II, III, and aVF (Image was not scanned due to weak signals). Chest DR showed enlarged heart, and the cardio-thoracic ratio was 0.62, indicating pulmonary edema. He had developed acute heart failure, and aseptic meningitis. Thus, he was transferred to PICU and treated with cediland fast saturation in half dose, furosemidum infusion and reduced mannitol at dose of 2.5ml/kg, every 12 hours. He was sedated using 5% chloral hydrate. Nasal tubing was used for oxygen inhaling. FDP infusion was given to him, and zinacef infusion was changed from twice per day to every 8 hours. On Day 21, his general state was improved. Peeling skin settled. He had fever at 38.5°C occurring two times a day, along with red lips, vomiting (once coffee like content).

On Day 15, fever was still 38.5°C and left eye could not close and his mouth drooped toward to right when crying. Examination found that erythema around BCG disappeared. He had developed left infranuclear facial palsy. He was given infusion of vitamin B. Meanwhile head MRI was ordered. On Day 17, his body temperature was about 38°C. EEG showed normal results . The lumbar puncture failed due to bleeding. On Day 19, he still had a fever about 38.2°C. Conjunctival congestion regressed, but left red lips remained. Peeling skin occurred around toenails. Investigation revealed WBC 15.6×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, NE 55%, RBC 4.14×10 <sup>12 </sup> /L, HGB 92g/L, PLT 739×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L. Blood culture was negative. His TCD showed there was insufficient blood supply in bilateral cerebral artery and left anterior artery . Lumbar puncture was re-performed. CSF was slightly yellow and mixed.

His head MRI showed there was a 7mm cystic lesion in left paracele, and the subarachnoid space of frontal lobe was slightly widened (images lost during the transition of system upgrading). He was treated with fast infusion of 20% mannitol 25ml every 12 hours. That night, he developed polypnea, RR was up to 60 bpm, along with cyanosis and edema on his face, oliguria, low-dull heart sounds, HR 140 bpm. Hepatomegaly mark was 5cm below right costal margin and 5cm below the xiphoid, spleen was 2cm below left costal margin. He had edema in lower limbs extremity. ECG showed elevated ST section 0.2mv on lead II, III, and aVF (Image was not scanned due to weak signals). Chest DR showed enlarged heart, and the cardio-thoracic ratio was 0.62, indicating pulmonary edema. He had developed acute heart failure, and aseptic meningitis. Thus, he was transferred to PICU and treated with cediland fast saturation in half dose, furosemidum infusion and reduced mannitol at dose of 2.5ml/kg, every 12 hours. He was sedated using 5% chloral hydrate. Nasal tubing was used for oxygen inhaling. FDP infusion was given to him, and zinacef infusion was changed from twice per day to every 8 hours. On Day 21, his general state was improved. Peeling skin settled. He had fever at 38.5°C occurring two times a day, along with red lips, vomiting (once coffee like content). Blood sample analysis revealed WBC 21.7×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, RBC 4.6×10 <sup>12 </sup> /L, HGB 91g/L, PLT 528×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, CRP 235mg/L. He had developed delayed vitamin K deficiency. Intramuscular injection of 7mg vitamin K <sub>1 </sub> was given for three days. He never vomited again. On Day 27, he had fever at 39.5°C. His red lips improved. Laboratory findings revealed WBC 17.7×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, NE 50.2%, RBC 4.94×10 <sup>12 </sup> /L, HGB 108g/L, PLT 208×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L. ESR12mm.TB 51.8g/L, ALB 28.6g/L.

Assessment of the eye begins with measuring visual acuity. Acute vision loss or unexplained low vision warrants urgent referral(to an ophthalmologist or emergency room depending upon the clinical scenario (e.g.， for risk factors for ocular or neurological disease， recent ocular injury， or foreign body). If foreign body or possible corneal scratch is suspected， fluorescein staining and Wood's lamp examination may be done.\n\n【2】If overall visual acuity is within the usual range， a screening test for macular degeneration should be done using an Amsler grid 删除10：<u>(Jager， Mieler， & Miller， 2008)</u>. Anew Internet version of this test entitled MacuFlow is now available but has not been extensively tested 删除10：<u>(Frisén， 2009)</u>. Other helpful assess-ment tools include the National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire 25 (NEV-VFQ-25) and the Pelli-Robson contrast sensitivity chart 删除10：<u>(Pelli， Robson， & Wilkins， 1988； Revicki， Rentz， Harnam， Thomas， & Lanzetta， 2010)</u>. There is no evidence that vision screening in asymptomatic older adults results in improved clinical outcomes， but these tests may help to detect hidden disease in persons at higher risk and also may assist the clinician in developing an individually tailored plan of care for older adults with visual impairment. Optimizing visual acuity is an important component of multi-component interventions to prevent geriatric syndromes such as delirium 删除10：<u>(Chou， Dana， & Bougatsos，2009； Inouye， Fearing， & Marcantonio， 2009)</u>.\n\n【3】Which of the symptoms or signs related to Maureen's eyes or vision represent pathological changes versus normal aging?\n\n【4】Maureen reports gradual， insidious changes in her vision. Her fear of blindness relates to her concern about having macular degeneration (like her mother). Normal aging changes in the eyes may result in an increased sensitivity to glare， difficulty with light/dark adaptation， decreased color discrimina-tion， and loss of acuity in low-contrast and low-light conditions. Pupil size decreases. Visual process-ing time may also be decreased， potentially affecting reading and driving； but this may improve with training. While ectropion (outward turning of the lids) is not a normal aging change， it is a common， correctable condition 删除10：<u>(Duthie， 2007； Sterns & McCormick， 2007； Watson， 2009)</u>.\n\n【5】What are the three most common diagnoses/conditions affecting vision in older adults\n\n【6】Maureen's signs and symptoms similar to the clinical presentations of these conditions? The three most common pathological conditions in older adults include cataracts (most common cause of low vision in the elderly)， glaucoma， and macular degeneration. Diabetic retinopathy is also common in diabetics 删除10：<u>(Sterns & McCormick， 2007； Watson， 2009)</u>. Vision loss affects safety (driving， falls， identifying and dosing medicines)， function (reading， television， work， recreation)， and cogni-tion (orienting cues， recognition， risk for delirium). Symptoms of cataracts include increased sensitiv-ity to glare and/or to light， decreased contrast sensitivity and decreased blue-yellow color vision. Although glaucoma decreases peripheral vision， the loss is gradual and rarely noticed until severe. Macular degeneration results in blurred or distorted central vision or central vision loss. Unless hemorrhage occurs， changes are gradual and may not be noticed until moderate or severe. None of these conditions is painful. Pain in the eye suggests a serious condition that must be evaluated promptly. Sudden vision loss in part or all of the visual field in one or both eyes is an emergency and may represent ocular， neural， or vascular pathology (including stroke， retinal hemorrhage). Older adults are also at higher risk for a condition known as temporal arteritis (also called“giant cell arte-ritis\") which may present with headache and sudden vision loss. Immediate evaluation and treatment are necessary to prevent permanent blindness and to differentiate this condition from acute stroke删除10：<u>(Nakasato & Carnes， 2009；Sterns & McCormick， 2007)</u>.\n\n【7】What is your plan of care? Are any referrals needed?\n\n【8】A dilated retinal examination is needed to more thoroughly assess the health of the retina and macula. Maureen is referred to an ophthalmologist for this examination， as well as a measurement of eye pressure and peripheral vision testing.\n\n【9】What if Maureen were <65? Would that change your management plan?\n\n【10】These symptoms would be suspicious for ocular pathology in a younger person and comprehensive assessment and ophthalmology followup would be essential. Macular degeneration is almost exclu-sively found in persons over age 55 and cataracts in a younger person are usually secondary to other diseases/conditions.\n\n【11】Younger patients who present with TIA/stroke are more likely to have undiagnosed coagulopa-thies. If there are no vascular risk factors and no other apparent causes， diagnostics should be guided by history and physical exam and may include protein C， protein S，antithrombin III， activated protein C resistance/factor V Leiden， anticardiolipin antibody， lupus anticoagulant， and Von Willebrand factor 删除10：<u>(Easton et al.，2009)</u>. Younger patients have different risk/benefit ratios in terms of surgery and anticoagulation.\n\n【12】What patient， family， and caregiver education is important in this case?\n\n【13】Important topics for education include primary prevention (e.g.， heart healthy diet， weight control， blood pressure control， no smoking and sun protection)； the importance of eye exams (especially for persons with eye disease or risk factors)； the benefits of contrasting colors； the importance of adequate lighting； strategies to avoid glare and shadow； and the availability of low-vision aids such as magni-fiers， large print， computer enhancements， talking books， and watches. Vision rehabilitation is helpful for persons with visual loss that is affecting function or quality of life.\n\n【14】A few weeks after the visit described above， you receive a phone call from Maureen telling you that she had an episode of slurred speech and she could not move her right arm for about 5minutes. The symptoms occurred 30 minutes ago. She feels fine now but she is frightened.\n\n【15】What advice to you give to Maureen and why?\n\n【16】You advise Maureen to seek immediate evaluation in the emergency room. Her symptoms are consistent with a transient ischemic attack (TIA) but cannot be differentiated from a stroke without neurovascular imaging. The most common symptoms of brain ischemia include sudden weakness or numbness on one side (face， arm or leg)， trouble speaking or slurred speech， trouble walking (due to sudden unexplained dizziness， loss of coordination or sudden “drop” attack and fall)， or trouble seeing (sudden loss of visual field， sudden monocular or binocular vision loss， blurred vision or diplopia). Headaches， tinnitus and hearing loss may accompany vertebrobasilar insufficiency.\n\n【17】The ABCD\"mnemonic is used to stratify the risk for subsequent stroke in patients with TIA symp-toms. Points are given based on age， blood pressure， clinical presentation including site and duration of symptoms， and the presence or absence of diabetes. Persons with 23 points are considered high risk and should be evaluated in the hospital 删除10：<u>(Easton et al.， 2009)</u>.\n\n【18】Older definitions characterized TIA as a focal neurologic deficit of acute onset that completely resolves within 24 hours. The American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) revised the definition in 2009 and provided updated guidelines for initial evaluation. Many patients with symptoms meeting the older definition of TIA were found to have magnetic resonance-detectable brain injury. Furthermore， the risk of stroke in the early post-TIA period was found to be higher than expected. Prompt workup and risk factor management may delay or prevent subsequent brain injury. The new definition of TIA is \"a transient episode of neurological dysfunction caused by focal brain， spinal cord， or retinal ischemia， without acute infarction\" 删除10：<u>(Adams et al.， 2007； Easton et al.， 2009； Hershey， 2007)</u>.\n\n【19】What diagnostic evaluation will you complete?\n\n【20】Along with stroke， the differential diagnosis of focal neurological deficits would include migraine aura， seizure， intracranial mass (e.g.， tumor， hematoma)， hypoglycemia， dissecting aortic aneurysm， and conditions leading to syncope or hyperventilation. If symptoms are confined to the face， Bell’s palsy may be included； and if they primarily comprise of loss of vision， visual field， or acute vision 删除换行 changes， ocular neuropathy or intraocular pathology may be included. Temporal arteritis (also known as giant cell arteritis) is a form of vasculitis that occurs almost exclusively in persons over age 50 and may present with temporal headache and/or sudden loss of vision. Permanent blindness may result unless this condition is diagnosed and treated promptly. Persons with rheumatoid arthritis are at higher risk for this disease.\n\n【21】If Maureen's clinical presentation had been less severe (a score of 1 or 2 on the ABCD) and she was considered low risk in the initial emergency department evaluation， she might be referred back to her primary care provider (same day visit) for further evaluation. Physician collaboration is recom-mended in planning and implementing a comprehensive and cost-effective workup that includes appropriate neurovascular imaging. The AHA/ASA guidelines recommend imaging within 24 hours of symptom onset， preferably with MRI， including diffusion-weighted imaging. If MRI is not avail-able， a head CT is recommended. Doppler ultrasound， transcranial ultrasound， MR angiography， or CT angiography are used to detect carotid vascular pathology. An EKG should be done to detect atrial fibrillation， a common cause of thrombus formation； and lab work should include CBC， chem-istry profile， and PT/PTT (to rule out hypoglycemia or other metabolic abnormalities， polycythemia vera， and hypercoagulopathy). If no other cause is found， a cardiac echo may be needed to rule out patent foramen ovale， valve disease， and other conditions associated with cardiogenic thrombus formation 删除10：<u>(Easton et al.， 2009)</u>. The majority of strokes in the elderly are ischemic (often due to cardiac embolism or small vessel disease) versus hemorrhagic. Atherosclerosis of the carotid or atheroscle rosis of the vertebral arteries are also potential causes 删除10：<u>(Hershey， 2007)</u>.\n\n【22】What education is needed?\n\n【23】Maureen and her family need to learn about the importance of stroke prevention strategies and immediate transfer to the emergency department for evaluation in the event of symptoms. In the case ofa stroke， it is important for the public to understand，“Time is brain，\" meaning that the longer emergency treatment is delayed， the greater the risk of brain cell damage and brain cell death， leading to permanent dis- ability.“Clot-busting\"agents (if indicated) must be given within the first 3 hours after onset of symp-toms for optimal effect (1 hour is optimal).\n\n【24】Patients and family members are taught to recognize the signs of a \"brain attack\" or stroke using the mnemonic“FAST.”\n\n【25】F (Face)-Ask the person to smile. Does one side of the face droop?\n\n【26】A (Arms)-Ask the person to raise both arms. Does one arm drift downward?\n\n【27】S (Speech)-Ask the person to repeat a simple sentence. Are the words slurred or is there difficulty repeating the sentence correctly?\n\n【28】● T (Time)-If the person has any one of these symptoms， they should activate EMS (call 911) and go to the hospital immediately. Emergency personnel will want to know the last known symptom-free time， since duration of symptoms is an important parameter in calculating the risk/benefit of various treatment options. A family member or friend should travel to the hospital， if possible， to provide information.\n\n【29】Other symptoms of stroke include trouble seeing in one or both eyes， trouble walking， dizziness， loss of balance or coordination， or sudden severe headache with no known cause.\n\n【30】What is your management plan?\n\n【31】Acute/initial inpatient management includes evaluation for tPA therapy， aspirin administration， skillful management of blood pressure， hydration and blood sugar， prevention of iatrogenic complica-tions， comprehensive rehabilitation， and early discharge planning.\n\n【32】After stabilization and discharge， the nurse practitioner has a critical role in partnering with the patient to facilitate risk factor reduction， to reduce the likelihood of future strokes， disability， and possibly vascular dementia. It is important to optimize therapy for hypertension， smoking cessation， hyperlipidemia， diabetes mellitus， and atrial fibrillation. Antiplatelet therapy is used for secondary prevention of noncardioembolic， ischemic stroke 删除10：<u>(Adams et al.， 2007)</u>. Anticoagulation (with warfa-rin) is used instead of antiplatelet therapy for patients with atrial fibrillation. Older adults are at higher risk of bleeding from antiplatelet and/or anticoagulation therapy， and the risk-to-benefit ratio needs to be evaluated for each patient， guided by the latest available evidence. Physician consultation 删除换行 and collaboration is recommended. Age alone is not a contraindication to anticoagulant therapy， and there is evidence of undertreatment in high-risk older adults 删除10：<u>(Adams et al.， 2007)</u>. Patients with carotid stenosis >70% should be referred for surgical evaluation without delay. It is recommended that surgery be performed within 2 weeks of TIA symptoms in order to minimize morbidity and mortality 删除10：<u>(Adams et al.， 2007；Easton et al.， 2009)</u>.\n\n【33】If Maureen was admitted to the hospital with a CVA she would very likely be discharged to a rehabilitation hospital following her hospital course.\n\n【34】What are some of the most important domains of nursing assessment and management\n\n【35】(physical， psychological) in the early post-stroke period?\n\n【36】Goals in the early post-stroke period are to restore maximal function and too assist with emotional and physical adjustment during the rehabilitation period. Skillful nursing assessment， care，education and monitoring are needed in collaboration with the interdisciplinary team， the patient and the family. The goals of care include maintaining or improving mobility， self-care， communication， swal-lowing， bladder control， bowel function， sexual function， emotional adjustment and family coping. Instructing formal and informal caregivers is an important nursing role in order to prevent injury(e.g.， shoulder dislocation)， avoidable complications (choking， aspiration， fecal impaction)， and frus-tration related to unrealistic expectations and unmet needs for adaptive equipment， technologies or assistance. Systematic cognitive and psychosocial assessments are required to enable early interven-tion and management of complications such as anxiety， depression， and visuospatial neglect. Frequent consultation with physical， occupational， and speech therapy will facilitate appropriate tailoring of the rehabilitation plan； and social service involvement is critical to service planning and coordination across health care settings 删除10：<u>(Mauk & Hanson， 2010)</u>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 14:29:40", "endTime": "2024/09/12 14:30:08", "cost": 27.949}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:27", "update_time": "2024-09-11 22:30:09", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 22:29:41"}

Upon examination of the patient's neck， the physician notes a firm nodule in the right upper lobe of the thyroid that remains fixed with swallowing. Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) reveals ground-glass cytoplasm， inclusion bodies， and calcifications.\n\n| What is the most likely diagnosis?Papillary thyroid cancer.  |\n| --- |\n| What is the prevalence of this condition? Thyroid cancer represents approximately 1% of all human cancers. Papillary thyroid cancer is the mostcommon type (~ 85%). Other types include follicular (~10%)， medullary (5%)， and anaplastic (1%). Papillaryand follicular types make up the well-differentiated thyroid cancers， whereas the medullary and anaplastictypes are considered poorly differentiated.  |\n| How is this condition diagnosed? Careful physical examination， serum thyroid function tests， ultrasound， and FNA of the thyroid. The first diagnostic step is measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. The next step is imagingof the mass with ultrasound and/or radioactive iodine scans. In a patient with a functional nodule thatproduces thyroid hormone， TSH levels are expected to be suppressed. These functional or\"hot\"nodules(called \"hot\" because of their appearance on radioactive iodine scanning) are rarely malignant and thusdo not necessitate biopsy. By contrast， a patient with a nonfunctional thyroid mass (called a \"cold\" nodule)requires biopsy to evaluate for malignancy.  |\n| What characteristic features of this condition are likely to be seen on excisional biopsy?There is no single pathognomonic feature of papillary thyroid cancer. However， the combination ofground-glass\" cytoplasm， \"Orphan Annie\" inclusion bodies， prominent nuclei with clefts and grooves，and calcified psammoma bodies point to the diagnosis.  |\n| What are the risk factors for this condition?

But there are other patients with opportunistic infections indicative of a combined immunodeficiency who have either normal or selectively decreased numbers of circulating lymphocytes with impaired T cell function.\n\n【2】T-cell activation depends on the intracellular influx of ions， such as Ca’t and Mg， which serve as second messengers critical for signaling downstream of the T-cell receptor (TCR). Cytoplasmic ion concentrations are regulated by transporters that facilitate ion movement into the cytoplasm from intracellular stores or the extracellular milieu. One pathway that connects TCRs， Ca+ fluxes， and lymphocyte effector functions is depicted in Fig. 55.1 and described next. After TCR engagement， proximal signaling molecules， including phospholipase C-y1(PLC-y1)， are activated， leading to the release of Ca\"+ from endoplasmic reticulum(ER) stores. Carelease from the ER is sensed by stromal interaction molecules 1and 2(STIMl and STIM2)， which undergo a conformational change， multimerize， and translocate along the ER membrane to ER-plasma membrane junctions. The STIM complex interacts with and activates ORAIl， a transmembrane protein that functions as the pore-forming subunit of the calcium release-activated calcium channels (CRAC channels) on the plasma membrane. Ca+ influx through CRAC channels triggers the phosphatase calcineurin to dephosphorylate nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)， a transcription factor， which translocates to the nucleus and stimulates cytokine production， cellular proliferation， and induction of cell-mediated cytotoxicity.\n\n【3】In addition to its critical role in lymphocyte activation， ORAI1 is ubiquitously expressed and contributes to the functioning of skeletal muscle and development of ectodermal structures， such as dental enamel and sweat glands. The following case highlights the devastating effect of impaired ion homeostasis and emphasizes the diverse presentations associated with combined immunodeficiencies.\n\n【4】This case was prepared by Luigi Notarangelo， MD， in collaboration with Janet Chou， MD， and Yousef R. Badran， MD.\n删除3：<u>Fig. 55.1 Ca2+ signaling in T lymphocytes. Engagement of the T cell receptor (TCR) enables activation of PLC-y1， thereby allowing generation of inositol 1，4，5-triphosphate (InsP3) (a)， that binds to receptors in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)， and mediates release of Ca2+ from the ER stores (b). As ER Ca²+stores are depleted， Ca2+ dissociates from the STIM1 molecules， which undergo conformational changes， oligomerization (C)， and translocation to the junction of the ER-plasma membrane 删除换行 junction (d). These changes activate the ORAI1 proteins， thereby opening CRAC channels and allowing extracellular Ca-+ to flow into the cell. The Ca²+ influx activates the phosphatase calcineurin to dephosphorylate“Nuclear Factor of Activated Tcells”(NFAT)(e)， which can then translocate to the nucleus， where it mediates transcription of NFAT-dependent genes involved in cytokine production， cellular proliferation， and cell-mediated cytotoxicity</u>\n\n【5】The case of Ali Baba： a defect in calcium channels leading to recurrent infections， hypotonia， and ectodermal dysplasia.\n\n【6】Ali Baba， a 9-month-old boy， was hospitalized for a month for a severe pneumonia that was unresponsive to therapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Ali was born full-term by normal vaginal delivery and weighed 3.0 kg at birth， but was noted by the neonatologist to be hypotonic. Since 2 weeks of age， Ali suffered from recurrent episodes of pneumonia requiring intravenous antibiotic therapy. He had mucoid- bloody diarrhea for the 5 months prior to hospitalization， which persisted despite antimicrobial management and dietary changes. His weight dropped from the 40th percentile at 4 months of age to the 10th percentile.\n\n【7】His physical examination revealed white plaques of thrush consistent with Candida albicans on his oral mucosa， and his teeth showed loss of enamel with pitting. His skin was very dry and his limbs had poor tone. He was tachypneic and his breath sounds were coarse and harsh.\n\n【8】Ali's white blood count was 10，000 cells u.l- (normal 6，400-13，000) and his abso-lute lymphocyte count was 5，000 cells pl-1 删除10：<u>(normal 3400-9000)</u>. His T，B， and natural 删除换行 killer (NK) cell counts were all normal. His levels of lgG， IgA， and IgM were normal. His peripheral blood mononuclear cells responded poorly to stimulation by mito-gens， as well as to tetanus and candida antigens. His chest X-ray showed multilobar pneumonia and a normal sized thymus. Bronchoalveolar lavage cultures from his bronchoscopy were positive for cytomegalovirus (CMV).\n\n【9】Ali’s family history uncovered that his parents are first cousins. Additionally， they reported that their first daughter had a history of hypotonia and passed away 4years ago at the age of 5 months due to sepsis.\n\n【10】Due to the history of opportunistic infections， hypotonia， abnormal dental enamel， dry skin， and poor T cell activation， a defect in the gene for ORA/1 or STIM1 was suspected. To evaluate store-operated Ca+ entry in Ali’s peripheral blood mononu-clear cells (PBMCs)， the cells were exposed to thapsigargin， which inhibits the Ca²+ ATPase responsible for reuptake of Ca2+ into the ER. This induces in vitro depletion of ER Ca2+ stores， thus triggering the opening of the CRAC channels. The influx of Ca2+ into his PBMCs was assessed by flow cytometry using a labeled calcium indi-cator whose fluorescence increases in intensity after binding to free intracellular calcium . Sequencing of Ali’s ORAl1 gene identified a frameshift mutation resulting in a premature stop codon 3 located three amino acids after the protein’s start site. Western blot analysis showed no ORAI1 protein expression in Ali’s PBMCs.\n\n【11】Upon identification of the gene defect， Ali received hematopoietic stem cell trans-plantation from a matched unrelated donor. The conditioning regimen used for the transplant included Busulfan， Fludarabine， and Alemtuzumab. At 18 months after transplantation，Ali has attained full immune reconstitution. In particular， his T cells proliferate normally in response to phytohemagglutinin (187，000 counts per minute； normal value： 127，000-265，000 cpm)， and to candida (32，000 cpm； normal value：12，500-46，000 cpm). However， his muscular hypotonia has remained unchanged， consistent with the notion that hematopoietic stem cell transplantation does not correct extra-immune manifestations of ORAl1 deficiency.\n\n【12】ORAl1 deficiency.\n\n【13】ORAIl deficiency is a rare and severe form of autosomal recessive combined immunodeficiency， first described in 2006. Homozygous mutations in ORAI1 删除换行 lead to CRAC channel-pore defects that significantly impair extracellular calcium entry into the cells after depletion of Cat stores in the ER. The combined immu-nodeficiency associated with ORAIl deficiency results in recurrent infections with bacteria， viruses， and fungi beginning within the first months of life. This immu-nodeficiency arises from the critical role of SOCE and NFAT in T-cell activation， as evidenced by impaired lymphocyte proliferation to mitogens and antigens， and by defective cytokine production. Defective T-cell activation also impairs the antigen-specific response， since ORAI1-deficient patients can have reduced antibody titers after vaccination despite normal total immunoglobulin levels. Additionally， the recurrent viral infections seen in patients with ORAI1 mutations reflect the contri-bution of SOCE to cytotoxic T-cell degranulation and NK-cell killing.\n\n【14】Patients with ORAIl deficiency have a constellation of non-immune problems due to the wide expression of ORAI1 in the body. As seen in Ali， patients have global muscular hypotonia due to the role of ORAI1 in the development and function of skeletal muscle fibers， leading to respiratory muscle insufficiency. Since ORAI1is also expressed in ectodermal structures， patients with ORAIl deficiency suffer from anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia， resulting in impaired sweating and hypoc-alcified dental enamel. Although ORAIl is expressed in other cell types， such as endocrine glands and hepatocytes， patients with ORAI1 deficiency typically do not present with abnormalities in these organs， most likely because of compensation from other Ca+ channels\n\n【15】Due to the essential role of STIMl in recruiting ORAIl and thus triggering SOCE， patients with homozygous mutations in STIMl share nearly identical clinical fea-tures with patients lacking ORAI1. A subset of patients with mutations in STIM1have also presented with autoimmune manifestations， including cytopenias， lym-phadenopathy， and splenomegaly. These features of immune dysregulation have been ascribed to the reduced numbers of Treg cells found in some patients with STIMl deficiency.\n\n【16】In addition to Ca\"+ channel defects， defects in MAGT1， a Mg’-specific channel， have been described as a cause of X-linked immunodeficiency. Patients present with recurrent respiratory infections， chronic diarrhea， and Epstein-Barr virus(EBV)-associated malignancies. In contrast to patients with ORAIl or STIM1defects， these patients have CD4+ lymphopenia and reduced numbers of recent thymic immigrants， indicating the importance of Mgin T cell development and proliferation. Defective Mg’influx in these patients results in decreased PLC-Y1activation and inositol 1，4，5-triphosphate (InsP3) generation， leading to impaired Ca²+ influx and， ultimately， poor T-cell activation. Defects in MAGT1 also lead to loss of expression of NKG2D， a receptor on cytotoxic Tlymphocytes and NK cells important for antitumor and antiviral cytotoxicity. This contributes to the specific susceptibility ofthese patients to EBVinfections and EBV-associated malignancies， which are not seen in patients with ORAIl and STIM1 deficiency.\n\n【17】The diagnosis of a channelopathy can be made quickly by assessing ion flux after specific stimuli. To assess for a suspected defect in ORAIl or STIM1， thapsigargin is used to deplete Ca+ stores in the ER and trigger SOCE. For patients with a sus-pected MAGT1 defect， mediators of T-cell activation (such as anti-CD3， phytohe-magglutinin or concanavalin A) are used to trigger Mg’and Ca+flux.Additionally， due to the role of MAGT1 in regulating the expression of NKG2D， flow cytometry can be used to assess expression of NKG2Don CD8 and NK cells. If a patient dem-onstrated impaired ion flux in vitro， the genetic diagnosis is then made by Sanger sequencing the genes encoding specific channels. Like Ali， patients with homozy-gous mutations in ORAIl will have nearly absent calcium flux.\n\n【18】Once the diagnosis is made， treatment must address the specific aspects of each patient's disease. For example， antibiotic prophylaxis against Pneumocystis pneu-monia (PCP) is warranted， and patients should be started on infusions of gamma globulin if they lack antigen-specific antibodies. Patients with ORAI1 or STIM1deficiency have a high risk of life-threatening sepsis early in childhood， and only 删除换行 hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is curative. Patients with MAGT1 defects have a high risk of infections with EBV， which may require treatment with anti-CD20 antibody (rituximab). Oral Mg2+supplementation has been shown to restore intracellular Mg²+concentrations， improve NKG2D expression， and decrease num-bers of EBV-infected B cells in a few patients with MAGT1 mutations， thus consti-tuting a possible alternative therapy for patients lacking a matched stem cell donor.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 14:24:44", "endTime": "2024/09/12 14:25:09", "cost": 25.547}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:27", "update_time": "2024-09-11 22:25:10", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 22:24:44"}

He became hypoxic with subsequent respiratory failure unresponsive to non‐invasive ventilation, so was intubated and placed on a ventilator. The patient then developed fluid‐refractory shock and required vasopressor support. After 48 hours, his respiratory status began to improve along with his blood pressure, and vasopressor support was weaned off. He remained on a ventilator for a total of 6 days, with sedation and pain management achieved with morphine and midazolam continuous infusions. As his status has improved, sedation has been weaned to allow him to be more awake yet comfortable.Past Medical History\n--------------------\n\n【5】This patient was born at term via spontaneous vaginal delivery and discharged home with his mother. He has received required immunizations along with a flu vaccine this season. His weight has been steady at 75% for gender and age and his current body mass index (BMI) is 22.5. He has had no previous hospitalizations.Past Surgical History\n---------------------\n\n【6】This child had tympanostomy tubes placed at 15 months of age for frequent episodes of otitis media; no complications during the procedure or postoperatively.Family History\n--------------\n\n【7】The patient lives with the paternal grandmother, as neither parent is involved in his care. Grandmother has hypertension and chronic lung disease. The father has drug dependency and is in and out of rehabilitation and jail. The grandmother does not know where the mother of the child is and does not know her health history.Current Status\n--------------\n\n【8】Over the last 2 days, the patient has been noted to be awake more at night than during the day. Today, his behavior has ranged from being intermittently quiet and non‐interactive to agitated, crying, and fearful of a “man” he is seeing in the corner of his room. He will occasionally correctly state his name and where he is, but then reverts back to being confused and unable to identify family members or his current location.

What is the pathophysiology of delirium and what factors can predispose a patient to develop this problem?\n2.  What factors contribute to the development of delirium?\n3.  What are the different types of delirium and what are the available screening tools?\n4.  What are the best ways to optimize therapy: environmental or pharmacologic?Rationale and Evidence‐based Practice Explanation\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】### What is the pathophysiology of delirium and what factors can predispose a patient to develop this problem?\n\n【12】Delirium is best described as an acute brain dysfunction or a disruption in cerebral homeostasis with significant effects on patient outcomes, medical costs, morbidity, and mortality. Although delirium is multifactorial, some medications, such as benzodiazepines, glucocorticoids, anesthetics, diuretics, opiates, and antihistamines, are thought to potentiate its development 删除10：<u>(Patel et al . 2017 )</u>. Children under the age of 2 years and those with developmental delay, high severity of illness, low albumin, mechanical ventilation, and preexisting medical condition(s) are predisposed to the development of delirium 删除10：<u>(Patel et al . 2017 )</u>. There are three hypotheses for the development of pediatric delirium as discussed by Patel et al . 通用删除7(英):<u>( 2017 )</u>; neuro‐inflammatory, neurotransmitter, and oxidative stress. According to the neuro‐inflammatory hypothesis, systemic inflammation, such as that seen in critical illness, “leads to either compromise in the integrity of the blood–brain barrier or de novo production of inflammatory products within the brain.” The neurotransmitter hypothesis relates to use of medications that change neurotransmitter function and the oxidative stress hypothesis “suggests that reduced oxygen delivery in critical illness, coupled with increased cerebral metabolism, leads to the production of reactive oxygen species that cause global CNS dysfunction.” It is important to note that hypoxia has been clearly associated with delirium development.\n\n【13】### What factors contribute to the development of delirium?\n\n【14】Factors contributing to the development of pediatric delirium in critically ill children can be separated into three categories: predisposing, precipitating, and perpetuating 删除10：<u>(Malas et al . 2017 )</u>. Predisposing risk factors cannot be modified and include age less than 2, developmental delay, high severity of illness, low albumin, genetic susceptibility, mechanical ventilation, and preexisting medical conditions. Precipitating factors are treatment related and can potentially be modified for the patient, such as anticholinergic medications, benzodiazepines, cardiac bypass surgery, immobilization, prolonged length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU), and restraints. Perpetuating factors are found in the patient’s care environment, including lack of mobility, disruption of sleep–wake cycle, and lack of familiar environment and supports 删除10：<u>(Malas et al . 2017 )</u>.\n\n【15】Sedatives may also contribute to the development of delirium in critically ill pediatric patients. A possible replacement therapy is the use of dexmetomidine which has been noted to prevent and/or treat delirium; however, it is not currently FDA approved for the treatment of pediatric delirium. Identification and treatment of iatrogenic withdrawal syndrome (IWS) is also very important. Once IWS has been managed, if the patient continues to experience symptoms of delirium, environmental modifications may be needed as increasing sedative medications may actually end up prolonging delirium 删除10：<u>(Patel et al . 2017 )</u>.\n\n【16】### What are the different types of delirium and what are the available screening tools?\n\n【17】The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders recognizes three types of delirium: hypoactive, hyperactive, and mixed type 删除10：<u>(Patel et al . 2017 )</u>. Typical symptoms of hypoactive delirium include lethargy, inattentiveness, and decreased responsiveness. Hyperactive delirium is characterized by agitation, restlessness, hypervigilance, and combative behavior. Mixed‐type delirium is characterized by a combination of both hypoactive and hyperactive symptoms. Hypoactive delirium has been associated with poor prognosis and occurs at the greatest frequency. Emotional lability as well as visual and auditory hallucinations can also be experienced by pediatric patients with delirium along with disordered sleep. Delirium most often occurs early in the ICU course of children, with median time of onset 1–3 days and typically lasting about 2 days. About one‐third of pediatric patients who develop delirium early in their hospital course will experience recurrent episodes during their ICU stay. Children with mild to severe delirium can experience longer time on mechanical ventilation, longer hospital length of stay, longer time to emerge from sedation, longer time to extubation, and higher resource utilization 删除10：<u>(Patel et al . 2017 )</u>. Delirium is often a temporary condition, although it has been strongly linked with poor outcomes, including increase in mortality and enduring cognitive impairment in survivors 删除10：<u>(Patel et al . 2017 )</u>. In 2013, the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) released guidelines recommending that screening for delirium become a standard of care in adults, but there are not guidelines specific to pediatrics at this time.\n\n【18】Current assessment of delirium includes two versions of validated pediatric delirium screens: the Pediatric Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU with two versions, the pCAM‐ICU for children older than age 5 years and the psCAM‐ICU for those aged 6 months to 5 years. The other option is the CAPD, which is an observation screen useful for patients aged 0–21; it can provide a picture of a pediatric patient over a period of time and has been validated in both developmentally normal and developmentally delayed children 删除10：<u>(Patel et al . 2017 )</u>. Prior to assessing a child for delirium, their level of consciousness should be assessed using a tool such as the RASS 删除10：<u>(Smith et al . 2013 )</u>. Routine monitoring of critically ill children should occur at least once per shift. The challenge is providing the most minimal sedation required to keep patients comfortable, especially those requiring mechanical ventilation or other invasive treatments, along with assessment and treatment for delirium.\n\n【19】### What are the best ways to optimize therapy: environmental or pharmacologic?\n\n【20】When delirium is diagnosed in a critically ill child, the key to effective treatment is to identify the underlying cause 删除10：<u>(Patel et al . 2017 )</u>. Delirium is most often caused by a combination of factors, including the ICU environment, iatrogenic effects of treatment, and an effect of the underlying illness. Assessment for infection, treating hypoxemia, optimizing pain management, and correcting any metabolic abnormalities are some recommendations. Iatrogenic factors should be determined, followed by environmental modifications to help improve symptoms; alternatively, pharmacologic treatment may be needed.\n\n【21】Modifications of the child’s environment can help in decreasing the risk of delirium as well as aiding in alleviating symptoms. This can include adjusting the room temperature and lighting to reflect day and night time, reducing noise, and decreasing the use of physical restraints (when safe). Objects and individuals familiar to the child should be close by. Consistent caregivers along with stable daily routines can also reduce the risk of confusion and help regulate the sleep–wake cycle. Reorientation strategies have been shown to produce a statistically significant decrease in symptoms. It is important to address both sensory and communication limitations when able. Early mobilization can reduce delirium risk and improve time to improvement 删除10：<u>(Malas et al . 2017 )</u>.\n\n【22】If physical and environmental adjustments have not been successful, a trial of pharmacologic therapy can begin. Atypical antipsychotics are recommended because of their precognitive effects and favorable side‐effect profile 删除10：<u>(Patel et al . 2017 )</u>, but this use is off‐label at this time. Haloperidol has been used clinically for many years to manage delirium symptoms, but also comes with side effects 删除10：<u>(Turkel, 2017 )</u>. When managing pediatric delirium with atypical antipsychotics, quetiapine, risperidone, and olanzapine are currently the usual first choices. As mentioned previously, dexmetomidine can also be used. The ability to discontinue pharmacologic therapy should be discussed no later than 5–7 days after initiation 删除10：<u>(Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, 2019 )</u>.\n\n【23】Prevention of delirium should be the first goal of ICU care, followed by astute evaluation. The risk of developing delirium in the ICU environment is high, so early evaluation and intervention can assist in management. With improved awareness of pediatric delirium and its adverse effects, implementation of improved sedation techniques, early mobilization, and involvement of family members in daily care, delirium may be able to be prevented in critically ill children.Case Resolution\n---------------\n\n【24】The patient scored 17 on the delirium scale, which indicates the presence of delirium. His nurses scheduled a daily routine and family brought some familiar objects from home. Nursing was also encouraged to cluster care at night for fewer disturbances. The child initially had improvement in his symptoms, but he continued to have moments of confusion and hallucinations. He was thus started on an antipsychotic medication to help allay delirium symptoms. Within a week of starting the medication, his symptoms completely resolved and the patient returned to his neurologic baseline.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 13:55:52", "endTime": "2024/09/12 13:56:25", "cost": 33.194}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:27", "update_time": "2024-09-11 21:56:26", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 21:55:52"}

He reports a productive cough with yellowish-brown sputum every morning throughout the year. He is sitting in a characteristic “tripod” position to facilitate use of accessory muscles of respiration. He appears to have airway obstruction with respiratory distress, with lower chest retractions, and bilateral wheezes and rhonchi. His perioral cyanosis suggests hypoxemia. The anteroposterior diameter of the chest wall appears increased, suggesting hyperinflation. Cardiovascular examination reveals distant heart sounds but no signs of significant cardiac disease.\n\n【9】 Most likely diagnosis: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation\n\n【10】 Next diagnostic step: Arterial blood gas to assess oxygenation and acid-base status\n\n【11】 Best initial treatment: Oxygen by nasal cannula, followed closely by bronchodilators, and steroids for inflammatory component\n\n【12】#### ANALYSIS\n\n【13】##### Objectives\n\n【14】1\\. Know the definition and etiologies of chronic bronchitis, COPD, and emphysema.\n\n【15】2\\. Be familiar with spirometry and flow-volume loops for diagnosis of obstructive and restrictive lung diseases.\n\n【16】3\\. Be familiar with the treatment of chronic stable COPD, as well as management of acute exacerbations, including the indications for ventilatory assistance.\n\n【17】##### Considerations\n\n【18】This 58-year-old long-time smoker likely has chronic obstructive lung disease. He is now in respiratory distress with labored respirations, cyanosis, and wheezing. The urgent issue is his current respiratory status. Rapid clinical assessment is critical in case this patient is headed toward respiratory failure, perhaps necessitating intubation and mechanical ventilation. An arterial blood gas will quickly provide information regarding the adequacy of oxygenation status (PaO <sub>2 </sub> ) and ventilation (PaCO <sub>2 </sub> ).\n\n【19】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【20】#### Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease\n\n【21】#### DEFINITIONS\n\n【22】CHRONIC BRONCHITIS: Clinical diagnosis characterized by excessive secretion of bronchial mucus and productive cough for 3 months or more in at least 2 consecutive years in the absence of any other disease that might account for this symptom.\n\n【23】CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD): Chronic airflow obstruction caused by chronic bronchitis or emphysema. Usually is progressive, may be accompanied by airway hyperreactivity, and may be partially reversible. Typically the forced expiratory volume in first second of expiration (FEV <sub>1 </sub> ) will be less than 80% of expected, and some use a staging system of FEV <sub>1 </sub> /FVC (forced vital capacity): <0.7 (mild), 0.3 to 0.5 (moderate), and <0.3 (severe).\n\n【24】EMPHYSEMA: Pathologic diagnosis that denotes abnormal, permanent enlargement of air spaces distal to the terminal bronchiole, with destruction of their walls and without obvious fibrosis.\n\n【25】SPIROMETRY: Method of evaluating respiratory flow volumes and flow rates to assess pulmonary function.\n\n【26】FORCED VITAL CAPACITY (FVC): Total volume of air expired after full inspiration. FVC is reduced in restrictive lung disease. Patients with obstructive lung disease usually have normal FVC.\n\n【27】FEV <sub>1 </sub> : Volume of air expired in the first second during maximal expiratory effort. FEV <sub>1 </sub> is reduced in both obstructive lung disease (increased airway resistance) and restrictive lung disease (low vital capacity).\n\n【28】FEV <sub>1 </sub> /FVC: Percentage of the vital capacity that is expired during the first second of maximal effort, reduced in obstructive lung disease.\n\n【29】RESTRICTIVE LUNG DISEASE: Chronic pulmonary disorders characterized by low lung volumes because of alterations of either the lung parenchyma (intrinsic), or chest wall, pleura, or respiratory muscles (extrinsic). Typically the FVC and FEV <sub>1 </sub> are reduced, but the FEV <sub>1 </sub> /FVC is normal. The diagnosis is best made by a reduced total lung capacity (TLC).\n\n【30】#### CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【31】The most common etiology for COPD is inhalation injury, specifically cigarette smoking. Another important cause is α <sub>1 </sub> \\-antitrypsin deficiency , which is hereditary. Pulmonary disease may become evident by age 40 years and often occurs without cough or smoking history. Therapy by replacement of α <sub>1 </sub> \\-antitrypsin enzyme is available. Characteristically, patients with COPD present with progressively worsening dyspnea (first on exertion, then with activity, then at rest). Patient may vary in appearance from a “blue bloater” (chronic bronchitis, overweight, edematous, cyanotic) to a “pink puffer” (emphysema, thin, ruddy cheeks).\n\n【32】Arterial blood gases (ABG) often are normal in the early phase of the disease; however, in more advanced disease, there is evidence of hypoxemia and hypercapnia, often with a chronic compensated respiratory acidosis as a consequence of CO <sub>2 </sub> retention. Such chronic stable patients may have a Pao <sub>2 </sub> near 50 mm Hg and a Paco <sub>2 </sub> near 50 mm Hg, but a near-normal pH (the “50-50” club). During an acute exacerbation, more severe hypoxemia or hypercapnia, or respiratory acidosis noted on ABG may be an indication of impending respiratory failure and need for ventilatory support.\n\n【33】Spirometry is the most basic, inexpensive, widely valuable pulmonary function test to diagnose pulmonary diseases . Spirometric tracings of forced expiration  and flow-volume loops  help to identify the type of lung disease (obstructive vs restrictive), as well as potential reversibility of airflow obstruction. Restrictive lung diseases tend to have lower lung volumes (decreased TLC and VC \\[vital capacity\\]), whereas obstructive diseases have larger lung volumes (TLC normal or increased) with decreased expiratory flow rates (reduced FEV <sub>1 </sub> to <80% expected, and FEV <sub>1 </sub> /FVC <0.7) . Specific parameters help to classify the type and degree of lung dysfunction . Reduced FEV <sub>1 </sub> /FVC with minimal response to bronchodilators is the hallmark of COPD.\n删除3：<u>Figure 34–1.

Bronchodilators (beta-agonist and anticholinergic agents) are administered via handheld nebulizers; high-dose systemic glucocorticoids accelerate the rate of improvement in lung function among these patients; antibiotics should be given if there is suspicion of a respiratory infection. Controlled oxygen administration with nasal oxygen at low flows or oxygen with Venturi masks will correct hypoxemia without causing severe hypercapnia. Caution must be exercised in patients with chronic respiratory insufficiency whose respiratory drive is dependent on “relative hypoxemia”; these individuals may become apneic if excessive oxygen is administered.\n\n【35】Positive-pressure mask ventilation, such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or biphasic positive airway pressure (BiPAP), offers an alternative to intubation and mechanical ventilation in the treatment of cooperative patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD and severe hypercapnia. Signs of acute respiratory failure include tachypnea (respiratory rate >40 breaths per minute), inability to speak because of dyspnea, accessory muscle use with fatigue despite maximal therapy, confusion, restlessness, agitation, lethargy, a rising PaCO <sub>2 </sub> level, and extreme hypoxemia . Acute respiratory failure is generally treated with endotracheal intubation with ventilatory support to correct the gas-exchange disorders. Complications of mechanical ventilation include difficulty in extubation, ventilator-associated pneumonia, pneumothorax, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n【36】Long-term complications of COPD from hypoxemia can cause pulmonary hypertension, secondary erythrocytosis, exercise limitation, and impaired mental functioning. For patients with COPD who are stable, only smoking cessation, supplemental oxygen therapy for patients with chronic hypoxemia, and lung volume reduction surgery in selected patients have been shown to alter the natural history of the disease, and provide any reduction in mortality . Patients with a resting hypoxemia (PaO <sub>2 </sub> <55 mm Hg or SaO <sub>2 </sub> <88%) generally benefit from home oxygen therapy, which must be utilized at least 18 h/d. Other therapies such as inhaled bronchodilators (beta-agonists and/or anticholinergics) or inhaled glucocorticoids are used for symptomatic relief and to try to reduce the frequency of exacerbations.\n\n【37】###", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 11:47:28", "endTime": "2024/09/12 11:48:03", "cost": 35.068}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:27", "update_time": "2024-09-11 19:48:03", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 19:47:27"}

She has feelings of guilt about having such thoughts and believes  删除换行 that she is not a good mother. The baby was born at full term via a normal vaginal delivery. \n\n【3】The labour lasted 18 hours and there were no other complications. She reported feeling low  删除换行 and tearful during the first week post-partum but said that her mood improved within a few  删除换行 days. However, over the past 6 weeks, she describes feeling low and tired all the time. She  删除换行 complains of low energy levels, poor concentration and does not enjoy looking after her son  删除换行 as much as she did in the past.

She had been prescribed fluoxetine  删除换行 20 mg once a day. She took the medication for a year and then stopped the medication as she  删除换行 felt better. There is no other psychiatric or medical history. Her parents are retired and live in  删除换行 a different city.

She lives with her husband who is an  删除换行 engineer. She describes herself as a perfectionist who likes doing things in a particular way. \n\n【6】She is a non-smoker and a social drinker.\n\n【7】Mental state examination\n\n【8】This woman is seen by her GP at home. She is dressed in her night clothes, has greasy hair  删除换行 and has not taken a shower. She is holding the baby appropriately but does not smile or make  删除换行 eye contact with the baby. During the interview she bottle feeds the baby. She has discontin删除8：<u>￾</u>ued breastfeeding due to mastitis. She feels that she has let her baby down by not being able  删除换行 to breastfeed. She speaks in a monotonous voice and becomes tearful when asked how she  删除换行 is coping. She has feelings of guilt about not being a good mother. She says that she has had  删除换行 thoughts that it would be better if the baby was dead. On one occasion an image of her putting  删除换行 a pillow over the baby’s face flashed through her mind, although she says she would never do  删除换行 this. She finds these thoughts distressing. She has thoughts of wanting to be dead but does  删除换行 not have any definite suicidal plans. Cognitive examination did not reveal any impairment.\n\n【9】Questions\n\n【10】• What is the differential diagnosis?\n\n【11】• How would you manage this patient?删除5：<u>146</u>\n删除7：<u>100 Cases in Psychiatry</u>\nANSWER 53\n\n【12】This woman is suffering from postnatal depression, which is defined as depression occur删除8：<u>￾</u>ring after childbirth. It is seen most often within 4 weeks of childbirth but can occur up to  删除换行 6 months post-partum. The symptoms of postnatal depression are similar to those seen in  删除换行 a depressive disorder. She has all the core symptoms of depression including low mood, low  删除换行 energy levels and anhedonia. These symptoms have been present for more than 2 weeks. She  删除换行 also has additional symptoms of depression such as feelings of guilt, loss of confidence, poor  删除换行 sleep and suicidal thoughts. She has had an episode of depression in the past and therefore  删除换行 fulfils the criteria for a recurrent depressive disorder, with the current episode being moder删除8：<u>￾</u>ate to severe. The prevalence rate of postnatal depression is between 8% and 20%. Many such  删除换行 women have had depression in the past. It is important to screen for depression in pregnancy  删除换行 and health visitors can use the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) as a part of  删除换行 antenatal check-up.\n\n【13】Management\n\n【14】This woman needs to be referred to a specialist Mother and Baby (Perinatal Psychiatric) team  删除换行 for urgent assessment of the risk of harm to the baby and risk of self-harm, which dictates the  删除换行 course of further management. One option, depending on risk and choice, is admission to the \n\n【15】Mother and Baby Unit for further assessment and management. There are several benefits of  删除换行 admitting mother and baby together. It lets the mother continue to breastfeed, allows for healthy  删除换行 development of attachment and maintains the confidence of the mother in her parenting abil删除8：<u>￾</u>ity. Parenting assessment allows early detection of problems with attachment and institution of  删除换行 remedial measures. Treatment for the depression includes cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT)  删除换行 and/or pharmacotherapy. Lofepramine, fluoxetine and sertraline, although expressed in breast  删除换行 milk, are considered relatively safe, unlike medications such as lithium and sodium valproate  删除换行 which should not be used in breastfeeding mothers. If the parenting assessment raises concerns  删除换行 about the safety of the child (risk of harm or neglect), then a referral to the child safeguarding  删除换行 team should be made. Occasionally involuntary detention under the local Mental Health Act  删除换行 may be warranted especially if there is high risk and little insight from the mother.\n\n【16】Differential diagnosis\n\n【17】• Post-partum blues is seen in up to 75% of women and is characterized by a mild self删除8：<u>￾</u>limiting episode of mood disturbance lasting a few days. It usually begins 3–10 days  删除换行 post-partum (peak onset days 5–7) and resolves spontaneously.\n\n【18】• Post-partum psychosis is seen in 1% of women and is characterized by rapid onset  删除换行 of labile mood, thought disorder, confusion and disorientation. Previous history and  删除换行 family history of mental illness, particularly of bipolar disorder, are significant risk  删除换行 factors. This is a severe disorder and often requires inpatient treatment.

He states he has had this rash for almost 3 years. He has tried various topical corticosteroids including clobetasol, betamethasone diproprionate, fluocinonide, and triamcinolone without any improvement. He has also tried lidocaine and capsaicin creams without any relief of itching. Past medical history is significant for chronic hepatitis C and cirrhosis of the liver. On examination, he has numerous firm, round, excoriated nodules covering 50% of the trunk and extremities. Laboratory testing for pruritus is negative. He is diagnosed with generalized prurigo nodularis. Due to his co-morbid medical conditions, internal medications should be avoided. After discussion, the patient is started on BB-UVB.\n\n【8】Discussion\n----------\n\n【9】A debilitating disease characterized by hard, intensely pruritic nodules most commonly on the extensor surfaces of the extremities, prurigo nodularis (PN) was first noted to be responsive to large doses of X-rays in 1924 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Almost a century later, little remains known regarding the etiology and pathophysiology, and given relatively low prevalence, no large randomized-control studies have been done to evaluate the various treatment options used today. Therapies such as superpotent topical corticosteroids, intralesional corticosteroids, topical vitamin D analogs, topical capsaicin, antihistamines, and phototherapy are generally accepted treatment options 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Systemic medications such as thalidomide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, methotrexate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>, and cyclosporine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> have also been shown to be effective in a small number of studies.\n\n【10】When PN is generalized, the disadvantage to topical therapies is that it can be impractical and there may be noncompliance given the inconvenience of frequent application of medications to scattered lesions over a large affected body surface area . Systemic agents have various potential internal side effects and the need for frequent laboratory monitoring and the presence of comorbid medical conditions limit their use.\n删除3：<u>Figure 26.1\n\n【11】Generalized prurigo nodularis that is not amenable to topical therapies and is a good candidate for phototherapy\n</u>\nAlthough large-scale, randomized controlled trials are lacking, phototherapy is a treatment option that can be both safe and efficacious, especially for generalized PN. Phototherapy is thought to work in the treatment of PN by decreasing the number of epidermal and dermal nerve fibers related to the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), which contribute to chronic itch 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. CGRP and nerve growth factor (NGF) are associated with neural hyperplasia and neurogenic inflammation, which may explain the underlying pathophysiology of PN 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】There are only a few small studies available on each of the phototherapy modalities used for the treatment of PN, including PUVA, BB-UVB, NB-UVB, excimer laser, and UVA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. All studies show that phototherapy is overall effective in the majority of patients with PN yielding partial, if not complete improvement in appearance of lesions and symptoms of pruritus. There is no clear evidence that one phototherapy modality is superior to another, as none of these had active comparators. Because UVA penetrates deep into the skin, it may be assumed that UVA is more efficacious than UVB in treating PN; however, according to the limited data available so far, UVB and UVA appear to have similar clinical outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Excimer laser does have an additional benefit given its ability to focus on specific resistant nodules. Importantly, various combination therapies including BB-UVB and PUVA, bath PUVA and excimer, excimer and potent topical steroid, and Goeckerman therapy (BB-UVB, coal tar, and topical steroid) appear safe and effective. Alone and in combination therapies, the only reported adverse events are erythema and pruritus.\n\n【13】For this patient with generalized PN recalcitrant to topical therapies, phototherapy should be considered alone or in combination as mentioned above. For example, phototherapy can be used to treat the entirety of involved areas followed by spot-treatment of stubborn lesions with superpotent topical or intralesional corticosteroids. Excimer laser can also be used as a focused treatment modality. Given difficulty in applying topical therapies to all involved body surfaces, this combination approach using phototherapy as generalized therapy and topical medication to more localized, resistant areas may also encourage patient compliance.\n\n【14】At the UCSF Phototherapy Unit, patients with PN are usually treated with BB-UVB rather than NB-UVB or PUVA. This is based on the authors’ experience that overall, patients respond better and tolerate BB-UVB better than NB-UVB or PUVA. BB-UVB, NB-UVB, and PUVA are all initiated and increased per protocol as outlined in Chaps. 1 and 2 .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 11:32:11", "endTime": "2024/09/12 11:34:09", "cost": 118.52}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:27", "update_time": "2024-09-11 19:34:09", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 19:32:10"}

Elevated TSH levels and normal T <sub>4 </sub> /T <sub>3</sub>\n\n【4】D. Low TSH and elevated T <sub>4 </sub> /T <sub>3 </sub> levels\n\n【5】Answer: 15.1 D . Most cases of hyperthyroidism will result in a suppressed level of TSH and elevated T <sub>4 </sub> /T <sub>3 </sub> levels. An exception to this would be a secondary hyperthyroid state, such as with a pituitary tumor that secretes TSH, resulting in both a high TSH level and high serum hormone levels (caused by overstimulation of the thyroid gland).\n\n【6】Question: 15.2 A 35-year-old woman presents with increasing fatigue for several months. She has also gained 10 lb, despite a decrease in her appetite. Her past medical history is significant for Graves disease, which was treated with radioactive iodine. Laboratory studies confirm that TSH is elevated. Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient?\n\n【7】A. Propylthiouracil (PTU)\n\n【8】B. β-blockers\n\n【9】C. Levothyroxine\n\n【10】D. Thyroidectomy\n\n【11】Answer: 15.2 C . This patient most likely has hypothyroidism due to the prior radioactive iodine therapy for ablation of the thyroid gland. Most cases of hypothyroidism are treated with thyroxine given orally.

His mother noted about seven infections over the past 8 months, all treated with antibiotics. After discussing treatment options with the family, the ENT specialist recommended a tonsillectomy. The patient’s tonsillectomy was complicated by bleeding from the surgical bed, and he had temporary loss of taste sensation from his posterior tongue. He is currently doing well and without complaints.\n\n【3】 The intraoperative bleeding was most likely from which blood vessel?\n\n【4】 Why was there a temporary loss of taste sensation?\n\n【5】### ANSWER TO CASE 49 :\n\n【6】#### Recurrent Tonsillitis\n\n【7】Summary: A 7-year-old boy is status posttonsillectomy for recurrent tonsillitis complicated by increased intraoperative bleeding and temporary loss of taste sensation from the posterior one-third of the tongue.\n\n【8】• Vessel involved with intraoperative bleeding: External palatine vein\n\n【9】• Loss of taste sensation: Compression of glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX)\n\n【10】### CLINICAL CORRELATION\n\n【11】For patients with recurrent episodes of tonsillitis or peritonsillar abscesses (>4 episodes per year), tonsillectomy may be indicated. Although tonsillectomy is regarded as a routine procedure, it is not without complications and risks. A thorough understanding of the anatomy of the pharynx is necessary in order to limit complications. The tonsillar bed is extremely vascular with the most common source of intraoperative bleeding from the external palatine vein, which arises from the lateral aspect of the tonsillar bed. Even if a direct injury does not occur, compression from edema may cause temporary injury as in this case. Compression of glossopharyngeal nerve branches causes a temporary loss in taste sensation on the posterior aspect of the tongue. As the swelling decreases, so does the nerve impairment. Many other vital vessels, nerves, and structures are adjacent to the tonsils, and care must be taken to avoid injury.\n\n【12】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【13】#### The Tonsils\n\n【14】### OBJECTIVES\n\n【15】1\\.

Be able to identify vessels that supply the pharynx, especially branches that course through the tonsillar beds\n\n【19】5\\. Be able to identify the cranial nerves providing sensory and motor innervation to the pharynx\n\n【20】### DISCUSSION\n\n【21】The pharynx is a space within the head that connects the oral and nasal cavities to the trachea and esophagus . Air-filled spaces in the temporal bone (i.e. the tympanic cavity and the mastoid air cells) connect with the pharynx through the pharyngotympanic (eustachian) tube. The walls of the pharynx are covered with mucosa. Deep to the mucosa are several aggregations of lymphoid tissue that form a ring around the pharynx, priming the immune system for defense against pathogens .\n删除3：<u>Figure 49-1. Median section through pharynx.</u>\n\n【22】The superior boundary of the pharynx is the base of the skull. The muscles of the pharyngeal walls form a cone that narrows to the esophagus. The medial pterygoid plates support the lateral walls of the superior part of the pharynx. The bodies of cervical vertebrae support the posterior wall. The anterior wall is interrupted by three apertures. One opens to the nasal cavity, another to the oral cavity, and a third to the larynx. Therefore, the pharynx is divided into three corresponding regions: the nasopharynx , the oropharynx , and the laryngopharynx. The naso- and oropharynx are continuous but are separated by elevation of the soft palate during swallowing to prevent reflux of food and liquid into the nasopharynx. The oro- and laryngopharynx are also continuous. Depression of the epiglottis during swallowing separates the larynx from the laryngopharynx, preventing aspiration into the trachea and lungs.\n\n【23】The pharyngeal wall is composed of three muscles: the superior, middle, and inferior pharyngeal constrictors. The inferior part of the inferior constrictor muscle thickens as it merges with the esophagus, forming a sphincter called the cricopharyngeus muscle. The three constrictor muscles are stacked like ice cream cones. Between the pairs of muscles are gaps that transmit important structures. The gap between the superior constrictor and the occipital bone transmits the pharyngotympanic tube, the levator veli palatini muscle , and the ascending palatine artery. Between the superior and middle constrictors are the glossopharyngeal nerve and stylopharyngeus muscle. Between the middle and inferior constrictors course the internal laryngeal nerve and the superior laryngeal artery. The recurrent laryngeal nerve and the inferior laryngeal artery ascend deep to the inferior constrictor.\n\n【24】The lymphoid tissue surrounding the pharynx is commonly called the Waldeyer ring , which is composed of three masses of lymphoid tissue: the pharyngeal tonsils (also called “adenoids” when enlarged), the palatine tonsils , and the lingual tonsils. The pharyngeal tonsils are located in the roof and posterior wall of the nasopharynx. The opening of the pharyngotympanic tube into the nasopharynx is protected by a tonsil. The palatine tonsils are located in the anterior wall of the oropharynx between the palatoglossal and palatopharyngeal folds . The lingual tonsil is located under the mucosa of the posterior one-third of the tongue.\n\n【25】The pharynx is supplied by arteries from several sources, most of which are branches of the external carotid artery, specifically the maxillary, facial, lingual, and superior thyroid arteries. The constrictor muscles are also supplied by branches from the deep cervical and inferior thyroid arteries. With respect to this case, the most important vessels are the ascending palatine and tonsillar branches of the facial artery. Surgery to remove the palatine tonsil can damage the tonsillar branch, resulting in excessive bleeding. Venous drainage from the pharynx parallels the arterial supply. In addition, there is an extensive pharyngeal venous plexus on the posterior surface of the constrictor muscles. The external palatine vein descends along the lateral surface of the palatine tonsil to drain into the venous plexus. Therefore, this vessel may be damaged during surgery to remove a palatine tonsil, also resulting in excessive bleeding.\n\n【26】The nerve supply to the pharynx is from cranial nerves IX and X. The glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) supplies general sensory fibers to the mucosa of the pharynx. These fibers contribute to the afferent limb of the gag reflex. CN IX also supplies special sensory fibers mediating taste to the posterior one-third of the tongue. This nerve exits the cranium through the jugular foramen and descends with the stylopharyngeus muscle to pass through the gap between the superior and middle pharyngeal constrictor muscles. The vagus nerve (CN X) supplies general motor fibers to the constrictor muscles. These fibers contribute to the efferent limb of the gag reflex. This nerve also exits the cranium through the jugular foramen but descends within the carotid sheath. As it descends, it gives off branches that form the pharyngeal plexus on the posterior surface of the pharynx. In this case, edema from the tonsillectomy compressed the branches of CN IX, blocking the sensation of taste from the posterior one-third of the tongue.\n\n【27】###", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 11:35:59", "endTime": "2024/09/12 11:36:10", "cost": 11.006}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:27", "update_time": "2024-09-11 19:36:10", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 19:35:59"}

A patient is brought in by ambulance and the paramedics state: “Got no pulse.” In which of the following clinical scenarios would it be appropriate to withhold CPR?\n\n【1】A.

A 19-year-old man brought out of a burning building with no movement and no spontaneous respirations.\n\n【5】Answer: 26.1 C. Withholding CPR is generally performed in compliance with an advance directive, obvious signs of irreversible death, and with clear physiologic futility (which often takes time to evaluate completely). The 46-year-old woman with breast cancer and an advance directive is the most appropriate patient to withhold CPR, even though the daughter is insisting that everything be done. The patient’s wishes generally take priority over family members’ instructions. The other scenarios describe situations of potentially reversible brain dysfunction. Drowning victims may be successfully resuscitated even after being submerged for 30 minutes and sometimes even longer. A patient with possible heroin overdose may outwardly show absence of brain function, but may gain function with resuscitation and opiate reversal. A patient who has been in a burning building can experience smoke inhalation or carbon monoxide poisoning, but he or she should be resuscitated before a conclusion is drawn about possible brain death or physiologic futility.\n\n【6】Question: 26.2 An 82-year-old woman with colon cancer and liver metastases was admitted for chemotherapy.

Sharing this decision with family members is rarely helpful because guilt is often a complicating factor.\n\n【10】D. Discuss with the patient that a DNR order will not mean she will receive less care.\nAnswer: 26.2 D. This patient is elderly and has metastatic cancer. Out-of-hospital survival would not be expected should this patient require CPR. Thus, CPR for MW could be described as being a futile effort. The patient does not meet other criteria for futility. It is important that she is of sound mind. A DNR order should not be written even if CPR would be judged to be futile unless the patient or family members concur. Patients must be given time to understand the seriousness of their diagnosis. Periodically readdressing the question of CPR with patients and their family should be done on a continual basis. This is best performed in the context of other medical decisions that occur during patient care. The health care professional should emphasize that a DNR order does not mean that the patient will be abandoned or receive a lower standard of care.\n\n【11】KEY POINTS\n\n【12】 Brain death is defined as the irreversible loss of brain function, including brain stem function, and is different from brain injury.\n\n【13】 Brain death is a clinical diagnosis and depends on the absence of spontaneous movement, brain stem function, and apnea.\n\n【14】 CPR can be withheld due to a valid advanced directive or when there is clear evidence of irreversible death (rigor mortis).\n\n【15】 Discussions about organ donation should be approached with sensitivity and only after dealing with the questions about brain death.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 11:37:07", "endTime": "2024/09/12 11:41:34", "cost": 267.479}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:27", "update_time": "2024-09-11 19:41:34", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 19:37:06"}

Other causes of third-trimester painful bleeding include labor， genital laceration， and uterine rupture(typically seen during labor in women who attempt vaginal delivery after cesarean section).\n\n【9】What is the pathophysiology of this condition?\n\n【10】Abruptio placentae is the premature separation of a normal placenta from the uterus occurring after20 weeks' gestation and before delivery. The rupture of maternal blood vessels at the anchoring villi of the placenta causes a separation from the endometrium in which blood can accumulate. The hemorrhage can be external or concealed (Figure13-1). This in turn disrupts the fetal blood supply and in severe cases can lead to fetal death.\n\n【11】MOOFEDHICMEHE\n\n【12】FIGURE 13-1. Layers in abruptio placentae. (Reproduced， with per-mission， from Cunningham FG， et al. Williams Obstetrics， 22nd ed. New York： McGraw-Hill， 2005： 812.\\]\n\n【13】What risk factors are associated with this condition?\n\n【14】Risk factors that can increase disruption or weakening of the maternal blood vessels include trauma， maternal hypertension， cigarette smoking， cocaine use， thrombophilia， increased parity， direct abdominal trauma， amniocentesis， and multifetal gestation.\n\n【15】What complication is the patient at greatly increased risk for developing?\n\n【16】Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) occurs in approximately 10%-20% of cases of serious abruption with fetal death. In these cases， it is thought that the death of the fetus releases procoagulants into the mother's circulation， triggering DIC. This initiates intravascular activation of coagulation and results in consumption of platelets and clotting factors. Fibrin may deposit in the microcirculation， causing ischemic organ damage and hemolytic anemia and then fibrinolysis of the fibrin deposition. Ultimately， this can cause a bleeding diathesis along with clinical manifestations of thrombosis.", "index": 2071, "show": true, "start": 2071, "end": 2075, "comment": "【12】FIGURE 13-1.

He has complete hypopituitarism including thyroid-stimulating hormone deficiency (TSHD), growth hormone deficiency (GHD), adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency (ACTHD), hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) due to gonadotropin and/or gonadotropin-releasing hormone deficiency, diabetes insipidus (DI), and hypothalamic obesity. He continues on hormonal replacement therapy, including levothyroxine , recombinant GH (rGH), hydrocortisone, desmopressin, and testosterone injections with variable dosing consistency. His final height of 64 inches is below his midparental target of 68 inches and his current BMI is 35 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> . He recently completed high school, with no current plans to enter college or obtain employment. He is living with his parents and prefers playing video games. Mother questions when he needs to transfer to an adult endocrinologist and whether rGH therapy should be stopped since he completed height growth.\n\n【13】Introduction\n------------\n\n【14】While the incidence of hypopituitarism among adults remains low at an estimated rate of 4.2/100,000 per year, certain pediatric conditions cause permanent hypopituitarism that require lifelong treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Although traumatic brain injury, peri-natal injury, post-infectious consequences, infiltrative disorders, hypophysitis, genetic mutations (such as HESX1 , POU1F1 , PROP1 , LHX3/4 , or SOX1 ), or congenital malformations (holoprosencephaly, optic nerve hypoplasia, pituitary stalk interruption, or ectopic pituitary gland) may all cause hypopituitarism, the most common cause of childhood-derived adult hypopituitarism is childhood cancer , comprising 65% of all causes of hypopituitarism among adolescents and young adults (AYA) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 – 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】The number of childhood cancer survivors (CCS) is increasing, as remission rates of all childhood cancer types improve 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Due to advanced treatment techniques, survival has improved but has increased morbidity and mortality from the late effects of cancer therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. Now, 1 in 750 adults in the United States is estimated to be a CCS, including nearly 76,000 young adults ages 20–30 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. Endocrine sequelae occur among 45–65% or more of all CCS , with brain tumor survivors at highest risk, typically requiring lifelong treatment and monitoring 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】AYAs with hypopituitarism are an increasing segment of the population from both improved cancer survivorship and survival following other insults or congenital defects. They require high-quality care long into adulthood; bridging the vulnerable time from childhood to adulthood becomes important, with providers facing unique management challenges that need to be considered. This population often experiences barriers to long-term care, including developmental and psychosocial barriers, access to care, and variable adoption of independence in medical care. How providers help patients navigate this transition will dictate their long-term success and outcomes.\n\n【17】Monitoring Considerations Among Adolescents and Young Adults with Hypopituitarism\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】In most cases, children may be diagnosed with pituitary abnormalities in early childhood prior to pubertal development. They often present with common symptoms of the pituitary defects involved, particularly short stature or failure to thrive (TSHD, GHD); fatigue (TSHD, GHD, ACTHD, DI); gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or constipation (TSHD, ACTHD); hair loss or dry skin (TSHD); lack of puberty (HH) or precocious puberty ; or polyuria with polydipsia (DI). Endocrine effects may follow a newly acquired pituitary injury, potentially presenting with neurologic symptoms of headache, vision loss, or seizures, such as following childhood cancer diagnosis or traumatic brain injury . In infancy, hypopituitarism symptoms include jaundice, hypoglycemia, or micropenis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 12 \\]</u>. Endocrinopathy patterns differ depending on the cause of hypopituitarism. For instance, genetic mutations causing hypopituitarism typically impact specific anterior pituitary deficiencies , while structural folding defects like holoprosencephaly associate with DI with or without anterior hypopituitarism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】Serial examinations and biochemical screening to assess endocrine function are recommended to detect early endocrinopathy diagnoses and begin timely therapy with hormonal replacement. As children grow, new deficiencies may present over time, particularly among children with anterior pituitary hypoplasia disorders and those who have had irradiation injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 7 \\]</u>. In those with pituitary hypoplasia syndromes such as optic nerve hypoplasia, most deficiencies will manifest by the time of puberty completion, at which time hypoplasia relative to total body size becomes stable, stagnating future risk of new endocrinopathies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In those with acute pituitary injury , such as following traumatic brain injury, usually onset of deficiencies is more immediate with most children recovering after 12 months while those with more severe injury continuing to develop new abnormalities up to 3 years after the insult 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Similar to those with congenital defects, future risk of new abnormalities would be more related to growth changes, with the reduction of risk upon height completion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. In contrast, CCS with acquired defects resulting from irradiation to the hypothalamus or pituitary may progress, requiring continued serial evaluation into adulthood.\n\n【20】AYAs with hypopituitarism should have height and weight monitored regularly with continued weight evaluation into adulthood. Following growth and pubertal completion, they require transition into adult follow-up screening and care. If the risk of an additional future pituitary defect is low, then follow-up testing should be dependent on the known abnormalities , with serial follow-up every 6 months. In addition, metabolic, bone, and reproductive health evaluations should occur into adulthood, when the impact of these effects is most likely to present .\nTable 5.1 删除换行 Screening practices for bone, reproductive, and metabolic health in adolescents and young adults\n\n| Category  | Clinical evaluation  | Screening testing  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Reproductive health  | Every visit evaluation: Male Frequency of erections Facial hair growth Libido Female Menstrual history Libido Symptoms: hot flashes, low concentration  | At risk populations: Yearly LH, FSH, and estradiol or testosterone Consider monitoring of AMH (female) Consider semen analysis (male)  |\n| Bone health  | Every visit evaluation: Fracture history, bone pain assessment, spine exam Yearly assessment of risk factors: Weight-bearing activity, nutritional content of calcium and vitamin D, and sunlight exposure  | Consider yearly vitamin D level Consider DXA as indicated  Consider lumbar/thoracic spine X-ray as indicated  |\n| Metabolic health  | Every visit assessment of blood pressure and BMI <20y, BMI percentile using CDC growth chart \\>20y, BMI adult definitions If BMI in overweight or obesity category: Assessment of hyperglycemia symptoms Assess exercise and nutritional factors  | Yearly evaluation (if at risk based on factors such as BMI category) Hgb A1c Fasting lipid profile Liver inflammation markers (ALT, AST, GGT)  |\n\n【22】FSH follicle-stimulating hormone, LH luteinizing hormone, AMH anti-Mullerian hormone, DXA dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, BMI body mass index, Hgb A1c hemoglobin A1c, ALT alanine aminotransferase, AST aspartate aminotransferase, GGT gamma-glutamyl transferase\n\n【23】Management Considerations Among Adolescents and Young Adults\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【24】Pediatric endocrinologists typically manage dose titration of hormonal replacements closely during pubertal progression, which may be considered the initiation of transition care to adulthood. During this time, optimization of rGH therapy and pubertal induction, along with dose adjustments necessary for all other hormones, are key to maximizing final adult height. During induction therapy of pubertal hormones, slow titration to adult doses occurs, until completion of growth, typically over a 2- to 3-year period . For females, this involves the use of low-dose estrogen, preferably transdermal 17β-estradiol, to reduce the risk of blood clots for those at risk, while allowing low initial doses and the subsequent addition of progesterone replacement near the time of menarche 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. For males with normal gonadal function, the use of either titrated testosterone replacement using intramuscular testosterone products most commonly or subcutaneous HCG replacement with or without recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) therapy allows for pubertal progression, with the latter sparing spermatogenesis and fertility potential 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 , 16 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】Upon reaching the final height, management considerations particular to AYAs with hypopituitarism occur, with alterations in treatment being required . Treatment is usually lifelong and requires monitoring per adult treatment doses and guidelines. While dosing of rGH during childhood and adolescence is higher when peak growth is occurring, lower doses are required in adulthood, with use focused on metabolic outcomes, completion of axial skeletal and muscular growth, and quality of life improvement . Doses following growth completion range between 0.4 and 1.0 mg daily, with lower requirements in older adulthood as physiologic GH production declines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. Adults with ACTHD continue cortisol replacement, managed in adolescence with hydrocortisone at doses near 6–10 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> /day, but AYAs may benefit more from use of longer-acting glucocorticoids such as prednisone, which increases dosing flexibility if adherence to treatment becomes a concern 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>.

The pituitary lesion was incidentally discovered on a recent MRI of the brain that was performed due to severe headaches several times a week (“15/10”in intensity). Her medical history was positive for polycystic ovarian syndrome diag-nosed 5 years ago (based on symptoms of weight gain and hirsutism)， newly diagnosed diabetes mel-litus type 2， mild hypertension， and anxiety.

The patient was advised that inferior petrosal sinus sampling (IPSS) was considered unnecessary and she should proceed with TSS. Following the TSS， immunohistochemistry of the pituitary tissue confirmed a corticotroph ade-noma； the tumor cells strongly expressed ACTH and chromogranin.\n\n【11】OUTCOME AND FOLLOW-UP\n\n【12】The serum cortisol concentration the morning after surgery was 4.8 mcg/dL， confirming an initial cure. The patient was discharged from the hospital on hydrocortisone 30 mg on waking and 20 mg at noon with a plan for taper. She developed severe glucocorti-coid withdrawal syndrome with arthralgias， myalgias， severe fatigue， exacerbation of anxiety， and new-onset 删除换行 depression. Her hydrocortisone taper was slowed down in response to her marked withdrawal symp-toms. She had a slow recovery of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenalI(HPA)axis、with serum cortisol concentrations as follows： 4.8 mcg/dL 3 months after surgery； 5.2 mcg/dL 1 year after surgery； 8 mcg/dL16 months after surgery； and 9.8 mcg/dL 19 months after surgery. At last follow-up she was taking 10 mg of hydrocortisone every morning. Cosyntropin testing is not needed to assess the recovery of the hypotha-lamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. At our institution， we simply check a morning serum cortisol concentra-tion before the morning dose of hydrocortisone， and thisasSsSsesses hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone production， pituitary ACTH secretion， and adrenal cortisol secretion.删除5：<u>3</u>\nIn this case， the patient presented with unrecognized and long-standingACTH-dependenthypercorti-solism due to a pituitary adenoma. Eventually， she was diagnosed with CS， but only following the inci-dental discovery of a pituitary adenoma. Until then， her symptoms were attributed to polycystic ovarian syndrome (including weight gain， hirsutism， and dia-betes mellitus type 2).

The time lag from symptom onset to the diagnosis of CS is likely due to nonspecific and mild symptoms that overlap with other conditions.删除5：<u>2</u>\nThe biochemical workup in our patient was consistent with ACTH-dependent hypercortisolism based on high-normal serum ACTH and dehydro-epiandrosterone sulfate concentrations abnormal l-mg overnight DST， and elevated 24-hour urinary free cortisol excretion. Notably， the late-night sali-vary cortisol concentration was not abnormal. In a systematic review and metaanalysis of diagnostic tests for CS， the sensitivity of late-night salivary cortisol concentration for the diagnosis of CS was95% and specificity was 90%.4 As no single test has100% accuracy for CS diagnosis， it is important to combine clinical suspicion of CS with several bio-chemical tests to confirm hypercortisolism.\n\n【14】Curative surgery for pituitary-dependent CS leads to adrenal insufficiency. Thus it is important to ensure that patients are initiated and educated on glucocorti-coid replacement therapy. Recovery of the HPA axis likely depends on the duration and degree of untreated hypercortisolism before curative surgery.6-8 Factors such as age， gender， BMI， subtypes of CS， duration of symptoms， clinical and biochemical severity， and post-operative glucocorticoid dose have been reported to affect the HPA axis recovery 3，6-8 Regular reassessment of the HPA axis should be performed in all patients with adrenal insufficiency following curative surgery for CS. Recovery of the HP axis takes months to years.3，6，8\n\n【15】Glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome (GWS) is a withdrawal reaction that occurs due to a decrease in supraphysiologic glucocorticoid concentrations. The mechanism of GWS is multifactorial and is mediated by the central noradrenergic and dopaminergic system， decrease in proopiomelanocortin-related peptides due to chronic suppression of the HPA axis， and rebound increase in cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6， tumor necrossiiss factor alpha， IL-1b， and prostaglandins， which occur with decreased glucocorticoid levels.9Patients often feel unwell with flu-like symptoms including anorexia， nausea， emesis， lethargy， somno-lence， arthralgia， myalgia， fever， and postural hypoten-sion. The symptoms and signs may be prolonged，and 删除换行 despite the glucocorticoid replacement， patients fail to immediately restore physical well-being and quality of life.10 Thus it is important to properly counsel patients about GWS before curative surgery.\n\n【16】Key Points\n\n【17】●The diagnosis of CS is usually delayed， sometimes for years， due to a mild and nonspecific presenta-tion. CS should be considered in any woman with symptoms of weight gain， hirsutism， and irregu-iar menses.\n\n【18】Both false-positive and false-negative results can occur in any tests for hypercortisolism， and thus the diagnosis of CS should be based on both clinical evaluation as well as a combination of biochemical tests.删除5：<u>4</u>\nMosstt women withmild-to-moderate eiACTH- dependent CS that is slow in onset will have pituitary-dependent disease.When1adefinite non-prolactin-secreting pituitary tumor is found on MRI in these patients， it is reasonable to con-sider proceeding directly to TSS.\n\n【19】●The periodic postoperative measurement of the morning serum cortisol concentration when the patient is on a single morning dosage of hydro-cortisone is a simple and inexpensive way to monitor the recovery of the HPA axis.\n\n【20】●Patients uniformly report that the glucocorticoid withdrawal symptoms following the cure of CS are worse than the CS itself.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "In this case， the patient presented with unrecognized and long-standingACTH-dependenthypercorti-solism due to a pituitary adenoma.

The patient was advised that inferior petrosal sinus sampling (IPSS) was considered unnecessary and she should proceed with TSS. Following the TSS， immunohistochemistry of the pituitary tissue confirmed a corticotroph ade-noma； the tumor cells strongly expressed ACTH and chromogranin.\n\n【11】OUTCOME AND FOLLOW-UP\n\n【12】The serum cortisol concentration the morning after surgery was 4.8 mcg/dL， confirming an initial cure. The patient was discharged from the hospital on hydrocortisone 30 mg on waking and 20 mg at noon with a plan for taper. She developed severe glucocorti-coid withdrawal syndrome with arthralgias， myalgias， severe fatigue， exacerbation of anxiety， and new-onset 删除换行 depression. Her hydrocortisone taper was slowed down in response to her marked withdrawal symp-toms. She had a slow recovery of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenalI(HPA)axis、with serum cortisol concentrations as follows： 4.8 mcg/dL 3 months after surgery； 5.2 mcg/dL 1 year after surgery； 8 mcg/dL16 months after surgery； and 9.8 mcg/dL 19 months after surgery. At last follow-up she was taking 10 mg of hydrocortisone every morning. Cosyntropin testing is not needed to assess the recovery of the hypotha-lamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. At our institution， we simply check a morning serum cortisol concentra-tion before the morning dose of hydrocortisone， and thisasSsSsesses hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone production， pituitary ACTH secretion， and adrenal cortisol secretion.删除5：<u>3</u>\nIn this case， the patient presented with unrecognized and long-standingACTH-dependenthypercorti-solism due to a pituitary adenoma. Eventually， she was diagnosed with CS， but only following the inci-dental discovery of a pituitary adenoma. Until then， her symptoms were attributed to polycystic ovarian syndrome (including weight gain， hirsutism， and dia-betes mellitus type 2). In a systematic review of 5367patients with CS， mean time from symptom onset to diagnosis was 14 months for ectopic ACTH CS，30 months for adrenal-dependent CS， and 38 months\n删除3：<u>Fig.54.1 Coronal images from head magnetic resonance imaging showed an 8×10×7-mm pituitary adenoma.</u>\n\n【13】for pituitary-dependent CS-a time lag that reflects the difficulties with making an accurate diagnosis. The time lag from symptom onset to the diagnosis of CS is likely due to nonspecific and mild symptoms that overlap with other conditions.删除5：<u>2</u>\nThe biochemical workup in our patient was consistent with ACTH-dependent hypercortisolism based on high-normal serum ACTH and dehydro-epiandrosterone sulfate concentrations abnormal l-mg overnight DST， and elevated 24-hour urinary free cortisol excretion. Notably， the late-night sali-vary cortisol concentration was not abnormal. In a systematic review and metaanalysis of diagnostic tests for CS， the sensitivity of late-night salivary cortisol concentration for the diagnosis of CS was95% and specificity was 90%.4 As no single test has100% accuracy for CS diagnosis， it is important to combine clinical suspicion of CS with several bio-chemical tests to confirm hypercortisolism.\n\n【14】Curative surgery for pituitary-dependent CS leads to adrenal insufficiency. Thus it is important to ensure that patients are initiated and educated on glucocorti-coid replacement therapy. Recovery of the HPA axis likely depends on the duration and degree of untreated hypercortisolism before curative surgery.6-8 Factors such as age， gender， BMI， subtypes of CS， duration of symptoms， clinical and biochemical severity， and post-operative glucocorticoid dose have been reported to affect the HPA axis recovery 3，6-8 Regular reassessment of the HPA axis should be performed in all patients with adrenal insufficiency following curative surgery for CS. Recovery of the HP axis takes months to years.3，6，8\n\n【15】Glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome (GWS) is a withdrawal reaction that occurs due to a decrease in supraphysiologic glucocorticoid concentrations. The mechanism of GWS is multifactorial and is mediated by the central noradrenergic and dopaminergic system， decrease in proopiomelanocortin-related peptides due to chronic suppression of the HPA axis， and rebound increase in cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6， tumor necrossiiss factor alpha， IL-1b， and prostaglandins， which occur with decreased glucocorticoid levels.9Patients often feel unwell with flu-like symptoms including anorexia， nausea， emesis， lethargy， somno-lence， arthralgia， myalgia， fever， and postural hypoten-sion. The symptoms and signs may be prolonged，and 删除换行 despite the glucocorticoid replacement， patients fail to immediately restore physical well-being and quality of life.10 Thus it is important to properly counsel patients about GWS before curative surgery.\n\n【16】Key Points\n\n【17】●The diagnosis of CS is usually delayed， sometimes for years， due to a mild and nonspecific presenta-tion. CS should be considered in any woman with symptoms of weight gain， hirsutism， and irregu-iar menses.\n\n【18】Both false-positive and false-negative results can occur in any tests for hypercortisolism， and thus the diagnosis of CS should be based on both clinical evaluation as well as a combination of biochemical tests.删除5：<u>4</u>\nMosstt women withmild-to-moderate eiACTH- dependent CS that is slow in onset will have pituitary-dependent disease.When1adefinite non-prolactin-secreting pituitary tumor is found on MRI in these patients， it is reasonable to con-sider proceeding directly to TSS.\n\n【19】●The periodic postoperative measurement of the morning serum cortisol concentration when the patient is on a single morning dosage of hydro-cortisone is a simple and inexpensive way to monitor the recovery of the HPA axis.\n\n【20】●Patients uniformly report that the glucocorticoid withdrawal symptoms following the cure of CS are worse than the CS itself.", "index": 4583, "show": true, "start": 4583, "end": 5134, "province": ["格式规范性", "多余换行"], "isEdit": false, "comment": "和【13】第一句为同段"}], "startTime": "2024/09/12 14:20:23", "endTime": "2024/09/12 14:21:21", "cost": 57.769}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:27", "update_time": "2024-09-11 22:21:20", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 22:20:21"}

CXR is sensitive in identifying hemothorax and pneumothorax， while echo-cardiography is useful in identifying pericardial fluid. Wound exploration of the chest wound is not recommended because the information gained is limited and the procedure is associated with the potential of producing pneumothorax. An ECG provides limited information regarding cardiac injury and is generally not done. A stab wound above the nipple line is rarely associated with intra-abdominal injury， therefore， CT scan of the abdomen or diagnostic laparoscopy is unnecessary.\n\n【16】8.2 D. CT of the abdomen may be useful in identifying injuries to the retroperito-neal structures in a patient with a stab wound to the back. That the patient is26-week pregnant does not contraindicate CT scan. Further diagnostic study would not be beneficial in patients listed in choices A， B， and C because these patients are exhibiting signs of significant injury that would necessitate urgent exploratory laparotomy.\n\n【17】8.3 C.

Your anesthetic technique was impeccable and could not possibly account for this situation. Triple antibiotics were used at the beginning of the case, which included ampicillin, gentamycin, and metronidazole (Flagyl). What is your differential diagnosis? Would calcium be of any help? Is another dose of neostigmine indicated? Another anticholinesterase? What are the disadvantages of using additional doses of anticholinesterases ? Does calcium have a direct effect on presynaptic portions of the neuromuscular junction? How long would you expect this problem to last?\n\n【12】6.  6.\n\n【13】    Tuberculosis —what do you need to know as an anesthesiologist?\n\n【14】Answers\n\n【15】1.  1.\n\n【16】    With temperature increases, oxygen consumption increases. The increase in metabolic rate is approximately 15%/°C. Thus, a child with a temperature of 40 °C will have an oxygen consumption of more than 150% of normal. In animal studies, hyperthermia has been found to increase MAC. Atropine has many pharmacologic effects mediated through blocking of the effect of acetylcholine: increased heart rate through its effect on the SA node, bronchodilation through its effect on muscarinic receptors in the bronchi, antagonism of gastric hydrogen ion secretion, and also inhibition of the activity of cutaneous sweat glands. This last effect can increase temperature although, in adults, hyperthermia is generally seen only with overdose of anticholinergic drugs. Increased body temperature and a cutaneous rash are sometimes seen in children who received only a therapeutic dose of atropine. Whether or not atropine should be given as part of a rapid sequence induction depends upon the clinical situation, and the patient’s body temperature should have very little, if anything, to do with that clinical choice.\n\n【17】2.  2.\n\n【18】    Nearly all peripheral arteries have been used for direct monitoring of blood pressure in children. Common problems associated with arterial catheters include emboli, distal ischemia, thrombosis of the artery, and infection. In this setting, in which the child has sepsis, complications are more likely. The sepsis and vasculitis of meningococcemia will lower blood pressure generally, and the inflamed intima of the cannulated artery will make the likelihood of thrombosis or embolism greater. On the other hand, direct, instantaneous blood pressure monitoring is very important for these critically ill children. Considerations prior to placement include the patient’s condition, whether or not the vessel has been damaged, and the amount of collateral flow. It is important to remember that the peripheral arteries of the lower extremity, the dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibial may exhibit pressure-wave amplification and may show a pressure higher than the aortic pressure.\n\n【19】3.  3.\n\n【20】    The congenital rubella syndrome involves virtually all organ systems of the body. Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) , often with associated microcephaly , is the most common finding. Manifestations of importance to anesthesiologists are myocarditis, patent ductus arteriosus, and pulmonary arterial stenosis. Assessment of cardiac function should be done prior to going to the operating room. Other findings are blueberry muffin skin rash, cataracts, sensorineural hearing loss, and hepatosplenomegaly.\n\n【21】4.  4.\n\n【22】    Chicken pox or varicella is a disease caused by human herpes virus. In the USA, most people acquire the disease during childhood. The AAP recommends vaccination for children >12 months who have not exhibited the clinical syndrome. There is a 10- to 21-day incubation period, but most children develop a rash 2 weeks after exposure. The rash is often preceded for 1–2 days by fever, malaise, and headache.\n\n【23】    The typical rash of fluid-filled vesicles often begins on the trunk. The vesicles appear in crops and may be quite extensive or may be few in number. Varicella is contagious for 2 days prior to the appearance of the rash and until the lesions have crusted. Transmission is up to 90% in household contacts and 30% for classroom contacts. Measles, or rubeola, is another common infectious viral illness. It is also very contagious with 90% of household contacts becoming infected. The MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine is given at 12 months and again in early adolescence. The clinical course of the disease has three phases: a 10- to 12-day incubation period; a prodrome of 3–5 days characterized by Koplik spots on the buccal mucosa, moderate fever, cough, and conjunctivitis; and the final stage of 3–5 days with maculopapular rash on the neck, arms, and legs and high fever. This child does not have any particular increased risk if he were to undergo general anesthesia and a DSU procedure. However, varicella and rubeola are both quite contagious, and infection can be quite serious in immunocompromised patients.\n\n【24】5.  5.\n\n【25】    Antibiotics can enhance neuromuscular blockade . There has been evidence of both pre- and postjunctional effects attributed to antibiotics. It is likely that there is no common mechanism by which antibiotics cause neuromuscular blockade, and thus there is no recommended standard therapy. If the recommended standard dose of neostigmine is not effective in reversing neuromuscular blockade, one option is to provide mechanical ventilation until recovery has occurred. Another option is the administration of sugammadex. Sugammadex has been effective in reversal of profound blockade by rocuronium in both children and infants 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Administration of calcium is not recommended since the antagonism to neuromuscular blockade is temporary and calcium may inhibit the antibacterial activity of the antibiotics.\n\n【26】6.  6.\n\n【27】    The incidence of tuberculosis is increasing worldwide. Recent immigrants to the USA, the homeless, and children with HIV/AIDS are specific groups of concern. Most children infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis acquired the organism from close contact with an individual with active disease. Children with TB can have various presentations. Many are asymptomatic and are detected when a skin test is positive. Progressive pulmonary tuberculosis can occur with the development of lobar or bronchopneumonia. Children with pneumonia or pleural effusions may come to the operating room for placement of thoracostomy tubes and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for drainage of empyema or bronchoscopy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. M. tuberculosis is a 1–5 μ-sized particle, and disease transmission is by airborne spread. When children with the diagnosis of tuberculosis come to the operating room, prevention of infection of the caregivers and contamination of the anesthetic equipment are of paramount importance. The CDC recommends protective masks be used that meet stringent filtering requirements. Filters are recommended for use in breathing circuits used on patients known to have TB 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 13:58:38", "endTime": "2024/09/12 13:58:48", "cost": 9.94}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:26", "update_time": "2024-09-11 21:58:47", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 21:58:37"}

This almost certainly represents a cephalohematoma. The more common caput succedaneum , which is swelling of the scalp soft tissue, is a normal response of the fetal head to the birth process. In this situation, the blood will cross over suture lines. When a soft tissue mass seems contained by suture lines, subgaleal cephalohematoma is suspected. The hemoglobin deposited in the hematoma becomes bilirubin, which is the reason for the infant’s icterus. A skull radiograph or CT scan is usually obtained to assess for skull fracture. Most of these hematomas will resolve with observation.\n\n【12】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【13】#### The Scalp and Skull\n\n【14】### OBJECTIVES\n\n【15】1\\. Be able to define the layers of the scalp\n\n【16】2\\. Be able to describe the structure of cranial sutures\n\n【17】### DEFINITIONS\n\n【18】MAJOR SUTURES OF THE SKULL: The sagittal suture runs along the midline of the skull between the two parietal bones. The lambdoidal suture runs left to right posteriorly and separates the two parietal bones from the occipital bone. The coronal suture has the same course anteriorly and separates the frontal bone from the two parietal bones.\n\n【19】HEMATOMA: Pool of blood that accumulates in a tissue or space, usually clotted.\n\n【20】BILIRUBIN: Bile salt that is formed from the breakdown of hemoglobin by the liver. It usually accumulates in the gallbladder and is excreted into the small bowel to facilitate digestion. High levels of bilirubin in the blood give the skin and sclera of the eyeballs a yellowish tint (jaundice).\n\n【21】ICTERIC: Yellowish appearance of jaundice, in this case due to the local breakdown of bilirubin in the blood that has accumulated in the hematoma.\n\n【22】CAPUT SUCCEDANEUM: Edematous swelling of the superficial scalp due to the normal trauma of the birth process that resolves within 2 to 3 days.\n\n【23】### DISCUSSION\n\n【24】The scalp is the unit of tissue that covers the calvaria. The tissue is composed of five layers and can be remembered by the acronym SCALP . Most superficial is the skin , which includes the dermis and the superficial fascia. Deep to that is a layer of dense connective tissue that binds tightly to the skin. The next layer is the aponeurosis of the occipitofrontalis muscle (galea aponeurotica). These three layers adhere tightly and move together as a unit. The fourth layer consists of loose connective tissue. The fifth layer is the periosteum , which covers the bone itself. The periosteum adheres tightly to the bone, especially in the region of the cranial sutures. The flexibility of the loose connective tissue allows the more superficial layers to move over the periosteum. In infants, the periosteum is adherent to the sutures.\n删除3：<u>Figure 43-1. The layers of the scalp: 1 = skin, 2 = connective tissue, 3 = aponeurosis, 4 = loose connective tissue, 5 = periosteum, 8 = outer table of calvaria, 9 = diploë, 10 = inner table of calvaria, 11 = endocranium. ( Reproduced, with permission, from the University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston Medical School .)</u>\n\n【25】The blood vessels that supply the scalp arise from branches of the internal and external carotid arteries. Anteriorly , these are the supraorbital and supratrochlear arteries, which are derived from the internal carotid. More laterally and posteriorly , the scalp is supplied by branches of the external carotid arteries. These include the superficial temporal arteries , which ascend in front of the auricle; and the occipital and posterior auricular arteries, which ascend posterior to the auricle. The arteries of the scalp are highly anastomotic. Therefore, after a laceration, blood may pulse from both ends of the cut artery.\n\n【26】The nerves of the scalp anteriorly originate from the first and third divisions of the trigeminal nerve. Medially , the supraorbital and supratrochlear nerves supply sensory innervation. Laterally, the auriculotemporal nerve provides sensory innervation. The posterior scalp is supplied medially by the posterior primary rami of cervical spinal nerves (C2, as the greater occipital nerve, and C3). Laterally, the skin is supplied by anterior primary rami that form the cervical plexus, in particular the lesser occipital and posterior auricular nerves.\n\n【27】Trauma to the scalp can damage blood vessels and hence cause a hematoma. The hematoma may spread within the same layer. Blood in the superficial fascia will migrate a little more slowly because of the septa within the subcutaneous fascia. In newborn infants, hematomas in this layer commonly result from the trauma of movement through the birth canal. Likewise, scalp trauma such as that induced by a suction-assisted delivery may occasionally injure the arteries within the periosteum, leading to accumulation of blood between the periosteum and the bone. Because the periosteum in infants adheres to the sutures, spread is impeded. A subcutaneous hematoma will cross sutures, but a subperiosteal hematoma will not. In adults, the loose connective layer is called the “danger space” because infection can easily migrate to the periorbital space. This is a dangerous condition because of the potential for spread into the cranium through the cavernous sinus.\n\n【28】###", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 11:19:08", "endTime": "2024/09/12 11:21:26", "cost": 138.231}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:26", "update_time": "2024-09-11 19:21:26", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 19:19:07"}

Supportive care and penicillin G\n\n【40】ANSWERS\n\n【41】43.11E. Observational studies suggest that immunocompromised patients with NSTI had delays in diagnosis and surgical treatment， because many of the patients failed to exhibit the usual clinical signs and did not have the usual W BC responses associated with NSTIs. Clinicians need to maintain a higher level of vigilance， consider additional imaging studies， and earlier surgical evaluations.\n\n【42】43.2 A. CT scan is highly sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of NSTI. The reported sensitivity is 100%， specificity of 85%， positive predictive value of76%， and negative predictive value of 100%； therefore， the CT scan is an excellent tool to rule-out NSTI.\n\n【43】43.3E. Impetigo is a common skin infection with small pustules that develop along with soft tissue inflammation. This process is nearly always caused by b-hemolytic streptococcus infections or Staphylococcus aureus. Treatment is antimicrobial therapy and skin care. The superficial abscess requires drain-age， necrotizing cellulitis requires debridement， deep muscle infection fol-lowing hip prosthesis placement will require surgical drainage and possibly removal of hardware. Necrotizing myositis will require debridement.\n\n【44】43.4B. This patient has findings consistent with N STI associated with injectional drug abuse. Based on the history of black-tar heroin injection， the infection is likely a polymicrobial synergistic infection. Early， aggressive surgical debride-ment and broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy are the keys to reduce mor-tality associated with this process. The role of hyperbaric treatment in this population is unclear.\n\n【45】43.5E. The descriptions given are consistent with a soft tissue abscess with a 3-cm rim of surrounding cellulitis. Incision and drainage of the abscess with antibi-otics treatment are the most appropriate for this patient.\n\n【46】43.6ID. The origin of the infection in this patient is the perirectal area. Abscesses that originate in that location are most likely polymicrobial in nature， and if left untreated， they can progress to develop polymicrobial synergistic NSTI. Hyperbaric treatment for NSTI has not been shown to reduce mortality； in fact， there is a general lack of strong clinical evidence to apply hyperbaric treatments for NSTI， and increase in hospital costs.\n\n【47】43.7IB. This man developed a severe infection of the hand and forearm follow-ing a puncture wound to the hand that he sustained during a fishing trip in the Gulf of Mexico. Because the infectious organisms might be water-borne bacteria， antimicrobial therapy needs to include coverage for Vibrio species(Ceftazidime， tetracycline)， and at the same time penicillin G should be included to cover for Gram positive organisms. Incision and drainage are also very important components of his treatment.\n\n【48】CLINICALPEARLS\n\n【49】)The most common findings in a patient with NSTI are local edema and pain in the presence ofsystemic signs such as high fever (hypothermia in some patients)， tachycardia，and often mental confusion.\n\n【50】》NSTI should be suspected when pain and tenderness extend beyond the area ofskin erythema.》When NSTI is strongly suspected， exploration of the wound through a limited incision may help to establish the diagnosis. Drainage of\"dish water\"fluid and easy separation of the subcutaneous tissue from the affected fascia is seen during digital exploration. Rapid，aggressive surgical debridement is the most important treatment for NSTI.\n\n【51】》 Lack of improvement after initial treatment of NSTI may be related to inadequate debridement and/or inappropriate antibiotic selection (lack ofsource control).\n删除16：<u>REFERENCE\n删除20：<u>Sartelli M，Malangoni MA， May AK， et al.

How long would the disease be likely to last in these infants?\n\n【1】2Ryridostigmine is an ideal drug for the treatment of myasthenia gravis. It inhibits the enzyme cholinesterase， which normally cleaves and inactivates acetylcholine. In this way， pyridostigmine prolongs the biological half-life of acetylcholine. Unfortunately， it also causes diarrhea by increasing the amount of acetylcholine in the intestine.Acetylcholine binds to the muscarinic receptors in the intestine and increases intestinal motility. Because he could not tolerate full therapeutic doses ofpyridostigmine and was getting worse， Mr Weld was given azathioprine and showed marked immprovement. What did the azathioprine do? What would concern you about prolonged use of this drug?\n\n【2】3 Mr Weld had a severe relapse in his disease after a respiratory infection. Many autoimmure diseases seem to be triggered by infection， and relapses in autoimmune diseases frequently follow an infection. Can you explain how this might happene\n\n【3】Answers: Answer 1\n\n【4】It would be likely to last 1-2 weeks. The infant has the disease because maternal IgG antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor have crossed the placenta from the maternal circulation to the fetal circulation. The infant is not synthesizing these autoantibodies； he or she has acquired the disease passively by transfer of the anti-bodies . The maternal IgG antibodies bind to the acetylcholine receptors in the baby， and the complex of the receptor with bound IgG antibodies is internal-ized into the cell and degraded. Within 10-15 days all the maternal IgG antibod-ies against the acetylcholine receptor are adsorbed from the babies’ blood and the symptoms abate.\n\n【5】Answer 2\n\n【6】Azathioprine is an immunosuppressive agent. It is converted in the liver to 6-mer-captopurine， which inhibits DNA synthesis. Thus， the growth of rapidly dividing cells， such as B cells and T cells， is inhibited and the immune response is suppressed. Unfortunately the effects of azathioprine are not specific. It suppresses not only the formation of antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor but also all other immune responses. Patients taking azathioprine become susceptible to infections. Ifused for very prolonged periods it is associated with the development oflymphomas. The rea-sons for this are not well understood.\n\n【7】Answer 3\n删除3：<u>Fig. A40.1 Antibody-mediated autoimmune disease can appear in the infants of affected mothers as a consequence of transplacental transfer of IgG autoantibodies.</u>\n\n| Mechanism  | Disruption of cellor tissue barrier  | Infection ofantigen-presenting cell  | Binding of pathogento self protein Pathogen acts ascarrier to allowanti-self response ?

Because some antigens are sequestered from the circulation， either behind a tissue barier or within the cell， it is possible that an infection that breaks cell and tissue barriers may expose hidden antigens (first column). A second possibility is that the local inflammation in response to an infectious agent may trigger the expression of MHC molecules and co-stimulators on tissue cells， inducing an autoimmune response (second column). In some cases， infectious agents may bind to self proteins. Because the infectious agent induces a helper T-cell response， any B cell that recognizes the self protein will also receive help.</u>\n\n【10】Such responses should be self-limiting once the infectious agent has been eliminated， because at this point the T-cell help will no longer be provided (third column). Infectious agents may induce either T-cell or B-cell responses that can cross-react with self antigens. This is termed molecular mimicry (fourth column). T-cell polyclonal activation by a bacteral superantigen could overcome clonal anergy， allowing an autoimmune process to begin (fifth column). There is little evidence for most of these mechanisms in human autoimmune disease.

Congenital lymphangiomas form due to the blockage of the lymphatic system during fetal development, though the cause remains unknown. The lesions typically appear before the age of five years. Acquired lymphangiomas occur in association with chronic lymphedema that leads to disruption of previously normal lymphatic channels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. They usually appear in adults after surgery, trauma, infection, malignancy, or radiation therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. A spontaneous occurrence has been also described. Clinically, lymphangioma is characterized by clusters of translucent or hemorrhagic vesicles resembling frog spawn located on the dull pink to violaceous skin. It ranges from small and well-demarcated malformations to large, diffuse ones with unclear borders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The lesions occur on any cutaneous surface or mucous membrane. The head and neck, proximal extremities, buttocks, and trunk are most commonly affected. The intestines, pancreas, and mesentery may also be involved. Lymphangioma may be associated with pruritus, pain, burning, and lymphatic drainage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Rare cases of squamous cell carcinoma, verruciform xanthoma, and lymphangiosarcoma arising within lymphangioma have been reported in the literature. In most cases, a clinical diagnosis can be made based on the history and clinical findings. Dermoscopy and histopathological examination can be used to confirm the diagnosis. Imaging may be warranted to assess the depth and extent of a lesion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. In dermoscopy, lymphangioma is characterized by the two patterns: yellow lacunae surrounded by pale septa without inclusion of blood and yellow to pink lacunae alternating with dark-red or bluish lacunae, representing the inclusion of blood 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Histopathology shows dilated lymphatic channels usually located in the superficial dermis, although they may extend to the reticular dermis or subcutaneous tissue. The treatment of choice for any type of lymphangioma is a surgical excision. Destructive treatments with carbon dioxide laser, long-pulsed Nd-YAG laser, and electrosurgery have been reported to be effective. Other therapeutic options include cryotherapy, superficial radiotherapy, and sclerotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 – 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】Differential diagnoses for the presented patient were basal cell carcinoma, bullous pemphigoid and linear IgA dermatosis.\n\n【27】Basal cell carcinoma is the most common skin malignancy. The incidence rate of the disease increases with age. Basal cell carcinoma presents as a tiny, hardly visible papule, growing into a nodule or a plaque that is sometimes ulcerated. The lesion is most commonly observed on the face, scalp or neck 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune bullous disease that mainly affects elderly individuals, usually above 70 years. It presents as itchy, tense blisters over normal skin or over erythematous and edematous background 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】Linear IgA bullous dermatosis is a relatively rare subepidermal vesiculobullous disease that occurs in both adults and children. In children, annular or polycyclic plaques and papules with blistering around the edges, primarily around the mouth and eyes, on the lower abdomen, thighs, buttocks, genitals, wrists and ankles are observed. In contrast, the adult-onset form presents as lesions on the trunk, head and extremities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】Based on the patient’s presentation, dermoscopic and histopathological examination, the diagnosis of acquired lymphangioma with coexisted basal cell carcinoma was established. A surgical excision was recommended for basal cell carcinoma. A superficial radiotherapy for lymphangioma treatment was planned after the surgery.\n\n【31】Key Points\n\n【32】   Lymphangioma is an uncommon, benign malformation of the lymphatic system that may affect the scalp area.\n\n【33】   It presents as clusters of translucent or hemorrhagic vesicles resembling frog spawn located on the dull pink to violaceous skin.\n\n【34】   Basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, verruciform xanthoma, and lymphangiosarcoma may arise within lymphangioma.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 14:30:14", "endTime": "2024/09/12 14:31:09", "cost": 54.298}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:26", "update_time": "2024-09-11 22:31:09", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 22:30:14"}

Due to her complex  删除换行 needs her GP always allows extra time to see her.\n\n【4】Questions\n\n【5】• Should GP surgeries provide appointments 7 days a week?\n\n【6】• Why has there been an increase in demand for primary healthcare services?删除5：<u>148</u>\n删除7：<u>100 Cases in Clinical Ethics and Law</u>\nANSWER 56\n\n【7】A recent report by the King’s Fund has shown an unprecedented slowdown in spending on  删除换行 the NHS over the last 2 years. Sadly, cracks are beginning to appear in terms of financial  删除换行 deficit and consequently patient care. The media headlines over the last few years have also  删除换行 helped promulgate a growing public dissatisfaction with the NHS as waiting lists for hospital  删除换行 services grow ever longer and the ability to book a GP appointment within a week becomes  删除换行 increasingly difficult. There are myriad different reasons for an increase in demand for care,  删除换行 including an aging population, advances in medical technologies and available treatments. \n\n【8】Combined with financial cuts to health and social care and government propaganda on  删除换行 ‘patients’ rights’ to healthcare, this has created a demand which is unable to be met.\n\n【9】Recently the debate over 24/7 access to primary care services has fuelled many hours of  删除换行 political hyperbole and reels of newspaper print. However, the simple truth of the matter  删除换行 is that there are insufficient healthcare professionals to staff a fully functional primary care  删除换行 service 24 hours a day. Despite promises to spend money on providing more GPs, in 2015  删除换行 one-third of GP trainee positions remain unfilled across the UK following the first round  删除换行 of recruitment 删除10：<u>(Pulse, April 2015)</u>. Being a GP is currently not a desirable career path for  删除换行 junior doctors and others in the profession are either taking early retirement or emigrat删除8：<u>￾</u>ing due to the increased workload and job pressures. Since the number of GPs available is  删除换行 unlikely to improve, the question posed by government should be whether it is preferable to  删除换行 have increased access to a doctor by enforcing extended opening hours or to try and improve  删除换行 patient care and continuity by keeping as many doctors as possible working core opening  删除换行 hours.\n\n【10】There are good reasons for these decisions to be made on an individual area basis. For  删除换行 example, a GP practice providing care to a high proportion of university students and young  删除换行 professionals may best be able to serve their specific population by being open later and at  删除换行 the weekends. This makes healthcare more accessible around working hours and in general  删除换行 a young population are going to present with more acute problems and have less complex  删除换行 needs. In contrast a GP practice with a primarily elderly population will benefit from more  删除换行 staff being available during core opening hours so that the patients can have better access to  删除换行 a specific doctor who will understand them and their medical history. The difficulty with this  删除换行 as a model is that acute illness or sudden deterioration in a chronic disease does not fit into  删除换行 a ‘9–5’ model.\n\n【11】Other ways to improve access to general practice and urgent care are also being explored by \n\n【12】NHS England in their document ‘Putting Patients First’. It highlights core aims as being to\n\n【13】• Provide better support for people to self-care\n\n【14】• Help people with urgent care needs to get the right advice in the right place, the  删除换行 first time\n\n【15】• Provide highly responsive urgent care services outside of hospital so people no  删除换行 longer choose to queue in A&E\n\n【16】• Ensure that those people with more serious or life-threatening emergency needs  删除换行 receive treatment in centres with the right facilities and expertise in order to  删除换行 maximise chances of survival and a good recovery\n\n【17】Recent articles in the Daily Telegraph and the Guardian listed some of the more bizarre  删除换行 reasons why people book GP appointments, including asking how to stop their cat from \n\n【18】 删除9：<u>http://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/ppf-1415-1617-wa.pdf149</u>\n\n【19】删除22：<u>Ethics and Law in Clinical Practice: Public Health</u>\n\n【20】scratching their furniture, complaining that their skin is too soft, requesting a prescription  删除换行 for shampoo to make hair shiny and asking for help to write their CV. Although most of the  删除换行 examples given were extreme, they highlight the ever-increasing demands being put upon  删除换行 general practice for non-medical issues. One of the more optimistic ways of looking at this  删除换行 is that the GP is a trusted member of the community who is able to give pastoral care and  删除换行 advice on a wide range of topics. A more pessimistic view is that the GP is free at the ‘point  删除换行 of abuse’ for both patients and organisations such as schools who may require proof of illness  删除换行 for childhood absence.\n\n【21】Greater patient responsibility for health and the provision of healthcare services based on  删除换行 public need rather than want is one way to address unrealistic demands on general practice. \n\n【22】This will ensure that the people who do need to see a GP can access a timely appointment and  删除换行 could therefore prevent an ongoing increase in A&E attendances.\n\n【23】Key Points\n\n【24】• Increasing demands on GP services which cannot be met has a knock-on effect on \n\n【25】A&E attendances.\n\n【26】• Local provision of appropriate alternative pastoral services is required to address  删除换行 non-medical needs.删除5：<u>151</u>\n删除22：<u>Ethics and Law in Clinical Practice: Public Health</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 13:55:00", "endTime": "2024/09/12 13:55:50", "cost": 49.592}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:26", "update_time": "2024-09-11 21:55:50", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 21:55:00"}

In this case， the cell captures a foreign macromolecule and degrades it， but the main function in this instance is the loading of peptide onto antigen-presenting proteins (MHC proteins)， which will expose the newly acquired antigen to examination by T cells. T cells that carry receptors recognizing the for-eign antigen in association with MHC proteins get activated and trigger the adap-tive immune response.\n\n【5】Secretory vesicles， whose function is to release their contents to the extracellular space or into other cells through exocytosis， also have an essential function in the immune response. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD8 T cells) and natural killer cells(NK cells) recognize other host cells that have been infected by viruses or intracel-lular bacteria and kill them by transporting secretory vesicles to the cell surface， where they fuse with the cell membrane and release their contents of enzymes and other mediators， such as perforin and granzymes， thus inducing apoptosis of the target cell.\n\n【6】In addition to their role in the functioning of the immune system， vesicles have an important role in pigmentation of the skin and eye， synapses between neurons， and platelet activation. As we shall illustrate， a defect in vesicle trafficking can lead to a devastating disease affecting many different functions of the immune system， as well as other organs and systems.\n\n【7】Shweta was seen by the immunologists at the Children’s Hospital at the age of4 years， with a history of recurrent ear infections and two episodes of pneumonia. At 2 years of age she had also had cellulitis (bacterial infection of the skin) and lymphadenitis (lymph node infection) due to Staphylococcus aureus， which required intravenous antibiotics. In addition， Shweta had a history of bruising easily and mul- tiple episodes of mild nosebleeds.\n\n【8】Shweta was born at full term and with a normal birth weight. Her umbilical cord separated normally at 10 days. Her parents reported that ever since Shweta was a baby， she seemed to be bothered by bright lights. She also had fair skin and hair， which was much lighter than the skin and hair of her parents and siblings and was unusual for her Indian descent. This was the reason she had been named Shweta. which means \"fair complexioned” in the Hindi language.\n\n【9】Her parents were second cousins， who had recently emigrated to the United States from a small town near Bangalore， India. Shweta had two healthy siblings， a10-year-old boy and a 17-year-old girl. There were no family members with a his-tory of recurrent infections.\n\n【10】On physical examination， Shweta was relatively thin and small for her age. She had a mild fever of 37.7℃ and slightly fast breathing. Her skin was fair and she had light brown hair with a silvery sheen. She had an atrophic scar on her left leg， the conse-quence of an old skin infection. The irises of her eyes were gray. An ear examination revealed a perforation and pus drainage in the right tympanic membrane， and she had moderate cervical lymphadenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes). Examination of 删除换行 her lungs revealed very poor aeration and crackles in the right lower lobe. Her abdo- men had mild hepatosplenomegaly (enlarged liver and spleen).\n\n【11】A chest radiograph confirmed that Shweta had a consolidation in the right lower lobe and a moderate pleural effusion， thus confirming a new episode of pneumonia. Aspiration of the pleural fluid grew S. aureus， which was broadly sensitive to anti- biotics. She was admitted to the hospital and started on intravenous nafcillin (an antistaphylococcal antibiotic)， after which she slowly recovered.\n\n【12】Laboratory testing revealed a white blood cell count of 5200 ul- (normal)， of which21% (1100 cells ul-) were neutrophils (mildly decreased)， 68% were lymphocytes(normal)， and 8% were monocytes (normal). Serum immunoglobulins and comple-ment titers were normal. Because of her history of infections and current staphylo-coccal pneumonia， neutrophil function was measured with a nitro blue tetrazolium(NBT) test， which assays the capacity of the NADPH oxidase in neutrophils to pro-duce the superoxide that reduces the NBT dye from yellow to blue .The results showed that Shweta’s neutrophils could reduce NBT normally. The labora-tory technician examining the peripheral blood smear observed giant cytoplasmic granules in her leukocytes， which stained positive with myeloperoxidase. She called the physicians in charge of Shweta’s care and told them， “this patient has Chediak-Higashi syndrome.”\n\n【13】After Shweta recovered from the acute infection， she was started on prophylactic antibiotics， and plans were made for a bone marrow transplant. Shweta’s brother proved to be a full HLA match and donated the bone marrow. Shweta was success-fully transplanted with full resolution of infections. Years later， during adolescence， Shweta developed a progressive neurological disease characterized by weakness， tremors， and ataxia， which confined her to a wheelchair.\n\n【14】Chediak-Higashi syndrome.\n\n【15】Patients such as Shweta have a very rare and severe disease called Chediak-Higashi Syndrome (CHS). This is an autosomal recessive disorder clinically characterized by recurrent bacterial infections and partial absence of pigmentation of skin， hair， and eyes (oculocutaneous albinism). Affected patients also have a ten-dencyto bleeding， due to platelet dysfunction， which is usually mild to moderate. If patients survive into adolescence or early adulthood， most will develop progressive neurological defects， including cerebellar ataxia， central nervous system atrophy， seizures， peripheral neuropathy， and cognitive defects. In addition， most patients with CHS undergo at some point an accelerated phase of uncontrolledlymphocyte proliferation and lymphohistiocytic infiltration characterized by fever， lymphad-enopathy， hepatosplenomegaly， and pancytopenia (reduction of platelets and of white and red blood cells)， which is usually lethal.\n\n【16】The diagnosis of CHS can be made by examination of a peripheral blood smear for the distinctive giant cytoplasmic granules (vesicles) in leukocytes and platelets. A similar phenotype of giant intracellular granules was known in the beige mouse strain， which has hypopigmentation of the coat .

In addition to humans and mice， other mammals with mutations in CHS1 have been identified， including the Aleutian mink， whose coat has a blue tinge.\n\n【19】All cells from patients with CHS have an abnormal clustering of giant lysosome-like vesicles around the nucleus. It is not yet clear how mutations in CHS1/LYST cause the vesicle defect， because the precise biological function of the protein is unknown. It is suspected that abnormal organellar protein trafficking may lead to aberrant fusion of vesicles and a failure to transport lysosomes to the appropriate location in the cell. Most mutations in CHS1 are nonsense or null mutations that lead to an absence of the protein， although some cases with milder phenotypes due to missense mutations have been described.\n\n【20】The main immunological defect of patients with CHS is in innate immunity， affecting the first line of defense to pyogenic infections of the skin and respira-tory tract. Infections are frequent and usually severe， beginning shortly after birth. Commonly implicated microorganisms include the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus， Streptococcus pyogenes， and Streptococcus pneumoniae， and occasionally fungi such as Candida or Aspergillus. Neutrophil counts are mildly to moderately decreased， probably as a result of the destruction of neutrophils in the bone mar-row. These cells also have decreased intracellular microbicidal activity. Affected neutrophils and monocytes have a chemotactic and migratory capacity that is about 40% that of normal cells. This may be due in part to the fact that the large fused granules impair the cells ability to move. In addition， cytotoxic T lympho-cytes and NK cells have severely impaired cytotoxicity because of their inability to secrete the granules that contain lytic proteins such as granzymes and perforin. Studies of B cells of affected patients also suggest that these are less able to load peptide onto MHC class II molecules and have decreased antigen presentation compared with normal B cells\n删除3：<u>Fig. 15.5 Abnormalities of hair</u>\n\n【21】The pigmentation defect of CHS is due to the inability of melanocytes， the cells that produce the pigment， to transfer pigment-containing secretory granules (melano-somes) to keratinocytes and other epithelial cells . Platelet dysfunction is due to a reduction in a particular group of vesicles called platelet dense bodies that participate in sustaining platelet aggregation.

Bone marrow transplantation corrects the immunological and hematologi-cal defects， and prevents the accelerated phase of CHS.

She called the physicians in charge of Shweta’s care and told them， “this patient has Chediak-Higashi syndrome.”\n\n【13】After Shweta recovered from the acute infection， she was started on prophylactic antibiotics， and plans were made for a bone marrow transplant. Shweta’s brother proved to be a full HLA match and donated the bone marrow. Shweta was success-fully transplanted with full resolution of infections. Years later， during adolescence， Shweta developed a progressive neurological disease characterized by weakness， tremors， and ataxia， which confined her to a wheelchair.\n\n【14】Chediak-Higashi syndrome.\n\n【15】Patients such as Shweta have a very rare and severe disease called Chediak-Higashi Syndrome (CHS). This is an autosomal recessive disorder clinically characterized by recurrent bacterial infections and partial absence of pigmentation of skin， hair， and eyes (oculocutaneous albinism). Affected patients also have a ten-dencyto bleeding， due to platelet dysfunction， which is usually mild to moderate. If patients survive into adolescence or early adulthood， most will develop progressive neurological defects， including cerebellar ataxia， central nervous system atrophy， seizures， peripheral neuropathy， and cognitive defects. In addition， most patients with CHS undergo at some point an accelerated phase of uncontrolledlymphocyte proliferation and lymphohistiocytic infiltration characterized by fever， lymphad-enopathy， hepatosplenomegaly， and pancytopenia (reduction of platelets and of white and red blood cells)， which is usually lethal.\n\n【16】The diagnosis of CHS can be made by examination of a peripheral blood smear for the distinctive giant cytoplasmic granules (vesicles) in leukocytes and platelets. A similar phenotype of giant intracellular granules was known in the beige mouse strain， which has hypopigmentation of the coat . The beige mouse was crucial in the identification of the human gene responsible for CHS， which was named CHS1 (Chediak Higashi Syndrome 1).

In addition to humans and mice， other mammals with mutations in CHS1 have been identified， including the Aleutian mink， whose coat has a blue tinge.\n\n【19】All cells from patients with CHS have an abnormal clustering of giant lysosome-like vesicles around the nucleus. It is not yet clear how mutations in CHS1/LYST cause the vesicle defect， because the precise biological function of the protein is unknown. It is suspected that abnormal organellar protein trafficking may lead to aberrant fusion of vesicles and a failure to transport lysosomes to the appropriate location in the cell. Most mutations in CHS1 are nonsense or null mutations that lead to an absence of the protein， although some cases with milder phenotypes due to missense mutations have been described.\n\n【20】The main immunological defect of patients with CHS is in innate immunity， affecting the first line of defense to pyogenic infections of the skin and respira-tory tract. Infections are frequent and usually severe， beginning shortly after birth. Commonly implicated microorganisms include the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus， Streptococcus pyogenes， and Streptococcus pneumoniae， and occasionally fungi such as Candida or Aspergillus. Neutrophil counts are mildly to moderately decreased， probably as a result of the destruction of neutrophils in the bone mar-row. These cells also have decreased intracellular microbicidal activity. Affected neutrophils and monocytes have a chemotactic and migratory capacity that is about 40% that of normal cells. This may be due in part to the fact that the large fused granules impair the cells ability to move. In addition， cytotoxic T lympho-cytes and NK cells have severely impaired cytotoxicity because of their inability to secrete the granules that contain lytic proteins such as granzymes and perforin. Studies of B cells of affected patients also suggest that these are less able to load peptide onto MHC class II molecules and have decreased antigen presentation compared with normal B cells\n删除3：<u>Fig. 15.5 Abnormalities of hair</u>\n\n【21】The pigmentation defect of CHS is due to the inability of melanocytes， the cells that produce the pigment， to transfer pigment-containing secretory granules (melano-somes) to keratinocytes and other epithelial cells . Platelet dysfunction is due to a reduction in a particular group of vesicles called platelet dense bodies that participate in sustaining platelet aggregation. The pathogenesis of the neurological disease that affects patients with CHS is believed to be due to problems of vesicular trafficking in neurons and glia.\n\n【22】pigmentation are diagnostic of CHS.

Bone marrow transplantation corrects the immunological and hematologi-cal defects， and prevents the accelerated phase of CHS. However， manifestations of CHS in nonhematopoietic organs， particularly the oculocutaneous albinism and the progressive neurological disease， are not modified by bone marrow transplantation.\n\n【24】Questions.", "index": 7435, "show": true, "start": 7435, "end": 7896, "province": ["格式规范性", "多余换行"], "isEdit": false, "comment": "和17段是一句话"}], "startTime": "2024/09/12 14:25:31", "endTime": "2024/09/12 14:28:26", "cost": 175.028}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:26", "update_time": "2024-09-11 22:28:27", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 22:25:30"}

How will you treat her  删除换行 initially?\n\n【17】• Interpret the blood gas results and suggest treatment options.删除5：<u>222</u>\nANSWER 83\n\n【18】The patient will need broad-spectrum antibiotics; whether they are given orally or intra删除8：<u>￾</u>venously will depend on the patient’s clinical status and her blood results. In this case,  删除换行 the patient is unwell and will probably need intravenous antibiotics for at least 24 hours. \n\n【19】A sputum sample should be taken and sent for microscopy, culture and sensitivity so  删除换行 that targeted antibiotic therapy can later be given. If possible, try to find out whether  删除换行 the patient has previously grown any specific bacteria in her sputum as this may guide  删除换行 antibiotic choice.\n\n【20】Prescribe bronchodilating nebulizers, starting with salbutamol, a B2 agonist, which will  删除换行 help to open up the airways. Nebulized ipratropium bromide, an anticholinergic, should  删除换行 also be given to block the smooth muscle acetylcholine receptors in the bronchi.\n\n【21】A course of steroids should be commenced, usually oral prednisolone for 7–10 days. This  删除换行 will dampen down the inflammatory response in the airways.\n\n【22】She will need an oxygen prescription chart, stating her target saturations, to inform the  删除换行 ward staff of how much oxygen to give her at any point in time and when to call for a  删除换行 doctor to review her oxygen requirements.\n\n【23】An arterial blood gas sample should always be performed on room air, to assess for  删除换行 hypoxia and hypercapnia. In this case, the patient had a blood gas on admission and a  删除换行 repeat test after oxygen was administered. The arterial blood gas may need to be repeated  删除换行 if a different concentration of oxygen is given or if her clinical condition changes.\n\n【24】If the patient’s condition fails to improve, other drugs (e.g. the bronchodilator aminophyl删除8：<u>￾</u>line) may be needed. If this is the case, the high-dependency unit should be notified, as  删除换行 she may need to be transferred to a ward with a higher level of care.\n\n【25】The first blood gas shows that the patient is hypoxic with a low PO2. The second blood  删除换行 gas shows that, although her oxygen saturations and PO2 have picked up with 2 L/min  删除换行 oxygen, her PCO2 has increased and she now has a metabolic acidosis. She has a low PO2 删除换行 and a high PCO2 – this is type 2 respiratory failure.\n\n【26】Due to chronic impaired gas exchange, this woman probably always has a high baseline \n\n【27】PCO2, which means that her hypercapnic drive has been blunted over time. In this situa删除8：<u>￾</u>tion, by improving her Po2 levels, you will reverse her hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstric删除8：<u>￾</u>tion that leads to ineffective CO2 excretion. Coupled with the Haldane effect, this would  删除换行 result in the further elevation of pCO2 and thence CO2 narcosis.\n\n【28】The patient will probably need non-invasive ventilation (NIV) to provide oxygen and help  删除换行 reduce her hypercapnia. She should be transferred to a high-dependency unit or a ward  删除换行 that manages NIV. She will need frequent arterial blood gas measurements to titrate the  删除换行 settings of the NIV.\n\n【29】The patient should have a ‘respiratory passport’ produced when she has improved, docu删除8：<u>￾</u>menting her baseline arterial blood gas results and stating that she is prone to type 2  删除换行 respiratory failure when given oxygen. Aim for the patient to have oxygen saturations  删除换行 of 88–92 per cent rather than >94 per cent as she can probably tolerate lower oxygen  删除换行 saturations. She should be reviewed by a COPD nurse for future management.删除5：<u>223</u>\nKEY POINTS\n\n【30】• Patients with infective exacerbations of COPD should be managed with antibiotics  删除换行 and oxygen as required. As some patients with COPD are prone to type 2 respiratory  删除换行 failure, arterial blood gas samples should be taken if oxygen is given to monitor for  删除换行 carbon dioxide retention.\n\n【31】• Once the patient has recovered from an exacerbation, he/she should be introduced to  删除换行 a COPD nurse specialist and an individual respiratory passport should be constructed,  删除换行 in the community if possible.删除6：<u>This page intentionally left blank 225</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 14:04:47", "endTime": "2024/09/12 14:05:20", "cost": 33.027}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:26", "update_time": "2024-09-11 22:05:21", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 22:04:48"}

In 2001, a prominent specialist stated:\n\n【2】> “However, despite the plethora of pharmacological agents that are available today, there remains a small but significant proportion of patients who suffer horribly from severe, disabling, intractable psychiatric illness. It is in these patients that surgery might still be appropriate if intervention is safe, reasonably effective, and without significant morbidity.” <sup>5</sup>\n\n【3】The main ethical issues connected to these interventions involve the scientific validity of the therapy and its evaluation, the validity of patient consent, and the possibility of conflict between the interests of the patient and those of society – particularly in the case of dangerous or violent individuals.\n\n【4】Accordingly, many questions remain to be answered. What are the indications? How are these techniques being evaluated and researched? What are the limits of informed consent? Are patients able to consent who have, in essence, lost a significant aspect of their freedom of judgment?\n\n【5】###### Current indications\n\n【6】A primary indication for psychosurgery is obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Treatment-refractory OCD is both tormenting and disabling. About 70% of psychosurgical procedures are currently performed for OCD, with notable objective improvement. Patient consent is not usually an issue, since patients are frequently aware of their disability, competent, and eager to pursue treatment.\n\n【7】Other possible indications include severe depression refractory to extreme pharmacologic therapy and sismotherapy (ECT), selected affective disorders such as treatment-refractory schizophrenic psychosis, and selected cases of aggressiveness to self or others.\n\n【8】In practical terms, pre-surgical evaluation to enable medical selection of patients applies solely to patients suffering from OCD. Selection criteria that are considered are: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> an established diagnosis for at least 5 years; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> significant suffering evidenced by validated clinical and social function scores; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> failure of the usual medications to control the disorder, either singly or in combination when administered for at least 5 years, or inability to continue medication due to intolerable side effects; 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> appropriate treatment of an associated co-morbid disorder, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> a poor prognosis for the disorder in question. In all cases, it is necessary to inform the patient of the risks, prefer less intrusive stereotaxic techniques, and obtain patient consent.\n\n【9】###### The relationship between therapy and research procedures\n\n【10】For all other indications, the scientific demand for research is dominant, in view of the uncertainties veiling both the pathology and its presumed treatment. Although a degree of tension emerges whenever potentially irreversible cerebral manipulation is considered, obviously the actual reversibility of new techniques can only be formally established through research. It therefore seems ethically improper to oppose research which aims to examine reversibility of the effects produced. According to a report of the French Bioethics Advisory Commission on the subject of consent通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>6 </sup></u> :\n\n【11】> The intricacy of the care and research relationship has become a major characteristic of “scientific medicine”. This should be a subject of pride. When it engages in research, medicine questions its own principles, corrects its mistakes, and progresses. Good research is not sufficient in itself to ensure quality health care, but it does contribute.\n\n【12】###### Consent\n\n【13】The concept of consent has very different implications depending on whether the perspective is medical, legal, philosophical, or ethical; whether it only concerns the individual in question; or whether it is given for the benefit of a third party. Consent remains a crucial issue in psychiatry, more than for any other medical discipline, and particularly so when psychosurgery is one of the options.\n\n【14】In the case of severe obsessive psychoses and OCD patients are fully conscious of the torment they endure and are often the first to call for the intervention. In the presence of this desire, physicians need to recognize the anguish created by the pathology, and consider whether they should accede to such requests. Understanding and sensitivity to the reality and intensity of the patient’s distress may bring the conviction that it non-ethical to deny such treatment to patients suffering from a disabling, chronic, and intractable disease. Furthermore, the risk of social, somatic and mental complications of non-treatment, including the risk of suicide cannot be discounted.\n\n【15】Consent may be easy to secure because some patients endure such suffering that they may be ready to accept, or for that matter demand, intrepid action. It is precisely this ease of securing consent that paradoxically raises ethical concerns. But an alternate, equally legitimate question is how long a patient can ethically be left to suffer medical therapeutic failure before offering the option of neurostimulation.\n\n【16】For patients suffering from aggressive delusional conditions (who may be dangerous for themselves or others), the question of consent is much more problematic. It is wishful thinking to imagine that the validity of consent (“free and informed”) does not bear scrutiny in cases where judgment is severely impaired. Nevertheless, all efforts must be made to secure the patient’s assent, even though this “consent” may be dubious in legal terms. Cerebral neurostimulation techniques may be appropriate in some particularly disabling treatment-refractory psychiatric pathologies. However, because neurostimulation for such patients is not established standard therapy and therefore is inextricably involved with research, a very specific concept of consent, validated by external appraisal, must be provided. For further discussion of consent for human subjects in research, see Chapter 27 .\n\n【17】In situations where both therapy and research are involved, consent takes on a new dimension. A physician must inform his patient of the consequences of the expected therapeutic effects, and also of the value of the research activity. Although it is clear that consent may be defective for patients suffering from psychiatric disorders, every effort must nevertheless be made to obtain agreement prior to treatment. Even though a particular patient’s “intervals of lucidity” may be very rare, assent should still be sought persistently to try to assure whenever possible that the patient has been able to understand, at least to some degree, the medical expectations and their consequences.\n\n【18】Confronted with a mentally disabled individual whose condition may risk violence to self or to others, society has a duty to protect the vulnerable, but while doing so, must also respect and protect the sick individual – who is also vulnerable. In the clinical setting as well as in biomedical research, pains should always be taken to do as much good and as little harm as possible, while respecting the freedom of decision of those one seeks to help. Even though duty calls for a constant effort to combine and reconcile these two principles, there often conflict between beneficence and autonomy. For example, the French Code of Ethics of the medical profession states: <sup>7</sup>\n\n【19】> Consent from the person under examination or care must always be sought …. when the patient is in a fit state to express his/her wishes, and rejects the investigation or treatment offered, the physician must respect that rejection, after having informed the patient of the consequences. If the patient is unable to express his/her wishes, the physician may not take action unless next of kin have been warned or informed, unless that is an impossibility or urgent action is required.\n\n【20】Therefore, the issue of “being or not being fit to express a wish” is the crux of the matter. Further detailed instruction in the Code of Ethics on this difficult matter is unambiguous:\n\n【21】> Consent from a mentally sick patient to treatment offered is most advisable and, if necessary, attempts to secure it may be insistent ; however, in case of refusal, the physician and the family must, in certain cases, ignore the patient’s wishes. When mental aberration is clearly established, or if the patient is dangerous, commitment by certification or voluntarily to a mental hospital or institution becomes necessary. The law dated June 27, 1990 <sup>8 </sup> on the commitment of the mentally ill, allows for the wishes of the patient to be ignored in certain cases, both as regards admission to a public hospital and administering treatment. When neurotic disorders or affective disturbances, even of a spectacular nature, do not alter the patient’s personality nor prevent reasonable decision, no treatment may be applied without the patient’s consent.\n\n【22】While the advisory and, in some cases, authoritative role of family members in providing consent for mentally disabled patients is recognized in Europe, such is not universally true elsewhere. In the US, where psychosurgical techniques and psychiatric interventions have been associated in public perception with manipulation or obliteration of free will, restrictions have been placed on consent for psychosurgical procedures and ECT. In some of the US, such treatments can be obtained for decisionally incompetent patients only by court order.\n\n【23】In many cases, a casuistic approach, based on a case-by-case discussion, is needed. In fact, the Madrid Declaration of the World Psychiatric Association states:\n\n【24】> Ethical behavior is based on the psychiatrist’s individual sense of responsibility towards the patient and their judgment in determining what is correct and appropriate conduct. External standards and influences such as professional codes of conduct, the study of ethics, or the rule of law by themselves will not guarantee the ethical practice of medicine.删除5：<u> <sup>9</sup></u>\nOne solution might be the formation of a formal committee tasked with establishing decision-making procedures for the purpose of providing support and protection to such patients. In the presence of severe psychotic conditions, it may not be best to accept a surrogate consent between the attending physician, the expert, and the family or legal representative. Rather, a committee including non-medical personnel as well as individuals capable of evaluating both the handicaps and misery endured by the patient, the family, and the entourage, might attenuate the pain and anxiety of making such decisions.\n\n【25】For procedures that involve considerations of research and care, every protocol should be approved by a special committee, according to criteria which define: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> conditions for approaching potential candidates; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> criteria for patient selection such as severity, chronicity, gravity and failures of prior medical treatment; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> validity of consent; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> mode of evaluation of results.\n\n【26】In view of new issues arising out of the emergence of experimental therapy, the committee’s task would be to preserve the integrity of suffering human beings and safeguard respect for their autonomy, as well as to consider what alternative objective help can be given to them. On the subject of psychosurgery, a working group of the Steering Committee on Bioethics of the Council of Europe stated:\n\n【27】> where States continue to sanction the use of it, the consent of the patient should be an absolute prerequisite for its use. Furthermore, the decision to use psychosurgery should in every case be confirmed by a committee which is not exclusively composed of psychiatric experts.删除5：<u>通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>10</sup></u></u>\n###### Electroconvulsive therapy\n\n【28】Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a procedure performed under general anesthesia during which a seizure is induced by application of electricity through electrodes applied on the head. After its introduction in the 1940s, as with psychosurgery, excesses involving its use in the 1960s and 1970s led to sharp criticisms questioning its very necessity. As with psychosurgery, negative associations of its use in public perceptions, both real (e.g. Frances Farmer and Ernest Hemingway) and fictional (e.g. Robert Pirsig’s Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance ) perpetuate suspicion regarding ECT. It nevertheless remains widely used throughout the world. Current indications for ECT are severe psychiatric disorders (severe depressions, melancholia) with a tangible risk of suicide. It is also used in cases of documented resistance to medical therapies for severe depressions and in selected patients suffering from maniac-depressive psychosis or severe schizophrenic disorders.\n\n【29】General anesthesia including muscle relaxants is mandatory to prevent musculoskeletal complications of seizures. Preoperative clinical evaluation allows recognitions of classic contraindications such as certain arrhythmias, or intracranial hypertension complicating some neurological disorders. ECT might even, in selected patients, have less morbidity than certain antidepressants.\n\n【30】The main controversy surrounding ECT involves the fear of psychiatric pathologies and their therapies. An important symbolic question also raised by ECT is the issue of dignity, which is deeply embedded in the concept of free will. Accordingly, the aim of safeguarding the patient’s freedom is central to the official declarations of psychiatric associations regarding patient rights. The World Health Organization recently condemned the abuses and violation of the human rights of people with mental disorders and Dr Jong-Wook Lee, former Director General of WHO urged:\n\n【31】> countries, international organizations, academia, the healthcare and legal sectors and others to take a hard look at the conditions of people with mental disorders and take action to promote and protect their rights.删除5：<u>通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>11</sup></u></u>\nThe question of how to best preserve the interests of the patient while having effecting human behavior, is key to this subject. The use of ECT should be performed in a non-passionate and dramatic way, and in cooperation with the patient. When obtaining consent, the clinician must believe that the treatment is performed in what he/she thinks is in the patient’s best interests, yet always keep open the possibility of patient refusal.\n\n【32】#### Key points\n\n【33】• Special societal implications of psychosurgery and ECT lead us to reconsider the hierarchy of cardinal ethical principles.\n\n【34】• Because of the investigational nature of more recent, less invasive and potentially reversible techniques, research and patient care cannot always be disengaged from one another.\n\n【35】• When considering Autonomy, Beneficence, Non-Maleficence and Distributive Justice, the physician has a moral obligation to respect the common good, with a fair balance between beneficence and the autonomy of the patient.\n\n【36】• Psychosurgery raises fundamental questions, such as those linked to the definition of person and free will, concepts of dignity, integrity, and the validity of true consent.\n\n【37】• In the quest for authentic harmony in the relationships between the health care provider and the patient, tensions between means and ends should be recognized, as well as the understanding of contextual influences, such as economic, political, scientific, and social perceptions, that may alter the consent process.\n\n【38】• Ultimately, decisions regarding psychosurgical interventions and ECT must be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account patient suffering and disability, and balancing these considerations with patient autonomy.\n\n【39】• Decisions regarding involuntary treatments may benefit from the input of established committees including non-medical personnel and representatives of the patient and their entourage.\n\n【40】####", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 14:28:12", "endTime": "2024/09/12 14:28:53", "cost": 40.78}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:26", "update_time": "2024-09-11 22:28:52", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 22:28:11"}

Understand the normal clinical presentation of women in the perimenopausal state.\n\n【12】2\\. Understand that the diagnosis of perimenopause is a clinical diagnosis and may include elevated serum FSH and LH levels.

Know that estrogen-replacement therapy is usually effective in treating the hot flushes.\n\n【14】4\\. Know the risks of continuous estrogen-progestin therapy.\n\n【15】Considerations\n\n【16】This 49-year-old woman complains of irregular menses， feelings of inadequacy， and intermittent sensations of warmth and sweating. This constellation of symptoms is consistent with the perimenopause， or climacteric state. The average age of meno-pause in the United States is 51 years old but can be anywhere from age 40 to58 age range. The majority of women begin to experience the perimenopause for several years before and after the actual menopause. The predominant symptom of hypoestrogenemia is the hot flush. Hot flushes are a vasomotor reaction associ-ated with skin temperature elevation and sweating lasting for 3 to 4 minutes. The low estrogen concentration also has an effect on the vagina by decreasing the epithelial thickness， leading to atrophy and dryness， but she will complain of symptoms long before actual signs are evident on pelvic examination of decreased vaginal rugation and moisture. With these changing levels ofestrogen and progestin during the peri-menopausal years leading up to the actual menopause， the woman will usually expe-rience altered menstrual cycles， with sometimes a skipped menses， a lighter one， or a prolonged one. Elevated serum FSH and LH levels may be helpful. However， these levels will fluctuate in the perimenopause leading up to actual menopause and cannot be relied upon until persistently elevated. The value is determined by the particular reference lab being used but in general is 30 mIU/mL or greater. Saliva testing of estrogen or other levels is not reliable and is expensive. Treatment for 删除换行 hot flushes may include clonidine， gabapentin， selective serotonin reuptake inhibi-tors (SSRIs) medications， or estrogen-replacement therapy with progestin， which is the most effective of the choices. When a woman still has her uterus， the addi-tion of progestin to estrogen replacement is important in preventing endometrial cancer. When estrogen and progestin are used in combination， this is referred to as hormone-replacement therapy (HRT). For a woman who has had a hysterectomy， the estrogen alone is adequate， and is referred to as estrogen-replacement therapy. Until a woman reaches the menopause， treatment for the irregular menstrual cycle may include a progestin or a low-dose oral contraceptive (dependent on her risk factors). This also has the added benefit of providing a back-up method for contra-ception. The choice of therapy depends on a careful review of the patients medi-cal conditions and risk factors for thrombosis， cardiovascular disease， and breast cancer weighed against the severity of the hot flushes. Bioidentical hormones or pharmacy-compounded hormones are not recommended as they are not as closely regulated as FDA-approved medications， and there are no studies that prove their safety or efficacy above standard therapies.\n\n【17】Note： The selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM)， raloxifene， does not treat hot flushes.\n\n【18】DEFINITIONS\n\n【19】MENOPAUSE： The point in time in a woman’s life when there is cessation of menses for 12 months due to follicular atresia occurring after age 40 years(mean age 51 years). It describes the final menstrual cycle， but is commonly used to describe the time in a woman’s life after that point.\n\n【20】PERIMENOPAUSE (CLIMACTERIC)： The transitional few， sometimes several years， spanning from before to 1 year after the menopause. It is characterized in the years leading up to the menopause by irregular menstrual cycles. If hot flushes occur， they usually increase in frequency as menopause is reached. The hot flushing may continue for several years after menopause.\n\n【21】HOT FLUSHES (FLASHES)： Irregular unpredictable episodes of increased skin temperature and sweating lasting about 3 to 4 minutes caused by vasomo-tor changes. Women often complain of night sweats， another form of hot flushes， which must be differentiated from a disease process or other causes.\n\n【22】PREMATURE OVARIAN FAILURE： The cessation of ovarian function due to atresia of follicles prior to age 40 years. At ages younger than 30 years， autoimmune diseases or karyotypic abnormalities should be considered.\n\n【23】somewhat. Symptoms include irregular menses due to anovulatory cycles， vasomo-tor symptoms such as hot flushes， and decreased estrogen and androgen levels. Because ovarian inhibin levels are decreased，FSH and LH levels rise even before estradiol levels fall. The decreased estradiol concentrations lead to vaginal atrophy， bone loss， and vasomotor symptoms. While most clinicians agree that hormone-replacement therapy is currently the best treatment for the vasomotor symptoms and to prevent osteoporosis， scientific data raises concerns about the risks of this therapy. The Womens Health Initiative Study of continuous estrogen-progestin treatment reported a small but significant increased risk of breast cancer， heart dis-ease，pulmonary embolism， and stroke. The cardiovascular risk was not seen in the women who were in the 50 to 59 age group—those women who were most likely to benefit from beginning HRT in the early menopause years. Women on hormone-replacement therapy had fewer fractures and a lower incidence of colon cancer.\n\n【24】Short-term hormone-replacement therapy (5 years or less) is indicated for vaso-motor symptoms， and should be used for as short a duration as possible in the smallest dose. It is the most effective therapy for relief of symptoms. For women who cannot or choose not to take estrogen， clonidine， or gabapentin may help with the vasomotor symptoms. Another class of pharmaceuticals that may be helpful to relieve the hot flushes is the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. A selective estrogen receptor modulator， such as raloxifene， is helpful in preventing bone loss， but does not alter the hot flushes. Weight-bearing exercise， calcium and vitamin D supplementation， and estrogen replacement are important cornerstones in main-taining bone mass. Because FSH responds to feedback by inhibin， the FSH level cannot be used to titrate the estrogen-replacement dose. In other words， the FSH concentration will still be elevated even though the estrogen replacement may be sufficient.\n\n【25】Other diseases that are important to consider in the perimenopausal woman include hypothyroidism， diabetes mellitus，hypertension，and breast cancer. Women in this stage of life may also experience depression， whether spontaneous in its onset or situational due to grief or midlife adjustments. The practitioner should advocate aerobic exercise at least three times a week， again， with weight-bearing exercise being advantageous for the prevention of osteoporosis. Bone mineral density (BMD) testing， such as by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA)， is useful in the early identification of osteoporosis and osteopenia. BMD testing is indicated for all postmenopausal women aged 65 years or older and postmeno-pausal women at risk for osteoporosis and presenting with a bone fracture. Alcohol abuse may be seen in up to 10% of postmenopausal women， and requires clinical suspicion to establish the diagnosis.\n\n【26】The Stages ofReproductive Aging Workshop (STRAW) research group published a system in 2012 that attempted to predict when women would go into menopause and also characterized the clinical and laboratory changes in the various reproduc-tive stages from adolescence through menopausal transition and into menopause.

He does have a swelling in his temporal region and is quiet; however,  删除换行 the rest of his examination is unremarkable.\n\n【12】Head trauma is a very common presentation in children with falls being the most common  删除换行 cause. Most episodes are minor and not associated with brain injury or long-term sequelae.\n\n【13】Clinical features of concern in head injuries include multiple episodes of vomiting, which  删除换行 may reflect raised intracranial pressure. Other features include significant scalp haematoma,  删除换行 prolonged loss of consciousness, confusion and seizures.\n\n【14】Emergency Departments in the United Kingdom follow the NICE guidelines on indications  删除换行 for CT scanning in head injuries. A non-contrast CT scan of the brain is indicated in this  删除换行 child because he has four discrete episodes of vomiting and a GCS of 14, 2 hours after the  删除换行 injury. The scan should be performed within 1 hour of presentation.\n\n【15】If there is any radiological evidence of intracranial pathology, then neurosurgical advice  删除换行 should be sought as early as possible.\n\n【16】Even if the CT scan of the brain was ‘normal’, the clinical picture suggests that this child  删除换行 requires a period of observation to see if he has further episodes of vomiting or a deteriora删除8：<u>￾</u>tion in neurological status (current GCS 14), which would prompt consideration of repeat  删除换行 scanning.\n\n【17】Patients should only be discharged when they have returned to their baseline function and  删除换行 in the absence of significant ongoing headache. The parents should be fully informed of signs  删除换行 that warrant a return to the Emergency Department for another medical review. This includes  删除换行 further vomiting, change in behaviour, drowsiness, unconsciousness, problems in speaking/ 删除换行 walking/with balance, weakness, seizures or clear fluid discharging from the ear or nose.\n\n【18】Any social concerns should be identified in the Emergency Department and discussion  删除换行 with social services undertaken if appropriate. Many children of this age presenting to the \n\n【19】Emergency Department with trauma, but no other social concerns, may warrant a health  删除换行 visitor referral and information may be shared with the Child Protection team.\n\n【20】Key Points\n\n【21】• Head injuries are common in children, but there are concerning features that  删除换行 warrant further investigation. These are outlined in the NICE guidelines on head  删除换行 injuries.\n\n【22】• If being discharged, patients should be given comprehensive advice on what  删除换行 symptoms warrant return to the Emergency Department. These are also outlined  删除换行 in the NICE guidelines, and most Emergency Departments have a head injury leaf删除8：<u>￾</u>let to give to patients.\n\n【23】• Non-accidental injury should be escalated via the paediatric or child protection  删除换行 team, depending on local policy.删除5：<u>293</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 14:56:02", "endTime": "2024/09/12 14:59:09", "cost": 186.903}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:26", "update_time": "2024-09-11 22:59:09", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 22:56:02"}

The histologic hallmark of acute inflammation， such as that seen with acute appendicitis， is the presence of numerous acute inflamma-tory cells， namely， neutrophils. Therefore， histologic sections of an appendix surgically removed from an individual with acute appen-dicitis will reveal numerous neutrophils within the muscular wall. The inflammation can be so marked that it causes complete destruc-tion of the muscular wall， which can lead to perforation and peritonitis.\n\n【20】\\[7.21 D. Acute inflammation of diverticula (diverticulitis) will produce the sudden onset of left-sided abdominal pain accompanied by fever and peripheral leukocytosis (mainly neutrophils). These clinical signs are essentially the same as those seen with acute appendicitis except that the abdominal pain is on the left side rather than the right side. As such， diverticulitis sometimes is referred to as left-sided appendicitis.\n\n【21】\\[7.31 B. Diverticulosis refers to the presence of numerous diverticula in the colon. The diverticula usually are located in the sigmoid colon in older individuals. Although they may become inflamed and produce signs of acute diverticulitis， more often they produce chronic blood loss as a result of chronic bleeding， which will lead to heme-positive stools and iron deficiency anemia.\n\n【22】PATHOLOGY PEARLS\n\n【23】Appendicitis usually is a 24-hour disease with periumbilical pain localizing to the right lower quadrant.\n\n【24】The primary treatment of appendicitis is surgical.\n\n【25】Appendicitis continues to have high morbidity and mortality in older patients.\n\n【26】Diverticula usually involve the left colon， particularly the sigmoid colon.\n\n【27】Diverticulitis presents as left lower abdominal pain， fever， and nau-sea and vomiting.\n\n【28】CT imaging is helpful in diagnosing both acute appendicitis and diverticulitis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 14:28:13", "endTime": "2024/09/12 14:28:27", "cost": 13.869}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:26", "update_time": "2024-09-11 22:28:27", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 22:28:13"}

She complains  删除换行 of a burning and slight itching with the onset of new lesions that then settle over a few  删除换行 weeks leaving marked pigmentation on her skin. Intermittently she has developed new  删除换行 lesions in addition to the old lesions flaring. She had no previous history of skin prob删除8：<u>￾</u>lems. Past medical history includes mild asthma, hayfever and hypertension. Her medi删除8：<u>￾</u>cation includes becotide and salbutamol inhalers, simvastatin, atenolol and ramipril; the  删除换行 latter was commenced within the last 2 months to help control her hypertension. \n\n【4】Examination\n\n【5】There are multiple annular hyperpigmented  删除换行 macular lesions on the skin over her face,  删除换行 neck and upper chest . No new  删除换行 erythematous lesions or recently ‘reactivated’  删除换行 lesions are apparent at the time of this clinic  删除换行 appointment.\n\n【6】Histology from her skin biopsy showed a resolving inflammatory interface dermatitis (at the  删除换行 junction between the epidermis and the dermis) with numerous lymphocytes and dying  删除换行 keratinocytes (civatte bodies). There was scattered melanin pigment in the upper dermis.\n删除3：<u>Figure 20.1</u>\n\n【7】Questions\n\n【8】• What is the diagnosis?\n\n【9】• What is the likely cause?\n\n【10】• How would you manage this patient?\n\n【11】INVESTIGATIONS44\n\n【12】ANSWER 20\n\n【13】This patient was diagnosed with a fixed drug eruption (FDE), which is an interesting  删除换行 phenomenon where exposure to a particular medication leads to annular erythematous  删除换行 skin lesion(s) which heal with pigmentation. Repeated exposure to the drug invariably  删除换行 causes reactivation of the old skin lesion(s) and may cause new ones to appear. Solitary  删除换行 skin lesions most commonly occur in FDE and preferentially occur on the genitalia and  删除换行 lips. This patient had the multiple FDE variant where lesions more frequently appear on  删除换行 the arms and trunk. There are reports of FDE lesions occurring on the genitals in patients  删除换行 who are allergic to their sexual partner’s medication. \n\n【14】The morphology of the skin lesions in FDE is somewhat variable, however. Classically  删除换行 they are circular or oval, macular or bullous and heal with pigmentation. Some FDE erup删除8：<u>￾</u>tions can be so inflammatory that central skin necrosis can result. \n\n【15】The exact mechanism of FDE is not known. Our current understanding is that the medi删除8：<u>￾</u>cation acts as a hapten which binds to keratinocytes within the epidermis. This triggers  删除换行 the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines which attract T-cells (CD4 and CD8) into the  删除换行 affected skin site. Reactivation of the skin lesions in response to re-exposure to the medi删除8：<u>￾</u>cation activates memory T-cells at the identical skin site(s). Histological appearances of  删除换行 involved skin show the action is at the dermoepidermal junction. \n\n【16】The onset of FDE usually starts within two weeks of commencing a new medication. \n\n【17】In this case the most likely culprit is the ramipril owing to the temporal relationship  删除换行 between commencement of the drug and the onset of the skin lesions. The most common  删除换行 culprit drugs include antibiotics, anticonvulsants and analgesics. However, FDE has been  删除换行 reported as being associated with many other preparations including over-the-counter  删除换行 medications, supplements, minerals and even foods. \n\n【18】The diagnosis of FDE is usually straightforward with a good history and classic clinical  删除换行 signs. If it is unclear which medication may be the culprit then an oral challenge can be  删除换行 useful. Histological appearances from lesional skin can help support the clinical diagnosis  删除换行 of FDE but is usually not diagnostic. Once the culprit medication has been identified this  删除换行 should be stopped. A potent topical steroid can be applied to any active lesions, which  删除换行 will help settle any symptoms and inflammation rapidly.\n\n【19】 KEY POINTS\n\n【20】• FDE lesions on the skin are reactivated each time the culprit drug is ingested.\n\n【21】• Lesions are frequently solitary and have a predilection for the lips and genitals.\n\n【22】• Skin lesions are often annular with central blistering/necrosis that settles with pigmentation.删除5：<u>45</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 11:28:01", "endTime": "2024/09/12 11:31:43", "cost": 221.736}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:26", "update_time": "2024-09-11 19:31:43", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 19:28:01"}

The patient denies any pruritus. On questioning he says his primary care physician recently put him on a regimen of drugs to control his high blood pressure and cholesterol. He also mentions that he sometimes gets a rash after taking antibiotics and usually gets “hives” every spring. The physician suspects that these symptoms are related to one of the patient’s medications. The accumulation of what substance is most likely causing the patient’s symptoms?\n\n【1】> (A) Bradykinin\n\n【2】> (B) Histamine\n\n【3】> (C) Prostacyclin\n\n【4】> (D) Prostaglandin E2</sub>\n\n【5】> (E) Serotonin\n\n【6】 Answer: The correct answer is A . The patient’s symptoms are of angioedema, a well-known adverse effect of ACE inhibitors. These drugs are generally prescribed to patients with hypertension. Angioedema is caused by the secondary activity of ACE on the degradation of kinins, including, most commonly, bradykinin. The blockage of ACE, and the commensurate accumulation of high levels of bradykinin, account for increased vessel permeability and subsequent edema in the face, lips, mouth, and subglottic tissues, typically without pruritus. Intestinal edema accounts for the patient’s gastrointestinal symptoms of diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Older patients with a prior history of drug-induced hypersensitivity and environmental allergies are particularly susceptible to ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema.  \n\n【7】Answer B is incorrect . Histamine is a biogenic amine that has a variety of functions, including inflammation, smooth muscle and vascular dilatation, and neurotransmission. Histamine released by mast cells is primarily responsible for the hypersensitivity reaction, although in this case histamine levels are not affected by the use of ACE inhibitors.  \n\n【8】Answer C is incorrect . Prostacyclin (or prostaglandin I2 ) is an arachidonic acid derivative, produced by the vascular endothelial cells from PGH2 . Its major function is to prevent platelet aggregation during coagulation. Prostacyclin is also a potent vasodilator, although its metabolism is not affected by ACE, and thus prostacyclin levels are not affected by the use of ACE inhibitors.  \n\n【9】Answer D is incorrect . Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2 ) is an arachidonic acid derivative that controls smooth muscle contraction, dilatation, and constriction of blood vessels, as well as the modulation of inflammation. It is also implicated in the induction of fever. However, PGE2 has no relationship to ACE inhibitors and the kinin-related effects of ACE.  \n\n【10】Answer E is incorrect . Serotonin is primarily a neurotransmitter produced by the CNS and certain peripheral neurons (enteric neurons). It is not involved in vascular dilatation and inflammation, and has no relationship to ACE inhibitors.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 13:42:39", "endTime": "2024/09/12 13:42:44", "cost": 5.296}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:26", "update_time": "2024-09-11 21:42:43", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 21:42:37"}

The etiology and pathogenesis of seborrheic keratosis are still not well understood. However the role of genetic predisposition, older age and ultraviolet light has been suggested 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Seborrheic keratosis is most commonly observed in the middle-aged and elderly, however it may also present in young adults. No gender predisposition is observed. Seborrheic keratosis is mostly presented in individuals with low Fitzgerald’s skin phototypes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Typical lesion is sharply demarcated, round or oval-shaped, elevated and stuck on the skin with a verrucous, dull, uneven, or punched-out surface. Flat seborrheic keratosis often has a smooth, velvety surface and is barely elevated above the surface of the skin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The color of the lesions varies from skin color, yellowish, light to dark brown, grey, and black. Seborrheic keratosis may present as an isolated or multiple lesions. The lesions appear anywhere on the body with the exception of the palms, soles and mucous membranes. The chest, back, scalp (mainly the temporal areas) and neck are most commonly affected. Seborrheic keratosis is generally slow-growing and asymptomatic condition. Irritation or trauma may cause itching, pain and bleeding with erythema or crusting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Rarely spontaneous resolution may occur 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. The diagnosis of seborrheic keratosis is mainly established based on clinical manifestation. Dermoscopy may be helpful to differentiate benign features from dysplastic or malignant tumors. Dermoscopic findings of seborrheic keratosis are milia cysts, comedo-like openings, fissures and ridges, hairpin blood vessels, sharp demarcation, and moth-eaten borders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. In case of ambiguity or features of malignancy such as ulcerated or large lesion and rapid change in size, a skin biopsy with histopathological examination may be recommended 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In histopathological examination, a proliferation of keratinocytes with keratin-filled cysts are typically observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In inflamed or irritated lesions lymphocytic infiltration may be present. There are numerous histopathological subtypes of seborrheic keratosis that vary in degrees of hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, pseudocysts, hyperpigmentation, inflammation, and dyskeratosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Seborrheic keratosis is benign and typically does not require any treatment. However, lesions are frequently removed because of esthetic reason. The therapeutic options include cryotherapy (liquid nitrogen or CO <sub>2 </sub> ), shave excision or topical agents (tazarotene, imiquimod cream, alpha-hydroxy acids, and urea ointment) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】Differential diagnoses for the presented patient were melanoma, pigmented basal carcinoma and melanotic nevus.\n\n【31】Melanoma is the most fatal form of skin cancer which most commonly affects the adult population. The typical cutaneous melanoma occurs as an asymmetric macule or nodule with irregular borders, frequently with variations in color within the lesion. Pink or red lesion may be also presented 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【32】Basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of skin malignancy. The incidence rate of the disease increases with age. Basal cell carcinoma presents as a tiny, hardly visible papule, growing into a nodule or a plaque that is sometimes ulcerated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The face, scalp or neck are most commonly affected.\n\n【33】The scalp is an anatomical location for nevi with site-related atypia, a subset of melanocytic nevi that share histologic features with melanoma but that are benign. The clinical patterns of the scalp melanotic nevi are solid brown, solid pink, eclipse and cockade. The lesions are mostly presented on the vertex and the parietal area 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【34】Based on the clinical presentation and dermoscopic features, the diagnosis of seborrheic keratosis was established.

Hypothyroidism has many common presenting symptoms that overlap with symptoms of the menopauissee ttrraansition删除10：<u>(Norman， 2010； North American Menopause Society， 2007)</u>. For example， Susan has described hair loss， fatigue， reduced libido， weight gain， irritability， memory loss， altered menstrual cycles， and reduced libido. These symptoms are all associated with both menopause and hypothyroidism删除10：<u>(Norman， 2010； North American Menopause Society， 2007)</u>. She has not described cold temperature intolerance， weakness， constipation， hair texture changes， skin texture changes (dry and rough)， or muscle aches， which are other symptoms associated with hypothyroidism 删除10：<u>(Norman， 2010)</u>. Additionally， she has described symptoms that are not commonly associated with hypothyroidism but that are commonly associated with the menopause transition， such as hot flashes， night sweats， and sleep disturbances 删除10：<u>(Alexander & Andrist， 2005； North American Menopause Society，2007)</u>. Given the overlap in symptoms and the potential for untreated hypothyroidism to exacerbate symptoms of the menopause transition， it would be prudent to check a TSH level for Susan.\n\n【20】Like hypothyroidism， a sexual desire disorder is an important comorbid diagnosis to consider for Susan. Reduced libido is common among midlife women； however， a specific sexual desire disorder can also be present. The management of these 2 problems differs， so it is important to distinguish exactly what Susan is experiencing. The most common sexual desire disorder among women is hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD)， which affects about 30% of women 删除10：<u>(Laumann， Paik， &Rosen， 1999)</u>. HSDD is defined as \"the persistent or recurrent deficiency (or absence) of sexual fantasies/thoughts，and/or desire for or receptivity to sexual activity， which causes personal distress’删除10：<u>(Basson et al.， 2000)</u>. The perception of distress experienced by the woman is a very important part of this diagnosis. While Susan described missing her previous level of desire for sex， she does enjoy sex when it happens； and she does not describe significant distress， noting that it is a “bummer\"and that she misses wanting sex like she used to. It is also unlikely that Susan is experiencing sexual aversion disorder as she does not avoid sexual contact with her partner 删除10：<u>(Basson et al.， 2000)</u>； con versely， she has noted that she misses their usual level of sexual activity.\n\n【21】Depression is less likely for Susan due to the array of symptoms that she is not experiencing and that are required to make a diagnosis of depression. The 4 edition of the American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) specifies criteria for the diagnosis of depression. DSM-IV states that patients must experience symptoms for at least 2 weeks， including a change in functioning with either depressed mood or a loss of interest in things that they used to enjoy. Additionally， there must be at least 5 other symptoms， which can include depressed mood or loss of interest in enjoyable activities/anhedonia， as well as substantive appetite and weight changes， sleep disturbances， suicidal thoughts or ideation， feeling worthless or excessively guilty， fatigue， cognitive changes (forgetfulness， difficulty concentrating)， or psychomotor changes (retarda-tion or agitation) 删除10：<u>(American Psychiatric Association， 2000)</u>. When considering depression it is important to note that Susan does not describe enough symptoms to meet the DSM-IV criteria for depression. However， it is also important to recognize that depression often does affect women at midlife and may exacerbate symptoms of the menopause transition 删除10：<u>(North American Menopause Society， 2007)</u>.\n\n【22】Other even less likely differentials might include TB， untreated DM or HTN， and other psychiatric disorders. None of these diagnoses carry enough overlapping symptoms with those described by Susan and commonly associated with the menopause transition to make them likely as her primary diagnosis. DM and HTN could exacerbate her menopause transition symptoms. However， she does not have an elevated BP on examination； and she does not have symptoms suggestive of DM. TB is the least likely of all because the only overlapping symptom is night sweats.\n\n【23】What is your plan of treatment?\n\n【24】Most of Susan's symptoms are related to her hot flashes. Vasomotor symptoms cause sleep disrup-tions， which in turn affect mood， energy level， memory， and cognitive processes. Once the hot flashes are controlled and sleep is restored the associated symptoms usually will resolve (North American\n\n【25】Menopause Society， 2007). A stepped approach is recommended for managing vasomotor symptoms associated with the menopause transition 删除10：<u>(Alexander & Andrist， 2005； Nachtigall et al.， 2006； North American Menopause Society， 2007， 2008， 2010a)</u>. Start by advising Susan about lifestyle and envi-ronmental changes that can reduce her symptoms， then explore complementary and alternative medicine therapies (CAM) that might help her， and finally prescribe medications if needed.\n\n【26】Susan likely would benefit from increasing her routine aerobic activity. Her goal should be at least1 hour each day， but even small increases may be beneficial 删除10：<u>(Lindh-Astrand， Nedstrand， Wyon， &Hammar， 2004； Thompson， Church， & Blair， 2008)</u>.

Reducing or avoiding use of these substances can reduce both frequency and severity of her vasomotor symptoms 删除10：<u>(Alexander et al.，2003； North American Menopause Society， 2007)</u>. Increasing her consumption of ice water may help to stabilize her core temperature and reduce hot flashes.\n\n【28】Susan can further reduce her symptoms by wearing breathable fabrics like cottons that allow for greater air movement and avoiding synthetics and tight clothing. Wearing layers that can easily be removed when she feels hot and avoiding high necklines and turtleneck shirts may reduce her symp-toms and embarrassment at work. Using breathable fabrics for her pajamas， sheets， and blankets is important as well. A fan to circulate the air and keeping the room temperature at a moderately cool level may also reduce hot flashes 删除10：<u>(Alexander et al.， 2003， 2004； North American Menopause Society，2007)</u>.\n\n【29】Several CAM therapies such as relaxation and deep breathing exercises， acupuncture， and selected botanical or herbal preparations may be useful in reducing vasomotor symptoms caused by the menopause transition. Stress and anxiety are triggers for hot flashes 删除10：<u>(Alexander et al.， 2004)</u>， so it stands to reason that relaxation and stress-reducing practices， like yoga， prayer， and talking over problems， can decrease hot flashes 删除10：<u>(Alexander et al.， 2004； Carson， Carson， Porter，& Keefe， 2008)</u>. Susan can be taught to do paced deep breathing (like yoga breathing： breathe in deeply over a count of 4， hold the breath for a count of 7， then exhale over a count of 9) to reduce hot flashes when they occur or to reduce her stress in general 删除10：<u>(Freedman & Woodward， 1992；Freedman， Woodward， Brown， Javaid， & Pandy， 1995； Irvin， Domar， Clark， Zuttermeister， & Freidman， 1996)</u>.

This diagnosis is usually made based on the history and physical examination. Selected diagnostic studies may be warranted to rule out comorbid condi-tions that may affect her symptom severity and the management plan 删除10：<u>(Alexander & Andrist， 2005； North American Menopause Society， 2007)</u>.\n\n【19】A thyroid disorder， especially hypothyroidism， must also be considered. Hypothyroidism has many common presenting symptoms that overlap with symptoms of the menopauissee ttrraansition删除10：<u>(Norman， 2010； North American Menopause Society， 2007)</u>. For example， Susan has described hair loss， fatigue， reduced libido， weight gain， irritability， memory loss， altered menstrual cycles， and reduced libido. These symptoms are all associated with both menopause and hypothyroidism删除10：<u>(Norman， 2010； North American Menopause Society， 2007)</u>. She has not described cold temperature intolerance， weakness， constipation， hair texture changes， skin texture changes (dry and rough)， or muscle aches， which are other symptoms associated with hypothyroidism 删除10：<u>(Norman， 2010)</u>. Additionally， she has described symptoms that are not commonly associated with hypothyroidism but that are commonly associated with the menopause transition， such as hot flashes， night sweats， and sleep disturbances 删除10：<u>(Alexander & Andrist， 2005； North American Menopause Society，2007)</u>. Given the overlap in symptoms and the potential for untreated hypothyroidism to exacerbate symptoms of the menopause transition， it would be prudent to check a TSH level for Susan.\n\n【20】Like hypothyroidism， a sexual desire disorder is an important comorbid diagnosis to consider for Susan. Reduced libido is common among midlife women； however， a specific sexual desire disorder can also be present. The management of these 2 problems differs， so it is important to distinguish exactly what Susan is experiencing. The most common sexual desire disorder among women is hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD)， which affects about 30% of women 删除10：<u>(Laumann， Paik， &Rosen， 1999)</u>. HSDD is defined as \"the persistent or recurrent deficiency (or absence) of sexual fantasies/thoughts，and/or desire for or receptivity to sexual activity， which causes personal distress’删除10：<u>(Basson et al.， 2000)</u>. The perception of distress experienced by the woman is a very important part of this diagnosis. While Susan described missing her previous level of desire for sex， she does enjoy sex when it happens； and she does not describe significant distress， noting that it is a “bummer\"and that she misses wanting sex like she used to. It is also unlikely that Susan is experiencing sexual aversion disorder as she does not avoid sexual contact with her partner 删除10：<u>(Basson et al.， 2000)</u>； con versely， she has noted that she misses their usual level of sexual activity.\n\n【21】Depression is less likely for Susan due to the array of symptoms that she is not experiencing and that are required to make a diagnosis of depression. The 4 edition of the American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) specifies criteria for the diagnosis of depression. DSM-IV states that patients must experience symptoms for at least 2 weeks， including a change in functioning with either depressed mood or a loss of interest in things that they used to enjoy. Additionally， there must be at least 5 other symptoms， which can include depressed mood or loss of interest in enjoyable activities/anhedonia， as well as substantive appetite and weight changes， sleep disturbances， suicidal thoughts or ideation， feeling worthless or excessively guilty， fatigue， cognitive changes (forgetfulness， difficulty concentrating)， or psychomotor changes (retarda-tion or agitation) 删除10：<u>(American Psychiatric Association， 2000)</u>. When considering depression it is important to note that Susan does not describe enough symptoms to meet the DSM-IV criteria for depression. However， it is also important to recognize that depression often does affect women at midlife and may exacerbate symptoms of the menopause transition 删除10：<u>(North American Menopause Society， 2007)</u>.\n\n【22】Other even less likely differentials might include TB， untreated DM or HTN， and other psychiatric disorders. None of these diagnoses carry enough overlapping symptoms with those described by Susan and commonly associated with the menopause transition to make them likely as her primary diagnosis. DM and HTN could exacerbate her menopause transition symptoms. However， she does not have an elevated BP on examination； and she does not have symptoms suggestive of DM. TB is the least likely of all because the only overlapping symptom is night sweats.\n\n【23】What is your plan of treatment?\n\n【24】Most of Susan's symptoms are related to her hot flashes. Vasomotor symptoms cause sleep disrup-tions， which in turn affect mood， energy level， memory， and cognitive processes. Once the hot flashes are controlled and sleep is restored the associated symptoms usually will resolve (North American\n\n【25】Menopause Society， 2007). A stepped approach is recommended for managing vasomotor symptoms associated with the menopause transition 删除10：<u>(Alexander & Andrist， 2005； Nachtigall et al.， 2006； North American Menopause Society， 2007， 2008， 2010a)</u>. Start by advising Susan about lifestyle and envi-ronmental changes that can reduce her symptoms， then explore complementary and alternative medicine therapies (CAM) that might help her， and finally prescribe medications if needed.\n\n【26】Susan likely would benefit from increasing her routine aerobic activity. Her goal should be at least1 hour each day， but even small increases may be beneficial 删除10：<u>(Lindh-Astrand， Nedstrand， Wyon， &Hammar， 2004； Thompson， Church， & Blair， 2008)</u>. Aerobic exercise helps to decrease hot flash sever-ity and frequency by improving the body's ability to maintain temperature regulation 删除10：<u>(Alexander， Ruff， & Udemezue， u.d.； Lindh-Astrand et al.， 2004； Thompson et al.， 2008； Villaverde-Gutierrez et al.， 2006)</u>. Regular exercise also improves sleep quality， memory， and quality of life； decreases depres-sion； reduces cardiac disease risk； and helps to maintain normal blood glucose levels and weight in midlife women 删除10：<u>(Alexander et al.， u.d.； Gold et al.， 2000； Lindh-Astrand et al.， 2004； Thompson et al.，2008；Villaverde-Gutierrez et al.， 2006)</u>.\n\n【27】Susan also needs to be counseled to avoid hot flash triggers such as caffeine (any type can trigger flashes-cold， hot， solid， liquid)， concentrated sugar， and alcohol. Reducing or avoiding use of these substances can reduce both frequency and severity of her vasomotor symptoms 删除10：<u>(Alexander et al.，2003； North American Menopause Society， 2007)</u>. Increasing her consumption of ice water may help to stabilize her core temperature and reduce hot flashes.\n\n【28】Susan can further reduce her symptoms by wearing breathable fabrics like cottons that allow for greater air movement and avoiding synthetics and tight clothing. Wearing layers that can easily be removed when she feels hot and avoiding high necklines and turtleneck shirts may reduce her symp-toms and embarrassment at work. Using breathable fabrics for her pajamas， sheets， and blankets is important as well. A fan to circulate the air and keeping the room temperature at a moderately cool level may also reduce hot flashes 删除10：<u>(Alexander et al.， 2003， 2004； North American Menopause Society，2007)</u>.\n\n【29】Several CAM therapies such as relaxation and deep breathing exercises， acupuncture， and selected botanical or herbal preparations may be useful in reducing vasomotor symptoms caused by the menopause transition. Stress and anxiety are triggers for hot flashes 删除10：<u>(Alexander et al.， 2004)</u>， so it stands to reason that relaxation and stress-reducing practices， like yoga， prayer， and talking over problems， can decrease hot flashes 删除10：<u>(Alexander et al.， 2004； Carson， Carson， Porter，& Keefe， 2008)</u>. Susan can be taught to do paced deep breathing (like yoga breathing： breathe in deeply over a count of 4， hold the breath for a count of 7， then exhale over a count of 9) to reduce hot flashes when they occur or to reduce her stress in general 删除10：<u>(Freedman & Woodward， 1992；Freedman， Woodward， Brown， Javaid， & Pandy， 1995； Irvin， Domar， Clark， Zuttermeister， & Freidman， 1996)</u>. Acupuncture is another CAM therapy that provides stress relief. Although several studies have evaluated acupuncture for vasomotor symptom management， clear evidence supporting its efficacy has been lacking 删除10：<u>(Lee， Shin，& Ernst， 2009)</u>. Even so， Susan could try acupuncture if she is interested； it is a well-accepted and safe practice that promotes relaxationL.删除17：<u>恤</u>\n\n【30】Many women are interested in trying botanical and herbal preparations to manage their meno-pause transition symptoms 删除10：<u>(Brett & Keenan， 2007； Newton， Buist， Keenan， Anderson， & LaCroix，2002)</u>. Several preparations are commonly used including black cohosh， dong quai， various isofla-vones (i.e.， soy extracts， red clover， soy supplementation)， oil of evening primrose， and ginseng删除10：<u>(Ihenacho， 2009； Kupferer， Dormire， & Becker， 2009)</u>. Black cohosh is usually well tolerated and has the most evidence supporting its use. It may have some estrogenic activity 删除10：<u>(Bolle， Mastrangelo， Perrone， & Evandri， 2007； Rice， Amon， & Whitehead， 2007)</u>， so if Susan decides to try this she will need to be monitored for endometrial overgrowth. She also needs to be warned to watch for signs of liver problems as case reports have identified hepatitis and liver toxicity in some women 删除10：<u>(Mahady et al.， 2008)</u>.\n\n【31】Pharmacotherapeutics-Both nonhormonal and hormonal prescription options are available to help Susan if she is still experiencing moderate to severe symptoms . Many women wish to avoid the use of hormones， so Susan needs to be carefully questioned about her specific preferences. Additionally， because every medication has contraindications， Susan's medical， family， and personal history must be carefully reviewed to assure that any specific medication being consid-", "index": 11261, "show": true, "start": 11248, "end": 11252, "comment": "【24】(North American              【25】Menopause Society， 2007).", "isEdit": false, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"]}], "startTime": "2024/09/12 14:13:23", "endTime": "2024/09/12 14:15:24", "cost": 121.273}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:26", "update_time": "2024-09-11 22:15:25", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 22:13:23"}

He had been on his usual 3–4 L/min of oxygen by nasal cannula but just could not catch his breath. He denied fever, wheezing or a productive cough. In the emergency department a 100% oxygen nonrebreather mask was required to maintain oxygen saturations >90%. On physical exam he had a pulse of 112, was tachypneic at 22 breaths per minute, blood pressure was 118/73 and he was afebrile. His lung exam revealed no wheezing but a few rales in the right base and a pulmonary flow murmur on the right. His cardiac exam revealed a markedly increased pulmonic component of the second heart sound, a grade 2/6 systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border, a right ventricular S3, and a right ventricular heave. He had JVD to the jaw and 2+ lower extremity pitting edema to the knees. He had a normal white blood cell count, his hemoglobin was elevated at 17.6 mg/dL, platelet count was normal, electrolytes and renal function were normal and an N-terminal proBrain natriuretic peptide was 5354 pg/mL. A portable chest X-ray was performed  which revealed marked cardiomegaly and large pulmonary arteries. Lasix was administered and he was admitted to the intensive care unit.\n删除3：<u>Figure 5.1\n\n【21】Admission chest radiograph demonstrating cardiomegaly and massively enlarged central pulmonary arteries\n</u>\nPrior to presentation, he was unable to walk through large grocery stores without stopping. However, he drives, cares for himself, and does his other activities of daily living. He is using 3 L oxygen by nasal cannula at all times but his oxygen saturations drop to the 70s when walking short distances. Recently in clinic his 6-min walk test showed a distance of 134 m with oxygen saturations 80–86% on 25 L per nasal cannula.\n\n【22】His pulmonary function testing reveals an FEV1 of 1.89 L (54% of predicted), FVC of 3.66 L (78% predicted), and an FEV1/FVC ratio of 51%. The patient was unable to perform the lung volume or DLCO maneuver due to dyspnea and hypoxemia.\n\n【23】By provided history, at age 19 he was diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism after presenting with hemoptysis and was anticoagulated for several months but then enlisted in the United States Army and stopped his warfarin. He stayed off of the warfarin until 1990 when he presented with dyspnea and was found to have an “acute PE in the main pulmonary artery.” He again was treated with warfarin but only took it for 1–2 years and then was lost to follow-up. He presented to a health care provider for routine care and was restarted on anticoagulation in 2000 and has been on it ever since. He has been a heavy smoker for the past 30 years and was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) a decade ago by pulmonary function testing. He started using oxygen about 8 years ago. The patient has had frequent admissions for COPD exacerbation characterized by productive cough, dyspnea, wheezing and an increased oxygen requirement. At the time of each episode he is treated with antibiotics and steroids and improves. His pulmonologist noted he had pulmonary hypertension, and recognized that it might be related to chronic thromboembolic disease after a ventilation/perfusion scan and computed tomography of the chest were obtained. He was started him on an oral prostacyclin approximately 8 months prior to presentation. The patient felt much worse on this and his oxygen requirement had been increasing.\n\n【24】Other past medical history included a gastric ulcer, chronic atrial fibrillation, gout, a chainsaw accident with a hand injury and squamous cell skin cancer. He has been evaluated for a thrombophilia but none was found.\n\n【25】Social History is notable for smoking 3/4 pack per day for 30 years. Upon presentation he was smoking e-cigarettes. He has a significant alcohol history and consumed at least 20 cans of beer per week for 30 years. He now drinks 1–2 beers per week. He worked in oil field, drilling. In the Army, he was a transportation security gunner.\n\n【26】Family history was significant for coronary artery disease but no clotting disorders, pulmonary emboli or deep vein thrombosis.\n\n【27】A ventilation perfusion scan was performed. There were segmental V/Q mismatches in the anterior left upper lobe, the lingula, and to a lesser extent, in the LLL. Overall perfusion to the right lung was reduced sparing a small region of the anterior right lower lobe .\n删除3：<u>Figure 5.2\n\n【28】Abnormal perfusion scintigraphy with distinct segmental defects involving primarily the left lung\n</u>\nA CT angiogram was performed revealing large pulmonary arteries with lining, calcified clot in the main pulmonary arteries and bilateral segmental branches, and an enlarged right atrium and ventricle .\n删除3：<u>Figure 5.3\n\n【29】Calcified thrombus lining the central pulmonary vessels.

Coronary angiography revealed no significant coronary disease.\n\n【32】During this evaluation, the patient was in the ICU on a high flow nasal cannula. The oral prostacyclin therapy was titrated to off because of concerns that it may be worsening ventilation/perfusion mismatching and an oral phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor was titrated up to a high dosage. He was diuresed aggressively and his decompensated right ventricular failure was treated with a dopamine infusion to decrease right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The patient tolerated this well and after approximately 2.5 weeks in the ICU and another 1.5 weeks on the hospital floor he was transferred to home on 6 L per nasal cannula. He was evaluated for pulmonary thromboendarterectomy including a second review by an experienced center and it was determined he was a poor candidate due to his degree of pulmonary parenchymal disease. A transplant evaluation was pursued and completed while the patient was an inpatient and he was listed for transplant shortly thereafter. He underwent successful lung transplantation approximately 1 month later. He is doing well at home and is no longer needing oxygen.\n\n【33】Radiographic Interpretation\n---------------------------\n\n【34】Chest radiograph shows cardiomegaly with marked proximal pulmonary artery dilatation. There is calcification, seen most prominently in the main PA. Subsegmental atelectasis is present in the right lower lobe. There is a small left pleural effusion. Overall, the appearances are that of long standing PH with likely pulmonary congestion.\n\n【35】The findings on perfusion scan with the presence of large bilateral segmental perfusion defects is highly suspicious for thromboembolic disease rather than PAH as the underlying aetiology.\n\n【36】CTPA shows dilated and hypertrophied right ventricle with reversal of septal curvature and an enlarged right atrium with compression of the under-filled left atrium. There is eccentric thrombus with peripheral calcification in the dilated right and left main pulmonary arteries. Associated with this finding is proximal vessel narrowing of the lingula, a reduction in vascularity of the RML, and vessel attenuation of the medial left lower lobe artery. Eccentric lining thrombus is also evident in one of the right lower lobe segmental vessels. The lung windows demonstrate paraseptal and centrilobular emphysema with upper lobe predominance.\n\n【37】Selected views from a catheter pulmonary angiogram shows eccentric intimal thrombus in the right main PA, extending in to the right lower lobe. There is a pouch defect with complete occlusion of the middle lobe. Proximal webs are present in segmental right upper lobe. The anterior, posterior and lateral basal segments of the right lower lobe are occluded. There is stenosis with post stenotic dilatation of medial branch of the right lower lobe. On the left, there is intimal thrombus in main PA and left lower lobe vessel where there is a proximal stenosis followed by post stenotic dilatation. The superior segment of the lower lobe is occluded and anterior and lateral segments are truncated. There is segmental web disease in the left upper lobe and truncated appearance to the lingular branches. A salient feature seen bilaterally is the extreme tortuosity of the vessels in general. This is seen in very longstanding PH. The known PA wall calcification is difficult to appreciate on the angiogram although there is excellent depiction of the vessel lumen, this is a well-recognized limitation of catheter angiography.\n\n【38】Clinical Comments\n-----------------\n\n【39】This case has features of severe pulmonary hypertensions secondary to very long standing chronic thromboembolic disease. Disease distribution is proximal and radiologically amenable to surgery but an important co-morbidity in the form of emphysema has been revealed on the thoracic CT. Patients with significant parenchymal lung disease derive little benefit from pulmonary endarterectomy, as revascularization of regions affected with either significant emphysema or interstitial lung disease can cause profound refractory hypoxemia and respiratory failure post-surgery 删除10：<u></u>. This observation has resulted in one of the maxims of PTE surgery… “never attempt to reperfuse bad lung” (also see Chap. 19 ). An exception to this rule is when the emphysema is limited to the upper lobes and chronic thromboembolic disease involves vessels supplying preserved lung parenchyma. Surgery in this situation has the potential to be beneficial as there will be improvement in matching ventilation and perfusion. One should however be very careful when assessing the emphysema severity. CT has been extensively validated as a tool for assessment of the presence, pattern, and severity of emphysema. But it should be remembered that visual quantification of emphysema burden on CT scan is a weak predictor of lung function and individuals with similar levels of physiological impairment may have very different CT appearances. Hence, it is important to complement the CT changes with objectives measures of lung function. Consequently, though this patient’s history was compelling for recurrent pulmonary embolic events, and his radiographic studies showed evidence for operable chronic thromboembolic disease, the extent of his air flow obstruction, his parenchymal lung disease, and other comorbidities made it unlikely thromboendarterectomy alone would result in meaningful clinical improvement.\n\n【40】Point of Emphasis\n-----------------\n\n【41】The presence of operable chronic thromboembolic disease does not by itself establish the surgical candidacy of a patient for pulmonary thromboendarterectomy. A consideration of comorbidities and an assessment that there’s a high likelihood of achieving a favorable outcome need to factored in the decision to proceed with PTE surgery.\n\n【42】Diagnosis\n---------\n\n【43】1.  1.\n\n【44】    Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension with decompensated right heart failure.\n\n【45】2.  2.\n\n【46】    Centriacinar and paraseptal COPD—BODE index of 6.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 14:23:07", "endTime": "2024/09/12 14:23:55", "cost": 48.59}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:26", "update_time": "2024-09-11 22:23:54", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 22:23:05"}

High operation or McEvedy’s operation — \n\n【31】approach is made mainly above the inguinal canal but 删除换行 also below it.\n\n【32】2. Lotheissen’s operation — the approach is through  删除换行 the inguinal canal.\n\n【33】3. Lockwood operation — the approach is below the  删除换行 inguinal ligament via a groin-crease incision.\n\n【34】FEMORAL HERNIA\n\n【35】This operation gives  删除换行 a much better access than the ‘low’ operation. This  删除换行 operation is considered to be the best in strangulated  删除换行 hernia. It allows the sac to be dealt at the fundus as well  删除换行 as at the neck. It is a more time consuming operation  删除换行 than its ‘low’ counterpart.\n\n【36】A vertical incision is made over the femoral canal  删除换行 extending upwards above the inguinal ligament for about 删除换行 3 inches. The upper part of the incision lies Vi inch medial  删除换行 to the linea semilunaris. This part of the incision is  删除换行 deepened, the anterior rectus sheath is incised and the  删除换行 rectus muscle’ is retracted medially. The fascia transversalis  删除换行 is divided and by working downwards the sac entering  删除换行 the femoral canal is identified. In most cases the sac  删除换行 remains empty and is drawn upwards. The neck of the  删除换行 sac is ligatured and the sac is excised. In irreducible or 删除换行 strangulated hernia, the lower part of the incision is  删除换行 deepened first till the fundus of the sac is reached. The  删除换行 sac is then opened, its contents are dealt with, after which  删除换行 the upper part of the incision is deepened in the similar  删除换行 way as has been described earlier and the neck of the sac  删除换行 is drawn upwards through the canal.\n\n【37】The repair is now effected by suturing the conjoined  删除换行 tendon with the ligament of Cooper.\n\n【38】This operation 删除换行 is widely practised, the advantage being that the sac can  删除换行 be removed flush with the perietal peritoneum.\n\n【39】The incision is made similar to that used for inguinal  删除换行 hernia, except for the fact that it is placed nearer to the  删除换行 inguinal ligament. The external aponeurosis is incised and  删除换行 the inguinal canal is opened. The spermatic cord or the  删除换行 round ligament is retracted upwards. The conjoined  删除换行 muscles are also drawn upwards. The fascia transversalis  删除换行 is divided more or less in the same plane of incision. This  删除换行 incision should not be extended laterally upto the  删除换行 midinguinal point to avoid injury to the inferior epigastric  删除换行 vessels. The inferior margin of the wound is also retracted  删除换行 downards and the extra-peritoneal fat is pushed aside by  删除换行 gauze to expose the hernial sac entering the femoral canal. \n\n【40】If the sac is empty and is not adherent to the surrounding  删除换行 structures, it should be drawn up, the neck is ligatured  删除换行 and the rest of the sac is excised. Sometimes the sac  删除换行 remains adherent and the urinary bladder may adhere to  删除换行 the medial side of the sac. These have to be carefullyHERNIA\n\n【41】dissected off. To clear the fundus of the sac properly, the  删除换行 lower margin of the wound has to be retracted  删除换行 downwards.\n\n【42】The femoral ring is now obliterated by stitching the  删除换行 conjoined tendon or the inguinal ligament down to the  删除换行 pectineal ligament. This suturing is done by three sutures  删除换行 of the non-absorbable suture material. While the sutures  删除换行 are being applied, care must be taken to protect the  删除换行 femoral vein by pushing it laterally with a finger. When  删除换行 the femoral ring is very much widened and flabby, one  删除换行 can even use a fascial strip from external oblique  删除换行 aponeurosis to ‘darn’ the opening. Now the weakness in  删除换行 the posterior wall of the inguinal canal has to be repaired. \n\n【43】The cord or the round ligament of the uterus are placed  删除换行 in their positions and the external oblique aponeurosis is  删除换行 sutured as usual. Finally the skin is sutured.\n\n【44】This operation is less  删除换行 time consuming. But the main problem of this operation  删除换行 is that the neck of the sac cannot be reached properly, so  删除换行 proper repair of the femoral ring is not possible and this  删除换行 may well give rise to recurrence.\n\n【45】The incision is made along the groin-crease about Vi 删除换行 inch below the inguinal ligament. The various fatty layers  删除换行 ire incised including the thinned-cut cribriform fascia \n\n【46】:o expose the fundus of the sac. It is freed by gauze  删除换行 dissection as high up as to its neck, if possible. The fundus \n\n【47】}f the sac is opened and any contents therein, are pushed  删除换行 nto the abdominal cavity. If greater omentum remains  删除换行 tttached to the sac, this portion has to be excised. After  删除换行 nolding the opened sac by 2 or 3 pairs of artery forceps,  删除换行 i transfixation ligature is applied to the sac as high as  删除换行 jossible. The sac is now resected a little below the ligature,  删除换行 rhe stump will automatically retract and will disappear.\n\n【48】The closure is made by 2 or 3 stitches which pick up  删除换行 he fasciae forming the floor and the lateral margin of \n删除26：<u>;</u>aphenous opening. Care must be taken not to injure the \n\n【49】Jemoral vein which is proteced by a finger placed on it.\n\n【50】Strangulated femoral hernia.— The high operation\n\n【51】SU RGICAL ANATOMY.—\n\n【52】删除5：<u>213</u>\nof McEvedy is always preferable. At first, the sac is cleared  删除换行 and the fundus is opened. The contents are inspected. \n\n【53】The femoral ring is now exposed above the inguinal  删除换行 ligament and the constriction is investigated. This may  删除换行 be due to narrowness of the sac itself or from the tough  删除换行 boundaries of the femoral ring. In the latter case, first  删除换行 the lacunar ligament should be incised. Even if an  删除换行 abnormal obturator artery be present, it will be seen  删除换行 from above and can be avoided. Sometimes the inguinal  删除换行 ligament has to be cut to relieve the constriction. No  删除换行 harm is done by cutting the inguinal ligament as it can  删除换行 be sutured afterwards. The neck of the sac is divided  删除换行 against a grooved director. The contents are now drawn  删除换行 above the inguinal ligament and are dealt with  删除换行 accordingly. The hernia is of Richter’s type, when a portion  删除换行 of the circumference of the bowel herniates through the  删除换行 femoral ring and may be strangulated. After the contents  删除换行 of the sac have been dealt with properly, the closure is  删除换行 done as has been described in non-strangulated type of  删除换行 operation.\n\n【54】CLINICAL FEATURES.—\nThree types of umbilical hernia are seen in surgical  删除换行 practice :—\n\n【55】i.

Lockwood operation — the approach is below the  删除换行 inguinal ligament via a groin-crease incision.\n\n【34】FEMORAL HERNIA\n\n【35】This operation gives  删除换行 a much better access than the ‘low’ operation. This  删除换行 operation is considered to be the best in strangulated  删除换行 hernia. It allows the sac to be dealt at the fundus as well  删除换行 as at the neck. It is a more time consuming operation  删除换行 than its ‘low’ counterpart.\n\n【36】A vertical incision is made over the femoral canal  删除换行 extending upwards above the inguinal ligament for about 删除换行 3 inches. The upper part of the incision lies Vi inch medial  删除换行 to the linea semilunaris. This part of the incision is  删除换行 deepened, the anterior rectus sheath is incised and the  删除换行 rectus muscle’ is retracted medially. The fascia transversalis  删除换行 is divided and by working downwards the sac entering  删除换行 the femoral canal is identified. In most cases the sac  删除换行 remains empty and is drawn upwards. The neck of the  删除换行 sac is ligatured and the sac is excised. In irreducible or 删除换行 strangulated hernia, the lower part of the incision is  删除换行 deepened first till the fundus of the sac is reached. The  删除换行 sac is then opened, its contents are dealt with, after which  删除换行 the upper part of the incision is deepened in the similar  删除换行 way as has been described earlier and the neck of the sac  删除换行 is drawn upwards through the canal.\n\n【37】The repair is now effected by suturing the conjoined  删除换行 tendon with the ligament of Cooper.\n\n【38】This operation 删除换行 is widely practised, the advantage being that the sac can  删除换行 be removed flush with the perietal peritoneum.\n\n【39】The incision is made similar to that used for inguinal  删除换行 hernia, except for the fact that it is placed nearer to the  删除换行 inguinal ligament. The external aponeurosis is incised and  删除换行 the inguinal canal is opened. The spermatic cord or the  删除换行 round ligament is retracted upwards. The conjoined  删除换行 muscles are also drawn upwards. The fascia transversalis  删除换行 is divided more or less in the same plane of incision. This  删除换行 incision should not be extended laterally upto the  删除换行 midinguinal point to avoid injury to the inferior epigastric  删除换行 vessels. The inferior margin of the wound is also retracted  删除换行 downards and the extra-peritoneal fat is pushed aside by  删除换行 gauze to expose the hernial sac entering the femoral canal. \n\n【40】If the sac is empty and is not adherent to the surrounding  删除换行 structures, it should be drawn up, the neck is ligatured  删除换行 and the rest of the sac is excised. Sometimes the sac  删除换行 remains adherent and the urinary bladder may adhere to  删除换行 the medial side of the sac. These have to be carefullyHERNIA\n\n【41】dissected off. To clear the fundus of the sac properly, the  删除换行 lower margin of the wound has to be retracted  删除换行 downwards.\n\n【42】The femoral ring is now obliterated by stitching the  删除换行 conjoined tendon or the inguinal ligament down to the  删除换行 pectineal ligament. This suturing is done by three sutures  删除换行 of the non-absorbable suture material. While the sutures  删除换行 are being applied, care must be taken to protect the  删除换行 femoral vein by pushing it laterally with a finger. When  删除换行 the femoral ring is very much widened and flabby, one  删除换行 can even use a fascial strip from external oblique  删除换行 aponeurosis to ‘darn’ the opening. Now the weakness in  删除换行 the posterior wall of the inguinal canal has to be repaired. \n\n【43】The cord or the round ligament of the uterus are placed  删除换行 in their positions and the external oblique aponeurosis is  删除换行 sutured as usual. Finally the skin is sutured.\n\n【44】This operation is less  删除换行 time consuming. But the main problem of this operation  删除换行 is that the neck of the sac cannot be reached properly, so  删除换行 proper repair of the femoral ring is not possible and this  删除换行 may well give rise to recurrence.\n\n<mark>【45】The incision is made along the groin-crease about Vi 删除换行 inch below the inguinal ligament. The various fatty layers  删除换行 ire incised including the thinned-cut cribriform fascia\n\n【46】😮 expose the fundus of the sac. It is freed by gauze  删除换行 dissection as high up as to its neck, if possible. The fundus\n\n【47】}f the sac is opened and any contents therein, are pushed  删除换行 nto the abdominal cavity. If greater omentum remains  删除换行 tttached to the sac, this portion has to be excised. After  删除换行 nolding the opened sac by 2 or 3 pairs of artery forceps,  删除换行 i transfixation ligature is applied to the sac as high as  删除换行 jossible. The sac is now resected a little below the ligature,  删除换行 rhe stump will automatically retract and will disappear.</mark>r.\n\n【48】The closure is made by 2 or 3 stitches which pick up  删除换行 he fasciae forming the floor and the lateral margin of \n删除26：<u>;</u>aphenous opening. Care must be taken not to injure the \n\n【49】Jemoral vein which is proteced by a finger placed on it.\n\n【50】Strangulated femoral hernia.— The high operation\n\n【51】SU RGICAL ANATOMY.—\n\n【52】删除5：<u>213</u>\nof McEvedy is always preferable. At first, the sac is cleared  删除换行 and the fundus is opened. The contents are inspected. \n\n【53】The femoral ring is now exposed above the inguinal  删除换行 ligament and the constriction is investigated. This may  删除换行 be due to narrowness of the sac itself or from the tough  删除换行 boundaries of the femoral ring. In the latter case, first  删除换行 the lacunar ligament should be incised. Even if an  删除换行 abnormal obturator artery be present, it will be seen  删除换行 from above and can be avoided. Sometimes the inguinal  删除换行 ligament has to be cut to relieve the constriction. No  删除换行 harm is done by cutting the inguinal ligament as it can  删除换行 be sutured afterwards. The neck of the sac is divided  删除换行 against a grooved director. The contents are now drawn  删除换行 above the inguinal ligament and are dealt with  删除换行 accordingly. The hernia is of Richter’s type, when a portion  删除换行 of the circumference of the bowel herniates through the  删除换行 femoral ring and may be strangulated. After the contents  删除换行 of the sac have been dealt with properly, the closure is  删除换行 done as has been described in non-strangulated type of  删除换行 operation.\n\n【54】CLINICAL FEATURES.—\nThree types of umbilical hernia are seen in surgical  删除换行 practice :—\n\n【55】i. Exomphalos -— is a developmental anomaly due to  删除换行 failure of all or part of the midgut to return to the  删除换行 abdominal cavity during early foetal life. So the abdominal  删除换行 organs remain protruded being covered by a membrane\n\n【56】— which consists of an outer layer of amniotic membrane,  删除换行 a middle layer of Wharton’s Jelly and an inner layer of  删除换行 peritoneum. Two types of exomphalos can be seen —\n\n【57】(a) Exomphalos Minor— where the sac is relatively  删除换行 small and to its summit is attached the umbilical cord.\n\n【58】Treatment.— Sometimes just a twist to the cord may  删除换行 reduce the contents of the sac into the peritoneal cavity  删除换行 and this is retained by strapping applied firmly.

She went to see her general  删除换行 practitioner for an explanation. She has no history of trauma.

At the level of the distal palmar crease she has a nodule  删除换行 that is tender to palpation over the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint. On attempting to  删除换行 straighten the affected finger, a painful click is elicited when the finger is fully extended.\n删除3：<u>Figure 48.1 </u>\n\n【5】Questions:\n\n【6】• What is the diagnosis?\n\n【7】• How would you manage this condition?删除5：<u>132</u>\n删除7：<u>100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology</u>\nANSWER 48\n\n【8】The diagnosis is ‘trigger finger’, a name chosen because typically the finger suddenly  删除换行 extends fully with a snap. It results from thickening of the flexor tendon within the distal  删除换行 aspect of the palm. The gliding of the flexor tendon within the tendon sheath is affected. \n\n【9】This results in abrupt flexion of the finger. There is often tenderness over the A1 pulley \n\n【10】(a fibrous structure located at the MCP joint through which the flexor tendon passes) and  删除换行 intermittent restriction to flexion and extension of the finger. A nodule may develop on  删除换行 the tendon causing the tendon to get stuck in the pulley when attempting to extend the  删除换行 digit. Trigger digits are most commonly seen in adults aged between 50 and 60 years, and  删除换行 less commonly can be seen in congenital cases affecting the thumb in children.\n\n【11】In the majority of cases a steroid infiltration into the affected tendon sheath can give  删除换行 symptomatic relief. Splinting of the finger can help in reducing inflammation. Digits that  删除换行 fail to respond to two or three injections may benefit from surgery. Surgical release of the \n\n【12】A1 flexor pulley will allow the inflamed tendon to pass through and relieve symptoms. \n\n【13】Congenital cases do not respond to injections and require surgical intervention.\n\n【14】KEY POINTS\n\n【15】• Gliding of the flexor tendon within the tendon sheath is affected in trigger finger.\n\n【16】• Often there is tenderness over the A1 pulley.

He describes baseline CCS class 3 angina symptoms despite appropriate medical therapy， and his physical examination is remarkable for pallor， tachycardia， an S3 gallop， and faint rales in the lung bases. His ECG reveals sinus tachycardia with inferior Q waves and 2-mm horizontal ST seg-ment depression in the precordial leads. Following transfusion and resuscita-tion with intravenous fluids， he has an endoscopy that reveals a large duodenal ulcer with a visibly bleeding vessel that cannot be controlled by endoscopic therapy.

High risk for major cardiovascular complications； proceed with surgery immediately.\n\n【8】B.High risk for major cardiovascular complications； consider coronary angiogram prior to surgery to define his coronary anatomy.\n\n【9】C. High risk for major cardiovascular complications； consider noninvasive myocardial perfusion imaging to assess his burden of ischemia prior to surgery.\n\n【10】D.High risk for major cardiovascular complications； double his home dose of carvedilol to lower his cardiac risk and proceed with surgery.\n\n【11】E.High risk for major cardiovascular complications； recommend medical management only.\n\n【12】24.3 Which ofthe following statements regarding stress testing prior to noncardiac surgery is most accurate?\n\n【13】A.

History of atrial fibrillation. Although atrial fibrillation with an uncon-trolled ventricular rate would be considered a major clinical risk predictor， a history of atrial fibrillation alone is not associated with an increased risk for perioperative cardiac events. Ischemic heart disease， heart failure， insulin-requiring diabetes， and moderate chronic kidney disease are all associated with increased operative risk and are features ofthe revised cardiac risk index.\n\n【26】24.2 A. High risk for major cardiovascular complications； proceed with surgery immediately. This patient is experiencing a major gastrointestinal bleed that has failed endoscopic therapy. He carries a high risk of death due to exsan-guination without surgery that certainly exceeds his cardiac risk related to surgery， even in the face of major risk predictors such as severe chronic angina and features of decompensated heart failure. Coronary angiography is not indicated because this patient is not an appropriate candidate for percutane-ous or surgical coronary revascularization. Noninvasive imaging is not indi-cated because his cardiac risk is already obviously high and the results of the study will not change management. Although beta-blockers are indicated for the management of heart failure and angina， it would be contraindicated to escalate beta-blocker therapy in a hypotensive patient in shock. Avoiding sur-gery would likely carry a mortality risk related to bleeding that is greater than the mortality related to cardiac causes.\n\n【27】24.3 3(C. A normal noninvasive test for myocardial ischemia has excellent nega-tive predictive value for postoperative cardiac events. Studies comparing nuclear to echocardiographic assessment of ischemia have demonstrated no clear superiority of either modality， but exercise stress is generally considered superior to pharmacologic stimulation. Although many patients with moder-ate-risk predictors and low functional class might benefit from additional risk stratification， noninvasive studies should be performed only if the results are likely to change management， and this is clearly not the case for every patient. Abnormal imaging studies have relatively poor positive predictive value for postoperative cardiac events.\n\n【28】24.4A. First-degree AV block with a PR interval of 230 ms. High-grade AV block is considered a major clinical risk marker and includes Mobitz type 2second-degree AV block and third-degree AV block. Severe aortic stenosis， decompensated heart failure， recent myocardial infarction， and uncontrolled tachyarrhythmias are all major clinical risk indicators.\n\n【29】CUNICALPEARLS\n\n【30】Clinical risk assessment tools such as the revised cardiac risk index can accurately estimate the risk for adverse cardiac events in most patients.\n\n【31】C Noninvasive assessment for myocardial ischemia is appropriate for moderate-risk patients with poor functional status or high-risk patients undergoing moderate- or high-risk surgeries if the results will influence management.\n\n【32】C (Coronary angiography and revascularization is indicated in preoperative patients who have a separate and clear indication for revascularization that is independent from their need for risk stratification.\n\n【33】CFPreoperative beta-blocker therapy is recommended only in patients who have an independent indication for beta-blocker treatment.

More  删除换行 common ocular conditions, such as glaucoma and vitreous detachment, should be con删除8：<u>￾</u>sidered too. The fundoscopy findings of haemorrhage and infarction (often described as  删除换行 a ‘pizza’ appearance) are typical for CMV retinitis.\n\n【13】The majority of people in the UK have been infected at some point with CMV and are  删除换行 usually asymptomatic from this. Immunocompromised patients are at risk of develop删除8：<u>￾</u>ing severe CMV infections, with pathologies such as pneumonitis, gastritis, colitis and  删除换行 retinitis developing. CMV retinitis is an inflammation of the retina that often starts with  删除换行 symptoms of visual blurring and can rapidly progress to permanent visual loss if not  删除换行 treated urgently.\n\n【14】This man is at risk of CMV retinitis because he is immunocompromised from the HIV \n\n【15】infection. His CD4 count has been low recently, which would put him at increased risk  删除换行 of opportunistic infections. He has recently commenced HAART, and around 4–12 weeks  删除换行 after commencing HAART some patients develop immune reconstitution inflammatory  删除换行 syndrome (IRIS), in which a rapid drop in the patient’s viral load causes the immune sys删除8：<u>￾</u>tem to recover and mount a strong response to a previously acquired infection.

The family immigrated to the United States from Guatemala 3 years previously. Her mother reports the girl seems very small for her age and has been continually lethargic for quite some time. Physical examination reveals a small girl with a thin， scaphoid abdomen. Relevant laboratory findings are as follows：\n\n【2】Hematocrit： 36%\n\n【3】Mean corpuscular volume： 73 fL\n\n【4】WBC count： 11，000/mm²\n\n【5】Differential： 35% segmented cells， 1% bands， 33% lymphocytes，21% eosinophils\n\n【6】What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【7】Hookworm， or nematode， infection. The findings of eosinophilia and microcytic anemia with recent immigration from an endemic area are highly suggestive of this condition.\n\n【8】What is the next step in confirming the diagnosis?\n\n【9】Stool ova and parasite tests can confirm the presence of characteristic small， round eggs and occasional worms approximately 1 cm in size. Stool ova and parasite tests can also be used to delineate the species of helminth.\n\n【10】What are the species of hookworms? Ancylostoma duodenale， Necator americanus， and Ancylostoma braziliense are the most common hookworms. Of the three， A duodenale and N americanus cause the classic gastrointestinal symptoms and microcytic anemia seen in this patient. A braziliense， however， can manifest as a condition known as cutaneous larva migrans， in which the larva migrate to the subcutaneous tissue and create pruritic， serpiginous tracts underneath the skin.\n\n【11】What other helminth is known to cause anemia?\n\n【12】Diphyllobothrium latum， a tapeworm， causes vitamin B，deficiency leading to a macrocytic anemia.\n\n【13】How does this infection cause disease in humans?\n\n【14】Percutaneous infection occurs generally through the soles of the feet and is acquired commonly from sandboxes. The larvae pass into the lungs， and 8-21 days later they cross the pulmonary vasculature and enter the airways. They ascend to the pharynx and are swallowed. By the time they reach the small intestine， the larvae have become adult worms. The adults \"hook\" onto the mucosa and feed on the host's blood with the help of an orally secreted factor X inhibitor. This results in the microcytic anemia. The females produce eggs that are passed through the stool and deposited in the soil.\n\n【15】What are the appropriate treatments for this condition?\n\n【16】Since hookworm is a helminthic infection， mebendazole and albendazole are the first-line agents. These agents disrupt helminthic microtubule synthesis， leading to structural weakening and death of helminthic cells. Pyrantel pamoate can be used as a second-line agent.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 14:05:15", "endTime": "2024/09/12 14:05:52", "cost": 37.223}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:26", "update_time": "2024-09-11 22:05:52", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 22:05:15"}

GERD increases the risk of developing esophageal mucosal metaplasia (squamous is replaced by columnar), called Barrett esophagus. In turn, patients with Barrett esophagus are at increased risk for developing adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus. Barrett esophagus is diagnosed by endoscopy, and must be followed with annual endoscopy and biopsy to monitor for adenocarcinoma.  \n\n【7】Answer B is incorrect . Stomach cell adenocarcinoma is not associated with GERD. Risk factors for gastric adenocarcinoma include Helicobacter pylori infection, nitrosamine exposure, excessive salt intake, and low intake of fresh fruits and vegetables. This type of carcinoma is predisposed by achlorhydria and chronic gastritis. Alarming signs and symptoms of gastric adenocarcinoma include unexplained weight loss, persistent vomiting, dysphagia, family history of upper GI tract cancer, left supraclavicular adenopathy, and hematemesis. Current treatment of gastric adenocarcinoma consists of different multidrug therapies with agents such as 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, cisplatin, etoposide, and/or irinotecan.  \n\n【8】Answer C is incorrect . Krukenberg tumor is involvement of the ovaries (typically bilateral) by metastatic carcinoma of the stomach, intestines, or breasts. This neoplasm bears no relation to GERD nor is it possible for this male patient to have ovarian metastases assuming normal reproductive development. Patients with Krukenberg tumor might present with disproportionate abdominal pain, left supraclavicular adenopathy, bloody stools, iron deficiency anemia, palpable pelvic masses, and/or cystic masses on ultrasound. Current treatment includes obtaining a tissue diagnosis of the ovarian mass to differentiate primary from metastatic lesions. There is no agreed-upon medical treatment, but survival can be improved with bilateral oophrectomy if the metastasis is limited to the ovaries. This would accompany treatment of the underlying primary tumor.  \n\n【9】Answer D is incorrect . Non-small cell adenocarcinoma of the lung (NSCLC) is commonly caused by cigarette smoking but is not associated with GERD. A patient with NSCLC might present with hemoptysis, cough, chronic lung infections, history of smoking, chest wall pain, shortness of breath, and/or hoarseness. The only current treatment regimens for NSCLC that have proven to improve survival are the cisplatin-based regimens, which combine cisplatin with various other antineoplastic agents (eg, paclitaxel, docetaxel, gemcitabine, and vinorelbine).  \n\n【10】Answer E is incorrect . Squamous cell carcinoma is not known to correlate with GERD. Squamous cell carcinoma is thought to be associated with tobacco and alcohol use. It tends to involve the proximal and mid-sections of the esophagus rather than the distal esophagus. Combination therapy with 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin is currently the mainstay of treatment in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 11:40:24", "endTime": "2024/09/12 11:51:37", "cost": 672.405}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:26", "update_time": "2024-09-11 19:51:37", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 19:40:24"}

The patient’s mother states that he has had dry scaly skin for most of his life, but it has never been as severe as this. She also notes a birthing history of prolonged labor, resulting in cesarean section.

What other conditions should the patient’s pediatrician screen for?\n\n【7】iv. How is this condition treated?\n\n【8】Answer 88\n\n【9】i. This patient presents with steroid sulfatase deficiency, also known as X-linked recessive ichthyosis. Along with ichthyosis vulgaris, steroid sulfatase deficiency is one of the more common ichthyoses with an estimated incidence of 1 in 2000 to 9500 male births. Seen almost exclusively in males, it is caused by a deletion or inactivating mutation of the entire STS gene on chromosome X, leading to the absence of or marked decrease in steroid sulfatase activity and subsequent inability to hydrolyze cholesterol sulfate and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS). Impaired hydrolysis leads to accumulation of cholesterol 3-sulfate in the epidermis, which inhibits transglutaminase-1, leading to abnormal cornification and clinical scaling of the skin.\n\n【10】In the neonatal period, steroid sulfatase deficiency may present with mild erythroderma followed by peeling of large translucent scales. As infants grow older, they develop darker brown or characteristically ‘dirty’ appearing polygonal scales that almost always involve the neck and often involve the trunk and extremities. Flexural areas are often spared. Unlike ichthyosis vulgaris, this condition does not typically improve with age.\n\n【11】ii. Prolonged labor or failure to initiate labor can be seen in women with an affected fetus. Steroid sulfatase deficiency in the placenta can cause low or absent levels of estrogen in the urine and amniotic fluid, which causes insufficient dilation of the cervix, often requiring cesarean section for delivery.\n\n【12】iii. Patients with steroid sulfatase deficiency have a 20-fold increased incidence of cryptorchidism and have a higher risk for developing testicular cancer and hypogonadism. Asymptomatic corneal opacities can be seen in up to 50% of patients, and other rare associated non-cutaneous findings include seizures, developmental delay and acute lymphoblastic leukemia.\n\n【13】iv.

This patient has an elevated serum calcium level and low phosphate level， which are likely due to an elevated parathyroid level. An asymptomatic and likely chronically elevated calcium level is most likely caused by primary hyperparathyroidism due to a parathyroid adenoma. The hypercalcemia is presumed to be chronic because she has osteoporosis and is premenopausal.\n\n【25】Multiple myeloma (answer A) usually leads to elevated calcium and phos-phate levels and lytic lesions of the bones. Familial hypocalciuric hypercal-cemia (answer C) can also lead to elevated serum calcium and low serum phosphate levels， but it is usually asymptomatic and is far rarer than primary hyperparathyroidism. Sarcoidosis (answer D) is a granulomatous disease that is associated with an elevated calcitriol production leading to increased serum calcium and phosphate as well as increased 1，25(OH)， vitamin D； osteopo-rosis is not seen. Undiagnosed breast cancer (answer E) with metastases to the bones can lead to elevated serum calcium and phosphate levels； this is less likely.\n\n【26】50.2 A. Bisphosphonates are helpful in controlling hypercalcemia through inhibi-tion of osteoclastic bone reabsorption. Dexamethasone， in combination with thalidomide (answer C)， is useful in treatment of the myeloma， with a slower effect on the calcium level. Erythropoietin (answer B) is inappropriate and is used to increase synthesis of red blood cells in those with renal failure. Interferon-alpha (answer D) is also not a treatment for hypercalcemia but is used for some cancers such as kidney， melanoma， carcinoid， and some lympho-mas. Though the patient has no symptoms， observing alone (answer E) is not appropriate in presence of hypercalcemia.\n\n【27】50.3 A. Both sarcoidosis and lymphoma can present with cough， dyspnea， and hilar adenopathy on chest x-ray. In approximately 10% of cases， sarcoidosis can cause elevated calcium levels through the production of 1，25-vitamin D that occurs in the macrophages of the granulomas. This can also be seen in granulomas caused by tuberculosis and in lymphoma. Leukemia (answer C) usually does not present in this manner， although it can cause hypercalcemia. Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (answer D) would be unusual in a patient of this age， and the radiographic presentation is atypical. The case scenario is consistent with Lofgren syndrome， an acute presentation of sarcoidosis， which includes hilar adenopathy， erythema nodosum， migratory polyarthral-gia， and fever， seen most often in women. Neither pneumonia (answer B) nor pulmonary embolism (answer E) is associated with hypercalcemia.\n\n【28】50.4 D. Although all of the other therapies listed may be helpful in the treatment of hypercalcemia， given the clinical findings of dehydration and elevated creatinine level with a history of previously normal renal function， volume expansion with normal saline would correct the dehydration and presumed prerenal azotemia， allowing the kidneys to more efficiently excrete calcium. Other therapies (answers A， B， C， E) can be added if the response to normal saline alone is insufficient.\n\n【29】CLINICAL PEARLS\n\n【30】Hypercalcemia that is acutely symptomatic is most likely caused by cancer.\n\n【31】Asymptomatic hypercalcemia is mostlikely C causedby primary hyperparathyroidism.\n\n【32】In primary hyperparathyroidism， serum PTH and calcium levels are ele-vated， and phosphate levels are decreased.

This cross-reactivity explains why relatively long-acting benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam, chlordiazepoxide) can be substituted for alcohol in a detoxification program.\n\n【13】#### CLINICAL CORRELATION\n\n【14】Ethanol is the most widely used CNS depressant. It is rapidly absorbed from the stomach and small intestine and distributed in total body water. Its exact mechanism of action is not known, but may be related to its generally disruptive effects on cell membrane protein functions throughout the body, including effects on signaling pathways in the CNS. At low doses it is oxidized by cytoplasmic alcohol dehydrogenase. At higher doses it is also oxidized by liver microsomal enzymes, which may be induced by chronic use. These enzymes are rapidly saturated by the concentrations of alcohol achieved by even one or two alcoholic drinks so that its rate of metabolism becomes independent of plasma concentration. Tolerance to the intoxicating effects of alcohol can develop with chronic use. Genetic variations in aldehyde dehydrogenase occur such that certain individuals display impaired ability to metabolize alcohol. The acetaldehyde metabolite accumulates in these individuals causing demonstrate a characteristic flushing of the skin upon drinking alcohol and increasing the likelihood of acute alcohol intoxication.\n\n【15】Cross-tolerance with barbiturates and benzodiazepines may also develop. Because of this cross-tolerance effect, benzodiazepines are the most commonly used agents for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal, a potentially life-threatening syndrome commonly seen 2–3 days after the abrupt cessation of alcohol use by a chronic abuser. A long-acting benzodiazepine can be taken, and gradually tapered, to mitigate this effect. Disulfiram is also used on occasion to manage alcoholism. It is a drug that inhibits aldehyde dehydrogenase that in the presence of alcohol causes an accumulation of acetaldehyde, which results in a highly aversive reaction consisting of flushing, severe headache, nausea and vomiting, and confusion. Naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, is yet another drug used to manage alcoholism.\n\n【16】APPROACH TO:\n\n【17】Pharmacology of Drugs of Abuse\n\n【18】#### OBJECTIVES\n\n【19】1\\. Define drug abuse, drug tolerance, drug dependence, and drug addiction.\n\n【20】2\\. List the common drugs of abuse and their properties.\n\n【21】3\\. List the adverse effects of the common drugs of abuse.\n\n【22】4\\. Describe pharmacological treatment of alcohol and nicotine addiction.\n\n【23】#### DEFINITIONS\n\n【24】Drug abuse: Nonmedical use of a drug taken to alter consciousness or to change body image that is often regarded as unacceptable by society. Not to be confused with drug misuse.\n\n【25】Drug tolerance: Decreased response to a drug with its continued administration that can be overcome by increasing the dose. A cellular tolerance develops to certain drugs of abuse that act on the CNS because of a poorly understood biochemical or homeostatic adaptation of neurons to the continued presence of the drug. Also, in addition to a cellular tolerance, a metabolic tolerance can develop to the effects of some drugs because they increase the synthesis of enzymes responsible for their own metabolism (alcohol, barbiturates).\n\n【26】Drug dependence: Continued need of the user to take a drug. Psychologic dependence is the compulsive behavior of a user to continue to use a drug, no matter the personal or medical consequences. Inability to obtain the drug activates a “craving” that is very discomforting. Physical or physiologic dependence is a consequence of drug abstinence after chronic drug use that results in a constellation of signs and symptoms that are often opposite to the initial effects of the drug and to those sought by the user. Psychologic dependence generally precedes physical dependence but, depending on the drug, does not necessarily lead to it. The development of physical dependence, the degree of which varies considerably for different drugs of abuse, is always associated with the development of tolerance, although the exact relationship is unclear.\n\n【27】Drug addiction: A poorly defined, imprecise term with little clinical significance that indicates the presence of psychologic and physical dependence.\n\n【28】#### DISCUSSION\n\n【29】##### Class\n\n【30】In addition to alcohol, the major drugs of abuse are nicotine, marijuana (Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol), and the CNS stimulants, notably cocaine and amphetamine and its derivatives .\n删除4：<u>Table 23–1 • DRUGS OF ABUSE</u>\n\n【31】Three agents are approved for the pharmacological management of alcohol abuse. Disulfiram inhibits aldehyde dehydrogenase to increase the accumulation of acetaldehyde. Exposure to alcohol in the presence of this drug causes flushing, headache, palpitations, nausea/vomiting, and decreased blood pressure. These adverse reactions can discourage impulsive alcohol consumption. Naltrexone blocks the μ-opioid receptor to decrease alcohol cravings. It may be most effective in those with a genetic predisposition to alcohol dependence. Its use is limited by potential liver toxicity. A depot preparation of this drug is available. Acamprosate modulates glutamate neurotransmission by acting at central metabotropic glutamate receptors. Although this drug is generally well tolerated, its effectiveness remains equivocal. It can be combined with naltrexone.\n\n【32】Nicotine replacement for smoking cessation is available in patch, gum, inhaler, lozenge, and nasal spray. Patch provides a continuous supply of nicotine, whereas the other routes of administration provide the opportunity for the patient to respond to cravings. Patch, gum, and lozenges are available over the counter, whereas the inhaler and nasal spray require a prescription. Although nicotine is a vasoconstrictor, its use in smoking cessation is safe even in patients with cardiovascular disease. Varenicline is a partial agonist for nicotinic cholinoreceptor. Its partial agonist properties reduce nicotine withdrawal. By occupying the nicotinic cholinoreceptor, it prevents binding of nicotine to block the “reward” of smoking. Bupropion is an antidepressant that affects norepinephrine and dopamine systems. Its effectiveness in smoking cessation is independent of its antidepressant effects. Side effects include insomnia, agitation, and, rarely, seizures.\n\n【33】####", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 11:37:24", "endTime": "2024/09/12 11:37:38", "cost": 14.293}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:26", "update_time": "2024-09-11 19:37:39", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 19:37:24"}

Anger\n\n【2】B. Scorn\n\n【3】C. Shame\n\n【4】D. Confusion\n\n【5】Answer: 18.1 C. Because the culture of medical training and practice emphasizes perfection, there is often an intense feeling of shame when a clinician has been involved in an event that caused patient harm. This may be accompanied by fear of loss of the patient’s trust, damaged reputation among colleagues, and possible litigation.\n\n【6】Question: 18.2 Which of the following is the best approach in disclosure conversations with patients and their families?\n\n【7】A. The use of medical terminology is generally more precise than lay language.\n\n【8】B. When asked why a complication occurred, speculation is wise because it indicates transparency.\n\n【9】C. The physician should allow conversational space for the reactions of the patient and the family.\n\n【10】D. It is best not to give specific details about what we know went wrong because this confuses patients and puts the clinician at risk for malpractice.\n\n【11】Answer: 18.2 C. Because of the complicated emotions affecting the clinician, there is sometimes an unconscious wish to obfuscate the details of what has gone wrong when discussing them with the patient. It is as if clinicians hope the patient will not understand that we have made an error. Sometimes, especially when pressed for answers by the patient or family, we hypothesize about why the error has occurred. It is a completely natural way for us to communicate; it is what we do when making a differential diagnosis.

Whoever caused the adverse event should be the one leading the disclosure conversation; this might be the resident or nurse.\n\n【14】B.

The initial disclosure conversation should not be held until all of the facts of the event are known.\nAnswer: 18.3 B. The conversation should ideally be led by the attending most involved with the patient. “I am sorry” is an expression of empathy. If the intent is to apologize, then a phrase such as “I am sorry we made this mistake” can be used. Patients sometimes forgive, but at other times they might feel angry, confused, or betrayed. One cannot ‘control’ the emotions of others. It is important to initiate a disclosure conversation as soon as possible after the event. At that point, one needs to disclose what is known thus far and then reassure the patient that clinicians will communicate with them when they have further information.\n\n【17】KEY POINTS\n\n【18】 It is important to initiate a disclosure conversation as soon as possible after the event.

Soon after a “night on the town,” she called her boyfriend saying that she took a handful of sleeping pills. On examination, she appears lethargic, but groans and moves all her extremities to painful stimuli. Her blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, heart rate is 80 bpm, and oxygen saturation is 99 percent. Her pupils are of normal size and reactive to light. Her deep tendon reflexes are normal bilaterally. In the field, she was given an intravenous bolus of dextrose and an ampule of naloxone without response. Her boyfriend, with whom she had an argument, brings in the bottle of sleeping medication, which reads “lorazepam.”\n\n【2】 What is the danger of an overdose with this class of medication?\n\n【3】 What is the cellular mechanism of action of this class of medication?\n\n【4】 What pharmacologic agent can be used to treat this patient, and what is its mechanism of action?\n\n【5】ANSWERS TO CASE 20:\n\n【6】Benzodiazepines\n\n【7】Summary : A 22-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of a suicide attempt overdose with lorazepam. She is hemodynamically stable, has no focal neurologic deficits, but is lethargic. Intravenous dextrose and naloxone have been given without response.\n\n【8】 Danger of an overdose with this class of medication: Lorazepam is a benzodiazepine that belongs to a class of agents known as sedative-hypnotics that can depress the activity of the central nervous system (CNS). An overdose of a benzodiazepine, particularly in the presence of another CNS depressant like alcohol, can lead to sedation, hypotension, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Benzodiazepine overdose, without alcohol or other depressant agents, is rarely fatal.\n\n【9】 Cellular mechanism of action of lorazepam: Binds to a distinct benzodiazepine receptor site on the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor–chloride channel complex to allosterically increase the affinity for and frequency of GABA interactions with neuronal GABA <sub>A </sub> receptors.\n\n【10】 Pharmacologic agent used to treat benzodiazepine overdose and its mechanism of action: Flumazenil is a competitive antagonist at benzodiazepine receptors. It is used clinically to reverse the symptoms of benzodiazepine overdose.\n\n【11】#### CLINICAL CORRELATION\n\n【12】This 22-year-old woman had likely been drinking, and subsequently ingested numerous tablets of lorazepam, a benzodiazepine; she exhibits the classic signs of overdose: drowsiness, confusion, and amnesia. In general, an overdose of benzodiazepines is not fatal, which is a major advantage over previous classes of drugs used for their sedative-hypnotic properties, such as the barbiturates. Symptoms of benzodiazepine overdose may include drowsiness, confusion, amnesia, hypotension, and, in the absence of compromised pulmonary function, mild respiratory depression. However, in the presence of other sedative-hypnotic agents like ethanol, which is suspected in this case, there may be enhanced sedation and respiratory depression that can result in coma and even death.\n\n【13】APPROACH TO:\n\n【14】Benzodiazepines\n\n【15】#### OBJECTIVES\n\n【16】1\\. Describe the mechanism of action of benzodiazepines.\n\n【17】2\\. Examine chronic use of benzodiazepines.\n\n【18】3\\. Identify the withdrawal symptoms of this class of drugs.\n\n【19】#### DEFINITIONS\n\n【20】GABA <sub>A </sub> receptor–chloride channel complex: A multi-unit protein that interacts with GABA to regulate chloride conductance. This action can be modified by the allosteric interaction of other substrates, such as the benzodiazepines and barbiturates.\n\n【21】Allosteric interaction: A conformational change of a protein (GABA <sub>A </sub> receptor–chloride channel complex) caused by noncompetitive binding of a substrate (benzodiazepine) at a site other than the active site of that protein.\n\n【22】#### DISCUSSION\n\n【23】Benzodiazepines are drugs used to treat a variety of disorders including, most notably, anxiety and insomnia, as well as seizures. They are also used clinically as muscle relaxants, as preanesthetic medications, and as amnestic agents for short medical and surgical procedures .\n删除4：<u>Table 20–1 • SELECTED CLINICAL USES OF BENZODIAZEPINES</u>\n\n【24】Chronic use (weeks) of the benzodiazepines can result in tolerance (a decreased response with continued drug administration) and physical dependence with an identifiable withdrawal syndrome that includes severe anxiety and insomnia and less frequently, as seen with alcohol withdrawal, tremulousness, tachycardia, hypertension, hallucinations, and seizures that can be life threatening. Withdrawal from shorter acting and intermediate-acting benzodiazepines occurs more quickly and is more severe than from longer acting drugs, and is usually managed with tapered dose reduction of the drug. Alternatively, because of the phenomenon of cross-tolerance, benzodiazepines with longer half-lives (eg, diazepam) can be substituted for shorter acting benzodiazepines or other sedative-hypnotic drugs, like ethanol and the barbiturates, to stabilize the patient and to reduce the severity of the withdrawal syndrome.\n\n【25】Zolpidem, zaleplon, and eszopiclone are structurally different than the benzodiazepines but have a similar mechanism of action. They are widely used for the short-term management of insomnia. They have few of the other actions of the benzodiazepines and are less likely to cause physical dependence and drug abuse.\n\n【26】Flumazenil, a competitive inhibitor of the benzodiazepine-binding site on the GABA <sub>A </sub> receptor–chloride channel complex, will quickly reverse the effects of the benzodiazepines. In dependent individuals it can induce symptoms of withdrawal. It is used to treat significant CNS depression because of benzodiazepine overdose such as in this clinical case.\n\n【27】##### Mechanism of Action\n\n【28】Like the barbiturates (another class of sedative-hypnotic agents), the benzodiazepines bind to the GABA <sub>A </sub> receptor–chloride channel complex . However, unlike the barbiturates, which increase the duration of GABA-mediated chloride channel opening, the benzodiazepines bind to a different site and act to increase the affinity of the complex for GABA. This results in increased chloride conductance resulting in neuronal hyperpolarization. Because GABA is the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter of the brain, its increased action, facilitated by a benzodiazepine, will lead to a reduced neuronal stimulation by excitatory neurotransmitters. The outcome, among others, is sedation and hypnosis.\n删除3：<u>Figure 20–1. Chloride channel showing benzodiazepine receptor on cell membrane. (Used, with permission, from Toy EC, Klamen DL. Case Files: Psychiatry, 2nd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2007:409.)</u>\n\n【29】Zolpidem, zaleplon, and eszopiclone act on a subtype of the benzodiazepine receptor (BZ1) and, like the benzodiazepines, reduce chloride conductance in the CNS.\n\n【30】Flumazenil competitively inhibits the action of benzodiazepines at their receptors on the GABA receptor–chloride channel complex.\n\n【31】##### Pharmacokinetics\n\n【32】Benzodiazepines are well absorbed from the GI tract, although clorazepate, a prodrug, is first decarboxylated in gastric juice to the long-acting (>50 hour) active metabolite N \\-desmethyldiazepam. Because the lipid solubility of the benzodiazepines varies more than 50-fold, there is considerable variation in their onset of action (diazepam, midazolam > lorazepam, clonazepam, alprazolam > oxazepam, temazepam).\n\n【33】Under most circumstances, the duration of action of the benzodiazepines  is related to their biotransformation by Dealkylation to the long acting (>50 hours) active metabolites desmethyldiazepam (eg, diazepam, chlordiazepoxide) or desalkylflurazepam (flurazepam).\n删除4：<u>Table 20–2 • SELECTED BENZODIAZEPINES</u>\n\n【34】Oxidation to short- or intermediate-acting metabolites (alprazolam, triazolam).\n\n【35】Rapid conjugation to metabolites with no intrinsic activity (eg, oxazepam, lorazepam).\n\n【36】Clearance of the benzodiazepines is decreased significantly in the elderly, or in patients with liver disease. Thus these populations should, in general, be administered reduced dosages. Elderly patients may also be susceptible to paradoxical agitation and insomnia. The benzodiazepines should be avoided in pregnancy because neonates may develop withdrawal symptoms.\n\n【37】####", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 14:11:36", "endTime": "2024/09/12 14:12:15", "cost": 39.321}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:26", "update_time": "2024-09-11 22:12:14", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 22:11:35"}

It may result from lesions of muscles， myoneural junctions or motor neurons of lips， tongue， palate and pharynx. Common causes include mechanical defects such as ill-fitting dentures or cleft palate. Dysarthria may also result from impaired hearing which begins in early childhood.\n\n【13】ADVANCED-LEVEL QUESTIONS\n\n【14】How would you test the different structures responsible for articulation?\n\n【15】● Lips： ask the patient to say， 'me， me， me'\n\n【16】Tongue： ask the patient to say， la， la， la’\n\n【17】Pharynx： ask the patient to say， kuh， gut'\n\n【18】Palate， larynx and expiratory muscles： ask the patient to say， ‘ah'. In palatal paralysis the patient's speech is worse when the head is bent forwards.\n\n【19】Artic tionn can also be tested by asking the patient to repeat t following：\n\n【20】British constitution：\n\n【21】Hippopotamus\n\n【22】Methodist episcopal\n\n【23】Constantinople is the capital of Turkey.\n\n【24】What do you understand by top of the basiliar' syndrome?\n\n【25】Emboli to the rostral portion of the basilar artery usually produce this syndrome， with a myraid of possible symptoms characterized by visual， 删除换行 oculomotor and behavioural abnormalities， often without significant motor dysfunction. A top of the basilar syndrome is characterized by som-nolence and sometimes， stupor； inability to make new memories； small， poorly reactive pupils； and defective vertical gaze. Patients with cerebellar infarcts often have dizziness， sometimes in conjunction with frank vertigo， blurred vision， difficulty walking and vomiting. These patients often veer to one side and cannot sit upright or maintain an erect posture without support. They may have hypotonia of the arm on the side of the infarct， a sign best elicited by having them hold their arms straight ahead and then rapidly lower them， quickly braking the movement. The hypotonic arm 1 1 overshoots on both descent and rapid ascent. Nystagmus is common. Patients with pure cerebellar infarcts do not have hemiparesis or hemisen-sory loss.\n\n【26】What parts of the brain does the vertebrobasilar artery supply?\n\n【27】The vertebrobasilar arterial supplies the brainstem (medulla， pons and midbrain)， cerebellum， occipital lobes， posterior temporal lobes and thalamus.\n\n【28】Remember： The vertebra-basiliar arterial system consists of the extrac-ranial and intracranial vertebral arteries； these unite to form the basilar artery， which runs midline along the ventral surface of the brainstem， feeding it with small， deep perforators until it merges with the circle of Willis to give off the posterior cerebral arteries.\n\n【29】What is the significance of anti-Yo antibodies in a patient with cerebellar syndrome?\n\n【30】The presence of anti-Yo antibodies in the serum of a woman with cerebellar symptoms is virtually conclusive evidence that she has paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration and gynaecologic， usually ovarian， cancer.\n\n【31】What is the role of chaperones in cerebellar tumours?\n\n【32】A chaperone complex (which typically maintains cellular protein assembly and function) mediates the assembly of the von Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor protein； when this protein is not assembled correctly， its tumour-suppressing activity is lost， permitting the development and growth of tumours. A mutation in or deletion of part of this tumour-suppressor protein is associated with von Hippel-Lindau disease (charac-terized by phaeochromocytoma， renal carcinoma and densely vascularized retinal and cerebellar tumours).\n\n【33】What is the role of Sonic hedgehog Shh pathway in pathogenesis of medulloblastoma?\n\n【34】Medulloblastoma arises through abnormalities of developmental path-ways in a population of progenitor cells. These tumours aberrantly express multiple regulatory genes known to mediate the proliferation of neural stem cells. Activity in the Shh pathway is important for the self-renewal of progenitor cells and the proliferation of their progeny， and also in the initiation of brain tumours. Medulloblastoma cells die rapidly when cul-tured with cyclopamine， an antagonist of the hedgehog family of regula-tory pathways.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 14:30:50", "endTime": "2024/09/12 14:33:55", "cost": 185.166}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:26", "update_time": "2024-09-11 22:33:55", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 22:30:50"}

Both the incisions  删除换行 are closed with or without drainage. During dissection one  删除换行 must be careful, as many important nerves and blood vessels,  删除换行 which have been discussed earlier, are around.\n\n【24】Complete removal is necessary to avoid recurrence.\n\n【25】BRANCHIAL FISTULA\n\n【26】This is a rare tumour which arises from the remnant of  删除换行 the branchial cleft. This is a deep-seated carcinoma with no  删除换行 other primary tumour ever discovered. As a matter of fact a  删除换行 clinical diagnosis of branchiogenic carcinoma is rarely justified  删除换行 until and unless one very clearly excludes primary growth in  删除换行 the mouth, tongue, pharynx, larynx and external auditory  删除换行 meatus. Again at times a primary carcinoma of the mouth  删除换行 or pharynx may remain silent for months, the only evidence  删除换行 of its presence being a deep-seated cervical lymph node.\n\n【27】This carcinoma is commoner in males and is situated  删除换行 deep in the neck near the bifurcation of the common carotid  删除换行 artery. It infiltrates the surrounding structures and  删除换行 metastasises to the regional lymph nodes. Microscopically, 删除换行 the tumour consists of squamous or transitional cells arranged  删除换行 in masses, in the centre of which cavities may appear due to  删除换行 necrosis. Lymphoid tissue may be seen here and there, as is  删除换行 seen in a branchial cyst.\n\n【28】PHARYNX\n\n【29】It is a cystic swelling which contains multiple locules of  删除换行 clear lymph.\n\n【30】SKIN\n\n【31】In human embryo at about the 6th week the lymph sacs  删除换行 develop six in number from which the lymph vessels are  删除换行 derived. One pair in the neck called jugular lymph sacs  删除换行 develop near the origin of the internal jugular vein. One at  删除换行 the retroperitoneal tissue and another lymph sac is called  删除换行 cysterna chyli. Another pair develops near the inguinal region  删除换行 below the bifurcation of the common iliac vein. This pair is  删除换行 called posterior lymph sac.\n\n【32】The jugular lymph sac is first to appear at the junction  删除换行 of the subclavian vein with the anterior cardinal vein which  删除换行 ultimately forms the jugular vein. Sequestration of a portion  删除换行 of the jugular sac from the lymphatic system which fails to 删除换行 join the regular lymphatic system accounts for the appearance  删除换行 of cystic hygroma.\n\n【33】Pathology.—\n\n【34】The swelling consists of aggregation of cysts which  删除换行 contain clear lymph. It can be considered as a multilocular  删除换行 swelling containing clear lymph. Each locule is lined by a  删除换行 single layer of endothelium. That is why this swelling is a  删除换行 brilliantly translucent swelling. Many locules or cysts may  删除换行 intercommunicate with one another. Cystic hygroma may  删除换行 infiltrate into the muscle planes and these extensions may  删除换行 grow deep.\n\n【35】Sites of cystic hygroma.—\n\n【36】(i) Posterior triangle of the neck is the commonest site. \n\n【37】The swelling gradually extends upwards towards the ear or  删除换行 downwards towards the axilla. The swelling may attain such  删除换行 a huge size that it becomes difficult to know which, is the  删除换行 actual site of origin. In a few textbooks it is described as an  删除换行 anterior triangle swelling.\n\n【38】(ii) In the cheek.\n\n【39】(iii) In axilla.删除5：<u> 1</u>\n(iv) In the groin. J Very rare.\n\n【40】(v) In the mediastinum.\n\n【41】These sites should be carefully looked for such swelling.\n删除3：<u>Fig. 8.6.— Cystic hygroma on the right side of the neck of a baby.</u>\n\n【42】Diagnosis.— .\n\n【43】Age.— It is the earliest swelling one can see in the neck. \n\n【44】It manifests in early infancy. Occasionally it is present at  删除换行 birth. Rarely it may be present before birth and if attains a  删除换行 large size may obstruct labour.\n\n【45】FISTULOUS\n\n【46】TRACK\n\n【47】The only complaint is the lump or swelling. The parents  删除换行 bring the children for disfigurement.\n\n【48】BRANCHIOGENIC CARCINOMA\n\n【49】(i) Site.— Its usual position is at the lower third of the  删除换行 neck in the posterior triangle.删除27：<u>SWELLINGS IN THE NECK 105</u>\n\n【50】(ii) Size and shape.— The size varies extremely. It is  删除换行 usually round in shape with smooth indistinct margin which  删除换行 yields to the palpating finger.\n\n【51】(iii) Surface.— Surface is smooth or lobulated. When  删除换行 multiple cysts or locula remain very near the surface, it may  删除换行 be lobulated. Usually large cyst remains towards the surface  删除换行 and gives a smooth surface.\n\n【52】(iv) Consistency.— It is extremely soft and cystic and  删除换行 fluctuation test is positive.\n\n【53】(v) Impulse on coughing.— This swelling gives an  删除换行 impulse on coughing. When the child coughs or cries the  删除换行 swelling visibly increases in size.\n删除3：<u>Fig. 8.7.— Cystic hygroma of a baby shown from behind.</u>\n\n【54】(vi) Compressibility.— The swelling is partially  删除换行 compressible, as the fluid in one loculus passes into the others. \n\n【55】But this cannot be reduced.\n\n【56】(vii) Translucency test.— It is a brilliantly translucent  删除换行 swelling and this is important for differential diagnosis. \n\n【57】During this test multiple septi may be noticed.\n\n【58】(viii) Regional lymph nodes are not enlarged.\n\n【59】Complications.—\n\n【60】(i) Sometimes the growth is extremely rapid and may  删除换行 cause respiratory difficulty. In this case immediate aspiration  删除换行 of as much content as possible is necessary. Tracheostomy  删除换行 may be required if this does not relieve respiratory difficulty.\n\n【61】(ii) Swelling may become infected as a result of  删除换行 nasopharyngeal infection.\n\n【62】(iii) Spontaneous recovery may take place particularly  删除换行 when the swelling becomes inflamed. Subsequent fibrosis  删除换行 will help spontaneous regression.\n\n【63】Treatment.—\n\n【64】Excision is the treatment of choice. Such excision may be  删除换行 delayed under strict follow-up till the child attains a  删除换行 reasonable age for excision.\n\n【65】Preliminary injection of boiling water into the cyst at  删除换行 weekly interval will cause regression of the swelling to a certain  删除换行 extent. The cyst wall becomes more fibrous. This should be  删除换行 followed by excision of the cyst. Preliminary injection will  删除换行 facilitate dissection. One must be careful to excise all the  删除换行 extensions through the muscle planes.\n\n【66】Dangers of incomplete removal.— (i) It may cause  删除换行 recurrence.\n\n【67】(ii) Continuous fluid and electrolyte loss through the  删除换行 open cysts will cause dehydration of the child.\n\n【68】(iii) It may lead to wound infection.\n\n【69】Radiotherapy may be tried in case of recurrence and when  删除换行 surgery is not possible. This swelling is redioresistant and  删除换行 hardly acts to radiotherapy.\n\n【70】CYSTIC HYGROMA\n\n【71】It is a cystic swelling developed in the remnant of the  删除换行 thyroglossal tract.\n\n【72】Development.—\n\n【73】From the ventral portion of the entoderm between the  删除换行 first and second branchial arch, a diverticulum extends  删除换行 downwards and forms the median thyroid diverticulum. This  删除换行 diverticulum moves downwards and comes in front of the  删除换行 thyroid cartilage to form the isthmus and pyramidal lobe of  删除换行 the thyroid gland. This tract is known as thyroglossal tract. \n\n【74】The hyoid bone which is developed from the second and  删除换行 third branchial arches come in very close relation with this  删除换行 tract. The entoderm from where the tract or the thyroglossal  删除换行 duct started ultimately forms the foramen caecum of the  删除换行 tongue.\n\n【75】The course of the thyroglossal tract or duct.— The thyroglossal  删除换行 duct passes down from the foramen caecum of the tongue  删除换行 between the genioglossi muscles. Then it passes along the  删除换行 midline downwards. It descends either in front of the hyoid  删除换行 bone or through the hyoid bone or it hooks below and behind  删除换行 the hyoid bone and then descends downwards along the  删除换行 midline to the upper border of the thyroid cartilage. It then  删除换行 moves slightly to the left and ultimately ends- in the  删除换行 pyramidal lobe of the thyroid gland.\n\n【76】Ultimate fate of the thyroglossal duct.—\n\n【77】(i) From the origin of the duct in the foramen caecum  删除换行 ectopic thyroid tissue may develop and form lingual thyroid.\n\n【78】This lingual thyroid is a red rounded swelling at the back of  删除换行 the tongue at the foramen caecum. It may represent the  删除换行 only thyroid tissue present.\n\n【79】(ii) The entire duct usually disappears except the lower  删除换行 portion which forms the isthmus of the thyroid gland and  删除换行 the pyramidal lobe.\n\n【80】(iii) The upper portion of the duct from the foramen  删除换行 caecum to the hyoid bone may disappear but the rest of the  删除换行 duct or tract persists as the levator glandulae thyroidae.删除27：<u>106 A TEXTBOOK ON SURGICAL SHORT CASES</u>\n\n【81】(iv) While the tract disappears, a portion of the duct  删除换行 may remain patent which gives rise to a cystic swelling due  删除换行 to accumulation of secretion and this is known as thyroglossal 删除换行 cyst. This is an example of tubulodermoid.\n\n【82】(v) An ectopic thyroid may occupy subhyoid position in  删除换行 the midline and simulate a thyroglossal cyst. It may be the  删除换行 only thyroid tissue present in the body.\n\n【83】Anterior\n\n【84】Hyoid bone\n\n【85】Thyroglossal duct\n\n【86】Figs.8.8. & 8.9.— Demonstrate the course of the thyroglossal  删除换行 duct.

In Fig. \n\n【87】8.9 the lateral view of the duct shows how it curves posterior to the  删除换行 hyoid bone.\n\n【88】Pathology-—\n\n【89】The thyroglossal cyst is lined by pseudostratified ciliated  删除换行 columnar epithelium. There may be squamous lining and  删除换行 mucous glands. There may be some lymphoid tissue outside  删除换行 the epithelial lining, for which this cyst is prone to become  删除换行 infected. It may contain thyroid tissue. The contents are  删除换行 usually mucoid and become thickened by desquamated  删除换行 epithelial cells or debris. Cholesterol crystals may be present. \n\n【90】Carcinomatous changes may occur in a thyroglossal cyst.\n\n【91】The followings are the cysts which contain cholesterol 删除换行 crystals —\n\n【92】• Thyroglossal cyst (may not be always).\n\n【93】• Branchial cyst.\n\n【94】• Hydrocele fluid.\n\n【95】• Dental cyst.\n\n【96】• Dentigerous cyst.\n\n【97】• Cystic hygroma (not always).\n\n【98】Clinical features.—\n\n【99】DEVELOPMENT.—\n\n【100】1.

It is usually a midline swelling except when it is below  删除换行 the thyroid cartilage where it may shift to one side, more  删除换行 commonly to the left.\n\n【104】2. Duration of symptoms.— The lump may be present for  删除换行 many years before the patient comes to the doctor. It is usually  删除换行 an increase in size which brings the patient to a clinician.\n\n【105】3.

Internal carotid artery is derived from the third arch  删除换行 while the external carotid artery sprouts out of the third  删除换行 arch and immediately becomes superficial, so the fistula  删除换行 traverses between these two arteries. The fistula passes deep  删除换行 to the posterior belly of the digastric and the stylohyoid  删除换行 muscle. It crosses superficial to the internal jugular vein and  删除换行 the hypoglossal nerve, the glossopharyngeal nerve and the  删除换行 stylopharyngeus muscle (derivatives of 3rd arch).

As the condition is not much  删除换行 troublesome patients often come to the clinician late.\n\n【13】(iii) The position of the external opening of the fistula is  删除换行 quite characteristic. It is nearly always situated in the lower  删除换行 third of the neck near the anterior border of the  删除换行 sternomastoid muscle (cf. branchial cyst which is situated  删除换行 in the upper part of the neck, so the acquired branchial fistula 删除换行 is seen at this region).\n\n【14】(iv) The surrounding skin may be excoriated due to  删除换行 discharge.\n\n【15】(v) Swallowing will cause the external fistula to be  删除换行 tucked in causing the dimple prominent.\n\n【16】Treatment.—\n\n【17】If the fistula becomes troublesome with discharge of  删除换行 mucus and repeated inflammation, the treatment is excision  删除换行 of the fistula track.\n\n【18】A sinogram may be made by injecting radio-opaque dye  删除换行 into the fistulous track to know the upper limit of the fistula.\n\n【19】First Method.—\n\n【20】A ureteric catheter may be passed up the track. An incision  删除换行 is made high up in the neck along the skin crease (Langer's  删除换行 line) and the dissection is continued to get the upper limit  删除换行 of the track to the fork of the common carotid artery towards  删除换行 the pharyngeal wall. When the upper dissection is completed,  删除换行 the external orifice is freed by a small elliptical incision on  删除换行 the skin and whole of the lower part of the track is dissected  删除换行 out through the upper incision. Both the incisions are closed.删除27：<u>104 A TEXTBOOK ON SURGICAL SHORT CASES</u>\n\n【21】Second Method.—\n\n【22】In the beginning an elliptical incision is made around  删除换行 the external opening and the dissection is continued upward  删除换行 through the superficial fascia and platysma upto the upper  删除换行 border of the thyroid cartilage where it penetrates through  删除换行 the deep fascia. Gentle traction to the fistula track will  删除换行 facilitate identification of the fistula and its dissection  删除换行 upwards. A second incision may be required above the upper  删除换行 border of the thyroid cartilage transversally placed along the \n\n【23】Langer's line.

An incision  删除换行 is made high up in the neck along the skin crease (Langer's  删除换行 line) and the dissection is continued to get the upper limit  删除换行 of the track to the fork of the common carotid artery towards  删除换行 the pharyngeal wall.

Both the incisions  删除换行 are closed with or without drainage. During dissection one  删除换行 must be careful, as many important nerves and blood vessels,  删除换行 which have been discussed earlier, are around.\n\n【24】Complete removal is necessary to avoid recurrence.\n\n【25】BRANCHIAL FISTULA\n\n【26】This is a rare tumour which arises from the remnant of  删除换行 the branchial cleft. This is a deep-seated carcinoma with no  删除换行 other primary tumour ever discovered. As a matter of fact a  删除换行 clinical diagnosis of branchiogenic carcinoma is rarely justified  删除换行 until and unless one very clearly excludes primary growth in  删除换行 the mouth, tongue, pharynx, larynx and external auditory  删除换行 meatus. Again at times a primary carcinoma of the mouth  删除换行 or pharynx may remain silent for months, the only evidence  删除换行 of its presence being a deep-seated cervical lymph node.\n\n【27】This carcinoma is commoner in males and is situated  删除换行 deep in the neck near the bifurcation of the common carotid  删除换行 artery. It infiltrates the surrounding structures and  删除换行 metastasises to the regional lymph nodes. Microscopically, 删除换行 the tumour consists of squamous or transitional cells arranged  删除换行 in masses, in the centre of which cavities may appear due to  删除换行 necrosis. Lymphoid tissue may be seen here and there, as is  删除换行 seen in a branchial cyst.\n\n【28】PHARYNX\n\n【29】It is a cystic swelling which contains multiple locules of  删除换行 clear lymph.\n\n【30】SKIN\n\n【31】In human embryo at about the 6th week the lymph sacs  删除换行 develop six in number from which the lymph vessels are  删除换行 derived. One pair in the neck called jugular lymph sacs  删除换行 develop near the origin of the internal jugular vein. One at  删除换行 the retroperitoneal tissue and another lymph sac is called  删除换行 cysterna chyli. Another pair develops near the inguinal region  删除换行 below the bifurcation of the common iliac vein. This pair is  删除换行 called posterior lymph sac.\n\n【32】The jugular lymph sac is first to appear at the junction  删除换行 of the subclavian vein with the anterior cardinal vein which  删除换行 ultimately forms the jugular vein. Sequestration of a portion  删除换行 of the jugular sac from the lymphatic system which fails to 删除换行 join the regular lymphatic system accounts for the appearance  删除换行 of cystic hygroma.\n\n【33】Pathology.—\n\n【34】The swelling consists of aggregation of cysts which  删除换行 contain clear lymph. It can be considered as a multilocular  删除换行 swelling containing clear lymph. Each locule is lined by a  删除换行 single layer of endothelium. That is why this swelling is a  删除换行 brilliantly translucent swelling. Many locules or cysts may  删除换行 intercommunicate with one another. Cystic hygroma may  删除换行 infiltrate into the muscle planes and these extensions may  删除换行 grow deep.\n\n【35】Sites of cystic hygroma.—\n\n【36】(i) Posterior triangle of the neck is the commonest site. \n\n【37】The swelling gradually extends upwards towards the ear or  删除换行 downwards towards the axilla. The swelling may attain such  删除换行 a huge size that it becomes difficult to know which, is the  删除换行 actual site of origin. In a few textbooks it is described as an  删除换行 anterior triangle swelling.\n\n【38】(ii) In the cheek.\n\n【39】(iii) In axilla.删除5：<u> 1</u>\n(iv) In the groin. J Very rare.\n\n【40】(v) In the mediastinum.\n\n【41】These sites should be carefully looked for such swelling.\n删除3：<u>Fig. 8.6.— Cystic hygroma on the right side of the neck of a baby.</u>\n\n【42】Diagnosis.— .\n\n【43】Age.— It is the earliest swelling one can see in the neck. \n\n【44】It manifests in early infancy. Occasionally it is present at  删除换行 birth. Rarely it may be present before birth and if attains a  删除换行 large size may obstruct labour.\n\n【45】FISTULOUS\n\n【46】TRACK\n\n【47】The only complaint is the lump or swelling. The parents  删除换行 bring the children for disfigurement.\n\n【48】BRANCHIOGENIC CARCINOMA\n\n【49】(i) Site.— Its usual position is at the lower third of the  删除换行 neck in the posterior triangle.删除27：<u>SWELLINGS IN THE NECK 105</u>\n\n【50】(ii) Size and shape.— The size varies extremely. It is  删除换行 usually round in shape with smooth indistinct margin which  删除换行 yields to the palpating finger.\n\n【51】(iii) Surface.— Surface is smooth or lobulated. When  删除换行 multiple cysts or locula remain very near the surface, it may  删除换行 be lobulated. Usually large cyst remains towards the surface  删除换行 and gives a smooth surface.\n\n【52】(iv) Consistency.— It is extremely soft and cystic and  删除换行 fluctuation test is positive.\n\n【53】(v) Impulse on coughing.— This swelling gives an  删除换行 impulse on coughing. When the child coughs or cries the  删除换行 swelling visibly increases in size.\n删除3：<u>Fig. 8.7.— Cystic hygroma of a baby shown from behind.</u>\n\n【54】(vi) Compressibility.— The swelling is partially  删除换行 compressible, as the fluid in one loculus passes into the others. \n\n【55】But this cannot be reduced.\n\n【56】(vii) Translucency test.— It is a brilliantly translucent  删除换行 swelling and this is important for differential diagnosis. \n\n【57】During this test multiple septi may be noticed.\n\n【58】(viii) Regional lymph nodes are not enlarged.\n\n【59】Complications.—\n\n【60】(i) Sometimes the growth is extremely rapid and may  删除换行 cause respiratory difficulty. In this case immediate aspiration  删除换行 of as much content as possible is necessary. Tracheostomy  删除换行 may be required if this does not relieve respiratory difficulty.\n\n【61】(ii) Swelling may become infected as a result of  删除换行 nasopharyngeal infection.\n\n【62】(iii) Spontaneous recovery may take place particularly  删除换行 when the swelling becomes inflamed. Subsequent fibrosis  删除换行 will help spontaneous regression.\n\n【63】Treatment.—\n\n【64】Excision is the treatment of choice. Such excision may be  删除换行 delayed under strict follow-up till the child attains a  删除换行 reasonable age for excision.\n\n【65】Preliminary injection of boiling water into the cyst at  删除换行 weekly interval will cause regression of the swelling to a certain  删除换行 extent. The cyst wall becomes more fibrous. This should be  删除换行 followed by excision of the cyst. Preliminary injection will  删除换行 facilitate dissection. One must be careful to excise all the  删除换行 extensions through the muscle planes.\n\n【66】Dangers of incomplete removal.— (i) It may cause  删除换行 recurrence.\n\n【67】(ii) Continuous fluid and electrolyte loss through the  删除换行 open cysts will cause dehydration of the child.\n\n【68】(iii) It may lead to wound infection.\n\n【69】Radiotherapy may be tried in case of recurrence and when  删除换行 surgery is not possible. This swelling is redioresistant and  删除换行 hardly acts to radiotherapy.\n\n【70】CYSTIC HYGROMA\n\n【71】It is a cystic swelling developed in the remnant of the  删除换行 thyroglossal tract.\n\n【72】Development.—\n\n【73】From the ventral portion of the entoderm between the  删除换行 first and second branchial arch, a diverticulum extends  删除换行 downwards and forms the median thyroid diverticulum. This  删除换行 diverticulum moves downwards and comes in front of the  删除换行 thyroid cartilage to form the isthmus and pyramidal lobe of  删除换行 the thyroid gland. This tract is known as thyroglossal tract. \n\n【74】The hyoid bone which is developed from the second and  删除换行 third branchial arches come in very close relation with this  删除换行 tract. The entoderm from where the tract or the thyroglossal  删除换行 duct started ultimately forms the foramen caecum of the  删除换行 tongue.\n\n【75】The course of the thyroglossal tract or duct.— The thyroglossal  删除换行 duct passes down from the foramen caecum of the tongue  删除换行 between the genioglossi muscles. Then it passes along the  删除换行 midline downwards. It descends either in front of the hyoid  删除换行 bone or through the hyoid bone or it hooks below and behind  删除换行 the hyoid bone and then descends downwards along the  删除换行 midline to the upper border of the thyroid cartilage. It then  删除换行 moves slightly to the left and ultimately ends- in the  删除换行 pyramidal lobe of the thyroid gland.\n\n【76】Ultimate fate of the thyroglossal duct.—\n\n【77】(i) From the origin of the duct in the foramen caecum  删除换行 ectopic thyroid tissue may develop and form lingual thyroid.\n\n【78】This lingual thyroid is a red rounded swelling at the back of  删除换行 the tongue at the foramen caecum. It may represent the  删除换行 only thyroid tissue present.\n\n【79】(ii) The entire duct usually disappears except the lower  删除换行 portion which forms the isthmus of the thyroid gland and  删除换行 the pyramidal lobe.\n\n【80】(iii) The upper portion of the duct from the foramen  删除换行 caecum to the hyoid bone may disappear but the rest of the  删除换行 duct or tract persists as the levator glandulae thyroidae.删除27：<u>106 A TEXTBOOK ON SURGICAL SHORT CASES</u>\n\n【81】(iv) While the tract disappears, a portion of the duct  删除换行 may remain patent which gives rise to a cystic swelling due  删除换行 to accumulation of secretion and this is known as thyroglossal 删除换行 cyst. This is an example of tubulodermoid.\n\n【82】(v) An ectopic thyroid may occupy subhyoid position in  删除换行 the midline and simulate a thyroglossal cyst. It may be the  删除换行 only thyroid tissue present in the body.\n\n【83】Anterior\n\n【84】Hyoid bone\n\n【85】Thyroglossal duct\n\n【86】Figs.8.8. & 8.9.— Demonstrate the course of the thyroglossal  删除换行 duct.

The swelling may attain such  删除换行 a huge size that it becomes difficult to know which, is the  删除换行 actual site of origin. In a few textbooks it is described as an  删除换行 anterior triangle swelling.\n\n【38】(ii) In the cheek.\n\n【39】(iii) In axilla.删除5：<u> 1</u>\n(iv) In the groin. J Very rare.\n\n【40】(v) In the mediastinum.\n\n【41】These sites should be carefully looked for such swelling.\n删除3：<u>Fig. 8.6.— Cystic hygroma on the right side of the neck of a baby.</u>\n\n【42】Diagnosis.— .\n\n【43】Age.— It is the earliest swelling one can see in the neck. \n\n【44】It manifests in early infancy. Occasionally it is present at  删除换行 birth. Rarely it may be present before birth and if attains a  删除换行 large size may obstruct labour.\n\n【45】FISTULOUS\n\n【46】TRACK\n\n【47】The only complaint is the lump or swelling. The parents  删除换行 bring the children for disfigurement.\n\n【48】BRANCHIOGENIC CARCINOMA\n\n【49】(i) Site.— Its usual position is at the lower third of the  删除换行 neck in the posterior triangle.删除27：<u>SWELLINGS IN THE NECK 105</u>\n\n【50】(ii) Size and shape.— The size varies extremely. It is  删除换行 usually round in shape with smooth indistinct margin which  删除换行 yields to the palpating finger.\n\n【51】(iii) Surface.— Surface is smooth or lobulated. When  删除换行 multiple cysts or locula remain very near the surface, it may  删除换行 be lobulated. Usually large cyst remains towards the surface  删除换行 and gives a smooth surface.\n\n【52】(iv) Consistency.— It is extremely soft and cystic and  删除换行 fluctuation test is positive.\n\n【53】(v) Impulse on coughing.— This swelling gives an  删除换行 impulse on coughing. When the child coughs or cries the  删除换行 swelling visibly increases in size.\n删除3：<u>Fig. 8.7.— Cystic hygroma of a baby shown from behind.</u>\n\n【54】(vi) Compressibility.— The swelling is partially  删除换行 compressible, as the fluid in one loculus passes into the others. \n\n【55】But this cannot be reduced.\n\n【56】(vii) Translucency test.— It is a brilliantly translucent  删除换行 swelling and this is important for differential diagnosis. \n\n【57】During this test multiple septi may be noticed.\n\n【58】(viii) Regional lymph nodes are not enlarged.\n\n【59】Complications.—\n\n【60】(i) Sometimes the growth is extremely rapid and may  删除换行 cause respiratory difficulty. In this case immediate aspiration  删除换行 of as much content as possible is necessary. Tracheostomy  删除换行 may be required if this does not relieve respiratory difficulty.\n\n【61】(ii) Swelling may become infected as a result of  删除换行 nasopharyngeal infection.\n\n【62】(iii) Spontaneous recovery may take place particularly  删除换行 when the swelling becomes inflamed. Subsequent fibrosis  删除换行 will help spontaneous regression.\n\n【63】Treatment.—\n\n【64】Excision is the treatment of choice. Such excision may be  删除换行 delayed under strict follow-up till the child attains a  删除换行 reasonable age for excision.\n\n【65】Preliminary injection of boiling water into the cyst at  删除换行 weekly interval will cause regression of the swelling to a certain  删除换行 extent. The cyst wall becomes more fibrous. This should be  删除换行 followed by excision of the cyst. Preliminary injection will  删除换行 facilitate dissection. One must be careful to excise all the  删除换行 extensions through the muscle planes.\n\n【66】Dangers of incomplete removal.— (i) It may cause  删除换行 recurrence.\n\n【67】(ii) Continuous fluid and electrolyte loss through the  删除换行 open cysts will cause dehydration of the child.\n\n【68】(iii) It may lead to wound infection.\n\n【69】Radiotherapy may be tried in case of recurrence and when  删除换行 surgery is not possible. This swelling is redioresistant and  删除换行 hardly acts to radiotherapy.\n\n【70】CYSTIC HYGROMA\n\n【71】It is a cystic swelling developed in the remnant of the  删除换行 thyroglossal tract.\n\n【72】Development.—\n\n【73】From the ventral portion of the entoderm between the  删除换行 first and second branchial arch, a diverticulum extends  删除换行 downwards and forms the median thyroid diverticulum. This  删除换行 diverticulum moves downwards and comes in front of the  删除换行 thyroid cartilage to form the isthmus and pyramidal lobe of  删除换行 the thyroid gland. This tract is known as thyroglossal tract. \n\n【74】The hyoid bone which is developed from the second and  删除换行 third branchial arches come in very close relation with this  删除换行 tract. The entoderm from where the tract or the thyroglossal  删除换行 duct started ultimately forms the foramen caecum of the  删除换行 tongue.\n\n【75】The course of the thyroglossal tract or duct.— The thyroglossal  删除换行 duct passes down from the foramen caecum of the tongue  删除换行 between the genioglossi muscles. Then it passes along the  删除换行 midline downwards. It descends either in front of the hyoid  删除换行 bone or through the hyoid bone or it hooks below and behind  删除换行 the hyoid bone and then descends downwards along the  删除换行 midline to the upper border of the thyroid cartilage. It then  删除换行 moves slightly to the left and ultimately ends- in the  删除换行 pyramidal lobe of the thyroid gland.\n\n【76】Ultimate fate of the thyroglossal duct.—\n\n【77】(i) From the origin of the duct in the foramen caecum  删除换行 ectopic thyroid tissue may develop and form lingual thyroid.\n\n【78】This lingual thyroid is a red rounded swelling at the back of  删除换行 the tongue at the foramen caecum. It may represent the  删除换行 only thyroid tissue present.\n\n【79】(ii) The entire duct usually disappears except the lower  删除换行 portion which forms the isthmus of the thyroid gland and  删除换行 the pyramidal lobe.\n\n【80】(iii) The upper portion of the duct from the foramen  删除换行 caecum to the hyoid bone may disappear but the rest of the  删除换行 duct or tract persists as the levator glandulae thyroidae.删除27：<u>106 A TEXTBOOK ON SURGICAL SHORT CASES</u>\n\n【81】(iv) While the tract disappears, a portion of the duct  删除换行 may remain patent which gives rise to a cystic swelling due  删除换行 to accumulation of secretion and this is known as thyroglossal 删除换行 cyst. This is an example of tubulodermoid.\n\n【82】(v) An ectopic thyroid may occupy subhyoid position in  删除换行 the midline and simulate a thyroglossal cyst. It may be the  删除换行 only thyroid tissue present in the body.\n\n【83】Anterior\n\n【84】Hyoid bone\n\n【85】Thyroglossal duct\n\n【86】Figs.8.8. & 8.9.— Demonstrate the course of the thyroglossal  删除换行 duct. In the anterior view note that it is a midline structure except in  删除换行 front of the thyroid cartilage where it shifts slightly to the left. In Fig. \n\n【87】8.9 the lateral view of the duct shows how it curves posterior to the  删除换行 hyoid bone.\n\n【88】Pathology-—\n\n【89】The thyroglossal cyst is lined by pseudostratified ciliated  删除换行 columnar epithelium. There may be squamous lining and  删除换行 mucous glands. There may be some lymphoid tissue outside  删除换行 the epithelial lining, for which this cyst is prone to become  删除换行 infected. It may contain thyroid tissue. The contents are  删除换行 usually mucoid and become thickened by desquamated  删除换行 epithelial cells or debris. Cholesterol crystals may be present. \n\n【90】Carcinomatous changes may occur in a thyroglossal cyst.\n\n【91】The followings are the cysts which contain cholesterol 删除换行 crystals —\n\n【92】• Thyroglossal cyst (may not be always).\n\n【93】• Branchial cyst.\n\n【94】• Hydrocele fluid.\n\n【95】• Dental cyst.\n\n【96】• Dentigerous cyst.\n\n【97】• Cystic hygroma (not always).\n\n【98】Clinical features.—\n\n【99】DEVELOPMENT.—\n\n【100】1. Age.— Thyroglossal cyst may appear at any age, but  删除换行 majority of the patients are between 15 and 30 years of age.\n\n【101】2. Sex.— This cyst is more commonly seen in women. \n\n【102】SYMPTOMS.—\n\n【103】1. The commonest symptom is a painless swelling in the  删除换行 neck. It is usually a midline swelling except when it is below  删除换行 the thyroid cartilage where it may shift to one side, more  删除换行 commonly to the left.\n\n【104】2. Duration of symptoms.— The lump may be present for  删除换行 many years before the patient comes to the doctor. It is usually  删除换行 an increase in size which brings the patient to a clinician.\n\n【105】3. Pain in the cyst is almost always associated with  删除换行 infection of the cyst.\n\n【106】Suprahyoid\n\n【107】Subhyoid (Commonest)\n\n【108】In front of the thyroid Cartilage\n\n【109】(2nd common)\n\n【110】Isthmus of thyroid\n\n【111】Beneath the foram«n caecum\n删除3：<u>Fig.8.10.— Various positions of the thyroglossal cyst which may develop anywhere along the course of the thyroglossal duct are 删除换行 demonstrated.

A solid nodule with ill-defined borders on imaging  删除换行 is likely to be a malignant tumour, while that with a sharp circumscription is more likely to  删除换行 be benign; however, there are many exceptions to this rule. Cysts may also arise in the testis  删除换行 but more commonly in its vestigial remnants (appendix of testis and appendix of epididymis)  删除换行 and are benign, although they may enlarge and undergo torsion. Loculated hydrocele may  删除换行 develop secondary to trauma or inflammatory conditions. Fluid collections around the tes删除8：<u>￾</u>tis may be fluctuant and transilluminant on physical examination, and an ultrasound will  删除换行 confirm the fluid contents. Inflammatory conditions such as epididymo-orchitis (mumps,  删除换行 tuberculosis) are accompanied by systemic symptoms such as fever and a painful testicular  删除换行 mass. Syphilitic gumma may be painless, representing burnt-out disease (tertiary syphilis). \n\n【13】Serum tumour markers play an important role in the diagnosis, staging, risk stratification,  删除换行 and post-treatment monitoring of testicular cancer. On the other hand, serum markers are  删除换行 normal in testicular cysts and benign tumours such as Leydig cell adenoma. \n\n【14】Serum LDH is elevated in seminoma, but it is a relatively non-specific marker, as LDH is  删除换行 secreted by a number of other organs such as the liver. Serum AFP is elevated in yolk sac  删除换行 tumours, while hCG is produced in large quantities in a choriocarcinoma. Monitoring serum  删除换行 tumour marker levels after removal of the tumour is useful, as this would be accompanied  删除换行 by a steep decline in its serum levels, which may progressively rise again if there is tumour  删除换行 recurrence. Testicular tumours frequently occur in mixed forms so that one or more of these  删除换行 serum markers may be elevated. \n\n【15】Pathological examination of the testis following orchidectomy plays a key role in predicting  删除换行 clinical outcome. Malignant tumours (95%) are much more common than benign tumours. \n\n【16】Broadly speaking, these are germ cell tumours and are subdivided into seminoma and non删除8：<u>￾</u>seminomatous histological types. Seminoma is the most common subtype (80%), while  删除换行 embryonal carcinoma, yolk sac tumour, and choriocarcinoma are collectively referred to as  删除换行 non-seminomatous germ cell tumours (NSGCTs). Teratomas are another interesting subtype  删除换行 of testicular cancer characterised by the presence of somatic (epithelial and connective tissue)  删除换行 elements. NSGCTs may transform into the less aggressive teratoma following good response  删除换行 to chemotherapy. \n\n【17】Other adverse pathological features that influence clinical outcome include lymphovascular  删除换行 invasion, invasion of the rete testis, spermatic cord, peritoneal covering (tunica vaginalis),  删除换行 and scrotal skin. Ultrasound and CT scan are important in identifying metastases to lymph  删除换行 nodes and other organs such as lungs, liver, and bones. \n\n【18】Treatment of seminoma in the absence of these adverse features is orchidectomy and is cura删除8：<u>￾</u>tive in 80–85% cases. Adjuvant chemotherapy is required if adverse features are present or  删除换行 for NSGCT with markedly elevated serum tumour markers. \n\n【19】It is also important to remember that germ cell tumours may arise in an extratesticular loca删除8：<u>￾</u>tion anywhere along the midline from the base of the skull to the sacrococcygeal tip.

A solid nodule with ill-defined borders on imaging  删除换行 is likely to be a malignant tumour, while that with a sharp circumscription is more likely to  删除换行 be benign; however, there are many exceptions to this rule. Cysts may also arise in the testis  删除换行 but more commonly in its vestigial remnants (appendix of testis and appendix of epididymis)  删除换行 and are benign, although they may enlarge and undergo torsion. Loculated hydrocele may  删除换行 develop secondary to trauma or inflammatory conditions. Fluid collections around the tes删除8：<u>￾</u>tis may be fluctuant and transilluminant on physical examination, and an ultrasound will  删除换行 confirm the fluid contents. Inflammatory conditions such as epididymo-orchitis (mumps,  删除换行 tuberculosis) are accompanied by systemic symptoms such as fever and a painful testicular  删除换行 mass. Syphilitic gumma may be painless, representing burnt-out disease (tertiary syphilis). \n\n【13】Serum tumour markers play an important role in the diagnosis, staging, risk stratification,  删除换行 and post-treatment monitoring of testicular cancer. On the other hand, serum markers are  删除换行 normal in testicular cysts and benign tumours such as Leydig cell adenoma. \n\n【14】Serum LDH is elevated in seminoma, but it is a relatively non-specific marker, as LDH is  删除换行 secreted by a number of other organs such as the liver. Serum AFP is elevated in yolk sac  删除换行 tumours, while hCG is produced in large quantities in a choriocarcinoma. Monitoring serum  删除换行 tumour marker levels after removal of the tumour is useful, as this would be accompanied  删除换行 by a steep decline in its serum levels, which may progressively rise again if there is tumour  删除换行 recurrence. Testicular tumours frequently occur in mixed forms so that one or more of these  删除换行 serum markers may be elevated. \n\n【15】Pathological examination of the testis following orchidectomy plays a key role in predicting  删除换行 clinical outcome. Malignant tumours (95%) are much more common than benign tumours. \n\n【16】Broadly speaking, these are germ cell tumours and are subdivided into seminoma and non删除8：<u>￾</u>seminomatous histological types. Seminoma is the most common subtype (80%), while  删除换行 embryonal carcinoma, yolk sac tumour, and choriocarcinoma are collectively referred to as  删除换行 non-seminomatous germ cell tumours (NSGCTs). Teratomas are another interesting subtype  删除换行 of testicular cancer characterised by the presence of somatic (epithelial and connective tissue)  删除换行 elements. NSGCTs may transform into the less aggressive teratoma following good response  删除换行 to chemotherapy. \n\n【17】Other adverse pathological features that influence clinical outcome include lymphovascular  删除换行 invasion, invasion of the rete testis, spermatic cord, peritoneal covering (tunica vaginalis),  删除换行 and scrotal skin. Ultrasound and CT scan are important in identifying metastases to lymph  删除换行 nodes and other organs such as lungs, liver, and bones. \n\n【18】Treatment of seminoma in the absence of these adverse features is orchidectomy and is cura删除8：<u>￾</u>tive in 80–85% cases. Adjuvant chemotherapy is required if adverse features are present or  删除换行 for NSGCT with markedly elevated serum tumour markers. \n\n【19】It is also important to remember that germ cell tumours may arise in an extratesticular loca删除8：<u>￾</u>tion anywhere along the midline from the base of the skull to the sacrococcygeal tip.

He has not had any blood in his stool. He denies contact with anyone with similar symptoms recently. He has not eaten any raw or unprocessed foods recently. The only food that he did not prepare himself in the past week was a breakfast of eggs “sunny-side up” and bacon that he had at a diner the day before his symptoms started. On examination, he is tired appearing; his temperature is 99.9 <sup>° </sup> F (37.7 <sup>° </sup> C); and his heart rate is 95 beats/minute while he is lying down, but it increases to 120 beats/minute when he sits up. His blood pressure is 145/85 mm Hg while lying down and 110/60 mm Hg when sitting. The physician interprets this as a positive “tilt test,” indicating significant volume depletion. His mucous membranes appear dry. Abdominal examination is notable for diffuse tenderness but there are no palpable masses, rebound, or guarding. Rectal examination reveals only heme-negative watery stool.\n\n【3】 What is the most likely etiologic agent of this infection?\n\n【4】 What are the most common sources of human infections with this organism?\n\n【5】### ANSWERS TO CASE 19:\n\n【6】#### Salmonella and Shigella\n\n【7】Summary: A 48-year-old man with acute gastroenteritis has fever, a positive tilt test, abdominal pain, and diarrhea after eating eggs a day before.\n\n【8】• Most likely etiology of infection: Salmonella .\n\n【9】• Most common sources of infection: Undercooked poultry, eggs, dairy products, or foods prepared on contaminated work surfaces.\n\n【10】### CLINICAL CORRELATION\n\n【11】This individual has the acute onset of diarrhea and vomiting. The first priorities as with any patient are the “ABCs”: airway, breathing, circulation. Circulatory status is assessed by monitoring the pulse rate and blood pressure, which may be normal at rest, but abnormal on changing of position. This patient had a rise in 10 beats/minute heart rate from the lying to the sitting position and a fall of 10 mm Hg of blood pressure. This constitutes a positive tilt test and may indicate a volume depletion of 10% to 25%, consistent with orthostatic hypotension. Thus, the first therapeutic goal would be volume repletion, such as with intravenous normal saline.\n\n【12】In humans, most cases of nontyphoidal Salmonella result from ingesting contaminated food products. Poultry, eggs, dairy products, or other foods prepared on contaminated work surfaces are the most common sources. Fecal–oral spread is common among children. Live animals, especially exotic pets such as reptiles, have also been identified as sources of infection. Host gastric acid is a primary defense against the organism, and conditions or medications that reduce gastric acidity may predispose to infection. The primary site of invasion of Salmonella is the M (microfold) cells in the Peyer patches of the distal ileum. M cells internalize and transfer foreign antigens from the intestinal lumen to macrophages and leukocyte. The infection can then spread to adjacent cells and lymphoid tissue. Host inflammatory responses usually limit the infection to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, but bacteremia can occur. Bacteremia is more common in children, elderly patients, or those with immune deficiencies, such as AIDS. Gastroenteritis is the most common clinical manifestation of Salmonella infection. Nausea, vomiting, nonbloody diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps starting 8 to 48 hours after ingestion of contaminated food are typical. The illness is generally self-limited and will last from 2 to 7 days.\n\n【13】Enteric fever, or typhoid fever, is a more severe form of gastroenteritis with systemic symptoms caused by either Salmonella typhi or Salmonella paratyphi . Symptoms include chills, headache, anorexia, weakness, and muscle aches; and, later, fever, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly; and in a third of patients, a maculopapular rash (rose spots). Symptoms persist for a longer period of time than nontyphoidal gastroenteritis, as does the carrier state in a small percentage of infected patients.\n\n【14】Gastroenteritis caused by Salmonella can mimic the signs and symptoms of other forms of infections such as Shigella . Infection with Shigella produces predominantly diarrhea, which is sometimes grossly bloody as a result of invasion of the mucosa. The infection is also usually self-limited; however, dehydration can occur if diarrhea is severe.\n\n【15】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【16】#### Suspected Salmonella and Shigella Infection\n\n【17】### OBJECTIVES\n\n【18】1\\. Know the structure, characteristics, and clinical diseases associated with Salmonella .\n\n【19】2\\. Know the virulence, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of Salmonella infections.\n\n【20】3\\. Know the structure, characteristics, and clinical diseases associated with Shigella .\n\n【21】4\\. Know the virulence, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of Shigella infections.\n\n【22】### DEFINITIONS\n\n【23】ROSE SPOTS: Papular rash usually on the lower trunk leaving a darkening of the skin, characteristic of typhoid fever\n\n【24】FECAL LEUKOCYTES: White blood cells found in the stool, nonspecific finding of an invasive process\n\n【25】HEPATOSPLENOMEGALY: Enlargement of both the liver and the spleen that can be a feature of many diseases, including typhoid fever\n\n【26】### DISCUSSION\n\n【27】Characteristics of Salmonella and Shigella\n\n【28】Salmonella species are motile, facultative anaerobic, non–spore-forming, gram-negative bacilli that are part of the family Enterobacteriaceae. The genus Salmonella consists of more than 2400 serotypes capable of infecting almost all animal species. However, S. typhi and S. paratyphi only colonize humans. Salmonella is protected from phagocytic destruction by two mechanisms: an acid tolerance response gene, which protects it both from gastric acid and from the acidic pH of the phagosome, and Salmonella –secreted invasion proteins (Sips or Ssps). These rearrange M-cell actin, resulting in membranes that surround and engulf the Salmonella and enable intracellular replication of the pathogen with subsequent host cell death.\n\n【29】Shigella is a nonmotile gram-negative bacilli that is also part of the family Enterobacteriaceae. There are 40 serotypes of Shigella that are divided into 4 groups or species, based on biochemical reactivity. S. dysenteriae is group A, S. flexneri is group B, S. boydii is group C, and S. sonnei is group D. Virulence mechanisms of Shigella include their ability to invade the intestinal mucosa and production of shiga toxin, which acts to destroy the intestinal mucosa once the organism has invaded the tissue. Some strains of Escherichia coli are closely related to Shigella species and are also capable of producing shiga toxin.\n\n【30】### DIAGNOSIS\n\n【31】The diagnosis of gastroenteritis is based on the patient’s age, risk factors, exposures, and symptoms. Collection of stool and blood cultures, if fever and other systemic symptoms are present, is necessary for the definitive diagnosis. A direct examination for fecal leukocytes and occult blood may initially help narrow down the differential diagnosis. For example, blood in the stools usually indicates invasive bacterial infection. In cases of bacterial gastroenteritis, final diagnosis is made by culture of the stool for enteric pathogens such as Campylobacter, Shigella , and Salmonella . Although culture of Campylobacter requires specialized media and incubation conditions, both Salmonella and Shigella grow rapidly on routine microbiologic media. Because stool contains many organisms that are normal flora, stools are also cultured onto selective media to aid in more rapid diagnosis.\n\n【32】Both Salmonella and Shigella are nonlactose fermenters that appear as clear colonies on MacConkey agar. The use of a medium that contains an indicator for production of H <sub>2 </sub> S helps differentiate the two genera. Shigella does not produce H <sub>2 </sub> S and appears as clear or green colonies on a media such as Hektoen enteric (HE) agar, whereas Salmonella appears black as a result of production of H <sub>2 </sub> S. This is only presumptive, and further biochemical testing needs to be performed because other organisms also produce black colonies on HE agar. The diagnosis of Shigella can also be made by testing for Shiga toxin directly in the stool. This cannot differentiate Shigella from the enterohemorrhagic E. coli that also produce shiga toxin and are associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome.\n\n【33】### TREATMENT AND PREVENTION\n\n【34】Nontyphoid Salmonella gastroenteritis is usually not treated because it is a self-limited disease, and antibiotics have not been shown to alter the course of the infection. Primary treatment should be supportive, including fluid replacement if necessary. Antibiotic treatment is recommended for treatment of bacteremia, long-term carriers, or typhoid fever. Amoxicillin, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, or, in areas where antibiotic resistant strains are prevalent (India, Asia and Africa), quinolones can be used. The specific choice of antimicrobial agent should be based on susceptibility testing of the patient’s isolate.\n\n【35】In the case of infection caused by Shigella , antibiotic therapy has been shown to be useful, especially in the prevention of person-to-person spread of the disease. Quinolones can also be used to treat, although Shigella therapy should be based on antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the isolate.\n\n【36】Prevention of disease caused by enteric pathogens is based on control of the contaminated source in the environment and good personal hygiene. The thorough cooking of poultry and cooking eggs until the yolk is hard can kill Salmonella and prevent infection. A vaccine does exist for prevention of typhoid fever, which is useful for travelers to endemic areas of the world. The efficacy of the vaccine is thought to be between 50% and 80%.\n\n【37】###", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 11:22:07", "endTime": "2024/09/12 11:26:36", "cost": 268.32}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:25", "update_time": "2024-09-11 19:26:36", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 19:22:07"}

Properly authorized surrogates can make any decision that the patient could have made if she were capable. This includes decisions to refuse or forego even life-sustaining therapies. It is uncontroversial that competent patients have the right to refuse any and all medical therapies. Patients who are incapable of communicating a choice cannot be considered decisionally capable.

Observing that the patient is capable of understanding her situation, the doctors honor her refusal of intubation.\n\n【8】B. Believing that she is incompetent because she has just attempted suicide, doctors spend 15 minutes attempting to reach the patient’s parents to ask whether it would be appropriate to intubate her.\n\n【9】C.

The physicians briefly attempt to persuade the patient to assent to intubation; however, when this fails, they override her refusal and intubate her despite her objections. They take care to avoid any additional harm while restraining her.\n\n【11】Answer: 14.2 D. An otherwise healthy patient who has just attempted suicide is considered incompetent by definition and cannot refuse life-sustaining therapies. In this case, a life-threatening emergency exists, and, in the absence of immediately available surrogates, the doctors can intubate this patient on the basis of the emergency (presumed) consent doctrine. Intubation should not be delayed while surrogates are sought. The strategy of waiting for the patient to lose consciousness has 2 major flaws: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> The delay risks unnecessary harm because the loss of consciousness implies some degree of hypoxia, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> it assumes that the patient’s initial refusal must be honored and then seeks a work-around to avoid the obligation to honor that refusal. If the refusal should have been honored in the first place, then it should be honored after she loses consciousness. It should be noted that if surrogates had refused intubation on this patient’s behalf (not one of the answers), then there would be a strong case for overriding their refusal as well.\n\n【12】Question: 14.3 Which of the following is not an element of informed consent?\n\n【13】A. Voluntariness: The medical decision is made free of coercive pressure from caregivers or others.\n\n【14】B.

Documentation: Informed consent must be documented in writing and the document must be signed by the patient or his or her surrogate.\n\n【16】D. Disclosure: Clinicians have shared information about the current situation and the risks and benefits of various treatment alternatives.\nAnswer: 14.3 C. Documentation is not a necessary part of informed consent, although in special situations (eg, surgery, human subjects research), policies may require an informed consent document as proof that some minimal standard has been met.

Laboratory tests show a serum bicarbonate level of 50.9 mmol/L, pH of 7.61, serum sodium of 125 mEq/L, potassium of 1.8 mEq/L, and chloride of 55 mEq/L. She is treated aggressively with fluid, electrolytes, and a diuretic. Which of the following is the most appropriate diuretic to treat this patient?\n\n【1】> (A) Acetazolamide\n\n【2】> (B) Ethacrynic acid\n\n【3】> (C) Furosemide\n\n【4】> (D) Hydrochlorothiazide\n\n【5】> (E) Mannitol\n\n【6】 Answer: The correct answer is A. This patient has two primary disturbances. She is dehydrated due to excessive vomiting and she has a metabolic alkalosis from loss of HCl and hypokalemia. Acetazolamide inhibits the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, which is important in the reabsorption of sodium, bicarbonate, and chloride in the proximal tubule. Since it promotes the loss of HCO3 <sup class=\"calibre40\">− </sup> in the urine, it will create a metabolic acidosis that will help balance the patient’s metabolic alkalosis.  \n\n【7】Answer B is incorrect. Ethacrynic acid is a phenoxyacetic acid derivative that essentially has the same action as furosemide. It is used in patients who are likely to be allergic to furosemide, and it is contraindicated in this patient because it will worsen her metabolic alkalosis.  \n\n【8】Answer C is incorrect. Furosemide is a sulfonamide loop diuretic that also causes a metabolic alkalosis. Furosemide is a strong diuretic that inhibits the Na <sup class=\"calibre40\">+ </sup> /K <sup class=\"calibre40\">+ </sup> /2Cl <sup class=\"calibre40\">− </sup> cotransporter of the thick ascending loop of Henle and, like the thiazides, is contraindicated in this patient because it will worsen her metabolic alkalosis.  \n\n【9】Answer D is incorrect. Hydrochlorothiazide inhibits sodium chloride reabsorption in the early distal tubule. It is contraindicated in this patient because it leads to hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, which would only worsen her acid-base balance.  \n\n【10】Answer E is incorrect. Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic that will only remove fluids and will not be beneficial in correcting the patient’s metabolic alkalosis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/12 13:48:09", "endTime": "2024/09/12 13:52:51", "cost": 282.081}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:25", "update_time": "2024-09-11 21:52:52", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 21:48:09"}

The patient was followed at the outpatient wound care cen-ter for several weeks. Split-thickness skin graft of the right leg wound was done on 8/20/14.\n\n【24】·What is your final diagnosis? What is the likely organism causing this infection? The final diagnosis was bacteremia and right leg wound infection， due to Vibrio species. Vibrio species was due to or associated with necrotizing fasciitis and cel-lulitis of the right leg. The infection resulted from laceration of the right leg， the source of entry of the organism. Although the Vibrio was not speciated， it was most likely Vibrio vulnificus.\n\n【25】Comments and discussion\n\n【26】The rapidity of symptom onset in this patient after the leg laceration (18 hours) was a vital clue to the diagnosis. Blood cultures were reported positive within11 hours after blood draw. The gram-negative organism (oxidase positive) grew well in standard media， typical for Vibrio organisms. The Vibrio species isolated in blood and wound was not resistant， but sensitive to all the agents tested. The patient received various antimicrobials， including ceftriaxone and doxycycline， to which the organism was sensitive.\n\n【27】This patient's admission was prolonged， from 6/16 to 6/30/14 (14 days). He was continued on outpatient wound care follow-up for several weeks. Outpatient treatments included UNNA compression wrap of the leg wound as well as wound debridement. Antimicrobial therapy was completed within2-3 weeks after hospital discharge . He had a skin graft for wound closure on8/20/14， about 2 months after the initial admission.\n\n【28】Typically， Vibrio species isolated in our hospital area over the past 15 years have been found to be sensitive to most of the usually available antimicrobials. High resistance would be very unusual. The Vibrio organism isolated in this patient was sensitive to most of the agents tested.\n\n【29】In this patient there was some delay in the initiation of aggressive surgical debridement (3 days) and some delay in the timing of the infectious disease consultation.\n\n【30】Lessons learned from this case\n\n【31】General measures that should be applied to patients with Vibrio sepsis or necro-tizing fasciitis would include the following.\n\n【32】· Blood and wound cultures should be done as soon as possible after admission：these were done in this case.\n\n【33】· Rapid institution of antimicrobial therapy is crucial： this was done.\n\n【34】· Early aggressive surgical debridement should be instituted， and done as often as needed： there was delay in the initial aggressive debridement.\n\n【35】· Fluid resuscitation， metabolic， and other support measures should be pursued.\n\n【36】· Aggressive wound care and debridement as needed： prolonged outpatient wound care is typical， as was the case here.\n\n【37】·Some patients may need hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatment (this patient did not have HBO； however， this was not as important as aggressive surgical debridement).\n\n【38】·Most patients with severe necrotizing fasciitis would need skin grafting， typi-cally weeks after admission， as was the case in this patient.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "删除换行 surgery ×3 in 2013； right inguinal hernia repair ×2 in 1978 and 1990； skin graft right elbow area following heater burn injury at age 14 years； lithotripsy in January， 2014 for right uretero-vesical junction stone， with incomplete stone removal； and appendectomy many years earlier.

The patient was followed at the outpatient wound care cen-ter for several weeks. Split-thickness skin graft of the right leg wound was done on 8/20/14.\n\n【24】·What is your final diagnosis? What is the likely organism causing this infection? The final diagnosis was bacteremia and right leg wound infection， due to Vibrio species. Vibrio species was due to or associated with necrotizing fasciitis and cel-lulitis of the right leg. The infection resulted from laceration of the right leg， the source of entry of the organism. Although the Vibrio was not speciated， it was most likely Vibrio vulnificus.\n\n【25】Comments and discussion\n\n【26】The rapidity of symptom onset in this patient after the leg laceration (18 hours) was a vital clue to the diagnosis. Blood cultures were reported positive within11 hours after blood draw. The gram-negative organism (oxidase positive) grew well in standard media， typical for Vibrio organisms. The Vibrio species isolated in blood and wound was not resistant， but sensitive to all the agents tested. The patient received various antimicrobials， including ceftriaxone and doxycycline， to which the organism was sensitive.\n\n【27】This patient's admission was prolonged， from 6/16 to 6/30/14 (14 days). He was continued on outpatient wound care follow-up for several weeks. Outpatient treatments included UNNA compression wrap of the leg wound as well as wound debridement. Antimicrobial therapy was completed within2-3 weeks after hospital discharge . He had a skin graft for wound closure on8/20/14， about 2 months after the initial admission.\n\n【28】Typically， Vibrio species isolated in our hospital area over the past 15 years have been found to be sensitive to most of the usually available antimicrobials. High resistance would be very unusual. The Vibrio organism isolated in this patient was sensitive to most of the agents tested.\n\n【29】In this patient there was some delay in the initiation of aggressive surgical debridement (3 days) and some delay in the timing of the infectious disease consultation.\n\n【30】Lessons learned from this case\n\n【31】General measures that should be applied to patients with Vibrio sepsis or necro-tizing fasciitis would include the following.\n\n【32】· Blood and wound cultures should be done as soon as possible after admission：these were done in this case.\n\n【33】· Rapid institution of antimicrobial therapy is crucial： this was done.\n\n【34】· Early aggressive surgical debridement should be instituted， and done as often as needed： there was delay in the initial aggressive debridement.\n\n【35】· Fluid resuscitation， metabolic， and other support measures should be pursued.\n\n【36】· Aggressive wound care and debridement as needed： prolonged outpatient wound care is typical， as was the case here.\n\n【37】·Some patients may need hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatment (this patient did not have HBO； however， this was not as important as aggressive surgical debridement).\n\n【38】·Most patients with severe necrotizing fasciitis would need skin grafting， typi-cally weeks after admission， as was the case in this patient.", "index": 2781, "show": true, "start": 2781, "end": 3087, "province": ["语义有效性", "错误删除"], "isEdit": false, "comment": "【6】错误换行，与上面the following： coronary artery bypass graft链接"}], "startTime": "2024/09/12 14:11:04", "endTime": "2024/09/12 14:13:59", "cost": 174.832}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-11 18:39:25", "update_time": "2024-09-11 22:13:59", "grab_time": "2024-09-11 22:11:04"}

It is a highly debilitating disorder of uncertain etiology. Most cases of CFS begin immediately following a period of stress. While some cases start gradually， the majority start suddenly， often triggered by a viral illness. In acute-onset cases， patients report a sudden， drastic start to their illness， some being able to specify the date or even hour of onset. Many people report having the flu， exposure to an allergen， or an infection such as bronchitis， from which they are never able to fully recover and which evolves into CFS. In some instances， patients claim that vaccina-tion， particularly vaccinations against hepatitis B， is the cause of acute-onset CFS. Other patients suffer from Lyme disease before sinking into CFS.\n\n【9】Patients who experience a gradual onset of CFS may not realize there is anything wrong for quite some time. These patients usually do not seek treatment until the condition is truly debilitating. Although CFS can affect people of any gender， age， race， or socioeconomic group， most patients diagnosed with CFS are 25-45 years old and female. Estimates of how many people are afflicted with CFS vary because of the similarity of CFS symptoms to other diseases and the difficulty in identi-fying it. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has estimated that 4-10 people per 100，000 in the United States have CFS. According to the National CFIDS Foundation， about 500，000 adults in the United States (0.3% of the population) have CFS. This probably is a low estimate since these figures do not include children and are based on the CDC definition of CFS used for research purposes， which is very strict. While there is no known cause for CFS， many causes have been proposed. There is evidence that CFS may involve distinct neurological abnormalities， supporting many researchers'classification of CFS as a neurological illness. It is believed that damage to the ascending RAS， an area in the brain that extends upward from the reticular formation and is associated with sleep function， may contribute to onset of CFS. Imaging studies of the brain of CFS patients have shown metabolic abnormalities in the RAS， so it seems likely that damage to this area may be responsible for at least some cases of CFS. This damage may be c AIISeaused by bacterial or viral damage， or an autoimmune attack on the region. Because there 删除换行 is no single identifiable cause for CFS， there is also no single treatment protocol. Frequently， medications such as antidepressants， hormones， and autonomic nervous system stimulants are administered to treat the symptoms of CFS.\n\n【10】APPROACH TO：The Reticular-Activating System\n\n【11】OBJECTIVES\n\n【12】1\\.

The reticular formation is one of the oldest systems in the nervous system. The brains of primitive vertebrates are almost exclusively made up of a reticular formation. Humans retained this formation over the course of evolution as more organized components of the nervous system appeared. The RAS plays several roles， including nonspecific arousal， cortical acti-vation and tone， and regulating sleep and wakefulness. Injury to the reticular system can cause a change in the level of consciousness， ranging from sleepiness to coma. The medullary levels of the RAS control vital respiratory and cardiovascular cen-ters. Defects in these areas can impair respiratory rate， heart rate， and blood pressure.\n\n【19】The RAS has a diffuse arrangement of both ascending and descending neurons that form a system of networks.

The RAS also plays a major role in mediating and filtering ascending and descending sensory and motor information. It is the center of balance for the other systems involved in learning， self-control or inhibition， and motivation. When functioning normally， it provides the neural connections that are needed for the processing and learning of information， and the ability to pay attention to the correct task.\n\n【22】Researchers have hypothesized that the RAS also plays a role in anticipatory responding. It signals the cortex， alerting it to prepare to receive stimuli， allowing it to get into a heightened state of readiness. If the RAS fails to excite the neurons of the cortex as much as it should， the underaroused cortex will result in difficulty learning， poor memory， little self-control， and so on. If the RAS fails completely to stimulate the cortex， the result would be a lack of consciousness. Injury of the RAS is directly associated with coma. In contrast， an overstimulated RAS would arouse the cortex or other systems too much and cause restlessness and hyperactivity.\n\n【23】It is also evident that the RAS is the primary mechanism for turning REM sleep on and off. During wakefulness， the RAS maintains cortical arousal. The high activ-ity in the ascending RAS stimulates the brain through projections into different neu-rological systems in the cortex. However， the midbrain reticular formation becomes activated immediately prior to REM sleep. At this time， the medullary reticular formation spurs a postsynaptic inhibition. This results in a loss of muscle tone.\n\n【24】The reticular formation in general decreases sensory input and reduces motor output during REM sleep. REM sleep-on cells， located in the pontine tegmentum， are particularly active during REM sleep， and are probably responsible for its occurrence.\n\n【25】The release of the monoamine neurotransmitters (norepinephrine， serotonin， and histamine) is completely inhibited during REM. This causes REM atonia， a state in which the motor neurons are not stimulated and thus the body’s muscles do not move.
