His initial hemoglobin is 9 g/dL， white blood cell count (WBC) is 15，500 cells per mm’， and chest x-ray reveals a nonspecific infiltrate in the left lung field with a small left pleural effusion. The electrocardiogram reveals sinus tachycardia. Following treatment with intravenous fluid， supplemental oxygen by nasal canula， parenteral analgesics， and empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics therapy， the patient complained of worsening dyspnea and chest pain， requiring increased oxygen supplementation by face-mask and eventual endotracheal intubation. At this juncture， exchange transfusion therapy is contemplated.\n\n【1】What are the complications associated with blood transfusions in this setting?\n\n【2】What are the ways to reduce the incidence oftransfusion-related complications?\n\n【3】**ANSWERS TO CASE 47：Transfusion Complications**\n\n【4】Summary： A 10-year-old boy with sickle cell crisis associated with severe respira-tory symptoms (acute chest syndrome). The patient continues to have significant respiratory symptoms despite supportive care， and therefore exchange transfusion therapy is considered.\n\n【5】Transfusion complications： Transfusion reactions and transfusion-related infections.\n\n【6】Ways to reduce transfusion complications： Strict adherence to patient identifi-cation， specimen handling， and blood product storage protocols， and thorough review of transfusion history. Transfuse blood products based on need rather than arbitrary transfusion triggers.\n\n【7】**ANALYSIS**\n\n【8】_Objectives_\n\n【9】1\\. Develop an understanding of the epidemiology and basic pathophysiology of transfusion reactions.\n\n【10】2\\. Learn the evaluation and treatment of acute， life-threatening transfusion complications.\n\n【11】3\\. Learn the indications for blood product transfusion.\n\n【12】**_Considerations_**\n\n【13】Because sickle cell disease predisposes the patient to chronic anemia， it is more than likely that this particular patient has had an extensive history of transfusions； therefore， a thorough review of the transfusion history is vital. If the patient or the medical records indicate prior occurrence of minor transfusion reactions， then premedication with antihistamines and/or antipyretics may be useful. As a group， patients who are homozygous for sickle hemoglobin are at markedly increased risk of suffering complications from transfusion therapy including transfusion-related infections (approximately 10% are infected with hepatitis C virus)， and non-infectious etiologies related to alloimmunization (affecting up to 50% of sickle cell patients). The increased risks of alloimmunization are primarily related to recurrent antigen exposure and phenotypic dissimilarities between blood cells in the predomi-nately white-donated blood supply and African American sickle cell patients.\n\n【14】To reduce the risk of transfusion-related complications， blood banks have intensi-fied the cross-matching process for transfusions in sickle cell patients， with a demon-strable decrease in rates of alloimmunization. Leukocyte-reduced packed red blood cells (PRBC) are recommended for patients with sickle cell disease and other patients requiring recurrent transfusions. Additional benefits include a reduced rate of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alloimmunization， and possible decreased rates of febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions (FNHTRs).\n\n【15】**APPROACH TO：Transfusion Complications**\n\n【16】**CLINICAL APPROACH**\n\n【17】Conceptually， transfusion complications are best categorized into acute immune-mediated reactions， delayed immune-mediated reactions， nonimmunologic compli-cations， and infectious complications.\n\n【18】_Acute Hemolytic Transfusion Reactions_\n\n【19】Acute hemolytic transfusion reactions occur in 1：25，000 transfusions and cause death in 1：470，000 transfusions. The majority of acute hemolytic transfusion reactions are due to errors made during the processing of the blood， either at the patient bedside or in the blood bank. The majority of these reactions may be avoided with meticu-lous specimen processing， patient identification， and transfusion guidelines. Onset of reaction is immediate， presenting with a combination of hypotension， tachypnea(often with the sensation of chest constriction)， tachycardia， fever， chills， nausea， hemoglobinuria， and body pain (joints， lower back， legs). Hemolysis can be either intravascular (more severe) or extravascular and is directed toward donor red blood cells (RBCs)， usually mediated by preformed antibodies (anti-A， anti-B) within the recipient's serum. Because the causative antibodies to ABO group antigens are pre-existing in susceptible individuals， no prior alloantigen exposure is necessary for acute hemolysis to occur. However， recent sensitization to other alloantigens (such as an Rh-negative patient being exposed to Rh-positive blood) can result in similar pathology if a subsequent blood transfusion contains the same alloantigen(s). Given the potential for new alloantibody formation， a blood sample from the recipient should only be used for cross-matching assays within 48 hours from the time of collection.\n\n【20】Immediate management of suspected cases includes stopping the transfusion and changing the IV tubing or using alternative access sites to initiate aggressive crystal-loid infusions， aiming to maintain urine output above 1 to 1.5 mL/kg/h for 24 hours. The remainder of the transfusion and a sample of the patient’s blood should be sent to the blood bank for testing. The sequelae of acute hemolysis include acute tubular necrosis (ATN)， disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)， and myocardial ischemia (as a consequence of hemodynamic instability). DIC may be confirmed by the presence of hemoglobinuria and plasma-free hemoglobin. The definitive diag-nosis of acute hemolytic transfusion reactions is made with direct antiglobulin test(DAT， also known as the direct Coombs assay)， which detects antibody or comple-ment bound to the surface of donor RBCs in a sample of the recipient’s blood.\n\n【21】_Febrile Nonhemolytic Transfusion Reactions_\n\n【22】These reactions occur with approximately 0.5% to 1% RBC units， 2% apheresis platelet unit， and 5% to 30% donor-pooled platelets. Febrile nonhemolytic trans-fusion reactions (FNHTR) constitute the most common and least-worrisome\n\n【23】**complications of blood product transfusion. Patients may present with fever， chills， rigors， headache， malaise， and tachycardia， but without hemodynamic instability and respiratory compromise. Because prior history of transfusion is required for this reaction， fever in a first-time transfusion recipient should be treated as an acute hemolytic reaction until proven otherwise. Conversely， prior episodes of FNHTR indicate an increased risk of recurrence.**\n\n【24】Management may include stopping the transfusion， administration of an anti-pyretic， and patient reassurance. Patients with a history of febrile reactions can be premedicated with antipyretics. Antipyretic premedication is a matter of preference， but should be generally avoided in first-time transfusion recipients， because fever is more likely to represent serious sequelae in these patients. Because FNHTR is a diagnosis of exclusion， samples of patient’s blood and the transfusate should be sent to rule out a hemolytic reaction or bacterial contamination.\n\n【25】_Allergic Transfusion Reactions_\n\n【26】The incidence of these allergic reactions is 1% to 3% of transfusions， and the reac-tions are caused by recipient antibodies (immunoglobulin \\[Ig\\] E) against donor serum proteins； symptoms may range from urticaria to frank anaphylaxis. Urticaria can be managed symptomatically with antihistamines and by briefly stopping the transfusion until symptoms resolve. Mild allergic reactions do not necessitate dis-continuing the transfusion， as symptoms are not strictly dose related. Patients prone to develop these reactions can be premedicated with antihistamines to prevent the development of mild allergic reactions.\n\n【27】Frankly， anaphylactic reactions to blood products are rare (1：20，000 to 1：170，000) and can occur within seconds of transfusion initiation. Anaphylactic reactions are IgE-mediated and occur， in most cases， as the result of genetic deficiency of IgA in the recipient， resulting in the production of anti-IgA， -IgE. Other less-common causes of anaphylaxis include reactions caused by IgE against allergens in the trans-fused blood， and the passive transfer of reactive IgE from donor to the recipient. Patients with known IgA deficiency should be given RBCs and platelets that have been thoroughly washed free of plasma proteins. Plasma component trans-fusions in IgA-deficient patients should be obtained from IgA-deficient donors.\n\n【28】Anaphylaxis should be managed by immediately addressing the ABCs (airway， breathing， circulation)， accompanied by the administration of epinephrine， anti-histamines， and corticosteroids， along with the immediate discontinuation of the transfusion. Patients taking angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors will have more severe anaphylactic reactions (ie， severe angioedema) because of their inability to degrade bradykinin.\n\n【29】_Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury_\n\n【30】Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI)， with an estimated incidence of1：4500 transfusions， is an under-recognized life-threatening complication of trans-fusion. TRALI is thought to be mediated by anti-leukocyte antibodies，resulting in systemic inflammation and neutrophil-mediated lung injury. The onset is generally within 6 hours of exposure to plasma-containing transfusion products， with most cases occurring within 1 to 2 hours. Random donor platelet transfusions (pooled\n\n【31】platelets) are responsible for the majority of cases. Patients with hematological malignancies and cardiac disease are at increased risk of developing TRALI. Fever， tachycardia， and dyspnea are the most common presenting symptoms. The hallmark of this complication is respiratory distress with the presence of diffuse， bilateral alveolar and interstitial infiltrates on radiographic imaging. TRALI may be easily confused with acute pulmonary edema secondary to volume overload. Because TRALI patients have normal to low left-heart pressures， echocardiography may be useful to differentiate between TRALI and pulmonary edema. The manage-ment of this condition consists of stopping the transfusion and immediate attention to the“ABCs，\"which may include intubation and mechanical ventilation. Respira-tory compromise is usually self-limiting within 48 to 72 hours. The mortality rate associated with TRALI is about 10%.\n\n【32】**DELAYED IMMUNE-MEDIATED REACTIONS**\n\n【33】_Delayed Hemolytic Transfusion Reactions_\n\n【34】Delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions (DHTRs) are notably less severe than their acute hemolytic counterparts. The incidence is about 1：1000 transfusions. The mechanisms of DHTR are related to recipients having developed antibodies against RBC alloantigens from prior foreign RBC exposures， most often through transfu-sions or pregnancies.\n\n【35】Unlike acute hemolytic reactions， which require high circulating levels of reac-tive antibodies， the alloantibodies responsible for DHTR are present only at low levels prior to transfusion. Following exposure to these alloantigens， antibody gen-eration is slowly increased over the following days， resulting in hemolysis of the donor RBCs. Symptoms associated with DHTR are mild to nonexistent. Patients typically present with a mild fever and recurrent anemia. No specific therapy is warranted aside from repeat transfusion.\n\n【36】_Graft-Versus-Host Disease_\n\n【37】Transfusion-related graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a rare disorder where donor lymphocytes engraft and proliferate in the recipient's bone marrow， which over time may lead to a severe graft-mediated reaction against the recipient's tissues， includ-ing the bone marrow. It is fatal in more than 90% of cases. Symptoms of GVHD develop on average 1 to 2 weeks following transfusion and include fevers， maculo-papular rashes， hepatitis， diarrhea， nausea， vomiting， weight loss， and pancytopenia leading to sepsis and death. Immunocompromised recipients are especially at risk for GVHD； therefore， blood products administered to these patients should be subjected to gamma irradiation to render remaining leukocytes incapable of proliferation. Blood products donated by first-degree relatives or between patients with partially matched HLA haplotypes have an increased risk of donor lympho-cyte engraftment because of homology between donor and recipient HLA genes； therefore， blood product donated by first-degree relatives should be irradiated prior to transfusions. The highest incidence of GVHD has been from regions where the population is racially homogeneous with highly likelihood of shared\n\n【38】HLA haplotype (eg， Japan). GVHD is most problematic when patients receive fresh blood that is processed within 7 days from time of collection. In the United C.....1.1States， blood products that are older than 7 days generally do not contain viable lymphocytes.\n\n【39】_Post-transfusion Purpura_\n\n【40】Post-transfusion purpura is a rare complication， characterized by sudden thrombo-cytopenia occurring 5 to 10 days following transfusion of any blood product. The pathophysiology involves native platelet destruction， mediated by antibodies to the platelet antigen (PLA)1. Anti-PLA1 antibodies develop in patients previously exposed to foreign platelets through transfusion or pregnancy. Patients usually present with spontaneous bleeding (mucous membranes， epistaxis， hematochezia， hematuria). Nine percent of patients may develop intracranial hemorrhage. Treatment involves administration of intravenous immunoglobulin， corticosteroids， plasma exchange therapy， and transfusion with PLA1-negative platelets. If left untreated， the thrombocytopenia usually resolves spontaneously within 2 weeks of onset.\n\n【41】**_Alloimmunization_**\n\n【42】Alloimmunization refers to the formation of new antibodies against antigens on donated cells. The formation of alloantibodies against HLA surface molecules may render patients refractory to platelet transfusions， thus supporting the admin-istration of leukoreduced blood for patients who will likely need exogenous plate-lets in the future. The presence of alloantibodies is primarily responsible for the increased rates of transfusion complications seen in repeat transfusion recipients.\n\n【43】_Infectious Complications_\n\n【44】The most frequent and concerning infectious complication of transfusion therapy\n\n【45】is bacterial contamination， which can be detected in up to 2% of blood products. The most commonly isolated organism in refrigerated products (ie， RBCs) is Yersinia enterocolitica， which can grow at temperatures as low as 1℃(33.8°F). Other cryophilic organisms include Pseudomonas， Enterobacter and Flavobacterium. Platelets， which are stored at room temperature (22°C-24°℃\\[71.6°F-75.2°F)， are more likely to develop gross contamination than are refrigerated products. Staphylococcus and Salmonella are often reported in fatal cases of platelet transfusion-mediated sepsis. Signs and symptoms may include fevers， rigors， chills， rash， hypotension， and even shock accompanied by sepsis. Symptoms may develop immediately or over several hours. Suspected cases of contamination should be managed with respiratory and circulatory support， immediate discontinuation of the transfusion， and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. Because it is difficult to distinguish some of the immune-mediated transfusion reactions from bacterial transmission， any transfusion that causes hypotension in the setting of fever warrants immediate testing of the donor blood with Gram stain and culture， in addition to standard workup for hemolytic reactions.\n\n【46】_Indications for Blood Products_\n\n【47】Given the potential complications from blood product transfusion， it is imperative that physicians understand and follow the indications for blood transfusion. The transfusion of blood products is indicated in patients with acute blood loss associ-ated with hemodynamic instability and those with large amount of ongoing blood loss in hemodynamically stable individuals. The use of transfusion triggers had been a common practice in the past； however， based on the findings of a randomized controlled clinical trial (TRICC trial)， hospitalized patients maintained at a hemo-globin values of 7 to 9 g/dL had lower in-hospital mortality than those maintained at hemoglobin values of 10 to 12 g/dL. The findings of the TRICC trial demonstrated that critically ill patients (with the exception of patients with acute coronary syn-drome) can tolerate much lower hemoglobin levels， and the transfusion of packed RBC should be determined based on patients' needs rather than an arbitrary labora-tory value. Platelet transfusion is generally indicated in patients with platelet count of less than 10，000 uL， 10，000 to 20，000 with bleeding， less than 50，000 with a severe trauma， and those with bleeding time greater than 15 minutes. Fresh-frozen plasma transfusion is considered appropriate in bleeding patients with prothrombin time more than 17 seconds and following massive transfusion where replacement of 1 unit of fresh-frozen plasma and one single donor platelet unit for each unit of PRBC transfused is recommended as a strategy to improve clotting and hemostasis(hemostatic resuscitation).\n", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The main \n\n【23】differential diagnoses to consider are:\n\n【24】• ventilatory failure due to respiratory muscle weakness\n\n【25】• pneumonia, including due to aspiration and particularly in those who have received \n\n【26】immunosuppression\n\n【27】• interstitial lung disease\n\n【28】• pulmonary embolus due to immobility.\n\n【29】The clinical features in this case (fever and findings consistent with pneumonia), on a \n\n【30】background of profound immunosuppression, would make pneumonia the most likely \n\n【31】explanation for her deterioration. Infection is a significant problem in this patient popu￾lation: respiratory muscle weakness may lead to atelectasis and collapse which increase \n\n【32】the risk of infection. In addition, her orophayngeal muscles may be involved, leading to \n\n【33】aspiration. Although interstitial lung disease occurs in 5–10 per cent of dermatomyositis \n\n【34】patients, it typically develops more insidiously and presents with late or pan-inspiratory \n\n【35】crackles that do not clear with coughing (such clearing would be more suggestive of \n\n【36】transmitted sounds from upper airway secretions). Although she is on thromboprophy￾laxis which reduces the chance of pulmonary embolus and there is no history of pleuritic \n\n【37】chest pain or haemoptysis and her JVP is normal, thromboembolism should always be \n\n【38】considered.\n\n【39】Appropriate immediate investigations include:\n\n【40】• arterial blood gas to assess respiratory failure\n\n【41】• blood cultures to assess for infection\n\n【42】• chest X-ray looking for features of bronchopneumonia, collapse or interstitial lung \n\n【43】disease\n\n【44】• spirometry to assess reduction in vital capacity.\n\n【45】It would be appropriate to commence broad-spectrum antibiotics intravenously to cover \n\n【46】for aspiration and nosocomial infection (advice should be sought from local microbiology \n\n【47】services).

This 35-year-old male patient has experienced exercise-induced AF， and likely passed blood clots from the heart to the brain. The change in heart rhythm from AF back to normal sinus rhythm (NSR) produced and released a clot， provoking the neurological symptoms. This clot could have been generated either in the left atrium or the right atrium (atrial septal defect， ASD) reach ing the arterial circulation. This patient experienced paroxysmal AF when he developed a blood clot， likely in the atrial appendage， which was pumped out of the heart and reached his cerebral circulation. Should the patient's neurological symptoms resolve， this patient is classified as a transient ischemic attack (TIA) in which blood flow to a certain area of the brain was intermittently decreased. If neurological deficits persist， a stroke is diagnosed， anda repeat CT of the brain at 48 hours should reveal a hypodense area in the part of the brain involved. The patient will need a 24-hour Holter monitor to document the atrial fibrilla-tion. Paroxysmal AF is the most dangerous arrhythmia because of the constant transition from arrhythmia to NSR， which increases the risk of stroke by placing blood clots into the circulatory system. This patient will initially need 3 to6 months of anticoagulation therapy along with medication to control his heart rhythm. Evaluation for AF in a young patient should be undertaken (hyperthy-roidism， drugs). Examining the need for long-term anticoagulation therapy in the context of benefits versus risk of paroxysmal atrial AF associated with the formation of blood clots is indicated. Maintaining NSR and preventing sponta neous， infrequent AF is foremost in this patient.\n\n【14】32.2 B. The patient has developed multiple thrombi and blood clots secondary to a hypercoagulable condition. Some potential causes include Factor V Leiden disorder， pregnancy， and lupus anticoagulant. Many undiagnosed blood disor-ders are discovered during pregnancy. One clue that this patient has a hyper-coagulable condition is that she has had 2 previous miscarriages. The higher than normal estrogen state of pregnancy triggers hypercoagulability risk factors in patients with clotting disorders like Factor V Leiden， protein C and S， and antithrombin III. This patient developed a DVT while sitting for a prolonged period of time at the movie theater. The patient's neurological symptoms are caused by her hypercoagulable state which contributes to the development of thrombi and emboli that have entered into the microcirculation of the cere-bral vasculature. Admission to the ICU and complete hematological panel to determine the diagnosis of her blood clotting disorder is indicated. A hema-tology and obstetrical consultation is also warranted. The immediate therapy is anticoagulation with heparin or enoxaparin (Lovenox， an injectable Xa inhibitor). The use of warfarin (Coumadin) is contraindicated in pregnancy， as it is teratogenic. Long-term anticoagulation is needed. Lupus anticoagulant usually presents as prolonged prothrombin time (PTT) without evidence of bleeding， in which case， the PTT gets further prolonged when mixed with half-normal plasma confirms the presence of a factor antibody (antiphospho-lipid). A factor deficiency causing the PTT prolongation would correct when mixed with normal plasma.\n\n【15】**", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

This morning， his wife found him unresponsiveand extremely agitated. Currently， the patient is flailing his limbs and is unresponsive to stimuli or toverbal commands. His pupils are equal and reactive. The patient is sedated， and a CT of the headdemonstrates a large lesion in the right frontal lobe. MRI establishes the likely diagnosis.  |\n| --- |\n| What is the differential diagnosis of a brain lesion? Neoplastic causes： ●·The most common brain tumor is a metastatic lesion (secondary tumor—lung， breast， melanoma， etc).●Primary brain tumors include gliomas， meningiomas， pituitary adenomas， vestibular schwannomas， andprimary central nervous system lymphomas. Nonneoplastic causes： · Infectious (eg， abscess， viral， progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy， toxoplasmosis， or cysticercosis).·Vascular (cerebral hemorrhage or infarct). · Inflammatory (associated with multiple sclerosis or postinfectious encephalopathy).  |\n| What is the most likely diagnosis? Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). MRI is the definitive test fora brain mass. Gliomas appear hypointense on T1-weightedimaging (Figure 8-10) and hyperintense on T2-weightedimaging. They also heterogeneously enhance with contrastand can be distinguished from the surrounding edema. Therapidity of onset of this patient’s symptoms without signs of infarct suggests a malignant process. FIGURE 8-10. Glioblastoma multiforme. (Reproduced， withpermission， from Ropper， AH， Samuels MA. Adam's and Victor'sPrinciples of Neurology，9th ed. New York： McGraw-Hill， 2009：Figure 31-2.\\]  |\n| What are some characteristics of this condition? GBM is the most commonly diagnosed primary brain tumor. It is a grade IV astrocytoma that is mostcommonly found in adults， in contrast to the peak childhood prevalence of low-grade (pilocytic)astrocytoma. GBM is typically found in the cerebral hemispheres and can cross the corpus callosum toform the characteristic “butterfly glioma.\"  |\n| What are the most common signs and symptoms associated with this condition?·SSymptoms of GBM include headache (73%-86% of cases) and seizures (26%-32% of cases).●Signs of GBM include paraparesis， papilledema， confusion， and aphasia.  |\n| What is the appropriate treatment for this condition?The prognosis for GBM is poor； most patients do not survive beyond 1 year of diagnosis. The initialtreatment is resection. Adjuvant radiation therapy with chemotherapy (with nitrosoureas and temozolomide)is the current standard of care. Dexamethasone is used to alleviate the vasogenic edema that that is causedby blood-brain barrier disruption that occurs in the area around many brain tumors. Dexamethasone ispreferred over other steroids because its relative lack of mineralocorticoid activity decreases the risk offluid retention.  |", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

When asked to walk \n\n【21】she is a little slow to get started and has difficulty stopping and turning.\n\n【22】Questions\n\n【23】•\t What is the diagnosis?\n\n【24】•\t How would you investigate and manage this patient?100 Cases in Clinical Medicine\n\n【25】238\n\n【26】ANSWER 95\n\n【27】There is evidence in the history and examination of tremor, rigidity and bradykinesia. Her \n\n【28】writing shows micrographia secondary to the rigidity and slowness of movement. Her \n\n【29】hypertension is well controlled on the beta-blocker. Beta-blockers can cause tiredness and \n\n【30】slowness but not to the extent seen in this woman. This woman has Parkinson’s disease \n\n【31】presenting with the classic triad of tremor, rigidity and hypokinesia. Tremor is usually an \n\n【32】early symptom and may be unilateral. The combination of tremor with rigidity leads to the \n\n【33】cogwheel form of rigidity. The patient often goes on to have a blank mask-like facies. There \n\n【34】is difficulty starting to walk (freezing), and the patient uses small steps and has difficulty \n\n【35】stopping (festination). There is generally normal intellectual function, but there is often \n\n【36】depression. Sleep is often disturbed, contributing to daytime tiredness. The characteristic \n\n【37】pathological abnormality is degeneration of dopamine-secreting neurones in the nigrostria￾tal pathway of the basal ganglia.\n\n【38】Parkinsonian features (parkinsonism) may occur in a variety of diseases:\n\n【39】•\t Parkinson’s disease\n\n【40】•\t postencephalitic parkinsonism\n\n【41】•\t neuroleptic drug-induced Parkinson’s disease\n\n【42】•\t parkinsonism in association with Alzheimer’s/multi-infarct dementia.\n\n【43】! Classification of tremor\n\n【44】•\t Rest tremor: the tremor is worse at rest and is typical of parkinsonism.\n\n【45】•\t Postural tremor: this is characteristic of benign essential tremor, physiological \n\n【46】tremor and exaggerated physiological tremor caused by anxiety, alcohol and thy￾rotoxicosis. Benign essential tremor is not present at rest, but appears on holding \n\n【47】the arms outstretched, but is not worse on movement (finger–nose testing). Tests \n\n【48】of coordination are normal, and walking is unaffected. There is usually a family his￾tory of tremor, and the tremor is helped by alcohol and beta-blockers.\n\n【49】•\t Intention tremor: the tremor is worse on movement and is most obvious in finger–\n\n【50】nose testing. It is usually caused by brainstem or cerebellar disease caused by such \n\n【51】diseases as multiple sclerosis, localized tumours or spinocerebellar degeneration.\n\n【52】A variety of drugs are available to treat this woman’s Parkinson’s disease. Selegiline, an \n\n【53】inhibitor of monoamine oxidase B, may delay the need to start levodopa and may slow the \n\n【54】rate of progression of the disease but has significant side effects. Levodopa is usually used in \n\n【55】combination with a selective dopa decarboxylase inhibitor, which does not cross the blood–\n\n【56】brain barrier and reduces peripheral adverse effects. The commonest side effects are nausea, \n\n【57】vomiting, dizziness, postural hypotension and neuropsychiatric problems. After many years \n\n【58】of treatment the effects tend to diminish, and the patient may develop rapid oscillations in \n\n【59】control—the ‘on–off’ effect. When these develop, a sustained-release formulation of levodopa \n\n【60】or a dopamine agonist (e.g. bromocriptine) may produce improvement. Because of the loss of \n\n【61】effect with time, treatment should not be started too early. This requires careful discussion \n\n【62】with the individual patient. She should be assessed by a physiotherapist and occupational \n\n【63】therapist and provided with advice and aids.

Would management change if he had presented 3 hours after development of \n\n【30】symptoms?50\n\n【31】100 Cases in Emergency Medicine and Critical Care\n\n【32】DISCUSSION\n\n【33】This patient has significant cardiac risk factors (smoking, diabetes and hypertension) and \n\n【34】presents with acute cardiac-sounding chest pain. Based on the presentation, the treating phy￾sician must consider myocardial ischaemia or infarction as the most important diagnosis to \n\n【35】exclude, and a 12-lead ECG must be obtained immediately in all such patients. Often, the \n\n【36】paramedics will have performed a 12 lead ECG, and this must be interpreted if available.\n\n【37】In this case, the ECG shows ST elevation in the inferior leads (II, III and F) as well as recip￾rocal ST depression in the anterior and lateral leads. This finding, together with the history, \n\n【38】is concerning for an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), which is a medical emer￾gency. The finding of ECG changes in leads II, III and aVF points towards inferior or poste￾rior wall ischaemia/infarction.\n\n【39】The initial steps to managing this patient should proceed along the ‘ABCDE’ approach. \n\n【40】Supplemental oxygen was traditionally provided even to non-hypoxic patients, but recent \n\n【41】evidence suggests it does not provide any benefit and may even harm such individuals. Given \n\n【42】the presence of hypotension and possible right ventricular involvement and the absence of \n\n【43】signs to suggest pulmonary oedema, an intravenous fluid bolus (250–500 mL) should be \n\n【44】administered. Concomitantly, basic blood tests including a full blood count, electrolytes, \n\n【45】coagulation screen and troponin must be performed. A chest radiograph is also useful to look \n\n【46】for pulmonary oedema, estimate the heart size and exclude thoracic dissection. Pain should \n\n【47】be controlled, with morphine being preferred due to its potency and rapid onset of action, \n\n【48】and nitrate should also be used, dependent on blood pressure.\n\n【49】The most important goal of the acute management of STEMI is coronary reperfusion, which \n\n【50】may be achieved either by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or use of fibrinolytic \n\n【51】agents (thrombolysis). PCI is the preferred strategy if it can be delivered within 120 minutes \n\n【52】of first medical contact (and ideally within 90 minutes), and would be the best option in this \n\n【53】individual. Hospitals may have a STEMI alert/paging system to enable deployment of the \n\n【54】primary PCI team, and this should be activated. Prior to PCI, antiplatelet therapy should be \n\n【55】administered with a loading dose of aspirin (300 mg) as well as a second anti-platelet agent \n\n【56】(e.g. ticagrelor 180 mg or clopidogrel 300 mg).\n\n【57】If there is a delay in presentation to the Emergency Department (e.g. 3 hours after symptom \n\n【58】onset), PCI is still the preferred option providing it can be delivered within 120 minutes of \n\n【59】first patient contact (i.e. door to balloon time). Only if there is an anticipated delay in provi￾sion of PCI of >2 hours from first patient contact (e.g. if the patient initially presents to a dis￾trict hospital without primary PCI capabilities and requires transfer to another centre, with \n\n【60】an expected travel time >2 hours) should fibrinolysis be chosen as the reperfusion strategy. \n\n【61】This is because several randomised trials have shown that PCI provides improved short- and \n\n【62】long-term survival outcomes compared to fibrinolysis, providing it can be performed within \n\n【63】the appropriate time frame.51\n\n【64】Case 14: Crushing central chest pain\n\n【65】Key Points\n\n【66】• >1 mm ST elevation in anatomically contiguous lead locations should raise suspi￾cion for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).\n\n【67】• Any patient with a suspected STEMI should be considered for emergent coronary \n\n【68】reperfusion via percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).\n\n【69】• Prior to PCI, dual anti-platelet therapy, with aspirin 300 mg and either clopidogrel \n\n【70】300 mg or ticagrelor 180 mg, should be administered.\n\n【71】• The alternative to PCI is thrombolysis, but PCI is preferred providing it can be per￾formed within 120 minutes of first patient contact.http://taylorandfrancis.com53\n\n【72】INTERNAL MEDICINE\n\n【73】", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The sequence of the mRNA is “read” in units of three nucleotides called codons . Most of the 64 possible codons “code” for an amino acid; however, three of the codons, the stop codons, serve as signals for the termination of protein synthesis. One codon, the AUG start codon , signals the point where protein synthesis begins. The start codon is significant because it establishes the reading frame for the ribosome.\n\n【4】▪ Outline the steps involved in transcription of a gene.\n\n【5】▪ Research/review mRNA processing from the primary transcript to the mature mRNA.\n\n【6】▪ Outline the steps involved in translation of an mRNA.\n\n【7】▪ What amino acid does the AUG codon code for? What conclusion can you make about ALL proteins?\n\n【8】▪ Demonstrate the concept of a reading frame using a simple sentence.\n\n【9】Background\n----------\n\n【10】A cell requires a vast constellation of proteins in order to function. Many of these are enzymes, proteins that catalyze a reaction. One example of a critically important enzyme is DNA ligase . As its name implies, a DNA ligase functions to join two pieces of DNA. DNA ligase I specifically functions to ligate short strands of DNA, known as Okazaki fragments, which are formed during the process of DNA replication. In the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae , DNA ligase I is encoded by the gene CDC9 . The protein product of this gene, CDC9 <sub>p </sub> , is synthesized in the cytoplasm before entering the nucleus where it can interact with the cell’s DNA.\n\n【11】The nucleus is not the only place in a yeast cell where DNA can be found. Yeast have mitochondria and mitochondria have their own DNA. Mitochondrial DNA must replicate in order to maintain the genome of mitochondria as they undergo binary fission and are segregated into daughter cells following yeast mitotic cell division. Analysis of the genome of S. cerevisiae suggests that CDC9 is the only gene for DNA ligase I. How can a single gene produce two proteins that maintain the same function but are located in two very different organelles? Several mitochondrial proteins are encoded by genes located in the nucleus and are synthesized in the cell’s cytoplasm. Mitochondrial presequences direct these proteins to be imported into the mitochondria. Once the protein enters the mitochondria, a mitochondrial presequence peptidase (MPP), binds to the consensus amino acid sequence ARFFT and cleaves off the presequence.\n\n【12】▪ Brainstorm a list of other proteins and their functions in a cell.\n\n【13】▪ Research/review DNA replication. Identify the role of Okazaki fragments.\n\n【14】▪ Predict whether DNA replication could proceed in the absence of DNA ligase I.\n\n【15】▪ How can a protein move from the cytoplasm into the nucleus?\n\n【16】▪ Mitochondria possess a circular molecule of DNA that replicates in the same manner as the linear DNA found in the eukaryotic nucleus. Discuss the evolutionary significance of these two observations.\n\n【17】▪ Compare and contrast the process of binary fission and mitosis.\n\n【18】▪ Speculate on the consequences to the cell of the loss of mitochondrial DNA replication.\n\n【19】▪ Compare and contrast the import of proteins into mitochondria with the import of proteins into the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER).\n\n【20】Methods\n-------\n\n【21】### Yeast culture conditions\n\n【22】All yeast strains used in this study were derived from a single wild-type strain, W303. Yeast cultures were grown on YPD media (2% peptone, 1% yeast extract, 2% glucose) supplemented with appropriate amino acids. Mitochondrial function was assessed by plating cells on YPEG media (2% peptone, 1% yeast extract, 3% glycerol, 3% ethanol).\n\n【23】### CDC9–GFP fusions, CDC9 mutagenesis, and HA tagging\n\n【24】Plasmids containing various lengths of the amino terminus of the CDC9 gene were fused in-frame with the gene for green fluorescence protein (GFP). Site-directed mutagenesis was used to alter AUG sequences in the CDC9 gene. The first AUG site was converted to UAG and the second was changed to GCG. Changes to the DNA sequence were confirmed by sequencing. A human influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag was added to the CDC9 gene using transposon mutagenesis. A triple HA tag was inserted at position 75 in the amino acid sequence of CDC9 (CDC9–HA). It was determined that the insert did not affect the growth rates of the cells.\n\n【25】### Subcellular fractionation and protease K digestion\n\n【26】Yeast were harvested by centrifugation (5 min at 3000 g ), washed in distilled water and resuspended in buffer and incubated at 30°C for 10 min. Zymolase 5000 (5 mg/g of cell, wet weight) was added to the suspension and incubated at 30°C with gentle shaking. Yeast spheroplasts were harvested by centrifugation (5 min at 3000 rpm). Spheroplasts were resuspended in buffer and disrupted using a Dounce homogenizer on ice. The cell homogenate was centrifuged (5 min at 3500 rpm) and the supernatant was saved. A crude mitochondrial fraction was collected by centrifugation of the supernatant at 9000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. The mitochondrial pellet was washed twice and the postmitochondrial supernatant was saved.\n\n【27】Yeast nuclei were prepared from spheroplasts that were homogenized as described earlier. The cell homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min at 4°C to remove unbroken cells and cell debris. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and the nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 g for 25 min at 4°C. The pellet was resuspended in a small amount of buffer and layered on top of a sucrose gradient. The sample was centrifuged using a swing bucket rotor at 25,000 rpm for 60 min at 4°C. Intact nuclei pelleted, leaving other cellular material in the overlying sucrose layers of the gradient.\n\n【28】Proteinase K treatment of isolated mitochondria or nuclei was carried out by adding an equal volume of 500 μg/mL proteinase K. Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 0.5%. After incubation at 0°C for 30 min, proteins were precipitated by incubation with TCA.\n\n【29】### Immunoblotting\n\n【30】Protein samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. Antiserum directed against yeast Hsp60 was used at a 1:10,000 dilution, anti-NpI3 antiserum at 1:3,000 dilution, anti-GFP antiserum at 1:1,000 dilution, and anti-HA monoclonal antibody at 1:1,000 dilution. Secondary HRP-conjugated antirabbit and antimouse antibodies were used at 1:1000 dilution.\n\n【31】▪ What is a “wild-type” cell?\n\n【32】▪ Create a flow chart that summarizes the steps used in the subcellular fractionation of yeast cells.\n\n【33】▪ What was the final concentration of proteinase K used in the digestion assays?\n\n【34】Results\n-------\n\n【35】▪ Label the methionine amino acids representing the AUG codons in Figure 3.2.1 a AUG1, AUG2, AUG3, and AUG4.

Match the bands to the fusion protein constructs shown in Figure 3.2.2 a.\n\n【43】▪ Use the data presented in Figure 3.2.2 a and b to develop an argument in support of the statement, “the 30.3 kDa form in pMW197-containing cells cannot be the product of initiation at AUG3, but rather it must be a proteolytic product of the full-length polypeptide expressed from AUG1.”\n\n【44】▪ What evidence is used in Figure 3.2.2 c to support the conclusion that CDC9–GFP protein is imported into mitochondria?\n\n【45】▪ Based on the data presented in Figure 3.2.3 , has the addition of an HA tag altered the behavior of the CDC9 protein?\n\n【46】▪ Which organelle, mitochondria or nuclei, would travel farther into a sucrose gradient during sucrose gradient density centrifugation? Explain your answer.\n\n【47】▪ Propose an explanation for the presence of antibody staining in lanes 2–4 in Figure 3.2.3 b.\n\n【48】▪ Which of the lanes in Figure 3.2.4 a supports the conclusion that CDC9–HA is inside the mitochondria?

Justify your answer.\n\n【51】▪ Propose an explanation for the results shown in Figure 3.2.4 d and f.\n\n【52】▪ Explain why the mitochondrial form of CDC9–HA is smaller than the nuclear form as shown in Figure 3.2.5 .

What do you observe? Propose an explanation for your observation.\n\n【56】▪ How would the mutations used in the experiment shown in Figure 3.2.6 (AUG1 changed to UAG; AUG2 changed to GCG) alter the CDC9 protein?\n\n【57】▪ Immunoblot analysis of the mutant cells shown in Figure 3.2.6 yielded the following results: (1) the upper band of the CDC9–HA doublet was missing from the AUG2–GCG mutant cells. (2) The lower band of the CDC9–HA doublet was missing from the AUG1–UAG mutant cells.\n\n【58】▪ Develop an argument for or against the conclusion that synthesis of the mitochondrial and nuclear forms of CDC9 is initiated at two different AUG sequences.\n\n【59】▪ The experiment described was presented as “data not shown” in the original paper. Discuss whether the absence of an image of the blot influences your confidence in the conclusion.\n\n【60】▪ Yeast cells were able to undergo cellular division in the absence of a functional AUG2 start codon (AUG2–GCG; Figure 3.2.6 ). Develop a hypothesis to account for the ability of yeast cells to progress through multiple rounds of the cell cycle in the absence of AUG2.\n\n【61】Figure 3.2.1 Amino acid sequence of CDC9.  \na.

She went to see her general \n\n【4】practitioner for an explanation. She has no history of trauma. She reports she has diffi￾culty achieving a full range of movement of the finger and complains of painful clicking \n\n【5】of the finger when she tries to make a fist.\n\n【6】Examination\n\n【7】This woman’s finger remains flexed at the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint even \n\n【8】when she tries to unclench her fist (Fig. 48.1), but with further effort the finger sud￾denly extends fully with a snap. At the level of the distal palmar crease she has a nodule \n\n【9】that is tender to palpation over the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint. On attempting to \n\n【10】straighten the affected finger, a painful click is elicited when the finger is fully extended.\n\n【11】Figure 48.1 \n\n【12】Questions:\n\n【13】• What is the diagnosis?\n\n【14】• How would you manage this condition?132\n\n【15】100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology\n\n【16】ANSWER 48\n\n【17】The diagnosis is ‘trigger finger’, a name chosen because typically the finger suddenly \n\n【18】extends fully with a snap. It results from thickening of the flexor tendon within the distal \n\n【19】aspect of the palm. The gliding of the flexor tendon within the tendon sheath is affected. \n\n【20】This results in abrupt flexion of the finger. There is often tenderness over the A1 pulley \n\n【21】(a fibrous structure located at the MCP joint through which the flexor tendon passes) and \n\n【22】intermittent restriction to flexion and extension of the finger. A nodule may develop on \n\n【23】the tendon causing the tendon to get stuck in the pulley when attempting to extend the \n\n【24】digit. Trigger digits are most commonly seen in adults aged between 50 and 60 years, and \n\n【25】less commonly can be seen in congenital cases affecting the thumb in children.\n\n【26】In the majority of cases a steroid infiltration into the affected tendon sheath can give \n\n【27】symptomatic relief. Splinting of the finger can help in reducing inflammation. Digits that \n\n【28】fail to respond to two or three injections may benefit from surgery. Surgical release of the \n\n【29】A1 flexor pulley will allow the inflamed tendon to pass through and relieve symptoms. \n\n【30】Congenital cases do not respond to injections and require surgical intervention.\n\n【31】KEY POINTS\n\n【32】• Gliding of the flexor tendon within the tendon sheath is affected in trigger finger.\n\n【33】• Often there is tenderness over the A1 pulley.

Larger studies with long-term follow-up are required to confirm this.

Bronchiectasis usually affects the lower lobe.\n\n【56】**What is the difference between standard and high-resolution CT?**\n\n【57】In standard CT， the resolution is 10 mm thick whereas with high-resolution CT the slices are 1-1.5 mm thick and high spatial resolution algorithms are used to reconstruct images (Radiology 1994；193：369-74).\n\n【58】**What do you know about spiral CT?**\n\n【59】This is a rapidly evolving technique to image the chest and has the advan-t10110一门age of creating truly contiguous sections； consequentl11TA7 s7ix+11-1yasy1 totally seamlessreconstructions are possible.

She has an end￾expiratory wheeze throughout all lung fields and coarse crackles at the right lung base. \n\n【7】On presentation her oxygen saturations were 84 per cent on room air, but after being \n\n【8】given 2 L/min oxygen via a Hudson mask the saturations increased to 96 per cent. \n\n【9】Arterial blood gas results are shown below.\n\n【10】INVESTIGATIONS\n\n【11】 Room air 2 L/min O2 Normal range\n\n【12】pH 7.42 7.31 7.35–7.45\n\n【13】PO2 7.0 9.0 9.3–13.3 kPa\n\n【14】PCO2 6.6 8.0 4.7–6.0 kPa\n\n【15】Lactate 1.0 2.1 <2 mmol/L\n\n【16】HCO3 24 26 22–26 mmol/L\n\n【17】Base excess +1 +3 -3 to +3 mmol/L\n\n【18】Saturation 84% 96% >94%\n\n【19】Questions\n\n【20】• This patient is having an infective exacerbation of COPD. How will you treat her \n\n【21】initially?\n\n【22】• Interpret the blood gas results and suggest treatment options.222\n\n【23】ANSWER 83\n\n【24】The patient will need broad-spectrum antibiotics; whether they are given orally or intra￾venously will depend on the patient’s clinical status and her blood results. In this case, \n\n【25】the patient is unwell and will probably need intravenous antibiotics for at least 24 hours. \n\n【26】A sputum sample should be taken and sent for microscopy, culture and sensitivity so \n\n【27】that targeted antibiotic therapy can later be given. If possible, try to find out whether \n\n【28】the patient has previously grown any specific bacteria in her sputum as this may guide \n\n【29】antibiotic choice.\n\n【30】Prescribe bronchodilating nebulizers, starting with salbutamol, a B2 agonist, which will \n\n【31】help to open up the airways. Nebulized ipratropium bromide, an anticholinergic, should \n\n【32】also be given to block the smooth muscle acetylcholine receptors in the bronchi.\n\n【33】A course of steroids should be commenced, usually oral prednisolone for 7–10 days. This \n\n【34】will dampen down the inflammatory response in the airways.\n\n【35】She will need an oxygen prescription chart, stating her target saturations, to inform the \n\n【36】ward staff of how much oxygen to give her at any point in time and when to call for a \n\n【37】doctor to review her oxygen requirements.\n\n【38】An arterial blood gas sample should always be performed on room air, to assess for \n\n【39】hypoxia and hypercapnia. In this case, the patient had a blood gas on admission and a \n\n【40】repeat test after oxygen was administered. The arterial blood gas may need to be repeated \n\n【41】if a different concentration of oxygen is given or if her clinical condition changes.\n\n【42】If the patient’s condition fails to improve, other drugs (e.g. the bronchodilator aminophyl￾line) may be needed. If this is the case, the high-dependency unit should be notified, as \n\n【43】she may need to be transferred to a ward with a higher level of care.\n\n【44】The first blood gas shows that the patient is hypoxic with a low PO2. The second blood \n\n【45】gas shows that, although her oxygen saturations and PO2 have picked up with 2 L/min \n\n【46】oxygen, her PCO2 has increased and she now has a metabolic acidosis. She has a low PO2\n\n【47】and a high PCO2 – this is type 2 respiratory failure.\n\n【48】Due to chronic impaired gas exchange, this woman probably always has a high baseline \n\n【49】PCO2, which means that her hypercapnic drive has been blunted over time. In this situa￾tion, by improving her Po2 levels, you will reverse her hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstric￾tion that leads to ineffective CO2 excretion. Coupled with the Haldane effect, this would \n\n【50】result in the further elevation of pCO2 and thence CO2 narcosis.\n\n【51】The patient will probably need non-invasive ventilation (NIV) to provide oxygen and help \n\n【52】reduce her hypercapnia. She should be transferred to a high-dependency unit or a ward \n\n【53】that manages NIV. She will need frequent arterial blood gas measurements to titrate the \n\n【54】settings of the NIV.\n\n【55】The patient should have a ‘respiratory passport’ produced when she has improved, docu￾menting her baseline arterial blood gas results and stating that she is prone to type 2 \n\n【56】respiratory failure when given oxygen. Aim for the patient to have oxygen saturations \n\n【57】of 88–92 per cent rather than >94 per cent as she can probably tolerate lower oxygen \n\n【58】saturations. She should be reviewed by a COPD nurse for future management.223\n\n【59】KEY POINTS\n\n【60】• Patients with infective exacerbations of COPD should be managed with antibiotics \n\n【61】and oxygen as required. As some patients with COPD are prone to type 2 respiratory \n\n【62】failure, arterial blood gas samples should be taken if oxygen is given to monitor for \n\n【63】carbon dioxide retention.\n\n【64】• Once the patient has recovered from an exacerbation, he/she should be introduced to \n\n【65】a COPD nurse specialist and an individual respiratory passport should be constructed, \n\n【66】in the community if possible.This page intentionally left blank 225\n\n【67】", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The parents are both healthy； they have had an affected male and an affected female child. These facts lead to the conclusion that the leuko-cyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. In fact， the gene encoding CD18 has been mapped to the long arm of chromosome 2l at position 21q22.\n\n【12】**Answer 2**\n\n【13】Monoclonal antibodies against CD18 can induce a mild phenotype of LAD. Such monoclonal antibodies have been used to prevent graft rejection in recipients of kid-ney grafts and， when administered before bone marrow transplantation， can prevent graft-versus-host disease.\n\n【14】**Answer 3**\n\n【15】**T cells express the Biintegrin VLA-4(Fig. A27.3)， and its interaction with VCAM-1 on endothelia seems to be sufficient to enable T cells to home and function normallv. VLA-4 is not expressed on neutrophils and macrophages， which are much more dependent on β2 integrins for their adhesion to other cells. B cells also home nor-mally in LAD， and this is probably due to the integrin 04：B7， which is not defective in this disease.**\n\n【16】**Answer 4**\n\n【17】Luisa's brother had delayed separation of the umbilical cord， and Luisa developed an infection at the site ofumbilical cord separation. The role of neutrophils and mac-rophages in wound healing is not well understood. Nevertheless， it is apparent from cases of LAD that the movement of white blood cells into wounds is vital to normal tissue repair.\n\n【18】**Answer 5**\n\n【19】Fucose is a defining determinant of the sialyl-Lewis\\* element， which is the ligand whereby white blood cells bind to selectins on endothelial cells (see Fig. 27.1). In patients with LAD type 2， impaired transport of fucose into the Golgi apparatus prevents the fucosylation of newly synthesized glycoproteins， such as sialyl-Lewis. Infants with LAD type 2 have very high white blood cell counts because theirleuko-cytes cannot roll on the endothelium to begin the process of leukocyte emigration from the bloodstream.\n\n【20】Answer 6After the transplant， her leukocytes were found to express CD18.\n\n【21】**Answer 7**\n\n【22】This was done to destroy her abnormal cells and create 'space for the transplanted cells. Such preparation can be avoided in the case of severe combined immunode-ficiency because the lymphoid compartment is already devoid of T cells and thus space is available for the transplanted cells without any treatment.\n\n【23】**Answer 8**\n\n【24】PHA is a so-called nonspecific T-cell mitogen. The mitogenic response requires cell-cell interactions that depend on the interaction of LFA-1 with ICAM-1， as well as that of VLA-4 with VCAM-1. In LAD， one of these interactions is missing.\n\n【25】**Answer 9**\n\n【26】In LAD， there is a defect in the mobility of the leukocytes so that their emigration from the circulation to sites of infection is impeded， whereas in chronic granuloma-tous disease (CGD)， the microbicidal capacity of phagocytes (neutrophils and mac-rophages) is impaired. The microbicidal capacity of phagocytes in LAD is normal. Children with LAD therefore never develop the inflammatory lesions characteristic of CGD， which are caused by activated phagocytes. In contrast， the leukocytes in CGD have normal mobility and can reach sites of infection in a normal manner but cannot efficiently destroy the infecting bacteria when they reach them. Hence the development of abscesses and granulomas. Unlike individuals with CGD， children with LAD are no more susceptible to pneumococcal infections than they are to other bacterial infections.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

However, the patient had previously made a living will stipulating that all measures should be undertaken to maintain his life. The patient’s son believes his father’s living will reflects his wishes and wants extreme measures taken to maintain his life.

The appointed durable power of attorney is truly durable and therefore supersedes even a living will. The patient, in good state of mind, believed that the friend would make decisions with which he would agree. It is always appropriate to facilitate a discussion between people involved in making end-of-life decisions, but it is unethical to try to sway the friend by making the choice for him or telling him to listen to the patient’s son or the living will.  \n  \nAnswer A is incorrect . The durable power of attorney should always make decisions consistent with what he believes the patient would want. The physician should not advise the friend to comply with the son’s wishes, but rather remind them both as to the responsibilities of the durable power of attorney.  \n  \nAnswer B is incorrect . Only the patient can change his/her power of attorney. If the patient is non-communicative, the power of attorney cannot be transferred. Many states acknowledge next of kin as durable power of attorney, unless it has been otherwise specifically assigned, as in this case.  \n  \nAnswer C is incorrect . The durable power of attorney is the ultimate decision maker and their decision to withdraw life support will be upheld despite the existence of a living will.  \n  \nAnswer D is incorrect . The durable power of attorney was appointed as such to make decisions in accordance with the patient’s wishes.

However， this child also has anaemia with low MCV， MCH， and MCHC. All these are suggestive of iron deficiency anaemia. The reticulocyte count is low， also supporting the diagnosis.\n\n【32】The history is not consistent with leukaemia， and the platelet count is normal.Haemoglobinopathies can show similar blood results， but are rare in Caucasians， and the serum ferritin can be high (rather than near the lower end of the range as in this child). Anaemia secondary to infection is usually a normocytic， normochromic anaemia. There is no history of blood loss in this child， and the platelet count is normal (a high platelet count， when present， may indicate ongoing occult blood loss).\n\n【33】Serum ferritin is a non-specific inflammatory marker， and can be elevated in the presence of any systemic infection， including viral illnesses. So the near normal serum ferritin value in this child does not preclude the diagnosis of iron deficiency.\n\n【34】The most common cause of a microcytic， hypochromic anaemia is iron deficiency， generally secondary to the poor dietary intake of iron (Box 5.1). However， malabsorption (as in coeliac disease) can present similarly； hence， it would be advisable to arrange a blood test for a coeliac screen for this child.

In the Kiron deficiency is more common in those children consuming over 1 litre of cow’s milk daily and in _一_ mose in whom unmodified cow’s milk was introduced before 8 months of age (2). Cow's milk is low in on， but the existing evidence suggests that other causes， including weaning foods， when not adequate miron content， are at least as important in causing iron deficiency. Deficiency of iron manifests initially as a fall in serum ferritin， and later on as a reduction in the haemoglobin concentration of the blood.**\n\n【45】**Host affected infants are asymptomatic. However， the deficiency can be associated with many systemic aonormalities： blue sclerae， koilonychia，impaired exercise capacity， and an increased susceptibility to mfection.

GnRH produced in the hypothalamus stimulates the pituitary hormones FSH and LH, which induce the maturation of follicles and release of ova from the ovaries. Estrogen and progesterone produced in the ovaries create a feedback loop on the hypothalamus and pituitary. Clomiphene is a competitive antagonist of the estrogen receptor. It is used for the treatment of infertility in women who have anovulatory menstrual cycles. By antagonizing estrogen receptors in the pituitary gland, clomiphene disrupts the normal negative feedback on the release of FSH. The elevated levels of FSH then help to induce the development of follicles in the ovaries. Potential risks of the use of clomiphene include the stimulation of multiple follicles and release of multiple eggs, with a resultant multiple gestations. It may also cause ovarian enlargement.

Antagonists acting within the system also have uses in treating hormone-dependent cancers and as abortifacients. The menstrual cycle is controlled by a complex feedback system between the hypothalamus, pituitary, and ovaries (see Case 39 ). LH and FSH are released from the pituitary on stimulation by GnRH released from the hypothalamus. GnRH is released from the hypothalamus in a pulsatile manner under the control of the “pulse generator” in neurons in the arcuate nucleus. In the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle, the pulse generator causes release of GnRH at a rate of approximately one pulse per hour, and consequently release of LH and FSH from the pituitary is also pulsatile. The intermittent release of GnRH is a key to controlling the menstrual cycle because continuous infusion of GnRH results in cessation of release of the pituitary gonadotropins, estrogen, and progesterone, and produces amenorrhea. FSH acts on the graafian follicle to cause maturation of ova and the secretion of estrogen. As estrogen levels rise, LH and FSH production is inhibited because of negative feedback that diminishes the _amplitude_ of the GnRH pulse; release of FSH is also diminished by inhibin that is released by the ovary. At midcycle, alterations in the responsiveness of the pituitary to gonadotropins occur, and the negative feedback pattern is replaced by a period of positive feedback when estradiol causes an increase in the release of LH and FSH. This change in pituitary responsiveness requires levels of serum estradiol above 150 pg/mL for 36 hours. The positive feedback elicits the midcycle surge of LH and FSH that causes ovulation. After ovulation, the corpus luteum is able to secrete progesterone for its lifetime of 14 days if pregnancy does not occur. Progesterone decreases the frequency of the hypothalamic pulse-generator and inhibits LH and FSH release from the pituitary. A frequent cause of infertility is a disruption in the complex feedback regulatory patterns that results in anovulation.\n\n【26】The ovary produces a number of estrogens; the most important are 17β-estradiol and estrone. 17β-Estradiol and estrone are classical steroid hormones containing a four-ring structure and 18 carbon atoms. Progesterone is also a classical steroid composed of 21 carbon atoms.\n\n【27】The effects of estrogen and progesterone are mediated by hormone-specific nuclear receptors. There are two types of estrogen receptors, termed ER <sub>α </sub> and ER <sub>β </sub> . Most tissues express more ER <sub>α </sub> , but the relative amount of the two receptors is tissue and cell dependent. The precise role that each of these receptors plays in mediating the various effects of the estrogens is unclear. 17β-Estradiol has the highest affinity for the ERs; estrone binds to both receptors with a lower affinity than estradiol. ER <sub>α </sub> and ERβ are nuclear receptors that reside within the nucleus bound to the promoters of target genes at estrogen response elements even in the absence of ligand. On binding an estrogen, a conformational change occurs in the receptor such that additional proteins are recruited to the receptor. These proteins, called coactivators, are able to increase the transcription rate of estrogen-dependent target genes. There are also two forms of the progesterone receptor called PRA and PRB. These two isoforms are derived from a single gene by differential use of two promoters within the progesterone receptor gene. Human PRB contains an additional 164 amino acids on the amino terminus of the mature protein; the rest of the PRB is identical to PRA. Both receptors reside within the nucleus bound to PREs and activate gene expression in a fashion similar to ERs, but the target genes are different as a result of differences in the sequence of ERE compared to PRE. In most circumstances, PRA inhibits the action of PRB (and of some other nuclear receptors such as ER <sub>α </sub> and ER <sub>β </sub> as well). Thus, the amplitude of the effects elicited by progesterone depends on the ratio of the two isoforms.\n\n【28】Estrogens and progesterone have a variety of pharmacologic uses including oral contraception, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in postmenopausal women, treatment of osteoporosis, and for failure of ovarian development.\n\n【29】Oral Contraceptives Oral combination contraceptives contain synthetic estrogens, most commonly ethinyl estradiol, and a progestin (for example, norethin-drone or norgestrel). Over the past several years the doses of estrogen in combination oral contraceptives have diminished, and the ratio of estrogen to progestin has evolved from a fixed ratio (monophasic) to biphasic and triphasic regimens with varying ratios that attempt to more closely mimic the ratio during the normal menstrual cycle. The primary mechanism of action of oral contraceptives is prevention of ovulation. The midcycle LH surge is absent, and endogenous estrogen levels are reduced. Oral contraceptives also alter transport of the ovum down the fallopian tube; increase the viscosity of mucus produced by the cervix, which impairs sperm entry; and create an endometrial environment less favorable to implantation. Several preparations are available for continuous dosing for 84 or 365 days; this reduces the number of bleeding periods per year.\n\n【30】Progestin-only contraceptives may be administered as a daily oral dose, a depot injection (medroxyprogesterone acetate), or as a progestin ( L \\-norgestrel) implant. Their effectiveness approaches combination oral contraceptives, and both the depot injection and the implants have the advantage of a long duration of action (14 weeks for the injection, 5 years for the implants). Progestins alone inhibit ovulation approximately 70 percent of the time, but their effectiveness is increased by effects on the endometrium and cervical mucus production.\n\n【31】Several emergency (“morning-after”) contraceptive regimens have been used effectively to prevent pregnancy if used within 72 hours of coitus. The most common regimen consists of 2 combination oral contraceptive pills containing 50 mcg of ethinyl estradiol and 500 mcg of norgestrel or levonorgestrel immediately and 2 at 12 hours. Alternative (Plan B) schedule includes 2 doses of 750 mcg of L \\-norgestrel over 1 day; Plan B One Step is one 1.5 mg dose of L \\-norgestrel.\n\n【32】Hormone Replacement Therapy The decline in the production of estrogens that occurs at and following menopause is associated with increased rates of bone loss that can result in frank osteoporosis, vasomotor symptoms such as hot flashes and night sweats, vaginal dryness and thinning, and genital atrophy. All of these symptoms can be alleviated by estrogens, but careful assessment of the risk-benefit ratio for a given patient is essential. The most commonly prescribed oral estrogen preparation for postmenopausal therapy is a complex mixture of natural estrogens (conjugated equine estrogen, Premarin), by mass mostly estrone sulphate and equilin estrogens, and this is usually combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate to avoid unopposed estrogenic stimulation of the endometrium. Other HRT or estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) regimens include oral esterified estrogens, micronized estradiol, and transdermal delivery of estradiol.\n\n【33】Other Uses of Estrogens and Progestins Estrogens can be used to treat circumstances of inadequate hormone production as in primary hypogonadism. This treatment is usually begun early (ages 11–13) to facilitate the development of the secondary sexual organs and to stimulate maximal growth.\n\n【34】Estrogens are also useful in the treatment of intractable dysmenorrhea where inhibition of ovulation may be of therapeutic value. Relatively high doses of estrogens have been used to suppress ovarian production of androgens. Both of these therapeutic approaches depend on estrogen-mediated negative feedback inhibition of gonadotropin release.\n\n【35】Estrogen/progesterone combinations as in oral contraceptives can also be used to reduce acne, to regulate menstrual cycles, to diminish menstrual flow, and for preventing or improving menstrual migraines. IV estrogen is also used in gynecology for symptomatic menorrhagia in the acute setting.\n\n【36】Adverse Effects of Estrogens and Progestins Most of the adverse effects associated with estrogens and progestins are extensions of their physiologic actions. Uterine bleeding is the most common adverse effect associated with use of estradiol. The increased risk of cancer caused by estrogen and progesterone use remains a significant concern. Unopposed estrogen treatment has been well documented to cause an approximate threefold increase in the risk of endometrial cancer. Addition of a progestin to a treatment regimen essentially eliminates this increased risk. Several very large clinical trials examining use of estrogens to treat postmenopausal women have indicated that there is an increased risk of breast cancer with estrogen plus progesterone treatment, and further studies suggest that it is the progestin that is likely responsible for this effect. The absolute number of breast cancers that might be attributable to the HRT was very low and appears to be confined to the 60- to 69-year-old cohort. These studies do also show that estrogens _decrease_ the risk of endometrial, ovarian, and colon cancer. The net effect of estrogens and progestins on cancer remains unresolved.\n\n【37】Despite their action to improve serum lipid levels (decreasing low-density lipoprotein \\[LDL\\] cholesterol and increasing high-density lipoprotein \\[HDL\\] cholesterol), and despite a history of anecdotal evidence, data are accumulating that the most common HRT (Premarin or Prempro) does not reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in older (60–69 years old) people. The interpretation of these data has been vigorously debated, but it now appears that HRT may be protective in women in the 50- to 59-year-old cohort who did not experience a long, estrogen-free period. Estrogens do increase the risk of stroke; the underlying mechanism for this increased risk is unclear, but may involve the increased coagulability that is associated with estrogen treatment. Estrogens increase the synthesis of fibrin and coagulation factors II, VII, VIII, IX, and X, and decrease the concentration of antithrombin III. In addition, plasminogen activator inhibitor activity is increased. These changes all contribute to a heightened tendency to form blood clots. This mechanism may also participate in the increased risk of dementia in postmenopausal women treated with estrogens. It must be noted that these serious adverse effects have been documented only with Premarin or Premarin plus progesterone at a fixed dosage, and it is not certain if other dosing regimens or other estrogen preparations cause similar untoward effects. Less serious adverse effects of estrogens include nausea and vomiting and peripheral edema. Some women complain of severe migraine when taking estrogens.\n\n【38】", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The man also has multiple firm subcutaneous nodules on his hands.  |\n| --- |\n| What is the most likely diagnosis?Asbestosis.  |\n| What other conditions should be considered in the differential diagnosis?Interstitial lung diseases should also be considered， especially those caused by occupational exposure：·Silicosis is caused by exposure to silica dust and characterized by fever， cough， shortness of breath，andcyanosis. X-ray of the chest will usually show multiple small nodules located primarily in the upper lungzones. ·Coal worker's pneumoconiosis is due to inhaled coal dust that accumulates in the lungs and， over time，causes inflammation and fibrosis. Symptoms are usually mild at first and include chronic cough andshortness of breath. X-ray of the chest often shows large masses of dense fibrosis in the upper lung zones. ·BBerylliosis is classically associated with beryllium mining or exposure to fluorescent light bulbs. Patientsdevelop small inflammatory nodules in their lungs (ie， granulomas) that ultimately progress to restrictivelung disease. Conditions not related to occupational exposure， including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis， should also beconsidered.  |\n| What is the pathophysiology of this condition? The pathophysiologic process of asbestosis involves diffuse pulmonary interstitial fibrosis caused byinhaled asbestos fibers. Asbestos fibers penetrate bronchioles and lung tissue， where they are surroundedby macrophages and coated by a protein-iron complex (ferruginous bodies)； Figure 14-2 shows thesephagocytosed bodies. Diffuse fibrosis around the bronchioles spreads to the alveoli， causing lung tissueto become rigid and airways distorted. FIGURE 14-2. Asbestos bodies.

On careful questioning it will be evident \n\n【155】that discharge comes out only during meals. There may \n\n【156】be excoriation of the neighbourhood skin.\n\n【157】Special Investigations.—•\n\n【158】A sialogram should be performed with watery solution \n\n【159】of lipiodol. This will give an indication whether the fistula \n\n【160】is in relation to the main duct, ductule or to the gland.\n\n【161】Treatment.—\n\n【162】(i) When the fistula is connected with the main \n\n【163】duct — reconstruction of the duct by Newman or \n\n【164】Seabrock's operation should be performed. In this \n\n【165】operation one probe is passed through the parotid duct \n\n【166】opening in the mouth in a rertograde fashion into the \n\n【167】parotid duct upto the fistula. Another probe is introduced \n\n【168】through the external fistula. A horizontal incision is made \n\n【169】on the cheek. The ducts are dissected out and the divided \n\n【170】ends are identified and made free. A tantalum wire is \n\n【171】passed into the distal and proximal ends of the duct. \n\n【172】The severed ends are now sutured with free chromic \n\n【173】catgut over the tantalum wire. The adjacent connective \n\n【174】tissues are approximated with great care so that there is \n\n【175】no chance of recurrence. The skin incision is closed.

FREY’S SYNDROME)\n\n【187】Partial injury to the auriculotemporal nerve gives rise \n\n【188】to such syndrome. This type of injury —\n\n【189】(i) May be congenital, possibly due to birth\n\n【190】trauma.\n\n【191】(ii) May be accidental injury.\n\n【192】(iii) May be caused by inadvertent incision for \n\n【193】drainage of parotid abscess.\n\n【194】(iv) May occasionally follow superficial \n\n【195】parotidectomy.\n\n【196】In this condition (a) there is flushing and sweating \n\n【197】of the skin innervated by the auriculotemporal nerve \n\n【198】particularly during meal and (b) presence of cutaneous \n\n【199】hyperaesthesia in front and above the ear the area supplied \n\n【200】by the auriculotemporal nerve.\n\n【201】The EXPLANATION of this syndrome is —\n\n【202】(i) The postganglionic parasympathetic fibres \n\n【203】become united to the sympathetic nerves from the \n\n【204】superior cervical ganglion which are concerned to supply \n\n【205】vessels and sweat glands of that region. This causes \n\n【206】flushing and sweating of the skin.\n\n【207】(ii) Following injury to the auriculotemporal nerve, \n\n【208】postganglionic parasympathetic fibres from the otic \n\n【209】ganglion grow down the sheaths of the cutaneous \n\n【210】filaments, so hyperaesthesia follows stimulation of the \n\n【211】secretomotor nerves.\n\n【212】EXAMINATIONS.—\n\n【213】If the symptoms persist, the treatment is avulsion of \n\n【214】the auriculotemporal nerve in front of the auricle where \n\n【215】it lies just posterior to the superficial temporal vessels.\n\n【216】SYNDROME\n\n【217】Salivary stones are more common in the \n\n【218】submandibular salivary gland than in the parotid gland \n\n【219】because the saliva of the submandibular salivary gland is\n\n【220】more viscid and saturated in calcium salts. Such stones \n\n【221】develop more frequently within the duct of the \n\n【222】submandibular gland (Wharton's duct). Less commonly \n\n【223】the calculi may occur within the gland substance.\n\n【224】AETIOLOGY.— Pathogenesis of calculus formation \n\n【225】is unknown. It has been suggested —\n\n【226】(i) That chronic inflammation may cause \n\n【227】inspissation of the saliva and deposition of calcium salts.\n\n【228】(ii) That retention of secretion may cause calculi \n\n【229】formation. Such retention is more common in the \n\n【230】submandibular salivary gland as the duct has a very \n\n【231】curved route and the secretion from the superficial lobe \n\n【232】goes up and reach the submandibular duct through the \n\n【233】deep part which is not a dependent drainage.\n\n【234】Composition of the stone.—\n\n【235】A salivary gland calculus is composed of cellular \n\n【236】debris and mucus in the centre, but the main content is \n\n【237】calcium and magnesium phosphate. Such combination is \n\n【238】found in tartar of the tooth.\n\n【239】Clinical features.—\n\n【240】Painful swelling during meals is the most important \n\n【241】symptom. Such pain may be preceded by salivary colic. \n\n【242】When this history is forthcoming, the patient should be \n\n【243】given some lemon juice and the swelling can be produced. \n\n【244】At this time if one examines the orifice of the affected \n\n【245】duct, it shows little or no ejection of saliva.\n\n【246】COMPLICATIONS.—\n\n【247】(i) Age.— Majority of the patients are young to \n\n【248】middle age. This condition is rarely seen in children.\n\n【249】(ii) Sex.— Males and females are almost equally \n\n【250】involved.\n\n【251】PAROTID FISTULA\n\n【252】\n(i) The main complaint is pain and swelling \n\n【253】beneath the jaw just before and during meals. Both the \n\n【254】symptoms last throughout the meal. After certain period \n\n【255】the pain and the swelling gradually subside.\n\n【256】(ii) Some residual pain and swelling beneath the \n\n【257】jaw may be the constant complaint.\n\n【258】(iii) Some discomfort or swelling may be \n\n【259】complained of in the floor of the mouth. Some patients \n\n【260】may give a typical history of colic just before the meals.\n\n【261】(iv) Patient may be able to relieve his symptoms \n\n【262】by pressing on the gland. On the other hand such action \n\n【263】may lead to ejection of foul tasting fluid in the mouth \n\n【264】(purulent saliva).\n\n【265】(v) Patient may give previous history of similar \n\n【266】symptom on the other side of the face.SALIVARY GLANDS 83\n\n【267】TREATMENT.—\n\n【268】Sometimes the submandibular gland may be swollen \n\n【269】when the patient presents to the doctor. If such swelling \n\n【270】is not present, the clinician can produce the condition \n\n【271】artificially by instilling a few drops of lemon juice into \n\n【272】the patient's mouth. This will cause pain and swelling of \n\n【273】the gland. The clinician must look at the opening of the \n\n【274】involved duct and no saliva is seen to be coming out \n\n【275】through that orifice.\n\n【276】Once the swelling is detected, the lump is examined \n\n【277】in the following manner —\n\n【278】(i) Temperature and tenderness.— Usually the gland \n\n【279】is not hot, but if it is infected, it may be hot and the \n\n【280】overlying skin will be red and oedematous. Slight \n\n【281】tenderness may be expected.\n\n【282】(ii) Consistency.— The distended gland feels elastic, \n\n【283】rubbery and firm.\n\n【284】(iii) Bimanual palpation is important. The gland is \n\n【285】felt between the index finger of one hand inside the \n\n【286】mouth and fingers of the other hand on the outer surface \n\n【287】of the lump just below the mandible (See Fig. 25.14 of \n\n【288】'A Manual On Clinical Surgery'). The finger inside the \n\n【289】mouth can feel the deep part of the salivary gland. To \n\n【290】exclude impaction of the stone in the duct, the whole\n\n【291】duct must be palpated bimanually.\n\n【292】The floor Of The Mouth.—\n\n【293】Inspection.— The patient is asked to open his mouth \n\n【294】and lift his tongue to the roof of the mouth. This \n\n【295】displays the floor of the mouth for inspection. By means \n\n【296】of a torch it is inspected carefully. The orifices of the \n\n【297】submandibular (Wharton's) ducts are situated on the \n\n【298】either side of frenulum linguae. It is noted whether the \n\n【299】orifice looks inflamed or swollen due to impaction of a \n\n【300】stone in the duct. A stone may be impacted in the \n\n【301】ampulla just beneath the orifice and can be seen if \n\n【302】inspected carefully. If the salivary gland is infected, slight \n\n【303】pressure on the gland will extrude pus through the \n\n【304】respective orifice. If a stone is impacted in one duct, \n\n【305】saliva will be seen coming out with normal flow from \n\n【306】the other orifice while the orifice concerned remains dry. \n\n【307】This may be tested by two dry swabs one on each orifice \n\n【308】and some lemon juice may be dropped on the dorsum \n\n【309】of the tongue. A minute later the patient is asked to \n\n【310】move the tongue up and two swabs are examined. The \n\n【311】swab on the orifice of the duct where the stone is \n\n【312】impacted will remain dry.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

When we take a _metaperspective_ , we understand that a verbal representation of reality is not the same as reality—“the map is not the territory” and “the menu is not the meal.”\n\n【2】Bandler and Grinder (1990) explain that because we use words to store, file, and retrieve our experiences, there is a natural tendency to delete (eliminate information), generalize (ignore differences), and distort (classify information arbitrarily or erroneously). Furthermore, because we code in words, we can only code those events for which we have words.\n\n【3】There is an inevitable gap between a cognitive map (demonstrated through the use of language) and real-world experiences.\n\n【4】To reduce this gap, therapists need a set of tools for recognizing, exploring, and challenging the information presented by the client. To meet this goal, Bandler and Grinder created a set of linguistic information-gathering tools that they called the _Metamodel._ They defined a set of nine categories of deletion, overgeneralization, and distortion, which together can be called _metamodel violations_ (the word _violation_ means that there is an insufficiency in the verbalized cognitive map). The therapist’s task is to search for specific data about concrete experience, moving the client from the cognitive level to sensory information. For instance, when a client says that she is ending a friendship with her best girlfriend because “she betrayed me,” the therapist does not assume that betrayal took place but instead is curious about the actual experience that the client is labeling _betrayal_ . The therapist wants data of experience, or what is called a _fully specified_ description that contains sensory data about real-world events. Some clients reveal very little concrete information, seeming to be accessing stored language and meaning systems, rather than sensory data. These clients have stored sensory experience (we all do) but need direction to access it—hence the need for Metamodel questions. Through these questions, the therapist gathers data and challenges the client to recognize her own faulty thinking, often leading to new discoveries. The metamodel question, “How specifically did she betray you?” can elicit several types of answers:\n\n【5】1.  Cognitive answer (no sensory data): _She was very disloyal. She showed me that she is completely untrustworthy._ The therapist will need to try again to get the sensory information.\n2.  Sensory-specific answer that _supports_ the interpretation of betrayal: _She told me that she is having an affair with my husband._\n3.  Sensory-specific answer that _does_ _not_ _support_ the interpretation of betrayal: _She had lunch with our mutual friend and didn’t invite me._\n\n【6】Some clients who give an answer of the third type will spontaneously correct their own cognitive map: _I guess I’m wrong to say that she betrayed me. Even though I feel hurt, I know she has the right to see her various friends separately._\n\n【7】As you can see, metamodel questions not only gather data but also have the ability to improve the client’s informational processing skills. For each category of “violation,” there is a specific type of question. Table 2.3 presents the Metamodel with sample questions and answers for each category. You will realize that the client’s words can be classified in more than one category and could be responded to with different questions. Furthermore, the answers could be followed up with additional questions to get more specific sensory-specific data.\n\n【8】Table 2.3 Metamodel Questions\n\n【9】| Deletion: Some details are missing. |\n| --- |\n| Strategy: Use brief information-gathering questions like _where, when, of what, by whom._ |\n| _Example:_ Client’s Words: I am afraid. |\n| Metamodel Question: Of what, specifically? |\n| Sensory-Specific Answer : That he will say something mean to me. |\n| Lack of Referential Index: Vague pronoun, vague plural or abstract noun. |\n| Strategy: Ask for identification of the specific people or things that are being referred to. |\n| _Example:_ Client’s Words: Men can’t be trusted. |\n| Metamodel Question: Which man, specifically, can’t you trust? |\n| Sensory-Specific Answer: I can’t trust Joe; I caught him in several lies. |\n| Unspecified Verb: Vague about the observable actions and behaviors. |\n| Strategy: Ask _how_ to elicit specific actions and behaviors. |\n| _Example_ : Client’s Words: He bullies other kids. |\n| Metamodel Question: How specifically does he bully them? |\n| Sensory-Specific Answer: He threatens to hit them if they don’t give him some of their lunch. |\n| Nominalization: An ongoing process that is turned into a static thing by using an abstract noun. |\n| Strategy: Replace the noun with a verb, and then ask _how_ to specify the verb. |\n| _Example:_ Client’s Words: Our relationship is dull. |\n| Metamodel Question: How specifically are you relating? |\n| Sensory-Specific Answer: We spend the evenings and weekends in separate rooms watching different TVs. |\n| Universal Quantifier: Overgeneralization; all-or-nothing thinking. |\n| Strategy: Exaggerate the word or ask for an exception. In the answer, the client either recognizes it is as an overgeneralization or provides information to prove that it is a valid representation of experience. |\n| _Example:_ Client’s Words: I’m never included. |\n| Metamodel Question: Never? _or_ Have you ever been included? |\n| Sensory-Specific Answer: |\n| _Example 1:_ I can remember two times when they invited me. |\n| _Example 2:_ No, and once when I asked if I could come, they said, “No, we don’t want your company.” |\n| Modal Operator: Imposed limits; shoulds and can’ts. |\n| Strategy: For _can’ts_ —Search for obstacle; for _shoulds_ —Examine imagined consequences of not obeying “should.” |\n| _Example 1:_ Client’s Words: I can’t tell him how I feel. |\n| Metamodel Question: What stops you? |\n| Sensory-Specific Answer: I have a fear of discovering that I care more than he does. |\n| _Example 2:_ Client’s Words: I have to spend every Sunday with my mother. |\n| Metamodel Question: What would happen if you didn’t? |\n| Sensory-Specific Answer: My mother will complain about what a bad son Iam, and I guess I have difficulty tolerating her disapproval. |\n| Mind Reading: Making assumptions about another person’s feelings, thoughts, or intentions. |\n| Strategy: Search for sensory data that support the assumption; this can challenge the client to stop mind reading. |\n| _Example:_ Client’s Words: He wants me to fail. |\n| Metamodel Question: How specifically do you know? |\n| Sensory-Specific Answer: |\n| _Example 1:_ I guess I don’t really know, I never asked him how he feels about it. |\n| _Example 2:_ He told me that he hopes I don’t pass the test. |\n| Cause-Effect Errors: There is a faulty assumption that A causes B or that A prevents B. Common examples are “Another person makes me feel something” or “I would do it but . . .” |\n| Strategy: Challenge the causal link, and search for disconfirming data; you may need to ask several questions to get the client to recognize that there is no proof of causation. |\n| _Example:_ Client’s Words: She makes me feel guilty. |\n| Metamodel Question: How are your guilty feelings caused by her? (Have you ever not felt guilty when she said that? Could you imagine feeling differently?) |\n| Sensory-Specific Answer: I guess I let her get to me. I suppose I could just feel sorry for her. |\n| Lost Performative: Imposed values; an unexamined platitude. |\n| Strategy: Inquire about source of belief. You want the client to challenge the truth of the statement or to take responsibility for choosing it as a personal value or preference. |\n| _Example:_ Client’s Words: Vacations are a waste of money. |\n| Metamodel Question: According to whom? |\n| Sensory-Specific Answer: |\n| _Example 1:_ My parents always said that, but they were very poor, and I have lots of money and can decide to spend it the way I want. |\n| _Example 2:_ According to me. I prefer to spend money on remodeling my home. |\n\n【10】I recommend that students engage in several hours of drill until metamodel skills become automatic. You listen to a sentence and then practice asking the right kind of question, remembering that each sentence probably can be challenged in different ways. An answer invites another question, until the answer is sufficiently concrete and specific or the client recognizes the gap between belief and evidence. You would not bombard a client with question after question, but in a practice drill with classmates or fellow trainees, the goal is to learn the metamodel rather than to develop sensitive counseling skills. The reward for this effort is that you are training your mind to automatically take the metaperspective. At that point, you discover that there are many ways, besides metamodel questions, to move away from cognitive labeling and descriptions to the real experiences:\n\n【11】*   Tell me the whole story of the argument you had, starting from the beginning.\n*   If I were watching you on TV, what would I be seeing?\n*   What is your definition of that word?\n*   Could you give me some examples?\n*   What specific actions and behaviors were you observing?\n\n【12】### Activity 2.1: Metamodel Practice\n\n【13】Study Table 2.3 thoroughly before doing this activity.\n\n【14】Instructions: Here are 10 sentences spoken by different clients. Pay attention to the part that is underlined and decide which metamodel violation it represents ( Table 2.3 lists the names of violations.)\n\n【15】You must use every one of the nine types once, and one of them is used twice.\n\n【16】For each client statement, provide the name of the violation, the appropriate metamodel question, and an answer that uses sensory-specific language.\n\n【17】1.  I shouldn’t talk about my problems to someone outside my family.\n2.  I have a hard time with authority figures .\n3.  I’m feeling very frustrated with our communication .\n4.  I can’t keep my house clean.\n5.  She is always blaming me.\n6.  He makes me watch football games on TV.\n7.  I’m tired of the way he exploits me.\n8.  You don’t appreciate all the work I’ve done.\n9.  I’m worried .\n10.  You’ve always got to try your hardest at everything you do .\n\n【18】The correct names of the violations and sample answers appear in Appendix IV.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

However， relaxation of airway smooth muscle would decrease resistance to airflow.**\n\n【20】\\[7.21 E. Airway smooth muscle has B-adrenergic receptors that when stimu-lated by endogenous catecholamines (mainly epinephrine) causes mus-cle relaxation.

The patient began to have fatigue and fever on January 2nd, 2020. At that time, the body temperature was 37.7°C. After taking levofloxacin and Lian Hua Qing Wen Capsule, his symptoms had not resolved, and he still had an intermittent fever; the state of the disease was still mild. On January 24th, the patient had a cough, chest distress, and low-grade fever in the afternoon, and he presented to Wuhan No. 1 Hospital for diagnosis and treatment. Complete blood count revealed the following: the white blood cell count was 4.68 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> per liter, the absolute value of lymphocyte was 0.46 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> per liter, and the absolute value of neutrophil was 3.61 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> per liter. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed the following: scattered patchy focus of infection in the left lung, fibrous proliferation in the right lung, enlarged lymph node shadow in the mediastinum, coronary artery calcification, and low-density shadow in the liver. The patient received moxifloxacin (oral medicine), but the symptoms of cough and chest distress were gradually aggravated, and the body temperature was about 37.5°C; then, the patient received transfusion treatment (the specific medication was unknown) on February 5th. On February 7th, the patient tested for SARS-CoV-2 at Union Hospital Affiliated with Tongji Medical College of HUST, and the result was positive. On February 8th, the patient’s body temperature gradually declined, but the chest distress, shortness of breath, cough, and tachypnea while moving developed; the patient presented to Wuhan Red Cross Hospital, and he had a body temperature of 36.9°C and oxygen saturation of 83% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He received 0.4 g of moxifloxacin once a day, 0.2 g of arbidol three times a day, and 25 mg of compound methoxyphenamine hydrochloride three times a day; but, the cough, chest distress, and shortness of breath were gradually aggravated. Then, the patient was transferred to our hospital for further diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【11】Since the patient became ill, his energy, appetite, and sleep were not good, with loose stools (soft, unformed stools) and weight loss. The patient had a history of old tuberculosis. The patient’s son was diagnosed with COVID-19 before the onset of the patient’s disease and had been in close contact with him.\n\n【12】### Patient’s Condition on Admission\n\n【13】The patient reported chest distress, shortness of breath, wheezing while moving, low-grade fever at night, dry cough, fatigue, low energy, poor appetite, insomnia, normal urination, loose stools, and edema of lower limbs. The physical examination revealed a body temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 109 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, blood pressure of 141/97 mmHg, and peripheral oxygen saturation of 85% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The tongue color was red, with fissures on the tongue’s surface, the tongue had less coating ( Figure 2-8-1 ), and the pulse was thready, rapid, and weak.\n\n【14】Figure 2-8-1. Tongue manifestation on admission.\n\n【15】### Admission Diagnosis\n\n【16】① COVID-19 (severe type). ② Old tuberculosis.\n\n【17】### Treatment Plan\n\n【18】On February 10th, the patient reported chest distress, shortness of breath, fatigue, wheezing, low-grade fever at night, body temperature between 37.1°C and 37.3°C, edema of lower limbs, and loose stools. The peripheral oxygen saturation was 85% while the patient was breathing ambient air, the white blood cell count was 5.47 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> per liter, the absolute value of lymphocyte was 0.75 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> per liter, the albumin was 29.5 g per liter, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 26 mm per hour, the hypersensitive C-reactive protein was 42.4 mg per liter, and the serum ferritin was greater than 2000 ng per milliliter. Chest CT showed bilateral multiple pulmonary lobe areas of flocculent strip shadow, with uneven density and margin blurred; it showed the ground-glass opacities change, which was considered viral pneumonia, and bilateral pleural adhesions ( Figure 2-8-2 ).\n\n【19】Figure 2-8-2. Chest CT images on February 10th.\n\n【20】_Note_ : Bilateral multiple pulmonary lobe areas of flocculent strip shadow, with uneven density and margin blurred; it showed ground-glass opacities change, and the left side was particularly severe.\n\n【21】### Western Medicine Treatment Strategies\n\n【22】(1) Given that the patient lived in the epidemic area of Wuhan, and his son was diagnosed with COVID-19, the patient’s symptoms (chest distress, shortness of breath, and fever) were the main clinical symptoms of COVID-19, and combined with the auxiliary examination results (nucleic acid detection for SARS-CoV-2 was positive outside the hospital, chest CT showed viral pneumonia changes), the diagnosis of COVID-19 was clear and definite.\n\n【23】(2) Severity evaluation: the patient was defined as a severe case, with an oxygen saturation of 85% while the patient was at resting state, which met the diagnosis criteria of COVID-19 (severe type).\n\n【24】(3) The patient had continuously received antibiotics and antiviral drugs outside the hospital, but the patient’s condition had not been alleviated.\n\n【25】(4) The patient had a history of the disease for more than one month, and he reported wheezing, shortness of breath, low oxygen saturation, low energy, and poor appetite. The patient received 10 g of human immunoglobulin once a day and 10 g of human serum albumin once a day as supportive treatment. We also gave him short-term treatment with glucocorticoids (40 mg of methylprednisolone was administered intravenously once a day, and gradually the amount of medication was reduced and discontinued).\n\n【26】### TCM Treatment Strategies\n\n【27】#### _02/10/2020_\n\n【28】The patient reported chest distress, shortness of breath, dry cough, fatigue, wheezing and palpitation while moving, poor appetite, insomnia, normal urination, loose stools, edema of lower limbs, and obvious weight loss. And, the tongue color was red, with fissures on the tongue’s surface, there was less coating on the tongue, and the pulse was thready, rapid, and weak. Given the Qi and Yin deficiency of the heart and lungs, inward invasion and upward attacks of dampness turbidity and plague toxin, we used Sheng Mai San to replenish Qi, nourish Yin, and strengthen healthy Qi; the prescription involved Dang Shen ( _Codonopsis Radix_ ), Mai Dong ( _Ophiopogonis Radix_ ), and Wu Wei Zi ( _Schisandrae Chinensis Fructus_ ), one to tonify, the other one to moisten, and the last one as an astringent; finally, Qi and Yin can recover. Besides, we used Ji Ming San to move Qi and descend the turbidity, disperse and resolve cold-dampness; Zi Su Ye ( _Perillae Folium_ ) and Sheng Jiang ( _Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens_ ) can dissipate cold with pungent-warm (a therapeutic method of dissipating external cold evil by using pungent and warm-natured herbs), resolve dampness, and harmonize the spleen and stomach; Jie Geng ( _Platycodonis Radix_ ) can diffuse the lungs to resolve phlegm and diffuse Upper Jiao; Wu Zhu Yu ( _Euodiae Fructus_ ) and Mu Gua ( _Chaenomelis Fructus_ ) can dissipate cold and resolve dampness, free the collateral vessels (a therapeutic method used to relieve obstruction of collateral vessels), and get rid of stagnation; Bin Lang ( _Arecae Semen_ ) can depress Qi and induce diuresis, give way to dampness turbidity and plague toxin; Fu Ling Gan Cao Tang as a supplement can warm yang for diuresis. The formula was as follows:\n\n【29】Dang Shen ( _Codonopsis Radix_ ) 30 g, Mai Dong ( _Ophiopogonis Radix_ ) 15 g, Wu Wei Zi ( _Schisandrae Chinensis Fructus_ ) 6 g, Zi Su Ye ( _Perillae Folium_ ) 10 g, Wu Zhu Yu ( _Euodiae Fructus_ ) 2 g, Jie Geng ( _Platycodonis Radix_ ) 6 g, Sheng Jiang ( _Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens_ ) 10 g, Mu Gua ( _Chaenomelis Fructus_ )10 g, Bin Lang ( _Arecae Semen_ ) 6 g, Fu Ling ( _Poria_ ) 30 g, Gui Zhi ( _Cinnamomi Ramulus_ ) 10 g, Zhi Gan Cao ( _Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma Praeparata Cum Melle_ ) 6 g.\n\n【30】It was given in 3 doses, granules, 1 dose per day, to be taken in the morning and evening.\n\n【31】At the same time, the patient received 50 milliliters of Xue Bi Jing injection at a frequency of once a day for activating blood, resolving stasis, and removing toxicity.\n\n【32】#### _02/12/2020_\n\n【33】The patient complained of aversion to cold and low-grade fever at night, with the maximum body temperature of 37.1°C to 37.3°C. He felt relief automatically in the morning, as chest distress and shortness of breath were alleviated compared to before, with a bitter taste in the mouth in the morning, dry cough, fatigue, wheezing and palpitation while moving, poor appetite, occasional nausea, insomnia, normal urination, loose stools, and edema of lower limbs. And, the peripheral oxygen saturation was 90% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The tongue color was normal with fissures on its surface, the tongue coating was white and thin ( Figure 2-8-3 ), and the pulse was thready and sunken.\n\n【34】Figure 2-8-3. Tongue manifestation on February 12th.\n\n【35】The patient had aversion to cold and low-grade fever at night, low energy, and thready and sunken pulse, which was considered to be Shao Yin fever. The 301st item of _Shang Han Lun_ ( _Treatise on Cold Pathogenic Diseases_ ) recorded that “When Shao Yin disease has just started, but there is fever and the pulse is sunken, Ma Huang Fu Zi Xi Xin Tang governs.” In prescription, Ma Huang ( _Ephedrae Herba_ ) has the effect of dissipating cold with pungent-warm and can open the Tai Yang; Fu Zi ( _Aconiti Lateralis Radix Praeparaia_ ) has the effect of strengthening Yang Qi with pungent-heat and can help to warm the Shao Yin; Xi Xin ( _Asari Radix et Rhizoma_ ) has the effect of migrating with pungent-heat, can cut through exterior and interior, and it can not only help Ma Huang ( _Ephedrae Herba_ ) to open the Tai Yang but also helps Fu Zi ( _Aconiti Lateralis Radix Praeparaia_ ) to warm Yang; the whole prescription can invigorate the Yang Qi and eliminate evil Qi out. The patient had a bitter taste in the morning, poor appetite, and fever sometimes. Given that these were the characteristics of Shao Yang disease, the 96th item of _Shang Han Lun (Treatise on Cold Pathogenic Diseases_ ) recorded that “When Tai Yang disease with cold damage, or Tai Yang disease with wind affection has lasted for five or six days, there are symptoms of alternating aversion to cold and fever, fullness and discomfort in chest and hypochondrium, no desire for food or drink, perturbed and vomiting…Xiao Chai Hu Tang governs.” In prescription, Chai Hu ( _Bupleuri Radix_ ) and Huang Qin ( _Scutellariae Radix_ ) were used to harmonize and release the Shao Yang and, harmonize the pivot; Dang Shen ( _Codonopsis Radix_ ), Sheng Jiang ( _Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens_ ), Da Zao ( _Jujubae Fructus_ ), and Zhi Gan Cao ( _Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma Praeparata Cum Melle_ ) were used to tonify Tai Yin, protect the stomach Qi, store body fluid, and prevent the pro-herb from injuring Yin. Therefore, both prescriptions were combined, Ban Xia ( _Pinelliae Rhizoma_ ) was removed, and Fu Ling ( _Poria_ ) was added to fortify the spleen and drain dampness. The formula was as follows:\n\n【36】Chai Hu ( _Bupleuri Radix_ ) 12 g, Huang Qin ( _Scutellariae Radix_ ) 9 g, Dang Shen ( _Codonopsis Radix_ ) 10 g, Sheng Jiang ( _Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens_ ) 10 g, Da Zao ( _Jujubae Fructus_ )10 g, Ma Huang ( _Ephedrae Herba_ ) 6 g, Xi Xin ( _Asari Radix et Rhizoma_ ) 3 g, Fu Zi ( _Aconiti Lateralis Radix Praeparaia_ ) 9 g, Zhi Gan Cao ( _Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma Praeparata Cum Melle_ ) 6 g, Fu Ling ( _Poria_ ) 30 g.\n\n【37】It was given in 3 doses, granules, 1 dose per day, to be taken in the morning and evening.\n\n【38】#### _02/15/2020_\n\n【39】The symptoms of the patient significantly improved, aversion to cold was completely alleviated, he no longer had a fever, chest distress and shortness of breath were significantly improved, and the energy and appetite were better than before, but he still had a bitter taste in the mouth, and the pulse was sunken and string-like. The peripheral oxygen saturation was 95% while the patient was breathing ambient air, the absolute value of lymphocyte was 1.33 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> per liter, the white blood cell count was 8.50 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> per liter, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 5 mm per hour, the C-reactive protein was 3.4 mg per liter, the serum ferritin was 749.72 ng per milliliter, and the interleukin-6 was 17.51 pg per milliliter. The tongue color was dark and the tongue’s coating was thin, white, and greasy, with slight yellowness ( Figure 2-8-4 ). The pulse was sunken and string-like. The result of chest CT reexamination is shown in Figure 2-8-5 .\n\n【40】The patient’s aversion to cold and fever was resolved, the shortness of breath had improved significantly, but he still had a bitter taste in the mouth, chest distress, dark tongue with a thin white greasy, slightly yellow coating, and sunken and string-like pulse. Considering that the pulse was stronger than before, and chest distress and bitter taste in the mouth were not alleviated, we used Xiao Chai Hu Tang to harmonize and release the Shao Yang and used Gua Lou Xie Bai Ban Xia Tang to soothe the chest and resolve phlegm; besides, Si Wu Tang without Shu Di Huang ( _Rehmanniae Radix Praeparata_ ), and Dan Shen ( _Salviae miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma_ ) were used to increase the power of nourishing the blood and activating the blood. The formula was as follows:\n\n【41】Figure 2-8-4. Tongue manifestation on February 15th.\n\n【42】Figure 2-8-5. Chest CT images on February 14th.\n\n【43】_Note_ : Bilateral pulmonary lobe areas of flocculent strip shadow and ground-glass opacities were absorbed as compared to the previous time.\n\n【44】Chai Hu ( _Bupleuri Radix_ ) 15 g, Huang Qin ( _Scutellariae Radix_ ) 10 g, Ban Xia ( _Pinelliae Rhizoma_ ) 10 g, Dang Shen ( _Codonopsis Radix_ ) 12 g, Gua Lou ( _Trichosanthis Fructus_ ) 20 g, Xie Bai ( _Allii Macrostemonis Bulbus_ ) 10 g, Zhi Shi ( _Aurantii Fructus Immaturus_ ) 10 g, Dan Shen ( _Salviae miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma_ ) 20 g, Chi Shao ( _Paeoniae Radix Rubra_ ) 15 g, Zi Su Zi ( _Perillae Fructus_ ) 15 g, Chuan Xiong ( _Chuanxiong Rhizoma_ ) 12 g, Dang Gui ( _Angelicae Sinensis Radix_ ) 12 g.\n\n【45】It was given in 3 doses, granules, 1 dose per day, to be taken in the morning and evening.\n\n【46】#### _02/18/2020_\n\n【47】The patient had a clear mind, low energy, he reported improved shortness of breath (aggravated after moving), improved chest distress, he did not cough, sputum was not easy to cough, both feet were still swollen and numb, the bitter taste in the mouth was relieved, and the diet was fine. The tongue color was normal with a thin yellow greasy coating ( Figure 2-8-6 ). The body temperature was 36.6°C and peripheral oxygen saturation was 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. A small dose of Ma Huang Fu Zi Xi Xin Tang, and Xiao Chai Hu Tang without Ban Xia ( _Pinelliae Rhizoma_ ) were used. The formula was as follows:\n\n【48】Ma Huang ( _Ephedrae Herba_ ) 5 g, Xi Xin ( _Asari Radix et Rhizoma_ ) 3 g, Fu Zi ( _Aconiti Lateralis Radix Praeparaia_ ) 6 g, Chai Hu ( _Bupleuri Radix_ ) 12 g, Huang Qin ( _Scutellariae Radix_ ) 9 g, Dang Shen ( _Codonopsis Radix_ ) 10 g, Sheng Jiang ( _Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens_ ) 10 g, Zhi Gan Cao ( _Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma Praeparata Cum Melle_ ) 6 g, Da Zao ( _Jujubae Fructus_ ) 10 g, Fu Ling ( _Poria_ ) 30 g.\n\n【49】Figure 2-8-6. Tongue manifestation on February 18th.\n\n【50】It was given in 5 doses, granules, 1 dose per day, to be taken in the morning and evening.\n\n【51】#### _02/21/2020_\n\n【52】On the 12th day of admission, in other words, on the 50th day after the onset of disease, the 9th day of normothermia, the patient’s shortness of breath after moving improved, he sometimes had a headache and chest distress, the cough was not obvious, the numbness of both feet was alleviated, the edema of both feet and bitter taste in the mouth persisted, and the diet was acceptable. The tongue color was normal, with a thin yellow greasy coating ( Figure 2-8-7 ), and the pulse was sunken. The peripheral oxygen saturation was 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Laboratory results on February 19th were as follows: the absolute value of lymphocyte was 1.35 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> per liter, the serum ferritin was 630.94 ng per milliliter, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 5 mm per hour, and the hypersensitive C-reactive protein was 1.4 mg per liter. The result of chest CT re-examination is shown in Figure 2-8-8 . The patient’s feet were swollen; the sunken pulse governs water, so we chose Zhen Wu Tang, which increased the efficacy of warming yang for diuresis. The formula was as follows:\n\n【53】Figure 2-8-7. Tongue manifestation on February 21st.\n\n【54】Figure 2-8-8. Chest CT images on February 20th.\n\n【55】_Note_ : Bilateral pulmonary lesions were significantly absorbed compared to before.\n\n【56】Ma Huang ( _Ephedrae Herba_ ) 2 g, Xi Xin ( _Asari Radix et Rhizoma_ ) 2 g, Fu Zi ( _Aconiti Lateralis Radix Praeparaia_ ) 6 g, Chai Hu ( _Bupleuri Radix_ ) 12 g, Huang Qin ( _Scutellariae Radix_ ) 9 g, Dang Shen ( _Codonopsis Radix_ ) 10 g, Sheng Jiang ( _Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens_ ) 10 g, Zhi Gan Cao ( _Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma Praeparata Cum Melle_ ) 6 g, Da Zao ( _Jujubae Fructus_ )10 g, Che Qian Zi ( _Plantaginis Semen_ ) 20 g, Bai Zhu ( _Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma_ ) 10 g, Fu Ling ( _Poria_ ) 30 g, Tian Ma ( _Gastrodiae Rhizoma_ ) 12 g.\n\n【57】It was given in 3 doses, granules, 1 dose per day, to be taken in the morning and evening.\n\n【58】#### _02/23/2020_\n\n【59】The patient had a clear mind, low energy, and he mentioned significant improvement of symptoms; he felt a little shortness of breath after moving and mild chest distress in the morning; cough, swollen and numb feet, and bitter taste in the mouth were all alleviated compared to earlier; and his diet was OK. The peripheral oxygen saturation was 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Two nucleic acid detection tests for SARS-CoV-2 showed a negative result, and chest CT showed significant absorption of inflammation. The patient could be discharged from the hospital.\n\n【60】### Evaluation of Effectiveness\n\n【61】1\\. Changes in main symptoms\n\n【62】The patient’s body temperature returned to normal on the 4th day after admission, and he did not have a fever again; dyspnea improved significantly on the 4th day after admission. The peripheral oxygen saturation increased from 85% on admission to 95% while the patient was breathing ambient air.\n\n【63】2\\. Changes in body temperature and oxygen saturation\n\n【64】After the patient was admitted to the hospital, he received 4 days of treatment, the body temperature returned to normal ( Figure 2-8-9 ), the peripheral oxygen saturation increased while the patient was breathing ambient air, and was stable at 95% ( Figure 2-8-10 ).\n\n【65】Figure 2-8-9. Changes in body temperature.\n\n【66】Figure 2-8-10. Changes in peripheral oxygen saturation while the patient was breathing ambient air.\n\n【67】3\\. Changes in inflammatory indexes\n\n【68】After treatment, the absolute value of lymphocyte increased to normal ( Figure 2-8-11 ), the hypersensitive C-reactive protein decreased to normal ( Figure 2-8-12 ), the erythrocyte sedimentation rate decreased to normal ( Figure 2-8-13 ), and the serum ferritin also gradually decreased ( Figure 2-8-14 ).\n\n【69】4\\. Changes of chest CT\n\n【70】Chest CT scanned on February 10th showed that bilateral pulmonary lobe areas had flocculent strip shadow of uneven density with blurred margins, and ground-glass opacities change, and the left side was particularly severe. Chest CT re-examination on February 14th revealed that the flocculent lesions were somewhat absorbed, and the re-examination of lung CT on February 20th showed that the absorption of both lung lesions was significantly improved ( Figures 2-8-2 , 2-8-5 and 2-8-8 ).\n\n【71】Figure 2-8-11. Changes in lymphocyte.\n\n【72】Figure 2-8-12. Changes in hypersensitive C-reactive protein.\n\n【73】Figure 2-8-13. Changes in erythrocyte sedimentation rate.\n\n【74】Figure 2-8-14.

The inflammatory indexes returned to normal. Chest CT showed significant absorption of inflammation. The patient’s condition improved obviously, and he was discharged from the hospital on February 22nd. After discharge, he continued to take the herb. Later, through telephone follow-up, we were told that the patient had recovered well.\n\n【79】### Case Analysis\n\n【80】(1) When dampness toxin and plague evil affect the human body, it can hurt Yang Qi because of cold transformation, or it can transform into dampness-heat because of heat transformation; it also can hurt Yin because of dryness transformation. The patient had been sick for more than one month, and he received a variety of antibiotics and antiviral drugs, but he still had a fever, dyspnea, shortness of breath, and fatigue, and the symptoms were aggravated day by day. He was considered to be suffering from the inward invasion of plague toxin, and the consumption of healthy Qi. Due to the deficiency of both Qi and Yin, he had wheezing, fatigue, shortness of breath, the tongue color was red, with a thin coating, and the pulse was thready, rapid, and weak. So, Sheng Mai San was used as the main prescription. Sheng Mai San comes from the book named _Yi Xue Qi Yuan_ ( _Origins of Medicine_ ), which recorded that Sheng Mai San can “replenish Yuan Qi (primordial Qi) of the lung”. _Yi Fang Ji Jie_ ( _Variorum of Medical Recipes_ ) recorded that “Ren Shen ( _Ginseng Radix et Rhizoma_ ) has the nature of sweet and warm, can replenish lung Qi as a sovereign drug; Mai Dong ( _Ophiopogonis Radix_ ) is an antiperspirant, can moisten the lung and enrich the water, and clear the heart and purge the heat, as a ministerial drug; Wu Wei Zi ( _Schisandrae Chinensis Fructus_ ) has the nature of sour and warm, can astringe lung, engender fluid and receive dissipated Qi, as a supplement. Due to the heart governing blood and vessels, lung connecting all vessels, if we tonify the lung and clear the heart, then Yuan Qi (primordial Qi) is sufficient and the pulse is recovered. This is called Sheng Mai.” “If someone is about to die, the pulse is gone, taking Sheng Mai San can be revived, it has a great effect.” The patient also reported edema of the lower limbs (sometimes with pain) and loose stools; we considered that the downward diffusion of dampness turbidity and toxin evil was the etiology and pathogenesis, so we put Ji Ming San combined with Fu Ling Gan Cao Tang into use to move Qi and descend the turbidity, disperse cold-dampness, and induce diuresis to alleviate edema, as our purpose was to activate Yang and give a way out to evil Qi.\n\n【81】(2) In the second consultation, the patient’s tongue coating increased, the Yin fluid had recovered, the wheezing had slightly decreased, and the peripheral oxygen saturation increased to 90%. The patient complained of aversion to cold and low-grade fever at night, wheezing and shortness of breath while moving, low energy, and poor appetite, occasional nausea, and swelling and pain of both feet. _Huang Di Nei Jing_ ( _The Yellow Emperor’s Classic of Internal Medicine_ ) recorded that “check the color of the body and analyze the pulse, distinguish Yin and Yang first.” The patient had low energy, the color of his face was yellowish-black, and the pulse was weak, which were considered to be characteristics of fever with Yang deficiency of the Shao Yin stage. The 301st item of _Shang Han Lun_ ( _Treatise on Cold Pathogenic Diseases_ ) recorded that “When Shao Yin disease has just started, but there is a fever and the pulse is sunken, Ma Huang Fu Zi Xi Xin Tang governs.” The prescription can invigorate the Yang Qi and eliminate evil Qi. At the same time, the patient had a bitter taste in the mouth, did not want to eat, and occasionally had nausea, which were characteristics of Shao Yang disease. _Shang Han Lun_ ( _Treatise on Cold Pathogenic Diseases_ ) recorded the syndrome of Xiao Chai Hu Tang, stating that “Only one sign means that this is the syndrome of Xiao Chai Hu Tang, they do not have to be presented”. Xiao Chai Hu Tang has the effect of harmonizing and releasing the Shao Yang and strengthening Tai Yin. _Huang Di Nei Jing_ ( _The Yellow Emperor’s Classic of Internal Medicine_ ) recorded that “The separation and reunion of San Yang, the Tai Yang corresponds to open, Yang Ming corresponds to close, and Shao Yang is the pivot; the separation and reunion of San Yin are also like San Yang, Tai Yin corresponds to open, Jue Yin corresponds to close, Shao Yin is the pivot.” Shao Yang is the pivot of San Yang, Shao Yin is the pivot of San Yin, San Yin and San Yang are like the opening and closing of the door, and if we want to operate the change of Yin and Yang, the pivot is very important. If we delay or miss the right timing, it may lead to the inward invasion of evil Qi and lead to the development of the disease into a severe condition. Therefore, we used Ma Huang Fu Zi Xi Xin Tang and Xiao Chai Hu Tang to open up the pivot, and strengthen healthy Qi to eliminate evil Qi. It can also be understood as warming Shao Yin, replenishing Tai Yin, harmonizing Shao Yang, and opening Tai Yang, so that the evil Qi that invaded could diffuse outward. According to the book _Shang Han Lun_ ( _Treatise on Cold Pathogenic Diseases_ ), incurable diseases are more common in Shao Yin and Jue Yin, so the treatment of the disease in the Shao Yin stage was especially critical. After taking one dose of this prescription, on February 13, the patient’s symptoms improved significantly, the aversion to cold and fever disappeared, the shortness of breath significantly improved, and the peripheral oxygen saturation increased to 95%.\n\n【82】(3) _Shang Han Lun_ ( _Treatise on Cold Pathogenic Diseases_ ) divides the diseases into Yin and Yang. San Yang disease is mostly in the early stage of the disease and the nature of the disease is partial to the excess syndrome. San Yin disease is mostly in the late stage of the disease and the nature of the disease is partial to the deficiency syndrome. Therefore, in the treatment of San Yang disease, we should focus on eliminating evil Qi, and in the treatment of San Yin disease, we should strengthen healthy Qi at first in most cases. Strengthening healthy Qi has the difference between Yin and Yang, just as the doctor of the Qing Dynasty named Qin An Zheng said: “In the medical road, it is not difficult to use the herb, but difficult to recognize the symptoms, and it is not difficult to recognize the symptoms, but difficult to recognize Yin and Yang.” The plague often progresses quickly, so we must grasp the main syndrome characteristics of the current situation to make a judgment and adjust treatment according to the changes to reach the state of “Everyone who is at a state in which Yin and Yang are balanced, will self-heal” that _Shang Han Lun_ ( _Treatise on Cold Pathogenic Diseases_ ) recorded.\n\n【83】(4) Ma Huang ( _Ephedrae Herba_ ), Xi Xin ( _Asari Radix et Rhizoma_ ), Chai Hu ( _Bupleuri Radix_ ), and so on are dispersed herbs; if we use them for a long time, or use them in a large dose, they will consume healthy Qi. For one thing, we should use them with Fu Zi ( _Aconiti Lateralis Radix Praeparaia_ ), Dang Shen ( _Codonopsis Radix_ ), and other herbs to strengthen healthy Qi; for another thing, when the evil Qi dissipates, we should gradually reduce the dose, and even stop using it. The recovery period is mainly based on the cultivation and the replenishment of the spleen and stomach of Middle Jiao; the spleen and stomach are the foundation of acquired constitution, and the source of Qi and blood, just as _Jin Gui Yao Lue_ ( _Synopsis of Golden Chamber_ ) reported, “If the spleen Qi is sufficient, the person will not subject to evil Qi.”\n\n【84】(Bin Li, Xiaodong Cong, Qing Miao, Yiling Fan)", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

His diagnosis was \n\n【4】made several years previously while resident in India, on the basis of rashes, arthralgia, \n\n【5】ulcers and ‘lots of bad antibodies’. He was prescribed medication but admits he has never \n\n【6】complied except for a brief period when he took warfarin. He has become progressively \n\n【7】more breathless over the last few months, with his exercise tolerance falling from unlim￾ited to only a few metres. He admits that his lupus symptoms have also been deteriorating \n\n【8】over the same period. There is no history of cough or infective symptoms.\n\n【9】Examination\n\n【10】This man has a marked malar rash and is short of breath at rest (18 breaths per minute). \n\n【11】His oxygen saturations on room air are 92 per cent at rest and on minimal exercise drop \n\n【12】to 85 per cent. His pulse rate is 93/min, blood pressure 118/68 mmHg. His jugular venous \n\n【13】pulse (JVP) is elevated with systolic v waves, and he has a pansystolic murmur over the \n\n【14】tricuspid area. There is also pulsatile hepatomegaly and pitting oedema to his knees. \n\n【15】Examination of the respiratory system is unremarkable.\n\n【16】Questions\n\n【17】• What is the differential diagnosis for the patient’s breathlessness?\n\n【18】• How would you investigate him?\n\n【19】• What are the treatment options?268\n\n【20】100 Cases in Orthopaedics and Rheumatology\n\n【21】ANSWER 97\n\n【22】This patient has progressive breathlessness, desaturates on exercise and has features of \n\n【23】right heart failure and tricuspid regurgitation. The diagnosis is pulmonary arterial hyper￾tension (PAH). The three main causes of PAH in patients with lupus include:\n\n【24】• interstitial lung disease\n\n【25】• pulmonary vasculopathy\n\n【26】• chronic thromboembolism.\n\n【27】In this case, vasculopathy or chronic pulmonary embolisms are the most likely given \n\n【28】the absence of clinical features of interstitial lung disease and his prior history of \n\n【29】warfarinization.\n\n【30】! Appropriate investigations for PAH\n\n【31】Arterial blood gas Assessment of respiratory failure\n\n【32】Pulmonary function tests Identification of restrictive lung disease\n\n【33】 Evaluation of gas transfer as measure of disease severity\n\n【34】Chest X-ray Evidence of interstitial lung disease\n\n【35】 Peripheral ‘pruning’ of vascular tree in occlusive vascular \n\n【36】disease\n\n【37】Echocardiography Characterize degree of tricuspid regurgitation\n\n【38】 Estimation of pulmonary arterial pressure\n\n【39】 Evaluation of right ventricular function\n\n【40】CT-PA Investigation of chronic thromboembolic disease\n\n【41】HRCT Evaluation of interstitial lung disease (inflammatory vs fibrotic \n\n【42】change)\n\n【43】Cardiac catheterization Formal evaluation of right heart pressures\n\n【44】 Assessment of reversibility with vasodilators\n\n【45】In addition, the patient should have a full assessment for the complications of his SLE, \n\n【46】including an antibody and anti-phospholipid profile. His peripheral oedema is probably \n\n【47】due to right heart failure; and his blood pressure is normal, suggesting his renal system \n\n【48】is uninvolved, but nonetheless his urine should be checked for protein and/or casts.\n\n【49】Management of PAH in these circumstances is based on management of the resultant \n\n【50】right heart failure with diuretics, digoxin to improve ventricular contractility and lifelong \n\n【51】anticoagulation. Patients who demonstrate improvement in their pulmonary pressures \n\n【52】with vasodilators may benefit from calcium-channel blockade, intravenous prostacyclin \n\n【53】analogues or the endothelin antagonist bosentan.

You suspect that he is having withdrawal symptoms from chronic alcohol abuse and give IV lorazepam for immediate control of the seizures and plan to start him on oral chlordiazepoxide when he is more stable.\n\n【2】 What are the acute pharmacologic effects of ethanol?\n\n【3】 What are the chronic pharmacologic effects of ethanol?\n\n【4】 How is alcohol metabolized?\n\n【5】 What is the pharmacologic basis for using benzodiazepines to manage alcohol withdrawal?\n\n【6】ANSWERS TO CASE 23:\n\n【7】Drugs of Abuse\n\n【8】_Summary:_ A 50-year-old man is displaying symptoms and signs of acute alcohol withdrawal.\n\n【9】 Symptoms of acute ethanol toxicity: Disinhibited behavior and judgment, slurred speech, impaired motor function, depressed and impaired mental function, respiratory depression, cutaneous vasodilation, diuresis, gastrointestinal side effects, and impaired myocardial contractility.\n\n【10】 Symptoms of chronic ethanol toxicity: Alcoholic fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis, cirrhosis, liver failure, peripheral neuropathy, alcohol amnesic syndrome, pancreatitis, gastritis, fetal alcohol syndrome, nutritional deficiencies, cardiomyopathy, cerebellar degeneration.\n\n【11】 Metabolism of alcohol: Oxidized primarily in the liver but also in the stomach and other organs to acetaldehyde by the cytosolic enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase and by hepatic microsomal enzymes; acetaldehyde is oxidized to acetate by hepatic mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase.\n\n【12】 Benzodiazepines in alcohol withdrawal: Both alcohol and the benzodiazepines enhance the effect of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on GABA <sub>A </sub> receptors, resulting in decreased overall brain excitability. This cross-reactivity explains why relatively long-acting benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam, chlordiazepoxide) can be substituted for alcohol in a detoxification program.\n\n【13】#### CLINICAL CORRELATION\n\n【14】Ethanol is the most widely used CNS depressant. It is rapidly absorbed from the stomach and small intestine and distributed in total body water. Its exact mechanism of action is not known, but may be related to its generally disruptive effects on cell membrane protein functions throughout the body, including effects on signaling pathways in the CNS. At low doses it is oxidized by cytoplasmic alcohol dehydrogenase. At higher doses it is also oxidized by liver microsomal enzymes, which may be induced by chronic use. These enzymes are rapidly saturated by the concentrations of alcohol achieved by even one or two alcoholic drinks so that its rate of metabolism becomes independent of plasma concentration. Tolerance to the intoxicating effects of alcohol can develop with chronic use. Genetic variations in aldehyde dehydrogenase occur such that certain individuals display impaired ability to metabolize alcohol. The acetaldehyde metabolite accumulates in these individuals causing demonstrate a characteristic flushing of the skin upon drinking alcohol and increasing the likelihood of acute alcohol intoxication.\n\n【15】Cross-tolerance with barbiturates and benzodiazepines may also develop. Because of this cross-tolerance effect, benzodiazepines are the most commonly used agents for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal, a potentially life-threatening syndrome commonly seen 2–3 days after the abrupt cessation of alcohol use by a chronic abuser. A long-acting benzodiazepine can be taken, and gradually tapered, to mitigate this effect. Disulfiram is also used on occasion to manage alcoholism. It is a drug that inhibits aldehyde dehydrogenase that in the presence of alcohol causes an accumulation of acetaldehyde, which results in a highly aversive reaction consisting of flushing, severe headache, nausea and vomiting, and confusion. Naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, is yet another drug used to manage alcoholism.\n\n【16】APPROACH TO:\n\n【17】Pharmacology of Drugs of Abuse\n\n【18】#### OBJECTIVES\n\n【19】1\\. Define drug abuse, drug tolerance, drug dependence, and drug addiction.\n\n【20】2\\. List the common drugs of abuse and their properties.\n\n【21】3\\. List the adverse effects of the common drugs of abuse.\n\n【22】4\\. Describe pharmacological treatment of alcohol and nicotine addiction.\n\n【23】#### DEFINITIONS\n\n【24】Drug abuse: Nonmedical use of a drug taken to alter consciousness or to change body image that is often regarded as unacceptable by society. Not to be confused with drug misuse.\n\n【25】Drug tolerance: Decreased response to a drug with its continued administration that can be overcome by increasing the dose. A cellular tolerance develops to certain drugs of abuse that act on the CNS because of a poorly understood biochemical or homeostatic adaptation of neurons to the continued presence of the drug. Also, in addition to a cellular tolerance, a metabolic tolerance can develop to the effects of some drugs because they increase the synthesis of enzymes responsible for their own metabolism (alcohol, barbiturates).\n\n【26】Drug dependence: Continued need of the user to take a drug. Psychologic dependence is the compulsive behavior of a user to continue to use a drug, no matter the personal or medical consequences. Inability to obtain the drug activates a “craving” that is very discomforting. Physical or physiologic dependence is a consequence of drug abstinence after chronic drug use that results in a constellation of signs and symptoms that are often opposite to the initial effects of the drug and to those sought by the user. Psychologic dependence generally precedes physical dependence but, depending on the drug, does not necessarily lead to it. The development of physical dependence, the degree of which varies considerably for different drugs of abuse, is always associated with the development of tolerance, although the exact relationship is unclear.\n\n【27】Drug addiction: A poorly defined, imprecise term with little clinical significance that indicates the presence of psychologic and physical dependence.\n\n【28】#### DISCUSSION\n\n【29】##### _Class_\n\n【30】In addition to alcohol, the major drugs of abuse are nicotine, marijuana (Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol), and the CNS stimulants, notably cocaine and amphetamine and its derivatives ( Table 23–1 ).\n\n【31】Table 23–1 • DRUGS OF ABUSE\n\n【32】Three agents are approved for the pharmacological management of alcohol abuse. Disulfiram inhibits aldehyde dehydrogenase to increase the accumulation of acetaldehyde. Exposure to alcohol in the presence of this drug causes flushing, headache, palpitations, nausea/vomiting, and decreased blood pressure. These adverse reactions can discourage impulsive alcohol consumption. Naltrexone blocks the μ-opioid receptor to decrease alcohol cravings. It may be most effective in those with a genetic predisposition to alcohol dependence. Its use is limited by potential liver toxicity. A depot preparation of this drug is available. Acamprosate modulates glutamate neurotransmission by acting at central metabotropic glutamate receptors. Although this drug is generally well tolerated, its effectiveness remains equivocal. It can be combined with naltrexone.\n\n【33】Nicotine replacement for smoking cessation is available in patch, gum, inhaler, lozenge, and nasal spray. Patch provides a continuous supply of nicotine, whereas the other routes of administration provide the opportunity for the patient to respond to cravings. Patch, gum, and lozenges are available over the counter, whereas the inhaler and nasal spray require a prescription. Although nicotine is a vasoconstrictor, its use in smoking cessation is safe even in patients with cardiovascular disease. Varenicline is a partial agonist for nicotinic cholinoreceptor. Its partial agonist properties reduce nicotine withdrawal. By occupying the nicotinic cholinoreceptor, it prevents binding of nicotine to block the “reward” of smoking. Bupropion is an antidepressant that affects norepinephrine and dopamine systems. Its effectiveness in smoking cessation is independent of its antidepressant effects. Side effects include insomnia, agitation, and, rarely, seizures.\n\n【34】#### ", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

X-ray shows the presence of a pathological fracture of the pelvis. On questioning, the man reports that in recent months he has felt very fatigued and has been bothered by constant dull pain in his hips, back, and head. A radiograph of his skull is shown in the image. Laboratory studies show a serum calcium of 13.5 mg/dL and alkaline phosphatase of 60 U/L. Which of the following is an additional finding that would be likely in this patient?\n\n【1】> Reproduced, with permission, from USMLERx.com.\n\n【2】> (A) Blue sclerae\n\n【3】> (B) Facial muscle contraction on tapping the facial nerve\n\n【4】> (C) Hard prostatic nodule on digital rectal examination\n\n【5】> (D) Palpable parathyroid nodule\n\n【6】> (E) Proteinuria\n\n【7】 **Answer**: The correct answer is E . This patient is suffering from multiple myeloma. The x-ray shows multiple lytic “punched out” lesions in the skull, which is a classic finding for this plasma cell malignancy. Other areas of the skeleton commonly infiltrated by myeloma cells include the vertebrae, ribs, and pelvis, explaining the patient’s fracture in the absence of overt trauma. The lytic bone lesions are responsible for this patient’s hypercalcemia in the setting of normal alkaline phosphatase levels. Urinary protein (termed Bence-Jones proteins in this setting) is a common finding in multiple myeloma because the neoplastic plasma cells secrete an abundance of immunoglobulin proteins, with the light chains readily excreted. Excessive serum levels of immunoglobulin can lead to nephropathy or amyloidosis in these patients.  \n  \nAnswer A is incorrect . Osteogenesis imperfecta results from a defect in the synthesis of collagen I and leaves patients susceptible to pathologic fractures. In addition to brittle bones, insufficient collagen I can lead to abnormal dentition, conductive hearing loss, and a bluish hue in the sclera. However, this disease does not first present in late adulthood, and would not be associated with lytic bone lesions.  \n  \nAnswer B is incorrect . This is a description of Chvostek sign, which is a manifestation of neuromuscular hyperexcitability. This would be expected in a person with symptomatic hypocalcemia, not in a patient with hypercalcemia.  \n  \nAnswer C is incorrect . Although adenocarcinoma of the prostate commonly metastasizes to bone, it is an unlikely cause of this patient’s symptoms. Bone metastases from the prostate tend to produce dense and sclerotic osteoblastic bone lesions, rather than the lytic lesions seen on the radiograph. Moreover, one would expect an elevated alkaline phosphatase level in the setting of osteoblastic metastases.  \n  \nAnswer D is incorrect . Parathyroid adenomas are a common cause of hyperparathyroidism and consequent hypercalcemia. However, alkaline phosphatase levels should be markedly elevated in hyperparathyroidism. Moreover, parathyroid neoplasms are rarely malignant, and widespread skeletal metastases would not be expected in a patient with a parathyroid adenoma.\n", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a vasculitis (ie, inflammation of a blood vessel) characterized by inflammation affecting small to medium-sized arteries, particularly the renal, cardiac, and GI-tract vessels (usually not the pulmonary vasculature). As many as 30% of patients have had prior hepatitis-B infections.  \n  \nAnswer A is incorrect . Buerger disease, also known as thromboangiitis obliterans, is a vasculitis that mostly affects arteries and veins of the extremities. As such, patients often have intermittent claudication and Raynaud phenomenon. The majority of patients are men who are heavy smokers and show hypersensitivity to tobacco injected into the skin.  \n  \nAnswer B is incorrect . Giant cell (temporal) arteritis is a type of vasculitis that affects the arteries of the head, especially, of course, the temporal arteries. The highlights of this disease can be remembered by the mnemonic, JOE: patients get J aw pain and O cular disturbances from ischemia to the arteries supplying them. Patients also often have markedly elevated E rythrocyte sedimentation rates. The disease is often associated with the presence of polymyalgia rheumatica.  \n  \nAnswer C is incorrect . Kawasaki disease is a self-limited vasculitis that normally occurs in infants and children and is characterized by conjunctival and oral erythema, fever, erythema and edema of the palms and soles, generalized rash, and cervical lymph node swelling. About 20% of patients may go on to develop coronary artery inflammation and/or aneurysm.  \n  \nAnswer E is incorrect . Takayasu arteritis is a vasculitis characterized by fibrotic thickening of the aortic arch (it also affects the pulmonary arteries, the branches of the aortic arch, and the rest of the aorta in up to one-third of patients). Clinically, patients often have lower blood pressure and weaker pulses in the upper extremities than in the lower extremities; some patients have ocular disturbances as well.\n", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

He has wandered from his home， which is a common behavior among patients with dementia. He does not have a history of head trauma or neurologic symptoms， which may indicate a brain tumor， a subarachnoid hemorrhage， or an infection such as syphilis. Depression or stroke is also in the differential diagnosis. Thus， the workup of dementia includes a careful history and physical examination， an assay for vitamin B， deficiency， syphilis serology， HIV serology， thyroid function testing， testing for systemic lupus erythematosus， and CT imaging of the brain. The most common cause of dementia is Alzheimer disease， which has a predilection for those of advanced age. This individual has a moderate to severe form of the disease； more advanced disease may include immobility， being mute， and being severely disabled.**\n\n【9】**APPROACH TO ALZHEIMER DISEASE**\n\n【10】**Objectives**\n\n【11】春 Describe the pathology and microscopic findings of Alzheimer disease.\n\n【12】**Describe the pathology and microscopic findings of Parkinson disease.**\n\n【13】Describe the key differences between the neurologic degenerative diseases.\n\n【14】**Definitions**\n\n【15】Dementia： Slow onset of loss of cognitive function such as memory loss and confusion. Usually does not change from one day to the next.\n\n【16】**Delirium： Acute onset of mental status change， such as confusion， disori-entation， and agitation； often is due to drugs， hypoxia， or metabolic condition.**\n\n【17】**DISCUSSION**\n\n【18】**Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the eld-erly. The disease usually becomes apparent with slow impairment of higher intellectual function and alterations in behavior and mood. Later， progressive disorientation， memory loss， and aphasia indicate severe cortical dysfunction， and eventually the patient becomes noncommunicative and immobile.**\n\n【19】**Patients usually become symptomatic after 50 years of age， and the pro-gressive increase in the incidence of the disease in recent years has given rise to major medical， social， and economic problems in countries with a growing number of elderly individuals. When considered by age groups， the rates are3 percent for those aged 65 to 74 years， 19 percent for those aged 75 to 84 years， and 47 percent for those aged 85 years or more. Most cases are sporadic， but up to 10 percent of cases are familial. Pathologic changes identical to those observed in Alzheimer disease occur in almost all older patients with Down syndrome. Although histologic analysis of brain tissue is the “gold standard”for the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease， it rarely is needed in clinical practice. The combination of clinical assessment and modern imaging allows an accu-rate diagnosis in the vast majority of cases.**\n\n【20】**Pathologically， the brain shows a variable degree of cortical atrophy with widening of the sulci and ventriculomegaly because of the loss of brain tis-sue. The major microscopic abnormalities of Alzheimer disease are neurofib-rillary tangles， senile or neuritic plaques， and amyloid angiopathy. All these abnormalities may be present to a lesser extent in the brains of nonde-mented elderly people. The diagnosis of Alzheimer disease is based on a com-bination of clinical and pathologic features.**\n\n【21】**Neurofibrillary tangles are filament bundles in the cytoplasm of the neu-rons that displace or encircle the nucleus. They often have an elongated“flame” shape or take on a rounded contour. They are visible as basophilic fibrillary structures. They are found commonly in cortical neurons， especially in the entorhinal cortex； in pyramidal cells of the hippocampus； and in the amygdala. Neurofibrillary tangles are insoluble， and so they remain in tissue sections as “ghost”tangles long after the death of the neuron. Neurofibrillary tangles are composed predominantly of paired helical filaments with some straight filaments that appear to have a comparable composition. A major com-ponent of paired helical filaments is abnormally hyperphosphorylated forms of the protein tau， an axonal microtubule-associated protein that enhances micro-tubule assembly.**\n\n【22】**Neuritic plaques can be found in the hippocampus and amygdala as well as in the neocortex. The major motor and sensory cortex regions generally are spared. These lesions have been described as spherical in shape， taking up Congo red or silver stain， and tortuous in appearance. The amyloid core， which can be stained by Congo red， contains several abnormal proteins.**\n\n【23】**Although there is some disagreement about the best histologic criteria for Alzheimer disease， the number of neurofibrillary tangles correlates better**\n\n【24】**with clinical impairment than does the number of neuritic plaques. Although amyloid-rich plaques correlate less well with dementia and clinical disease than do neurofibrillary tangles， most current work has focused on the role of amyloid because of its relative specificity for Alzheimer disease and because of evidence from familial Alzheimer disease.**\n\n【25】**Familial Alzheimer disease accounts for a small minority of cases of Alzheimer disease， and genetic investigations suggest a role for amyloid pre-cursor protein (APP) and its processing to amyloid β-protein (Aβ) peptides in the pathogenesis of these cases. The gene that encodes APP is on chromosome21， and several forms of familial Alzheimer disease have been linked to muta-tions in the APP gene. These mutations lead to increased production of AB.**\n\n【26】Two other genetic loci linked to early-onset familial Alzheimer disease have been identified on chromosomes 14 and 1. They probably account for the majority of cases of early-onset familial Alzheimer disease. The genes on these two chromosomes encode highly related intracellular proteins： presenilin-1 and presenilin-2. Two mechanisms are proposed for the role of presenilins. First， mutations in the presenilins increase the production of AB， providing a genetic link for the deposition of amyloid. Second， the presenilins are also targets for cleavage by caspase proteases that are activated during apoptosis， suggesting a role for these proteins in neuronal cell death.\n\n【27】One allele， E4， of the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene on chromosome19 increases the risk of Alzheimer disease and lowers the age of onset. The percentage of individuals with the E4 allele is high in populations of patients with Alzheimer disease compared with control populations. ApoE can bind AB and is present in plaques， but the manner in which this allele increases the risk for Alzheimer disease is unknown.\n\n【28】**The course of Alzheimer disease is slow but progressive， with a sympto-matic period extending beyond 10 to 15 years. The early course of AD is dif-ficult to determine because the patient is usually a poor historian and because the early signs may be so subtle that they evade the notice of family members. These early features include impaired memory， difficulty with problem solv-ing， preoccupation with events long past， decreased spontaneity， and an inabil-ity to respond to the environment with the patient’s usual speed and accuracy. Patients may forget names， misplace household items， and forget what they were about to do. Often these individuals have insight into the memory deficits and occasionally relay their concerns to family members. Anomia， or difficulty with word finding， is common in the middle stage of Alzheimer disease. In the late stage of Alzheimer disease， physical and cognitive effects are marked. In the final stages， patients may become incontinent， mute， and unable to walk. Myoclonus with muscle tremors occasionally occurs. Mood disturbances such as depression are common. Alzheimer disease progresses at a slow pace to a state of complete helplessness. Intercurrent disease， often pneumonia， is usu-ally the terminal event for these individuals. See Table 13-1 for comparison of etiologies for degenerative diseases.**\n\n【29】**Table 13-1DEGENERATIVE DISEASES**\n\n【30】| DISEASE  | SIGNS/SYMPTOMS  | MACROSCOPICFEATURES  | MICROSCOPICFEATURES  | CHROMOSOMES  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Alzheimer disease  | Early： impaired memory， difficultywith problem solving， preoccupation with past events，decreased spontaneity Middle： difficulty with word finding Late： incontinence， mutism， immobility  | Cortical atrophy，widening of sulci，ventriculomegaly  | Neurofibrillary tangles， senile or neuritic plaques，and amyloid angiopathy  | Chromosome 19 (ApoE gene) Chromosomes 1，14，21  |\n| Pick disease  | Behavioral changes with personalityalterations and some language disturbances  | Cortical atrophy ofthe frontal and temporal lobes  | Pick bodies； Neuronal lossin the outer layers of the cortex  |  |\n| Parkinson disease  | Mask-like facies， stooped posture，slowness of voluntary movement，shuffling gait， cogwheel rigidity，“pill-rolling”tremor  | Pallor of the substantianigra and locus caeruleus  | Lewy bodies； Loss of the pigmented catecholaminergicneurons in the substantia nigra and locus caeruleus  |  |\n| Huntington disease  | Choreiform movements， dementia  | Small brain withatrophy of the caudatenucleus and putamen  | Loss of GABAergic neurons  | Chromosome4—expansion of CAG repeats  |\n\n【31】**APPROACH TO PICK DISEASE**\n\n【32】**Pick disease is a rare， distinct progressive dementia with lobar atrophy. Clinically， the patient experiences behavioral changes with personality(frontal lobe signs) alterations and some language disturbances (temporal lobe signs). A brain with Pick disease shows cortical atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes. In addition to the localized cortical atrophy， there is often bilateral atrophy of the caudate nucleus and putamen. The cortical gyri can be reduced to a thin wafer-like appearance. This pattern of lobar atrophy is often prominent enough to distinguish Pick disease from Alzheimer disease on macroscopic examination.**\n\n【33】**On microscopic examination， neuronal loss is most severe in the outer layers of the cortex. Some of the surviving neurons show Pick cells (with characteristic swelling) or contain Pick bodies. Pick bodies are slightly eosinophilic， cytoplasmic， round to oval filamentous inclusions. Pick bod-ies stain strongly with silver methods. They are composed of vesiculated endo-plasmic reticulum， neurofilaments， and paired helical filaments that are immunocytochemically similar to those found in Alzheimer disease. Unlike the neurofibrillary tangles of Alzheimer disease， Pick bodies do not remain after the neuron dies. In some cases with typical clinical history and macro-scopic findings of lobar atrophy， it is not possible to find either Pick cells or Pick bodies； nonetheless， these cases are classified as Pick disease.**\n\n【34】**APPROACHTO PARKINSON DISEASE**\n\n【35】**Parkinson disease is a syndrome characterized by limited facial expression， stooped posture， slowness of voluntary movement， shuffling gait， rigidity， and a“pill-rolling”tremor. These symptoms are seen in a number of condi-tions that include damage to the nigrostriatal pathway. Drugs that affect this system， such as dopamine antagonists and toxins， also may induce parkinson-ism. Parkinson disease usually appears later in life. The diagnosis is one of exclusion in which no toxic or other underlying etiology is known. Although there is no evidence for a genetic component in most cases， the disease can show autosomal dominant inheritance. In addition to the movement disorder. there are less-well-characterized changes in mental function， including dementia.**\n\n【36】**Degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra occurs in Parkinson disease. The severity of the motor syndrome is propor-tional to the dopamine deficiency， which can be corrected to some degree by replacement therapy with L-dopa， the immediate precursor of dopamine. Treatment does not， however， reverse the morphologic changes or arrest the progress of the disease， and with progression， drug therapy tends to become less effective and symptoms become more difficult to manage.**\n\n【37】**On pathologic examination， the typical macroscopic findings are pallor of the substantia nigra and the locus caeruleus. Microscopically， there is loss of the pigmented， catecholaminergic neurons in these regions associated with gliosis. Lewy bodies may be found in some of the remaining neurons. Lewy bodies are single or multiple intracytoplasmic， eosinophilic， round to elongated inclusions that often have a dense core surrounded by a pale halo. Lewy bodies are composed of fine filaments that are densely packed in the core but loose at the rim.**\n\n【38】Approximately 10 to 15 percent of patients with idiopathic Parkinson dis-ease develop dementia， with an increasing incidence with advancing age. Although many affected individuals also have pathologic evidence of Alzheimer disease， the dementia in others is attributed to widely disseminated Lewy bodies， particularly in the cerebral cortex.\n\n【39】**APPROACHTO HUNTINGTONDISEASE**\n\n【40】**Huntington disease (HD； Huntington chorea) is an inherited autosomal dominant disease characterized by progressive movement disorders and dementia. Motor symptoms often precede the cognitive impairment. The movement disorder of HD is choreiform， with increased and involuntary jerky movements of all parts of the body. Writhing movements of the extremities are typical. Some patients may develop parkinsonism with bradykinesia and rigidity later. Early symptoms of higher cortical dysfunction include forgetful-ness and thought and affective disorders， and there is progression to a severe dementia. HD patients have an increased risk of suicide， with infection being the most common natural cause of death. The disease is progressive， with the age at onset usually in the fourth and fifth decades and with an average course of approximately 15 years to death. Histologically， it is known for neuronal degeneration of striatal neurons， especially the caudate nucleus.**\n\n【41】**The HD gene， which is located on 4p16.3， encodes a predicted protein(huntingtin) with a molecular mass of 348 kD. The coding region of the gene contains a polymorphic CAG trinucleotide repeat in which patients with HD have an increased number of repeats. The normal HD genes contain 11 to 34copies of the repeat. The more repeats a patient has in the gene， the earlier the onset of the disease is. This disease is an example of “triple repeat mutation”disorders. The expanded repeat appears to result in protein aggregation and the formation of intranuclear inclusions.**\n\n【42】**Pathologically， the brain is small and shows atrophy of the caudate nucleus and， less dramatically， the putamen. The lateral and third ventricles are dilated. Also， atrophy is seen frequently in the frontal lobe. HD especially affects the neurons that use y-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as their neurotrans-mitters. There is a direct relationship between the degree of degeneration in the striatum and the severity of clinical symptoms.**\n", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Obsessions are recurrent and unwanted thoughts that are distressing to the individual. Compulsions are repetitive behaviors performed in response to obsessions to reduce distress (American Psychiatric Association 2013 ). OCD has lifetime and 12-month prevalence rates estimated to be 2.3 and 1.2 %, respectively (Ruscio et al. 2010 ). Roughly, two thirds of individuals with OCD report that they are severely impaired in various life roles, such as home management and work. For example, Ruscio et al. found that about half of those with OCD experienced obsessions for an average of 5.9 h a day and engaged in compulsions for 4.6 h a day. For those with clinically severe OCD, great impairment occurs in relationships and social functioning. Ninety percent of those with OCD meet criteria for another disorder at some point in their lives (Ruscio et al. 2010 ). There are high rates of comorbidity with major depressive disorder (MDD; 40.7 % comorbidity rate) and mood disorders in general (63.3 %), but other anxiety disorders are most common (75.8 % comorbidity rate; Ruscio et al. 2010 ).\n\n【14】Obsessions and compulsions are expressed in various ways, and the most common symptom dimensions are contamination, doubt/checking, symmetry, and unacceptable thoughts (Abramowitz et al. 2003 ). Individuals with unacceptable thoughts experience more shame and fear and less social acceptance than those with contamination or doubt/checking obsessions (Simonds and Thorpe 2003 ). Unacceptable thoughts may include themes that are religious, violent, or sexual (Williams et al. 2013 ). Violent obsessions can include fears of harming others or of committing suicide (Gordon 2002 ).\n\n【15】With the variety of symptom presentations, OCD is often misdiagnosed, with certain presentations more often misdiagnosed than others (Sussman 2003 ). One study found that misidentification rates were nearly 40 % across all symptom dimensions and significantly higher for vignettes that involved taboo thoughts in OCD versus contamination obsessions (Glazier et al. 2013 ). Misdiagnosis can cause a delay in appropriate treatment, which delays improvement in the individual, ineffectively utilizes health-care resources, and may result in worsened symptoms or drop out from treatment (Glazier et al. 2013 ). Additionally, a misdiagnosis (e.g., labeling someone with sexual obsessions about children as a pedophile) can lead to significant societal backlash and internal shame for the individual receiving the diagnosis.\n\n【16】Numerous studies have supported cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), specifically exposure and ritual/response prevention (ERP, as the treatment of choice for adults and children with OCD (Abramowitz et al. 2005 ; NICE 2006 ; Rosa-Alcazar et al. 2008 ). The treatment consists of psychoeducation, imaginal and in vivo exposures, and ritual/response prevention. Psychoeducation is designed to teach the individual about OCD and provide a rationale for treatment. Exposures allow the individual to contact feared triggers, either directly or through vividly imagining coming into contact with the stimulus. During exposures, the individual engages in response prevention, which is refraining from avoidance or neutralizing behaviors.\n\n【17】In terms of medicinal treatments for OCD, only serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. However, many patients fail to reach minimal levels of symptoms through the use of SRIs alone (Simpson et al. 2013a). Therefore, it is often recommended that SRIs are complemented by CBT or another medication in treating OCD. Despite treatment being effective for many, 38–46 % of participants who completed ERP combined with SRIs achieved minimal symptoms, indicating that many people fail to respond fully or at all to this treatment (Simpson et al. 2013a).\n\n【18】Functional analytic psychotherapy (FAP) is an interpersonally focused treatment that attempts to ameliorate problems that are rooted in relationships among people. FAP utilizes basic behavioral techniques, including shaping and reinforcement, during the therapy session in order to foster awareness, courage, and intimacy (Tsai et al. 2009 ). A few studies have examined the treatment of OCD through the use of FAP. Kohlenberg and Vandenberghe ( 2007 ) used FAP to target a patient’s avoidance and fear of being dependent on others, as well as her lack of trust. In addition, Vandenberghe ( 2007 ) described how FAP can be used to aid in treatment of OCD in conjunction with ERP. It has also been suggested that FAP may help target altering reactions to difficult emotions and problems with intimacy in OCD and related spectrum conditions (Wetterneck and Hart 2012 ).\n\n【19】Description of the Presenting Problem\n-------------------------------------\n\n【20】Paul is a Cuban-American high school teacher in his mid-40s, who has a young child with his wife. All three live together in a small Midwestern town. Paul presented to treatment due to intense, intrusive obsessive thoughts about committing suicide, with his main fear regarding the lasting effect that his suicide would have on his child and wife. While Paul denied suicidal intent and had no desire to kill himself, he feared that he would suddenly lose control and on impulse kill himself. Paul also feared that he would be unable to maintain his employment while battling his disturbing thoughts. He believed that his symptoms would become so bad that he would be forced to receive electroconvulsive therapy. In response to his obsessions, Paul spent several hours a day finding reassurance online and frequently from his wife that he would not harm himself. Paul also engaged in contingency planning on his own and with his wife, considering what actions his family would need to take if he were to become incapacitated due to a mental breakdown. He also reported difficulty focusing on his work and paying attention in class. He had difficulty enjoying things in his life, like time with his family, because of his obsessions and the excessive amount of time spent performing compulsions. He frequently ruminated for hours about the shame he would bring upon his family once friends, family members, and coworkers discovered that he had committed suicide. In addition, he likened his depressed mood to a “dark cloud” over all aspects of his life. Paul had previously received brief treatment (CBT with ERP) for OCD surrounding violent obsessions and was now receiving treatment for depression at a university center for mood disorders. He had no prior suicide attempts or psychiatric hospitalizations.\n\n【21】\nCase Information\n----------------\n\n【22】Paul’s obsessions about suicide did not appear to be completely unprovoked. When Paul was in his mid-20s, his youngest brother committed suicide by hanging himself. Although his brother was never diagnosed with a psychological disorder, Paul believed his brother suffered from bipolar disorder. In addition, Paul also had an uncle and two other relatives who had committed suicide. The fact that suicide seemed to “run in his family” intensified the fear that he might become so depressed one day that he would kill himself on impulse. These thoughts were unwanted, distressing, and ego-dystonic for Paul.\n\n【23】During his college years, Paul experienced a traumatic drug event with psilocybin mushrooms, which troubled him for the rest of his college years. Psilocybin mushrooms, otherwise known as “magic mushrooms,” can cause distortions in audio and visual senses. Even after 20 years, Paul cringed when he recalled this in session. He remembered seeing distorted faces and hearing unearthly sounds, which terrified him at the time. Shortly after that experience, Paul recalled listening to the radio and hearing a famous rock star talk about the damaging effects that drug use had on his brain. Paul then began experiencing intrusive thoughts about possible brain damage through the use of the mushrooms. He believed that his thoughts were triggered directly by hearing that radio show. These thoughts appeared to be his first bouts of OCD, but, at the time, he was not aware of this condition. Paul began reading and collecting information about the effects of hallucinogenic drugs on the brain. If Paul was exposed to any conversation or trigger that reminded him of hallucinogenic drugs or brain damage, he would experience heightened anxiety, which sent him into further investigation and rumination about whether or not he had caused irreparable damage to his brain.\n\n【24】Later in life, Paul sought treatment due to obsessions that he may harm others, which was diagnosed as OCD. His treatment lasted about six to eight sessions, and he received CBT with ERP. His aggressive obsessions reduced substantially; however, his fears about brain damage and suicide obsessions were not recognized or treated during this time.\n\n【25】When Paul initially presented for treatment, he was experiencing obsessions that he may harm himself, and that this would traumatize his young child and leave a huge burden on his wife. These obsessions led to constant feelings of depression that negatively affected his quality of life. Paul sought constant reassurance from his wife who was his only source of support and the only person who knew about his obsessions. Paul frequently required her to tell him that he was not really going to commit suicide and was not capable of that act. His fear was exacerbated by the intense feelings of depression that seemed to run parallel to his feelings of anxiety. He did not have an organized plan about how he might commit suicide, but he consistently avoided triggers to decrease the possibility of killing himself on impulse, despite these thoughts being distressing and ego-dystonic. He avoided dealing with sharp objects, and the idea of holding or making a noose caused a spike of anxiety. Paul’s fear led to time-consuming mental rituals, including latching onto news stories or movies about people who committed suicide. If a story about suicide flashed across a website, Paul would read the story searching for as many details as possible. If he deemed his life was dissimilar to the victim, he gained brief reassurance that he would not harm himself.\n\n【26】Paul reported that as a child he was raised in an environment in which there was no discussion of emotions and psychological issues. Despite his mother having many emotional outbursts and attempting suicide in front of Paul and his family members, these incidents were never discussed. Paul received only minimal explanations as to why these things were occurring. He even once witnessed his mother intentionally crash a car into a tree. Paul was always told “your mother is emotional” as a way to explain her actions. This led to Paul feeling as though his emotions were to be feared, a burden on others, and that they should be suppressed.\n\n【27】Case Conceptualization and Assessment\n-------------------------------------\n\n【28】Paul wondered if his worries were actually a result of OCD rather than depressive ruminations, and thus he sought consultation with an OCD specialist. He was assessed with the Yale–Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOCS; Goodman et al. 1989 ), Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI; Sheehan et al. 1998 ), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI; Beck 1990 ), Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II; Beck et al. 1996 ), Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ; Meyer et al. 1990 ), Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q; Endicott et al. 1993 ), and the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSSI; Beck et al. 1979 ). The results from the MINI indicated a diagnosis of OCD and MDD. At baseline, Paul scored 22 on the BDI-II (moderate depression), 30 on the YBOCS (severe OCD), 27 on the BAI (severe anxiety), 53 on the PSWQ (moderate worry), 46 on the Q-LES-Q, and 15 on the BSSI. Paul’s Q-LES-Q score indicates that his quality of life and enjoyment was average, with poor scores in the areas of mood, social relationships, overall sense of well-being, and medication.\n\n【29】Later into his treatment, Paul completed the Young Schema Questionnaire (YSQ; Young and Brown 1994 ) and the Functional Idiographic Assessment Template (FIAT; Callaghan 2006 ). The YSQ assesses for long-standing schemas that likely develop in childhood and adolescence and may interfere with treatment for Axis I conditions. The schemas are assessed based on the endorsement of maladaptive thoughts or behaviors that may have been functional earlier in life (e.g., avoidance of an emotion or situation one does not understand), but they are dysfunctional when applied and generalized to situations as an adult (e.g., avoidance of all emotion in general). It is not commonly used for OCD treatment, but it has been shown to relate to treatment outcome for OCD (Haaland et al. 2011 ). His results revealed themes of inconsistent relationships, not having relationships in which his needs are met, a general mistrust for others and his own feelings, and lacking someone he can depend on. The FIAT is designed to explore interpersonal strengths and weaknesses; Paul endorsed that he valued close relationships but has difficulties recognizing, expressing, and being receptive to his emotions within these contexts.\n\n【30】Paul’s symptoms are best understood with a cognitive-behavioral conceptualization of OCD. As suicide was prominent in his family, it is natural that he would have concerns about this, but it was Paul’s response to these thoughts that created difficulty for him. These frequent thoughts were significantly distressing, and he made efforts to reassure himself that he would not commit suicide. His intrusive thoughts about suicide led to him ruminating about contingency plans and always seeking his wife’s reassurance, which decreased his anxiety short term but led to more distress over time. Despite his attempts at reassurance, Paul was unable to completely avoid his intrusive thoughts of suicide, and their continued presence led to more distress. However, Paul’s suicidal thoughts were only associated with his OCD, and he indicated no intent or desire to commit suicide. This was key in terms of differential diagnosis; separating suicidal obsessions from true suicidal ideation or intent, which he did not experience. Paul’s BSSI score was elevated, which would normally indicate suicidal ideation. However, through the use of interviewing and self-report measures, it was concluded that Paul’s BSSI score was indicative of thoughts that were unwanted and obsessional rather than actual suicidal ideation. His responses on items on the BSSI reinforced this, as he endorsed “I would try to save my life if I found myself in a life-threatening situation,” “I do not accept the idea of killing myself,” and “I do not expect to make a suicide attempt.”\n\n【31】Engaging in rituals (e.g., devising contingency plans) resulted in distance from social and family activities, and this isolation contributed to his symptoms of depression. Avoiding his thoughts, seeking reassurance, and making contingency plans reinforced the notion that his thoughts were actually threatening, by proving to him that his methods were helping him avoid suicide. Due to the temporary reduction in anxiety, Paul saw his rituals as necessary strategies. Thus, he maintained the cycle of experiencing an intrusive thought, engaging in rituals, and experiencing brief relief from his anxiety.\n\n【32】", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

It began as one lesion and subsequently he has noticed four more. They are occasionally itchy or painful, and have not responded to over-the-counter treatments, including 40 % salicylic acid plaster or “freeze off” therapies. He denies any other medical problems, medications, or drug allergies.\n\n【10】He works in construction, and sometimes finds that the warts get rubbed and irritated by his heavy-duty gloves. He also admits to feeling embarrassed to shake people’s hands. He is interested in an “aggressive” treatment but also expresses a curiosity about hypnosis—a neighbor suggested it to him.\n\n【11】On examination, he is an overweight male with diffusely dry skin. His bilateral thumbs and left second digit have five large cauliflower-like verrucous plaques in a periungual distribution, with some noted dystrophy of the adjacent nail plates.\n\n【12】Diagnosis\n\n【13】Verruca vulgaris\n\n【14】Further Workup\n\n【15】Not indicated\n\n【16】Discussion\n----------\n\n【17】Verruca vulgaris (warts; Fig. 2.1 ) are benign skin growths caused by human papilloma virus, of which there are more than 100 serotypes. Different strains of the virus tend to have a predilection for different anatomic regions (glabrous versus non-glabrous skin, etc.)—common warts are typically caused by HPV 2 and 4, and genital warts are most attributed to HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 (the latter two most associated with squamous cell carcinomas of genital and cervical epithelia). Verrucae may be planar, cerebriform, filiform, or cystic in appearance. Diagnosis is typically based on clinical evaluation, but histopathology may be useful in differentiating large/recalcitrant lesions from verrucous carcinoma. In cases of extensive warts, a workup for immunodeficiency or compromise may be indicated.\n\n【18】Figure 2.1\n\n【19】Verrucous papules on the hands\n\n【20】Conventional treatment options are many, in that none is universally or predictably effective. Use of chemical therapies should be avoided in pregnant or breast-feeding women. A treatment algorithm would be generally as follows:\n\n【21】*   Topical salicylic acid solutions, gels, and plasters (ranging from 17 % to 40 %, available over the counter)\n    \n*   Paring—Using a 15-blade in the office, warts can be pared or shaved to the level of the lower epidermis (visualization of “bleeding points” or dermal capillaries is an endpoint). This allows for better penetration of medication or cryotherapy. At home, patients can be instructed to self-pare using a nail file or dull blade.\n    \n*   Liquid nitrogen application/cryotherapy—Liquid nitrogen is inexpensive, quick to apply, effective, and cold (−321 °F). Typically it requires several sessions spaced apart by 2–4 weeks for maximum efficacy, and each session may include two to three cycles of application with a 10 s thaw time per cycle.\n    \n*   Electrocautery—Using an electrodesiccator device, warts can be cauterized and removed. One should ideally take care to use a smoke evacuator system, to minimize both patient and practitioner exposure to aerosolized HPV particles in the generated smoke plume.\n    \n*   5-fluorouracil—This topical chemotherapeutic cream has virucidal properties and is available by prescription. It can be combined or alternated with salicylic acid to increase epidermal penetration.\n    \n*   Imiquimod—Imiquimod (Aldara™) 5 % cream is an immunomodulator that is Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for use for genital and perianal warts in patients 12 years or older. It induces skin cells to secrete interferon alpha and other cytokines. It can also be used off-label for non-genital warts, with less reliable efficacy.\n    \n*   Cantharidin/ podophyllin resin—Office-applied compounds secreted by the blister beetle and American May Apple tree, respectively, they cause blistering and necrosis of involved skin. Several treatments may be required.\n    \n*   Podophyllotoxin—This is a cytotoxic compound that tends to work better on mucosal surfaces and is used more commonly in the treatment of genital warts. Patients may apply it topically twice daily for 3 consecutive days per week and repeated weekly, not to exceed 4 weeks.\n    \n*   Sinecatechins—Veregen™ 15 % ointment is a water extract of green tea leaves from Camellia sinensis . It has been shown to inhibit enzymes related to viral replication, and is approved for use on genital warts.\n    \n*   TCA—Trichloroacetic acid is another means of physical destruction, via chemical coagulation of proteins.\n    \n*   Intralesional interferon, candida antigen, or bleomycin—The first two are considered forms of intralesional immunotherapy, whereas bleomycin is directly cytotoxic.\n    \n*   Oral cimetidine—At high doses, this type-2 histamine receptor antagonist displays immunomodulatory properties and may therefore treat warts; however, efficacy is variable. Dosing in adults and children is 20–40 mg/kg orally per day in divided doses every 6 h, not to exceed 2,400 mg/day in adults. There are many known drug interactions with cimetidine, so this medication should be used with caution.\n    \n*   Photodynamic therapy—Aminolevulinic acid is a photosensitizing chemical that can be used topically in combination with red or blue light, as an off-label treatment for verruca plana or other non-genital warts.\n    \n*   Shaving—Warts can be physically shaved off with a surgical blade (and specimens sent for pathology confirmation), but the presence of HPV in surrounding skin is often high thereby leading to a significant rate of recurrence. Additionally, scarring is a concern.\n    \n*   Laser (vascular or ablative)—The most expensive of the conventional treatment options, both vascular and ablative carbon dioxide lasers can be used to treat warts. These procedures are not likely to be covered by insurance and are also not without a rate of recurrence. Again, one should utilize a smoke evacuator during the procedure.\n    \n*   Biopsy—For warts that are especially large or resistant to therapy, consider a biopsy to rule out verrucous carcinoma.\n\n【22】An integrative approach to treatment would include several other options for non-responders to standard therapy:\n\n【23】*   Adhesiotherapy: This refers to the mechanical keratolysis that occurs with the overnight application and removal of heavy adhesive tape, such as the silver-colored mechanical duct tape. Although two randomized controlled trials did not show efficacy over placebo tape \\[ 1 , 2 \\] other studies have demonstrated a benefit \\[ 3 \\]. This method can also be combined with topical keratolytics and cytotoxic agents, such as salicylic acid and fluorouracil cream (see above).\n    \n*   Hypnosis: Suggestion and its associated placebo effect have a long history of enhancing wart resolution both in folklore and in the medical literature \\[ 4 , 5 \\]. The concept is that belief can change brain electrochemistry, leading to modification of cell-mediated immunity through psycho-neuro-endocrine effects on the immune system \\[ 6 \\].\n    \n*   Botanical approaches: Raw garlic cloves have been shown to have antiviral activity and can be rubbed onto the wart nightly, followed by occlusion \\[ 7 \\]. Topical tea tree oil has also been reported as successful in some cases \\[ 8 \\].\n\n【24】Case Discussion\n\n【25】The patient was treated with liquid nitrogen cryotherapy in the office after a discussion about risks, which here included permanent nail dystrophy. He was then given a nightly home regimen consisting of the following: (1) Soaking the hands in warm water for 5 min, (2) Using a nail file or dull blade to pare away the dead skin, (3) Applying fluorouracil 5 % cream to the warts under duct tape occlusion at bedtime, alternating nights with over the counter 17 % salicylic acid liquid to the warts under occlusion. He was unable to locate a true medical hypnosis practitioner where he lived, but he was coached to employ mindfulness and positive intention at home, actively envisioning his immune system fighting off the warts each night during the soaking/paring routine. He was seen subsequently for two more sessions of cryotherapy spaced apart by 4 weeks each, and by the fourth office visit, his warts had completely resolved.\n", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Describe the clinical features and treatment of major depressive disorder in children and adolescents. (EPA 1，4)\n\n【20】**_Considerations_**\n\n【21】This patient clearly meets criteria for major depressive episode with psychotic fea-tures. Although the depression seems to have been precipitated by her break-up with her boyfriend， the combination of vegetative symptoms， suicidal ideation， and auditory hallucinations points to major depression. Children and adolescents with major depression often report their mood as angry or mad as opposed to sad or depressed. In this patient's case， the description of the disorder is major depressive _episode， severe with mood-congruent psychotic features (Table 12-1)._\n\n【22】| Table12-1·DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR MAJORDEPRESSIVE EPISODE  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| WITH PSYCHOTIC FEATURES  |\n| The patient must have five or more of the following symptoms， which should be present duringa 2-wk period； this symptom picture must be significantly different from the patient's usualfunctioning. At least one of the symptoms must be depressed mood or anhedonia. ·Depressed mood Significantly decreased pleasure or interest in usual activities (adhedonia) ·A significant decrease or increase in appetite， weig ht loss (without dieting)， or weight gain (> 5% of body weight) ·Daily insomnia or excessive sleeping ·Psychomotor slowing (retardation) or agitation ·Decreased or absent energy · A sense of worthlessness or unusual feelings of guilt ·Decreased ability to concentrate or slowed thinking ·Thoughts of death (not just fear of death) or suicide The symptoms are not those of an episode of bipolar disorder， mixed. The symptoms are not better accounted for by schizophrenia， schizoaffective disorder， delusionaldisorder， or other psychotic disorders. The symptoms must cause the patient considerable distress or a decrease in functioning(social life， job， activities of daily living). The symptoms are not the effects of a medical illness or a substance (prescription or street drug).The symptoms are not part of normal bereavement following a loss. With psychotic features： Delusions or hallucinations are present. Specify whether mood-congruent or mood-incongruent. With mood-congruent psychotic features： Theme of the content of delusions or hallucinations isconsistent with mood state. With mood-incongruent psychotic features： Theme of the content of delusions or hallucinationsis inconsistent with mood state.  |\n\n【23】**_APPROACHTO：_**\n\n【24】**Major Depressive Disorder With Psychotic Features**\n\n【25】**DEFINITIONS**\n\n【26】**ANHEDONIA： Loss of a subjective sense of pleasure.**\n\n【27】MOOD-CONGRUENT DELUSIONS OR HALLUCINATIONS： The content of the delusions or hallucinations reflects the nature of the illness. For example， in major depression， delusions and hallucinations are often about being defective， deficient， diseased， or guilty and deserving of punishment.\n\n【28】PSYCHOSIS： A syndrome characterized by hallucinations and/or delusions(fixed， false beliefs). The individual's ability to assess reality is impaired.\n\n【29】SOMATIC DELUSIONS： False beliefs about one’s body； in depression， these are usually beliefs regarding illness， for example， that one has cancer and is about to die.\n\n【30】VEGETATIVE SYMPTOMS： Symptoms of depression that are physiologic or are related to body functions， such as sleep， appetite， energy， and sexual interest. Other symptom categories for depression are cognitive (poor concentration， low self-esteem) and emotional (crying spells).\n\n【31】**CLINICAL APPROACH**\n\n【32】**_Clinical Presentation_**\n\n【33】Studies suggest the prevalence of major depression is 0.3% in preschoolers， 3% in elementary school children， and 6% to 7% in adolescents. Genetic factors， loss of a parent at an early age (before the age of 11)， and adverse early life experiences are significant predictors for major depression in childhood and adulthood. Depressed youths often present first to their pediatricians with complaints of sudden onset of anger and irritability， lack of interest in fun activities， decreased energy， sudden poor grades (caused by decreased ability to concentrate)， staying up late (under the claim of wanting to watch TV but really because the patient has trouble falling asleep)， and withdrawal from friends and family.\n\n【34】Suicidal Ideation. It is very important to inquire about psychotic symptoms and suicidal thoughts. Suicide is the third leading cause of death in adolescents. The rate is 18.25/100，000 in males and 3.48/100，000 in females. Females attempt more often， but males use more lethal means. Suicide rates in children and adolescents aged 5 to 19 years have shown a steady decrease from 1988 until 2003， in large part because of the increased recognition of depression in youth and the subsequent provision of treatment； however， the suicide rate has increased over the past decade. Interestingly， while most depressed persons who commit suicide seek professional help 1 month prior to committing suicide， most are not on an antidepressant at the time of suicide. This suggests that a lack of implementing effective treatment is a major problem. Diagnosis is often complex because there are many comorbid dis-orders such as anxiety disorders， disruptive behavior disorders， or substance abuse that can confuse the picture. Similarly， many personality disorders can be seen in adolescence and need to be considered as well. Various medical conditions and sub-stances can also cause mood disorders (see Case 10).\n\n【35】_Differential Diagnosis_\n\n【36】Bipolar Disorder. Other mood disorders such as bipolar disorder and dysthymia can be difficult to differentiate from major depressive disorder. Sometimes， a patient with bipolar disorder has several episodes of depression before the first episode of mania， and examining a carefully recorded family history and clinical history can raise the clinicians suspicion of bipolar disorder.\n\n【37】Dysthymia. Occasionally， a patient has an episode of major depressive episode superimposed on lifelong dysthymia， making the diagnosis difficult. Schizoaffective disorder includes both depressive and psychotic symptoms； knowledge of the his-tory and course of the illness is often necessary to make a diagnosis. Patients with s scchh1i2zophrenia can experience episodes of depression， but these usually developlater in the course of the illness， and the predominant picture is one of psychosis and negative symptoms. An active substance dependence makes the diagnosis of depression difficult because depressive and psychotic symptoms accompany the use\n\n【38】of many substances (such as alcohol or cocaine)； these can be indistinguishable from major depressive episodes. Often a patient must abstain from the substance for several weeks before a diagnosis can be confirmed.\n\n【39】Bereavement. In normal bereavement， especially during the first 2 months after the loss of a significant other， an individual can have symptoms of a major depres-sive episode. However， these gradually diminish with time. According to DSM-5， a distinct diagnosis of major depressive episode can be made in bereavement if the person meets criteria and it causes considerable impairment in functioning. Indica-tions include a preoccupation with guilt， feeling that one has caused the death of the loved one， and suicidal thoughts. It is important to remember that children and adolescents with normal bereavement will often have hallucinatory phenomena where they will see or hear the deceased loved one， often with messages that are reassuring and comforting. These are usually not signs of a psychotic depression. Hostile accusatory hallucinations are more typical of a major depressive episode with psychotic features.\n\n【40】**_Treatment_**\n\n【41】Pbarmacotberapy and Psychotherapy. The American Academy of Child and Ado-lescent Psychiatry (AACAP) has developed practice parameters for the treatment of major depressive disorder. According to AACAP， this patient should initially be started on an SSRI and an atypical neuroleptic along with supportive psycho-therapy to help stabilize her. The doses of either medication should be increased gradually until a therapeutic response is achieved， a maximum dose for body size is reached with no response， or the patient is experiencing side effects. If the patient's depression has no response or only a partial response to an adequate trial of the first SSRI， an alternative SSRI should be tried. If that fails to produce a response， consideration should be given to switching to a different class of antidepressant. Similarly， if one atypical antipsychotic does not control the psychotic symptoms with adequate dosing， a switch to another should be considered.\n\n【42】If the child suffering from a major depressive episode with psychotic features responds to the combination of antidepressant and atypical antipsychotic， the atypical antipsychotic should be continued for 3 months and then tapered off. The antidepressant should be continued for 6 to 12 months and then tapered over 2 to3 months.\n\n【43】Once the patient is stable， a course of cognitive behavioral psychotherapy along with medication should be utilized. This psychotherapy focuses on the child's auto-matic negative thinking when stressful events happen. This adds to the stress of the event and can predispose patients to depressive episodes.\n\n【44】Controversy with Medical Management. In October 2004， the FDA issued a black box warning regarding the possible increased risk in suicidality as evidenced by a twofold increase of suicidal behavior in pediatric populations who were not actively suicidal at the time antidepressants were prescribed. Debate about this finding continues； varying opinions include that this finding is the result of inad-equate dosing with antidepressants (allowing the depression to progress)， the result of an adverse effect of akathisia， or a medication-produced switch from depression to a bipolar mixed state. The effect of the warning on many physicians and the general public was marked. Gibbons et al found that from 2003 to 2005，\n\n【45】the use of antidepressants decreased in all patient populations， with a 20% decrease in children up to the age of 14 years. At the same time， the suicide rates for youth aged 5 to 19 years increased 14% from 2003 until 2004. Today， most psychiatrists would hold that youth with major depressive disorder should receive antidepres-sant treatment with close monitoring. A study in 2013 indicated that 3.9% of US adolescents were on antidepressants， usually for depression or anxiety disorders.\n\n【46】**CASE CORRELATION**\n\n【47】_●_ See also Case 8 (Bipolar Disorder \\[Child\\])， Case 11 (Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder)， and Case 13 (Major Depressive Disorder).\n", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

She reports that the rash began on her legs but quickly spread to her trunk, arms and ears over the past 48 hours. The lesions were initially non-tender but have become intensely tender to palpation. Her past medical history is notable for polysubstance abuse and infective endocarditis. On examination, there are numerous purpuric plaques with irregular, stellate borders. Some of the larger lesions have hemorrhagic bullae in the centre with evidence of necrosis ( 21 ).\n\n【4】i. What is the diagnosis and causative agent?\n\n【5】ii. What are the other associated findings that can be seen with this condition?\n\n【6】iii. What are the available treatment options?\n\n【7】Answer 21\n\n【8】i. The patient presents with levamisole vasculopathy or retiform purpura due to levamisole-adulterated cocaine. Although levamisole was initially developed as an antihelminthic agent, it has been used more recently for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, nephrotic syndrome and colon and breast cancer until it was withdrawn due to adverse effects of agranulocytosis, cutaneous vasculitides and leukoencephalopathy. More recently, it has been used to cut cocaine, detected in >70% of cocaine tested in the United States in 2009. It is thought to increase the euphoric and stimulatory effects of cocaine by forming amphetamine-like metabolites.\n\n【9】Patients who develop levamisole vasculopathy experience an acute onset of a purpuric rash that affects the extremities and trunk and characteristically affects the ears and nose. These lesions often progress to ulceration and necrosis and can lead to significant morbidity due to scarring.\n\n【10】ii. In a review of cases of levamisole vasculopathy, antiphospholipid antibodies and antinuclear cytoplasmic antibodies were detected in 65% and 91% of the cases, respectively.\n\n【11】iii. After withdrawal of the offending agent, skin lesions resolve over 2–3 weeks, but can lead to profound scarring. Serologies normalize within 2–14 months.

The patient relates that he has been having intermittent pain throughout the abdomen for the past 12 hours， and since the onset of pain， he has vomited twice. His past medical history is significant for hypertension and colon cancer for which he underwent laparoscopic right colectomy 8 months ago. The patient indicates that he has not had any recent abdominal complaints. His last bowel movement was 1 day ago， and he denies any weight loss and hemato-chezia. On physical examination， the patient is afebrile. The pulse rate is 98 beats per minute， blood pressure is 132/84 mm Hg， and respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute. His cardiopulmonary examination is unremarkable. His abdomen is obese， mildly distended， with well-healed surgical scars. No tenderness， guarding， or hernias are noted. His bowel sounds are diminished， with occasional high-pitched sounds. The rectal examination reveals normal tone， empty rectal vault， and hemoccult-negative stool.\n\n【1】What is the most likely cause of this patient's problems?\n\n【2】What are the next steps in this patient’s evaluation?\n\n【3】**ANSWERS TO CASE 20：Intestinal Obstruction**\n\n【4】Summary： A 55-year-old man with history of previous laparoscopic surgery for the resection of right colon carcinoma presents with intermittent abdominal pain and vomiting. The physical examination reveals no abdominal wall or groin hernias， no tenderness， and high-pitched bowel sounds.\n\n【5】· Most likely diagnosis： Bowel obstruction. It is unclear whether the intestinal obstruction is involving the large or small bowel， or whether it is complete or oartial obstruction.\n\n【6】●Next steps in evaluation： Diagnostic radiography， which can be either plain x-rays or computed tomography (CT).\n\n【7】**ANALYSIS**\n\n【8】_Objectives_\n\n【9】1\\. Learn to recognize the clinical presentations of intestinal obstruction (small bowel and colon).\n\n【10】**2\\. Learn the common causes of bowel obstructions.**\n\n【11】3\\. Learn the approach in the selection of imaging modalities for the evaluation of patients with possible bowel obstruction.\n\n【12】4\\. Learn to recognize clinical and radiographic signs of complicated obstruction and the urgency associated with its management.\n\n【13】**_Considerations_**\n\n【14】In this patient scenario， the differential diagnosis for obstruction includes intesti-nal ileus， adhesions， ischemia， and obstruction from recurrence of metastatic colon carcinoma. For this individual， the probability of ileus as the cause of his abdominal symptoms is unlikely， because he has a history of crampy abdominal pain and find-ings of high-pitched bowel sounds， which are clinical features compatible with mechanical obstruction and not functional obstruction. The first imaging study to consider can be an abdominal series or CT scan. The radiographic studies will help to distinguish partial obstruction from high grade， complete obstruction. The abdominal series may delineate the level of obstruction. The presence of stool or air in the rectal vault may suggest a partial obstruction， whereas the presence of air and fluid levels in the small intestine， with the absence of stool and air through-out the colon， indicate a high-grade， small-bowel obstruction. His past history of colon cancer points to the possibility that recurrent cancer may be the cause of his bowel obstruction； thus， a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen may be helpful in identifying any obstructing tumor masses. In addition， CT scan can help identify a transition point in the GI tract where the luminal diameter of the bowel changes， thus differentiate a mechanical obstruction from a functional obstruction.\n\n【15】CLOSED-LOOP OBSTRUCTION： Blockage occurs both proximal and distal to the dilated segment preventing decompression. Examples include an isolated loop of small bowel caught in a tight hernia defect， a twisting of the bowel on itself causing a volvulus， or a complete large-bowel obstruction in a patient with a competent ileo-cecal valve. These obstructions are unlikely to resolve with nonoperative therapy.\n\n【16】**COMPLICATIONS OF BOWEL OBSTRUCTION： Ischemia， necrosis， or perforation as a result of obstruction.**\n\n【17】CT SCAN OF THE ABDOMEN： This modality is increasingly used in the evalu-ation of patients with bowel obstruction. CT can help to differentiate functional obstruction from mechanical obstruction. It is also useful in the evaluation of patients with previous abdominal malignancy to help determine if the obstruction is related to tumor recurrence. In addition， there are a number of CT characteristics that will identify high-grade， complicated obstructions， and differentiate these from uncomplicated obstructions. Disadvantages of CT in comparison to plain abdominal radiographs include intravenous contrast exposure that has the potential of causing acute kidney injury in a patient who is hypovolemic， and excessive exposure to ion-izing radiation that could have significant late carcinogenic effects.\n\n【18】FUNCTIONAL OR NEUROGENIC OBSTRUCTION： Luminal contents cannot pass because of bowel motility disturbances preventing peristasis. Etiologies include neurogenic dysfunction， medication-related or metabolic problems， bowel wall infiltrative processes such as collagen vascular diseases， or extraluminal infiltra-tive processes such as peritonitis or malignancy. Surgery generally does not improve the above conditions； however， complications related to the above conditions may require operative intervention.\n\n【19】MECHANICAL OBSTRUCTION： Luminal contents cannot pass through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract because of a mechanical obstruction. The treatment can be operative or nonoperative depending on the cause， severity， and duration of the obstructive process.\n\n【20】OPEN-LOOP OBSTRUCTION： Intestinal blockage is distal， allowing proximal bowel decompression of obstruction via nasogastric (NG) suction or emesis.\n\n【21】SIMPLE (UNCOMPLICATED) BOWEL OBSTRUCTION： Partial or complete obstruction of the bowel lumen without compromise to the intestinal blood flow.\n\n【22】UPPER GI-SMALL-BOWEL FOLLOW THROUGH： This is contrast radio-graphy done following the administration of oral contrast. The study accurately localizes obstruction site and caliber in the small bowel. The administration of con-trast may be associated with worsening of obstruction and aspiration. This study is rarely indicated in the ED setting.\n\n【23】**CLINICAL APPROACH**\n\n【24】**The causes of bowel obstruction in young children (<5 years of age) are quite different than those found in the adult population. The following discussion is limited to adult patients. Adhesions represent the most common cause of small-bowel obstruction whereas colorectal carcinoma is the most common cause of large-bowel obstruction in developed countries. Table 20-1 lists the distribution and clinical features associated with obstructive causes.**\n\n【25】_Pathophysiology_\n\n【26】With mechanical obstruction， air and fluid accumulate in the bowel lumen. The net result is an increase in the intestinal intraluminal pressure， which inhibits fluid absorption and stimulates the influx of water and electrolytes into the lumen. Eighty percent of air found inside the bowel lumen is swallowed air (see Figure 18-1). Because of this， NG tube decompression may be useful in preventing progression of bowel distension. Initially following the onset of mechanical obstruction， there is an increase in peristaltic activity. However， as the obstructive process progresses(usually >24 hours)， coordinated peristaltic activity diminishes along with the contractile function of obstructed bowel， giving rise to dilated and atonic bowel proximal to the point of obstruction. With this progression， the patient may actually appear to improve clinically with less frequent and less intense crampy abdominal pain. The effects of mechanical obstruction on intestinal blood flow include an initial increase in blood flow. With unrelieved obstruction， blood flow diminishes leading to a breakdown of mucosal barriers and an increased susceptibility to bacterial invasion and ischemia.\n\n【27】| **Table 20-1·SMALL-VS LARGE-BOWEL OBSTRUCTION**  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Small-Bowelobstruction**  | **Large-Bowel Obstruction**  |\n| **Causes** **· Adhesions (70%-75%)** **Malignancy (8%-10%)** **·Hernia (8%-10%)** **·Volvulus (3%)** **· Inflammatory bowel disease (1%)** **· Intussusception， gallstone ileus， radiationenteritis， intra-abdominal abscess， bezoar(all<1%)**  | **Causes** **·Carcinoma (65%)** **·Volvulus (15%)** **·Diverticular disease (10%)** **·Hernias， peritoneal carcinomatosis， fecalimpaction， ischemic colitis， foreign body，** **inflammatory bowel disease (total 10%)**  |\n| **Symptoms** **·Vomiting (more common with proximalobstruction)** **· Cramping pain (common， early)** **·Distension (variable， with greater distensionseen with distal obstruction)**  | **Symptoms** **·Distension (common and usually significant)·Postprandial cramps and bloating (very** **commoni** **·Vomiting (unusual)** **·Bowel habit changes (common)**  |\n\n【28】**_Clinical Presentation_**\n\n【29】The common clinical manifestations of bowel obstruction are pain， emesis， con stipation， obstipation， distension， tenderness， visible peristalsis， and/or shock. The presence or absence of these signs and symptoms are dependent on the severity of the obstruction. Pain associated with bowel obstruction is generally severe at the onset and is characterized as intermittent and poorly localized. With the progression of small-bowel obstruction， spastic pain decreases in intensity and frequency. How-ever， continuous pain may develop as the result of ischemia or peritonitis. Patients with large-bowel obstruction， pain frequently present with postprandial crampy pain， and some patients with chronic large-bowel obstruction may describe the symptoms as indigestion. Continuous pain may also develop with the progression of marked distension， ischemia， or perforation.\n\n【30】Emesis is a symptom found commonly in patients with intestinal obstruction. In general， patients with proximal obstruction of the small bowel report the most dramatic episodes， whereas patients with distal obstructions may not experience as much emesis. The quality of the material vomited may help indicate the level of obstruction， as obstruction in the distal small bowel may produce feculent vomitus. Contrary to common beliefs， obstruction of the large bowel often is not associ-ated with vomiting， because the presence of a competent ileocecal valve (found in50%-60% of individuals) frequently contributes to a closed-loop obstruction.\n\n【31】Absence of bowel movements and flatus are suggestive of a high-grade or complete obstruction. With the stimulation of peristalsis at the initiation of an obstructive episode， it is not unusual for a patient to describe having bowel move-ments. The presence of a recent bowel movement does not rule out the diagnosis of a bowel obstruction. The classic description of decreased stool caliber is infrequently reported by patients with large-bowel obstruction， and when reported， this finding is not specific for colonic obstruction. On the other hand， diarrhea is frequently18110reported by patients with progressive large-bowel obstruction. Presumably， with high-grade narrowing of the bowel lumen， passage of the solid and semisolid con-tents are blocked， therefore the stools become more liquid in character. Distension to some degree is generally observed in most patients with intestinal obstruction； however， this finding may be absent in patients with obstruction of the proximal small bowel； therefore， the absence of distension does not eliminate the possibility of intestinal obstruction.\n\n【32】Patients with uncomplicated obstruction usually have mild， ill-defined， non-localized abdominal tenderness. The tenderness results from distension of the bowel wall leading to the aggravation of visceral pain. In the case of open-loop obstruc-tion， decompression by emesis or NG tube frequently results in the improvement or resolution of abdominal tenderness. Localized tenderness is a finding that is infrequently encountered in patients with uncomplicated bowel obstruction， and the presence of localized tenderness is suggestive of complications involving an isolated bowel segment. The presence of this finding should raise the suspicion for a closed-loop obstruction， bowel necrosis or perforation， and in patients without obvious need for urgent operative treatment， further evaluation with CT scan may be beneficial.\n\n【33】| **CT Finding**  | **Clinical Implications Associated With Finding**  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Dilated small bowel (>2.5 cm) with** **transition to normal-sized bowel**  | **Mechanical small bowel obstruction (SBO)**  |\n| **\\>50% diameter difference betweenproximal dilated small bowel and distalsmall bowel**  | **High-grade SBO**  |\n| **Small-bowel feces**  | **Moderate-to high-grade obstruction**  |\n| **Intraperitoneal free fluid**  | **This finding in the setting of SBO suggestshigh-grade SBO**  |\n| **Thickened small bowel wall**  | **High-grade obstruction**  |\n| **Target sign**  | **Intussusception**  |\n| **Swirl sign**  | **Internal hernia or volvulus**  |\n| **Reduced bowel wall enhancement**  | **Ischemic bowel wall**  |\n| **Pneumatosis intestinalis**  | **Ischemic bowel wall/necrosis**  |\n\n【34】**MANAGEMENT OF SMALL-BOWEL OBSTRUCTION**\n\n【35】When identified early， patients with uncomplicated small-bowel obstruction should be managed by NPO， intravenous hydration， and NG tube decompression. This therapy is directed at correcting the fluid and electrolyte deficits and reversing the cycle of inflammatory and metabolic events associated with increased intestinal luminal pressures. Many patients with early， partial small-bowel obstruction can be successfully managed without further problems. Patients with suspected small-bowel obstruction should undergo CT imaging， which may help differentiate uncompli-cated small-bowel obstructions from complicated obstructions and help identify patients at risk of developing complicated obstructions.\n\n【36】**Typically， patients who present late in the course of obstruction are less likely to resolve with nonoperative management. Furthermore， in these patients with prolonged obstruction， the probability of bowel ischemia and necrosis is increased. The development of complicated small-bowel obstruction is associated with increase morbidity and mortality； therefore， every effort should be made to identify and ini-tiate early treatment in these patients. No clinical， laboratory， and radiographic criteria will reliably predict and identify patients with small-bowel obstruction who will go on to develop bowel necrosis. The presence of fever， tachycardia， persistent abdominal pain， abdominal tenderness， leukocytosis， and high-grade obstruction are associated with the increased likelihood of bowel necrosis. These findings should prompt early referral to a surgeon， and patients with these findings are more likely to benefit from early surgical interventions.**\n\n【37】The nonoperative approach does not address the source of the small-bowel obstruction. Therefore， prolonged nonoperative therapy would be considered inap-propriate for patients with surgically correctable causes such as abdominal wall and groin hernias and obstructing neoplasms. Similarly， patients with no previous abdominal operations and no defined causes for intra-abdominal adhesions should undergo resuscitation and prompt evaluation to identify a possibly treatable source of obstruction (eg， Crohn disease， tumors， volvulus， and internal hernias).\n\n【38】**MANAGEMENT OF LARGE-BOWEL OBSTRUCTION**\n\n【39】Patients with large-bowel obstruction are often older and more severely dehydrated and should be managed with nasogastric suction， intravenous fluid hydration， and close monitoring for their responses to fluid resuscitation. Patients with inappro-priate response to fluid resuscitation may require admissions to an intensive care unit where invasive monitoring may be used to guide the resuscitation efforts； alter-natively， poor response to initial fluid resuscitation could indicate complications such as perforations and/or bowel necrosis， therefore early surgical interventions may be needed.\n\n【40】The major diagnostic dilemma in patients with suspected large-bowel obstruction is differentiating mechanical obstruction from functional obstruction (dysmotility). In most patients， a CT scan will help make the differentiation. When mechani-cal and functional obstruction cannot be differentiated by CT imaging， a contrast enema without bowel preparation may be obtained.\n\n【41】Colorectal carcinoma is by far the most common cause of mechanical large-bowel obstruction. The site of obstruction of colon carcinoma correlates to the luminal diameter of the large bowel， rather than with the frequency of distribu-tion of carcinoma. The generally reported frequency of distribution of obstructing colorectal carcinoma is splenic flexure (40%)， hepatic flexure (25%)， descend-ing and sigmoid colon (25%)， transverse colon (10%)， and ascending colon and cecum (10%). Less commonly， sigmoid volvulus， and diverticular disease may cause large-bowel obstruction， in these settings the plain radiographs generally will identify the sigmoid volvulus. When identified， the volvulus may be evaluated and resolved by proctosigmoidoscopy performed without bowel preparation. Because nearly all patients with large-bowel obstruction will require operative treatment， surgical consultations should be obtained early in these patients.\n\n【42】One of the most devastating complications associated with large-bowel obstruc-tion is colonic perforation， which generally occurs in the cecum or right colon. The risk for developing colonic perforation is increased among patients with severely dilated colon (>10 cm cecal diameter). These patients may or may not present with frank peritonitis； however， most patient will have severe volume contraction as a consequence of the ongoing inflammatory changes. The diagnosis of colonic perforation should be entertained when patients fail to improve with aggressive fluid management.\n", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The glucose-positive urine dip， elevated fasting glucose， 2-hour glucose， and HbA1c all support a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Sometimes， children with Type 1 diabetes mellitus are asymptomatic and diagnosed after an incidental finding during a physical exam. Other times， a diagnosis may result from the child's presenting to the emer-gency department in diabetic ketoacidosis or after presenting with the classic new-onset symptoms of polyuria， polydypsia， and polyphagia. Appetite is increased initially， but the elevated catabolism and hypovolemia lead to weight loss (Levitsky & Misra， 2010).\n\n【77】A urinalysis and a random blood glucose can be done quickly and conveniently in the office. It is important to remember that glucosuria may suggest diabetes but is not diagnostic in and of itself. Other disorders that affect renal function， such as Fanconi syndrome， may cause glucosuria as well (Brazy， 2006). The following are criteria for a diabetes diagnosis as set forth by the American Diabetes Association (2010)：1.HbA1c 26.5% OR 2. Fasting plasma glucose 2126mg/dL OR 3. Two-hr plasma glucose ≥200mg/dL during an oral glucose tolerance test， using a glucose load of 75g of anhydrous glucose dissolved in water. Any of these three criteria must be confirmed by a repeat test for confirmation if no unequivocal hyperglycemia is present. If classic symptoms of hyperglycemia\n\n【78】or hyperglycemic crisis are present， then a random plasma glucose ≥200mg/dL is sufficient for a diagnosis (American Diabetes Association \\[ADA\\]，2010).\n\n【79】Diabetes in general is a metabolic disorder that results from defective insulin action， insulin secre-tion， or a combination of both (ADA， 2010). The hallmark of Type 1 diabetes mellitus is an absolute insulin deficiency. The autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells prohibits the insulin produc-tion. The difference between Type 1 diabetes and Type 2 is that the insulin deficiency is relative， rather than absolute， in Type 2. Insulin resistance leads to an initial increase in insulin production. Eventually， the pancreas is unable to keep up with the increased insulin requirements； hence， there is a relative insulin deficiency (Cooke & Plotnik， 2008). In many instances， people with Type 2 diabetes are over-weight because the extra weight， especially increased abdominal girth， plays a major role in insulin resistance. However， the rise of childhood obesity and adult-onset Type 1 diabetes have blurred the definitions of “juvenile diabetes” and “adult-onset”diabetes， which were used synonymously to describe Type 1 and Type 2， respectively. The clinician should be careful to refrain from making assumptions about type based on body habitus or age of presentation. It is also important to consider that both types may exist in the same person (McCulloch， 2009).\n\n【80】Diabetes mellitus must be properly typed in order to be effectively managed. After initial testing， additional laboratory assessments may be needed to aid in solidifying a diagnosis. Although the presence of serum antibodies to pancreatic islet cells， glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)， the 40K fragment of tyrosine phosphatase (IA2)， and/or insulin strongly suggests Type 1 diabetes， the absence of such antibodies does not exclude a Type 1 diagnosis (Levitsky & Misra， 2010). Measuring C-peptide is helpful since it is secreted along with insulin in a one-to-one molar ratio. Dissimilar to insulin， there is little first-pass liver clearance， but it still indicates a direct relationship to endogenous insulin secretion. C-peptide measurements under standardized conditions are an acceptable assessment of beta-cell function (Palmer et al.， 2004).\n\n【81】**What is the plan of treatment?**\n\n【82】Education is key. Glucose monitoring， ketone monitoring， insulin administration， how to operate an insulin pump， and how to recognize signs/symptoms of hypoglycemia are just a few of the instruc-tional points which usually have to be reiterated. It is crucial to also provide appropriate mental health services for the child and the family. Kara's new diagnosis requires lifestyle changes and development of coping and management strategies which affect family function， thereby placing Kara and her mother at increased risk for depression (Jaser， Whittemore， Ambrosino， Lindemann， & Grey，2008).\n\n【83】**Are any referrals needed at this time?**\n\n【84】Kara was referred from the school-based health center to a diabetes clinic that employs a multidisci-plinary approach to education and management of diabetes. In Kara’s case， it is a good idea to refer her for mental health counseling， since she is coping with her parents' separation， also. She has addi-tional medical and mental health support at school through the school-based health center， school nurse， and school psychologist. The broader the support base， the better the outcome.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

She has a history of having had a “partial hysterectomy,” by which she means that her uterus and cervix were removed but her ovaries were left in place. The surgery was performed because of fibroids. She has had a Pap smear every year since the age of 18, all of which have been normal. She has had annual mammograms since the age of 40, all of which have been normal. She has no other significant medical or surgical history. She takes a multivitamin pill daily but no other medications. Her family history is significant for breast cancer that was diagnosed in her maternal grandmother at the age of 72. The patient is married, monogamous, and does not smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol. She tries to avoid dairy products because of “lactose intolerance.” She walks 3 miles four times a week for exercise. Her physical examination is normal.\n\n【3】 For this patient, how often should a Pap smear be performed?\n\n【4】 What could you recommend to reduce her risk of developing osteoporosis?\n\n【5】 According to the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), what is the recommended interval for screening mammography?\n\n【6】### ANSWERS TO CASE 11:  \nHealth Maintenance in Adult Female\n\n【7】_Summary:_ A 50-year-old woman with a history of having had a hysterectomy for a benign indication comes to your office for a routine health maintenance visit.\n\n【8】• Interval for cervical cancer screening: Based upon her history of having a hysterectomy for benign disease and her overall low-risk status, cervical cancer screening can be discontinued in this patient.\n\n【9】• Interventions to reduce her risk of developing osteoporosis: Supplementation with at least 1200 mg calcium and 400 to 800 IU vitamin D daily; regular weight-bearing and muscle-strengthening exercise; avoidance of tobacco smoke (active or passive) and excessive alcohol intake (>3 drinks/day).\n\n【10】• USPSTF recommended interval for screening mammography in a 50-year-old woman: Biennial (every 2 years).\n\n【11】### ANALYSIS\n\n【12】#### _Objectives_\n\n【13】1\\. Discuss age-appropriate preventive health measures for adult women.\n\n【14】2\\. Review evidence in support of specific health maintenance measures.\n\n【15】#### _Considerations_\n\n【16】When evaluating patients for preventive health measures, there should not be a “one size fits all” approach to care. Some interventions are appropriate across age groups; some are age or risk-factor specific and should be tailored accordingly. Interventions to consider include screening for cardiovascular disease, breast cancer, cervical cancer, osteoporosis, and domestic violence. Other health maintenance measures, such as screening for colon cancer and routine adult immunizations are discussed in Case 1 and tobacco use is discussed in Case 7. The interventions discussed in this chapter are primarily based upon recommendations of the USPSTF; recommendations of other expert panels or advocacy organizations are included where appropriate.\n\n【17】### APPROACH TO:  \nHealth Maintenance in Women\n\n【18】### DEFINITIONS\n\n【19】BRCA: Abbreviation for genes associated with breast cancer and ovarian cancer. Mutations in the BRCA-1 or BRCA-2 genes can be associated with a three- to sevenfold increased risk for breast cancer, along with increased risks of ovarian, colorectal, and possibly other types of cancer. USPSTF recommends that women whose family history is associated with an increased risk for BRCA mutations be referred for genetic counseling and evaluation for BRCA testing (Level B recommendation). Increased risk is determined by: (1) two first-degree relatives with breast cancer, at least one diagnosed at <50 years old; (2) three first- or second-degree relatives diagnosed with breast cancer at any age; (3) breast and ovarian cancer in first- or second-degree relatives; (4) one first-degree relative with bilateral breast cancer; (5) two or more first- or second-degree relatives with ovarian cancer; and (6) history of breast cancer in a male family member.\n\n【20】WOMEN’S HEALTH INITIATIVE: An NIH (National Institutes of Health)-sponsored research program to address the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in postmenopausal women. This initiative included clinical trials of the effect of hormone therapy on the development of heart disease, fractures, and breast cancer.\n\n【21】### CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【22】#### _Cardiovascular Disease in Women_\n\n【23】Cardiovascular diseases are the number one killer of women in the United States. Many of the cardiovascular disease risk factors in women are the same as those in men: hypertension, high LDL (low-density lipoprotein)-cholesterol, tobacco use, diabetes mellitus, family history of cardiovascular disease. As such, the USPSTF screening recommendations for cardiovascular disease for women are similar to those for men . All women aged 18 and older should be screened for hypertension by the measurement of blood pressure (Level A <sup><a></a><a>1 </a></sup> recommendation). Further, all women aged 45 and older should be screened for lipid disorders (Level A recommendation). Abnormally elevated blood pressure or serum lipids should be managed appropriately.\n\n【24】An area of cardiovascular disease risk unique to women is in postmenopausal hormone replacement. Many women have taken hormone replacement therapy for relief of vasomotor symptoms (“hot flashes”) and reduction of risk of developing osteoporosis. Recent studies, most notably the Women’s Health Initiative, have shown increased rates of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in women taking either estrogen alone or combined estrogen and progesterone . These risks include an increased risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, and venous thromboembolic disease. For this reason, the use of hormone replacement therapy for the prevention of chronic conditions is not advised (Level D recommendation) and any use of hormone replacement should be of the lowest effective dose for the shortest effective time period .\n\n【25】#### _Screening for Breast Cancer_\n\n【26】Breast cancer is second to lung cancer in number of cancer-related deaths in women. There are approximately 190,000 new cases and over 40,000 deaths per year from breast cancer in the United States. The incidence increases with age; other risk factors include having the first child after the age of 30, a family history of breast cancer (particularly if in the mother or sister), personal history of breast cancer or atypical hyperplasia found on a previous breast biopsy, or a known carrier of the BRCA-1 or BRCA-2 gene.\n\n【27】The process of screening for breast cancer generally includes consideration of three modalities: the breast self examination (BSE), the clinical breast examination (CBE) performed by a health care professional, and mammography. Other modalities, including ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are available but currently they are not widely recommended for screening purposes. Upon review of the available studies, the USPSTF has determined that, at this time, there is insufficient evidence to recommend CBE (Level I <sup><a>1 </a></sup> recommendation) and recommend against teaching BSE (Level D <sup><a>1 </a></sup> recommendation). Both BSE and CBE may be associated with increased risks of false-positive results and subsequent need for biopsies while evidence is lacking that they reduce breast cancer mortality. Studies regarding both are ongoing.\n\n【28】Mammography screening every 12 to 33 months has been shown to reduce mortality from breast cancer. The benefits of routine mammographic screening increase with age , as the incidence of breast cancer is higher in older women. There is not an age cutoff to stop screening, but a discussion about continuing screening can be considered in the older woman with significant comorbid conditions that may limit her life expectancy. Part of the discussion regarding mammography also includes the risk of false-positive or false-negative (less common) results and need for additional interventions, such as breast biopsy. Most abnormalities found on mammography are not breast cancer but require further evaluation to make that determination. The USPSTF advises screening with mammography, beginning at the age of 50 for the general population, with a recommended interval of every 2 years (Level B <sup><a>1 </a></sup> recommendation). For women aged 40 to 49, biennial screening should be an individual decision and take into account patient’s values regarding the benefits and harms (Level C <sup><a>1 </a></sup> recommendation). Recommendations are also available from other organizations, including the American Cancer Society, American Academy of Family Physicians, and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), which advocate annual mammography after the age of 50. Their recommendations for women aged 40 to 49 vary, but generally advise screening every 1 to 2 years.\n\n【29】#### _Screening for Cervical Cancer_\n\n【30】Cervical cancer is the tenth leading cause of cancer death in women in the United States, with 4210 deaths in 2010. The incidence of cervical cancer has fallen dramatically since the introduction of the Pap smear as part of routine screening . Risk factors for cervical cancer include early onset of sexual intercourse, multiple sexual partners, human papilloma virus (HPV) infection with high-risk subtype of HPV (HPV viral types 16, 18, 45, 56), and tobacco use.\n\n【31】The optimal age to begin screening is unclear, but the USPSTF recommends starting at age 21 or within 3 years of the onset of sexual activity, whichever comes first (Level A recommendation). In 2009, ACOG recommended for cervical cancer screening to begin at age 21 regardless of sexual history due to the very low risk of cervical cancer in young women. While there is limited utility in screening for cervical cancer in a person who has never been sexually active, many organizations will advocate an age-based approach because of high rates of sexual activity by a certain age and because health-care providers may not always get accurate sexual histories.\n\n【32】Most cases of cervical cancer occur in women who either have not been screened in over 5 years or did not have follow-up after an abnormal Pap smear . The optimal screening interval between Pap smears is not known. Based upon the available studies, the USPSTF has not found evidence that annual screening is better at reducing morbidity and mortality from cervical cancer than screening every 3 years. The American Cancer Society recommends annual Pap smears until age 30 and then spacing out the interval to every 2 to 3 years; other groups suggest spacing out the interval after three consecutive normal Pap smears.\n\n【33】A vaccine against high-risk HPV subtypes is available. It is indicated for use in both males and females aged 9 through 26. To date, there is no recommendation to alter the Pap smear screening intervals for women who have been vaccinated against HPV.\n\n【34】The purpose of a Pap smear is to detect precancerous cervical changes or possible cases of cervical cancer early, in order to improve the odds of survival. Keeping this in mind, the USPSTF recommends against Pap smears for women who have had a hysterectomy (including removal of the cervix) for benign indications (Level D recommendation). It is prudent to ask a woman who has had a hysterectomy why the surgery was performed and to confirm (either by reviewing the operative report or on examination) the absence of the cervix. A woman who had a hysterectomy for cancerous indications falls out of the general screening parameters discussed here.\n\n【35】The optimal age to stop screening is subject to debate. The USPSTF discusses discontinuing cervical cancer screening after the age of 65 both if no new risk factors have been identified (ie, new partner) and if there has been adequate recent screening. The incidence of cervical cancer falls with age; the false-positive rate increases, thus potentially subjecting women to additional unnecessary procedures. The American Cancer Society recommends that screening may be stopped at the age of 70 if a woman has had three consecutive normal Pap smears and no abnormal Pap smears in the last 10 years.\n\n【36】#### _Screening for Osteoporosis_\n\n【37】Osteoporosis is a condition of decreased bone mineral density associated with an increased risk of fracture. Half of all postmenopausal women will have an osteoporosis-related fracture in their lifetime . These include hip fractures, which are associated with higher risks of loss of independence, institutionalization, and death. The risk of osteoporosis is increased with advancing age, tobacco use, low body weight, Caucasian or Asian ancestry, family history of osteoporosis, low calcium intake, and sedentary lifestyle.\n\n【38】Osteoporosis may also occur in men, although with a lower incidence than it does in women. Along with the risk factors noted above, the prolonged use of corticosteroids, presence of diseases that alter hormone levels (such as chronic kidney or lung disease), and undiagnosed low testosterone levels increase the risk of osteoporosis in men.\n\n【39】Screening for osteoporosis is done by measurement of bone density. Measurement of the hip bone density by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the best predictor of hip fracture. Measurement of bone density is compared to the bone density of young adults and the result is reported as standard deviation from the mean bone density of the young adult (T-score). Osteoporosis is present if the patient’s T-score is at or below −2.5 (ie, measurement of the patient’s bone density is more than 2.5 standard deviations below the young adult mean); osteopenia is present if the T-score is between −1.0 and −2.5. Other modalities, such as measurement of wrist or heel density, single-energy x-ray absorptiometry, and ultrasound are being evaluated and may have some short-term predictive value. The USPSTF recommends screening for osteoporosis via DXA in women after the age of 65 and considering screening in women aged more than 60 with higher risk of osteoporosis-related fractures (Level B recommendation).\n\n【40】Calcium and vitamin D intake have a role in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. The National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) recommends at least 1200 mg of calcium and 400 to 800 IU of vitamin D per day for all women over the age of 50 . If dietary intake is not sufficient, supplements may be used. Weight-bearing and muscle strengthening exercise is also recommended both for its direct effects on increasing bone density and for its benefits in strength, agility, and balance, which may reduce the risk of falls.\n\n【41】When osteoporosis is diagnosed, patients should be treated with calcium, vitamin D, and exercise and strategies should be implemented to reduce the risk of falls. These strategies include evaluation and treatment, if needed, of vision and hearing deficits, management of medical disorders that can promote falls (movement disorders, neurologic disorders, etc), and periodic evaluation of medications taken that may affect balance or movement. Hip protectors may be beneficial in those at high risk for falls.\n\n【42】Medications used for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis are included in Table 11–1 .\n\n【43】Table 11–1 • FDA APPROVED MEDICATIONS FOR THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF OSTEOPOROSIS\n\n【44】#### _Screening for Domestic Violence_\n\n【45】Estimates indicate that between 1 and 4 million women are sexually, physically, or emotionally abused by an intimate partner each year. Women are also much more likely to be abused by an intimate partner than men. Multiple factors are associated with intimate partner violence and include young age, low income status, pregnancy, mental illness, alcohol or substance use by victims or partner, separated or divorced status, and a history of childhood sexual/physical abuse. Multiple rating scales are available to assess for presence of domestic violence which are of variable quality. The USPSTF found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against routine screening for intimate partner abuse, or that screening affects outcomes (Level A recommendation). Other groups, including the American Academy of Family Physicians and American Medical Association, recommend awareness and advocate asking about domestic violence. Documentation and treatment of injuries, counseling, and information regarding protective services are part of the evaluation when domestic violence is suspected. Reporting of domestic violence is mandatory in several states; be aware of the requirements of your state.\n\n【46】### ", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

She drove herself to the \n\n【4】hospital and admitted that she felt dizzy while driving. The patient also gave history \n\n【5】of several such episodes in the past. At times, she was able to abort the attack by \n\n【6】splashing cold water on her face, or by applying firm pressure over the eyes. At \n\n【7】other times, she had to rush to the hospital, as on that day. During the “machine￾like” sensation over the chest, she never experienced any chest pain or difficulty in \n\n【8】breathing. However, after the palpitation stopped, she would pass a large volume \n\n【9】of urine. The onset of these episodes was unrelated to physical exercise, emotional \n\n【10】stress or to the intake of any particular food or beverage. There was no history of \n\n【11】tremor, heat-intolerance, undue fatigue or significant weight-loss.\n\n【12】On examination, the patient was apprehensive but not tachypneic. The \n\n【13】extremities were not cold but her palms were sweaty. The pulse rate was extremely \n\n【14】rapid and exceeded 150 beats/min, although it could not be counted accurately. \n\n【15】The BP was 91/64 mm Hg over the right arm and she was apyrexial. There were no \n\n【16】signs of congestive heart failure. There was no goitre, bruit over the thyroid gland or \n\n【17】any clinical sign of Grave’s disease. The precordium was normal and the apex beat \n\n【18】was normally located. There was extreme tachycardia and the character of S1\n\n【19】 and \n\n【20】S2\n\n【21】 could not be appreciated. The attending doctor performed right carotid sinus \n\n【22】massage which resulted in sudden termination of the patient’s symptoms and a \n\n【23】remarkable change in her heart rate. An ECG was obtained afterwards (Fig. 42.1).\n\n【24】 Figure 42.1: ECG showing features of the WPW Syndrome190 Section 12 Electrocardiac Syndromes\n\n【25】The P-R interval is short because ventricular depolarization through the \n\n【26】accessory pathway, bypasses the normal conduction delay at the A-V node. \n\n【27】The notch on the ascending limb of R wave is the delta wave. It indicates pre￾excitation of the ventricle through the accessory pathway, before depolarization \n\n【28】of the entire ventricle by the normal conduction system. The QRS complex is \n\n【29】wide because it is a fusion beat, which is the sum of ventricular prexcitation and \n\n【30】normal ventricular depolarization. The S-T segment and T wave inversion are \n\n【31】repolarization abnormalities, secondary to the abnormal pattern of ventricular \n\n【32】depolarization (Fig. 42.3). \n\n【33】Figure 42.2: Diagram to illustrate the Bundle of Kent\n\n【34】Figure 42.3: ECG in case of WPW syndrome\n\n【35】ECG INTERPRETATION \n\n【36】The ECG showed normal P waves with a P-R interval of 0.08 sec. The width of the \n\n【37】QRS complex was 0.12 sec with a notch on the ascending limb of the R wave. There \n\n【38】was depression of the S-T segment with inversion of the T wave. These findings \n\n【39】are consistent with the diagnosis of WPW syndrome. The Wolff-Parkinson￾White (WPW) Syndrome is a distinct electrocardiographic entity wherein an \n\n【40】accessory pathway, the bundle of Kent, directly connects the atrial myocardium \n\n【41】to the ventricular myocardium, bypassing the A-V node (Fig. 42.2). This produces \n\n【42】abnormalities of the QRS complex, P-R interval, S-T segment and the T wave. Case 42 WPW Syndrome 191\n\n【43】Three types of QRS configuration are described in the WPW syndrome, \n\n【44】depending upon the direction of the accessory pathway. \n\n【45】•\t Type A (left septal connection) produces upright QRS complexes in all the\n\n【46】precordial leads. It resembles right bundle branch block or true posterior wall \n\n【47】myocardial infarction. \n\n【48】•\t Type B (right-sided connection) has negative QRS complexes in V1\n\n【49】 and \n\n【50】positive complexes in lead V6\n\n【51】. It resembles left bundle branch block or left \n\n【52】ventricular hypertrophy. \n\n【53】•\t Type C (left lateral connection) has positive QRS complexes in lead V1 and \n\n【54】negative complexes in lead V6\n\n【55】. It resembles right ventricular hypertrophy. \n\n【56】CLINICAL DISCUSSION \n\n【57】The standardized nomenclature of pre-excitation syndromes uses the term “tract” \n\n【58】for pathways that insert into specialized conduction tissue and “connection” \n\n【59】for pathways that enter the general myocardium. The Wolff-Parkinson-White \n\n【60】(WPW) syndrome involves an atrio-ventricular connection (Kent bundle). Lown￾Ganong-Levine (LGL) syndrome involves an atrio-fascicular bypass tract (James \n\n【61】bundle) (Fig. 42.4). Mahaim fibers constitute a fasciculo-ventricular connection. \n\n【62】Figure 42.4: Diagram to illustrate the various pre-excitation syndromes \n\n【63】A: Atrium; V: Ventricle; A-V: Atrio-ventricular\n\n【64】The WPW syndrome is a masquerader of several other cardiac conditions:\n\n【65】•\t The delta wave as separate from the R wave can mimic bundle branch block.\n\n【66】•\t The dominant R wave in lead V1\n\n【67】 may resemble right ventricular hypertrophy. \n\n【68】•\t Negative delta wave with S-T segment depression and T wave inversion, may\n\n【69】appear as myocardial infarction. \n\n【70】•\t Antidromic A-V re-entrant tachycardia conducted anterogradely through the\n\n【71】accessory pathway may be mistaken for ventricular tachycardia. \n\n【72】The clinical importance of the WPW syndrome lies in the fact that it predisposes \n\n【73】to paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, since the bypass tract forms a re-entrant circuit \n\n【74】with the regular conduction pathway. Paroxysmal atrial tachycardia (PAT) in the \n\n【75】presence of WPW syndrome needs to be differentiated from a PAT without an \n\n【76】accessory pathway, since the management is somewhat different. 192 Section 12 Electrocardiac Syndromes\n\n【77】MANAGEMENT ISSUES \n\n【78】Presence of the WPW syndrome predisposes an individual to paroxysmal supra￾ventricular tachycardia (PSVT), wherein the bypass tract constitutes a re-entrant \n\n【79】circuit along with the normal conduction pathway. In almost 90% patients, \n\n【80】conduction proceeds anterogradely down the A-V node and returns retrogradely \n\n【81】through the accessory pathway to the atrium. This is known as orthodromic \n\n【82】tachycardia and here the QRS complex is narrow. This arrhythmia responds to \n\n【83】vagal manoeuvres and to drugs used in the treatment of A-V nodal re-entrant \n\n【84】tachycardia (AVNRT). These drugs include verapamil, diltiazem, digitalis and\n\n【85】adenosine. \n\n【86】In less than 10% patients, anterograde conduction proceeds down the \n\n【87】accessory pathway and returns retrogradely through the normal A-V nodal \n\n【88】pathway to the atrium. This is known as antidromic tachycardia and here the QRS \n\n【89】complex is wide and demonstrates the WPW syndrome. This arrhythmia does \n\n【90】not respond to vagal manoeuvres, but only to cardioversion with DC shock or to \n\n【91】antiarrhythmic drugs that block the accessory pathway such as amiodarone.

The ferret is housed with two other ferrets that appear healthy. Other pets in the household include two dogs and two cats. The client lives on a small farm where a small number of livestock (cattle and chickens) are kept. The ferrets are fed a commercial kibbled diet.﻿\n\n【7】Physical Examination Findings\n\n【8】A geriatric ferret was 10% dehydrated and was moderately lethargic. A small amount of watery discharge was noted from his left eye. There was also a significant amount of debris in both ears that contained a mixed yeast and bacterial infection based on cytological examination. See Figures 2.2 \\- 2.5 and Tables 2.1 and 2.2 .﻿\n\n【9】Interpretive Discussion\n\n【10】In Fig. 2.2 , the dark tarry stool is representative of melena. Figure 2.3 represents ear mites _(Otodectes)._ Figure 2.4 shows the Wright–Giemsa stained blood film, which reveals numerous echinocytes and a schis-tocyte. An erythrocyte in the center as well as a few others appears to contain a pale structure, suggestive of Heinz bodies. Figure 2.5 shows staining of the blood with a stain used to detect reticulocytes and reveals blue structures within the erythrocytes, indicative of Heinz bodies.\n\n【11】On day 1, the ferret appears to be exhibiting a stress leukogram; however, considering the geriatric status of the ferret, it is also likely that the neutrophils/ lymphocytes ratio has changed with age, resulting in decreased lymphocytes and increased neutrophils compared to younger ferrets. The ferret has a significant anemia based on the low PCV, RBC, and hemoglobin concentration. The cause of the anemia is likely in part related to blood loss in the gastrointestinal tract as indicated by melena. The refractometric plasma protein is low, which supports blood loss; however, this finding is not supported by the normal protein or perhaps elevated value found in the biochemical profile. Because the ferret appears clinically dehydrated, the anemia may actually be worse than it appears and the red cell indices and total protein values would expect to decrease with fluid replacement therapy. The anemia may also be related in part to a hemolytic anemia associated with Heinz body formation in the erythrocytes in which a moderate number of large Heinz bodies and a few small Heinz bodies were reported on the hemogram. At this time, the anemia appears to be poorly regenerative as indicated by the lack of a significant polychromasia and reticulocyte count. The platelet count is low owing to either excessive peripheral utilization of platelets associated with gastrointestinal hemorrhage or perhaps as an analytic artifact associated with clumping of platelets as indicated by the interpretation of the blood film. The presence of echinocytes is typically an artifactual finding.\n\n【12】The plasma biochemical profile on day 1 indicates a possible hyperproteinemia with a hyperglobulinemia suggestive of an immune response based on the first set of reference values but not supported by the second set of reference values.\n\n【13】The hemogram on day 6 indicates no significant change in the leukogram; however, there is a marked improvement to the erythrocyte parameters. The ferret is exhibiting a significant regenerative response to his erythrocytes, platelets, and refractometric total protein. He is no longer anemic and appears to be recovering from a blood loss anemia. The unexplained presence of Heinz bodies in this case has disappeared. Heinz bodies are caused by oxidative damage to hemoglobin. A common cause for this condition in domestic cats is inges-tion of onions or onion products. Other plants, such as garlic, _Brassica,_ and red maple _(Acer rubrum)_ leaves, may also cause Heinz body formation.

Non-visible haematuria is further classified into symptomatic \n\n【30】(with voiding LUTS) or asymptomatic (no voiding LUTS).\n\n【31】! Causes of haematuria\n\n【32】• Kidneys: neoplasia (benign, e.g. angiomyolipoma; malignant, e.g. renal cell \n\n【33】carcinoma, transitional cell carcinoma), polycystic kidneys, calculi, pyelonephritis, \n\n【34】tuberculosis, glomerulonephritis or immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy\n\n【35】• Ureter: transitional cell carcinoma or calculi\n\n【36】• Bladder: neoplasia, e.g. transitional cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, \n\n【37】calculi, inflammatory or infective causes – cystitis, schistosomiasis\n\n【38】• Prostate: prostatitis, carcinoma or benign prostatic hyperplasia\n\n【39】• Urethra: neoplasia, e.g. transitional cell carcinoma, urethritis, calculi or foreign bodies\n\n【40】• Other: anticoagulants, urinary tract instrumentation, clotting abnormalities, trauma \n\n【41】to the urinary tract, right-sided heart failure or renal vein thrombosis\n\n【42】• Rare: strenuous exercise, bacterial endocarditis or embolism\n\n【43】In this case the most likely diagnosis is a transitional carcinoma of the bladder. When taking \n\n【44】the history, it is important to elicit the following:\n\n【45】•\t Visible or non-visible: duration of haematuria\n\n【46】•\t Age: cancers are more common with increasing age\n\n【47】•\t Sex: females more likely to have urinary tract infections\n\n【48】•\t Location: during micturition, was the haematuria always present (indicative of \n\n【49】renal, ureteric or bladder pathology) or was it only present initially (suggestive of \n\n【50】anterior urethral pathology) or present at the end of the stream (posterior urethra, \n\n【51】bladder neck)?\n\n【52】•\t Pain: more often associated with infection/inflammation/calculi, whereas malig￾nancy tends to be painless\n\n【53】•\t Associated lower urinary tract symptoms that will be helpful in determining aetiology\n\n【54】•\t History of trauma\n\n【55】•\t Travel abroad, e.g. swimming in lakes is Africa and Egypt and the risks of \n\n【56】schistosomiasis\n\n【57】•\t Previous urological surgery/history/recent instrumentation/prostatic biopsy\n\n【58】•\t Medication, e.g. anticoagulants\n\n【59】•\t Family history\n\n【60】•\t Occupational history, e.g. rubber/dye occupational hazards are risk factors for \n\n【61】developing transitional carcinoma of the bladder due to exposure of chemicals such \n\n【62】as b-naphthalene\n\n【63】•\t Smoking status: increased risk, particularly of bladder cancer\n\n【64】•\t General status, e.g. weight loss, reduced appetite\n\n【65】The patient should be resuscitated with intravenous fluids and a blood crossmatch taken. \n\n【66】The INR of 2.2 is in the therapeutic range for her atrial fibrillation, but is unlikely to be \n\n【67】the sole cause of her bleeding. Anticoagulation can often unmask other pathology in the \n\n【68】urinary tract. Blood clots can cause urethral obstruction so a three-way catheter should \n\n【69】be inserted and the bladder initially washed to remove all clots. The irrigation is con￾tinued until the haematuria begins to settle. The haemoglobin should be monitored and \n\n【70】the patient transfused as necessary.

One of the cage mates was suspected to have psittacosis 2 weeks earlier; however, according to the pet store manager, the test results were negative. The cockatiels were fed a commercial pellet diet designed for their species and millet seeds. This bird was weaned from his hand-feeding formula 2 months prior to presentation. He became acutely ill during the night. According to the pet store manager, the bird appeared normal until he suddenly appeared to be \"gasping for air.\" The cockatiel had not been eating for 24 hours.\n\n【7】Fig. 61.1 . An image of the cockatiel with labored breathing.﻿\n\n【8】Physical Examination Findings\n\n【9】On arrival, the bird exhibited open-mouth breathing, kept his eyes partially closed, and although weak, managed to perch. A quick assessment of the bird's body condition was made by palpation of the keel bone, revealing a body condition score of 3/9. The cockatiel was weighed (68 g) and immediately placed inside a heated oxygen-enriched cage and remained there until it became more stable and while the history was being obtained. Approximately 2 hours later, the bird was active, showed less dyspnea, and began eating food that was provided by the pet store personnel. Droppings in the cage revealed a green color to the urinary component. The bird developed severe dyspnea immediately on removal from the oxygen-enriched environment. It was noted that the nares were occluded and the choanal slit in the mouth was reddened. The nares were opened by performing a sinus wash using physiological saline through a syringe held tightly against each nostril. A mucoid fluid was collected on a cotton-tipped applicator from the choanal slit for cytodiagnosis ( Figs. 61.2a and 61.2b ). An attempt to obtain a blood sample via jugular venipuncture for hematology and plasma AST, CK, and total protein values was abandoned because of the deteriorating condition of the bird during the brief handling to remove the material occluding the nares. A fecal sample was submitted for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for _Chlamydophila psittaci._﻿\n\n【10】Interpretive Discussion\n\n【11】Figures 61.2a and 61.2b reveal nondegenerate heterophils with a thick background that is likely associated with the mucoid nature of the material collected from the choanae. The sample was likely diluted with saline because it was collected from a wash procedure; therefore, the number of inflammatory cells may be higher than what appears on the sample. These images also reveal large spiral-shaped bacteria. The cytodiagnosis is a mild heterophilic inflammation likely associated with a spirochete infection.\n\n【12】Fig. 61.2 . (a and b) The image of the sinus wash sample (Wright–Giemsa stain, 100 x).﻿\n\n【13】Summary\n\n【14】The clinical signs of upper respiratory disease in this cockatiel exhibiting significant weight loss can be associated with a number of common infectious diseases of psittacine birds, which include chlamydophilosis (psittacosis) and aspergillosis. A blood profile would have been helpful in determining the extent of any systemic manifestation of the disease. A hemogram revealing a severe inflammatory leukogram with a marked leukocytosis, heterophilia, and monocytosis would be supportive of those two diseases. Severe inflammatory leukograms with a total leukocyte count approaching 50,000/μL or greater in psittacine birds are often associated with infections caused by _Mycobacterium, Aspergillus,and Chlamydophila._\n\n【15】A plasma biochemical profile supportive of a diagnosis of chlamydophilosis would include a hyperpro-teinemia, hyperglobulinemia, an increased plasma as-partate aminotransferase (AST) with a normal creatine kinase (CK), and increased bile acids. The presence of biliverdinuria (green urine) as identified in this patient would further support hepatobiliary disease and a presumptive diagnosis for chlamydophilosis.\n\n【16】The bird was treated for a spirochete infection with the choice of antibiotic treatment also targeting a presumptive diagnosis for an infection with _C. psittaci._ Spirochetes are difficult to culture; therefore, an antibiotic sensitivity is difficult to obtain. These organisms, however, respond to a variety of antibiotics. Therefore, an antibiotic protocol using doxycycline (2.1 mg PO BID) for 45 days and enrofloxacin (0.4 mg PO BID) for 14 days was initiated. The bird was maintained in an oxygen-enriched environment and also received 10 mg enrofloxacin per milliliter saline as a nebulization treatment for 30 minutes twice daily.\n\n【17】Spirochete infections in cockatiels are generally associated with young birds and result in an upper respiratory infection associated with excess mucus production in the choanae and trachea (Schmidt et al., 2003). Affected birds are often presented with oral lesions or an acute, mild rhinitis or sinusitis.\n\n【18】The fecal PCR testing for _C. psittaci_ in this patient was positive, indicating that the bird was actively shedding the organism. It is possible that this bird had a mixed infection with _C. psittaci_ and the spirochetes (presumed to be a _Helicobacter_ sp.). Cockatiels can be asymptomatic carriers for both agents and break with the diseases associated with them during times of stress.\n\n【19】The bird died 24 hours after presentation. The body was returned to the pet store for a necropsy to be performed by the store's pathologist.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Which of the following is true with regard to regulation of respiration?\n\n【1】> (A) Breathing is centrally regulated via the hypothalamus and amygdala\n\n【2】> (B) Central chemoreceptors affect breathing by directly detecting blood levels of hydrogen ions\n\n【3】> (C) Peripheral chemoreceptors stimulate breathing when the partial pressure of oxygen dips below 60 mm Hg\n\n【4】> (D) Stretch, irritant, and J receptors all function outside the lung to regulate breathing\n\n【5】> (E) The aortic and carotid bodies are considered central chemoreceptors\n\n【6】 **Answer**: The correct answer is C. Peripheral, not central chemoreceptors stimulate breathing in response to oxygen levels <60 mm Hg.  \n  \nAnswer A is incorrect. Central control is located in the brain stem and cerebral cortex. The most important structures include the medullary respiratory center located in the reticular formation, the apneustic center in the lower pons, the pneumotaxic center in the upper pons, and the cerebral cortex.  \n  \nAnswer B is incorrect. Central chemoreceptors do affect breathing with varying levels of hydrogen in the blood, but they do not directly detect levels of hydrogen in the blood. The hydrogen in blood cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. Thus, carbon dioxide in the blood crosses the cerebrospinal fluid and combines with water to form hydrogen and bicarbonate. The resulting hydrogen acts directly on the receptors.  \n  \nAnswer D is incorrect. Stretch, irritant, and J receptors function within the lung to regulate breathing. Stretch receptors are located in the smooth muscle; irritant receptors are located in the airway epithelial cells; and the J (juxta-capillary) receptors are located in the alveolar walls close to the capillaries.  \n  \nAnswer E is incorrect. The aortic and carotid bodies are not central chemoreceptors.

Ramipril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Other examples of \n\n【24】ACE inhibitors include enalapril, lisinopril and perindopril.\n\n【25】 The  renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis is part of the body’s homeostatic \n\n【26】mechanisms to regulate the blood pressure, ensuring adequate organ perfusion. \n\n【27】In response to a reduction in blood pressure, the enzyme renin, is secreted by the \n\n【28】renal juxtaglomerular cells. Renin cleaves angiotensinogen, an α-2-globulin pro￾duced by the liver into the peptide hormone, angiotensin I. Angiotensin I does \n\n【29】not appear to have significant physiological effects, but it is subsequently cleaved by \n\n【30】the ACE into angiotensin II.\n\n【31】 Angiotensin II acts on angiotensin type 1  receptors to induce vasoconstric￾tion and also stimulates increased production of vasopressin (anti-diuretic hor￾mone), therefore increasing the blood pressure. Angiotensin II additionally induces \n\n【32】increased secretion of the mineralocorticoid hormone, aldosterone, which acts to \n\n【33】promote sodium and water retention, thus further increasing the blood pressure; see \n\n【34】Figure 11.1. In addition to a reduction in mean arterial pressure, ACE inhibitors can \n\n【35】reduce left ventricular remodelling following myocardial infarction.\n\n【36】Angiotensinogen\n\n【37】produced by the liver\n\n【38】Angiotensinogen\n\n【39】Angiotensin￾converting\n\n【40】enzyme (ACE)\n\n【41】produced by\n\n【42】pulmonary\n\n【43】vasculature\n\n【44】Renin\n\n【45】Angiotensin I\n\n【46】Angiotensin II\n\n【47】type 2 receptors:\n\n【48】Vasodilatation\n\n【49】Angiotensin II\n\n【50】type 1 receptor\n\n【51】blockers\n\n【52】Angiotensin II\n\n【53】type 1 receptors:\n\n【54】Vasoconstriction\n\n【55】Aldosterone\n\n【56】produced by\n\n【57】adrenals\n\n【58】Angiotensin III\n\n【59】ACE\n\n【60】ACE￾inhibitors\n\n【61】Juxtaglomerular cells\n\n【62】of kidney produce\n\n【63】renin\n\n【64】Direct renin\n\n【65】inhibitors\n\n【66】Figure 11.1 The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis.31\n\n【67】Case 11: Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone Axis\n\n【68】2. ACE inhibitors are commonly used therapies in the management of hypertension \n\n【69】and heart failure but can be poorly tolerated by some patients. In  addition to its \n\n【70】role in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, ACE also breaks down the peptide, \n\n【71】bradykinin, into inactive metabolites. Bradykinin is an inflammatory mediator, and \n\n【72】reduced breakdown of bradykinin can result in bronchoconstriction (resulting in a \n\n【73】dry cough), or angioedema in some cases.\n\n【74】 Additional pharmacological targets in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis \n\n【75】include renin, and the direct renin inhibitor, aliskiren, may be used in some cases to \n\n【76】antagonise renin and reduce the production of angiotensin I.\n\n【77】 More commonly, the angiotensin II type 1 receptor is targeted by drugs, such as \n\n【78】losartan and valsartan, that competitively antagonise these receptors. Angiotensin \n\n【79】II type 1  receptor blockers (ARBs) reduce vasoconstriction and thus reduce the \n\n【80】mean arterial pressure. They  also leave the angiotensin II type 2  receptor unop￾posed, which may additionally promote vasodilatation.\n\n【81】Key Points\n\n【82】1. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis is part of the body’s homeostatic mecha￾nisms to regulate the blood pressure.\n\n【83】2.

Sleepwalking is also categorized as a NREM sleep arousal disorder， which is characterized by a mixture of both wakefulness and NREM sleep. Answer A (nightmare disorder) is defined as repeated awakenings with recollection of terrifying dreams， usually involving threats to survival， safety， or physical integrity. Answer B (restless leg syndrome) is defined as an urge to move the legs， with an uncomfortable or unpleasant sensation of the legs， for at least3 months. Answer C (narcolepsy) is defined as having episodes of an irre-pressible need to sleep or nap， with a frequency of at least three times a week for persisting at least 3 months. Answer D (sleep apnea) is a disturbance of breathing during sleep. Each of the answers A-D is present during REM.\n\n【19】35.2 B. This case is typical for sleep terrors. Sleep terrors often occur in the pres-ence of another sleep disorder—in particular， restless leg syndrome (answer E) and SDB. However， this particular disorder is categorized as an NREM sleep arousal disorder. These disorders represent a mixture of both wakeful activity and NREM behaviors.\n\n【20】35.3 C. The best treatment for night terrors with the documented presence of another sleep disorder is definitive treatment of that sleep disorder. In this case， an adenoidectomy or tonsillectomy should be considered in consulta-tion with an ear， nose， and throat specialist. Nearly all cases of sleep terrors resolve if the primary sleep disorder is addressed appropriately.

Although dependent on the patients’ baseline cardiovascular risk and cumulative dose of anthracycline received, the incidence of developing HF is 2–5% \\[ 19 , 20 \\]. This risk increases with the cumulative dose per body surface area, from 5% at 400 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> to 26% at 550 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> , but subclinical myocardial injury is present even at low cumulative doses \\[ 20 , 21 \\]. The majority of de novo HF occurs within the first year, yet late-onset HF is possible years after exposure \\[ 22 \\]. While avoidance may not be possible, careful monitoring of natriuretic peptides, serial echocardiography, and preventative strategies can decrease the risk of HF \\[ 6 \\]. Liposomal formulation of anthracyclines may limit myocardial exposure and have demonstrated a lower rate of HF in clinical trials \\[ 23 \\]. Dexrazoxane is a metal-chelating agent demonstrating cardioprotective properties by inhibiting anthracycline-mediated topoisomerase 2 interactions when administered to patients receiving anthracyclines \\[ 21 , 23 \\]. Yet this mechanism of protection is theorized to also diminish antitumor activity, producing recommendations to limit dexrazoxane to patients with metastatic cancer and further anthracycline doses that will exceed a cumulative dose of 300 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> \\[ 24 \\]. Empiric treatment with metoprolol and/or enalapril during anthracycline therapy for breast cancer did not reduce the incidence of HFrEF at 2 years, suggesting preventative treatment may not be beneficial in an undifferentiated population \\[ 25 \\]. Even with early detection and treatment with guideline-directed medical therapy for HFrEF, 45% of patients have irreversible HF \\[ 26 \\].\n\n【7】### 18.6.2 Alkylating Agents\n\n【8】Cyclophosphamide, Ifosfamide, and Mitomycin C exert antitumor effects by alkylating tumor DNA. Approximately 15–20% of patients exposed to these agents develop HF \\[ 6 \\]. The onset of HF is immediate, within the first 10 days of treatment, and is often reversible with time and treatment \\[ 27 \\].\n\n【9】### 18.6.3 Antimetabolites\n\n【10】Fluorouracil and its oral prodrug capecitabine cause ischemic cardiomyopathies with reduced ejection fraction secondary to coronary vasospasm. The incidence of new HF is approximately 5% and may be greater with IV fluorouracil than oral capecitabine \\[ 28 \\]. Additional associations include Takotsubo cardiomyopathy \\[ 29 \\].\n\n【11】### 18.6.4 Biologic Agents\n\n【12】Several biologic agents targeting tumors through epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (ErbB2), vascular endothelial growth factor A-ligand (VEGFA), and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) have been associated with increased risk of de novo HF.\n\n【13】Trastuzumab significantly increases the survival rate of women with breast cancer expressing human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) receptors, but increases the risk of de novo HF approximately threefold compared to anthracycline monotherapy \\[ 30 \\]. However, trastuzumab differs from anthracyclines in that the cardiac effects are a temporary decrease in contractility and ejection fraction in the absence of myocardial cell damage \\[ 31 \\]. Thus, the effects are reversible, with more than 80% of patients demonstrating recovery at a median of 6 months \\[ 32 \\]. Patients with existing HF were excluded from these studies, and the magnitude and reversibility of impairment in patients with established HF is unknown. The cardiac effects of trastuzumab are diminished when the administration is delayed following anthracycline therapy, which may be a strategy in some patients \\[ 21 \\]. Pertuzumab and Lapatinib exhibit effects on the same antitumor pathway and have similar concerns as Trastuzumab.\n\n【14】Tyrosine kinase inhibitors, (e.g., Sunitinib, Sorafenib, Imatinib) inhibit several different growth factor kinases responsible for tumor progression. Sunitinib’s association with de novo HF and hypertension is well established \\[ 33 \\]. Sunitinib causes HFrEF via increased afterload and direct myocyte toxicity that is incompletely understood \\[ 6 \\]. HF is less common with Sorafenib and Imatinib.\n\n【15】### 18.6.5 TNF-α Inihibitors\n\n【16】Infliximab, Etanercept, and Adalimumab are pivotal mediations in treating rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. TNF- _α_ inhibitors have been associated with both de novo HF in post-marketing surveillance and have warnings for new-onset HF in their package labeling \\[ 34 \\]. Several large randomized, controlled trials of TNF- _α_ inhibitors in patients with established HF have been conducted. Infliximab increased the risk of HF hospitalizations and death at doses of 10 mg/kg compared to lower doses of 5 mg/kg \\[ 35 \\]. Trials of etanercept in HF were terminated early due to lack of benefit and signals of harm \\[ 36 , 37 \\]. The risk of HF exacerbations may be greatest in patients older than 65 years with chronic HF treated with TNF- _α_ inhibitors \\[ 38 \\]. Because of this evidence, the American College of Rheumatology recommends TNF- _α_ inhibitors only be considered in patients with HF if there are no other reasonable treatment options \\[ 39 \\].\n\n【17】### 18.6.6 Sympathomimetic Stimulants\n\n【18】Stimulant medications include any central nervous system stimulants (e.g., amphetamine, dextroamphetamine, methylphenidate), pseudoephedrine, and illicit drugs. Excluding illicit use of stimulants which is clearly associated with cardiomyopathy (Chap. 20 ), use of prescription stimulants is associated with minor increases in heart rate and systolic blood pressure at the population level \\[ 40 \\]. Epidemiologic studies found no increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden cardiac death, or new-onset cardiomyopathy with stimulant medications \\[ 41 – 43 \\]. However, given the propensity of tachycardia to induce de novo HF, heart rate monitoring and individualized treatment decisions are warranted \\[ 8 \\]. Likewise, these medications should be avoided when possible in patients with chronic HF given the strong negative association between increased heart rate and outcomes in HFrEF.\n\n【19】### 18.6.7 Anagrelide and Cilostazol\n\n【20】In addition to decreasing platelets for the treatment of thrombocytosis disorders, anagrelide also increases cardiac output via inhibition of phosphodiesterase type-IV. Counterintuitively, this can lead to high-output heart failure in 2–3% of patients, which presents with similar signs and symptoms as other HF etiologies \\[ 44 , 45 \\]. Cilostazol is a phosphodiesterase type-III inhibitor which is contraindicated in HF of any severity \\[ 46 \\]. Although never studied in patients with HF, cilostazol is contraindicated in patients with HF according to the FDA package labeling. Cilostazol is considered potentially harmful because oral milrinone, sharing the same mechanism of action, increased the risk of death in HF, presumably due to increased ventricular arrhythmias \\[ 47 \\].\n\n【21】### 18.6.8 Bromocriptine, Pramipexole, and Ergotamine\n\n【22】Fenfluramine, dexfenfluramine, and pergolide were removed from the US market after association with valvular regurgitation leading to valvular cardiomyopathy \\[ 6 \\]. The mechanism of valvular dysfunction was secondary to serotoninergic effects via the 2B receptor on cardiac valves, which raise concern for several similar medications currently available for prescription use. Ergotamine is an ergot-derivative with serotoninergic agonism properties that is associated with irreversible valvular lesions and valvular heart failure \\[ 48 \\]. Ergotamine should be replaced by the triptan medication class to treat migraines, which has good efficacy and a better safety profile \\[ 6 \\]. Bromocriptine, like pergolide, is an ergot-derivative possessing dopamine agonism but only partial serotoninergic agonism at the 2B receptor. Although structurally dissimilar and lacking significant serotoninergic properties, pramipexole has been compared with bromocriptine for cardiovascular adverse events as both treat Parkinson’s disease. Both bromocriptine and pramipexole have been associated with an increased risk of HF is epidemiologic studies \\[ 49 – 51 \\]. Yet conclusions are not definitive due to conflicting results with other observational cohorts, small number of cases, and the association with only acute but not chronic use of pramipexole. The FDA released a safety communication in 2012 of a possible increased risk of HF with pramipexole \\[ 52 \\].\n\n【23】### 18.6.9 Hydroxychloroquine\n\n【24】Cardiotoxicity has been widely reported with both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine since the 1970s during their treatment for malaria \\[ 53 , 54 \\]. Hydroxychloroquine is now commonly used in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematous and rheumatoid arthritis. Hydroxychloroquine concentrates in the myocardium, resulting in an “acquired” lysosomal storage cardiomyopathy from accumulating within cardiac myocyte lysosomes \\[ 6 , 55 \\]. Risk factors for hydroxychloroquine cardiomyopathy are predominantly related to an increased cumulative dose, including daily dose, duration of use, and older age. Although cases exist of early HF, the mean duration of hydroxychloroquine exposure is approximately 10 years before symptom onset \\[ 6 , 54 \\]. Hydroxychloroquine can cause either a dilated or restrictive cardiomyopathy, often complicated by atrioventricular block or bundle branch blocks. Endomyocardial biopsy can aid a definitive diagnosis. Congruent with the hypothesized cardiotoxic mechanism, histology is notable for vacuolated cells and the presence of curvilinear bodies, indicative of myocyte infiltration \\[ 6 , 54 \\]. Although prognoses range widely, reversal of symptoms has been reported following hydroxychloroquine discontinuation \\[ 55 \\].\n\n【25】18.7 Prescription Medications That May Exacerbate Chronic HF\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【26】Prescription medications with the potential to exacerbate underlying HF are listed in Table 18.3 . These medications have not demonstrated the ability to cause de novo HF, but can worsen chronic HF through a variety of mechanisms. Careful attention should be paid to the mechanism of exacerbation when known, as the mechanism may not worsen all types of HF. For example, medications with negative inotropy can significantly worsen HFrEF but are typically well tolerated in HFpEF where systolic function is preserved. Similarly, circumstances may exist where the potential benefit for another disease state outweighs the potential risk of HF for a given mechanism.\n", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

He had met the criteria of sterile urethritis for (1) he had KD; (2) he did not cry when urinating; test urine revealed significantly increased WBC, without/or little RBC, without positive bacteria growth in cultural test. Therefore, special antibiotics were not needed. He recovered after IVIG. Different diagnosis of sepsis should be considered.\n\n【7】### 15.1.5 Case Specific Clinical Features\n\n【8】1.  1.\n    \n    Less than one year old, male, CRP>100, WBC>15 × 10 9 /L, and hypoalbuminemia were high risk factors for developing CAA. Fortunately, this patient was treated timely, and the condition rapidly evolved favorably with IVIG and he did not have coronary artery lesion.\n    \n2.  2.\n    \n    Elevated NT-pro BNP in KD are usually caused by two possibilities: increased pressure of atrium/ventricular or encephalocoele. The later usually occurred with sterile meningitis. Thus, once NT-pro BNP increased, routine EEG check is followed. This boy had no neck stiffness; therefore, the first choice of examination should be a non-invasive EEG. On the day of admission, because the sedative effect was not very well, EEG was not performed. On the following day, his fever subsided and the mental state improved. He ate and played normally. His clinic-laboratory responses were excellent, too. EEG, head CT, and MR were not performed.\n    \n3.  3.\n    \n    D-dimer and FDP elevation usually indicates tissue disintegration in multiple organs, as evidenced by the involvement of the lungs, liver, blood, and urinary system. Lucky enough all were recovered quickly in this patient. As a common phenomenon often seen in clinical practice, hepatomegaly usually retested when the patient’s liver was enlarged bigger than at admission.\n    \n4.  4.\n    \n    In the USA, KD after vaccination most happens with Pediarix \\[DTaP, hep B, and intramuscular injection of polio vaccine (IPV) combined\\] but did not show an increase of KD \\[ 1 – 2 \\] though there is a different opinion \\[ 3 \\]. IPV was first produced by Dr. Jonas Salk for intramuscular injection in 1953. In 1960s, Dr. Albert Sabin produced attenuated live vaccine, also Sabin vaccination. It was designed for oral polio vaccine (OPV), though there was literature reporting that OPV could result in acute disseminated encephalomyelitis \\[ 4 \\]. OPV was popular in China as sugared pills, it should be taken orally three times a day. The disadvantage of OPV is that it will result in diarrhea in a person with innate immune deficiency disease. Cooling reserves are important to keep its effect. This boy had taken a sugared pill one month ago without any adverse effects reported. This time he was vaccinated via IPV. KD mostly occurs in persons with allergies. It may be easier to trigger allergic reaction when using IPV for vaccination, thus cause recipients developing KD. Fortunately, his prognosis was good.\n    \n5.  5.\n    \n    KD in infants usually are atypical. This boy developed KD step by step as classic cases stated in textbooks. Skin around BCG scar was red, similar to those happening in most babies. Of course, there was the center skin red, too. It can be recovered in 2 weeks without administrating anti-tuberculosis reagents \\[ 5 \\]. BCG scar redden is more important in KD diagnosis \\[ 6 – 8 \\]. It usually happens between days 31 and 806 after BCG inoculated \\[ 9 \\]. Some KD developed paronychia appearance at recovery phase (Fig. 15.11 ). After desquamation, some KD patients have nails with knife cut/insect cut cross furrow (Fig. 15.12a ) around 2 month of illness. At 3–4 months, the distal nail may be broken or fall off (Fig. 15.12b ). The border of peeling skin around anus in KD is clear (Fig. 15.13a ), whereas it is blurry in patients with streptococcal infection (Fig. 15.13b ). Regarding to the cracked lips, most recovered, and few developed fatty streaks around lips (Fig. 15.14a–b ). This may last forever. Treatment with ointment erythromycin may be beneficial for this.\n    \n6.  6.\n    \n    As to when they can be re-vaccinated, AHA suggests that measles, mumps, and varicella immunizations should be deferred for 11 months after receiving high dose IVIG \\[ 10 \\]. But children with high risk of exposure to measles may receive vaccination earlier and then be re-immunized at least 11 months after IVIG administration, if they have an inadequate serological response.\n\n【9】Fig. 15.11\n\n【10】Another KD girl was with paronychia appearance at two months of illness\n\n【11】Fig. 15.12\n\n【12】Another KD boy, after desquamation, their nails with knife cut/insect cut cross furrow at about 1.5 months of illness ( a ) and his toenails broken at about 2 months of illness, the distal nail fall off ( b )\n\n【13】Fig. 15.13\n\n【14】Another KD girl, the border of peeling skin around anus was clearly ( a ), while a streptococcal infection girl the border was blurry ( b )\n\n【15】Fig. 15.14\n\n【16】Another KD girl with lips crack, left fatty streaks around lips at two months ( a ) and two years ( b ) of illness\n\n【17】", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The differential diagnosis of a genital ulcer in a sexually active patient should include primary syphilis (though these ulcers are usually painless), genital herpes, and chancroid. Because the Tzanck smear (which looks for multinucleated giant cells typical of herpes infection), is negative, as is the VDRL test for syphilis, chancroid becomes most likely. Chancroid is a bacterial infection caused by _Haemophilus ducreyi_ , which presents typically as a painful genital ulcer with associated inguinal lymphadenopathy. It is typically treated with ceftriaxone given as a onetime, 250-mg, intramuscular injection, or with azithromycin as a single 1000-mg dose.  \n  \nAnswer A is incorrect. Acyclovir is an antiviral agent used to treat herpes infections. It is activated by viral thymidine kinase, whereupon it inhibits the herpes viral polymerase. It can be used to treat herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, varicella-zoster virus, and Epstein-Barr virus infections.  \n  \nAnswer C is incorrect. Foscarnet inhibits viral DNA polymerase without the need of activation by thymidine kinase. It is used to treat cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis, but it can also be used to treat acyclovir-resistant herpes simplex virus.  \n  \nAnswer D is incorrect. Ribavirin is used to treat respiratory syncytial virus. It functions by inhibiting inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, thus blocking the synthesis of guanine nucleotides.  \n  \nAnswer E is incorrect. Vancomycin is a bactericidal antibiotic used for multidrug-resistant gram-positive organisms such as _Staphylococcus aureus_ and _Clostridium difficile_ .

The vertebral bodies demonstrate normal alignment in the \n\n【23】AP view with normal vertebral body height preserved throughout. There is an abnormal￾ity centred on the right L4 pedicle with expansion of the cortex and dense sclerosis. The \n\n【24】adjacent transverse process also appears expanded compared to the contralateral side but \n\n【25】there is no evidence of periosteal reaction. The psoas muscle shadow is preserved, making \n\n【26】psoas abscess unlikely and there is no evidence of a large soft tissue component. There \n\n【27】is no evidence of fracture but a mild scoliosis is demonstrated at this level concave to \n\n【28】the right.\n\n【29】The differential for these appearances in a young caucasian man includes:\n\n【30】• osteoid osteoma;\n\n【31】• osteoblastoma;\n\n【32】• healing fracture;\n\n【33】• sclerosing osteomyelitis (e.g. tuberculosis, syphilis);\n\n【34】• Brodie’s abscess;\n\n【35】• osteoblastic metastasis;\n\n【36】• lymphoma;\n\n【37】• primary bone tumour (e.g. osteosarcoma).\n\n【38】Further radiological imaging is recommended and a choice needs to be made as to which \n\n【39】modality will provide the best diagnostic yield with minimal inconvenience and radia￾tion dose to this young patient. Considering the likely osseous location of the lesion, a \n\n【40】computed tomography (CT) scan would have superior resolution compared to magnetic \n\n【41】resonance imaging (MRI). Bone scintigraphy would also be beneficial but not as the first￾line imaging modality following a plain film radiograph.\n\n【42】Figure 10.2 is a single axial slice of an unenhanced CT scan acquired at the level of the \n\n【43】L4 vertebral body viewed with bone windows. Within the right pedicle there is a well￾defined 17 mm lesion (arrow) that has a narrow zone of transition and is predominantly \n\n【44】lytic in nature with some central calcification. There is diffuse sclerosis and expansion \n\n【45】of the adjacent lamina and transverse process, with no evidence of periosteal reaction, \n\n【46】spinal canal encroachment or pathological fracture. No soft tissue component is demon￾strated.

She reports having normal periods since menar-che at age 12. She denies sexual activity， thyroid symptoms， or a milky breast discharge. She has no medical problems and is not taking any medications. On examination， she is thin but otherwise normally developed. The patient makes several comments about the fact that she thinks she is fat and is not satisfied with her body image. In comparison to other patients of her age， she is extremely underweight. She reports exercising excessively to “lose weight. The remainder of the examination is normal except for a slow heart rate and dry skin with lanugo. A pregnancy test is negative， and thyroid function tests are normal.

It is often helpful to remember the various levels where normal function may be lost. If there is a history of cervical surgery， cervical stenosis may be present， resulting in an anatomic obstruction of menses. Ovarian problems also result in amenorrhea and menstrual irregularities. Possible causes of ovarian dysfunction include premature ovarian failure， a history of chemotherapy and/or radiation causing destruction of ovarian tissue， and polycystic ovarian syndrome. Finally， if there is a problem with the hypothalamic axis， FSH and LH may not be secreted， and therefore the ovaryyVwill not be stimulated to produce estrogen/progesterone. Patients with hypothyroidism， hyperprolactinemia， anorexia， excessive stress， and excessive exercise all may have hypothalamic dysfunction that affects stimulation of their ovaries. A primary ovarian prob-lem can be differentiated from a primary hypothalamic problem by checking the FSH level. If the FSH level is high， the ovary is where the problem is， and if the FSH is low， the hypothalamus is likely to be the source of the problem. If an FSH level were drawn on this patient with anorexia， it probably would be low.

They produce the oocytes and the hormones responsible for the events that lead to fertilization and the establishment of pregnancy. Ovaries are composed of two areas： a central zone， or medulla， and a periph-eral zone， or cortex. The medulla contains the ovarian support structures， including the blood，lymph vessels， and nerve fibers. The cortex contains the two functional ovarian structures， follicles and corpora lutea， in varying states of development or regression. Most follicles exist in a nondeveloping pool and are called primordial follicles. A number of primordial follicles begin development， but usually only one develops into the ovulatory (graafian) follicle. Follicles that fail to continue to develop undergo self-destruction and are referred to as atretic. Developing follicles may be classified as primary， secondary， tertiary， and graafian as they mature. Tertiary (those which con-tain a fluid-filled cavity) and larger follicles have two primary cell types sep-arated by a basement membrane. Granulosa cells surround the maturing oocyte and the fluid-filled cavity of the follicle. The basement membrane sur-rounds the granulosa cells and separates them from several outer layers of cells called thecal cells. Both granulosa and thecal cells contribute to the syn-thesis of estradiol. Androgens are synthesized by the thecal cells， cross the membrane and are converted to estradiol by the granulosa cells. After ovu-lation， the granulosa cells are transformed in a process called luteinization into the luteal cells of the corpus luteum， which is responsible for the synthesis of**\n\n【24】**progesterone. If fertilization fails to occur， the corpus luteum undergoes self-destruction in a process called luteolysis. Corpora luteal structures in their early stages of development and late stages of regression are referred to as cor-pus hemorrhagicum and corpus albicans， respectively.**\n\n【25】**Control of Ovarian Function**\n\n【26】**Ovarian function is regulated primarily by FSH and LH secreted by the ante-rior pituitary. Their secretion is regulated by the GnRH produced by the hypo-thalamic area of the brain. The hypothalamus integrates numerous positive and negative signals that affect reproductive function. The integrated message is a pulsatile secretion of GnRH at a pulse frequency to facilitate the secretion of FSH and/or LH. GnRH pulses occur at hourly to less frequent intervals. Peripheral levels of estrogen and progesterone act (feedback) at the level of the hypothalamus and/or pituitary to influence FSH and LH (pulse frequency) secretion positively and/or negatively.**\n\n【27】Follicular development is regulated by the peripheral levels of FSH and LH and/or LH pulse frequencies， depending on the state of follicle development. Transformation of primordial follicles into a cohort of developing primary follicles is independent of FSH and LH support. Several of the primary fol-licles continue to develop into tertiary follicles and then are recruited for fur-ther development by elevated levels of FSH during the first week of the menstrual cycle. A follicle at this state then is selected as the dominant folli-cle for further development and ovulation. The exact nature of dominant folli-cle selection is unknown， but hourly pulses of LH are important for further development of the dominant follicle. Elevated peripheral levels of estradiol from the developing dominant follicle suppress peripheral FSH (negative feed-back) levels and ultimately stimulate (positive feedback) the preovulatory surge of LH to ovulate the mature graafian follicle.\n\n【28】**Luteinization of the granulosa cells of the ovulated follicle to form the corpus luteum is dependent on the preovulatory surge of LH. LH also is required for maintenance of the corpus luteum with the resulting proges-terone and a low-level estrogen secretion during the luteal phase of the cycle. The resulting elevated peripheral progesterone levels reduce the frequency of LH pulses from hourly to once every 3 to 4 hours (negative feedback). In the absence of implantation of a fertilized oocyte， the corpus luteum has an inherent life span of 14 days. Mechanisms involved in luteolysis of the human corpus luteum are not fully understood， but may involve intraovarian prostaglandin F28°**\n\n【29】**Menstrual Cycle Regulation**\n\n【30】**Most of the ovarian activities described above occur over a period of 28 days(Figure 41-1). This period in humans is called the menstrual cycle because it involves vaginal shedding of the uterine mucosa： menstruation. The first day**\n\n【31】Figure 41-1. Relative peripheral pituitary and ovarian hormones levels during the menstrual cycle. The preovulatory surge of luteinizing hormone (LH) occurs on day 15. LH pulses are not shown. LH pulses occur hourly during the late follicular phase of the cycle and every 3 to 4 hours during the luteal phase.\n\n【32】**of menstruation is designated as day 1 of the menstrual cycle. Ovulation of the graafian follicle occurs around midcycle after the preovulatory LH peak. The 14 days preceding ovulation are characterized by increasing periph-eral levels of estradiol from follicular development and are called the follicu-lar phase. The 14 days after ovulation are characterized by a transitory increase in peripheral progesterone and to a lesser extent estrogen levels from**\n\n【33】**the corpus luteum and are called the luteal phase. There is greater variability in the duration of the follicular phase than the luteal phase， accounting for the considerable variation in the length of the menstrual cycle in humans. Undoubtedly， factors affecting follicular development contribute to the varia-tion in length of the follicular phase. At the uterine level， the follicular phase is referred to as the proliferative phase. During this period of estradiol influ-ence， the uterine endometrium increases in thickness and the uterine glands lengthen. During the luteal phase， when progesterone levels are elevated， the uterine glands are coiled and secretory. The phase with respect to the endometrium is called secretory. When the corpus luteum regresses and prog-esterone levels decline， the endometrial mucosa thins and is shed. This thin-ning is accompanied by necrosis of endometrial blood vessels， leading to spotty hemorrhages and contributing to the menstrual flow.**\n", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Pathogenesis of scalp dysesthesia is not fully described. However, it has reported that symptoms can be exacerbated by psychological or physical stress; may be manifestations of an underlying psychiatric disorder; or may represent a type of chronic pain syndrome \\[ 1 \\]. Scalp dysesthesia is more commonly described in patients with cervical spine abnormalities \\[ 1 \\]. The condition more commonly affects women compared to men \\[ 3 \\]. The signs of scalp dysesthesia are a consequences of repeated rubbing and scratching ( trichoteiromania ) \\[ 2 \\]. The vertex area is most commonly affected \\[ 2 \\]. The diagnosis of scalp dysesthesia is mainly established based on clinical picture. Trichoscopy can be helpful to confirm diagnosis. Characteristic trichoscopic markers of scalp dysesthesia are uniform in length broom hairs, block hairs and short hairs with trichorrhexis nodosa \\[ 2 \\]. Topical corticosteroids and oral antihistamines are most commonly used for scalp dysesthesia treatment. Pregabalin, gabapentin and low-dose antidepressants may be effective \\[ 1 , 3 \\].\n\n【27】In the presented case, tinea capitis, trichotillomania and lichen planopilaris were included into differential diagnosis.\n\n【28】Lichen planopilaris presents as cicatricial alopecia with the presence of perifollicular erythema and follicular hyperkeratosis and the periphery. It predominantly affects the vertex or parietal areas of the scalp \\[ 3 \\]. The disease is mostly diagnosed in women between 40 and 60 years of age.\n\n【29】Tinea capitis is a cutaneous fungal infection or dermatophytosis of the scalp \\[ 4 \\]. It is the most commonly observed in children between three and seven years of age \\[ 5 \\]. Clinically, it presents as hair loss areas with coexisted scaling, inflammation or pustules \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【30】Trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder) is defined as hair loss from a patient’s repetitive self-pulling of hair \\[ 7 \\]. Clinically, it presents as non-scarring hair loss area with the presence of different length hair. The parietal area is most commonly affected. Trichotillomania beyond the scalp may also involve eyebrows, eyelashes, and pubic hairs \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【31】The patient was diagnosed with scalp dysesthesia. Treatment with topical mometasone furoate once a day was initiated.\n\n【32】Key Points\n\n【33】*   Scalp dysesthesia is characterized by abnormal sensations of the scalp (such as burning, stinging or itching).\n    \n*   The dermatologic signs of scalp dysesthesia are a consequences of repeated rubbing and scratching (trichoteiromania).\n", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

A component of guilt is involved because the patient came to the United States to earn money to help his mother but could not fulfill this obligation because he gambled away the money. There is no physiologic or anatomic explanation for his blindness， and the patient seems to be unconcerned about it， displaying la belle _indifference._\n\n【18】**APPROACHTO：**\n\n【19】**DEFINITION**\n\n【20】**LA BELLE INDIFFERENCE： Inappropriate lack of concern about one's disability.**\n\n【21】_Diagnosis and Clinical Presentation_\n\n【22】Ensuring that the symptoms are not explained by an underlying medical or neu-rologic condition is very important when considering a diagnosis of conversion disorder (otherwise known as functional neurologic symptom disorder). It is not unheard of for this disorder to be misdiagnosed in patients who are later found to have multiple sclerosis， for example. However， it is not always a case of either/or. As listed in the diagnostic criteria， the symptom or deficit must be incompatible with a recognized neurologic or medical condition. It is not uncommon for indi-viduals with underlying neurologic diseases to also develop conversion symptoms that do not conform to anatomic or physiologic parameters. For example， a patient with a diagnosed seizure disorder can display additional seizure-like movements(the so-called pseudoseizures or psychogenic nonepileptic seizures \\[PNES\\]) with-out corresponding epileptic discharges appearing on an electroencephalogram. In such cases， conversion symptoms occurring in addition to an established illness may function as a mode of communication that expresses unconscious conflict. See Table 27-1 for diagnostic criteria.\n\n【23】_Differential Diagnosis_\n\n【24】The main diagnoses in the differential include somatic symptom disorder， illness anxiety disorder (hypochondriasis)， factitious disorder， and malingering. Somatic symptom disorder is a chronic disorder that includes multiple physical symptoms that are distressing or result in significant disruption in functioning. Illness anxiety disorder (hypochondriasis) is a chronic preoccupation with having or acquiring a serious illness， coupled with anxiety about health and performing excessive health-related behaviors. Factitious disorders involve the intentional production or falsi-fication of physical or psychological signs or symptoms in order to present as ill or impaired (assume the sick role). Malingering is not a mental illness but involves the intentional production or exaggeration of symptoms motivated by external incen-tives (eg， obtaining financial compensation or avoiding a jail sentence， military duty， or work). There is often misunderstanding about the differences among conversion disorder， factitious disorder， and malingering. In the first， there is an unconscious or unintentional production of symptoms because of conflicts or stressors， whereas in the latter two， there is a conscious or intentional production of symptoms.\n\n【25】| Table 27-1·DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR CONVERSION DISORDER  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| (FUNCTIONALNEUROLOGIC SYMPTOM DISORDER)  |\n| One or more symptoms of altered voluntary motor or sensory function.Evidence of incompatibility between the symptoms and recognized neurologic or medical conditions. The symptom or deficit is not better explained by another medical or mental disorder.The symptom or deficit causes significant distress or impairment in functioning or warrantsmedical evaluation.  |\n\n【26】**_Treatment_**\n\n【27】In most cases， conversion symptoms resolve on their own， without treatment. However， it is not at all unusual for the same or similar problems to recur， especially in the presence of a new stressor or conflict. Patients with conversion disorder tend to be responsive to suggestion. Reassurance coupled with education regarding their illness can often quickly result in resolution of the symptom(s). This may include a comment such as， “Under stress， the body can react in unusual ways； this will likely get better soon on its own. It is essential not to imply that patients are exaggerat-ing， faking， or consciously producing their symptoms or that their problems are\"all in their heads. This approach only tends to alienate the patient， create more stress， and possibly worsen the deficit. CBT and/or PT have also been shown to be helpful in conversion disorder and may be employed in those patients where reas-surance and education do not result in remission of symptoms. Hospitalization for conversion disorder is usually not necessary， except in cases where the disability is so severe as to preclude the activities of daily living. In such cases， the patient is usually discharged within several days， after symptoms have resolved.\n\n【28】**CASE CORRELATION**\n\n【29】_●_ See also Case 16 (Panic Disorder Versus Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder) and Case 30 (Factitious Disorder).\n", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

His lack of sputum production， hypoxia， and elevated LDH level are suggestive of PJP. The protracted course makes Streptococcus pneumoniae， Mycoplasma， or influenza infection less likely. Mycobacterium tuberculosis can present with atypical radiologic features in severely immunocompromised patients. Other mycobacteria， like Mycobacterium _avium-intracellulare complex (MAC)； certain fungi， such as Cryptococcus neofor-mans， Coccidioides immitis， or Aspergillus species； and Nocardia species； and Kaposi_ sarcoma are only a few examples of a broad differential diagnosis for the patient with AIDS and pulmonary infiltrates. The presence of oral thrush strongly sug-gests a CD4 count less than 200 cells/mm； however， oral candidiasis can be pres-ent regardless of CD4 count. If laboratory findings reveal a CD4 count lower than200 cells/mm’， then PJP seems the most likely explanation for his symptoms and chest x-ray findings. Obtaining an ABG measurement will provide additional infor-mation about prognosis and guide therapy to determine the utility of corticoste-roid administration. Arterial oxygen concentration less than 70 mm Hg on room air or alveolar-arterial gradient (A-a gradient) greater than or equal to 35 mm Hg suggests more severe disease.

As levels decline to fewer than 500 cells/mm’， immune function decreases， and patients become increasingly more susceptible to opportunistic infections and/or malignancies.**\n\n【16】**As many as 40% of patients at the time of initial HIV infection will develop an acute HIV syndrome characterized by sudden onset of a mononucleosis-like illness**\n\n【17】**with fever， headaches， nontender lymphadenopathy， pharyngitis， myalgias， diar-rhea， weight loss， and sometimes a macular rash. The most common symptoms are fever， myalgias， and generalized fatigue. The rest of the patients remain asymptom-atic and have a clinically latent period of 8 to 10 years， on average， before the clinical manifestations of immunocompromise appear. As CD4 levels decline， the risk of contracting opportunistic infections or reactivation of dormant illnesses increases.**\n\n【18】**At CD4 levels less than 500 cells/mm’， patients are susceptible to infections， such as recurrent pneumonias， tuberculosis (TB)， vaginal candidiasis， and herpes zoster.**\n\n【19】**At CD4 levels less than 200 cells/mm’， patients are diagnosed with AIDS and are considered significantly immunocompromised. Patients with AIDS can easily contract infections by organisms that rarely cause significant illness in immuno-competent hosts， such as PJP， toxoplasmosis， cryptococcosis， histoplasmosis， and cryptosporidiosis.**\n\n【20】**At CD4 levels less than 50 cells/mm’， patients are severely immunocompro-mised and are susceptible to disseminated infection with MAC， cytomegalovirus(CMV) retinitis， colitis， and esophagitis and malignancies such as primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma. The Centers for Disease Control and Preven-tion has published a list of AIDS-defining conditions， which are clinical conditions that define progression from HIV to AIDS (Table 46-1).****A more indolent or chronic history of cough (productive or nonproductive) with weight loss and/or persistent night sweats， especially in high-risk patients(ie， recent exposures， previous incarceration， homelessness or association with shelters， recent emigrant from highly endemic countries， or health care workers)， should raise the question of TB. In patients with CD4 count more than 200 cells/mm’， the radiographic appearance of TB is likely to be similar to that of immuno-competent hosts. However， in those with CD4 count lower than 200 cells/mm3，the radiographic appearance is extremely variable； this population often presents with noncavitary pulmonary lesions，lymphadenopathy，and more diffuse presentation of TB (miliary or cutaneous findings). Patients with suspected pulmonary TB should be placed in respiratory isolation until their airborne infectiveness is ruled out. A negative purified protein derivative (tuberculin skin test) or interferon-gamma release assay does not rule out TB in immunocompromised hosts， as they might not be able to mount an immunologic response.

In HIV patients， Mycobacterium kansasii also causes pulmonary disease and radiographic findings identical to those of M. tuberculosis.**\n\n【23】**Several other opportunistic infections in AIDS deserve mention. Cerebral toxo-plasmosis is the most common central nervous system (CNS) space-occupying lesion in AIDS patients presenting with headache， seizures， or focal neurologic deficits. Con-trasted computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans reveal multiple ring-enhancing lesions， often located in the basal ganglia. Presump-tive diagnosis often is made based on the radiologic appearance， supported by sero-logic evidence of infection. Treatment consists of 2 weeks of empiric toxoplasmosis therapy with sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine； the most likely alternative diagnosis is CNS lymphoma. CNS lymphoma usually presents with a single mass lesion but is suspected when presumed lesions of toxoplasmosis do not regress after 2 weeks of specific therapy. If this is the case， historically， the next diagnostic step has been****At very low CD4 counts (< 50 cells/mm’)， patients with AIDS are also sus-ceptible to CMV infections. This can manifest as viremia with persistent fever， abdominal pain， diarrhea， and other symptoms， including retinitis， which can lead to blindness， esophagitis with severe odynophagia； colitis， and necrotizing adrenal-itis， occasionally leading to adrenal insufficiency. Therapy for severe CMV infec-tions includes intravenous ganciclovir， valganciclovir， cidofovir， or foscarnet.**\n\n【24】**One of the most frequent opportunistic infections occurring in patients with very low CD4 counts (< 50 cells/mm’) is MAC. The most frequent presentations include disseminated infection with persistent constitutional symptoms such as fevers， weight loss， lymphadenopathy， and gastrointestinal symptoms， such as abdominal pain or chronic watery diarrhea. Diagnosis requires a mycobacterial blood culture， which can take up to 10 days for positive results； respiratory or stool cultures have significantly lower sensitivity and specificity. Treatment involves com-bination therapy， usually beginning with a macrolide (azithromycin or clarithro-mycin) and ethambutol. The decision to include rifabutin depends on whether the patient is currently doing well on antiretroviral therapy or has a more severe infec-tion. Either way， therapy is continued for a minimum of 12 months.****weight loss. As many as 5% to 10% of patients are asymptomatic. In addition， the radiographic presentation can be highly variable， ranging from a near-normal chest film to diffuse bilateral interstitial lung opacities. Lung opacities can progress to severe alveolar lung infiltrates， acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) type. Additionally， lung cysts and pleural effusions are occasionally seen. Lung cysts can rupture， causing spontaneous pneumothorax. Suspect PJP in patients presenting with subacute onset of fever， dyspnea， nonproductive cough， and HIV/AIDS with-out PJP prophylaxis.**\n\n【25】**Laboratory Findings. Definitive diagnosis can be established by use of Giemsa， direct fluorescence antibody， silver stain， or polymerase chain reaction of sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage. Sputum induction using aerosolized hypertonic saline increases sensitivity. Elevated serum LDH levels may be used as an indirect marker for PJP， although it is nonspecific and may also be elevated in disseminated histo-plasmosis or lymphoma. Increasing LDH in the setting of therapy predicts poor prognosis. However， an LDH level less than 220 IU/L is a negative predictor of having PJP. Similarly， in patients with a CD4 count greater than 250 cells/mm²or those currently taking PJP prophylaxis with TMP-SMX， the diagnosis of PJP should be considered highly unlikely.**\n\n【26】**Determining the oxygenation levels of patients with PJP via ABG significantly affects prognosis and therapy. Patients with arterial PO， less than 70 mm Hg or A-a gradient more than 35 mm Hg have significant disease and benefit from the simultaneous use of corticosteroids and antimicrobial therapy.****HAART includes a combination of at least three drugs， often consisting of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) along with either a nonnucleo-side reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)，protease inhibitor， or integrase inhib-itor. HAART is very potent and has dramatically revolutionized the treatment of HIV， producing suppression of viral replication and allowing a patient’s CD4 count to recover. Initiation of HAART is usually indicated for all HIV-infected patients at their diagnosis， regardless of being asymptomatic or current immune status.**\n\n【27】**However， initiation of HAART is not always possible in acutely ill patients because the medications often cause side effects that can be confused with the underlying disease process. Additionally， within 1 to 2 months of starting HAART， worsening of clinical symptoms can occur despite increasing CD4 count， termed immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)， as a result of newly awak-ened host responses. Therefore， it may be preferable to initiate antiretroviral ther-apy within 2 weeks of presentation， while consulting an infectious disease expert and establishing reliable follow-up. Guidelines indicate that HAART should be restarted in all AIDS patients within 2 weeks except in cases of cryptococcal men-ingitis， which requires a delay.****declines. With CD4 counts less than 200 cells/mm’ and a detectable viral load， PJP prophylaxis with either daily or three times a week TMP-SMX is recom-mended. When CD4 counts fall under 100 cells/mm’ and patients have a posi-tive Toxoplasma serology， toxoplasmosis should be prevented with daily dosing of TMP-SMX. If CD4 levels are less than 50 cells/mm ， a MAC prophylactic regimen with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily or azithromycin 1200 mg weekly should be started； the current guidelines do not recommend prophylaxis against MAC if the patients take HAART.****_●_ See also Case 15 (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease)， Case 16(Chronic Cough/Asthma)， Case 18 (Hemoptysis/Lung Cancer)， Case 19(Community-Acquired Pneumonia)， Case 44 (Tuberculosis (Pulmonary)， Cavitary Lung Lesions)， and Case 45 (Syphilis).**\n", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

She has been suffering from intermittent colicky abdomi￾nal pain for several years with no clear exacerbating or relieving factors.

There are dilated loops of large \n\n【23】bowel extending from the caecum round to the sigmoid colon with maximal bowel diam￾eter of 7cm. The small bowel is decompressed and there is a paucity of gas within the \n\n【24】rectum. Centrally, there is an isolated loop of grossly dilated large bowel that assumes an \n\n【25】oval configuration centred on a linear density in the left lower quadrant. This is the char￾acteristic ‘coffee-bean’ sign of sigmoid volvulus. There is no evidence of intra-abdominal \n\n【26】free gas to suggest bowel perforation (Figure 99.2).\n\n【27】Figure 99.2 Abdominal radiograph indicating mesenteric axis and \n\n【28】volvulus.\n\n【29】Volvulus is defined as twisting of the intestinal tract around a mesenteric axis. It is \n\n【30】relatively rare but most commonly seen within the colon where it accounts for one in \n\n【31】ten causes of large bowel obstruction. The mid- and hindgut is associated with a fold of \n\n【32】fibro-fatty tissue called the mesentery, which provides mechanical support and carries \n\n【33】nerves, blood vessels and lymphatics to the bowel. Anchored to the back of the abdominal \n\n【34】wall, those loops of bowel that lie furthest from the mesenteric root are more mobile and \n\n【35】can be susceptible to rotation. In the large bowel, the caecum and sigmoid colon are the \n\n【36】Black line around sigmoid volvulus\n\n【37】Indicates mesenteric axis301\n\n【38】commonest sites of involvement, with predisposing factors including an unusually long \n\n【39】mesentery or chronic constipation.\n\n【40】Rotating around a mesenteric axis, the bowel twists and closes the lumen, causing bowel \n\n【41】obstruction. This can resolve spontaneously in response to peristalsis, with patients com￾plaining of intermittent resolving abdominal pain. Failure to untwist the bowel will cause \n\n【42】bowel dilatation proximal to the obstruction with symptoms of pain, abdominal disten￾sion and vomiting. Patients may also have abdominal compartment syndrome because \n\n【43】of the mass effect from the dilated bowel loop. Blood vessels supplying the involved \n\n【44】segment of bowel are subject to strangulation, and this can lead to bowel ischaemia and \n\n【45】infarction. Without definitive treatment, this carries a high mortality.\n\n【46】Differentiating between caecal and sigmoid volvulus can be difficult on plain radiograph:\n\n【47】• Sigmoid is commonly seen in the elderly with plain film findings of an isolated \n\n【48】enlarged loop of large bowel centred on the left side with cranial extension towards \n\n【49】the diaphragm. A midline fold that represents the twisted mesenteric axis can be seen, \n\n【50】causing the characteristic ‘coffee-bean’ appearance (arrow). There is often associated \n\n【51】transverse and ascending colon dilatation, with normal small bowel calibre if the ileo￾caecal valve is competent.\n\n【52】• Caecal is a disease of the young (averaging 30 years) with the dilated caecum rotating \n\n【53】anteriorly and lying in the left upper quadrant. This is associated with small bowel \n\n【54】dilatation and puts the patient at increased risk of bowel perforation.\n\n【55】Other types of volvulus include the following:\n\n【56】• Gastric: Rotation of the stomach around the supportive gastrohepatic (lesser curve) or \n\n【57】gastrocolic (greater curve) mesenteries can cause sudden onset severe abdominal pain \n\n【58】and vomiting. It is considered a surgical emergency carrying up to 80 per cent mor￾tality if treatment is not initiated quickly. There are two types: organoaxial (rotating \n\n【59】in a vertical axis, imaging reveals the characteristic appearances of a ‘mirror-image’ \n\n【60】stomach with the greater curve within the right upper quadrant) and mesenteroaxial \n\n【61】(rotating along a horizontal axis, the stomach appears to be upside down with the \n\n【62】pylorus seen at the expected gastro-oesophageal junction).\n\n【63】• Midgut volvulus (described in Case 88): This is associated with congenital malrota￾tion. Seen primarily in infants, the midgut rotates around the superior mesenteric \n\n【64】artery (SMA) axis, causing bowel obstruction and the characteristic ‘double-bubble’ \n\n【65】sign on plain radiograph.\n\n【66】 KEY POINTS\n\n【67】• Volvulus occurs when a loop of bowel twists around a mesenteric axis.\n\n【68】• Look for the characteristic ‘coffee-bean’ sign to help differentiate between a sigmoid \n\n【69】and caecal volvulus.\n\n【70】• Midgut volvulus is associated with congenital malrotation of the bowel.This page intentionally left blank 303\n\n【71】 ", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

She had been taking systemic corticosteroids for her deteriorating \n\n【28】respiratory sarcoid. This iatrogenic immunosuppression had left the patient vulnerable \n\n【29】to infection. She developed a Candida albicans intertrigo in her finger webs (confirmed \n\n【30】by yeast culture from her skin swab). This presentation is occasionally referred to as \n\n【31】erosio interdigitalis blastomycetica (interdigital candidosis) and can be associated with \n\n【32】occupations requiring frequent ‘wet work’ such as housework and gardening. Clinically, \n\n【33】this superficial yeast infection is characterized by erythema, maceration and peeling of \n\n【34】the flexural skin between the fingers. So-called ‘satellite lesions’ can often be seen as \n\n【35】small erythematous papules/pustules at the periphery of the area of yeast-infected skin. \n\n【36】Candida prefers a warm moist environment and hence the most commonly affected skin \n\n【37】sites include the groin, natal cleft, axillae, under the breasts and between the digits.\n\n【38】C. albicans yeast forms part of normal human flora, with reservoirs in the gastrointestinal \n\n【39】tract and vagina. C. albicans is not part of the normal skin flora, however it can tran￾siently colonize flexural areas. The fine balance between the patient’s immune system and \n\n【40】yeast numbers can be easily upset by minor changes in the local skin environment, use \n\n【41】of antibiotics, raised serum glucose and immune compromise through disease or medica￾tions leading to active candidiasis of the skin.\n\n【42】Management of Candida intertrigo includes trying to ensure the skin is kept as dry as \n\n【43】possible to make the local skin environmentally hostile to the yeast. This can be achieved \n\n【44】by using drying soaks such as potassium permanganate, antifungal powders and acetic \n\n【45】acid. Antifungal treatments can be given orally or applied topically. Many dermatologists \n\n【46】will try to manage localized disease with a topical combination antifungal cream plus \n\n【47】anti-inflammatory steroid.

Follow-ing several further tests， you diagnose him presumptively based on the multiple attacks and remissions of weakness and eye problems as having multiple scle-rosis (MS)， which is a disease of the white matter of the central nervous system.\n\n【2】**Describe the characteristics of white matter of the brain.**\n\n【3】卜What is the mechanism of the weakness caused by white matter degeneration?\n\n【4】What are the treatment options available to him?\n\n【5】Summary： A 37-year-old man with bouts of various waxing and waning neurological deficits is diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.\n\n【6】White matter characteristics： White matter within the brain consists of myelinated axons that connect various gray matter areas where neuron cell bodies are located to each other by carrying nerve impulses between neurons.\n\n【7】Mechanism of weakness： MS causes the gradual deterioration of the protective myelin sheaths around axons (demyelination) that facilitate signal conduction. Without myelin， the neurons cease to effectively conduct their electrical sig nals， resulting in a myriad of clinical symptoms (some presented above). MS is categorized as an autoimmune disease in which lymphocytes attack the myelin surrounding axons as if it were a foreign agent.\n\n【8】Treatment options： Beta interferon can help to reduce the number of exacerba-tions. High-dose intravenous corticosteroids or intravenous immunoglobulin can be administered to reduce the severity and duration of active attacks. Sev-eral other medications have been approved by the Food and Drug Administra-tion to treat symptoms of MS.\n\n【9】**CLINICAL CORRELATION**\n\n【10】MS is a demyelinating disease affecting only the white matter of the cerebrum， brain stem， and the spinal cord. For an unknown reason， MS is more common in north-ern latitudes， with an incidence of 30-80 per 100，000 in northern United States and Canada compared to 1 per 100，000 near the equator. MS is generally believed to be an autoimmune disease with the myelin sheaths in the CNS coming under attack from the immune system. The plaques start as an inflammatory response with monocyte and lymphocytic perivascular cuffing， followed by the formation of glial scars. Imaging and pathological studies demonstrate white matter plaques of various ages distributed throughout the CNS. The typical course of MS is of exacerbations and remissions over time. The most common symptoms include visual disturbances， spastic paraparesis， and bladder dysfunction. Internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) is a visual disturbance commonly associated with MS that results from a lesion in the midbrain affecting the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF). This lesion prevents the oculomotor nuclei and the abducens nuclei from coordinating their movements through the MLF With lateral gaze， the contralateral medial rectus fails to adduct the eye， while the ipsilateral lateral rectus abducts the eye. The dyscoordinated move-ments of the eye result in diplopia. MRI scans are the preferred imaging modality for diagnosis of this disease. Approximately 80% of individuals with a clinical diag-nosis of MS will exhibit white matter abnormalities on MRI scans. Analysis of the CSF from a lumbar puncture generally demonstrates normal opening pressures and increased CSF protein levels. CSF IgG is increased relative to other CSF proteins in approximately 90% of patients with confirmed MS. Gel electrophoresis of the CSF\n\n【11】reveals oligoclonal bands. Diagnosis relies on a combination of patient history and physical examination supported by imaging and CSF study results. While there is no cure for MS， there are several treatment strategies available to slow the progression of the disease， reduce the frequency of attacks， and shorten the duration of attacks.\n\n【12】**OBJECTIVES**\n\n【13】1\\.

Because the cytoplasm of the axon is electrically conductive and because the myelin inhibits charge leakage through the membrane， depolarization at one node of Ran-vier is sufficient to elevate the voltage at a neighboring node to the threshold for action potential initiation， allowing action potentials to hop along an axon instead of propagating in waves.\n\n【19】THRESHOLD： An irreversible point at which the initial depolarization of the membrane results in the rapid opening of all of the voltage-gated ion channels； usu-ally action threshold potentials are around -45 mV.\n\n【20】AXON HILLOCK： The region of the neuron between the cell body and the axon which generates action potentials.\n\n【21】REFRACTORY PERIODS： The period of time in which it is either impossible or difficult for additional stimuli to generate another action potential.\n\n【22】**DISCUSSION**\n\n【23】Myelin sheaths are produced by the oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system and by Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system. It is important to note， how-ever， that not all axons are encased in myelin sheaths. Myelin consists of lipids and membrane proteins， which are wrapped in circumferential layers around segments of axons. The intervals between adjacent myelin sheaths are called the nodes of Ranvier and are important for conduction of the action potential.\n\n【24】During the development of the peripheral nervous system， Schwann cells become closely associated with developing bundles of axons within the nerve. A single\n\n【25】Schwann cell provides a single segment of the myelin sheath for the developing axon. As axons grow and elongate， the Schwann cells divide by mitosis to ensure complete coverage of the selected axon. This is in contrast to the central ner-vous system， where oligodendrocytes extend processes to multiple axons to pro-vide myelin sheaths. One oligodendrocyte can provide a segment of myelin for up to 60 different axons. Myelin sheaths are laminated when examined by electron microscopy； this is caused by the sequential wrapping of the myelin around the axon. During this wrapping process， the cytoplasm of the Schwann cells and oli-godendrocytes are squeezed out of the developing myelin sheath. In the end， the layers of the cell membrane are opposed and are secured in place by proteins， such as myelin basic protein， proteolipid protein， and protein zero， that are embedded in the lipid membrane.\n\n【26】At the nodes of Ranvier， the myelin sheaths meet but do not join. In this region， the axon is exposed to the extracellular environment. The voltage-gated ion chan-nels necessary for the saltatory conduction of the action potential are concentrated in this region of the axon.\n\n【27】A typical action potential lasts for less than 1 ms and is elicited in an all-or-nothing fashion. Neurons code the intensity of a stimulus by the frequency and not by the amplitude of action potentials. The action potential is crucial for the passage of information via electrical impulses over long distances and is generated by voltage-gated ion channels. These channels alter their selective permeability to a specific ion based upon changes in the transmembrane potential. Specific voltage-gated channels include Na+， K\\*， and Ca+ channels. The action potential is a regen-erative signal that does not lose amplitude as it travels down the axon and rely on voltage-gated Na\\* and K+ channels.\n\n【28】The tertiary structure of the voltage-gated ion channel is determined by the transmembrane potential in the local environment. With changes to the transmem-brane potential， the channel either opens or closes to modulate the flow of ions. These channels are typically open for a very short period of time， 10 us or less， and function as an \"all-or-nothing”type response. At the resting membrane potential of neurons， the voltage-gated Nat and K+ channels are generally in their closed configuration.\n\n【29】The action potential is generated at the axon hillock， the region between the soma of the neuron and the axon， which contains a higher number of voltage-gated Nat channels than anywhere else in the neuron. As the neuron receives signals from the dendrites and soma， they converge at the axon hillock. As the stimulus is received， some of the voltage-gated Nat channels open， resulting in the influx of positive Na\\* ions into the cell and a small depolarization of the axon hillock. If the stimulus is strong enough， it will cause more and more of the voltage-gated Nat channels to open through positive feedback by the Nat ions until a point is reached where the depolarization becomes irreversible. This point is called the threshold (Figure 4-1). The Nat channels remain open for a brief period of time before they are inactivated by a conformational change that results in channel closing.\n\n【30】The depolarization also affects the voltage-gated K+ channels. However， these channels open more slowly and for a longer period of time in response to the initial\n\n【31】Figure 4-1. Components of an action potential.\n\n【32】depolarization and allow K+ ions to flow out of the cell. The peak flow of K+ ions occurs as the sodium current is decreasing. This results in repolarization. In the later stages of the action potential， the K+ efflux is unopposed and drives the transmem-brane potential past the resting potential and closer to the equilibrium potential for K\\* ions. As the voltage-gated K+ channels close， the resting channels allow for the reestablishment of the resting membrane potential.\n\n【33】Shortly after threshold is reached， there is a period of time where additional stim-uli will not result in any action potential. This is termed the absolute refractory period and is owing to the already maximal opening of the Nat channels. The Na+channels begin to close even in the presence of continued presence of the depo-larization； the channels become inactivated， and it takes time for them to recover from the inactivation before they are able to open again. Na\\* is critical for the action potential： if the extracellular concentration of Na\\* falls the amplitude of the action potential decreases. Following the peak of the action potential， additional\n\n【34】supernormal stimuli may result in the generation of another action potential. This period is the relative refractory period. As the K+ channels close， the membrane slowly approaches its resting membrane potential. Typically， repolarization of the cell by closing K\\* channels results in an overshoot of resting membrane potential， creating a refractory period where the membrane potential equalizes to resting state. During this period， the nerve can be restimulated to fire an action potential by a supernormal stimulus. A larger than normal depolarizing stimulus is required to overcome the overshoot during repolarization by the voltage-gated K+ channels.\n\n【35】For a neuron to signal other cells over distances， the action potential must be propagated down the length of the axon. The initial depolarization and resulting action potential occurs in only a small segment of the axon， creating a local cur-rent. This depolarizing current travels distally down the axon and results in the next under-threshold segment reaching threshold. This segment then generates another action potential， ensuring that the amplitude of the signal is not attenuated as it travels. The signal can only travel in one direction because of the refractory period of the channels.\n\n【36】The conduction velocity of the fastest axons in the human body transmits action potentials at a rate of 120 m/s through large， myelinated axons. Smaller， unmy-elinated axons conduct action potentials at approximately 0.5 m/s. In the axons of invertebrates， such as the well-studied giant squid axon， conduction velocities are increased by increasing the diameter of the axon up to 1 mm. This strategy decreases the resistance through the axon. Mammals， which tend to have much smaller axons， employ myelin sheaths to increase the membrane resistance of the axon， resulting in faster conduction velocities.\n\n【37】Because of the myelin sheaths， voltage-gated channels are clustered at the nodes of Ranvier and are the only points along a myelinated axon where currents can be generated. Furthermore， the myelin sheaths prevent any significant loss in ampli-tude of the action potential at the internodal segments， the region of the axon cov-ered by myelin. This allows the signal to jump quickly from one node of Ranvier to another while skipping the internodal segments， a process termed saltatory conduc-tion (Figure 4-2). In unmyelinated axons， the current spreads more slowly because of the decreased membrane resistance and lack of saltatory conduction.\n\n【38】Although the two-channel system examined in the Nobel Prize-winning work by Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley in the squid giant axon is found in almost every type of neuron， there are several other types of voltage-gated ion channels. This diversity allows for a much more complex information processing system.\n\n【39】One interesting clinical observation is that if chronic hyponatremia is corrected too quickly， patients may develop osmotic demyelination of the axons of the central part of the pons. Central pontine myelinolysis presents as quadriplegia due to demy-elination of the corticospinal tracts， and pseudobulbar palsy due to demyelination of the corticobulbar tracts (cranial nerves X， XI， and XII)， resulting in dysphagia， dysarthria， and neck muscle weakness.\n\n【40】See Cases 1-10 (cellular and molecular neuroscience cases).\n\n【41】Figure 4-2.

If this habit continues after 2 1/2–3 years of age, it is considered pathological and disrupts the dental-maxillary harmony. It is also considered a triggering factor of orofacial muscular imbalance which in turn causes open anterior open bite (Melsen et al. 1979 , 1987 ) (Fig. 2.9a, b ).\n\n【2】Fig. 2.9\n\n【3】( a ) Young child with digital sucking. ( b ) Oral facial muscle imbalance with open bite\n\n【4】1.  B.\n    \n    Habit of tongue sucking. The upper incisors bite the back of the tongue during the day and night, stimulating the displacement of the lower maxillary which causes the open bite. This habit causes great deformity and has a psychological component which must be given priority during dental treatment and myofunctional therapy (Fig. 2.10a–d ).\n\n【5】Fig. 2.10\n\n【6】( a ) Tongue thrust into rest.

When it continues beyond 3 years of age, the dysfunctional behavior of the tongue affects the dental relation.\n\n【8】Fig. 2.11\n\n【9】Prolonged use of feeding bottle\n\n【10】1.  D.\n    \n    Another significant issue is the persistent use of pacifiers (Fig. 2.12 ). When it is used beyond 3 years of age, it is no longer physiological and becomes pathological, thus generating alterations in the growth and development of the mouth and position of the teeth.\n\n【11】Fig. 2.12\n\n【12】Prolonged uses of pacifiers\n\n【13】1.  E.\n    \n    The presence of hypertrophied tonsils can cause functional problems. Since they are swollen, they predispose the displacement of the tongue in a posterior-anterior direction, generating protrusion of the tongue while swallowing (Fig. 2.13 ).\n\n【14】Fig. 2.13\n\n【15】Presence of hypertrophied tonsils\n\n【16】Hypertrophied adenoids cause difficulties in nasal breathing, and this modifies the position of the tongue at rest. Also, swallowing becomes dysfunctional.\n\n【17】In addition, dysfunctional swallowing can be caused by emotional immaturity because of emotional lip movements and difficulty adapting.\n\n【18】1.  F.\n    \n    The short tongue frenum limits the mobility of the tongue which can’t make contact with the palate, altering its behavior during swallowing and talking (Fig. 2.14 ).\n\n【19】Fig. 2.14\n\n【20】Short tongue frenum\n\n【21】1.  G.\n    \n    When the premature loss of the incisors is present, the tip of the tongue can’t rest against the retro-incisive papillae while swallowing. It pushes forth due to the absence of teeth and a dental and functional open bite will be the result.\n    \n2.  H.\n    \n    Blocked noses. Whether this occurs because of a deviated septum or other causes, it affects muscular balance, altering dental-alveolar development and causing dysfunctional swallowing (Fig. 2.15a, b ).\n\n【22】Fig. 2.15\n\n【23】( a ) Facial appearance caused by mouth breathing. ( b ) Open bite as a consequence of a dysfunctional swallowing\n\n【24】1.  I.\n    \n    Sucking two fingers. This habit is considered pathological and disrupts the dental-maxillary harmony. As a result, the patient will have hypercontraction of the mental muscles or dysfunctional swallowing with lip thrust and altered teeth relationship as a consequence (Fig. 2.16a–d ).\n\n【25】Fig. 2.16\n\n【26】( a ) Girl sucking two fingers. ( b ) Hypercontraction of the mental muscles. ( c ) Dysfunctional swallowing with lip thrust. ( d ) Altered tooth relationship\n\n【27】The causes mentioned affect malleable alveolar edges that are being calcified. This distortive pressure produces changes in facial and dental development of the child. The altered forces against dental arches, teeth, and soft tissues produce dental and functional disturbances in the stomatognathic system.\n\n【28】### 2.1.4 Functions of the Respiratory System\n\n【29】Respiration is a chemical and biological mechanism that ensues an abundant supply of oxygen for the cells, eliminating carbon dioxide and controlling ventilation. The newborn baby activates the respiratory system when they begin to breathe through the nose.\n\n【30】The mechanical motion of air passing through the nostrils activates nerve endings found there, which generate responses. Some of the most important are the control of the movement of the thorax, ventilation, tridimensional development of nostrils, the base of the upper maxilla, and the size of the sinuses as well as many other stimuli that are vital for the body.\n\n【31】Nasal breathing leads to the liberation of energy needed for growth, development, and maturation of the child and youth and also provides the energy adults need for both intellectual and physical activities (Juri).\n\n【32】As air passes through the nostrils, it is conditioned. Since it is humidified and warmed, it is sterilized.\n\n【33】The motion of inhaling and exhaling through the nose is a morphogenetic condition produced by tension and distension in the area of the facial bone sutures and mouth. Since these bones have intramembranous ossification and are joined by sutures, they respond to functional stimuli. Air, especially when exhaled, is one of these stimuli. The maxilla is responsible for transversal growth of the face. Along with sinuses, they contribute to the development of the top middle third of the face. This area is similar to a honeycomb, with many small cells through which exhaled warm air enters, generating pressure that causes the distention, its development, and even its migration.\n\n【34】This is why air is considered to be responsible for the shape of the face. Its presence contributes to the harmonious growth and development of the face (Moyano).\n\n【35】The air that is exhaled exerts pressure toward the base of the nostrils. Since the tongue rests upon the palate, each time swallowing takes place, it presses against the hard palate, generating negative intraoral pressure that contributes to the descent of the palate. Since the lips are closed, it causes the upper lip to traction the anterior nasal spine, contributing to the advancement and descent of the maxilla (Moyano).\n\n【36】### 2.1.5 Repercussions of Mouth Breathing\n\n【37】It is important to discard diseases in organs present in the respiratory system above all, those in the upper respiratory tract. Referral to an ear, nose, and throat specialist is recommended (Fig. 2.17a–c ).\n\n【38】Fig. 2.17\n\n【39】( a ) Poor facial appearance due to mouth breathing. ( b ) The tongue is on the base of the mouth. ( c ) Dentoalveolar crossbite\n\n【40】Mouth breathing with lip thrust during rest and swallowing causes the protrusion of the upper maxilla and the extrusion of the lower incisors. In concordance with a pale face, sad eyes and dark circles (Sabaschi) were clearly observed.\n\n【41】In addition mouth breathing produces dry lips in conjunction with hypertrophied gums that bleed very easily (Figs. 2.18a–d ).\n\n【42】Fig. 2.18\n\n【43】( a ) Lip incompetence. ( b ) Labial interposition at rest and swallowing. ( c ) Protrusion of the upper maxilla. ( d ) Extrusion of the lower incisors\n\n【44】Since mouth breathing alters the whole cranio-orofacial system, an altered posture is observed in almost all the patients with a tendency toward thoracic kyphosis and protrusive shoulder blades (Hanson and Barrett 1988 ; Hanson and Mason 2003 ) (Fig. 2.19a, b ).\n\n【45】The collaboration with the physiotherapist is so important in correcting posture in order to achieve normal growth in these children.\n\n【46】Fig. 2.19\n\n【47】( a ) Tendency toward thoracic kyphosis. ( b ) Protrusive shoulder blades\n\n【48】Myofunctional therapy is a specialty within speech therapy that was designed to correct the functional alterations in breathing, swallowing, chewing, and language to achieve a muscular factorial balance which affect the dental arches.\n\n【49】Myofunctional therapy is a discipline that collaborates in orthodontics.\n\n【50】This specialist is familiarized with the orthodontic terms which allows them to work in an interdisciplinary team to attend different aspects of the dysfunctions present in patients without forgetting the biological, social, and psychological aspects.\n\n【51】Conclusions\n\n【52】The orofacial shape is caused by minimal pressure exerted by soft surrounding tissues. The stimuli generated by functions such as nasal breathing, functional swallowing, and efficient chewing collaborate in optimal bone growth and development.\n\n【53】When functional or anatomical alterations are present, the cranial-cervical orofacial system has the capacity to compensate and adapt to certain cases with deformities of the structures, thus producing an increase or decrease of bone growth.\n\n【54】The upper maxillary is responsible for the transversal growth of the face. It contains the bones that compose the intramembranous ossification that are responsible for these functions.\n\n【55】A myofunctional therapist is a speech therapist that has a specialization and can evaluate, forecast, and correct these functional alterations, and consequently the muscular orofacial pressure interdisciplinary teams are necessary to achieve treatment goals in the most efficient way possible. The ear, nose, and throat specialist will attend to and solve problems related to the high respiratory tract. The physiotherapist can participate in correcting posture in order to achieve harmony, flexibility, and the adequate muscle tone (Zickefoose and Zickefoose 2000 ).\n\n【56】The psychologist can provide counseling in cases where habits are a consequence of emotional distress.\n\n【57】When other disciplines are considered, the objective of orthodontics goes beyond mere dental relation:\n\n【58】1.  1.\n    \n    Making accurate etiological diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment plan is essential.\n    \n2.  2.\n    \n    Interdisciplinary teamwork.\n    \n3.  3.\n    \n    Choose order and priorities of professional team members that are going to intervene and make sure criteria for treatment are uniform.\n    \n4.  4.\n    \n    Reinstate form and function with harmony and balance.\n    \n5.  5.\n    \n    Integrate the family of the patient to ensure treatment objectives.\n    \n6.  6.\n    \n    Keep in mind that the main objective is the patient’s well-being.\n\n【59】The importance of an early treatment to re-establish a normal growth with integrated team members cannot be denied.\n\n【60】", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

She describes the discharge as being green-yellow in color with a bad odor. She has never had this type of discharge in the past. She complains of increased vaginal soreness and discharge after she has intercourse. She denies any itching, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, or sweats. She is currently sexually active and is using an intrauterine device (IUD) as her contraceptive method. She has been with one male partner for the past 3 months and he has no symptoms. She does state that she first had intercourse at age 15 and has had multiple sexual partners. She had a chlamydial infection 2 years ago that was treated with oral antibiotics. Her last menstrual period was 2 weeks ago and was normal. She also denies any recent antibiotic treatment. On examination, she is afebrile, has normal vital signs, and appears to be in no acute distress. Her general physical examination is normal. On pelvic examination, she has normal external genitalia. She has a small amount of frothy, homogenous green-gray discharge at the introitus. The cervix has a “strawberry”-red appearance with a slight amount of discharge noted in the os. The IUD string is in place. _Chlamydia_ and gonorrhea specimens are obtained from the os and a sample of the vaginal discharge is collected for microscopic evaluation. Bimanual examination shows no cervical motion tenderness, and a normal uterus and adnexa.\n\n【3】 What organism is the most likely cause of her symptoms?\n\n【4】 What would you expect to see on microscopic examination of the vaginal discharge?\n\n【5】 What is the recommended treatment for this infection?\n\n【6】### ANSWERS TO CASE 22:  \nVaginitis\n\n【7】_Summary:_ A 25-year-old woman presents with a foul-smelling vaginal discharge. She has a greenish, frothy discharge and a “strawberry cervix” noted on examination.\n\n【8】• Organism most likely to cause this infection: _Trichomonas vaginalis_\n\n【9】• Expected microscopic examination findings: Motile, flagellated trichomonads, and many white blood cells\n\n【10】• Recommended treatment: Metronidazole 2 g by mouth in a single dose for both the patient and her sexual partner. Metronidazole 500 mg twice a day for a week is an alternate regimen.\n\n【11】### ANALYSIS\n\n【12】#### _Objectives_\n\n【13】1\\. Be able to differentiate among common presentations of vaginitis on the basis of clinical information and laboratory testing.\n\n【14】2\\. Know the current guidelines for treatment of the various etiologies of vaginitis.\n\n【15】#### _Considerations_\n\n【16】Women with vaginitis may present with a variety of symptoms, including vaginal discharge, itching, odor, and dysuria. There are many potential causes of vaginitis, including sexually transmitted pathogens and overgrowth of organisms found in the normal vaginal flora. Common among the causes of vaginitis are _Candida albicans, Trichomonas vaginalis_ , and _Gardnerella vaginalis_ .\n\n【17】Certain historical information may lead a clinician to suspect a specific cause of vaginitis in a given patient. For example, a history of recent antibiotic use may predispose to a _Candida_ vaginitis, as the antibiotic may alter the normal vaginal flora and allow the overgrowth of a fungal organism. Women with diabetes mellitus are also more predisposed to developing yeast infections. A history of multiple sexual partners may raise the likelihood of a sexually transmitted infection, such as trichomoniasis.\n\n【18】The patient’s symptoms and signs may also suggest a specific organism as the cause of her vaginitis. Fungal infections tend to have thick discharge and cause significant pruritus. The discharge of bacterial vaginosis is often thinner and patients complain of a “fishy” odor. _Trichomonas_ produces a discharge that is usually frothy and the patient’s cervix is frequently very erythematous.\n\n【19】The key test to determining the cause of vaginal discharge, which guides the specific treatment, is microscopic examination of the discharge. A sample of the discharge is examined both as a “wet mount” (ie, mixed with a small amount of normal saline) and as a “KOH prep” (ie, mixed with a small amount of 10% potassium hydroxide). On wet mount, the examiner can evaluate the normal epithelial cells and look for white blood cells, red blood cells, clue cells, and motile trichomonads. The hyphae or pseudohyphae of _Candida_ are best seen on KOH prep.\n\n【20】### APPROACH TO:  \nVaginal Infections\n\n【21】### DEFINITIONS\n\n【22】BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS: Condition of excessive anaerobic bacteria in the vagina, leading to a discharge that is alkaline.\n\n【23】CANDIDA VULVOVAGINITIS: Vaginal and/or vulvar infection caused by _Candida_ species, usually with heterogenous discharge and inflammation.\n\n【24】TRICHOMONAS VAGINITIS: Infection of the vagina caused by the protozoa _Trichomonas vaginalis_ , usually associated with a frothy green discharge and intense inflammatory response.\n\n【25】### CLINICAL APPROACH  \nETIOLOGIES\n\n【26】#### _Vulvovaginal Candidiasis_\n\n【27】This infection is typically caused by _C albicans_ , although other species are occasionally identified. More than 75% of women have at least one episode during their lifetime. The presenting symptom is a thick, whitish discharge that has no odor and the patient complains of significant pruritus of the external and internal genitalia. On physical examination, the vaginal area can be edematous with erythema present. The discharge has a pH between 4.0 and 5.0. The diagnosis is confirmed by wet mount or KOH preparation showing budding yeast or pseudohyphae. Fungal cultures are not needed to confirm the diagnosis , but they are useful if the infection recurs or is unresponsive to treatment. Numerous treatment options are available for patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis, including over-the-counter and prescription medications. Uncomplicated candidiasis can be treated effectively with short-term intravaginal preparations (creams or vaginal suppositories) or single-dose oral therapies (fluconazole 150 mg). Treatment of complicated or recurrent infection should begin with an intensive regimen for 10 to 14 days followed by 6 months of maintenance therapy to reduce the likelihood of recurrence. Treatment of sexual partners is not indicated unless symptomatic (eg, man partners with balanitis).\n\n【28】#### _Trichomoniasis_\n\n【29】This infection is caused by the protozoan _T vaginalis_ and is classified as a sexually transmitted disease. The incubation period is 3 to 21 days after exposure. Certain factors predispose to infection, such as multiple sexual partners, pregnancy, and menopause . The presenting complaint is copious amounts of a thin, frothy, green-yellow or gray malodorous vaginal discharge. Women can also have vaginal soreness or dyspareunia. Symptoms may start or be exacerbated during the time of their menses. Vaginal examination may reveal that the cervix has a “strawberry” appearance (red and inflamed with punctations) or that redness of the vagina and perineum is present. Microscopically, the wet mount preparation can demonstrate motile trichomonads , although cultures may be necessary because of the significant number of false-negative results. The recommended treatment for trichomoniasis is oral metronidazole, given in a single, 2-g oral dose or 1-week regimen of 500 mg twice a day to both the patient and her sexual partner. It is important to screen for other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and to remember to treat the partner to ensure better cure rates.\n\n【30】#### _Bacterial Vaginosis_\n\n【31】Bacterial vaginosis (BV) arises when normal vaginal bacteria are replaced with an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria and _G vaginalis_ . Although not an STD, it is associated with having multiple sexual partners. Diagnosis can be based on the presence of three of four clinical criteria: (1) a thin, homogenous vaginal discharge; (2) a vaginal pH more than 4.5; (3) a positive KOH “whiff” test (a fishy odor present after the addition of 10% KOH to a sample of the discharge); and (4) the presence of clue cells in a wet mount preparation ( Figure 22–1 ). Culture is generally not needed. Treatment options include both oral and topical vaginal preparations of metronidazole or clindamycin. There are no advantages to any of these regimens with regard to cure rates or recurrence, although patients do report more satisfaction with the vaginal preparations. Treatment of BV in asymptomatic pregnant women may reduce the incidence of preterm delivery. Treatment of sexual partners is not necessary and does not reduce the risk of recurrent infection.\n\n【32】Figure 22–1. Bacterial vaginosis. (A) “Clue cells.” (B) Normal epithelium. ( _Reproduced, with permission, from Kasper DL, Braunwald E, Fauci A, et al_ . Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine. _16th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; 2005:767_ .)\n\n【33】#### _Mucopurulent Cervicitis_\n\n【34】This infection is characterized by purulent or mucopurulent discharge from the endocervix, which may be associated with vaginal discharge and/or cervical bleeding. The diagnostic evaluation should include testing for _Chlamydia trachomatis_ and _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_ , although the etiologic agent is not always found. Absence of symptoms should not prevent additional evaluation and treatment, as approximately 50% of gonococcal infections and 70% of chlamydial infections are asymptomatic in women. The gold standard for establishing the diagnosis is a culture of the cervical discharge. Empiric treatment should be considered in areas of high prevalence of infection or if follow-up is unlikely. The treatment recommendation for gonorrhea is ceftriaxone 125 mg intramuscularly. Because of the growing problem of antibiotic resistance, quinolone antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin) are no longer recommended for treatment of gonorrhea. The recommended treatment for _Chlamydia_ infections is doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days or azithromycin in a single 1-g oral dose when compliance is a concern. Typical treatment regimens will cover for both gonorrhea and chlamydia and the treatment of sexual partners is advised.\n\n【35】#### _Pelvic Inflammatory Disease_\n\n【36】Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is defined as inflammation of the upper genital tract, including pelvic peritonitis, endometritis, salpingitis, and tuboovarian abscess caused by infection with gonorrhea, _Chlamydia_ , or vaginal and bowel flora. Lower abdominal tenderness with both adnexal and cervical motion tenderness without other explanation of illness is enough to diagnose PID . Other criteria that enhance the specificity of the diagnosis include temperature more than 101°F, abnormal cervical or vaginal discharge, elevated sedimentation rate, elevated C-reactive protein, and cervical infection with gonorrhea or _Chlamydia_ . Definitive diagnosis rests on techniques that are not generally used or readily available to make the diagnosis, such as laparoscopic findings consistent with PID, endometrial biopsy showing endometritis, and ultrasound examination findings showing thickened fluid-filled tubes with or without free pelvic fluid or tuboovarian complex. Because of the clinical similarity between PID and ectopic pregnancy, a serum pregnancy test should be performed on all patients suspected of having PID.\n\n【37】Determination of appropriate treatment should consider pregnancy status, severity of illness, and compliance. Less-severe disease can generally be treated on an outpatient basis. Women who are pregnant, have HIV, or have severe disease generally require inpatient therapy and treatment with parenteral antibiotics. Table 22–1 lists PID treatment regimens.\n\n【38】Table 22–1 • TREATMENT REGIMENS FOR PID\n\n【39】Oral\n\n【40】Regimen A\n\n【41】• Ceftriaxone 250 mg IM single dose _or_ cefoxitin 2 g IM with probenecid 1 g PO given concurrently\n\n【42】• _Plus_ doxycycline 100 mg PO BID for 14 d\n\n【43】• _With or without_ metronidazole 500 mg PO BID for 14 d\n\n【44】Regimen B\n\n【45】• Cefotaxime 1 g IM single dose _or_ Ceftizoxime 1 g IM single dose\n\n【46】• _Plus_ doxycycline 100 mg PO BID for 14 d\n\n【47】• _With or without_ metronidazole 500 mg PO BID for 14 d\n\n【48】Parenteral\n\n【49】Regimen A\n\n【50】• Cefotetan 2 g IV every 12 h _or_ cefoxitin 2 g IV every 6 h\n\n【51】• _Plus_ doxycycline 100 mg PO _or_ IV every 12 h Regimen B\n\n【52】• Clindamycin 900 mg IV every 8 h\n\n【53】• _Plus_ gentamicin 2 mg/kg loading dose followed by 1.5 mg/kg IV of 8 h Regimen C\n\n【54】• Ampicillin/sulbactam 3 g IV every 6 h plus doxycycline 100 mg PO or IV of 2 h\n\n【55】Patients who have PID need to be aware of potential complications, including the potential for recurrence of disease, the development of tuboovarian abscess, chronic abdominal pain, infertility, and the increased risk of ectopic pregnancy. It is important to discuss these potential problems with patients who are given a diagnosis of PID. All patients with STDs or who are at risk for developing STDs should be counseled on safer sexual practices, including abstinence, monogamy, and the use of latex condoms.\n\n【56】### ", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

He has signs of chronic liver disease and his liver function tests are \n\n【33】consistent with this. Other causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with liver \n\n【34】disease include peptic ulcer disease, Mallory–Weiss tear, portal hypertensive gastropathy \n\n【35】and gastric antral vascular ectasia. Thrombocytopenia is common in cirrhosis due to a \n\n【36】combination of reduced thrombopoietin levels, splenic sequestration of platelets and bone \n\n【37】marrow suppression.\n\n【38】The estimation of blood loss is often difficult from a patient’s story. Haematemesis is a fright￾ening symptom and the amount may be overestimated. The haemoglobin level in this case is \n\n【39】low and there is significant postural hypotension. His pulse is not fast as he is taking a beta \n\n【40】blocker. He has signs of chronic liver disease. This is likely to be a very serious bleed. Only \n\n【41】50% of patients with varcieal haemorrhage stop bleeding spontaneously, and there is a very \n\n【42】high risk of bleeding in the next 6 weeks.\n\n【43】The patient needs to be resuscitated with transfusion via a large-bore peripheral intravenous \n\n【44】line or a central line. FFP and platelets are needed to correct coagulopathy and thrombocy￾topenia, respectively. Intravenous antibiotics reduce infectious complications in hospitalised \n\n【45】cirrhotic patients.\n\n【46】Endoscopy is required to identify the bleeding point. Bleeding oesophageal varices should \n\n【47】be treated with oesophageal band ligation or sclerotherapy. Balloon tamponade is effective at \n\n【48】achieving short-term haemostasis, and may be used until more definitive treatment is avail￾able. Terlipressin or octreotide reduce bleeding. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic \n\n【49】shunts or surgery are reserved for patients who continue to bleed despite the above measures.\n\n【50】After he has been stabilised he needs to be asked questions about his alcohol intake.

In the most extreme cases， when respiratory distress is present， tonsil-lectomy can be required. Corticosteroids reduce virus shedding and provide some symptomatic relief as a result of their anti-inflammatory effects. They do not sig-nificantly alter the course of the disease.**\n\n【4】Immunocompromised individuals are at high risk of severe lymphoproliferative disease and B-cell lymphoma after infection with EBV or reactivation of this infec-tion. An example of congenital immunodeficiency characterized by a high risk of EBV-driven lymphocproliferative disease is represented by X-linked lymphocpro-liferative disease type 1 or type 2 (see Case 13). In these circumstances， monitor-ing of the infection is best performed by evaluating the number of viral copies in peripheral blood. If a significant viremia is detected， treatment is most often based on injection of the B-cell-depleting anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab， which destroys both infected and uninfected B lymphocytes. This treatment causes a profound B-cell lymphopenia and hypogammaglobulinemia， which requires immunoglobulin replacement therapy until circulating B lymphocytes reappear in normal numbers.\n\n【5】The ability of EBV to transform B cells is an extremely useful laboratory tool. When peripheral blood B cells are cultured with EBV， they become immortalized at a rela-tively high frequency and can be propagated indefinitely in vitro. This allows the general study of various aspects of B-cell biology， as well as providing material for the study of individual patients.\n\n【6】The virus-encoded Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA-2) is critical for transformation.EBNA-2 protein interacts with transcription factors， leading to the activation of several host genes， for example those encoding B-cell activating mol-ecules such as CD21 (the EBV receptor) and CD23 (FceRII， the low-affinity receptor for IgE)， and viral genes such as LMP-1 (latent membrane protein-1， the primary oncogene of EBV). EBNA-3，-4，-5， and-6also have a role in B-cell transformation.\n\n【7】Acute IM is only one of the possible outcomes of EBV infection. The Epstein-Barr virus is in fact named after two workers who studied Burkitt's lymphoma in Africa in the 1960s and first cultured thevirus from these patients. This B-cell lymphoma is strongly associated with EBV infection in Africa， but not in other parts of the world； the high rate of EBV infection in early infancy together with the high incidence of malaria in Africa seem to be the predisposing factors. In Southeast Asia， EBVinfec-tion is strongly associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. This may be because a high proportion of people in Southeast Asia carry a certain HLA class I allele， but the epitope it would interact with is missing from the predominant Southeast Asian EBV strain. These people， therefore， are not efficient at clearing cells infected with this EBV strain， making transformation and eventual malignancy more likely.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Outline the key steps in managing this patient.302\n\n【23】100 Cases in Emergency Medicine and Critical Care\n\n【24】DISCUSSION\n\n【25】This patient is suffering with hyperemesis gravidarum, which accounts for one of the most \n\n【26】common indications for hospital admission. It is defined as severe or long-lasting nausea and \n\n【27】vomiting, appearing for the first time within the first trimester of pregnancy, and is so severe \n\n【28】that weight loss, dehydration and electrolyte imbalance may occur. It affects less than 4% \n\n【29】of pregnant women, although up to 80% of women suffer from some degree of nausea and \n\n【30】vomiting throughout their pregnancy. Although the pathophysiology is poorly understood, \n\n【31】it is thought to be associated with rising levels of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) \n\n【32】hormone. Therefore, conditions that give rise to exaggerated levels of hCG such as multiple \n\n【33】pregnancy and trophoblastic disease are risk factors. Other risk factors include obesity, nul￾liparous women and a previous history of hyperemesis gravidarum or motion sickness.\n\n【34】Classically, patients present with a long history of nausea and vomiting that becomes pro￾gressively worse, despite treatment with simple antiemetics. They are unable to keep down \n\n【35】any food or fluids and attend looking severely dehydrated. They may have lost over 5% of \n\n【36】their pre-pregnancy weight and will have evidence of ketonuria.\n\n【37】Other medical or surgical causes of nausea and vomiting must be excluded when making \n\n【38】a diagnosis of hyperemesis gravidarum. Conditions such as peptic ulcer disease, bowel \n\n【39】obstruction, pancreatitis, gastroenteritis, cholecystitis, appendicitis, hepatitis and a urinary \n\n【40】tract infection are differentials that must be considered. Metabolic conditions such as thy￾rotoxicosis and drug-induced nausea and vomiting are also other conditions that should be \n\n【41】kept in mind.\n\n【42】Investigations are required to rule out other causes of nausea and vomiting. The Pregnancy￾Unique Quantification of Emesis (PUQE) can be used as an objective measure to classify \n\n【43】the severity of nausea and vomiting. Basic blood tests include full blood count, electrolytes \n\n【44】(including calcium and phosphate) and liver and thyroid function tests. A venous blood gas \n\n【45】can be performed in diabetics to exclude diabetic ketoacidosis. Urinalysis can be used to \n\n【46】investigate the degree of urinary ketones and the presence or absence of an infection. An \n\n【47】ultrasound scan should be scheduled in the gynaecology department to confirm viability and \n\n【48】gestational age, as well as to exclude a multiple pregnancy or trophoblastic disease. Severe \n\n【49】abdominal pain may warrant further investigation with a serum amylase, an abdominal \n\n【50】ultrasound or an oesophageal gastroduodenoscopy, if deemed appropriate.\n\n【51】The treatment of hyperemesis gravidarum is mainly supportive, as it is a self-limiting condi￾tion. However, treatment is required to avoid future complications such as hyponatraemia, \n\n【52】hypokalaemia and Wernicke’s encephalopathy and to allow the patient to get back to her \n\n【53】activities of daily living. Management involves rehydration with intravenous fluids supple￾mented with potassium to correct the hypokalaemia, initially given quickly over 2–4 hours. \n\n【54】Dextrose is contraindicated in these patients as it may precipitate encephalopathy and worsen \n\n【55】hyponatraemia. Antiemetics should be given intravenously or intramuscularly if unable to \n\n【56】be taken orally. Cyclizine is considered first-line anti-emetic and metoclopramide is used as \n\n【57】second-line treatment. Ondansetron is often considered as third-line. Gastric protection with \n\n【58】ranitidine and vitamin supplementation using IV thiamine (pabrinex) initially, followed by \n\n【59】oral thiamine and folic acid, is given to prevent possible complications. Whilst inpatient, \n\n【60】thromboprophylaxis is required in the form of low-molecular-weight heparin and compres￾sion stockings as these women are at high risk of a venous thromboembolism secondary to \n\n【61】pregnancy, immobility and dehydration. Rarely, nutritional supplementation (enteral or par￾enteral) and corticosteroids are required in intractable severe cases of hyperemesis.303\n\n【62】Case 88: Vomiting in pregnancy\n\n【63】Ambulatory daycare management is suitable for most patients who are unable to tolerate oral \n\n【64】antiemetics or fluids. Inpatient management should be considered in those with a severe elec￾trolyte abnormality, significant co-morbidities or recurrent episodes of nausea and vomiting \n\n【65】or hyperemesis gravidarum. Women who have vomiting but who are not dehydrated or can \n\n【66】tolerate medications orally can be managed within the community.\n\n【67】Key Points\n\n【68】• Hyperemesis gravidarum is more common with family history, trophoblastic dis￾ease and multiple pregnancy.\n\n【69】• Assess all women for dehydration and electrolyte disturbance.\n\n【70】• Give anti-emetics, intravenous fluid and vitamins to those unable to tolerate oral \n\n【71】intake.\n\n【72】• Perform an ultrasound scan to rule out trophoblastic disease if before the 12 week \n\n【73】routine dating scan.\n\n【74】• Remember to give VTE thromboprophylaxis to those that are admitted into \n\n【75】hospital.http://taylorandfrancis.com305\n\n【76】", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The  ‘red spray’ that the patient used was glyceryl trinitrate (GTN). What is the \n\n【13】mechanism of action for this drug?\n\n【14】2. Why is the sublingual formulation of GTN favoured in acute angina?22\n\n【15】100 Cases in Clinical Pharmacology, Therapeutics and Prescribing\n\n【16】ANSWERS\n\n【17】1. GTN is a ‘nitric oxide donor’ drug that is commonly prescribed to treat symptoms of \n\n【18】ischaemic heart disease. Metabolism of GTN results in increased generation of nitric \n\n【19】oxide, which is a potent vasodilator. Nitric oxide increases cellular concentrations of \n\n【20】cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which subsequently initiates relaxation \n\n【21】of vascular smooth muscle cells. This promotes dilatation of the venous and arte￾rial systems and both the pre-load and after-load are thus reduced. Coronary artery \n\n【22】dilatation will additionally improve the delivery of oxygenated blood to the heart \n\n【23】during episodes of angina.\n\n【24】2. GTN is available in a variety of forms and is rapidly absorbed sublingually or via \n\n【25】the gastrointestinal tract. When taken orally, GTN undergoes extensive hepatic \n\n【26】first-pass metabolism, which greatly reduces its bioavailability. Sublingual GTN is \n\n【27】therefore preferable in acute events, as this provides a more potent effect. Sublingual \n\n【28】GTN can be delivered via either a spray or tablets; the tablets expire within 8 weeks \n\n【29】of opening the packet, however, and thus the spray is generally preferred. Peak drug \n\n【30】levels are achieved within 2 min of administration of sublingual GTN.\n\n【31】 GTN can be delivered via an intravenous infusion in a hospital setting  – this \n\n【32】allows medical staff to accurately titrate the dose to manage the balance of reducing \n\n【33】pre-load and after-load, whilst maintaining an adequate perfusing blood pressure. \n\n【34】GTN patches are also available, to provide a continuous background dose trans￾dermally. This is typically a low dose of GTN and is typically used in patients with \n\n【35】hypertension who are unable to tolerate oral medications.\n\n【36】 Of note, tolerance to GTN develops rapidly when it is used continually over a \n\n【37】number of hours, potentially due to the development of intracellular oxidative stress \n\n【38】and endothelial dysfunction. GTN patches may, therefore, need to be removed over￾night for 8 h to restore the patient’s physiological response to GTN, and similarly, \n\n【39】infusions of GTN may need to be intermittently stopped. Some studies suggest that \n\n【40】up to 50% of Asian people possess an inactive mutant form of a gene that produces \n\n【41】an enzyme involved in the production of nitric oxide in response to GTN and the \n\n【42】drug may therefore be less effective in this population.\n\n【43】Key Points\n\n【44】1. GTN is a ‘nitric oxide donor’ that increases dilation of both venous and arterial \n\n【45】blood vessels.\n\n【46】2. Tolerance to GTN can develop following ongoing exposure over a number of \n\n【47】hours and it thus becomes less effective over time when administered via a con￾tinuous infusion or topically via a patch.23\n\n【48】", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Vasopressin， or antidiuretic hormone (ADH)， is produced in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus. The neuron cell bodies in these nuclei have axons that descend into the median eminence， pituitary stalk， and then into the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland where ADH is stored. Plasma osmolality changes stimulate vasopressin release directly from the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei and indirectly from osmoreceptors in other hypothalamic nuclei. Volume-sensitive pathways can also regulate vasopressin release. Baroreceptors and mechanoreceptors in the aortic arch， carotid sinus， and right atrium can signal for vasopressin release in times of volume depletion.\n\n【11】Vasopressin stimulates aquaporin channels to open in the luminal membranes of the cortical and medullary collecting tubules of the kidney to promote water reabsorption.

It has three general functions： autonomic regulation， endocrine reg-ulation， and circadian regulation. The hypothalamus is comprised of three different zones. The periventricular zone， which borders the third ventricle， has neuroendo-crine functions. The medial zone， which is bound laterally by the fornix， functions in autonomic and neuroendocrine control of the enteric system. The lateral zone， which is bound medially by the fornix and laterally by the internal capsule， functions in autonomic and neuroendocrine control of the cardiovascular system. The circuitry of the hypothalamus is very complex， and many of its neuronal connec-tions are bidirectional. It sends and receives information via the blood stream-through the pituitary by way of the hypophyseal-portal system and through circum-ventricular organs， sites at which the blood-brain barrier is highly permeable and allows passage of chemical stimuli into the brain. The hypothalamus is the key brain site Tfohre the integration of multiple biological systems to maintain homeostasis.\n\n【27】These functions are executed by the various nuclei of the hypothalamus(Figure 28-1).\n\n【28】The paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei have already been discussed. The anterior nucleus is responsible for regulating the dissipation of heat from the body and stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system. A lesion will cause hyperthermia. The posterior nucleus regulates heat conservation and stimulates the sympathetic nervous system. A lesion will cause hypothermia. A lesion of the dorsomedial nucleus will result in “savage behavior.\"The ventromedial (VM) nucleus regulates satiety. A lesion in the VM nuclei will result in obesity and savage behavior. The preoptic nucleus is responsible for regulating gonadotropin release. The suprachi-asmatic nucleus controls circadian rhythms. A lesion will result in disruption of sleep-wake cycles. The lateral nucleus regulates the desire to eat. A lesion will result in starvation. The mamillary body receives input from the hippocampal formation by way of fibers in the fornix. Hemorrhagic lesions are found in the mamillary nuclei\n\n【29】Figure 28-1. Human hypothalamus， with a superimposed diagrammatic representation of the portal hypophyseal vessels.

The arcuate nucleus has axons projected back to the hypophyseal portal system， where they release dopamine to inhibit prolactin release from the anterior pituitary gland.\n\n【31】Many authors divide hypothalamic dysfunction into global and partial. In global dysfunction， many or all of the hypothalamic functions are deranged. Common causes are usually systemic in nature. Sarcoidosis， metastatic cancer， idiopathic inflammatory diseases， and germ cell cancers all may cause global hypothalamic dys-function. Partial hypothalamic dysfunction results when only one of the hormones is affected， as in the case of DI.\n\n【32】Syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) occurs when there is an unnecessary release of ADH. Common triggers include neurosurgi-cal procedures， head trauma， neoplasms， CNS infections， and autoimmune disorders like Guillain-Barre syndrome. Often the initial finding is dilutional hyponatremia without edema in the setting of low plasma osmolality and high urine specific grav-ity (>300 mOsm/L). Treatment is simple： free water restriction or， in the case of seizures secondary to hyponatremia， 3% sodium chloride with sodium correction no greater than 12 mEq/L in the first 24 hours and no greater than 20 mEq/L\n\n【33】in 48 hours. This avoids the debilitating sequela of central pontine demyelinolysis. Another common cause of hyponatremia in neurosurgical patients is cerebral salt wasting. In SIADH， in which the mechanism is excessive water that dilutes the sodium in the serum； in contrast， in cerebral wasting， there is a volume contraction because of salt loss in the urine. Thus， patients with cerebral salt wasting will have a suboptimal fluid balance and high levels of urine sodium， which is the opposite of SIADH patients. Thus， it is crucial to assess a patient’s volume status and urine sodium before instituting treatment. For example， fluid restriction in a patient with presumed SIADH could have detrimental effects on the renal， cardiovascular， and neurological systems of a patient who is actually volume-depleted in the setting of cerebral salt wasting.\n\n【34】Diabetes insipidus is a disease characterized by excretion of large amounts of highly diluted urine， which cannot be controlled by reducing fluid intake. It denotes inability of the kidney to concentrate urine. Diabetes insipidus is caused by a defi-ciency of vasopressin (also known as ADH)， or by an insensitivity of the kidneys to that hormone. The regulation of urine production occurs in the hypothalamus， which produces vasopressin in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei. After syn-thesis， the hormone is transported in neurosecretory granules down the axon of the hypothalamic neuron to the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland， where it is stored for later release. In addition， the hypothalamus regulates the sensation of thirst in the ventromedial nucleus by sensing increases in plasma osmolality and relaying this information to the cortex. The main effector organ for fluid homeostasis is the kid-ney. Antidiuretic hormone acts by increasing water permeability in the collecting ducts. Specifically， it acts on proteins called aquaporins which open to allow water into the collecting duct cells. This increase in permeability allows for reabsorption of water into the bloodstream， thus concentrating the urine.\n\n【35】**CASE CORRELATES**\n\n【36】●See Cases 28-36 (regulatory systems).\n", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "96e47d5b-02fc-4c12-a1df-025921e46136", "title": null, "text": "【0】Discussion on COVID-19\n======================\n\n【1】_Wensheng Qi_\n\n【2】### About the “ 疫 ” (Pestilence)\n\n【3】The Chinese character “ 疫 ” (yì, pestilence) is composed of “ 疒 ” (nè, sickness) and “ 殳 ” (shū, long pole). “ 殳 ” is a hieroglyph, symbolizing initially holding a sort of long-handled and hook-head apparatus. Then, it evolved to the meaning of weapon and reshaped into “ 役 ” (yì). The new character can denote “ 奴 役 ” (nú yì, enslavement), “ 兵役 ” (bīng yì, military service), “ 劳役 ” (láo yì, hard labor), etc., having the meaning of “to make human beings suffer”. “ 疫 ”, is actually formed by “ 疒 ” plus the “ 役 ” omitting the radical of “ 彳 ” (chì, weapon), signifying “to make human beings suffer from disease”. This kind of disease causing a multitude of suffering is named “ 疫病 ” (yì bìng, epidemic diseases), its characteristics concluded by the ancients as being “prone to spread wildly among people of all ages, causing similar symptoms”. Due to its sudden onset and rapid development, which can lead to sudden death, “ 疫 ” often combines with “ 疠 ” (lì, fierce disease) to express fierce epidemic disease or fierce pestilence. Some epidemics are called “ 瘟疫 ”(wēn yì, plagues), implying most of them have heat in nature.\n\n【4】### Discussion on “ 毒 ” (Toxin)\n\n【5】_Shuowen Jiezi_ , the ancient book also known as the _Origin of Chinese Characters_ , has mentioned that “toxin ( 毒 ) is from excessiveness and harmful grass”. It can be seen that the early “ 毒 ” (dú, toxin) refers to the wild grass that grows luxuriantly in crops and is harmful to people, but the deviation properties and toxicity of these weeds can correct the bias of the diseased body. So, “ 毒草 ” (dú cǎo, poisonous grass) refers to the medicinal herbs in fact. For example, _Huangdi Neijing_ , the _Inner Canon of Yellow Emperor_ , stated, “In high level toxicity treatment, cease the medication at level of six tenths health improvement; in general toxicity treatment, cease the medication at seven tenths health improvement.” On the contrary, “poisonous grass” can truly bring damage to a healthy organism. The so-called “harmful grass” is a “ 毒物 ” (dú wù, toxicant) in a sense, whose meaning is then extended to the pathogenic factors causing body damage, called “ 毒 ”.\n\n【6】As the pathogenic factor, “ 毒 ” has three connotations.\n\n【7】(1) Wang Bing notes in “ _Plain Questions_ — Chapter 70 — Five Elements Theory Rectification Essay” that “toxins are all the formidable violent Qi from the five elements”. The six exogenous pathogenic factors can turn into toxin, such as wind toxin, cold toxin, heat toxin, and dampness toxin.\n\n【8】(2) You Yi’s _Golden Chamber Heart Code_ states, “toxin is the accumulation of evil Qi that is hard to be removed from the body”. It means the accumulation of evil Qi (pathogenic factors) for a lengthy time can also form toxin inside the body, such as fire toxin, stasis toxin, phlegm toxin, and turbid toxin.\n\n【9】(3) Wu You-ke’s _Treatise on Plague Diseases_ points out, “plagues are not caused by pathogenic wind, pathogenic cold, summer-heat, nor pathogenic damp, but an exotic Qi from between heaven and earth (the nature).” In other words, there is in nature a pathogenic factor, which causes sudden onset of disease, rapid development, high infectivity, insidiousness, and certain specificity. Wu called it “miscellaneous Qi”, or “the harmful Qi of heaven and earth”, that is, pestilent toxin. The nature of the pestilent toxins varies and the resulting damages vary.\n\n【10】Pestilent toxin attacking the external meridian, skins, and flesh can lead to focal redness, swelling, heat and pain, spot rash, or ulceration. It invades into the internal Zang and Fu (viscera, including Five Viscera and Six Bowels), marrow, and brain, and to a large extent can cause severe conditions, like high fever and coma.\n\n【11】COVID-19 is a “dampness-plague”, and it is a “plague” first and foremost. The onset of illness is induced by toxin. This type of plague has a similar attribute to “dampness”, but it is not a “dampness evil” (dampness toxin) at all. Although the toxic nature of fire and heat is commonly seen in the COVID-19, as Yu Lin implies, “the pestilence is known as toxin, as explicit as fire also”, and pestilence is absolutely not limited to fire toxin and heat toxin. “Clearing heat detoxification” is not the only method to remove toxin. There are other ways including relaxing bowels and purgation detoxification, releasing the exterior with diaphoresis detoxification, invigorating blood and cooling the blood detoxification, and resolving phlegm and dispersing knots (coagulation) detoxification. Besides, there is a more specific “combat toxin with toxin” method, which involves application of toxic drugs including animal drugs She (snake) and Xie (scorpion), botanical drugs Ban Xia (Pinellia Ternata) and Tian Nan Xing (Rhizoma Arisaematis), and mineral drugs Xiong Huang (realgar) and Zhu Sha (cinnabar). As for the treatment of pestilence, as Yu Jia-yan said, “once the evil (Qi) enters the body, the first priority of treatment is expelling turbidity (toxin)”. The expelling turbidity detoxification of COVID-19 is a solution to cope with the dampness nature of this kind of pestilent toxin, which can be fulfilled by dispersing dampness using acrid herbs, resolving dampness using fragrant herbs, drying dampness using bitter herbs, or draining dampness using bland herbs.\n\n【12】### Note on “ 感冒 ” (Colds)\n\n【13】“ 感 ” (gǎn), a verb, means “feel” or “touch”; “ 冒 ” (mào), a verb, means “offend” or “suffer”. “ 感冒 ” (gǎn mào, Colds) forms a fixed phrase in Chinese, which is a noun, meaning feeling sick or being offended by the external evil Qi. Later, the meaning of the phrase narrowed, and it now means upper respiratory tract infection with viral nasopharyngitis as the main manifestation. In order to distinguish with influenza, “ 感冒 ” is also known as “common cold”, or “ 伤风 ” (shāng fōng, be hurt by wind/the sniffles) in terms of Chinese medicine.\n\n【14】The noun “common cold” was first used during the Song Dynasty: _Shengji Zonglu_ (the “General Records of Holy Universal Relief”) Volume 156, “ 妊娠感冒寒邪，藏于皮肤 (cold evil Qi that offends pregnant women, can hide under the skin)”; Volume 163, “ 产后气虚血弱，腠理开疏，感冒寒邪，传留肺经，则气道不利 (Postpartum women are deficient in Qi and blood, while their Cou Li (skin and muscular interstices) are open. If they are exposed to cold evil, it will invade their lung meridians, impeding the airway)”. “ 感冒 ” here is still used as a verb. In the Heji Jufang (the “Prescriptions of the Bureau of Taiping People’s Welfare Pharmacy”), under the introduction of Rensheng Yangrong formula, “ 大抵感冒，古人不敢轻发汗者 (ancient physicians dared not treat most of the colds by diaphoresis easily)”, “ 感冒 ” was used as the name of a disease for the first time.\n\n【15】Colds as exogenous febrile disease can be divided into three categories: seasonal cold, seasonal epidemic cold, and pestilent cold.\n\n【16】(1) Seasonal cold: People who do poorly in maintaining their health catch cold when they come across the six exogenous pathogenic factors of the four seasons. This is the pathogenesis of the seasonal cold, “common cold”, or “the sniffles” cold. The main cause of disease is human error (improper self-health care); the secondary cause is the change of external climate Qi (pathogenic factors).\n\n【17】(2) Seasonal epidemic cold: Chinese medicine believes it is caused by the “year-season discord”. It means the confusion of the time-qi relationship: “the time of season is not yet to come, but the corresponding climatic Qi has come; the time has come, but the Qi is absent; it is the time, while the Qi is exceeding; the time has come, but the previous Qi still stays.” In addition, people can have seasonal epidemic cold when affected by the epidemic Qi during an outbreak. Therefore, the disorder of climatic Qi and the presence of epidemic Qi are the main causes of the disease, and people feeling the cold becomes the secondary cause. One of the representative diseases is seasonal influenza. The cold is also named “seasonal pestilence”.\n\n【18】(3) Pestilent cold: The “ 天 ” (tiān, sky) is vast, hazy, mysterious, and unpredictable; “ 行 ” (xíng, walk) here means prevalence. As a result, the so-called “ 天行 ” (tiān xíng, sky prevalence) refers to a kind of furtive infectious diseases, which is unpredictable, hard to trace, offending people with no distinction between old and young, and has an instant onset. Examples are COVID-19, SARS, avian influenza, and so on. Two points can be explained as follows: ① “Sky prevalence” also has certain seasonal characteristics. For example, the three infectious diseases mentioned earlier occurred in the late winter and early spring periods. The relevant pestilent toxins of these plagues thus have characteristics of the seasonally climatic Qi of those periods. ② “Sky prevalence” is not impossible to prevent; “Plain Questions” Chapter “Cifa Lun (discussion on acupuncture methods)” has stated as much very objectively and comprehensively. First, it attaches importance to the infectivity of the “sky prevalence” plague: “the five pestilences are easy to infect people, regardless of the ages, and the disease conditions are similar”; second, it stresses the prevention of the “sky prevalence” plague. The first step to prevention is by virtue of appropriate protection measures, “to avoid toxin Qi (pathogenic Qi)”; the second step is “keeping sufficient healthy Qi so that the pathogenic Qi cannot invade the body”.\n\n【19】### Explanation of “ 膜原 ” (Moyuan)\n\n【20】The phrase “ 膜原 ” (mó yuán, interpleural-diaphramatic space) comes from _Plain Questions_ (a fascicle of _Huangdi Neijing_ ), Chapter Nue Lun (Discussion on Malaria): “Malaria attack once the other day is caused by pathogenic Qi that approaches to the Five-Zang organs and transversely reaches Muyuan ( 募原 ). Since the pathogenic Qi moves along a long route, penetrates deep inside and advances slowly, it cannot flow and emerge together with the Weiqi (defensive Qi). That is why it attacks once the other day”. Plain Questions, Chapter Jutong Lun (Discussion on Pains), also contains the following phrase: “retention of pathogenic cold between the intestines and the stomach and below Moyuan leads to stagnation of blood and contraction of small collaterals, resulting in pain. When pressed, blood and Qi disperse. That is why the pain stops when pressed.” Wang Bing notes that “‘ 膜 ’, is the membrane in between the thoracic cavity and diaphragm; ‘ 原 ’, is the field in between the heart and the diaphragm.” The Japanese Danboyuanjian interpreted “ 膜原 ” in “Plain Questions Knowledge”: “the membrane “ 膜 ” originally take the meaning of “ 幕 ”(mù, cover fabric of curtain) from “ 帷幕 ” (wéi mù, curtain/tent). It is a thin film among the membrane, covering on the diaphragm to block turbid Qi (evil Qi), like a cover fabric of curtain. So it is called “ 幕 ”, written as “ 膜 ” due to the radical of flesh.” “ 募 ” is the phonetic loan character to “ 膜 ”; they have the same meaning in “ 膜原 ” and “ 募原 ”.\n\n【21】The _Treatise on Plague Diseases_ of Wu Youke indicates that “after the evil enters through mouth and nose, it won’t stay at the inner Zang-Fu organs, nor the outer meridians. It will stay in a region which is anterior to the spine, not far from the exterior, near the stomach, and the boundary of exterior and interior. That is, the semi-exterior-interior (in between exterior and interior), or the ‘Moyuan’ recorded in the ‘Needle Classic’, which the evil transversely reaches. In terms of the location where evil stays, the meridian is considered exterior of the body, and stomach is considered interior of the body. Therefore, the Moyuan, being the connection of the meridian and stomach, is considered semi-exterior-interior of the body.” Since Wu cited the concept of “Moyuan” in Huangdi Neijing to explain the plague, the theory of Moyuan had attracted the attention of TCM physicians. By summarizing the opinions among experts of Traditional Chinese medicine, the Moyuan theory contains the following content:\n\n【22】(1) The site where evil stays: the Moyuan is located at the semi-exterior-interior, the junction of the inside and the outside, which is inside the defensive exterior (skin) and muscle striae (muscle), and outside the five Zang (Five Viscera) and six Fu (Six Bowels/six hollow organs). It can externally lead to the muscle striae, and internally approach the stomach-Fu organ. It is governed by the Hand-Shaoyang Meridian (Hand-Shaoyang Sanjiao Meridian). Moyuan is the crucial point and portal for the Sanjiao (triple jiaos in the body, including upper-jiao, middle-jiao, and lower-jiao).\n\n【23】(2) Physiology: Because the Moyuan is involved in many parts throughout the body (exterior and interior), the ancients believed that the Moyuan is related to the operation of the Sanjiao Qi movement. It is not only the way through which the external evil invades the body but also the path through which the body excretes internal evil. If the healthy Qi (vital energy) is weak, the external evil (pathogenic factor) will often enter through the Moyuan, and then invade the internal Zang-Fu viscera; if the healthy Qi is restored, the Qi will drum evil out through the Moyuan.\n\n【24】(3) Pathology: The “toxin incubating in Moyuan” syndrome emerges when turbid damp-heat enters the body through the nose and mouth and accumulates in the semi-exterior and semi-interior region where it grows resilient and very hard to resolve, combatting the healthy Qi, causing blockage of Qi and blood flow, and disruption of the Qi activity of the Sanjiao. It is a complex of syndromes involving the syndrome of intensive damp-heat accumulating in the middle-Jiao, as well as the Taiyang syndrome where pathogenic heat floats up, and the Shaoyang syndrome.\n\n【25】(4) Treatment difficulties: Neither diaphoresis for exterior syndromes nor purgation for interior syndromes can be used in treating the accumulation of turbid damp-heat. Eliminating the combination of dampness and heat is like extracting oil after mixing it with flour. Dampness cannot be resolved without the application of acrid herbs, but simply using acrid herbs could generate heat. Heat cannot be cleared without the application of bitter herbs, but simply using bitter herbs could generate dampness by interrupting the activity of the spleen and stomach. Therefore, the syndrome should not be treated merely by a single formula, a single method, or a single herb.\n\n【26】(5) Therapeutic principle: Expelling the evil is the general principle in treating the syndrome of “toxin incubating in Moyuan”. “ 开达膜原 ” (kāi dá mó yuán, dredging the Moyuan), “ 达原 ” (Dayuan) for short, is actually the treatment combining diffusing the upper-jiao, dredging the middle-jiao, and unblocking the lower-jiao. Harmonizing the Sanjiao is to smooth the Shaoyang Sanjiao Meridian Qi movement, thus promoting circulation and distribution of Qi and blood. Overall, the ultimate purpose of the treatment is to expel the evil, which can be achieved by either discharging the evil Qi internally through urination and defecation, or dispelling it externally through sweating.\n\n【27】(6) Treatment prescription: Dayuan Drink has the function of dispersing pathogens externally, promoting toxin excretion, and resolving turbid evil. In the formula, Bing Lang (arecae semen), Hou Po (magnoliae officinalis cortex), and Cao Guo (tsaoko fructus) are pungent and bitter in taste and warm in nature, which are capable of dispersing and descending, promoting Qi flow, and drying dampness. Bing Lang (arecae semen) can break the coagulations, dredging the channels and guiding Qi downward; Hou Po (magnoliae officinalis cortex) can break the coagulations and guide Qi downward, as well as dry dampness and resolve turbid evil; and Cao Guo (tsaoko fructus) has a strong pungent flavor, allowing it to outthrust and disperse the turbid toxin.\n\n【28】", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

He used three-point restraints and was driving a sedan. The driver of a pickup truck ran a stop sign while going at approximately 45 mi/h (mph) and broadsided (T-boned) the patient’s vehicle on the driver’s side. The patient has multiple injuries, including a displaced fracture of the left humerus.

He has motor and sensory losses to his left hand.\n\n【9】• Most likely diagnosis: Injury to the radial nerve as it spirals around the humerus, resulting in an inability to extend the wrist or fingers and loss of sensation of the hand\n\n【10】• Likely mechanism: Stretch or crush injury to the radial nerve as it spirals around the midshaft of the humerus\n\n【11】• Likely location of sensory deficit: Radial (lateral) side of the dorsum of the hand and dorsum of the thumb and index and middle digits\n\n【12】### CLINICAL CORRELATION\n\n【13】The radial nerve is at particular risk of injury in its course in the radial groove as it spirals around the midshaft of the humerus. Humeral fractures involving the midshaft region are of particular concern. There is loss of innervation of the posterior extensor muscles in the forearm, resulting in wrist drop and an inability to extend the digits at the metacarpophalangeal joints. The sensory loss on the dorsum of the hand and digits reflects the distal cutaneous distribution of the radial nerve. The triceps muscle (extensor of the elbow) is typically spared; however, fracture-related pain will usually prevent the patient from moving the limb. The deep brachial artery has the same path as the radial nerve in the radial groove and has a similar risk for injury.\n\n【14】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【15】#### The Radial Nerve\n\n【16】### OBJECTIVES\n\n【17】1\\. Be able to describe the origin, course, muscles innervated, and distal cutaneous regions supplied by the radial nerve\n\n【18】2\\. Be able to describe the arterial blood supply to the upper limb\n\n【19】3\\. Be able to describe the origin, course, muscles innervated, and distal cutaneous regions supplied by the five major terminal branches of the brachial plexus (see Cases 1 , 2 , and 4 )\n\n【20】### DEFINITIONS\n\n【21】FRACTURE: A break in the normal integrity of a bone or cartilage\n\n【22】BLUNT-FORCE TRAUMA: Injury due to a crushing force as opposed to a sharp penetrating force\n\n【23】### DISCUSSION\n\n【24】The radial nerve is a continuation of the posterior cord of the brachial plexus , and it reaches the posterior compartment of the arm by coursing around the radial groove of the humerus with the deep brachial artery ( Figure 2-1 ). It gives off multiple muscular branches to the triceps muscle in the posterior compartment. The nerve then pierces the lateral intermuscular septum to return to the anterior compartment of the arm and descends to the level of the lateral epicondyle of the humerus; at this level, it lies deep to the brachioradialis muscle, where it divides into its two terminal branches. The deep branch of the radial nerve is entirely motor to the muscles of the posterior compartment of the forearm . The other terminal branch, the superficial branch of the radial nerve, is sensory to the dorsum of the hand and to the dorsum of the thumb, index finger, and the radial side of the middle finger. The radial nerve also has cutaneous sensory branches to the posterior and lateral arm and to the posterior forearm.\n\n【25】Figure 2-1. The radial nerve. ( _Reproduced, with permission, from Waxman SG. Clinical Neuroanatomy, 25th ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2003:351_ .)\n\n【26】The blood supply to the upper limb is derived from the brachial artery , a direct continuation of the axillary artery . It begins at the lower border of the teres major muscle and accompanies the median nerve on the medial aspect of the humerus , where its pulsations can be palpated or the artery can be occluded to control hemorrhage. In its descent toward the elbow, it branches off the deep brachial artery, which supplies the posterior compartment of the arm, and passes around the radial groove of the humerus with the radial nerve. It also has ulnar collateral branches to the elbow joint . The brachial artery shifts anteriorly as it enters the forearm, lying just medial to the tendon of the biceps brachii muscle in the cubital fossa . At about the level of the neck of the radius, it divides into the ulnar and radial arteries, the main arteries of the forearm and hand. Near their origin, each sends recurrent arterial branches to supply the elbow joint.\n\n【27】The radial artery supplies the lateral aspects of the forearm and at the wrist passes dorsally (deep) through the anatomical snuffbox (see Case 3 ) to become the deep palmar arch. The ulnar artery is the larger branch of the brachial, and it supplies the medial aspect of the forearm. A branch close to its origin, the common interosseous artery, divides into anterior and posterior interosseous arteries. The latter artery is the main blood supply to the posterior compartment. At the wrist, the ulnar artery enters the hand to form the superficial palmar arch . The superficial and deep palmar arches form an arterial anastomosis and give rise to arteries to the digits.\n\n【28】(See also Case 1 .)\n\n【29】### ", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

He began to cough, expectorate with shortness of breath, and had fever since 02/04/2020 without an obvious reason. The sputum volume was small, white sticky sputum, and hard to cough up. Occasionally, there was blood in the sputum, with a body temperature (BT) of up to 38.6ºC, no muscle soreness, and fatigue. The laboratory tests on 02/08/2020 in the Tianhe Town Health Center, Huangpi District, Wuhan showed that the white blood cell (WBC) count was 6.61 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> cells/L, red blood cell (RBC) count was 5.17 × 10 <sup>12 </sup> cells/L, neutrophil (NEUT) count was 2.91 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> cells/L, and C-reactive protein (CRP) was 2.3 mg/L.

He was taking irbesartan hydrochlorothiazide 1 tablet a day, but the blood pressure (BP) level was unclear. He had a history of allergic rhinitis for more than 10 years which is related to seasonal allergy without systematic treatment. He had no history of exposure to the Huanan Seafood Market. None of the family members had pneumonia recently. He usually suffered from a rash after eating seafood.\n\n【14】### Patient’s Condition on Admission\n\n【15】The patient was fully conscious when he was admitted, with poor energy, shortness of breath aggravated when moving, pain in both temples, feeling unsteady while walking, dry and itchy throat, cough, a little white phlegm, no fever, poor sleep, less bloating and food, loose stools 2–3 times/day, and weight loss. The tongue was pale and fat, with teeth marks on the edges, and a thin yellowish-white coating (see Figure 2-17-2 ). The pulse was fast.\n\n【16】The physical examination revealed a BT of 36.8ºC, heart rate (HR) of 100 beats/min, respiratory rate (RR) of 20 breath/min, BP of 93/53 mmHg, and pulse oxygen saturation (SPO <sub>2 </sub> ) of 92% under ambient air; SPO <sub>2 </sub> was 99% while the patient was breathing supplement oxygen by nasal cannula at 5 L/min.\n\n【17】### Admission Diagnosis\n\n【18】① COVID-19 (severe type). ② Hypertension (grade 3).\n\n【19】Figure 2-17-2. Tongue manifestation on admission.\n\n【20】### Treatment Plan\n\n【21】The ward round record from the morning of 02/22/2020: The patient was fully conscious, had good energy, no fever, complained of shortness of breath that was aggravated when moving, had bilateral temple pain, dizziness, dry throat, cough, less white sputum, no bloody sputum phenomenon, poor sleep, and soft stools once a day. The tongue was pale and fat, with a thin white and yellowish coating. The pulse was fast. The results of the examination were as follows: HR was 100 beats/min; SPO <sub>2 </sub> was 92% under ambient air and 95% while the patient was breathing supplement oxygen by nasal cannula at 4 L/min. The laboratory tests reflected elevated WBC count (10.46 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L), NEUT count (5.25 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L), LYM count (4.32 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L), monocyte (MONO) count (0.88 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L), starch Sample A (82.5 mg/L), CRP (6.6 mg/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT, 142 U/L), aspartate aminotransferase (AST, 58 U/L), Interleukin 6 (IL-6) (7.21 pg/mL), with a reduced RBC count (4.22 × 10 <sup>12 </sup> /L), hemoglobin concentration (HB) (128 g/L), and eosinophils (EON) count (0.01 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L). Chest CT scan on 02/22/2020 showed pulmonary viral pneumonia, thickening and adhesion at the right pleura, increased and enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum and right armpit, and calcification at coronary arteries and aorta ( Figure 2-17-3 ).\n\n【22】Figure 2-17-3. Chest CT scan on 02/22.\n\n【23】_Note_ : Ground-glass and patchy shadows could be seen in the multilobe segments of both the lungs.\n\n【24】### Western Medicine Treatment Strategies\n\n【25】(1) The diagnosis was clear according to the medical history, symptoms (the main clinical symptoms of COVID-19 included fever, cough, and asthma), and laboratory tests (twice positive nucleic acid tests and ground-glass changes in chest CT).\n\n【26】(2) He was diagnosed as a severe type according to the Protocol for Diagnosis and Treatment of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (5th edition). The diagnostic criteria for severe are as follows: (1) shortness of breath, RR ≥ 30 times/min; (2) SPO <sub>2 </sub> ≤ 93% under ambient air; (3) arterial blood oxygen partial pressure/oxygen concentration ≤ 300 mmHg; (4) chest CT has more than 50% lesion progression within 24–48 hours. The SPO <sub>2 </sub> of the patient was almost 92–93% under ambient air at admission, which met the critical standard.\n\n【27】(3) The laboratory tests reflected elevated WBC and LYM count, with a normal NEUT count. Antibiotics were not involved in the treatment strategy, considering that the elevated WBC count may be caused by the improper drug use.\n\n【28】(4) The head CT scan was done due to dizziness.\n\n【29】### TCM Treatment Strategies\n\n【30】### _02/21/2020_\n\n【31】According to the primary symptoms (cough, low sputum amount, soft stools, pale tongue, a thin white and yellowish coating, the fast pulse, and history of spleen deficiency and dampness), it is consistent with the TCM pathogenesis of COVID-19. Treatment was mainly based on disease identification and a combination of disease and syndrome. We used Shenmai injection combined with xi yan ping injection intravenously to replenish Qi and nourish Yin while clearing away heat and detoxifying and anti-inflammation. Considering the patient’s spleen deficiency and excess dampness, Qi deficiency could not be transported, so the Chinese medicine No. 4 prescription was given to replenish Qi and strengthen the spleen and remove dampness. The formula was as follows:\n\n【32】_Fa Ban Xia (Pinelliae Rhizoma Preparatum) 9 g, Chen Pi (Citri Reticulate Pericarpium) 10 g, Dang Shen (Codonopsis Radix) 15 g, Zhi Huang Qi (roasted Astragali Radix) 30 g, Fu Ling (Poria) 15 g, Huo Xiang (Pogostemonis Herba) 10 g, Sha Ren (Amomi Fructus) 6 g (decocted later)._\n\n【33】Three doses of granules were given, 1 dose per day, to be taken in the morning and evening (02/22 to 02/24).\n\n【34】#### _02/24/2020_\n\n【35】On the 4th day of admission, the patient was diagnosed with dizziness, stiff neck discomfort, nausea, cough, phlegm in the pharynx and difficulty in coughing out, shortness of breath after activity, and insomnia. The tongue was dark and fat, with teeth marks on the tongue, and a thin and white coating. The pulse was slim and fast ( Figure 2-17-4 ). The SPO <sub>2 </sub> was 93% under ambient air and 97% while the patient was breathing supplement oxygen by nasal cannula at 2 L/min; HR was 100 beats/min. No abnormalities were reported in the head CT scan. Nucleic acid test (pharyngeal swab) turned negative. Although the inflammation area was not very large, there were still multi-leaf and multi-segment lesions. Some lesions were organizational and fibrotic, and the improvement of blood oxygen saturation was not ideal. The patient still had symptoms of wheezing and shortness of breath after activity, combined with the dark tongue, which was considered to be blood stasis. It was considered to be related to the impaired Qi and blood circulation caused by phlegm and dampness accumulated in the middle jiao. To avoid the development to the critical stage, we used Xue Bi Jing injection to promote blood circulation, remove blood stasis, dredge the Luo channels, and dispel poison.\n\n【36】Figure 2-17-4. The tongue was dark and fat, with teeth marks on the edge and the coating.\n\n【37】Considering the primary complaints were dizziness and neck discomfort, it was classified as dampness stagnating spleen, affecting the function of the spleen and disturbing clear Yang. To relieve those symptoms Ling Gui Zhu Gan decoction was used as the basic prescription to warm Yang Qi, promote blood circulation, remove dampness, and dredge the Luo channels. We added some heat-clearing and detoxifying medicines to remove the toxin.\n\n【38】_Fu Ling (Poria) 40 g, Gui Zhi (Cinnamomi Ramulus) 12 g, Chao Bai Zhu (stir-frying Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma) 12 g, Zhi Gan Cao (roasted Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma) 10 g, Ze Xie (Alismatis Rhizoma) 20 g, Ge Gen (Puerariae Lobatae Radix) 30 g, Dang Shen (Codonopsis Radix) 20 g, Jin Yin Huan (Lonicerae Japonicae Flos) 20 g, Guan Zhong (Dryopteris Crassirhizomae Rhizoma) 10 g, Hong Teng (Spatholobi Caulis) 20 g._\n\n【39】Five doses of granules were given, 1 dose per day, to be taken in the morning and evening (02/25 to 03/01).\n\n【40】The patient had severe insomnia, and was treated by embedding seeds at ear points, subcortex, shenmen, heart, sympathetic, spleen, stomach, and small intestine, to reinforce the heart and spleen, and nourish and calm the blood.\n\n【41】#### _02/26/2020_\n\n【42】The patient stated that the symptoms of dizziness improved after he took the medicine, the activity endurance was stronger than before, the cough symptoms were mild, and the sleep was improved. The tongue was pale and fat, with teeth marks on the edges, and a thin and white coating. The pulse was thin and fast. The SPO <sub>2 </sub> was 96% under ambient air and 98% while the patient was breathing supplement oxygen by nasal cannula at 2 L/min; HR was 92 beats/min. The nucleic acid tests of the pharyngeal swab, anal swab, and plasma were positive, negative, and negative, respectively. The laboratory tests reflected elevated WBC count (10.24 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L), LYM count (4.32 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L), MONO count (0.88 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L), CRP (3.9 mg/L), IL-6 (9.61 pg/mL), and ferroprotein (404.08 ng/mL), with a reduced RBC count (4.13 × 10 <sup>12 </sup> /L). Besides, the percentages of NEUT (44.0%), LYM (45.3%), and amyloid A (82.5 mg/L) were within the normal range. After taking Traditional Chinese medicine (CM) herbs, the symptoms were improved, SPO <sub>2 </sub> returned to normal, and inflammatory factors decreased, suggesting that the treatment was effective. However, the nucleic acid test of the pharyngeal swab was still positive, suggesting that treatment needed to be continued.\n\n【43】#### _03/01/2020_\n\n【44】The patient complained of shortness of breath, less sputum, foreign body sensation in the larynx, and a slight cough. The tongue was dull, with a thin and white coating. The pulse was thin and fast. Nucleic acid test (pharyngeal swab) on 02/29/2020 was positive. Lian Hua Qing Wen Capsule was used to inhibit the viral activity. Previous pharmacodynamic studies have confirmed that Lian Hua Qing Wen Capsule has an inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.\n\n【45】#### _03/02/2020_\n\n【46】The patient complained of shortness of breath, a little sputum, a foreign body sensation in the larynx, and cough. The symptoms of dizziness were alleviated as compared to before. The tongue was pale, with a thin and yellow coating. The pulse was thin and fast. The SPO <sub>2 </sub> was 98% under ambient air and HR was 92 beats/min. The nucleic acid test (pharyngeal swab) was positive; the re-examination of CT scan showed that the lung lesions were better absorbed than before ( Figure 2-17-5 ).\n\n【47】Figure 2-17-5. Chest CT scan on 03/02.\n\n【48】_Note_ : The absorption of both lung lesions was better than before.\n\n【49】#### _03/03/2020_\n\n【50】The shortness of breath and fullness of the head were significantly improved compared to before. After eating shrimp the previous night, a red rash appeared on the patient’s extremities and trunk ( Figure 2-17-6 ), with obvious itching. The patient did not inform the medical staff to apply Bing Huang Fu Le Ointment. However, the symptoms did not improve, and sleep was affected. The tongue was pale and had teeth marks on the edges, with a greasy white coating, and slippery pulse ( Figure 2-17-7 ). The next day, loratadine tablets were used for anti-allergy, and Xiao Feng San was used to remove wind and dampness, clear heat, and nourish the blood.\n\n【51】Figure 2-17-6.

The tongue was dark, with teeth mark on the edges, and a thin white and delicate coating. The pulse was thin and fast. The SPO <sub>2 </sub> was 97% under ambient air and HR was 102 beats/min. We performed a nucleic acid test again (anal swab or stools, pharyngeal swab, sputum, blood), in which the pharyngeal swab and sputum were still positive. The laboratory tests reflected elevated LYM count (3.27 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L), ESR (25 mm/h), CRP (1.2 mg/L), IL-6 (8.93 pg/mL), and ferroprotein (360.54 ng/mL), with a reduced RBC count (4.13 × 10 <sup>12 </sup> /L) and HB (125 g/L). Also, WBC count (7.41 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L), percentage of NEUT (44.0%), percentage of LYM (45.3%), and amyloid A (82.5 mg/L) were within the normal range. These tests showed an improvement in inflammatory factors.\n\n【57】#### _03/08/2020_\n\n【58】The patient had a clear mind and good energy, complained of dry cough, a foreign body sensation in the pharynx, and a sense of gas channeling in the chest and flank, but the other symptoms were improved. He could sleep well, but had loose stools. The tongue was pale and enlarged, with teeth marks on the edges, and a thin, white, and a little greasy coating ( Figure 2-17-8 ). The pulse was thin. Those symptoms were considered to be phlegm and Qi blocking. We adjusted the decoction to use Xiao Chai Hu decoction and Ban Xia Hou Pu decoction as the main prescription, adding some herbs to circulate Qi and blood.\n\n【59】Figure 2-17-8.

The tongue was pale, the tongue body was narrower than the front, with slight teeth marks on the edges, and a thin white coating and a few cracks could be seen in the middle of the tongue ( Figure 2-17-9 ). His pulse was thin. Considering that the patient has repeatedly tested positive for sputum virus, and currently has residual toxin, Qi, and Jin damage, we adjusted the treatment plan to take Si Miao Yong An decoction as the main prescription to support Qi and remove residual toxin.\n\n【64】Figure 2-17-9.

Serum IgG and IgM antibodies were positive. Blood, throat swab, sputum, and anal swab nucleic acid tests were negative. Inflammatory factors returned to normal. Considering that previous nucleic acid tests had changed from negative to positive, we conducted two nucleic acid retests, especially sputum samples. Pharyngeal swab and sputum nucleic acid tests on 03/22/2020 were negative. Blood, pharyngeal swab, sputum, and anal swab nucleic acid tests on 03/23/2020 were negative. On 03/25/2020, the patient felt better and had no special discomfort symptoms. The tongue was fat and large, with teeth marks on the edges, and a white and a little greasy coating ( Figure 2-17-10 ). His pulse was thin. A Chest CT scan showed the absorption of both lung lesions ( Figure 2-17-11 ). Considering that he complied with the discharge criteria, we then allow him to be discharged. According to the deficiency of spleen and lung Qi at the time of discharge, we gave him Granule No. 4 and dangshen oral liquid to invigorate Qi, strengthen the spleen and lungs, and enhance immunity.\n\n【69】Figure 2-17-10.

Abnormal liver and kidney function gradually dropped to a normal level after stopping Western medicine ( Figure 2-17-13 ).\n\n【77】5\\. CT scan before admission showed a diffuse lung lesion, mainly manifested by consolidation and ground glass. After treatment with CM, only few cable shadows were left in the CT before discharge (see Figures 2-17-1 , 2-17-3 , 2-17-5 and 2-17-11 ).\n\n【78】### Patient’s Conditions at Discharge\n\n【79】On the 5th day after admission, the symptoms of cough and shortness of breath were alleviated, and SPO <sub>2 </sub> under ambient air returned to normal. Three multi-site nucleic acid tests were negative. Serum inflammatory markers returned to normal, and chest CT showed obvious absorption of inflammation, indicating that the patient’s condition had improved. The patient was discharged on March 26. After discharge, he continued to take TCM granule No. 4 and was followed up by telephone.\n\n【80】Figure 2-17-12. Changes in SpO2.\n\n【81】Table 2-17-1. Changes of inflammation factors.\n\n【82】Figure 2-17-13. Changes in liver and kidney function.\n\n【83】### Case Analysis\n\n【84】(1) Except for oxygen therapy, the other treatments belong to TCM.\n\n【85】(2) The main feature of this case is that the nucleic acid test continued to be positive, especially sputum. At present, it is believed that persistent nucleic acid positivity is associated with a high early viral load in patients. Besides, the immunity, age, and underlying diseases also contributed, leading to delayed virus clearance. For this patient, it is considered that the long-term use of steroids before admission led to poor virus clearance. The patient’s constitution belonged to the spleen-deficiency and phlegm-dampness type; the characteristic of dampness are sticky and stagnant, which could easily lead to the prolongation of the disease.\n\n【86】(3) After admission, the TCM treatment strategy focused on improving clinical symptoms that did not deviate from the fundamentals. The prescriptions used included Xiang Sha Liu Jun Zi decoction, Ling Gui Zhu Gan decoction, Ban Xia Hou Pu decoction, Xiao Chai Hu decoction, and Xiao Feng San. The treatment strategy changed according to the symptoms and condition of the patient.\n\n【87】(4) After the symptoms improved, the primary problem was that the nucleic acid test continued to be positive. We adjusted the treatment strategy in time and then used Si Miao Yong An decoction. The prescription involved few herbs but concentrated effects. In ancient China, it was used to treat gangrene caused by heat toxins. However, the clinical application of this prescription is extensive today, which reflects the characteristics of TCM syndrome differentiation and treatment. The prescription can supplement Qi while removing toxins. Based on this prescription, we added herbs, such as reed root, almond, and melon, to clear the lungs, and also added heat-clearing and detoxifying herbs, such as red vine and sapodilla, to promote the dissipation of toxin so that the nucleic acid detection quickly turned negative.\n\n【88】(5) After admission, all hormones, antibiotics, and antiviral drugs were given up; only TCM was used. The liver and kidney function improved to normal.\n\n【89】(6) After TCM treatment, serum amyloid A, CRP, and serum ferritin protein, which were markedly elevated in the early stages, recovered significantly ( Table 2-17-1 ), suggesting that TCM had a definite anti-inflammatory effect.\n\n【90】(Hao Li, Guoju Dong, Bing Wang, Nanyang Liu)", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

She made this attempt shortly after a party she attended the previous weekend. At this party， she reportedly argued with her best friend and left very angry. Her history at admission shows a several-month history of irritability， worsening performance in school， poor sleep， anhedonia， anergia， and isolation from her family and friends.Her discharge summary has an admitting diagnosis of major depression for which she was started on fluoxetine(Prozac). She sees you 2 weeks after her 3-day hospitalization and is quite cheery， energetic， and happy. She reports no problems and dismisses her earlier suicide attempt as a childish act to get attention. She reports that the staff at the hospital were absolutely wonderful and helped her solve all her problems. She says that she was so impressed with them that she has decided to go into psychiatry herself so she can help others. Later， while meeting with the parents， they report that at home she is sleeping well and appears in a good mood. Nevertheless， they are concerned because they also report that she is worried about whether there were cameras in the doctor's office that were recording her. She also reports that she believes she is being stalked by several of the boys at her school.\n\n【1】What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【2】What is the best therapy for this condition?\n\n【3】Should this patient be hospitalized?\n\n【4】Summary： A 15-year-old girl presents to the office with\n\n【5】● _。A_ A diagnosis of major depression with a recent suicide attempt\n\n【6】Seemingly good response to treatment for major depression\n\n【7】**Evidence of paranoia still present after mood symptoms have resolved**\n\n【8】Most likely diagnosis： Schizoaffective disorder.\n\n【9】Best therapy： An antipsychotic agent (such as haloperidol or risperidone) should be tried initially. Antidepressants should be administered when a patient develops another depressive episode； a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) is gen-erally tried first. For the patient in the case above， the fluoxetine should be contin-ued for at least 6 months after remission of mood symptoms.\n\n【10】Is hospitalization needed： No. The patient is currently not a danger to herself or others and appears to be able to care for herself. This patient as presented here should be treated in an outpatient setting unless the suicidal ideation returns and/or worsens.\n\n【11】_Objectives_\n\n【12】1\\. Recognize schizoaffective disorder in a patient and diagnose it accurately.(EPA 1，2)\n\n【13】2\\. Know that the disease has two subtypes： depressive and bipolar. (EPA 2，12)\n\n【14】3\\. Know the recommended pharmacologic treatment for this disorder.(EPA 4)\n\n【15】4\\. Know the indications for hospitalization of a patient with this disorder.(EPA 4，10)\n\n【16】**_Considerations_**\n\n【17】This 15-year-old patient has a several-month history of what sounds like mood(depressive) symptoms， which seem to have remitted with fluoxetine. However， there is evidence of a paranoid delusion (believing there are cameras in the doctor’s office recording her) that persists without mood symptoms. Although the patient was not asked about manic symptoms， the presence of such symptoms is a crucial element in the patient’s history because it changes the subtype of schizoaffective disorder from depressive type to bipolar type and， in turn， affects the pharmaco-logic treatment choices. Without these symptoms， the patient's disorder would be characterized as depressive type.\n\n【18】**APPROACHTO：**\n\n【19】**Schizoaffective Disorder**\n\n【20】**DEFINITIONS**\n\n【21】**ANERGIA： Lack of energy.**\n\n【22】ANHEDONIA： Lack of interest in one's usual pleasure-seeking activities， such as hobbies.\n\n【23】TANGENTIAL SPEECH (TANGENTIALITY)： A disorder of thought process in which one's thoughts\"take off on a tangent\"from the initial question or line of thought and do not return to the original line of thinking.\n\n【24】**CLINICAL APPROACH**\n\n【25】_Pathophysiology_\n\n【26】**The key to the diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder is that a patient has at least2 weeks of psychotic episodes without mood symptoms and also episodes of mood symptoms without psychosis. See Table 5-1、**\n\n【27】Studies have also shown brain matter abnormalities in patients with schizophre-nia and schizoaffective disorder. One study confirmed， through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)， the presence of white matter pathology early in the course of these illnesses. These data support the hypotheses of frontotemporal dysfunction and abnormalities in left-hemisphere lateralization in the pathophysiology of these ill-nesses. Some studies have demonstrated a more substantial degree of general psycho-pathology in younger patients with schizoaffective disorder as compared to adults.\n\n【28】_Differential Diagnosis_\n\n【29】The key to developing a differential diagnosis for schizoaffective disorder is to care-fully examine the longitudinal functioning of patients by reviewing their histories(provided by the patients and ideally by significant others). Periods of psychosis， as well as periods of psychosis with mood symptoms (mania and/or depression)， must be carefully teased out over a time period of years， if possible. Conditions caus-ing substance-induced mood disorder (which can be difficult to differentiate from schizoaffective disorder) include cocaine， methamphetamine， K2/Spice (a synthetic cannabinoid)， bath salts or amphetamine intoxication (manic symptoms)， cocaine\n\n【30】| Table 5-1·DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR SCHIZOAFFECTIVE DISORDER  |\n| --- |\n| Patients must exhibit psychotic symptoms consistent with the acute phase of schizophrenia.Psychotic symptoms must be accompanied by prominent mood symptoms (mania or depression)during part of the illness. At other points in the illness， the psychotic symptoms must be unopposed； that is， no moodsymptoms are present. Periods of illness in which there are only psychotic symptoms， and nomood symptoms， must last for at least 2 weeks. The disorder cannot be caused by a substance or by another medical condition.  |\n\n【31】withdrawal (depressive symptoms)，and the effects of a host of prescribed medications including steroids and antiparkinsonian medications. The symptoms of schizophrenia can appear similar， but the mood symptoms sometimes present in that disorder are generally transient and are brief in relation to the total length of the illness. Patients with bipolar disorder generally have mood symptoms (eg， euphoria， irritability) pre-dating development of the psychoses， as have patients with major depression with psychotic features (a depressed mood predating the onset of psychosis).\n\n【32】**_Ireatment_**\n\n【33】**Antipsycbotic Agents. Patients with schizoaffective disorder generally respond to antipsychotic agents and often require long-term therapy. Although haloperidol(Haldol) and typical antipsychotics were once the treatments of choice (indeed， the only options available)， newer atypical (second-generation) antipsychotics are now used far more frequently because of their more benign， short-term side-effect profile. These medications are not known to cause tardive dyskinesia， most extrapyra-midal symptoms， or neuroleptic malignant syndrome. They are likely well tolerated because they also produce fewer anticholinergic side effects.**\n\n【34】Second generation antipsychotics do， however， have significant long-term side effects that must be monitored. These include weight gain， insulin resistance， and hyperlipidemia. There is little good evidence that second-generation antipsychot-ics are better than first generation in terms of efficacy. Both typical and atypical antipsychotic medications have approximately the same duration of action， making once or twice per day dosing feasible in both cases.\n\n【35】Mood Stabilizers. Mood stabilizers such as lithium， carbamazepine， and valproic acid should be administered to patients with schizoaffective disorder who exhibit manic symptoms (bipolar type of schizoaffective disorder). It is sometimes helpful _1_ to combine an antidepressant and an antipsychotic for patients with schizoaffective disorder with a depressed mood. However， such patients should be treated with an antidepressant in addition to their antipsychotic only if the antipsychotic alone does not ameliorate the mood symptoms.\n\n【36】Other Treatments. Other treatment modalities can include hospitalization， par-ticularly when patients are psychotic and unable to care for themselves or suicidal. Psychosocial rehabilitation， such as is used in the treatment of schizophrenia， is often indicated as well because these patients can suffer from the same social iso-lation， apathy， and disturbed interpersonal relationships that schizophrenics do， although usually not with the same degree of severity.\n\n【37】Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has more recently shown some utility in the management of psychotic symptoms in both schizophrenic and schizoaffec-tive patients. However， this treatment is still considered experimental and is not yet frequently used. ECT， however， has proven efficacy in treating both the depression and the psychosis for people with schizoaffective disorder who are not responding or suboptimally responding to oral therapies.\n", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

She reports feeling “dizzy”on and off for the past year； the dizziness is associated with weakness that has been worsening for the past month. She has been feeling ‘too tired\"to even walk to her backyard and water her flower bed that she used to do“all the time.She has been so dyspneic walking up the stairs at her home that she moved downstairs to the guest room about a weekago.Reviewofsystems is signif-icant for knee pain， for which she frequently takes aspirin or ibuprofen； otherwise the review of systems is negative. She has no significant medical history and has not been to a doctor in several years. She had a normal well-woman examination and screening colonoscopy about 5 years ago. She occasionally has an alcoholic drink and denies tobacco or drug use. She is married and is a retired shopkeeper. On examination， her blood pressure is 150/85 mm Hg； her pulse is 98 beats/min； her respiratory rate is 20 breaths/min； her temperature is 98.7F(37.1℃)； and her oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Significant findings on examination include conjunctival pallor， mild tenderness with deep palpation in the epigastric and left upper quadrant (LUQ)region ofthe abdomen with normal bowel sounds， and no organomegaly but a positive stool guaiac test. The remainder ofthe examination， including respiratory， cardiovascular， and nervous systems， was normal.**\n\n【2】**What is the most likely diagnosis?**\n\n【3】**What is your next diagnostic step?**\n\n【4】**What is the next step in therapy?**\n\n【5】**ANSWERS TO CASE9：**\n\n【6】**Summary： A 65-year-old woman with worsening dyspnea on exertion， fatigue， dizziness， and palpitations. She is found to have conjunctival pallor and guaiac-positive stool.**\n\n【7】**Most likely diagnosis： Anemia secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding； other considerations should include new-onset angina， congestive heart failure， and atrial fibrillation.**\n\n【8】**Next diagnostic step： A complete blood count (CBC) to evaluate for the ane-mia. To evaluate for the other conditions on your differential diagnosis list， you should perform an electrocardiogram (ECG) and cardiac enzymes. A prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) to look for coagulation abnormalities would be helpful as well.**\n\n【9】**Next step in therapy： Further workup， including blood transfusion (if needed)， completion of two more sets of cardiac enzymes， and ECGs. A gastroenter-ology consult for esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy is appropriate because of the positive guaiac findings.**\n\n【10】Objectives\n\n【11】**1\\. Know a diagnostic approach to anemia in geriatrics.**\n\n【12】2\\. Be familiar with a rational workup for anemia of different origins.\n\n【13】**Considerations**\n\n【14】**A 65-year-old woman who has developed worsening dyspnea and palpitations over1-week period of time needs to be evaluated for cardiac and respiratory problems despite the gradual onset of symptoms. Specifically， in a postmenopausal woman， signs and symptoms of angina or acute myocardial infarction may not always have a typical presentation. That the patient has been feeling weak and has conjunctival pallor warrants testing for anemia. As evaluation with serial cardiac enzymes and ECGs is part of the workup， admission into the hospital is appropriate.**\n\n【15】**Assuming that the initial workup for cardiac and pulmonary causes is negative and that the hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are low， a thorough evaluation for the cause of the anemia is necessary. A CBC with peripheral smear， reticulocyte count， iron studies， vitamin B，，and folic acid levels would provide clues to the type of anemia that this patient has. A gastroenterology consult for possible EGD and colonoscopy to further investigate the source of gastrointestinal bleeding should be considered. The presence of epigastric and LUQ pain， along with long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)， should also raise a flag for test-ing to rule out a bleeding ulcer.**\n\n【16】**The presence of other findings may direct your workup toward other diagnoses. If this patient was from a developing country， the possibility of intestinal parasites would need to be considered. If the PT and PTT were abnormal， gastrointestinal(GI) bleeding from a coagulopathy or liver disease would be possibilities. Weight loss， lymphadenopathy， and coagulopathy may warrant evaluation for nongastroin-testinal malignancies， such as leukemias or lymphomas. In younger patients， sickle cell disease， thalassemias， glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency， and other inherited causes of anemia would be on the differential diagnosis list. These are unlikely to manifest as an initial diagnosis at the age of 65.**\n\n【17】**APPROACHTO：**\n\n【18】**Anemia in Geriatric Population**\n\n【19】**DEFINITIONS**\n\n【20】**ANEMIA： According to the World Health Organization (WHO)， a hemoglobin level of less than 12 g/ dL in women and less than 14 g/ dL in men.**\n\n【21】**NHANES： The National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys.**\n\n【22】**CLINICAL APPROACH**\n\n【23】Epidemiology\n\n【24】**The prevalence of anemia in Americans older than 65 years is estimated at 9% to45%.There is a wide variation in the rates of anemia in different ethnic and racial groups， with NHANES data showing the highest rates in non-Hispanic blacks and lowest rates in non-Hispanic whites. These differences are reportedly a result of biologic， not socioeconomic， differences. Most studies show the rate of anemia to be higher in men than women and there is increasing evidence for anemia as an independent risk factor for increased morbidity and mortality and decreased qual-ity of life (Level B recommendation).**\n\n【25】**ClinicalPresentation**\n\n【26】**Fatigue， weakness， and dyspnea are symptoms that are commonly reported by elderly persons with anemia. These vague and nonspecific symptoms are often ignored by both patients and physicians as symptoms of \"old age” Anemia may result in worsening of symptoms of other underlying conditions. For example， the reduced oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood as a consequence of anemia may exacerbate dyspnea associated with congestive heart failure.**\n\n【27】**Certain signs found on examination may prompt a workup for anemia. Conjunc-tival pallor is recommended as a reliable sign of anemia in the elderly and commonly noted in patients with hemoglobin less than 9 g/dL. Other signs may suggest a spe-cific cause of anemia. Glossitis， decreased vibratory and positional senses， ataxia， paresthesia， confusion， dementia， and pearly gray hair at an early age are signs sug-gestive of vitamin B.，-deficiency anemia. Folate deficiency can cause similar signs，**\n\n【28】**except for the neurologic deficits. Profound iron deficiency may produce koilony-chias (spoon nails)， glossitis， or dysphagia. Other clinical manifestations of ane-mia include jaundice and splenomegaly. Jaundice can be a clue that hemolysis is a contributing factor to the anemia， whereas splenomegaly can indicate that a thalas-semia or neoplasm may be present.**\n\n【29】**Initial workup of anemia should include a CBC with measurement of red blood cell(RBC) indices， a peripheral blood smear， and a reticulocyte count. Further laboratory studies would be indicated based on the results of the initial tests and the presence of symptoms or signs suggestive of other diseases.**\n\n【30】**The most common cause of anemia with a low mean corpuscular volume(MCV)， microcytic anemia， is iron deficiency. Iron deficiency could be confirmed by subsequent testing that shows a low serum iron， low ferritin， and high total iron-binding capacity (TIBC). Other causes of microcytic anemia include thalassemias and anemia of chronic disease. In the elderly， iron deficiency is frequently caused by chronic gastrointestinal blood loss， poor nutritional intake， or a bleeding disorder. A thorough evaluation of the gastrointestinal tract for a source of blood loss，usu-ally requiring a gastroenterology consultation for upper and lower GI endoscopy， should be undertaken， as iron-deficiency anemia may be the initial presentation of a GI malignancy.**\n\n【31】Anemia with an elevated MCV， macrocytic anemia， is most often a manifes-tation of folate or vitamin B.， deficiency； other causes include drug effects， liver disease， and hypothyroidism. The presence of macrocytic anemia， with or without the symptoms previously mentioned， should lead to further testing to determine B.， and folate levels. An elevated methylmalonic acid (MMA) level can be used to confirm a vitamin B， deficiency；an elevated homocysteine level can be used to con-firm folate deficiency. Folate deficiency anemia is usually seen in alcoholics， whereas B ，-deficiency anemia mostly occurs in people with pernicious anemia， a history of gastrectomy， and diseases associated with malabsorption (eg， bacterial infection， Crohn disease， celiac disease). Under normal conditions， the body stores 50% of its B， (2-5 mg total in adults) in the liver for 3 to 5 years. A minimal amount of B， is lost daily through gastrointestinal secretions. B， deficiency anemia is rare but possible in long-term vegans and vegetarians. B， deficiency can be distinguished clinically from folic acid deficiency by the presence of neurologic symptoms.\n\n【32】**In the elderly， anemia of chronic inflammation (formerly known as anemia of chronic disease) is the most common cause of a normocytic anemia. Anemia of chronic inflammation is anemia that is secondary to some other underlying condi-tion that leads to increased inflammation and bone marrow suppression. Along with causing a normocytic anemia， anemia of chronic inflammation can also present as a microcytic anemia. This type of anemia can easily be confused with iron-deficiency anemia because of its similar initial laboratory picture. In anemia of chronic inflam-mation， the body's iron stores (measured by serum ferritin) are normal， but the capa-bility of using the stored iron in the reticuloendothelial system becomes decreased. A lack of improvement in symptoms and hemoglobin level with iron supplementa-tion are important clues indicating that the cause is chronic disease and not iron depletion，regardless of the laboratory picture. Another cause of normocytic ane-mia is renal insufficiency due to decreased erythropoietin production. Although**\n\n【33】**Table 9-1·LABORATORY VALUES DIFFERENTIATING IRON-DEFICIENCY**\n\n【34】| **Table 9-1·LABORATORY VALUES DIFFERENTIATING IRON-DEFICIENCYANEMIA FROMANEMIA OF CHRONICINFLAMMATION**  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Test**  | **Iron Deficiency**  | **Anemia ofChronic Inflammation**  |\n| **Serum iron**  | **Low**  | **Low or normal**  |\n| **TIBC**  | **High**  | **Low**  |\n| **Transferrin saturation**  | **Low**  | **Low or normal**  |\n| **Serum ferritin**  | **Low**  | **Normal or high**  |\n\n【35】bone marrow iron store remains the gold standard to differentiate between iron-deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic disease， simple serum testing is still used to diagnose and differentiate these two types of anemia (Table 9-1).\n\n【36】**Treatment**\n\n【37】**The treatment of anemia is determined based on the type and cause of the anemia.**\n\n【38】Any cause of anemia that creates a hemodynamic instability can be treated with a red blood cell transfusion. A hemoglobin less than 7 g/dL is a commonly used threshold for transfusion； however， transfusion may be indicated at higher levels if the patient is symptomatic or has a comorbid condition such as coronary artery disease. Iron-deficiency anemia is treated first by identification and correction of any source of blood loss. Most iron deficiency can be corrected by oral iron replace-ment. Oral iron is given as ferrous sulfate 325 mg (contains 65 mg of elemental iron) three times a day. In uncomplicated anemia， it is considered first-line therapy given its low cost and easy accessibility. Adherence to oral iron may be poor due to gastrointestinal side effects (dark stools， nausea， vomiting， and constipation) and the required 6 to 8 weeks of treatment needed to correct the anemia. Individuals with malabsorptive conditions， malignancy， chronic kidney disease， heart failure， or significant blood loss may not benefit from oral iron replacement and there-fore require parenteral iron preparations. It is recommended that patients requir-ing parenteral administration be given iron intravenously and not intramuscular(IM). Given the high risk of side effects， only trained clinicians should administer intravenous iron.\n\n【39】**Vitamin B， deficiency traditionally has been treated by intramuscular B，ther-apy with a regimen of 1000 pg IM daily for 7 days， then weekly for 4 weeks， then monthly for the rest of the patient s life. Newer research shows that many patients can be successfully treated with oral B， therapy using 1000 to 2000 ug PO in a similar regimen. Folate deficiency can be treated with oral therapy of 1 mg daily until the deficiency is corrected.**\n\n【40】**Anemia of chronic inflammation is managed primarily by treatment of the underlying condition in order to decrease inflammation and bone marrow suppres-sion. When anemia of chronic inflammation is severe (hemoglobin<10 g/dL)， the risks and benefits of two modalities of treatment， blood transfusion and erythro-poiesis-stimulating agents， may be considered. To note， the goals of treatment of anemia of chronic inflammation in patients with chronic kidney disease undergo-ing dialysis are to maintain a hemoglobin level between 10 and 12 g/dL； higher**\n\n【41】**hemoglobin levels in this patient population are associated with increased rates of death and cardiovascular events.**\n", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

She has had headaches since she was a teenager, but they have become more debilitating recently. The episodes occur once or twice each month and last for up to 2 days. The pain begins in the right temple or at the back of the right eye and spreads to the entire scalp over a few hours. She describes the pain as a sharp, throbbing sensation that gradually worsens and is associated with severe nausea. Several factors aggravate the pain, including loud noises and movement. She has taken several over-the-counter medications for the pain, but the only thing that works is going to sleep in a quiet, darkened room. A thorough history reveals that her mother suffers from migraine headaches. Her vital signs, general physical examination, and a thorough neurologic examination are all within normal limits.\n\n【3】 What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【4】 What imaging study is most appropriate at this time?\n\n【5】 What are the most appropriate therapeutic options?\n\n【6】### ANSWERS TO CASE 34:  \nMigraine Headache\n\n【7】_Summary:_ A 33-year-old woman presents with headaches that are throbbing and over her right eye.

Know the differential diagnosis of chronic headache.\n\n【14】2\\. Learn the “red flag” symptoms and signs that should prompt rapid, specific diagnostic and treatment interventions.\n\n【15】3\\. Know how to manage common headache syndromes.\n\n【16】#### _Considerations_\n\n【17】The patient described in the case has symptoms that are very characteristic of classic migraines without aura. Her headaches are unilateral, throbbing in nature, and have been progressively worse. Migraine headaches are the most common headaches of vascular origin. They typically cause recurrent episodes of headache, nausea, and vomiting. They can also be associated with other neurologic symptoms such as photo-phobia, light-headedness, paresthesia, vertigo, and visual disturbances. In the patient described in this case, the history and lack of physical findings can reasonably lead to the diagnosis of migraine headaches without aura (“common migraine”), the most frequently occurring form. Other classifications of migraines include migraine with aura (“classic migraine”), ophthalmoplegic migraine, retinal migraine, and childhood periodic syndromes that may be precursors to or associated with migraines. During the evaluation of this patient, the focus should be on determining the etiology of the headache, assessing for any red flags ( Table 34–1 ) that may indicate a worse pathologic causes, identifying triggers, and therapy for the condition.\n\n【18】Table 34–1 • “RED FLAG” SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS IN THE EVALUATION OF HEADACHES\n\n【19】According to the International Headache Society, symptoms diagnostic of migraine headache include moderate to severe headache with a pulsating quality; unilateral location; nausea and/or vomiting; photophobia; phonophobia; worsening with activity; multiple attacks lasting for 4 hours to 3 days; and absence of history or physical examination findings that would make it likely that the headache is the result of another cause. Common triggers of migraine headaches include menses, fatigue, hunger, and stress.\n\n【20】### APPROACH TO:  \nMigraine Headaches\n\n【21】### DEFINITIONS\n\n【22】MIGRAINE HEADACHES: Vascular headaches typically throbbing unilateral in character, and may be present with or without an aura. There is a high female predominance.\n\n【23】TENSION HEADACHE: Typically presenting with pericranial muscle tenderness and a description of a bilateral bandlike distribution of the pain.\n\n【24】CLUSTER HEADACHE: Unilateral headaches that may have a high male predominance, can be located in the orbital, supraorbital, or temporal region. It is generally described as a deep, excruciating pain lasting from 15 minutes to 3 hours. These headaches are usually episodic; however, a small subset may have chronic headaches.\n\n【25】### CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【26】Headaches are an extremely common complaint in primary care, urgent care, and emergency settings. The vast majority of adults have at least one headache each year, although most do not present for medical care. The role of the practitioner is to attempt to accurately diagnose the cause of the headache, rule out secondary causes of headaches (“red flags”) that may signify a serious underlying pathology, provide appropriate acute management, and assist with headache prevention when needed .\n\n【27】The medical history in a patient with headaches should focus on several important areas. The quality and characteristics of the headache and its specific location and radiation should be identified. The presence of associated symptoms, especially neurologic symptoms that may suggest the presence of a focal neurologic lesion or increased intracranial pressure, must be documented. The age at which the patient first developed the headaches, the frequency and duration of the headaches, and the amount of disability and distress that is caused to the patient should be explored. It is also important to note what the patient has done to try to treat the headaches in the past, including as much detail as possible regarding medication usage (both prescription and over-the-counter \\[OTC\\]).\n\n【28】The examination should include both a general examination and a detailed neurologic examination. A funduscopic examination revealing papilledema may be supportive of the presence of increased intracranial pressure. Identifying a focal neurologic deficit increases the likelihood of finding a significant CNS pathology as the cause of the headache .\n\n【29】A patient with symptoms and signs consistent with migraine and who does not have any “red flag” findings (see Table 34–1 ) does not require any further testing prior to instituting treatment. Neuroimaging should be performed if there is an unexplained neurologic abnormality on examination or if the headache syndrome is not typical of either migraines or some other primary headache disorder. The presence of rapidly increasing headache frequency or a history of either lack of coordination, focal neurologic symptom, or headache awakening the patient from sleep raises the likelihood of finding an abnormality on an imaging test . Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be more sensitive than computed tomography (CT) scanning for the identification of abnormalities, but it may not be more sensitive at identifying _significant_ abnormalities. Other testing (eg, blood tests, electroencephalogram \\[EEG\\]) should only be performed for diagnostic purposes if there is a suspicion based on the history or physical examination.\n\n【30】The treatment of headache is best individualized based on a thorough history, physical examination, and the interpretation of any additional study results. Nonpharmacologic measures and cognitive-behavioral therapy are worth considering in most patients with primary headache disorders. The US Headache Consortium lists the following general management guidelines for the treatment of migraine headaches:\n\n【31】• Educate migraine patients about their condition and its treatment, and educate them to participate in their own management.\n\n【32】• Use migraine-specific agents (eg, triptans, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine) in patients with more severe migraines, and in those whose headaches respond poorly to treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or combination analgesics, such as aspirin plus acetaminophen plus caffeine.\n\n【33】• Select a nonoral route of administration for patients whose migraines present early with nausea or vomiting as a significant component of the symptom complex.\n\n【34】• Consider using a self-administered rescue medication for patients with severe migraine who do not respond well to other treatments.\n\n【35】• Guard against medication-overuse or rebound headaches. Patients who require acute treatment on two or more occasions per week should probably be on prophylactic treatment.\n\n【36】The goal of therapy in migraine prophylaxis is a reduction in the severity and frequency of headache by 50% or more. The strongest evidence supports the use of amitriptyline, propranolol, timolol, and divalproex sodium for migraine headache prevention.\n\n【37】### OTHER HEADACHE SYNDROMES\n\n【38】#### _Tension-Type Headache_\n\n【39】Tension headache is the most prevalent form of primary headache disorder , typically presenting with pericranial muscle tenderness and a description of a bilateral bandlike distribution of the pain. Headaches can last from 30 minutes to 7 days and there is no aggravation by walking stairs or similar routine physical activity. There is no associated nausea or vomiting. Photophobia and phonophobia are both absent, or one, but not the other, is present. They can be either episodic (<180 d/y) or chronic (>180 d/y).\n\n【40】Initial medical therapy of episodic tension-type headache includes aspirin, acetaminophen, and NSAIDs. Because of the significant risk of developing drug dependency or medication-overuse headache, avoiding caffeine-containing over-the-counter or prescription drugs and codeine- or ergotamine-containing preparations (including combination products) is recommended. The general management principles for the treatment of migraine headaches can also be applied to the treatment of chronic tension-type headaches. In frequent headache sufferers, the combination of antidepressant medications and stress management therapy reduces headache activity significantly. Other prophylactic treatments of chronic tension-type headaches include calcium channel blockers and β-blockers.\n\n【41】#### _Cluster Headache_\n\n【42】Cluster headache is strictly unilateral in location and can be located in the orbital, supraorbital, or temporal region. It is generally described as a deep, excruciating pain lasting from 15 minutes to 3 hours. The frequency can vary from one every other day to eight attacks per day. Cluster headaches are associated with ipsilateral autonomic signs and symptoms, and have a much greater prevalence in men. Compared to migraine sufferers who often desire sleep and a quiet, dark environment during their headache, individuals with cluster headache pace around, unable to find a comfortable position. The acute treatment of cluster headache involves 100% oxygen at 6 L/min, dihydroergotamine, and the triptans. Verapamil, lithium, divalproex sodium, ergotamine, and prednisone may be used for prophylactic treatment. Because of side effects related to chronic use, ergotamine and prednisone need to be used with caution.\n\n【43】#### _Chronic Medical Conditions_\n\n【44】Patients with certain underlying medical conditions have a greater incidence of having an organic cause of their headache. Patients with cancer may develop headaches as a consequence of metastases. Someone with uncontrolled hypertension (with diastolic pressures >110 mm Hg) may present with the chief complaint of headache. Patients with HIV infection or AIDS may present with central nervous system metastases, lymphoma, toxoplasmosis, or meningitis as the cause of their headache.\n\n【45】#### _Medication-Related Headache_\n\n【46】Numerous medications have headache as a reported adverse effect. Medication-overuse headache (formerly drug-induced or “rebound” headache) may occur following frequent use of any analgesic or headache medication. This includes both nonprescription (eg, acetaminophen, NSAIDs) and prescription medications. Caffeine use, whether as a component of an analgesic or a beverage, is another culprit in this category. The duration and severity of the withdrawal headache following discontinuation of the medication vary depending on the medication(s) involved.\n\n【47】### ", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Two monthspreviously she sstarted developing signs and symptoms of CS， which included 30-pound weight gain； facial fullness； supraclavicular fat pads (Fig. 27.1)； abrupt onset of acne affecting the face， neck， chest， and back； proximal muscle weakness； fatigue； accelerated hypertension； and ankle edema. On physical exam-ination her body mass index was 42 kg/mand blood pressure 150/104 mmHg. She was overtly cushingoid with a full， round， plethoric face. She had marked acne of the face， neck， upper back， and upper chest. There was hirsutism involving the\n\n【4】chin， sideburn areas， and upper lip. She had marked supraclavicular fat pads. There were no purple-red abdominal striae. She had 1+ ankle edema bilaterally.\n\n【5】**INVESTIGATIONS**\n\n【6】The baseline laboratory test results are shown in Table 27.1. Marked corticotropin (ACTH)-indepen-dent CS was clearly documented. In addition to cor-tisol， her adrenal tumor was hypersecreting adrenal androgens. There was associated hypokalemia and hyperglycemia.\n\n【7】An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed a 13×7.3×9.6-cm right adrenal mass con-sistent with ACC (Fig. 27.2).1 Chest CT showed two\n\n【8】**Fig. 27.1 Photograph of the patient’s neck showing diffuse acne and supraclavicular fat pads.**\n\n【9】| **TABLE 27.1**  | **Laboratory Tests**  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  | **Reference**  |\n| **Biochemical Test**  |  | **Result**  | **Range**  |\n| **Sodium，mmol/L**  |  | **143**  | **135-145**  |\n| **Potassium， mmol/L**  |  | **2.3**  | **3.6-5.2**  |\n| **Fasting plasma glucose， mg/dL**  |  | **231**  | **70-100**  |\n| **Creatinine，mg/dL**  |  | **0.9**  | **0.6-1.1**  |\n| **8 AM serum cortisol，mcg/dL**  |  | **57**  | **7-25**  |\n| **4 PM serum cortisol， mcg/dL**  |  | **51**  | **2-14**  |\n| **ACTH，pg/mL**  |  | **<5**  | **10-60**  |\n| **Aldosterone， ng/dL**  |  | **<4**  | **≤21**  |\n| **Plasma renin activity， ng/mL per hour**  |  | **<0.6**  | **≤0.6-3**  |\n| **DHEA-S， mcg/dL**  |  | **767**  | **18-244**  |\n| **Total testosterone，ng/dL**  |  | **152**  | **8-60**  |\n| **24-Hour urine cortisol， mcg**  |  | **462**  | **3-45**  |\n\n【10】ACTH， Corticotropin； DHEA-S， dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate.\n\n【11】6-mm nodules in the left lung with imaging character-istics consistent with metastatic disease.\n\n【12】The patient was informed that she had severe CS caused by a right ACC， and that right adrenalec-tomy would likely cure the signs and symptoms of CS-the most urgent immediate problem.2 She was also informed that she likely had metastatic ACC that would need to be addressed with systemic therapy after the adrenal surgery.\n\n【13】**TREATMENT**\n\n【14】The patient was treated with potassium chloride and spironolactone. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia pro-phylaxis and deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis were initiated. Ten days after the initial endocrine consultation she underwent open resection of a right ACC； it weighed 465 g (normal adrenal gland weight，4-5 g) and measured 18.5×18.0×5.2 cm. She declined postoperative treatment with mitotane. She was discharged from the hospital on prednisone 10 mg in the morning and 5 mg in the afternoon with a plan to taper to 5 mg every morning over 6 weeks and then transition to hydrocortisone.\n\n【15】**Fig. 27.2 Unenhanced axial computed tomography image shows a13×7.3×9.6-cm right adrenal mass (arrow) with an attenuation of28.1 Hounsfield units.**\n\n【16】**OUTCOME AND FOLLOW-UP**\n\n【17】Six months postoperatively the patient was doing very well. She had lost weight and her acne had improved dramatically. She felt completely back to normal. Blood pressure was controlled on monotherapy with a B-adrenergic blocker. Electrolyte levels were nor-mal. Total and bioavailable testosterone levels were normal， and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate was low-normal at 31.8 mcg/dL (normal， 18-244 mcg/dL). Her morning serum cortisol concentration was low-normal at6.3 mcg/dL， indicating that her hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis had not yet fully recovered. She was advised to continue her 10 mg morning dose of hydrocortisone. However， CT scan of chest， abdomen， and pelvis showed that the lung nodules had enlarged and that there was new adenopathy in the upper retro-peritoneum between the aorta and inferior vena cava. Chemotherapy with etoposide， doxorubicin， and cis-platin (EDP) was initiated.3 After three cycles there was partial tumor response； however， she discontin-ued treatment with EDP due to side effects. She sought alternative medicine approaches to her progressive metastatic ACC-—during which time her ACC became\n\n【18】widely metastatic. Unfortunately， 2 years after her adre-nal surgery， signs and symptoms of severe CS recurred. She proceeded to develop a series of complications fere 11n with pulmonary embolus， severe upper gastrointesti-nal bleeding， sepsis， and renal failure. She progressed to multiorgan system failure and death.\n\n【19】**Key Points**\n\n【20】●ACC is the most aggressive of all malignances seen by endocrinologists.\n\n【21】●ACC is associated with poor 5-year survival rates. The best survival rates are associated with stage I disease.+\n\n【22】●Stage ⅣV ACC is not curable. However， life can be extended with debulking operations to provide short-term resolutions in life-threatening severe CS.\n\n【23】1\\.

Understand emergency management of newborns with TEF.\n\n【14】##### _Considerations_\n\n【15】In this newborn with choking and coughing, esophageal atresia is suspected when an orogastric tube does not pass. Infants with esophageal atresia cannot handle oral secretions and require constant esophageal pouch drainage to prevent aspiration. They are monitored in the neonatal intensive care unit while awaiting surgical intervention.\n\n【16】APPROACH TO:\n\n【17】Esophageal Atresia\n\n【18】#### DEFINITIONS\n\n【19】ASSOCIATION: Sporadic occurrence of two or more clinical features occurring together more commonly than would be expected, but without an identifiable cause.\n\n【20】POLYHYDRAMNIOS: Diagnosis of an increased amount of amniotic fluid. SYNDROME: A constellation of features having a common cause (such as the features of Down syndrome being caused by a trisomy 21).\n\n【21】#### CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【22】Esophageal atresia occurs in 1 in 2500-3000 live births, usually accompanied by TEF. Polyhydramnios, which is also seen in duodenal atresia, is a common pregnancy complication seen with TEF. Five different TEF anatomic variants occur; the most common (87%) includes proximal atresia (esophageal pouch) with a distal fistula ( Figure 47-1 ).\n\n【23】Figure 47-1. Types of esophageal atresia/tracheoesophageal fistula. A. Proximal esophageal atresia with distal fistula (80%-90%). B. Esophageal atresia (10%). C. H-type tracheoesophageal fistula (3%).\n\n【24】Infants with TEF usually present in the newborn period with excessive oral secretions and coughing, choking, and cyanosis secondary to aspirated secretions or with initial feeds. Infants with the “H-type” fistula (approximately 4% of cases) often present later in life with recurrent aspiration pneumonia or feeding difficulty. Other congenital anomalies occur in approximately 30% to 50% of TEF patients, and a search for them is undertaken. The most common association is the VATER association ( v ertebral abnormality, a nal imperforation, t racheo e sophageal fistula, r adial and r enal anomaly).\n\n【25】Neonates with TEF or esophageal atresia are at risk for respiratory compromise due to aspiration. The esophageal pouch requires constant suctioning while awaiting surgery to ligate the fistula and anastomose the esophagus. Staged surgery is required if anatomic conditions preclude primary anastomosis. Postsurgical esophageal dysmotility may persist; chronic gastroesophageal reflux is common.\n\n【26】#### ", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The patient has a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus. She has had overnight temperature spikes to 101°F, but she has otherwise been asymptomatic with stable vital signs. Her blood cultures and wound culture are still pending. Late last night she was placed on empiric intravenous (IV) antibiotics for her wound. At admission, the medical student, the surgery intern, and the attending physician examined her. Aside from her infected wound, her entire physical examination was unremarkable. Today, the medical student’s examination reveals a harsh 3/6 holosystolic murmur at the cardiac apex, along with expansion of the wound’s surrounding erythema. On rounds, the surgery intern presented the patient’s case, accurately describing the wound changes, but described the cardiac examination as “regular rate and rhythm, with no murmurs.” The medical student knows that the intern arrived late this morning and rushed through his examination without a stethoscope.\n\n【2】 What has the surgical intern done wrong?\n\n【3】 What is the next step for the surgical intern?\n\n【4】 What is the next step for the medical student?\n\n【5】### ANSWERS TO CASE 22:\n\n【6】#### Clinical Dishonesty\n\n【7】_Summary:_ A 34-year-old woman presents to inpatient service with a lower extremity wound infection. The following morning, the medical student notes a new cardiac murmur and increased erythema surrounding the wound. During rounds, the surgical intern falsifies his physical examination by reporting a normal cardiac examination.

The trainee should assume responsibility for the clinical dishonesty and inform the team of the error in the physical examination.\n\n【10】 What is the next step for the medical student? The student has a responsibility to address the issue by performing an accurate cardiac examination.\n\n【11】### ANALYSIS\n\n【12】##### _Objectives_\n\n【13】1\\. Understand what defines dishonesty and how it may affect patients in a clinical setting.\n\n【14】2\\. Understand the appropriate response when encountering a dishonest team member.\n\n【15】##### _Considerations_\n\n【16】The surgical intern came unprepared to their clinical duties, which resulted in the inadequate examination of a patient. Compounding matters, the intern falsified his cardiac examination findings during rounds, which painted an incorrect picture of the patient’s clinical status and risked the team missing the diagnosis of bacterial endocarditis. As uncomfortable as it may be to confront a superior, the medical student must advocate for the patient. As a patient advocate and team member, the student must reveal the true physical examination findings and, if the intern is not forthcoming in admitting that he did not listen to the patient’s chest, the student should report the intern for a breach in medical ethics and clinical dishonesty.\n\n【17】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【18】#### Clinical Dishonesty\n\n【19】The road to medical school is long and arduous, and, to stay competitive for a coveted spot, students may feel compelled to cheat, lie, or both to improve their chances at admission. Cheating and acts of personal and professional dishonesty often continue throughout undergraduate medical education as the curriculum intensifies and competition for the residency selection process ensues. Residency, fellowship, and daily medical practice can also be tainted by ethical lapses and clinical dishonesty. Indeed, this behavior notoriously resurfaces when medical awards and positions or promotions are at stake.\n\n【20】Studies have shown that anywhere between 27% and 58% of medical students have cheated during medical school. It is not a surprise that students who cheat on examinations more often exhibit clinical dishonesty while completing their clinical clerkships when it is more difficult to prove lying or cheating than on a multiple-choice/computer-based test. The fact that there are more seniors than freshman who cheat in medical school contributes to the prevalence of dishonesty in a clinical setting, because students are exposed to this throughout the latter half of medical school.\n\n【21】Unsurprisingly, students who engage in clinical dishonesty to “survive” the rigors of medical school are more likely to face disciplinary action by state medical boards throughout their careers as their clinical dishonesty and unprofessional behavior is uncovered by coworkers and peers. In this regard, unprofessional behavior was defined as poor reliability and responsibility (clinical dishonesty), lack of self-improvement and adaptability, and poor initiative and motivation.\n\n【22】Testimony has shown that the false reporting of physical findings on an examination is commonplace for many students and practicing physicians. The pressure to see and juggle more patients within strict time limits, the increasing administrative burdens and documentation requirements, the odd work hours, and infrequent encounters with abnormal physical findings make it easy to find blank or copied and pasted reports within the physical examination portion of the medical record. These pressures also enable the practitioner to justify cutting corners. In essence, the busy physician abdicates his or her responsibility and convinces himself or herself that he or she is merely doing the “best I can in an otherwise dysfunctional system.”\n\n【23】Hospital-based practitioners who see the same patients on a daily basis for many days in a row also do not expect or anticipate abrupt changes in the patient’s physical examination and, as a result, may be particularly vulnerable. This mental anchoring often makes it easy for a practitioner to miss a critical finding by forgoing the necessary daily physical examination.\n\n【24】It has been suggested that the “herd mentality” in the medical environment enables students and practitioners to follow this trend as we learn from one another through observation. Copying progress notes and history and physical examination findings between students and residents without an independent examination and verification exemplifies the same dishonest principles as falsifying physical examination findings. Busy practitioners may find these practices convenient and even attempt to justify their use, but they are never in the patient’s best interests and may be detrimental to a patient’s well-being.\n\n【25】One may ask: Where does the lying stop? In the context of professional or academic misconduct, dishonesty takes many forms, including, but not limited to, fraud or deceit, cheating, plagiarism, false representation, and alteration of medical records. In fact, becoming complicit in someone else’s deceit, even if it is only remaining silent, is also a form of dishonesty. The intern’s false report of the patient’s cardiac examination is an example of clinical dishonesty. Incomplete examination of the patient puts the patient at risk, especially if the patient has underlying medical problems. It is the medical student’s responsibility to ensure the well-being of the patient by disclosing the patient’s new examination finding. If the attending is not already aware, then the student should privately notify the attending physician of the resident’s dishonesty.\n\n【26】It is both unethical and unprofessional for a health care professional to hide the dishonesty of another health care professional, especially if it endangers patient’s well-being. The student could be held liable to the same degree as the intern if he chooses to say or do nothing. As stated in the American Medical Association’s _Principles of Medical Ethics_ , “A physician shall deal honestly with patients and colleagues, and strive to expose those physicians deficient in character or competence, or who engage in fraud or deception.”\n\n【27】Failure to report ethical breaches by superiors is often predicated on fear of retaliation. For medical students, this fear typically manifests as fear of poor clinical evaluations or recommendations that adversely impact the grade that they will receive for their clerkship, which potentially impacts their class ranking and overall competitiveness for the residency selection process. For resident physicians (when the lapse is on the attending physician’s part), this fear manifests itself as concern for poor evaluations, failure to secure a fellowship recommendation, or future employment. Most medical schools and health care agencies have specific policies in place designed to protect the so-called whistle-blower from retaliatory practices and to uphold the public’s faith in the medical profession.\n\n【28】Failure to properly police and punish those in our ranks who do not safeguard the public’s health, safety, and trust is one of the factors that resulted in the marked increase in medical malpractice law suits and governmental regulation of the health care industry. The right to practice medicine and the right to learn medicine is a privilege. There is no room for malpractice in the form of clinical dishonesty, gross negligence, or malfeasance. Practitioners should not stand idly by and say nothing when others engage in such behavior. It is our duty to investigate and, whenever possible, correct all unprofessional behaviors that we encounter during our medical practice. Repeat offenders should face disciplinary action, which may include expulsion from school or residency, or license revocation or suspension.\n\n【29】### ", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "8c88fbea-fc78-4a8d-8835-5d7c481247ce", "title": null, "text": "【0】\nSession 10\n\n【1】The next session addressed the last core treatment strategy: perceptual mirror retraining. During this session, the therapist introduced mirror retraining as a strategy that targets the detailed manner of examining one’s appearance, which is exacerbated by mirror checking. She asked Carrie whether there were any disadvantages to attending to one’s appearance in this way. Carrie responded that this type of checking only made her overemphasize the importance of her appearance. The therapist also added that a detailed examination of one’s appearance could also lead to an exaggerated distortion of what the body part looks like. She demonstrated the problem of selective attention by having Carrie stare at a small mole on the therapist’s face for 60 s. Afterwards, the therapist asked Carrie what she learned. She stated that the mole seemed to appear bigger the longer she looked at it. The therapist explained that the goal of mirror retraining is to develop a healthy relationship with the mirror, rather than discontinue using the mirror, by learning to use it only during times when it serves a practical function, for example, when getting dressed for work. She further explained that mirror retraining involves a mindfulness component such that it requires to observe and describe each body part objectively, using nonjudgmental language and for equal amounts of time.\n\n【2】The therapist taught Carrie during the session to stand at an arm’s length in front of a full-length mirror and begin by describing her appearance from her head to her toes in neutral, objective, and nonjudgmental terms. Carrie was extremely uneasy about participating in this exercise, so the therapist modeled this briefly using herself as a model, emphasizing the equal amount of time she spent on each body part, and the mindfulness involved in describing qualities of her appearance in terms of color, texture, length, and width. When it was Carrie’s turn to begin the exercise, she stood in front of the mirror looking at her face and immediately began crying. The therapist asked her to identify whether any negative thoughts came up, and Carrie responded that she felt that today was such a bad day to do this exercise because she felt particularly ugly. The therapist helped her evaluate this thought by asking her whether her feelings always reflected facts. She also asked Carrie if it would help her to view this exercise as akin to taking an Advil when she had a bad headache, and that perhaps practicing mirror retraining on a particularly bad day could provide even more relief for her appearance concerns than on other days. These rational responses helped Carrie get through the exercise. The therapist suggested that for homework, she practice generating rational responses for negative thoughts beforehand and to practice mirror retraining at least three times per day.\n\n【3】Sessions 11–20\n\n【4】These sessions provided an opportunity to continue practicing with already learned skills (cognitive restructuring, exposure, ritual prevention, and perceptual retraining), as well as to learn advanced cognitive strategies and to introduce modular components of treatment that were specifically tailored to Carrie. For example, Carrie benefited from an exploration of deeper-level core beliefs through exercises such as the downward arrow technique and self-esteem pie, which helped her understand the negative consequences of holding such beliefs and helped her to evaluate the validity of these beliefs. For example, using the downward arrow technique, Carrie was asked for the meaning of her thoughts repeatedly until she discovered her core negative beliefs about herself (see Fig. 18.1 ). Then, the therapist asked her about the usefulness of having the core belief “I am unworthy,” and Carrie expressed how it just makes her feel more miserable. When examining the evidence for the intermediate belief that nobody wants to be around her, Carrie reported that even if her boyfriend or her friends initiated plans to spend time with her, she assumed that they were just being nice. Thus, Carrie learned that her core beliefs served as a lens through which all of her interpretations were made, and she had never bothered to check out these automatic assumptions.\n\n【5】Fig. 18.1\n\n【6】Carrie’s deeper-level beliefs using the downward arrow technique\n\n【7】Using the self-esteem pie exercise, the therapist asked Carrie to first list out all positive and negative components of her self-esteem. Carrie identified the following aspects: appearance, intelligence, personality, her job, and her relationships. She was then asked to draw a large circle and carve out slices for each component of her self-esteem. After this, it was clear that Carrie had placed greatest importance on her appearance, which she believed was a negative component, as her appearance slice took up about 75 % of the pie. The therapist then challenged Carrie to identify some of her strengths and talents and even asked her if she could identify some aspects of her appearance that she liked. Through this discussion, Carrie learned that she believed that she was quite smart and had a very caring personality. She actually quite liked the shape of her legs and her eye color. She was also quite proud of her achievements at work, as her supervisors told her that she was a conscientious worker and had become a resourceful member of her team. After calling upon these experiences that she was initially quick to ignore and dismiss and discussing the advantages and disadvantages of overvaluing appearance, Carrie revised her self-esteem pie with more balanced slices.\n\n【8】Furthermore, sessions were spent on treatment modules that were tailored to Carrie. For example, given that her depression contributed to her avoidance of going to work and social activities, one session was spent on strategies that could specifically target her depression. Carrie learned how to apply her cognitive restructuring skill to her depressogenic negative thoughts and became aware of her common errors in thinking related to depression. She also learned how to plan pleasant or masterful activities into her schedule each week, such as going to a yoga class, joining a book club, and calling her cousin who lived in another state.\n\n【9】Another module that was applicable to Carrie was the cosmetic surgery module, as Carrie expressed strong urges to receive more aggressive dermatological treatment for her acne. The primary approach in addressing her urges was to use motivational interviewing and Socratic questioning techniques to discuss the pros and cons of getting more treatment. The therapist also helped Carrie identify cognitive errors in her thinking by asking her about what she feared would happen if she did not get the treatment. Despite this approach, Carrie was still pretty convinced that another dermatological treatment would resolve the problems she had with dermabrasion and make her feel less ugly. The therapist therefore asked Carrie how she would feel about delaying the treatment for another three months and taking her time thinking it through, given her bad experience with dermabrasion before. Carrie ultimately agreed with this plan because she was concerned about the risks.\n\n【10】\nSessions 21–22\n\n【11】These final sessions constituted the relapse prevention and termination sessions. The purpose of these sessions was to transition Carrie’s responsibilities to become her own therapist and provide an opportunity to practice checking in with herself about ways to maintain her progress. In these last two sessions, the therapist assisted in reviewing strategies that Carrie found helpful and in anticipating upcoming challenges where she could begin to practice her skills. For example, Carrie mentioned that she had an upcoming work-related Christmas party, which her boyfriend would be attending with her. She reported anticipatory anxious thoughts about what people would think about her compared to her boyfriend and identified rational responses to begin evaluating the validity of these thoughts.\n\n【12】Posttreatment Assessment Results\n\n【13】By the end of treatment, Carrie scored a 14 on the BDD-YBOCS, which represented a 52 % reduction in BDD symptoms. She reported significantly less time spent preoccupied with thoughts about her appearance and engaging in rituals to relieve her concerns. She had continued to cut down her grooming ritual each morning to 15 min and reported having fewer negative thoughts about herself. She also scored a 10 on the BABS for her belief, “I am ugly,” which reflected a 41 % reduction in delusionality. Her BDD-SS questionnaire further indicated less avoidance of people, places, and activities; improved beliefs about the importance of appearance; and fewer rituals related to grooming and mirror checking.\n\n【14】\nComplicating Factors\n--------------------\n\n【15】For Carrie, the greatest complicating factor was her delusionality . The problem with delusionality is not just that it makes cognitive restructuring and data gathering more challenging, but it causes a general barrier to motivation for treatment because of a lack of buy-in to the rationale of CBT for BDD. This likely contributed to ambivalence about the efficacy of the CBT program and core treatment techniques, as well as resistance to completing between-session homework assignments. Carrie’s degree of conviction that she was truly ugly and that all of her problems stemmed from this also contributed to her decision to seek nonpsychiatric treatments. Cognitive restructuring was especially difficult for Carrie due to her delusionality , as she was susceptible to confirmation biases when she attempted to seek out new information in her exposure exercises, especially as it related to facial expressions. For example, she often found that even though she met her behavioral goals during exposures, she was convinced that she often received dirty looks from other attractive people and that they were thinking negative thoughts about her appearance, which made it difficult for her to make accurate interpretations about having completed a successful exposure.\n\n【16】Another complicating factor was Carrie’s comorbid depression and suicidality, which was secondary to her BDD, but further contributed to her social avoidance. Indeed, her depression had exacerbated so much at the beginning of treatment that a detailed discussion of safety and suicidal ideation was indicated at each early session. The safety plan that was generated early on in treatment was continually referred to during treatment, and emergency procedures, which represented later steps in the safety plan, were reviewed and defined repeatedly. To further address her depression, session content was applied to examples of her worsened mood during her week. For example, Carrie identified negative thoughts about being a bad friend and girlfriend, which were less related to her appearance concerns but were still amenable to the cognitive restructuring skills.\n\n【17】Conclusions and Key Practice Points\n-----------------------------------\n\n【18】CBT for BDD is similar to CBT for other psychiatric disorders in terms of the basic model and core treatment principles. However, there are important differences. One of the key issues in treatment is that individuals with BDD are overly focused on the importance of appearance. BDD patients are not able to see themselves holistically and instead focus on their perceived flaw, to the exclusion of appreciating almost everything else about them. A large focus of the treatment is therefore to notice all of their features (not just the ones they do not like) when they look in the mirror and to make an effort to notice other, nonappearance related qualities in other people. Finally, they need to learn to base a larger part of their self-esteem on nonappearance qualities.\n\n【19】Another unique clinical feature is that individuals with BDD may exhibit elaborate delusions of reference about others thinking of and mocking their appearance. In some cases, they may develop complex delusions about the social and career advantages of being attractive. Rather than engage the patient in an argument about the validity of his or her beliefs, it is best to adopt a curious approach to his or her interpretations and help the patient consider the usefulness (evaluating pro’s and con’s) of holding these beliefs.\n\n【20】BDD is also associated with particularly high rates of attempted and completed suicide. In general, CBT is efficacious for many patients with suicidal ideation; however, some patients (especially those with active suicidal ideation) may require a higher level of care and some patients may need CBT augmented with psychotropic medication. For patients at a higher risk of suicide , a safety plan (American Psychiatric Association 2003 ) would be important to generate together at one of the earliest sessions, which would describe a list of steps to take when suicidal ideation worsens and which would list the therapist’s emergency contact and nearest emergency room as the last steps. Ongoing suicide assessment would be required at subsequent sessions using both a depression self-report questionnaire and direct questioning.\n\n【21】Finally, as with all psychological treatments, it is important to begin establishing a strong alliance with the patient early on in treatment. We have found in our experience treating patients with BDD that a common issue involves motivation for treatment and ambivalence about receiving psychological treatment. Addressing their ambivalence from the outset is strongly recommended, as it facilitates the discussion of advantages and disadvantages of CBT, as compared to their past treatment approaches and promotes readiness for change (Table 18.2 ).\n\n【22】Table 18.2\n\n【23】Key practice points for treating BDD\n\n【24】| 1\\.

Our experience, together with empirical data (Wilhelm et al. 2011 , 2013 , 2014 ), have shown that CBT is acceptable and efficacious for this patient population. Patients often achieve meaningful reductions in their BDD-related thoughts, avoidance behaviors, and rituals, as well as greater flexibility in their beliefs about the importance of appearance.\n\n【26】", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The major histocompatibility antigens carried by an individual may also confer susceptibility to， or protection against， certain autoimmune diseases that can be incited by infection (Fig. 39.1).\n\n【5】There are only a few conditions in which an infection has been identified as the direct cause of the autoimmune disease. Thelongest established is rheumatic fever， which in the pre-antibiotic age was a frequent long-term consequence of infec-tion with Streptococcus pyogenes (scarlet fever). Some strains of S. pyogenes lead to a type III autoimmune disease (caused by immune-complex formation； see also Case 36) of the renal glomeruli called post-streptococcal acute glomerulonephritis. These streptococcal strains are said to be nephrogenic (causing nephritis). About3-4% of children infected with a nephrogenic strain of streptococcus will develop acute glomerulonephritis within a week or two of the onset of the streptococcal infection. What predisposes this subset of children to develop the complication is unknown.\n\n【6】**Fig. 39.1 Association of infection**\n\n【7】**with autoimmune diseases. Several autoimmune diseases occur after specific infections and are presumably triggered by the infection. The case of post-streptococcal disease is best known. Most of these post-infection autoimmune diseases also show susceptibility linked to the MHC.**\n\n【8】| **Associations of infection with immune-mediated tissue damage**  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Infection**  | **HLA association**  | **Consequence**  |\n| **Group A StreptocoCCUS**  | **?**  | **Rheumatic fever(carditis， polyarthritis)**  |\n| **Chlamydia trachomatis**  | **HLA-B27**  | **Reiter's syndrome (arthritis)**  |\n| **Shigella flexneri，** **Salmonella typhimurium，Salmonelia enteritidis，Yersinia enterocolitica，Campylobacter jejuni**  | **HLA-B27**  | **Reactive arthritis**  |\n| **Borrelia burgdorferi**  | **HLA-DR2， -DR4**  | **Chronic arthritisin Lyme disease**  |\n\n【9】A direct association of infection with autoimmune disease also occurs in patients with pneumonia caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae， the case we shall discuss here. About 30% of patients with this infection develop a transient increase in serum antibody to a red blood cell antigen， and a small proportion of these patients develop hemolytic anemia， a type II autoimmune disease. Other type II autoim-mune diseases arelisted in Fig. 40.1. In this case， the decrease in the number of red blood cells (anemia) results from their immunological destruction (hemolysis) as a result of the binding of an IgM autoantibody to a carbohydrate antigen on the red cell surface. When the infection subsides， either spontaneously or after treatment， the autoimmune disorder disappears.\n\n【10】The IgM autoantibody agglutinates red blood cells at temperatures below 37°C. The antibodies are therefore called cold hemagglutinins or cold agglutinins， and the hemolytic disorder is known as cold agglutinin disease. Low titers of cold aggluti-nins (detectable at up to 1：30 dilution of serum) occur in healthy people. In about one-third of patients with mycoplasma infection there is a transient increase in the titer， but without symptoms； the rise usually goes unnoticed unless the patient happens to have a blood test， when clumping of the erythrocytes will be apparent.\n\n【11】The autoantibodies in the transient cold agglutinin syndrome resemble those in the chronic autoimmune disorder known as chronic cold agglutinin disease， which is of unknown etiology. This runs a protracted course in which the autoantibod-ies are characteristically oligoclonal， and lymphoproliferative disorders commonly develop. Thus chronic cold agglutinin disease behaves as a variant of an IgM gam-mopathy called Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia.A gammopathy is an abnormal monoclonal or oligoclonal spike in the immunoglobulin electrophoretic pattern.\n\n【12】**Gwendolen Fairfax was a healthy， unmarried 34-year-old who worked as a manager in a bank. She had never had any illness other than minor colds and the usual child-hood infections. After developing a feverish cough her symptoms got progressively worse over the next few days and she decided to seek the advice of her physician， Dr Wilde.**\n\n【13】**Dr Wilde noted that Gwendolen was extremely pale； this was particularly notice-able in the palms of her hands， which were completely white. (Look at your palms； they have a healthy reddish pink color， unless your hemoglobin level is less than**\n\n【14】**10 g dl-1). Her temperature was raised， at 38.5C， and her respiratory rate was 30 per minute (normal 20). On listening to her chest， the physician heard scattered rhonchi(harsh breath sounds) at the bases of both lungs.**\n\n【15】**In the hospital， a sputum sample proved negative for bacteria but contained abun-dant neutrophils. A blood sample was tested for the presence of antibodies against _the red blood cells. In the presence of sodium citrate as an anticoagulant， the sam-_ ple was chilled to 4°C； the red cells became clumped and the blood looked as though it had clotted. When warmed to 37C， however， the red cells dispersed. Thus， the red cells were reversibly agglutinated in the cold. A blood sample was spun in a warmed centrifuge， and the red cells and plasma were separated. Gwendolen's red cells were tested using direct and indirect Coombs tests for the presence of anti-red celllgG antibody (see Fig. 44.2)； these tests proved negative. Her red cells， however， were strongly agglutinated by an antibody against the complement component C3.**\n\n【16】**When Gwendolen’s plasma， or dilutions of the plasma， were incubated in the refrig-erator with red cells from type 0 normal blood， the red cells were strongly aggluti-nated； when the same test was performed with red cells obtained from an umbilical cord in the delivery room of the hospital， agglutination was weaker， or negligible.**\n\n【17】**Gwendolen was started on erythromycin. In 3 days her symptoms had abated； she had no fever and her cough had greatly improved. Her hemoglobin had risen to _12 g dl-1. She was discharged from the hospital， and advised to continue erythro-_ mycin orally and to avoid exposure to cold weather. When she returned to Dr Wilde's office 2 weeks later for a check-up， her fever had not returned， her cough had gone， and her hemoglobin was now a normal 14.5g dl-1.**\n\n【18】**Autoimmune hemolytic anemia.**\n\n【19】Gwendolen's autoimmune hemolytic anemia was transient， persisting only as long as the infection persisted. In contrast， autoantibodies against red blood cells in chronic autoimmune disorders of unknown origin tend to be persistent. Transient autoantibodies most frequently develop after nonbacterial infections， such as infectious mononucleosis (see Case 43). Autoimmune hemolytic anemia can also be induced by certain chemicals and drugs.\n\n【20】**The autoantibodies in autoimmune hemolytic anemias are of the IgM or IgG class. They bring about hemolysis of the red blood cells either by complement fixation or adherence of the red cells to the Fcy receptors on cells of the fixed mononuclear phagocytic system-principally in the spleen， but also in the liver and other organs(Fig.39.3).**\n\n【21】Anti-erythrocyte antibodies can differ in their physical properties. Some bind to the red blood cells at 37℃ (warm autoantibodies)； some bind at lower tempera-tures (cold hemagglutinins or hemolysins， like those in Gwendolen's case). In 1904， Donath and Landsteiner (wholater received the Nobel Prize for the discovery ofthe ABO blood groups) reported antibodies in the blood of patients with syphilis that\n\n【22】**Fig. 39.2 Chest radiograph of a patient with mycoplasma pneumonia. Patchy opacities (arrowed) are evident in the lungs. Courtesy of T. Griscom.**\n\n【23】**Fig. 39.4 Structure of thel and i antigen regions with which cold agglutinins react. Gal， galactose； GlcNAc， N-acetylglucosamine.**\n\n【24】bound to human red blood cells at cold temperatures. These antibodies differ from cold agglutinins in that they cause the lysis of erythrocytes by complement when the blood is warmed to 37C. These antibodies are still called Donath-Landsteiner or DL antibodies.\n\n【25】A transient increase in cold agglutinins is most frequently encountered during mycoplasma infection， infectious mononucleosis (the result of infection with the Epstein-Barr virus； see Case 43)， and， rarely， during other viral infections. In myco-plasma pneumonia the cold autoantibodies react with a red cell surface antigen called the I antigen. This is a branched carbohydrate structure that occurs on gly-coproteins and glycolipids (Fig. 39.4). Cord blood cells express only small amounts of the I antigen and that is why Gwendolen's plasma did not agglutinate them， or did so only weakly. Cord erythrocytes express a related antigen， i (see Fig.39.4)；the I antigen is not fully expressed on red blood cells until 6 months of age.\n\n【26】**It has not been possible to find with certainty a cross-reacting I antigen on Mycoplasma pneumoniae， which would provide a simple explanation for this auto-immune disease. Exactly how M. pneumoniae triggers the transient production of an autoantibody directed to red cells is not known， although there is a strong biochemical similarity between the attachment site (ligand) for the mycoplasma on the host cell surface and the red cell antigen to which the autoantibody binds Fig.39.5).**\n\n【27】**Questions.**", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

A pregnant woman could \n\n【21】be said to owe a moral duty to the unborn child due to the impact that her actions may \n\n【22】have on its future well-being. However, legal status is only acquired when a child is born \n\n【23】(Paton v BPAS 1979), and an unborn child therefore has no rights until birth.\n\n【24】A mother cannot be sued in negligence for harm caused in utero (unless the harm occurred \n\n【25】as a result of a road traffic accident where insurance would fund a claim for compensation). \n\n【26】In the case of CP (A Child) v First-tier Tribunal (Criminal Injuries Compensation) (2014) a \n\n【27】claim was made that a woman who drank heavily during pregnancy, despite warnings of the \n\n【28】consequences, resulting in the child being born with foetal alcohol syndrome had committed \n\n【29】a crime against her unborn child. Section 23 Offences Against the Person Act 1861 provides \n\n【30】that it is unlawful to administer to any other person any noxious agent to inflict grievous \n\n【31】bodily harm. The alcohol was a noxious agent but the claim failed because the court held the \n\n【32】foetus was not a person at the time it was taken. There would be profound implications if a \n\n【33】mother could be held liable, in negligence or through a criminal act, for harms to her unborn \n\n【34】child, and this could change the relationship she has with healthcare professionals during \n\n【35】her pregnancy.\n\n【36】A healthcare professional owes a duty of care to the pregnant woman as his patient. During \n\n【37】pregnancy the foetus is not a legal person, so how can it be owed a duty of care? The Congenital \n\n【38】Disabilities (Civil Liability) Act 1976 enables the child once born to make a claim for com￾pensation for disabilities which occurred before birth as a result of a breach of duty owed to \n\n【39】one of his parents. Once born any claim crystallies and relates to harm sustained in utero. \n\n【40】Josephine’s baby was born disabled as a result of exposure to the rubella virus. As the two \n\n【41】blood tests were contradictory, the doctor’s failure to check with the laboratory or run a \n\n【42】new test could be negligent (Case 41), and if so, the child born could sue in respect of the \n\n【43】disabilities incurred.\n\n【44】A ‘wrongful life’ claim is one made by a child alleging that but for the negligence of the doctor \n\n【45】he would not be born because the mother was deprived of the choice not to continue with the \n\n【46】pregnancy, i.e., Josephine’s lack of option to have an abortion because she was not properly \n\n【47】informed of the risk of giving birth to a child with such disabilities.

When faced with a question like this， or indeed in clinical practice with a patient like this， it is important to approach the diagnosis， investigation and management in a logical manner， informed by an understanding of the underlying epidemiology of childhood cancer， and always maintaining a focus on the emergency management of the patient during the diagnostic process.**\n\n【30】**In the first and second questions， regarding investigations most likely to establish a diagnosis and what that diagnosis is likely to be， you should think about which abdominal tumours may present in a child of this age. Neuroblastoma is the commonest non-central nervous system childhood solid tumour， but an abdominal mass could also be seen in hepatoblastoma， leukaemia， lymphoma， Wilm’s tumour， or an array of other rare tumours such as germ cell tumours or soft tissue sarcomas.**\n\n【31】**Consider Dougie's clinical features of rapid presentation， hypertension， pain and misery. These are typical of high risk neuroblastoma， but not of the other most common solid abdominal tumours. Leukaemia and lymphoma are plausible， but the normal blood count and the large abdominal mass， combined with the other clinical features， especially hypertension， make these less likely. The mass and hypertension could be present in a Wilm's tumour， but in the absence of tumour rupture， pain is less common， and the bone pain suggested by reluctance to weight bear is not seen. Hepatoblastoma would fit with the location of the mass， but again the overall clinical picture of an acutely unwell child with irritability and pain are not classical， and in terms of epidemiology hepatoblastoma is significantly less common than neuroblastoma.**\n\n【32】**While it is vital to understand that the only investigation which will definitively establish a diagnosis is a biopsy of the tumour， there are many investigations that will be performed prior to this， which may strongly suggest one diagnosis over the others. All of the investigations listed in question 1 will be performed， but you must focus on the wording of the question， and judge which is most likely to establish the diagnosis.**\n\n【33】**LDH is a non-specific test， and may be raised in any malignancy. It is useful to know as it will guide your assessment of risk of tumour lysis syndrome. Tumour lysis syndrome is an oncological emergency (1)， which results from the breakdown of dying tumour cells and the release of their intracellular contents in the form of purines and their breakdown products， ultimately uric acid， and electrolytes， particularly potassium and phosphate. Uric acid can be deposited in the renal tubules as urate crystals， leading to renal insufficiency， and the renal threshold for potassium and phosphate can be exceeded，leading to life threatening accumulation of these electrolytes. Phosphate ions can then bind with calcium to form calcium phosphate， which can also be deposited in crystalline form， further impairing renal function. Tumour lysis syndrome**\n\n【34】**is most often precipitated by the treatment of cancer， particularly high grade B cell malignancies， or high white blood cell count leukaemia， but it can be present in any bulky tumour， and can occur spontaneously or in response to other physiological stressors such as anaesthesia or surgery.**\n\n【35】**Urine catecholemines measure the concentration of catecholemines， phenolic acids， and metadrenalines in the urine. These are hormones secreted by the sympathetic nervous system， and in neuroblastoma， an unregulated growth of cells with sympathetic nervous system origin， they will very commonly be abnormally raised， and in conjunction with this clinical presentation will make a diagnosis of neuroblastoma almost certain (but you still need a biopsy!).**\n\n【36】**Alfafetoprotein will be significantly raised in the majority of hepatoblastomas， and in secreting germ cell tumours， but will not distinguish between the two. Neurone specific enolase is an enzyme which can be over expressed by tumours whose embryological origin is the neural crest (including neuroblastoma)， and if raised， it can be useful as a marker of response to treatment， and for future monitoring for tumour recurrence. However whilst it is often raised in neuroblastoma it is neither sensitive nor specific. Ferritin may be raised in any malignancy， and is of prognostic significance in neuroblastoma， but is not diagnostic of any individual tumour.**\n\n【37】**In any question about the initial management of a patient， take a step back and think about the patient in front of you. Do they have any compromise of airway， breathing or circulation? Are they in pain? Is there evidence of sepsis? It is easy to become fixated on the management of the underlying condition， but unless this is vital to ABC or relieving immediate distress， it is unlikely to be the correct answer. In the third question， any of the answers are plausible， but the absolute priority is to relieve the pain that is clearly described， and this should be with carefully titrated intravenous morphine.**\n\n【38】**Hyperhydration is used as part of the prophylaxis of tumour lysis syndrome. Its aim is to maintain good hydration and urine output to allow clearance of the toxic metabolites released from the dying tumour cells described earlier. It will be part of the early management of this patient， but bear in mind that tumour lysis syndrome is not common in most solid malignancies， and in the presence of ascites and pleural effusion， hyperhydration should not be rushed into without careful thought and involvement of both the oncology and renal teams.**\n\n【39】**Emergency chemotherapy is a possibility， and may help to control the ascites and pleural effusion， and subsequently improve the pain， but it is always going to take longer to organise than the simple measure of analgesia. Radiotherapy involves the use of ionising radiation delivered to the tumour， which disrupts the formation of new DNA by tumour cells， thereby impairing their ability to replicate. Emergency radiotherapy is rarely required， is not going to have an immediate effect， and is reserved for the control of life threatening symptoms where surgery may not be possible， and chemotherapy may be challenging to deliver， such as some cases of airway compromise， mediastinal compression or spinal cord compression from the tumour. Even emergency radiotherapy will require hours or days to organise and plan， and it is therefore unlikely to be the initial step in the management of any patient. In the case of tumour rupture or uncontrolled haemorrhage from the tumour， emergency surgery may be necessary， but this is a last resort， as the overall clinical state of the child will make it extremely risky.**\n\n【40】**Syllabus Mapping**\n\n【41】**Haematology and Oncology**\n\n【42】_·_ Know the causes of bleeding， purpura and bruising and recognise features in the presentation which suggest serious underlying pathology\n\n【43】_·_ Know the clinical manifestations of acute leukaemia， lymphoma， and solid tumours\n\n【44】·Know how to assess a child with lymphadenopathy or other masses and when to refer\n\n【45】**_·_ Know about the risks and benefits of ionising radiation**\n\n【46】**", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

He denies chest pain, dyspnea, fevers, or chills. He suffered a myocardial infarction five years ago. He is taking aspirin, lisinopril, and metoprolol. His ECG is shown in the image. He is admitted to the hospital for therapy consisting of rate control and anticoagulation. After successful inpatient treatment, he is discharged with new medicines. Which of the following is the mechanism of the anticoagulant used in the long-term therapy of this patient’s condition?\n\n【1】> Reproduced, with permission, from USMLERx.com.\n\n【2】> (A) Activation of antithrombin III\n\n【3】> (B) Antibody to tumor necrosis factor-α\n\n【4】> (C) Inhibition of γ-carboxylation of vitamin γ-dependent clotting factors\n\n【5】> (D) Inhibition of cyclooxygenase\n\n【6】> (E) Inhibition of the ADP pathway of thrombus formation\n\n【7】 **Answer**: The correct answer is C . This patient suffers from atrial fibrillation, as demonstrated by the absence of P waves on ECG, which places him at higher risks for mural thrombosis and embolic complications. Warfarin is the anticoagulant of choice. Warfarin inhibits γ-carboxylation of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X and proteins C and S, and is used for chronic anticoagulation. It is taken orally and has a long half-life. Measurement of the degree of anticoagulation must be followed by measurement of the International Normalized Ratio (INR).  \n  \nAnswer A is incorrect . Heparin works by catalyzing the activation of antithrombin III, decreasing the level of available thrombin, and inhibiting factor Xa. Heparin has a short half-life and can be monitored by using the partial thromboplastin time (PTT). Heparin is used commonly in the in-patient setting to treat thrombosis or to anticoagulate symptomatic patients before bridging them to warfarin; however, it is not used in the long-term management of atrial fibrillation.  \n  \nAnswer B is incorrect . Infliximab is a monoclonal antibody to tumor necrosis factor-a, thereby interfering with inflammation. It is used to treat many chronic inflammatory/rheumatologic conditions including refractory Crohn disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis, and to promote fistula healing.  \n  \nAnswer D is incorrect . Aspirin works by irreversibly inhibiting cyclooxygenase, thereby preventing the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins. The four effects of aspirin are antiplatelet, antipyretic, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory. Aspirin is a powerful antiplatelet agent; however, it is not used routinely in the management of atrial fibrillation unless the patient is low risk based on the 2006 American Heart Association guidelines.  \n  \nAnswer E is incorrect . Clopidogrel acts by inhibiting platelet aggregation by irreversibly inhibiting the ADP pathway involved in the binding of fibrinogen to the platelet surface. It is used in the setting of acute coronary syndrome and stenting.\n", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Histopathology shows a proliferation of collagen \n\n【22】in the dermis and subcutis. The cause of this localized dermal scleroderma is unknown. \n\n【23】Women between the ages of 20–50 years are most commonly affected. The lesions \n\n【24】themselves are usually asymptomatic. Skin changes are usually localized and initially \n\n【25】erythematous/violaceous oval plaques which progress into ivory-coloured, hardening \n\n【26】plaques measuring 1–20 cm in diameter. Morphoea may be circumscribed, generalized, \n\n【27】linear and occasionally involve underlying structures (pansclerotic).\n\n【28】This patient had the generalized form of the disease with multiple plaques over her trunk. \n\n【29】Linear morphoea, in contrast, normally affects the extremities, particularly over the fron￾toparietal scalp/face where a deep-seated form of linear scleroderma ‘en coup de sabre’ \n\n【30】can occur. The sclerotic skin grows no hair and the underlying skull bone may become \n\n【31】distorted.\n\n【32】Although the aetiology of morphoea is unknown, recognized triggers include local skin \n\n【33】injury, post-radiation and viral infections such as measles. A small proportion of patients \n\n【34】with classical morphoea developed the disease following tick bites, which transmit Lyme \n\n【35】disease due to Borrelia burgdorferi infection. Autoantibodies may be positive including \n\n【36】rheumatoid factor, antinuclear and antihistone antibodies. \n\n【37】The clinical course is generally slowly progressive, although some cases can ‘burn out’ \n\n【38】and others spontaneously resolve. Extensive sclerotic plaques on the limbs can be associ￾ated with stiffness, weakness and loss of mobility. \n\n【39】Management is difficult. However, some success has been with topical vitamin D ana￾logues (calcipotriol), intralesional and systemic corticosteroids, methotrexate, ciclosporin \n\n【40】and psoralen–UVA/UVB or UVA1.\n\n【41】 KEY POINTS\n\n【42】• Morphoea appears as ivory-coloured, hardening plaques.\n\n【43】• It can be circumscribed, generalized, linear and may affect underlying structures.\n\n【44】• The aetiology is unknown, but triggers include local skin injury and viral infections.73\n\n【45】", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The iguana had been examined at another veterinary hospital 3 weeks prior for reevaluation of a possible intracoelomic mass that was diagnosed 5 months earlier. According to the owner, the blood profile performed at the other facility was considered to be normal; however, a radiograph taken at that time revealed an intracoelomic mass. No further workup had been performed and the iguana had been doing well since then. According to the owner, an ovariohysterectomy had been performed on the iguana 4 years earlier when the lizard developed dystocia.\n\n【7】The owner noticed a small swelling on the right side of the dorsal aspect of the tail base. The swelling had increased in size during the past few days and now involved the other side of the tail along the dorsal midline.﻿\n\n【8】Physical Examination Findings\n\n【9】The iguana was bright, alert, and responsive and appeared to be in good body condition. No abnormalities were noted other than a small swelling at the base of the tail. An aspirate of the swelling was obtained for cytologic examination. A blood sample was collected via caudal venipuncture for a complete blood count and plasma biochemistry profile. Whole body radiographs were also obtained ( Tables 73.1 and 73.2 and Figs. 73.1 \\- 73.3 ).﻿\n\n【10】Interpretive Discussion\n\n【11】The current hemogram ( Table 73.1 ) revealed significant changes compared with 3 weeks prior that included leukopenia, lymphopenia, a slight monocytosis, anemia, and drop in the plasma protein. It is possible that the blood sample was diluted with lymphatic fluid, a common occurrence when sampling blood from reptiles. The hemogram could also signal blood loss anemia along with an overwhelming inflammatory response that has resulted in consumption of heterophils. The significant plasma biochemistry profile changes indicated a loss to plasma protein supporting the drop in plasma protein (refractometric) found on the hemogram.\n\n【12】Table 73.1 . Hematology results.\n\n【13】<sup><em>a </em></sup> Diethelm (2005).\n\n【14】Table 73.2 . Plasma biochemistry results.\n\n【15】<sup><em>a </em></sup> Diethelm (2005).\n\n【16】Fig. 73.1 . (a–d) The cytology of the tail base (Wright–Giemsa stain, 100x).\n\n【17】The fluid aspirated from the swelling on the left side of the tail base resembled blood. Figure 73.1a shows a heterophil and a monocyte with numerous erythro-cytes. There appears to be an increase in the degree of polychromasia, suggesting a regenerative response. Figure 73.1b shows a multinucleated giant cell that has phagocytized cells that appear to be remnants of ery-throcytes. Figure 73.1c shows a multinucleated giant cell that is clearly demonstrating erythrophagocytosis and a heterophil. Figure 73.1d shows four nondegen-erate heterophils and numerous erythrocytes. The cy-tologic examination indicates peripheral blood contamination of the sample; however, it also demonstrates erythrophagocytosis and perhaps an increased number of inflammatory cells indicating previous hemorrhage into the lesion.\n\n【18】Fig. 73.2 . The whole body radiographs: dorsoventral view (a) and lateral view (b).\n\n【19】The packed cell volume (PCV) from the blood obtained from the tail vein was 10%. The PCV of the aspirated fluid was 30%. This finding is supportive of hemorrhage into the lesion and the hemogram findings, suggesting a blood loss anemia. The lesion, therefore, could represent a hematoma, hemangioma, or heman-giosarcoma.\n\n【20】The radiographic changes ( Figs. 73.2 and 73.3 ) between the current radiographs and the ones obtained 3 weeks prior include a large, poorly circumscribed soft tissue mass surrounding the sacrococcygeal junction. There is gas seen within the soft tissues in this area. There are multiple areas of bone lysis of the vertebrae, laminae, and the dorsal spinous processes in this area. There is also some dystrophic mineralization seen within the mass. These findings are consistent with an aggressive neoplasia. The hemoclips seen in the sublumbar area are consistent with this iguana's previous surgery.\n\n【21】Fig. 73.3 . The radiographs for the evaluation of the tail base lesion: dorsoventral view (a) and lateral view (b).﻿\n\n【22】Summary\n\n【23】The iguana was treated with a fluorinated chloramphenicol (30 mg/kg PO q 24 hours for 10 days), and an exploratory surgery of the coelomic cavity and tail mass was performed. The mass seen on the radiographs was a retained egg that may have been left in the coelomic cavity 4 years prior when an ovariosalpingohysterectomy was performed for dystocia. Surgical debridement of the tail mass revealed a large amount of clotted blood and a broken tail. A biopsy was obtained for histopathologic examination. The tail was bandaged and the iguana was hospitalized for 1 day. One week later, the iguana returned for examination of the fracture site. It was noted at that time that the iguana was exhibiting paresis of the tail and hind limbs and she was not able to defecate. There was no improvement in the appearance of the tail lesion. The owner elected euthanasia of the iguana and a necropsy was performed.\n\n【24】Histopathologic examination of the tail lesion revealed a severe chronic caseous, granulomatous, and heterophilic myositis and osteomyelitis with myeloma–lacia. The inflammatory process was likely associated with an infectious agent according to the report; however, no organism was visualized with special stains or culture.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

It can be administered to immunocompromised patients.\n\n【2】B. It is not associated with vaccine-related cases of poliomyelitis.\n\n【3】C. It induces local intestinal immunity.\n\n【4】D. It is easily administered as a series of multiple injections.\n\n【5】E. It can be given to young children with other scheduled immunizations.\n\n【6】**Answer**: 34.1 C. The oral polio vaccine or “live” vaccine produces not only IgM and IgG antibodies in the blood but also secretory IgA antibodies in the intestine, resulting in intestinal immunity. The inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine produces humoral immunity, not localized intestinal immunity.\n\n【7】Answers A, B, D, and E are incorrect. Only the inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine is administered to immunocompromised patients. The OPV has been associated with transfer of live poliovirus to close contacts of immunized patients; therefore, use of the IPV is currently recommended in the United States for childhood immunizations. It is easily administered in multiple oral doses, not injections. Both the OPV and the IPV can be given to young children with other scheduled immunizations.\n\n【8】\n**Question**: 34.2 The primary pathologic effect of polio viral infection is a result of which of the following?\n\n【9】A. Destruction of infected cells\n\n【10】B. Paralysis of muscle cells\n\n【11】C. Immune complex formation\n\n【12】D. Aseptic meningitis\n\n【13】E. Persistent viremia\n\n【14】**Answer**: 34.2 A. Polioviruses are cytolytic and cause direct damage to infected cells. Answers B, C, D, and E are incorrect. Paralysis results in fewer than 2% of patients who are infected with poliovirus, and it is a direct result of the destruction of infected neurons in the spinal cord and brain. Paralytic disease is caused by cytolytic damage because of the virus, not by the immune response. Aseptic meningitis is a result of poliovirus infection that occurs in less than 1% to 2% of patients infected and is a result of the destruction of infected cells. If it is not contained by the host antibody response, poliovirus infection may result in “minor” and “major” viremic spread within the patient; however, the primary pathologic effect of poliovirus is still the cell lysis of infected cells.\n\n【15】\n**Question**: 34.3 The majority of nonimmunized patients infected with poliovirus would be expected to experience which of the following symptoms?\n\n【16】A. Flulike illness\n\n【17】B. Aseptic meningitis\n\n【18】C. Muscle spasms and pain\n\n【19】D. Flaccid paralysis of ≥1 extremities\n\n【20】E. Asymptomatic infection\n**Answer**: 34.3 E. More than 90% of infections with poliovirus result in asymptomatic infections. Answers A, B, C, and D are incorrect.

The \n\n【21】type of symptom and the most appropriate investigations depend on whether the problem \n\n【22】is primarily oropharyngeal or oesophageal.\n\n【23】Oropharyngeal dysphagia can be caused by:\n\n【24】• central neurological disorders such as stroke, brainstem tumours or degenerative dis￾eases (e.g. Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis and Huntington’s disease);\n\n【25】• peripheral neurological disorders including peripheral neuropathy, poliomyelitis and \n\n【26】syphilis;\n\n【27】• systemic disorders such as myasthenia gravis, polymyositis, dermatomyositis or mus￾cular dystrophy;\n\n【28】• oropharyngeal lesions including cricopharyngeal achalasia, tumours, inflammatory \n\n【29】masses, Zenker’s diverticulum, oesophageal webs, extrinsic structural lesions, anterior \n\n【30】mediastinal masses and cervical spondylosis; see Case 66.\n\n【31】Oesophageal dysphagia can be caused by:\n\n【32】• achalasia;\n\n【33】• spastic motor disorders, such as diffuse oesophageal spasm, hypertensive lower \n\n【34】oesophageal sphincter and nutcracker oesophagus;\n\n【35】• scleroderma;\n\n【36】• obstructive lesions, such as tumours, strictures, lower oesophageal rings (Schatzki \n\n【37】rings), oesophageal webs, foreign bodies, vascular compression and mediastinal \n\n【38】masses.\n\n【39】Endoscopy is the investigation of choice for both oropharyngeal dysphagia, which is \n\n【40】typically investigated in the ear, nose and throat department, and oesophageal dysphagia, \n\n【41】which is investigated in the upper GI gastroenterology department. If endoscopy does not \n\n【42】provide the answer, or the patient refuses the test, then a contrast swallow test can be \n\n【43】done to visualize swallowing function. Videofluoroscopy is a low X-ray dose film of the \n\n【44】very fast swallowing action in the oropharynx and is useful if there is a motor problem \n\n【45】or unsafe swallow. A barium swallow is a series of images taken of the oesophagus while \n\n【46】swallowing barium contrast.\n\n【47】This patient’s symptoms are suggestive of a pharyngeal or oesophageal problem. On the \n\n【48】fluoroscopy images there is barium pooling in an oesophageal diverticulum arising from \n\n【49】the posterior midline of the upper oesophagus, the typical position for a pharyngeal \n\n【50】pouch (Zenker’s diverticulum). This is thought to be caused by spasm or uncoordinated \n\n【51】peristalsis of the upper oesophageal sphincter and is located in Killian’s triangle, formed \n\n【52】by the overlap of the oblique muscles of the inferior constrictor muscle and the transverse \n\n【53】muscle fibres of the cricopharyngeus muscle.\n\n【54】The patient’s symptoms probably reflect progressive increase in size and compressive \n\n【55】effect of the pouch. There is also increased risk of aspiration. The treatment is usually \n\n【56】surgical excision or endoscopic stapling. The cricopharyngeal muscle may be separated to \n\n【57】prevent recurrence. Complications of pouches include aspiration and, rarely, a carcinoma \n\n【58】within the pouch.\n\n【59】Diverticula in other positions are possible. A Killian–Jamieson diverticulum is a lateral \n\n【60】cervical oesophageal diverticulum just a little lower in position. Pulsion diverticula asso-11\n\n【61】ciated with abnormal oesophageal contractions sometimes form in the lower third of the \n\n【62】oesophagus. Pseudodiverticula are rare dilated glandular pouches in the mucosa of the \n\n【63】mid oesophagus associated with reflux.\n\n【64】 KEY POINTS\n\n【65】• Although endoscopy is the investigation of choice, contrast swallow tests provide \n\n【66】evidence of functional problems that may not be seen on endoscopy and often \n\n【67】underlie dysphagia.\n\n【68】• Common symptoms of a pouch are dysphagia, regurgitation and cough.This page intentionally left blank 13\n\n【69】 ", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Is an antagonist at α-adrenoceptors\n\n【4】D. Is an antagonist at dopamine D <sub>2 </sub> receptors\n\n【5】**Answer**: 20.1 B. Benzodiazepines bind to GABA <sub>A </sub> receptors to increase chloride influx and to decrease stimulation of neurons by excitatory neurotransmitters.\n\n【6】\n**Question**: 20.2 A 22-year-old woman is diagnosed with a generalized anxiety disorder.

Sleep apnea\n\n【11】**Answer**: 20.2 D. Sleep apnea is a condition of relaxed soft tissue of the posterior pharynx, which occludes the airway during sleep. Family members usually note loud snoring and episodes of apnea of affected individuals. Sedatives, alcohol, and muscle relaxants are contraindicated in these patients, because severe apnea and death may ensue.\n\n【12】\n**Question**: 20.3 A 35-year-old man complains of seeing giant spiders in the hospital room.

Triazolam\n**Answer**: 20.4 B. A short-acting benzodiazepine such as lorazepam is usually the best choice in the acute setting to arrest status epilepticus. Triazolam is used as a hypnotic agent.\n\n【23】PHARMACOLOGY PEARLS\n\n【24】 Benzodiazepines bind to the GABA <sub>A </sub> receptor complex, increasing chloride influx, rendering the cell less excitable. Because alcohol and barbiturates also bind to the GABA <sub>A </sub> receptor complex, there is cross-tolerance among these agents.\n\n【25】 Benzodiazepine overdose causes sedation, hypotension, and respiratory depression. Alcohol and barbiturates can potentiate these effects and also lead to coma and death.\n\n【26】 Acute benzodiazepine withdrawal can cause tremor, anxiety, tachycardia, hallucinations, and life-threatening seizures.\n\n【27】 Flumazenil is a competitive inhibitor of benzodiazepines and will quickly reverse its effects, sometimes inducing withdrawal symptoms.\n\n【28】#\n\n【29】", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

You have spent the last week getting to know the area and \n\n【3】some of the other medical students who are also on attachment with you. Although you were \n\n【4】feeling relaxed you are now quite nervous about your first day in the hospital. On arrival the \n\n【5】first thing you notice is how busy it is everywhere. Whole families are queuing outside a door, \n\n【6】waiting to see the doctor. Everyone is very subdued. Despite seeming exceptionally busy the \n\n【7】doctor in charge of paediatrics is extremely pleased to see you. After a brief introductory talk \n\n【8】he gives you a list of names and shows you to a big room. On one side a large group of mothers \n\n【9】and their children are sitting on benches. On the other side are a desk and an examination \n\n【10】couch. He gives you a prescription pad and then waves goodbye. Nervously you call your first \n\n【11】patient, a 5-year-old boy. His mother tells you in very stilted English that he has a sore throat \n\n【12】and painful knees. Could this be rheumatic fever? You feel out of your depth but do not know \n\n【13】what to do about it.\n\n【14】Questions\n\n【15】• Should students follow the ethical guidelines that they would follow in their own \n\n【16】country or do they not apply in the host country?\n\n【17】• Do medical schools provide guidelines for their students?\n\n【18】• What would you do in this situation?270\n\n【19】100 Cases in Clinical Ethics and Law\n\n【20】ANSWER 99\n\n【21】The ethical framework within which an individual practises medicine should not change \n\n【22】simply because they are practising in a different country. The Hippocratic Oath and the more \n\n【23】contemporary Declaration of Geneva set out ethical principles and the General Medical \n\n【24】Council echoes these principles in its guidance for medical students and doctors (Good \n\n【25】Medical Practice, 2013).\n\n【26】Electives offer students the chance to experience medicine in a different country. It enables \n\n【27】them to become more self-sufficient and can give them increased confidence. About 40% \n\n【28】of electives are spent in developing countries. Working in developing countries with severe \n\n【29】resource issues and fewer doctors provides an opportunity to gain more experience as there \n\n【30】are often more patients to learn on and more procedures which are done by junior members \n\n【31】of the team. However, it is essential that students are aware of their own limitations and \n\n【32】should not feel pressurised to perform procedures until they have been taught how to do \n\n【33】them correctly and safely. Above all a medical student must ‘do no harm’. This applies both \n\n【34】in the UK and when working abroad. When students are unsure of what to do and do not \n\n【35】feel they have the necessary knowledge or experience they should seek help or supervision. \n\n【36】Attempting to perform a procedure or treat a patient when a student is not sure of what they \n\n【37】are doing is both potentially harmful for the patient and not educational for the student. \n\n【38】The BMA states that ‘where students believe they are being asked to act beyond their clinical \n\n【39】competence they should politely but firmly decline’ (BMA Ethics and Medical Electives in \n\n【40】Resource Poor Countries: A Toolkit 2009).\n\n【41】Medical treatment is often seen as a privilege in developing countries, and while patients may \n\n【42】seem grateful for attention, they are still owed the same respect that a patient would receive \n\n【43】in the UK. They should be told that you are a medical student and not a qualified doctor and \n\n【44】their informed consent should be sought for any procedure they undergo. Medical students \n\n【45】abroad are representatives of their country and medical school and it is important that they \n\n【46】should behave in a mature and responsible way. Professional values should be the same as \n\n【47】those used at home. Students should be dressed respectably, even in hot weather. They should \n\n【48】be polite and courteous to patients, their relatives and everyone else working in the hospital.\n\n【49】Electives can be an amazing and memorable experience. Students should not let preventable \n\n【50】bad experiences impact on the rest of their medical career.\n\n【51】Key Points\n\n【52】• Electives abroad are a useful learning experience and an opportunity to experi￾ence a different culture.\n\n【53】• Medical students should follow the same ethical principles that they do when \n\n【54】working in the UK.\n\n【55】• Students should never perform procedures they are not able to do without \n\n【56】appropriate supervision.271\n\n【57】Faith, Values and Culture\n\n【58】", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The specific causative organism is usually not definitively established， so empiric antimicrobial therapy will need to be initiated and the patient response monitored. It will also be necessary to risk stratify the****HEALTH CARE-ASSOCIATED PNEUMONIA (HCAP)： Pneumonia develop-ing 48 hours after admission that was not present prior to admission. The previous concept of HCAP has since fallen out of favor due to its inability to be sensitive or specific in identifying patients who might be at risk. HCAP was previously defined as pneumonia occurring in a nonhospitalized patient with extensive health care con-tact， including one of the following： intravenous therapy， wound care， intravenous chemotherapy within the prior 30 days， those who live in a nursing home or other long-term care facility， hospitalization in an acute care hospital for 2 or more days within the prior 90 days， or attendance at a hospital or hemodialysis clinic within the prior 30 days. Recently， terminology has changed so that nursing home patients who develop pneumonia is called CAP.****VENTILATOR-ASSOCIATED PNEUMONIA： Pneumonia that develops48 hours after intubation.****Risk Stratification. Once the clinical diagnosis of infectious pneumonia has been made， the next step is to risk stratify the patients to determine which patients can be treated safely as outpatients with oral antibiotics and which require hospitalization. Two major risk stratification tools are currently employeds： the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) and the CURB-65. The PSI stratifies patients into five groups based on a 30-day all-cause mortality in those with radiographically proven pneumonia. This two-step processes involves first using patient demographic factors：- age> 50， medical history comorbidities， and physical examination findings—to deter-mine low-risk patients (risk class I： outpatient treatment). Patients possessing these factors progress to step 2， which utilizes objective laboratory findings to further classify patients in classes II to IV based on the number of points assigned per risk factor. Scoring is determined by taking the age (subtract 10 in women) and adding a point for each risk factor. The other stages are as follows： class II (scores <70)， class III (score 71-90)， class IV (scores 91-130)， and class V (scores > 130). Patients in classes I and II have a predicted mortality of less than 0.6% and are suit-able for outpatient treatment， while patients in class V have a 30-day mortality risk of 27%. Calculating PSI is laborious，**\n\n【10】**The CURB-65 serves as a simplified prognostic score using five variables：**\n\n【11】**Confusion (1 point)**\n\n【12】**Urea greater than 20 mg/dL (1 point)**\n\n【13】**Respiratory rate greater than 30 breaths/min (1 point)**\n\n【14】**Blood pressure， systolic less than 90 mm Hg (1 point)**\n\n【15】**Age greater than 65(1 point)**\n\n【16】**Patients with a score of 0 to 1 have a 30-day mortality below 3%， and they can usually be safely treated as outpatients with oral antibiotics. However， further analysis should be performed to ensure the patient's ability to take oral medications and the availability of outpatient support. Scores of 2 or greater require hospital-ization， and those of 3 or greater should be assessed for intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Patients with a score of 3 or greater have a 30-day mortality of 15% to40%. Compared to PSI， CURB-65 assigns no points to comorbid illnesses； another limitation of CURB-65 is that it assumes that the confusion is related to the acute pneumonia.****Laboratory Results. Microbiologic studies， such as blood cultures and sputum Gram stain and culture， should be obtained to try to establish the etiology. Sputum samples are frequently contaminated by oral flora， limiting their value， though their diagnostic yield increases when sputum is purulent (> 25 polymorphonuclear cells and < 10 epithelial cells per low-power field). Additionally， blood cultures can fur-ther classify the etiology of pneumonia， especially since 30% to 40% of pneumococ-cal pneumonia patients are bacteremic on admission. Further serologic studies can diagnose patients who are infected with organisms not easily cultured， for example， _Legionella， Mycoplasma， or C. pneumoniae._****Initially， empiric treatment is based on the most common organisms given the clini-cal scenario. Macrolide antibiotics (azithromycin)， doxycycline， or antipneumococ-cal fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin or levofloxacin) are good choices for outpatient treatment of CAP caused by S. pneumoniae， M. pneumoniae， and other common bacterial organisms. Keep in mind that increasing community resistance patterns alter available antibiotic coverage. In regard to outpatient therapy duration， antibi-otics should be administered for a minimum of 5 days. Hospitalized patients with CAP usually require intravenous third-generation cephalosporin plus a macrolide(or antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone). For immunocompetent patients with hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated pneumonias， initial antibiotic coverage is broader， with more serious antibiotic coverage. Some common antimicrobials cho-sen include piperacillin-tazobactam， cefepime， levofloxacin， imipenem， or merope-nem. In addition， for patients with risk factors for MRSA infection (ie， prior intravenous antibiotic use， intravenous drug usage， recent ventilatory support)， empiric coverage for MRSA such as vancomycin or linezolid should be added. Vac-cination for influenza and pneumococcus should be considered for all who meet the criteria. Smoking cessation is also an integral part of postrecovery care.****Aspiration Pneumonia. Aspiration pneumonia refers to the inflammation pro-moted by infectious agents that results from abnormal entry of fluids or secre-tions into the lower airways when defensive mechanisms of the upper airway fail. It should be noted that many healthy adults frequently aspirate small volumes of oropharyngeal secretions while sleeping (this is the primary way tha131t bacteria gainentry to the lungs)， but the material is cleared by coughing， ciliary transport， or normal immune defenses so that no clinical infection results. The affected lobe of the lung depends on the patient’'s position： In recumbent patients， the posterior segments of the upper lobes and superior segments of the lower lobes are most common.**\n\n【17】**Chemical Pneumonitis. Chemical pneumonitis refers to the aspiration of toxic substances (the most common being gastric acid) into the lower airway without the development of bacterial infection. The inflammation is proportional to the volume of the aspirate and the acidity of the content. The clinical presentation can go from minor dyspnea and low-grade fever to severe respiratory distress and a pul-monary infiltrate that is apparent within 4 to 6 hours and typically resolves within48 hours. Aspiration of gastric contents is most likely to occur in patients with a depressed level of consciousness， such as with anesthesia， drug overdose， intoxi-cation， or a postictal state. This process has also been described among victims of smoke inhalation. Treatment for chemical pneumonitis is usually supportive and involves positive pressure breathing， intravenous fluids， and tracheal suction.**\n\n【18】**Infectious pneumonia should be considered in those who fail to show clinical improvement after 48 hours of presumed chemical pneumonitis； those with sig-nificant comorbidities can be started on antibiotics initially. In contrast to chemical pneumonitis， where aspiration of vomitus may be witnessed， the aspiration of oral secretions typically is silent and should be suspected when any institutionalized patient with dysphagia presents with respiratory symptoms and pulmonary infil-trate in a dependent segment of the lung.**See also Case 14 (Pulmonary Embolism)， Case 15 (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease)， Case 16 (Chronic Cough/Asthma)， Case 17 (Pleural Effusion， Parapneumonic)， and Case 18 (Hemoptysis/Lung Cancer).\n", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The latter was diagnosed by the general practitioner (GP) when he was \n\n【3】6 months old. He has been treated with a variety of emollients and topical steroids which are \n\n【4】applied on an intermittent, as-required basis. The parents report that over the past 3 days, the \n\n【5】eczema has gradually deteriorated and also become more itchy. George also has asthma, which \n\n【6】is treated with inhaled beclomethasone twice a day and inhaled salbutamol on an as-required \n\n【7】basis. His mother had eczema as a child but grew out of it and his father has hay fever.\n\n【8】Examination\n\n【9】George is well hydrated. His temperature is 38.3°C, he is itchy and miserable. He has wide￾spread eczema all over his body, which is worst on his face, hands and arms where the skin \n\n【10】feels moist (see Figure 46.1). A number of vesicles and some punched-out lesions can be seen \n\n【11】on the face, hands and arms. There are also pustules and some areas of honey-coloured crust￾ing in those areas. In some areas, the lesions have coalesced. The marked scratching that has \n\n【12】taken place makes the exact nature of the lesions more difficult to determine. His eyes are \n\n【13】puffy and there are some surrounding lesions. The eyes themselves appear normal but are \n\n【14】difficult to assess fully. There is cervical, axillary and inguinal lymphadenopathy.

Skin swabs should be taken for bacteriology and \n\n【36】virology (virology swabs require special viral medium).\n\n【37】The diagnosis is eczema herpeticum with superadded bacterial infection. It would be worth \n\n【38】asking if the child has had similar previous episodes or if anyone in the family has herpetic \n\n【39】cold sores. Eczema herpeticum is caused by herpes simplex virus infection of eczematous \n\n【40】skin. The infection spreads along the skin and haematogenously. Vesicles and pustules occur \n\n【41】and these may coalesce, erode the skin and become haemorrhagic and crusted. The lesions \n\n【42】can disseminate rapidly and may cause life-threatening infection. Eczema herpeticum may \n\n【43】also affect the conjunctiva and cornea, and can cause a keratitis that, if left untreated, may lead \n\n【44】to blindness. The diagnosis is sometimes made when a patient fails to respond to antibacterial \n\n【45】therapy. The raised temperature, WCC and CRP indicate that the infection is severe, and the \n\n【46】lymphocytosis is suggestive of a viral infection. The diagnosis can be made by microscopy, \n\n【47】culture or viral polymerase chain reaction.\n\n【48】Bacterial infection can also lead to an acute deterioration in eczema (and is more common \n\n【49】than herpetic infection). The pathogen is usually Staphylococcus aureus and occasionally \n\n【50】Streptococcus. Staphylococcal infection can lead to honey-coloured crusting, as in this case. \n\n【51】In George’s case, the secondary bacterial infection is most likely to be due to scratching, lead￾ing to the Staphylococcus that often colonizes the skin, causing infection.\n\n【52】In some cases, it can be difficult to determine if the eczema has been infected by bacteria or \n\n【53】viruses and both need to be treated.\n\n【54】The lymphadenopathy is secondary to the infected eczema.\n\n【55】In some cases of widespread infected eczema, there can be marked fluid loss from the skin, \n\n【56】which may be exacerbated in the presence of a temperature. In this case, George is well \n\n【57】hydrated, but hydration should be carefully monitored (the situation is somewhat analogous \n\n【58】to fluid loss in a burn). Intravenous aciclovir should be administered in severe cases such as \n\n【59】this one. In less severe cases, oral aciclovir can be used. If there is any concern about possible \n\n【60】eye involvement, as in this case, an urgent ophthalmic opinion should be sought. In addition, \n\n【61】intravenous antibiotics (e.g. co-amoxiclav) should be given because of the superadded bacte￾rial skin infection and possible septicaemia. Analgesics, antipyretics and anti-pruritic agents, \n\n【62】i.e. antihistamines, should be prescribed. Topical treatment with steroids is not associated \n\n【63】with poorer outcomes or longer hospital stay, but the evidence for benefit is not as clear as \n\n【64】with bacterial infections alone, when steroid creams are usually continued alongside the anti￾biotic. If continued, they should be reserved for the most inflamed areas. If stopped, topical \n\n【65】steroid treatment can usually be restarted once the systemic symptoms have abated, usually \n\n【66】within 2–3 days of systemic antiviral and antibiotic treatment.\n\n【67】Key Points\n\n【68】• Herpetic infection can lead to severe worsening of eczema (eczema herpeticum).\n\n【69】• Bacterial infection is the commonest cause for an acute deterioration in eczema, \n\n【70】with the commonest pathogen being Staphylococcus aureus.145\n\n【71】", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

{"seq_id": "935b1d4d-56b7-4471-98d9-72f48e9128fa", "title": null, "text": "【0】\nDysglycemia\n-----------\n\n【1】The prevalence of dysglycemia is increased in acromegaly. As many as 30% of patients may have frank diabetes, and a similar percentage have impaired glucose tolerance \\[ 1 , 30 \\].\n\n【2】Pituitary surgery resulting in normalization of IGF-1 has been shown to normalize HbA1c in almost 50% of patients \\[ 32 \\]. In those in whom diabetes persists, treatment is accepted to be the same as for type 2 diabetes in general – lowering HbA1c while avoiding hypoglycemia – and metformin is the usual first-line drug therapy \\[ 1 \\]. Until recently, a sulfonylurea or insulin has been the most common additional treatment, but the availability of antihyperglycemic agents that reduce cardiovascular risk and at the same time are less likely to cause hypoglycemia, brings a new dimension. GLP-1 receptor agonists have been shown to decrease cardiovascular risk in the general diabetes population \\[ 33 , 34 \\] and would seem to be a logical second-line therapy in acromegalic patients, though we know of no published studies supporting this. Sodium glucose co-transporter inhibitors (SGLT-2i) have also been shown to decrease cardiovascular risk in diabetes, but caution is required in acromegaly because of risk of inducing diabetic ketoacidosis \\[ 35 , 36 \\]. The increased availability of free fatty acids in acromegaly likely plays a pathophysiologic role in this.\n\n【3】The medical treatment of persistent elevation of GH and IGF-1 following surgery is another factor that can influence diabetes. SLRs will generally be expected to have little effect on glycemic control, since the potential benefit of decreased insulin resistance as GH levels decrease may be counterbalanced by suppression of insulin secretion. Fasting glucose and HbA1c levels are generally unchanged, but postprandial glucose may increase \\[ 37 \\]. Occasionally however, with octreotide or lanreotide, glycemic control can worsen, so careful glucose monitoring is advisable.\n\n【4】Pasireotide , a multi-receptor-targeted somatostatin analogue, with greatly increased binding affinity for the somatostatin receptor subtype 5 (SSTR5) compared to octreotide, has been shown to decrease GH and IGF-1 more effectively, but at the potential cost of inducing hyperglycemia and worsening glycemic control in patients with diabetes \\[ 38 \\]. Baseline glucose, older age, and features of metabolic syndrome such as hypertension and dyslipidemia are predictive of the likely development of hyperglycemia \\[ 38 , 39 \\]. The likely mechanism is the greater binding affinity to SSTR5 than to SSTR2; both of these receptor subtypes are found on the insulin-secreting beta cells of the pancreatic islets, while SSTR2 predominates on the glucagon-secreting alpha cells. There also is inhibition of incretin secretion by pasireotide. Therefore, insulin secretion is negatively impacted to a much greater degree than glucagon, a hormone antagonistic to insulin, resulting in hyperglycemia. Careful consideration therefore is required when weighing the potential benefits of pasireotide treatment in acromegaly against the potential hyperglycemic risk, particularly in those patients with metabolic syndrome.\n\n【5】The GH receptor antagonist pegvisomant , on the other hand, has been shown to be associated with improvement in glycemic control \\[ 40 , 41 \\]. One study showed a decrease in HbA1c of >1.0% in patients with acromegaly and diabetes during 6 months of pegvisomant treatment. The mechanism is felt to be increased insulin sensitivity due to decreased activation of GH receptors. Higher doses of pegvisomant are typically required to normalize IGF-1 in patients with diabetes than in those without. The reason for this may be that the hyperinsulinism associated with type 2 diabetes and treatment with insulin will increase the number of GH receptors on the hepatocytes and hence also liver sensitivity to GH \\[ 42 \\]. Fasting glucose and HbA1c may decrease after addition of pegvisomant to octreotide or lanreotide treatment. However, in a study of combination treatment (pegvisomant plus SSA), fasting glucose and HbA1c increased over a 12-week period when pasireotide was substituted for either octreotide or lanreotide \\[ 43 \\].\n\n【6】A recent consensus statement suggested that all acromegalic patients should be screened for dysglycemia at diagnosis, with continuing monitoring during follow-up, and that treatment of hyperglycemia is essential for optimal outcome \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【7】Dyslipidemia\n------------\n\n【8】Several studies have demonstrated that dyslipidemia is common in patients with active acromegaly \\[ 44 , 45 \\]. Increases in total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, VLDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, and lipoprotein(a) and decreased HDL-cholesterol in comparison to control populations have all been described, with perhaps hypertriglyceridemia and increased lipoprotein(a) being the most common. Controlling acromegaly – normalizing IGF-1 – may restore these abnormalities to normal \\[ 46 \\].\n\n【9】Recent endocrine society guidelines have endorsed the need to measure lipid profile before and after treatment of acromegaly \\[ 47 \\]. For persistent dyslipidemia in acromegaly, the use of statin drugs has been shown to be effective in improving the lipid profile \\[ 48 \\]. We would suggest that the aim should be to reduce LDL-cholesterol to <70 mg/dL, as is the case in patients with diabetes.\n\n【10】_In our case, diagnosis of hyperlipidemia was made approximately a year before the diagnosis of acromegaly, when treatment with atorvastatin 40 mg was started. The LDL-C had an excellent response to atorvastatin which was continued after transsphenoidal surgery and maintained LDL-cholesterol just above 70 mg/dL. HbA1c, while not normal, has not been in the diabetes range and did not change after surgery. Fasting glucose decreased to within the normal range. He has not been treated_ _with any antihyperglycemic agent._\n\n【11】Sleep Apnea\n-----------\n\n【12】Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a condition that affects 20–80% of patients with acromegaly \\[ 49 , 50 \\]. Most of the cases, about two thirds, are due to the obstructive form where patients with acromegaly may develop soft tissue swelling of the airways and changes in the craniofacial bones. The remaining one third of cases are due to central sleep apnea where brain control of respiration is affected by elevated GH and IGF-1 levels. People with sleep apnea are at increased risk of hypertension and stroke \\[ 51 \\].\n\n【13】A recent meta-analysis found that the apnea hypopnea index (AHI) in patients with acromegaly and OSA did improve after short-term treatment of GH excess in longitudinal studies. However, overall, the prevalence of OSA and the AHI were not significantly different between patients with active and inactive disease \\[ 52 \\]. It is possible that changes to the upper respiratory airways may not be fully reversible and may account for this finding. Other comorbidities that develop during the course of acromegaly such as obesity, heart failure, type 2 diabetes, and arrhythmias may also contribute.\n\n【14】Hypopituitarism\n---------------\n\n【15】Patients with acromegaly who present with macroadenomas may have hypopituitarism.\n\n【16】The rate of hypopituitarism following surgical resection for the treatment of acromegaly was found to be 12.79% (95% CI 9.88–16.00%) in a meta- analysis \\[ 53 \\]. The rate of hypopituitarism following radiation is approximately 40% in the first 10 years. The most common deficiency is of gonadotropins followed by corticotropin and then thyroid stimulating hormone deficiency \\[ 54 \\].\n\n【17】The mainstay of treatment of hypopituitarism is replacement of the deficient hormones which can impact the cardiometabolic risk factors. There is potential for over-treatment of adrenal insufficiency with glucocorticoids. It has been recognized that patients continue to experience increased rates of morbidity and premature mortality due to non-physiological and glucocorticoid over treatment \\[ 55 , 56 \\]. Modified-release hydrocortisone formulations have recently been developed as cortisol replacement therapy which may help ameliorate these effects. In contrast, insufficient thyroid hormone replacement may contribute to dyslipidemia and increased cardiovascular risk \\[ 57 \\]. Low testosterone levels may be associated with dyslipidemia and other markers of increased cardiovascular risk, such as hypertension and increased inflammatory markers \\[ 58 \\]. Yet, there continues to be controversy over whether or not testosterone therapy may increase cardiovascular risk. This is probably due to the increasing use of testosterone in aging men in the absence of pituitary or gonadal disease.\n\n【18】_In our case, after pituitary_ _surgery and treatment with a long-acting somatostatin receptor ligand, his sleep apnea resolved. Periodic monitoring of free T4, testosterone, as well as cortisol levels was continued to ensure appropriate replacement and to determine whether ACTH deficiency occurs as a result of radiation. In addition, metabolic and cardiovascular_ _parameters are being closely followed._\n\n【19】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【20】The concept that acromegaly increases cardiometabolic risk has been well established. Attention to all aspects of the condition is necessary to try to eliminate the risk. We believe that efforts to reduce the delay in diagnosis of acromegaly would constitute the single most beneficial step forward so that the cascade of factors contributing to increased cardiometabolic risk could be mitigated.\n\n【21】", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Learn the clinical signs and symptoms associated with heat-related illness.\n\n【11】2\\. Learn the management and treatment of heat-related illness.\n\n【12】**_Considerations_**\n\n【13】When evaluating hyperthermic patients， the clinician must first determine if the patient has a fever or suffering from heat stroke. The presumptive diagnosis of heat stroke can be made on the basis of environmental conditions and circumstantial evidence (hot day， enclosed apartment without air conditioning or adequate venti-lation)， and the next step is to determine the severity of the patient's heat-related illness， which could be useful in guiding his treatment. Because heat stroke has a mortality of 10% to 20% even with treatment， it is essential to diagnose and begin therapy immediately. This patient has severe heatstroke， as evidenced by his altered mental status and seizure. Simultaneously， laboratory and radiographic stud-ies should be performed to rule-out infectious etiologies and drug overdoses.\n\n【14】**DEFINITIONS**\n\n【15】HEAT STRESS： Feeling of discomfort and physiologic strain with normal core temperatures. These patients exhibit decreased exercise tolerance and no other symptoms.\n\n【16】HEAT EXHAUSTION： Mild dehydration， with or without sodium abnormalities. Patients have profuse sweating， thirst， nausea， vomiting， confusion and headache， and may have collapsed. Core temperatures range from38℃ to 40°℃(100°F-104°F). Generally， the victim is not able to continue his/her activities as the result of the environmental conditions.\n\n【17】HEAT STROKE： Severe dehydration with core temperature greater than 40℃. Patients are flushed， with hot， dry skin. Symptoms include those associated with CNS disturbances such as dizziness， vertigo， syncope， confusion， delirium， and unconsciousness. Classically， heat strokes develop slowly over days and occur more frequently in older individuals with chronic illnesses.\n\n【18】EXERTIONAL HEAT STROKE： Heat stroke affecting individuals involved in strenuous physical activities. This type of heat stroke can have a more rapid onset than non-exertional heat strokes. Weather conditions including high humidity and increased temperatures are risk factors. The at-risk individuals are highly motivated athletes， laborers， and soldiers.\n\n【19】**CLINICAL APPROACH**\n\n【20】The primary abnormality in heat-related illnesses is the individual's inability to adequately transfer heat (produced from normal metabolic activities) to the envi-ronment resulting in an increase in core temperature. Risk factors for developing heat illness include ambient heat and humidity， extremes of age， strenuous exer-cise， cardiovascular disease， dehydration， obesity， impaired mentation， and various medications (eg， diuretics， anticholinergics， antihistamines， phenothiazines， cyclic antidepressants， sympathomimetics， alcohol).\n\n【21】The spectrum of heat-related illness varies in severity from benign to severe. Table 45-1 describes the minor syndromes. In contrast to these benign entities， heat stroke is characterized by a loss of thermoregulation， tissue damage， and multiorgan failure. Classically， patients present with hyperpyrexia (temperature>41℃ \\[106°F\\])， central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction (eg， altered mental status， seizure， focal neurological deficits)， and anhidrosis.\n\n【22】_Diagnosis_\n\n【23】Diagnosing heat stroke is largely a matter of ruling out other causes of hyperthermia with concomitant CNS dysfunction. The differential includes alcohol withdrawal； salicylate toxicity； phencyclidine， cocaine， and amphetamine toxicity； tetanus； sepsis； neuroleptic malignant syndrome； encephalitis， meningitis， and brain abscess； malaria； typhoid fever； malignant hyperthermia； anticholinergic toxicity； status epilepticus； cerebral hemorrhage； diabetic ketoacidosis； and thyroid storm.\n\n【24】Laboratory studies should include complete blood count， electrolytes， blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine， glucose， liver enzymes， coagulation studies， urinalysis， urine myoglobin， and arterial blood gas. An electrocardiogram (ECG) should be considered if the patient has syncope or a history of cardiovascular disease. Chest radiographs are useful to rule out aspiration or any pulmonary infection. CT scan of the head and/or lumbar puncture may also be needed.\n\n【25】**_Treatment_**\n\n【26】In treating heat stroke， the clinician should strive to stabilize the ABCs， commence rapid cooling， replace fluid and electrolyte losses， and treat any complications. The goal is to cool the patient to 40℃ (104°F) to avoid overshoot hypothermia. There are a number of cooling methods that are applied and these can be divided\n\n【27】| **Table 45-1·MINORHEATILLNESSES**  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Diagnosis**  | **Cause**  | **Symptoms**  | **Treatment**  |\n| **Heat edema**  | **Vasodilation andpooling of fluids independent areas**  | **Mild swelling of handsand feet**  | **Self-limited； elevate legs，use of support hose；no diuretics**  |\n| **Heat rash**  | **Blockage of sweatgland pores， mayhave secondarystaphylococcal** **infection**  | **Pruritic， erythematous，maculopapular rash onclothed areas**  | **Antihistamines for** **itching， loose-fittingclothing； chlorhexidinecream， dicloxacillin， or** **erythromycin if infected**  |\n| **Heat cramps**  | **Salt depletion (oftenfrom drinking onlywater**  | **Severe muscle crampsin fatigued skeletal** **muscles (usually calves，thighs， shoulders)** **during or after strenuousexercise**  | **Fluid and salt replace-ment， rest**  |\n| **Heat syncope**  | **Vasodilation，** **decreased vasomotortone， volu me depletion**  | **Postural hypotensionand syncope**  | **Removal from heat** **source， rehydration，rest**  |\n| **Heat exhaustion**  | **Water and saltdepletion**  | **Sweating， weakness，tatigue， headache， nau-sea， dizziness， malaise，lightheadedness，tem-perature usually <40℃(104°F)**  | **Rest， volume， and saltreplacement**  |\n\n【28】categorically as evaporative techniques and conduction techniques. Although there are strong proponents for the different cooling methods， there is no current con-sensus regarding which of the techniques is most effective. In all patients， the ini-tial measures consist of removing the patient from the hot environment if possible and removing clothing. Evaporative cooling using cool mist and fans is simple and effective approach to cooling in the field； the evaporative approach is advocated by a number of investigators because the physical cooling principle suggests that the evap-oration of 1 ml of water is associated with seven times the amount of heat dissipa-tion when compared to melting 1 g of ice. Alternative cooling methods also include ice packs to the groin and axillae， cooling blankets， ice water immersion， peritoneal lavage， and cardiopulmonary bypass. Antipyretics are not effective in this scenario.\n\n【29】In addition， shivering can be controlled with benzodiazepines or phenothi-azines. Benzodiazepines can also be used to treat any seizures. If the laboratory stud-ies reveal evidence of rhabdomyolysis， mannitol and alkalinization of the urine are other considerations. The most common complications of heat stroke are rhabdo-myolysis， renal failure， liver failure， disseminated intravascular coagulation， heart failure， pulmonary edema， and cardiovascular collapse.\n\n【30】The following independent negative prognosticators for survival have been iden-tified， and these include age >80 years， cardiac disease， cancer， core temperature>40°C， living in an institutions， previous diuretic use， systolic BP <100 mm Hg， GCS <12， and transport to hospital by ambulance.\n", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

For this patient with chronic altered mental status due to underlying medical conditions； therefore， the approach to clear his C-spine is one directed toward obtunded patients. His C-spine can be cleared based on a normal CT of the C-spine alone， which is sufficient to identify greater than 99% of all vertebral bony fractures/dislocations. An MRI can be added to identify the rare instances of isolated ligamentous injuries if the CT is normal. There is no consensus on whether MRI is indicated in this setting.\n\n【24】9.2 B. The Canadian C-spine rule (CCR) is an approach developed for the clear-ance of C-spines in asymptomatic patients following low mechanism events. The CCR has been compared to the NEXUS criteria and found to be more specific and sensitive in clearance of the C-spine.\n\n【25】9.3 C. This patient has signs consistent with neurogenic shock following a high spinal cord injury. The first concerns are his airway and ventilation. The airway appears to be clear but he needs a definitive airway to maintain optimal ventila-tion. Orotracheal intubation with rapid sequence induction and in-line C-spine stabilization is the optimal airway strategy for this patient. Maintenance of ade-quate pulse and blood pressure are important to maintain spinal cord perfusion， but these steps should be delayed until a secured airway is established.\n\n【26】9.4 C. The Brown-Sequard syndrome is caused by posterior spinal cord injury， char-acterized by paralysis， loss of vibratory sensation and proprioception on the ipsi-lateral side， and loss of pain and temperature sensation on the contralateral side.

Succinylcholine transiently increases serum potassium levels. It is presump-tively contraindicated in renal failure patients who often have elevated potas-sium levels. Acute burns are not a contraindication. Beginning 2 to 3 days after a burn， acetylcholine receptor upregulation can lead to hyperkalemia. Neither coronary artery disease nor sepsis is a contraindication to the use of succinylcholine.\n\n【22】54.3 B. This patient displays signs of impending airway obstruction. His worsen-ing airway edema， despite appropriate medical therapy， dictates intubation before complete airway occlusion and a cricothyroidotomy is required. There is no wheezing to suggest bronchoconstriction that could be treated with a bronchodilator such as albuterol. Stridor is a worrisome sign of upper airway obstruction. Normal respiratory rate and oxygen saturation should not delay intubation as falling oxygen saturation is a late sign of respiratory failure. Cricothyroidotomy is only indicated after all other measures have failed.\n\n【23】54.4 C. The most common cause of airway obstruction is the tongue and/or soft tissues of the upper airway. No other adjuncts may be necessary for initial management except relieving the obstruction with airway repositioning. This should certainly be the first step， and there is no need to wait for the code cart before performing this maneuver. There is no indication for chest compres-sions in a patient with palpable pulses. The patient will require BVM ventila-tion after airway repositioning and placement of an oral airway. If the patient is easy to ventilate， reversible causes of respiratory depression， such as a narcotic overdose， should be investigated and may eliminate the need for RSI.\n\n【24】**CLINICAL PEARLS**\n\n【25】**Remember the noninvasive maneuvers and interventions that may eliminate the need for intubation： nasopharyngeal airways， chin lift， suction， BiPAP.**\n\n【26】Always have suction available.\n\n【27】Bag-valve-mask ventilation is a lifesaving intervention for almost all patients with respiratory failure-know how to do it!\n\n【28】Use an oral airway when bagging a patient.\n\n【29】Head position is key for both basic and advanced airway management.\n\n【30】Take time to thoroughly prepare for RSl.

Urinalysis shows many red blood cells, a few white blood cells, and oval-shaped eggs with terminal spines.\n\n【8】• Organism likely cause of his hematuria: _Schistosoma haematobium_ .\n\n【9】• Method organism gains entry into humans: Penetration through intact skin by the cercarial stage of the organism.\n\n【10】### CLINICAL CORRELATION\n\n【11】Schistosomiasis is a human disease syndrome caused by infection with one of several parasitic trematodes or flukes of the genus _Schistosoma_ . These parasites are known commonly as blood flukes because the adult worms live in blood vessels of the definitive host. The human disease syndrome is characterized by dermatitis that is caused by entry of the infective stage and by acute and chronic systemic symptoms caused by host responses to eggs deposited by adult worms. _S. haematobium, S. mansoni_ , and _S. japonicum_ are the major species that infect more than 200 million humans in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and South America. _Schistosoma japonicum_ is considered a zoonotic infection. In addition to these 3 major species, others, such as _S. mekongi_ and _S. intercalatum_ , also with potential zoonotic properties, rarely infect humans. Schistosomes with avian or nonhuman mammalian hosts can cause severe dermatitis or swimmer’s itch but not infection in humans with adult worms.\n\n【12】The disease syndrome parallels the development of the parasite in the definitive host. Swimmer’s itch, an allergic dermatitis, is caused shortly after humans make skin contact with microscopic, infective larval forms called cercariae that live in an aquatic environment. Following exposure to human schistosomes, the dermatitis is mild and may go unnoticed. However, when exposed to cercariae of schistosomes that normally infect birds, swimmer’s itch can present as an itchy maculopapular rash. Cercariae penetrate the intact skin, enter the circulation and migrate to the liver, where they mature into adult male and female worms. The adult worms migrate via the bloodstream to their final locations. _S. mansoni_ and _S. japonicum_ descend to the mesenteric veins and _S. haematobium_ to the vesical plexus. Gravid female worms may release 300 to 3000 eggs per day during a 5- to 10-year life span. Eggs of _S. haematobium_ can work their way through the wall of the urinary bladder into the lumen and are eliminated in urine, while eggs of _S. mansoni_ and _S. japonicum_ work their way through the walls of the small intestine and colon and are voided in feces. Acute schistosomiasis or Katayama syndrome develops 1 to 2 months after initial infection and includes fever, chills, abdominal pain, lymphadenopathy, and hepatomegaly and splenomegaly. The pathophysiologic etiology of acute schistosomiasis is not known. However, the association of its manifestations with heavy infection suggests that it is a form of serum sickness as a result of circulating antigen-antibody complexes. Chronic schistosomiasis results from the inflammatory response to the presence of eggs, with granulomas, fibrosis, and scarring around the eggs; additionally, chronic infection associated with risk of the bladder cancer, specifically, squamous cell carcinoma (as opposed to the more common transitional cell cancer). Eggs in the bowel wall may result in symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and blood in the stool. Schistosomiasis of the bladder can cause hematuria, dysuria, frequent urination, and a reduction in bladder capacity. With intestinal schistosomiasis, the liver is frequently involved as a result of eggs being carried by the portal circulation and becoming trapped in the liver. Pathology involves inflammation and fibrosis, leading to cirrhosis with resulting portal hypertension, splenomegaly, ascites, and abdominal and esophageal varices. Ectopic lesions may rarely be associated with eggs reaching the brain, lungs, or both.\n\n【13】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【14】#### The Suspected Schistome Infection\n\n【15】### OBJECTIVES\n\n【16】1\\. Learn the life cycle of blood flukes and the epidemiology and clinical course of infection.\n\n【17】2\\. Describe 3 basic aspects of infection: transmission, diagnosis, and treatment/prevention.\n\n【18】### DEFINITIONS\n\n【19】CERCARIA: Infective, aquatic larval form of schistosomes; characterized by a forked tail\n\n【20】MIRACIDIUM: Ciliated larval form of schistosomes (and other flukes) that escapes from the egg and infects a snail intermediate host\n\n【21】INTERMEDIATE HOST: The host in the life cycle of a helminth that harbors the larval stage(s) of the parasite\n\n【22】BILHARZIASIS: A synonym for schistosomiasis\n\n【23】SWIMMER’S ITCH: Dermatitis in humans caused by cercariae penetrating the skin, commonly involving cercariae of schistosomes that parasitize birds or mammals but which cannot complete their life cycle in humans\n\n【24】DIOECIOUS FLUKE: A fluke that has separate sexes, as opposed to hermaphroditic flukes\n\n【25】### DISCUSSION\n\n【26】_Characteristics of Schistosomes That Impact Transmission_\n\n【27】The life cycle of all human schistosomes is similar, except in fine details. Eggs voided in feces or urine hatch in fresh water, releasing ciliated miracidia that penetrate a snail intermediate host. The species of snail varies with the species of schistosome. Miracidia undergo morphologic development through other larval stages, eventually reproducing asexually. The product is hundreds of cercariae with forked tails that emerge from the snail and swim freely. On contacting humans that enter their environment, the cercariae penetrate the intact skin, losing their tails in the process, and enter the circulation and are disseminated to all parts of the body.\n\n【28】The cercariae, now termed schistosomula, are carried via the portal vein into the intrahepatic portal system, where they mature in approximately 3 to 4 weeks. After maturing, the worms migrate against the blood current and move into branches of veins that drain the urinary bladder ( _S. hematobium_ ), the lower ileum and cecum ( _S. japonicum_ ) or the colon ( _S. mansoni_ ). Female worms lay several hundred eggs per day. The eggs of each species have characteristic morphology. All eggs leaving the host contain a fully developed miracidium.\n\n【29】### DIAGNOSIS\n\n【30】Infections can be definitively diagnosed by finding characteristic eggs in the urine or feces. Eggs of _S. hematobium_ are in the shape of an elongated oval with a terminal spine. _S. mansoni_ eggs are also oval shaped but with a distinct lateral spine. _S. japonicum_ eggs are round to oval with a short lateral spine or knob that often is unseen. In suspected cases where stools are negative, eggs of _S. mansoni_ may be seen in microscopic examination following rectal biopsy.\n\n【31】### TREATMENT AND PREVENTION\n\n【32】Praziquantel is the drug of choice in the treatment of human schistosomiasis and is effective against all human species. Because the drug has been reported to be effective as a prophylactic, larval stages and adult forms are presumed to be susceptible. The treatment of cercarial dermatitis is symptomatic. Prevention is based on avoiding skin exposure to groundwater in endemic areas.\n\n【33】### SYNOPSIS\n\n【34】The synopsis of schistosomiasis is presented in Table 49-1 .\n\n【35】Table 49-1 • SYNOPSIS OF SCHISTOSOMIASIS\n\n【36】### ", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

She \n\n【3】is 17 weeks’ gestation in her third pregnancy. The previous two pregnancies were terminated \n\n【4】medically in the first trimester using prostaglandins. This pregnancy was unplanned but she \n\n【5】is now looking forward to being a mother.\n\n【6】She had a small amount of bleeding at around 7 weeks, which persisted until 9 weeks. \n\n【7】Ultrasound scan at 7 weeks showed a single viable embryo.\n\n【8】She booked for antenatal care late at 13 weeks. The combined test for Down’s syndrome \n\n【9】showed low risk (1:5100). She has not yet felt any fetal movements in the pregnancy.\n\n【10】She is a non-smoker and has drunk no alcohol since finding out she was pregnant at 7 weeks. \n\n【11】She has no other significant medical history.\n\n【12】On direct questioning the vaginal loss started a few hours ago. Initially she thought it was pos￾sibly urine that was leaking but it has no smell and she is sure it is now coming from the vagina. \n\n【13】There has been a minimal amount of blood on the pad but it is mainly clear fluid. Initially the \n\n【14】fluid soaked through all of her clothes, but it is now less. There has been no abdominal pain.\n\n【15】Examination\n\n【16】She appears distressed. Her temperature is 37.1 degrees, blood pressure is 115/68 mmHg and \n\n【17】pulse is 84/min.\n\n【18】Abdominally the uterus is palpable about one-third of the way between pubic symphysis and \n\n【19】umbilicus and feels soft. The abdomen is non-tender.\n\n【20】Speculum examination shows the cervix to appear normal and closed. There is a moderate \n\n【21】amount of clear watery shiny fluid pooling in the speculum, which is also seen coming from \n\n【22】the cervix when the woman is asked to cough.\n\n【23】INVESTIGATIONS\n\n【24】Normal range for \n\n【25】pregnancy\n\n【26】Urinalysis: trace protein; no leucocytes; no nitrites\n\n【27】Haemoglobin 10.8 g/dL 11–14 g/dL\n\n【28】Mean cell volume 92 fL 74.4–95.6 fL\n\n【29】White cell count 6.9×109/L 6–16×109/L\n\n【30】Platelets 321×109/L 150–400×109/L\n\n【31】C-reactive protein 11.3 mg/L <10 mg/L\n\n【32】Questions\n\n【33】• What is the diagnosis?\n\n【34】• What is the prognosis and what should you say to the woman?\n\n【35】• What, if any, further investigations should be requested and what would be your \n\n【36】management plan?100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology\n\n【37】110\n\n【38】ANSWER 44\n\n【39】Diagnosis\n\n【40】The history and speculum findings are very highly suggestive of rupture of membranes \n\n【41】at 17 weeks’ gestation. This is relatively rare but the presence of persistent first-trimester \n\n【42】bleeding is a risk factor, probably because the blood and haemosiderin cause irritation \n\n【43】and ultimately necrotic breakdown of the membranes. The other likely cause is subclinical \n\n【44】infection. Bacterial vaginosis in particular is associated with increased risk of midtrimester \n\n【45】fetal loss.\n\n【46】! Prognosis and communication to the woman\n\n【47】The prognosis in such premature rupture of membranes is extremely poor. This is because \n\n【48】of the various factors that may ensue following membrane rupture:\n\n【49】1. Spontaneous miscarriage is common after rupture of membranes.\n\n【50】2. Chorioamnionitis is likely to develop once the integrity of the gestation sac has \n\n【51】been breached.\n\n【52】3. If miscarriage or infection does not occur, then the fetus is likely to have profound \n\n【53】pulmonary hypoplasia due to lack of amniotic fluid, as well as limb contractures.\n\n【54】Exact figures are not available but an estimate of the possibility of the woman taking \n\n【55】home a live baby is probably around 10–20 per cent. Therefore she must be offered a \n\n【56】grave prognosis for the pregnancy, with respect to not only the chance of fetal survival \n\n【57】but also the chance of her developing chorioamnionitis, which can be very sudden and \n\n【58】catastrophic.\n\n【59】Further investigation and management\n\n【60】To confirm the diagnosis and to check whether the fetal heartbeat is still present an ultra￾sound scan should be performed. If the fetus has died then medical evacuation of the preg￾nancy should be carried out without delay.\n\n【61】If the fetus is alive and the scan confirms anhydramnios or oligohydramnios then the woman \n\n【62】should be given the option of termination of the pregnancy. This would be in her best inter￾ests in terms of preventing serious maternal infection. In view of the poor prognosis for the \n\n【63】fetus, many women would choose this option.\n\n【64】If she declines termination then she should be closely monitored for symptoms and signs \n\n【65】of infection such as fever, shivering, ’flu type symptoms, abdominal pain, offensive vaginal \n\n【66】discharge or bleeding. Pyrexia >37.5°, tachycardia, hypotension or increased respiratory rate \n\n【67】should be looked for. Alternate-day serum C-reactive protein and white cell count should be \n\n【68】checked. There should be a very low threshold for recommending termination of the preg￾nancy if any combination of these features develops, as sepsis is a leading cause of maternal \n\n【69】death in the UK, with one-third of such deaths occurring before 24 weeks’ gestation.\n\n【70】During expectant management the fetal heartbeat should be auscultated daily to allow for \n\n【71】evacuation of the pregnancy if the fetus dies in utero. Whether the pregnancy is terminated \n\n【72】due to fetal death, maternal choice or maternal infection, the first-line method would be the \n\n【73】use of prostaglandin, preceded by mifepristone (a progesterone antagonist) 48 hours earlier \n\n【74】if time allows.Case 44: Midtrimester complications\n\n【75】111\n\n【76】KEY POINTS\n\n【77】• The prognosis for a baby after rupture of membranes in the second trimester is \n\n【78】extremely poor.\n\n【79】• The risks of sepsis and its consequences for the mother should be considered as \n\n【80】very important in counseling the woman regarding continuation of the pregnancy \n\n【81】after second trimester rupture of membranes.\n\n【82】• The woman should be advised to report any symptoms or signs of possible sepsis \n\n【83】and these should be acted on as soon as possible.Case 45: Pain and bleeding in early pregnancy\n\n【84】113\n\n【85】", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Vagal activity also will decrease rather than increase heart rate (answer A) and con-duction velocity through the AV node (answer C) and will have little effect on action potentials in the ventricles (answer D) because there is relatively little parasympathetic innervation of the ventricles.

This patient has fractured his distal humerus, which is a common way to injure the ulnar nerve. Remember, the ulnar nerve courses through the medial epicondyle of the humerus just below the skin, so it is not well-protected at all. This vulnerability is famous with the so-called “funny bone” injuries. Our patient’s radiograph shows a much more serious injury–a completely fractured humerus, so it should come as no surprise that muscles innervated by the ulnar nerve would have decreased function. Of the muscles listed here, only the flexor carpi ulnaris is innervated by the ulnar nerve, and on exam the patient would not be able to flex his fingers.  \n  \nAnswer A is incorrect . The first and second lumbrical muscles are innervated by the radial nerve, which is more classically injured by a mid-humeral frature. The third and fourth lumbricals are innervated by the ulnar nerve, though, so their function would likely be compromised for this patient.  \n  \nAnswer B is incorrect . The brachioradialis is innervated by the radial nerve, which is more classically damaged by a mid-humeral fracture.  \n  \nAnswer D is incorrect . The opponens pollicis muscle is innervated by the recurrent branch of the median nerve, so it would not be affected by an ulnar nerve injury.  \n  \nAnswer E is incorrect . The palmaris longus muscle is innervated by the median nerve, so it would not be affected by an ulnar nerve injury.  \n  \nAnswer F is incorrect .

Ziprasidone (Geodon) (answer E) and risperidone (Risperdal) (answer D) are atypical antipsychotics that would be effective if the patient was having a transient psychotic episode， which he is not having. Divalproex sodium(answer B) is an antiepileptic agent used as a mood stabilizer to treat condi-tions such as mania. Zolpidem (Ambien) (answer A) is useful for insomnia， but the depressive symptoms likely are responsible for the sleep disturbances and therefore need to be treated.\n\n【26】54.4 D.

She is diagnosed with streptococcal Group A pharyngitis and is treated with IM penicillin. Within a few minutes of the injection, the patient is dyspneic, tachycardic, and hypotensive, and is noted to have wheezing on examination. She also complains of dysphagia. IM epinephrine is administered immediately for her anaphylactic reaction.\n\n【2】 What effect will epinephrine have on this patient’s vascular system?\n\n【3】 Which adrenoceptor primarily mediates the vascular response?\n\n【4】 What effect will epinephrine have on her respiratory system?\n\n【5】 Which adrenoceptor primarily mediates the respiratory system response?\n\n【6】ANSWERS TO CASE 1:\n\n【7】Autonomic Sympathetic Nervous System\n\n【8】_Summary_ : A 12-year-old girl with “strep throat” is given an injection of penicillin and develops an acute anaphylactic reaction.\n\n【9】 Effect of epinephrine on vascular system: Vasoconstriction.\n\n【10】 Adrenoceptor which primarily mediates the vascular response: Alpha-1 (α <sub>1 </sub> ).\n\n【11】 Effect of epinephrine on the pulmonary system: Bronchial muscle relaxation.\n\n【12】 Adrenoceptor which primarily mediates the pulmonary response: Beta-2 (β <sub>2 </sub> ).\n\n【13】#### CLINICAL CORRELATION\n\n【14】Anaphylaxis is an acute, immune-mediated response to an allergen characterized by bronchospasm, wheezing, tachycardia, and hypotension. Epinephrine is the drug of choice used to treat this condition because it counteracts the pathophysiologic processes underlying anaphylaxis through the activation of alpha (α)- and beta (β)-adrenoceptors. As with all emergencies, the ABCs (airway, breathing, circulation) should be addressed first. Occasionally, anaphylaxis causes laryngeal edema to the extent that the airway is compromised, and intubation (placement of a tube in the trachea) is impossible. In these circumstances, an emergency airway, such as a surgical cricothyroidotomy (creating an opening from the skin through the cricoid cartilage), is required. The appropriate dose: In children, 0.01 mg per kilogram body weight (1 mg/mL preparation) or a maximum dose of 0.5 mg can be given intramuscularly and can be repeated every 5 to 25 minutes as needed. In adults, 0.3 to 0.5 mg (1 mg/mL preparation).\n\n【15】APPROACH TO:\n\n【16】The Autonomic Sympathetic Nervous System\n\n【17】#### OBJECTIVES\n\n【18】1\\. List the neurotransmitters of the autonomic sympathetic nervous system and describe their anatomical localization.\n\n【19】2\\. List the receptors and receptor subtypes of the autonomic sympathetic nervous system.\n\n【20】3\\. Predict the responses to activation and inhibition of autonomic sympathetic nervous system receptors.\n\n【21】#### DEFINITIONS\n\n【22】Autonomic nervous system: Subdivision of the peripheral nervous system that is largely controlled unconsciously, shown in Figure 1–1 .\n\n【23】Figure 1–1. Schematic of autonomic nervous system.\n\n【24】Sympathetic nervous system: A division of the autonomic nervous system (the other is the parasympathetic nervous system). Preganglionic fibers originate in the CNS and are carried on the thoracic and lumbar spinal nerves to synapse on ganglia close to the spinal cord. Synapses also occur on the adrenal medulla, which is considered a modified ganglion. Postganglionic fibers innervate a wide variety of effector organs and tissues, including arteriole and bronchial smooth muscles.\n\n【25】Agonist: A molecule (drug) that binds to and activates a receptor, resulting in a response.\n\n【26】Antagonist: A molecule (drug) that binds to receptors with little or no effect of its own, but that can block the action of an agonist that binds to the same receptors.\n\n【27】Mydriasis: Dilatation of the eye pupil.\n\n【28】#### DISCUSSION\n\n【29】##### _Class_\n\n【30】Endogenous catecholamines are the typical neurotransmitters released from postganglionic nerve terminals. The neurotransmitter norepinephrine is released from the efferent nerves of the sympathetic autonomic nervous system at postganglionic sympathetic (also known as “adrenergic”) nerve endings. Epinephrine and some norepinephrine are released from the adrenal medulla.\n\n【31】Catecholamine agonists interact at postsynaptic adrenoceptors (named after the adrenergic nerves that innervate them) that are classified as either alpha (α) or beta (β).\n\n【32】There are two subtypes of the α-adrenoceptor, α <sub>1 </sub> and α <sub>2 </sub> . Activation of the α <sub>1 </sub> \\-adrenoceptors by adrenergic agonists results in contraction of most vascular smooth muscle (α <sub>1 </sub> ) causing increased peripheral resistance and blood pressure, contraction of the pupillary dilator muscle resulting in mydriasis, relaxation of gastrointestinal smooth muscle and contraction of gastrointestinal sphincters (α <sub>1 </sub> , indirectly through inhibition of acetylcholine \\[Ach\\] release), and ejaculation. Activation of presynaptic adrenoceptor autoreceptors (α <sub>2 </sub> ) by catecholamines results in (feedback) inhibition of the release of norepinephrine and other neurotransmitters from their respective nerve endings.\n\n【33】There are three subtypes of the β-adrenoceptor, β <sub>1 </sub> , β <sub>2 </sub> , and β <sub>3 </sub> . Activation of β-adrenoceptors by adrenergic agonists results in increased rate and force of contraction of the heart (β <sub>1 </sub> ), smooth muscle relaxation of bronchi causing bronchodilation (β <sub>2 </sub> ) , and activation of fat cell lipolysis (β <sub>3 </sub> ) .\n\n【34】Because the catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine have important physiologic roles, drugs that block their actions, that is, adrenoceptor antagonists, can have important, and clinically useful, pharmacologic effects. α-Adrenoceptor nonselective antagonists (eg, phentolamine) are used to treat the hypertension of pheochromocytoma (a tumor that secretes catecholamines) and male erectile dysfunction, whereas the more selective α-adrenoceptor antagonists (eg, prazosin, terazosin, doxazosin) are used to treat hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia ( Table 1–1 ).\n\n【35】Table 1–1 • SELECTED EFFECTS OF ADRENOCEPTOR ACTIVATION\n\n【36】##### _Structure_\n\n【37】Epinephrine and norepinephrine are catecholamines, synthesized from tyrosine, that possess a catechol nucleus with an ethylamine side chain (epinephrine is the methylated side chain derivative of norepinephrine). The rate-limiting enzyme in this process is tyrosine hydroxylase.\n\n【38】##### _Mechanism of Action_\n\n【39】Epinephrine binding to α <sub>1 </sub> \\-adrenoceptors activates a G-protein (Gq-type GTP-binding protein \\[Gq\\]) to stimulate phospholipase C, resulting in the formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP <sub>3 </sub> ) to promote release of Ca <sup>2+ </sup> from intracellular stores. Epinephrine interaction with α <sub>2 </sub> \\-adrenoceptors activates a Gi-type GTP-binding protein (Gi) to inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity and decreases intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Epinephrine perhaps also increases β <sub>1 </sub> \\-adrenoceptor-mediated influx of Ca <sup>2+ </sup> across membrane channels.\n\n【40】In addition to the increased formation of the second messenger, IP <sub>3 </sub> , epinephrine also increases the phospholipase-mediated formation of another second messenger diacylglycerol (DAG) that activates protein kinase C to influence a number of other signaling pathways. Epinephrine also activates β <sub>1 </sub> and β <sub>2 </sub> \\-adrenoceptors to increase a G-protein-mediated stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity, thereby increasing intracellular cAMP levels and the activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinases.\n\n【41】##### _Administration_\n\n【42】Epinephrine is generally administered parenterally (IM) for treatment of anaphylactic shock.

An anesthesiologist designs a clinical research project to study the efficacy of lumbar sympathetic blockade (LSB) with lidocaine compared to intravenous (IV) lidocaine in pediatric patients with CRPS who have not responded to traditional therapy. The study is a double-blind placebo-controlled study, involving 40 children between the ages of 7 and 12. All will receive general anesthesia and placement of a lumbar sympathetic catheter. Patients will then be randomized to receive either IV lidocaine plus saline via lumbar sympathetic catheter, or LSB with lidocaine plus IV saline. In obtaining informed consent, the researcher explains to parents and children (to the degree that the children can understand) the risks of general anesthesia and lumbar sympathetic catheter placement .\n> \n> In answer to the expressed desires and expectations from patients and parents of pain relief, the researcher informs them that the “real” drug may be effective (in fact, he thinks it will be), but that it is equally important that researchers determine if LSB lidocaine is ineffective in relieving the pain. Several parents express concerns that their children may be subjected to the risks of general anesthesia and of lumbar catheter placement, but not receive the benefit of pain relief. They want assurances that their children will receive lidocaine and not placebo.\n> \n> What are the ethical considerations in human subjects research when the patients who are being studied belong to vulnerable groups, such as children? Should human subjects research be conducted in vulnerable populations?\n\n【4】Vulnerable persons enrolled as research participants require special protection. This is recognized in a number of international and national regulations, including the US federal regulations on research with human subjects (see Table 31.1 ). When designing and conducting a research study, it is important to know which potential participants are vulnerable, which studies do or do not justify their inclusion, and what protections are necessary when they do participate in research.\n\n【5】This does not mean that vulnerable persons should never be enrolled in research. Historically, scandals have involved abusive studies where vulnerable persons were included because they were less able to resist. Excluding vulnerable persons from research entirely, however, can lead to their exclusion from: (1) research with potential benefit; and (2) the more general benefits of the research endeavor: knowledge about conditions relevant to them, their sometimes specific needs and risks, and the possibility to generalize available data to the situations they present with.\n\n【6】##### Who is vulnerable?\n\n【7】Attempts to define vulnerability have differed in their scope. <sup>1 </sup> A European “principle of vulnerability” presents it as a universal expression of the human condition. <sup>2 </sup> Such broad definitions, encompassing humanity in its entirety, <sup>3,4 </sup> are unhelpful in protecting human subjects as they cannot provide reasons for special protection. In a more restricted definition, “vulnerability” in research on human subjects is often applied to individuals who are unable to give informed consent or more likely to be exploited. <sup>5 </sup> National and international regulations are based on this sort of definition: vulnerability is usually linked either to consent or to the risk of harm.\n\n【8】One way to synthesize these different definitions is to consider that vulnerability as a claim to special protection is an identifiably increased likelihood of being wronged . <sup>6 </sup> It encompasses any wrongs, including those we incur when something to which we have a valid claim is denied us. Defining vulnerability in this way means that we start by identifying the sorts of wrongs likely to occur in the conduct of research, then identify those more likely to suffer these wrongs. Many individuals are vulnerable in this way; but this definition makes the identification of different kinds of vulnerability, and the development of targeted protections, easier\n\n【9】Table 31.1. Vulnerability in research according to international guidelines\n\n【10】.\n\n【11】##### Protecting vulnerable persons in research\n\n【12】Necessary protections have two components: fair subject selection, and the specific care required to minimize wrongs to vulnerable persons once they are enrolled in research. Recruitment of research subjects should respect fairness in the distribution of research-related risks and benefits. It is not justifiable to conduct research on an “easily available” population – for example, the rural poor in developing countries – simply because the study will be easier to conduct with them than with persons living in better circumstances. Neither is it defensible to reserve access to potentially beneficial research to the socially privileged. The rationale for the planned recruitment strategy must be based on the balance of potential harms and benefits and the need to obtain generalisable results, and discussed in the protocol.\n\n【13】Specific care requires that the risks and needs of those more likely to suffer wrongs in the conduct of research be identified, and targeted special protections outlined. Protecting vulnerability in clinical research starts with a good grasp of criteria for ethical research, in general. Investigators designing research with vulnerable subjects, and ERCs reviewing such research, should ask themselves the following questions:\n\n【14】(1) In which ways are potential research subjects at risk of being wronged in this research?\n\n【15】(2) Are some potential subjects identifiably more likely than other persons to incur this wrong, or likely to incur it to a greater degree?\n\n【16】(3) Am I/are we among those who share in the duty to minimize, or avoid, this wrong?\n\n【17】(4) If yes, what should we do to avoid this wrong or minimize its increased likelihood or degree, or ensure it is compensated in ethically justifiable ways?\n\n【18】Based on the sorts of wrongs that can occur in clinical research, examples of vulnerability are outlined in Table 31.2 ; examples of protections tailored to the wrongs involved are outlined in the Table 31.3 . In some cases, excluding vulnerable persons from participation in a research project will be an appropriate way to minimize the risk of harm or other wrongs. Sometimes, however, it won’t be. A study designed to address health problems specific to a vulnerable population, such as research on advanced dementia, could benefit the same population of vulnerable persons from which subjects are recruited, and cannot be conducted on nonvulnerable subjects: a condition known as the subsidiarity principle . A study that, although it could be conducted enrolling only nonvulnerable subjects, could be designed in a way to give sufficient extra protection for vulnerable subjects. When such studies offer prospective benefit to research subjects, excluding vulnerable populations rather than providing protections to allow their recruitment can itself be harmful. If a subject in a research protocol with prospective benefit is imprisoned during the study, for example, terminating his participation may not be in his interest. In the rest of this chapter, we focus on two specific populations of individuals often vulnerable in the conduct of research: children and prisoners.\n\n【19】##### Research involving children\n\n【20】###### Why are children vulnerable?\n\n【21】Going from the state of being a child to that of being an adult is a continuous process, during which societies identify varying points as the threshold marking the passage from one state to the other. Children are considered vulnerable because, during much of their development, they are incapable of decision-making regarding medical intervention. Even when they are capable of decision-making for clinical care, consent for research requires something more: research-related risks are born for the benefits of others, a fact potential subjects are at risk of misunderstanding even in the best of cases. Although minors who are mature adolescents can often understand the consequences of their choice regarding medical interventions and then provide informed consent for clinical care, this is not considered sufficient in the case of research. Additionally, we are more reluctant to expose children to research-related harms, in part again because the risks undergone in this context cannot be consented to by the child herself, but also because we recognize a general responsibility of protection towards children beyond that which their parents endorse.\n\n【22】###### What follows from the vulnerability of children for research ethics?\n\n【23】Fair subject selection requires that children be enrolled only when the research question cannot be answered by conducting the study with adults – for example, because the targeted condition is specific to children or because the research question regards the situation of children specifically. When children are recruited in research, protections are required to circumscribe\n\n【24】Table 31.2. Vulnerability as a greater likelihood of being wronged\n\n【25】\\* With permission from Emanuel, E. J., Wendler, D. and Grady, C. (2000). What makes clinical research ethical? JAMA , 283 (20), 2701–11.\n\n【26】acceptable risks and to compensate the lack of consent by the children.\n\n【27】Limiting risks to children has implications for the timing of a protocol. Interventions relevant to both children and adults should undergo at least initial testing on adults in order to minimize unknown risks at the time when children will be recruited to assess questions more specific to them. Other implications regard the design of a protocol. Under US regulations, ERCs may approve research involving children under three sets of circumstances: “minimal risk,” “prospect of direct benefit,” and “minor increase over minimal risk.” A prospect of direct benefit is defined as a research situation where risks are justified by the anticipated benefit to the subjects and where the relation of the anticipated benefit to the risk is at least as favourable as that of alternatives available to potential subjects.\n\n【28】Linking the acceptable risk threshold to the prospect of direct benefit in this manner has come under criticism for conflating risks acceptable in therapy and in research, and allowing healthy children to undergo greater research-related risk than those accepted in the case of sick children. An alternative proposed by Wendler is based on the “net risks test.” <sup>7 </sup> As any assessment of risk in research, it should focus on the research-related risk : risks that potential research subjects would not run outside the protocol. Sick children enrolled in research will often undergo standard therapy as well as experimental interventions, and risks inherent to the standard therapy are not research-related. The assessment should further focus on the net risk : risks that are not balanced by the prospect of direct benefit to the child. Paediatric pharmacokinetic studies, for example, hold no prospect of direct benefit: their entire risk is a net risk. A phase III study of a novel therapy proven effective in adults, however, does hold a prospect of direct benefit for sick children. Such a study can still have a net risk, however, especially if the expected\n\n【29】Table 31.3. Protection of vulnerable subjects by Ethics Review Committees\\*\n\n【30】\\* With permission from Hurst 2008 .\n\n【31】benefit is modest. Finally, ERCs should assess this net research-related risk and accept it if it is no greater than “those associated with routine medical and psychological examination” <sup>8 </sup> or “those ordinarily encountered in daily life.” <sup>9 </sup> US regulations combine these two thresholds. Comparison of the net research-related risks posed by a study should be with “the level of risk average children face in daily life (or during routine examinations),” <sup>10 </sup> or the level “normally encountered in the daily lives of people in a stable society” <sup>11,12 </sup> in order to avoid placing an excessive burden on children suffering from diseases requiring invasive treatment or living in circumstances such as war-torn countries, whose risks in daily life far exceed what is acceptable in research.\n\n【32】Because children are unable to provide consent for their own participation in research, permission must be sought from their parents or other legal guardians. US regulations specify that the permission of both parents is required unless: (1) the investigational procedure involves no more than minimal risk; (2) there is a prospect of direct benefit to the child; or (3) “one parent is deceased, unknown, incompetent, or not reasonably available” or “only one parent has legal responsibility for the care and custody of the child.” EU directive 2001/20/EC specifies that research can only be conducted on minors if “the informed consent of the parents or legal representative has been obtained,” <sup>13 </sup> apparently requiring the agreement of both parents.\n\n【33】Regulations also require that older children and adolescents should be informed to the level they can understand, and that they should provide assent – defined as “affirmative agreement” in US regulations and provided in writing – when they are capable of doing so. <sup>14 </sup> Determining when assent should be sought is delicate as children’s ability to understand research participation varies across, but also within, age groups. While it is usually found that children under 7 years of age are not capable of giving assent, and those over 14 years often are, this requires specific assessment, especially in the intermediate age group. Letting families decide when children are old enough to be involved in a decision to enroll in research is one possibility, but it should be applied with caution; data suggest that considerable disagreements can arise within families on this point, including reluctance on the part of the parents of capable children to involve them. <sup>15 </sup> Children sometimes wish their parents to decide for them, and this, of course, should be respected.\n\n【34】Protections provided by parental permission and children’s assent are further complemented by requirements that explicit refusal by children be respected. <sup>8 </sup> EU directive 2001/20/EC further specifies that “parental consent must represent the minor’s presumed will,” <sup>13 </sup> and that no financial incentive may be offered. Children who are unable to assent to research may become able to do so, especially in long-term studies. In such cases, their assent (or consent as the case may be), must be sought at that time.\n\n【35】With such protections in place, a (small) net risk in research involving children is acceptable. Allowing such studies is not only necessary to allow the conduct of research needed by children themselves, it is also compatible with motivations of altruism for research participation, a reason accepted by many parents as well as children.\n\n【36】", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Limberg of (then) Leningrad, who first described this technique and spent a lifetime refining it \\[ 1 \\]. However, it was in Modern Trends in Plastic Surgery that the English-speaking medical community really became aware of this surgical innovation \\[ 2 \\]. In this book, Limberg detailed his rhomboid flap – essentially the shape is a parallelogram with two angles of 120° and two of 60° (Fig. 6.1 ). These angles, of course, can be modified depending on the shape of the lesion or defect. All sides of a surgical rhomboid and all sides of the flap are equal. As many as four flaps can be raised from one rhomboid, when planned in the classical form \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【16】Figure 6.1\n\n【17】Rhomboid flap\n\n【18】Limberg and his followers (including us) use a bit of ‘surgical license’ when referring to the ‘rhomboid’ shape. Because, mathematically speaking, a parallelogram with sides of equal length (equilateral) is a rhombus but not a rhomboid (the latter does not have equal sides).\n\n【19】A rhombus has equal sides and 60° and 120° angles. In general, any quadrilateral whose two diagonals are perpendicular is called a kite. Every rhombus is a kite, and any quadrilateral that is both a kite and parallelogram is mathematically a rhombus. Therefore surgically speaking, we are using the term ‘rhomboid’ to mean ‘rhombus.’ As Euclid, the Greek mathematician clarified \\[ 4 \\]:\n\n【20】> Of quadrilateral figures, a square is that which is both equilateral and right-angled; an oblong that which is right-angled but not equilateral; a rhombus that which is equilateral but not right-angled; and a rhomboid that which has its opposite sides and angles equal to one another but is neither equilateral nor right-angled. And let quadrilaterals other than these be called trapezia.\n\n【21】The rhomboid flap is a reliable, versatile, and widely used tool in head and neck surgery \\[ 5 \\]. Although its geometry is well described, the mechanics of the flap when planned in the classical fashion do not always take into account the RSTL or skin creases. In this case study, I discuss the modified rhomboid flap and its applications for head and neck surgery after skin cancer. More specifically, the unique design of the modified rhomboid flap makes an especially good choice for surgery to the ala nasi and the anatomy and planning are detailed in this regard.\n\n【22】The Modified Rhomboid Flap\n--------------------------\n\n【23】In the classical design of a Limberg flap, a rhombus-shaped segment of skin containing the lesion is excised. A flap is created by incising the skin at a 180° angle relative to the short diagonal of the rhombus and then extending this excision parallel to one of the adjacent sides of the rhombus. This area is then undermined and the flap thus created is rotated into the surgical defect (Fig. 6.2 ) \\[ 6 \\]. One of the interesting things we note in the rhomboid flap is that the flap itself closes only a portion of the defect while the 60° angle closest to the point about which the flap is rotated is closed directly. In other words, one is still closing a 60° ‘ellipse’ under tension \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【24】Figure 6.2\n\n【25】Rhomboid flap mechanism illustrated\n\n【26】There are two fundamental problems with the traditional rhomboid flap. The cutting out of a rhomboid shape does not take into account skin tension lines. Secondly, the closure line of the flap is also not orientated along the RSTL which is one of the guiding principles of cutaneous plastic surgery. Larrabee, who has made a remarkable contribution to the modern understanding of the dynamics of several different random flaps spent time analyzing rhomboid flaps. He concluded that the actual position of the final scars is more variable than the changes in length of the flap and is related to local tissue characteristics, e.g. the ease of tissue advancement from different directions. The most important result from his study was a clarification of the distribution of tension in a 60° rhomboid flap. Most of the tension is located at the closure of the donor site .\n\n【27】In other words, an ideally designed rhomboid flap would have the RSTL bisecting the 60° angle of the flap. This is the basis of the modified rhomboid flap.\n\n【28】In the modified rhomboid flap, the lesion is cut out without attempting to create a rhomboid shape (therefore no unnecessary tissue is excised). The 60° flap is planned with the 60° flap angle being bisected by RSTL. Care is taken to ensure that the limbs of the flap are equilateral. Figure 6.3 illustrates a modified rhomboid flap on the cheek (unlike in Fig. 6.2 the shape is not made into a rhomboid; rather the defect is simply cut out – in this case a circular lesion – the black line in the image indicates the RSTL in that location which bisects the 60° flap). And Fig. 6.3 illustrates the difference between a traditional rhomboid flap and the modified version – in the latter, the RSTL or skin creases bisect the 60° flap. However, in the modified rhomboid flap, there is no need to cut additional tissue for the sake of creating a rhomboid shape.\n\n【29】Figure 6.3\n\n【30】( a – b ) Modified rhomboid flap is bisected by the RSTL\n\n【31】Case Studies\n\n【32】Case 1: A biopsy-proven basal-cell carcinoma was excised from the R ala nasi of a 71-year-old woman and the defect was closed with a modified rhomboid flap. I simply cut out the lesion with adequate margins, then plan the modified rhomboid flap using the three essential principles in my method: flap angle bisected by the nasolabial crease; flap lengths equal; flap lengths somewhere between radius and diameter (Fig. 6.4 ). The end result is shown with the flap sutured in place (Fig. 6.5 ). The unique shape of the ala nasi and the adjacent naso-labial crease ensures that there is no scar visible post-op as all the sutures are in skin creases or the margin of the ala nasi.\n\n【33】Figure 6.4\n\n【34】Modified rhomboid flap of the ala nasi plan\n\n【35】Figure 6.5\n\n【36】Modified rhomboid flap of the ala nasi sutured in place\n\n【37】Case 2: A nodular BCC involved more than half the ala nasi on the L side of the nose on a 60-year old woman. After the lesion was excised and tumor clearance ensured, the modified rhomboid flap was planned. The image (Fig. 6.6 .) shows the design clearly with the nasolabial crease bisecting the flap. Figure 6.7 shows the flap sutured in place with no distortion of the ala nasi and suture line well hidden in crease lines. You will note that in both examples discussed in this paper, I have based the flap caudally rather than cranially. This is because if a rhomboid flap is planned from the superior aspect i.e. cranially, then it tends to ‘bridge’ over the ala nasi as some nasolabial flaps tend to do (and often need revision). In Fig. 6.7 . the slight notch on the L ala nasi was the pre-existing ‘normal’ shape of the patient’s L ala nasi. There was no discrepancy between the sides at the end of the procedure. The nasolabial crease provides a perfect site for the modified rhomboid flap as it lies alongside a rounded structure (the ala). This flap is also useful in other sites like the ear lobe or indeed anywhere where a conventional rhomboid flap is planned. It has the advantages of a more ‘anatomical’ closure utilizing the RSTL.\n\n【38】Figure 6.6\n\n【39】Modified rhomboid flap of L ala nasi plan\n\n【40】Figure 6.7\n\n【41】Modified rhomboid flap of L ala nasi sutured in place\n\n【42】Discussion\n----------\n\n【43】Many surgeons like Lister and Gibson spent considerable time in analyzing the closure of wound defects using rhomboid flaps and several variants of the original design \\[ 8 \\]. One important point with either the classical Limberg design or the modified version I have presented here is this – at any angle other than 60° we will theoretically have either compression or stretching of the flap itself \\[ 9 \\]. Therefore 60° is the optimal angle for the flap.\n\n【44】It is worth looking at other variants of rhomboid flaps.\n\n【45】Dufourmentel modified the rhomboid flap and published his paper in 1962 \\[ 10 \\]. As in a classical Limberg flap, the defect is created in the shape of a rhomboid. The excision is then extended at an acute angle of up to 60° relative to the original incision (see 1. In Fig. 6.8 ) – therefore this flap creates unequal tension on the lateral borders of the defect and is useful in repairing rhomboid defects where the acute angle of the defect is between 60° and 90°. Dufourmentel felt that this flap was ideally suited to close ‘lozenge-shaped’ defects. Some authors feel that even if the rhomboid flap is a pivotal flap, Dufourmentel’s design actually ends up making this a ‘straight advancement of tissue’ \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【46】Figure 6.8\n\n【47】Limberg ( 1 ), Duformental ( 2 ) and Webster ( 3 ) Flaps\n\n【48】In 1978, Webster et al. \\[ 11 \\] described the combined use of a 30° transposition flap and an M-plasty to repair rhomboidal defect – however his technique was also plagued by unequal tensions on the lateral borders of the defect.\n\n【49】However, while it is easy to be geometrically accurate while planning the flap, the variability of tissue dynamics between individuals makes it difficult to accurately predict tension. When measurements were done in piglet skin by Larrabee, he noted as much as 29 % discrepancy from predicted values \\[ 5 \\]. As Lister and Gibson noted as early as in 1972, predicting the flap movement needs a ‘computer rather than a plastic surgeon’ \\[ 12 \\]. Therefore as I discussed earlier, 60° seems to cause the least distortion (and least disagreement) when it comes to rhomboid flaps.\n\n【50】The closest to the technique I am describing here was a paper titled ‘A square peg into a round hole’ flap which was published in 1987 \\[ 13 \\]. The authors, Quaba and Sommerlad mention the modifications they made to traditional rhomboid flaps thus \\[ 13 \\]:\n\n【51】1.\n\n【52】The lesion is excised as necessary without considering the shape of the defect produced; corners need not be sacrificed to produce a rhomboid-shaped defect. Many defects will end up having an almost circular shape.\n\n【53】2.\n\n【54】The flap is always planned to be smaller than the defect. The chosen diagonal is therefore, extended by about two-thirds of its own length. In other words, they suggest that the flap length be 2/3 the diameter of the defect. I have found that the flaps works as long as the flap length is somewhere between radius and diameter and precise measurement is not necessary.\n\n【55】3.\n\n【56】Although it may look rather like putting a “square peg into a round hole,” surprisingly, it is rarely necessary to trim the corners of the flap.\n\n【57】4.\n\n【58】One of the problems with transposition flaps of this nature is the risk of pin-cushioning, which is also sometimes referred to (as Quaba and Sommerlad do) as trap-door formation, although there is an important distinction, in my view – trap-door deformities result while using a island flap, as the tension across the flap suture line tends to aggravate the tension. In contrast, when using a transposition such as a bilobed flap or rhomboid flaps, the tension across the line of closure may result in pin-cushioning of the flap.\n\n【59】Quaba and Sommerlad, in their excellent paper suggest that this ‘trap-dooring’ was observed in approximately 9 % of patients, especially where small defects were closed with apparently over-generous flaps. Therefore keeping the flap small often works better. As I have illustrated in Fig. 6.3 , the modified rhomboid flap often looks rather small for the defect, but with planning as detailed in this paper it is a very versatile flap.\n\n【60】In conclusion, the modified rhomboid flap is a major improvement on traditional rhomboid flap designs. While these flaps can be used anywhere a traditional rhomboid would have been contemplated, it is especially suited to defects of the ala nasi region as the anatomy of the site allows for perfect alignment of this flap.\n", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Over the years she has tried many medications but with little relief of her symptoms, and instead has experienced severe adverse effects. She is referred for possible ablation surgery.

The neurosurgeon explains that by nullifying or accentuating some of the pathways, some of her symptoms may be alleviated. The introduction of an ablative lesion into which structure labeled in the image would be expected to improve this patient’s bradykinesia?\n\n【1】> Reproduced, with permission, from USMLERx.com.\n\n【2】> (A) A\n\n【3】> (B) B\n\n【4】> (C) C\n\n【5】> (D) D\n\n【6】> (E) E\n\n【7】 **Answer**: The correct answer is A . The patient in this question suffers from refractory Parkinson disease (PD). In this disease the internal segment of the globus pallidus produces excessive inhibition of the ventral lateral nucleus of the thalamus, making it difficult for patients to initiate movements (bradykinesia). Normally, dopaminergic neurons from the substantia nigra induce striatal neurons to inhibit the globus pallidus, thereby lifting the inhibition of the thalamus. Because of decreased dopaminergic signaling from the substantia nigra in PD, this pathway is ineffective. Ablating part of the internal segment of the globus pallidus (pallidotomy) would reduce its tonic inhibition of the thalamus and improve the patient’s parkinsonian symptoms. Note that first-line treatment for PD is pharmacologic, most classically with levodopa, which is converted into dopamine in the brain.  \n  \nAnswer B is incorrect . The putamen is one of the components of the striatum. It contains neurons with dopamine receptors that are responsive to projections from dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra. Some of the striatal neurons provide inhibitory input to the internal segment of the globus pallidus, which is necessary for the initiation of movement. Ablating the putamen may therefore make the patient’s bradykinesia worse.  \n  \nAnswer C is incorrect . The internal capsule is a white-matter tract that transmits the axons of upper motor neurons to the brainstem and spinal cord. Ablating the internal capsule would cause devastating hemiplegia with upper motor neuron symptoms (eg, spasticity, hyperreflexia).  \n  \nAnswer D is incorrect . The caudate nucleus is one of the components of the striatum. It contains neurons with dopamine receptors that are responsive to projections from dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra. Some of the striatal neurons provide inhibitory input to the internal segment of the globus pallidus, which is necessary for the initiation of movement. Ablating the caudate nucleus might therefore make the patient’s bradykinesia even worse.  \n  \nAnswer E is incorrect . The corpus callosum is a white-matter tract that transmits axons from one side of the cerebral cortex to the other, allowing the two halves of the brain to communicate. Ablating the corpus callosum could cause perceptual abnormalities but would not improve the patient’s parkinsonian symptoms.\n", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

You probably have heard about collagen in the context of tendons and skin. Collagen forms a stiff fiber that is made up of three long polypeptide chains that assemble into a twisted helix, stabilized in part by hydrogen bond formation between the side chains (R groups) of proline. The enzyme prolyl hydroxylase reacts with the proline in collagen to help to promote proper folding of the triple helix inside the RER. Activity of prolyl hydroxylase requires ascorbic acid , better known as vitamin C, as a cofactor.\n\n【4】Collagen is synthesized and secreted from fibroblast and osteoblast cells. Because collagen is destined to exit the cell, translation of preprocollagen polypeptide mRNAs is targeted at the RER. After entering the RER the signal sequence is removed and initial folding of individual polypeptide strands occur. Proper alignment of the three polypeptides is made possible by the presence of globular propeptides located at the amino and carboxyl-terminal ends of each polypeptide. The final product is a 300 nm long microfibril of procollagen ( PC ). Procollagen is then transported from the RER to the Golgi complex and eventually out of the cell. Misfolded microfibrils are unable to travel to the Golgi and will accumulate inside the RER. Only after PC has left the cell do PC peptidases cleave off the globular propeptides, allowing the microfibrils to assemble into fibrils that finally assemble into collagen fibers forming an important part of the extracellular matrix.\n\n【5】▪ What is the difference between a “polypeptide” and a “protein?”\n\n【6】▪ Conduct a search for images or diagrams of the molecular structure of collagen microfibrils and fibers.

Proteins, like PC, that must be exported out of the cell are synthesized on the RER, travel through the individual cisternae or stacks of the Golgi complex, and finally exit the cell at the plasma membrane. Two models have been proposed to explain the transport of proteins through the Golgi complex. The vesicular transport model proposes that Golgi cisternae are stable membrane compartments. Each cisterna contains a characteristic set of enzymes that function to modify proteins as they pass through the compartment. Based on this model, proteins are carried forward from one compartment to the next in small, membrane-bound transport vesicles. In contrast, the cisternal maturation model states that Golgi cisternae are dynamic organelles that are constantly being formed from the RER and that change their function or “mature” with time. Proteins remain within a Golgi cisterna and are modified as a result of changes in the population of enzymes. According to this model a cis Golgi compartment “matures” into a medial Golgi cisterna and a medial Golgi compartment “matures” into a trans Golgi cisterna due to the backward transport of enzymes between the cisternae.\n\n【14】Cisternal maturation helps to explain how very large protein aggregates can move through the Golgi complex. Proteins like PC are too large (300 nm) to fit into a transport vesicle (50–90 nm) and yet these proteins are glycosylated just like the smaller, soluble proteins that are known to travel in transport vesicles. The cisternal maturation model predicts that protein aggregates would remain in the lumen of a single Golgi cisterna as that membrane compartment matures from cis to trans . The synthesis and transport of PC by chick embryonic fibroblast cells was examined in this case study with the goal of testing the validity of the cisternal maturation model.\n\n【15】▪ List the organelles that are a part of the endomembrane system.\n\n【16】▪ Create a diagram that illustrates the two models of protein transport through the Golgi complex.\n\n【17】▪ Research/review the nature of transport vesicles in the endomembrane system. How do COPI vesicles differ from COPII vesicles?\n\n【18】▪ Describe the relationship between a protein’s amino acid sequence and its function.\n\n【19】Methods\n-------\n\n【20】### Primary culture of chick embryo fibroblast cells\n\n【21】Primary cultures of fibroblast cells were isolated from a 15-day-old chicken embryo tendons (ET) by incubation in the presence of 3 mg/mL collagenase in tissue culture media. Cells were harvested from the media by filtering through cheesecloth followed by centrifugation. The fibroblast cell pellet was resuspended in tissue culture media and plated into glass chamber slides coated with 30 μg/mL fibronectin. Cells were incubated for 18 h at 37°C before use in any experiments.\n\n【22】### Immunofluorescence\n\n【23】Cultured ET fibroblast cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. The cells were rinsed with buffer and incubated with antibodies that recognize the carboxy-terminal domain of PC (LF68 antibody) and the Golgi-specific integral membrane protein giantin . The cells were then incubated with fluorescent-labeled secondary antibodies.\n\n【24】### Immunoelectron microscopy\n\n【25】ET fibroblast cells were fixed and permeabilized as described previously. The cells were incubated with a monoclonal antibody specific to the folded form of PC (hCL(1)) followed by incubation with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody. In the presence of 0.001% hydrogen peroxide (H <sub>2 </sub> O <sub>2 </sub> ), the HRP enzyme catalyze a reaction with 0.075% 3,3’-diaminobenzidine tetrachloride (DAB-HCl) to form an insoluble precipitate that appears as a dark electron-dense region in the electron micrograph.\n\n【26】### PC “wave” protocols\n\n【27】Movement of PC from the RER through the Golgi was synchronized using two different protocols. Both protocols relied on the ability of the iron-chelating compound 2,2’-dipyridyl (DPD) to inhibit the proper folding of PC resulting in the retention of unfolded PC in the RER. The “exiting wave” protocol followed the movement of the population of PC proteins already present in the Golgi. ET fibroblast cells were treated with 0.3 mM DPD for 0–60 min, fixed, and reacted with a monoclonal antibody to folded PC. Since DPD inhibits the folding of PC, the only proteins that the antibody can react with are proteins that had already left the RER. The “incoming wave” protocol also used 0.3 mM DPD to block the exit of PC from the RER; however, in this protocol the cells were incubated in the DPD until the PC proteins already present in the lumen of the Golgi had exited the cell. Washing out the DPD and supplementing the media with ascorbic acid (vitamin C) allowed PC to fold properly and exit the RER as a single wave of protein. Localization of the folded PC was achieved using the same fold-specific antibody. Cis to trans polarity of the Golgi in both protocols relied on the presence of clathrin-coated vesicles as markers for the trans Golgi compartment.\n\n【28】### Assay of PC release\n\n【29】Cells were grown as described previously and treated with DPD following either the “exiting wave” or “incoming wave” protocols. Tissue culture media was collected at time points after the addition (exiting wave) or removal (incoming wave) of 0.3 mM DPD. Fresh media were added to the cells following each collection. Proteins present in the media were precipitated using 10% trichloroacetic (TCA) acid and were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using a polyclonal antibody to PC (Sp1.D8). The intensity of the stained bands was quantitated using image analysis software.\n\n【30】▪ Use your own words to define the terms primary culture and immortalized cell line .\n\n【31】▪ What effect did incubation with collagenase have on the tissue?

What can you conclude from this observation?\n\n【49】▪ Predict whether the time required for PC aggregates to move through the Golgi complex, the transit time , will be different in cells under the “exiting wave” protocol versus cells under the “incoming wave” protocol.\n\n【50】▪ Use the graph in Figure 8.3.2 a to determine the time it takes for the number of PC aggregates to decrease by half in the cis and trans Golgi cisternae. Estimate the transit time across the Golgi complex as the difference between these two values.\n\n【51】▪ Use the graph in Figure 8.3.2 b to determine the time it takes for the number of PC aggregates to increase by half in the cis and trans Golgi cisternae. Calculate the transit time based on the “incoming wave” protocol.\n\n【52】▪ Discuss how transit time data relate to your prediction for the two treatment protocols.\n\n【53】▪ Summarize the results shown in Figure 8.3.2 c and d. Include the bottom panel in your summary.\n\n【54】▪ Formulate a hypothesis for why the number of PC aggregates and the amount of released PC in Figure 8.3.2 b and d are greater than in Figure 8.3.2 a and c.\n\n【55】▪ Explain the relationship between the data in Figure 8.3.2 a and b and the data in Figure 8.3.2 c and d.\n\n【56】▪ The researchers conclude that the behavior of PC aggregates in ET fibroblast cells is consistent with the cisternal maturation model of Golgi transport. Design an experiment using PC expression in ET fibroblast cells that would further test the cisternal maturation model.\n\n【57】Figure 8.3.1 PC aggregates stay within the lumen of the cisternae as they are transported through the Golgi.  \nImmunofluorescence images of chick embryo fibroblasts stained for PC (a–c) and the Golgi marker protein giantin (d–f). PC colocalizes with the RER and Golgi in control cells (a and d). Incubation in the presence of DPD results in the loss of PC staining of the Golgi (b and e). However, colocalization is recovered after removal of DPD (c and f). Immunoelectron microscopy of fibroblast cells treated with DPD using the “exiting wave” protocol. Visualization of the relative location of PC aggregates in the Golgi complex before (A), or after 10 min (B), 30 min (C), or 60 min (D) treatment with DPD. The cis to trans orientation of the Golgi complex was determined based on the presence of clathrin-coated vesicles (see arrows and inset images). E. The RER appears distended following the 60 min treatment with DPD. Visualization of PC aggregates following the “incoming wave protocol.” Fibroblasts were pretreated for 60 min with DPD, washed to remove the DPD, and fixed at 10 (F), 20, and 40 min posttreatment. Scale bars a–f = 3.5 μm. Scale bars A–H = 200 nm.\n\n【58】Figure 8.3.2 Endomembrane transport results in PC release into the extracellular space.  \nThe number and location of PC aggregates were tracked using either the “exiting wave” protocol (a) or the “incoming wave” protocol (b). Numbers of aggregates in either the cis (open circles) or trans (filled circles) compartments of the Golgi were counted at the indicated times relative to the addition (a) or removal (b) of 0.3 mM DPD. More than 60 distensions were analyzed per time point in three different experiments. Standard error of the mean (SEM) never exceeded 10%. The amount of PC released from fibroblast cells into the tissue culture media was assayed for both the “exiting wave” protocol (c) and the “incoming wave” protocol (d). Extracellular media were removed at the indicated times and fresh media were added to the cells following the addition (c) or removal (d) of DPD. The amount of PC protein present in the media was determined using SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (bottom panel).\n\n【59】", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

One hundred patients are enrolled and randomized in the study. The study runs for 12 months, during which 30 participants drop out of the treatment group and 10 participants drop out of the control group. At the conclusion of the study, researchers decide to only analyze data from those who remained in the study. The results show that the experimental drug is better than the standard medication at treating psoriasis. The results of this study may be invalid because of what major issue?\n\n【1】> (A) Procedural bias\n\n【2】> (B) Recall bias\n\n【3】> (C) Sampling bias\n\n【4】> (D) Selection bias\n\n【5】> (E) Small number of patients in the study\n\n【6】 **Answer**: The correct answer is D. Selection bias can occur when the researcher decides to not use data obtained from patients who have dropped out of the study, especially if there is a difference in outcome between the group that dropped out and the group that continued treatment. It can also occur with nonrandom assignment of participants to study groups, such as when the subject chooses whether to enter a drug group or a placebo group rather than being randomly assigned, or when the investigator purposely chooses to put a subject in a drug or placebo group. In this experiment, for example, one possible result of selection bias is that people reacting poorly to the experimental drug may choose to drop out. Thus, when we account for these patients, we may see that the experimental drug actually has worse effects on psoriasis, causing patients to drop out of the study. Researchers need to account for dropout data in order to detect the actual difference between the two treatments.  \n  \nAnswer A is incorrect. Procedural bias is the same as recall bias.  \n  \nAnswer B is incorrect. In recall bias, knowledge of the presence of disorders alters the way subjects remember their histories. It is most common in retrospective studies when patients are asked to recall information. For example, those who develop a cold are more likely to identify their exposure than those who do not. They may recall being sneezed on, for example, while those who do not develop a cold do not.  \n  \nAnswer C is incorrect. Sampling bias describes when volunteer subjects in a study are not representative of the population being studied, and as a consequence, the results of the study may not be applicable to the entire population. This is also referred to as external validity.  \n  \nAnswer E is incorrect. Although larger sample sizes increase the power of a study, a study can be valid even with a relatively small number of subjects depending on the magnitude of differences in outcomes between the two groups and the variance of outcome measures among individuals within groups.\n", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Her older brother had tested positive for influenza A several days earlier with similar symptoms. She was initially admitted to the regular nursing floor for management. Shortly after arrival, her work of breathing worsened and she required transfer to the PICU for escalation of monitoring and management. She required intubation for respiratory failure, with subsequent placement of a femoral central venous catheter and radial arterial line. Since PICU admission she has slowly defervesced, with hemodynamic stability and improved ventilation and oxygenation on weaning ventilator settings. Over the past 6 hours, however, she has developed fever to 39.5°C (103.1°F) with hypotension requiring fluid resuscitation and initiation of inotropic support.Past Medical History\n--------------------\n\n【5】The child was born at 28 weeks’ gestation to a gravida 3 para 2 mother with incompetent cervix. Maternal screening for transmittable infections was unrevealing. She was initially admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), requiring intubation for 2 days, but was in room air prior to discharge at age 10 weeks of life. She is fed a fortified infant formula by mouth and prior to this admission had been gaining weight appropriately since NICU discharge. A small patent ductus arteriosus was noted shortly after delivery, for which no intervention has been required. She is followed by ophthalmology for retinopathy of prematurity.

Based on these data, what differential diagnoses would you consider as the cause of the new fever?\n2.  What additional studies would you order?\n3.  What empiric management would you begin and why?Rationale and Evidence‐based Practice Explanation\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】### Based on these data, what differential diagnoses would you consider as the cause of the new fever?\n\n【17】In this case, the combination of leukocytosis and hemodynamic instability requiring volume resuscitation and inotropic support would suggest an infectious process. Leading considerations include the following:\n\n【18】Central line‐associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) is high on the differential diagnosis as she has an existing central line and hemodynamic instability. This is the most likely cause, but other sources of severe infection should also be considered.\n\n【19】Pneumonia should be considered due to previous respiratory illness with ongoing intubation. It is less likely in the setting of normal respiratory examination, normal chest radiograph, and unchanged ventilator requirements. Tracheitis should also be considered due to previous viral illness and prolonged intubation, though is unlikely in the setting of unchanged respiratory secretions. Because of her young age, meningitis should also be considered; however, this infant is not displaying any meningitic signs of changes in mental status, so this would be low on the differential diagnosis. Another consideration for the differential diagnosis includes urinary tract infection (UTI), which is the second most common infection in the intensive care unit. However, most UTIs are associated with indwelling urinary catheters, not present in this infant. Finally, a new respiratory virus should also be considered on the differential diagnosis. While this is possible, it is less likely due to the unchanged respiratory examination and the prominent hemodynamic instability.\n\n【20】### What additional studies would you order?\n\n【21】Blood cultures should be obtained in a patient with new fever when the history and clinical evaluation do not indicate a non‐infectious cause. Guidelines recommend that in patients with indwelling vascular catheters, at least two blood cultures should be obtained, one from peripheral venipuncture and one from the intravascular catheter with suspected infection. Obtaining acute‐phase reactants, such as procalcitonin, may help to evaluate the risk of bacterial infection as the cause of fever. Procalcitonin is specific to bacterial infections. Viral infection, surgery, and chronic inflammation are not associated with increased procalcitonin levels. A procalcitonin level of less than 0.5 ng/mL indicates that bacterial infection is not present; levels of 0.6–2 ng/mL are consistent with systemic inflammatory response syndrome; levels of 2–10 ng/mL are indicative of severe sepsis; and levels above 10 ng/mL indicate septic shock. Additionally, to exclude other foci of infection, respiratory and urinary cultures are valuable to evaluate for ventilator‐associated pneumonia, tracheitis, and UTI.\n\n【22】### What empiric management would you begin and why?\n\n【23】Antibiotic coverage should begin after cultures are obtained. However, inability to obtain cultures (such as a lumbar puncture) should not delay initiation of antibiotic administration. In this case, the primary concern is the development of CLABSI due to the severity of the clinical picture and shock‐like state. Empiric antibiotic therapy should be selected to cover the most common CLABSI organisms, with consideration to common facility‐specific nosocomial pathogens as well as institutional protocols. The most common CLABSI pathogens are staphylococcal species (including _Staphylococcus aureus_ and the coagulase‐negative staphylococci) and enteric Gram‐negative bacilli (such as _Escherichia coli_ and _Klebsiella_ spp.). In settings with significant rates of methicillin‐resistant _S. aureus_ (MRSA), as well as in patients with high suspicion for infection (such as known colonization), vancomycin should be included in the initial therapy. When determining coverage for Gram‐negative bacilli, both local susceptibility data and the severity of infection should be considered. Coverage typically should include a fourth‐generation cephalosporin such as carbapenem, or a β‐lactam/β‐lactamase inhibitor combination, with or without the addition of an aminoglycoside. Patients in whom _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ is a concern (i.e. those with immunocompromise, severe sepsis, or known colonization) should receive an antibiotic regimen with appropriate coverage. Concern for CLABSI in patients with femoral vascular access lines should include coverage for Gram‐negative bacilli, with consideration given to _Candida_ spp.\n\n【24】Continuation of case : The patient is empirically started on vancomycin and cefotaxime after obtaining peripheral and central blood cultures, urine culture, and respiratory cultures. Lumbar puncture is deferred due to hemodynamic instability. Procalcitonin resulted at 4.5 ng/mL. Twelve hours later, preliminary results from both blood cultures are positive for Gram‐positive cocci in clusters. Perfusion remains decreased, and she continues to receive epinephrine drip at 0.1 μg/kg per min without further advancement.Additional Questions and Evidence‐based Rationale\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【25】1.  Based on the blood culture results, what pathogens are most likely?\n2.  What additional management changes would you prioritize?\n\n【26】### Based on the blood culture results, what pathogens are most likely?\n\n【27】Staphylococcal species, specifically _S. aureus_ due to the severity of the disease. Consider the likelihood for MRSA based on facility and patient risks.\n\n【28】### What additional management changes would you prioritize?\n\n【29】Removal of central lines in cases of severe CLABSI is a priority in management.

The patient is 5 ft 2 in， weighs 90 kg， and is otherwise healthy. Fetal heart tones show poor variability and a rate of90 bpm. The patient has had an uneventful general anesthetic previ-ously for an appendectomy.\n\n【2】Considering the emergent nature of the surgery， a general anesthetic is performed with a rapid-sequence induction utilizing propofol and suc-cinylcholine. After a successful endotracheal intubation， 2% sevoflo-rane in 100% oxygen is started. Approximately 4 minutes after induction， a 7 lb 8 oz female infant is born with Apgar scores of 4and 9. The baby does well and the rest of the anesthetic is uneventful.\n\n【3】During the postoperative anesthesia visit on the day following sur-gery， the patient reports to you that she recalls events that occurred dur-ing her procedure and felt that she was in pain but was unable to move.\n\n【4】What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【5】What are the next steps in caring for this patient?\n\n【6】**ANSWERS TO CASE 47：**\n\n【7】Summary： A 28-year-old female patient reports recall after general anesthesia for an emergency caesarean section.\n\n【8】\\> Most likely diagnosis： Awareness or recall during anesthesia， which can be of two types\n\n【9】\\> A. Explicit recall which is conscious recall of events occurring during surgery and may or may not be associated with a sensation of pain and the inability to move.\n\n【10】B. Implicit recall which is nonspecific recognition of events occurring during surgery or a vague awareness of events occurring during surgery.\n\n【11】\\> Next steps： This patient requires a thorough evaluation of the extent of her recall and may need additional consultative services such as psychiatry or counseling to deal with the emotional consequences of recall during surgery.\n\n【12】**ANALYSIS**\n\n【13】**Objectives**\n\n【14】1\\. Review the incidence and factors associated with intraoperative awareness.\n\n【15】2\\. Describe why certain procedures may be associated with an increased inci-dence of intraoperative awareness.\n\n【16】3\\. Understand the steps in evaluating the patient who reports intraoperative awareness.\n\n【17】**Considerations**\n\n【18】This particular patient has undergone an anesthetic and surgery that is asso-ciated with a higher than normal incidence of intraoperative awareness. Emergent caesarean section for fetal distress， particularly in a parturient who is hypotensive and bleeding， is one of the most complicated and difficult anes-thetics to perform. The need for urgent delivery of the hypoxic fetus and to anesthetize a mother who is hypotensive demands that doses of anesthetic induction agents and inhalation agents be limited to avoid additional mater-nal hypotension and fetal hypoxia.\n\n【19】It is essential that this patient receives an honest and thorough postopera-tive visit. It is important to determine the extent of her recall， and to elicit whether the recall of intraoperative events is disturbing to her. Occasionally， patients experience recall of intraoperative events during emergency surgery， but are not particularly disturbed by the experience. Other patients a _are_ markedly traumatized by the recall of intraoperative events. Once the experi-ence has been documented， the patient should be offered a variety of services\n\n【20】to deal with any posttraumatic stress they may be experiencing because of recall. These services can include counseling and psychiatric services and in some instances may require medication. It is essential that the patient's feel-ings regarding intraoperative recall are not dismissed.\n\n【21】**APPROACH TO**\n\n【22】**The Patient with Recall**\n\n【23】**DEFINITIONS**\n\n【24】INTRAOPERATIVE AWARENESS： Recall (either explicit or implicit) of events occurring during general anesthesia in the operating room.\n\n【25】EXPLICIT RECALL： Remembering exact events that occurred with or with-out pain during the operation.\n\n【26】IMPLICIT RECALL： Recognition but not specific recall of events happening in the operating room during general anesthesia.\n\n【27】BISPECTRAL INDEX OR BIS MONITOR： A processed or spectral EEG which represents activity of the cerebral cortex. The EEG is very active when patients are awake but relatively quiet during anesthesia or natural sleep. The monitor processes the EEG signals into a single number with 100 representing fully awake and 0 representing electrical silence.\n\n【28】**CLINICAL APPROACH**\n\n【29】Intraoperative awareness is reported to occur in approximately 0.0068% to0.13% of general aanneesthetics performed in the United States. Despite the somewhat rare nature of recall， it is one of the most feared complications of general anesthesia and surgery. In contrast to the increasing public interest， awareness， and discussion of the incidence of intraoperative awareness， the American Society of Anesthesiologist Closed Claims database of malpractice claims indicates that there has been no substantial change in the liability associated with recall during anesthesia in the 1990s compared to previous reporting periods. It is possible， however， that there has been an increase in claims and judgments awarded that have not yet been detected by this data-base (see Table 47-1).\n\n【30】Despite the inability to predict precisely which patients may experience intraoperative recall， it is possible to suggest which patients may be at higher risk. Grouped by procedure， those at highest risks include patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgery， cesarean section， and emergency or trauma surgery performed at night. Grouped by patient characteristics， those at highest risks include patients of a younger age， an increased body weight，\n\n【31】| **Table 47-1 INFLATION-ADJUSTED PAYMENTS FOR AWARENESS OVER**  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **THREE DECADES**  |  |  |  |\n|  | **1970s**  | **1980s**  | **1990s**  |\n| **Claims for awareness**  | **7(1%)**  | **57 (2%)**  | **65(2%)**  |\n| **Payment made**  | **4(67%)**  | **32(62%)**  | **31(52%)**  |\n| **Median payment amount in 1999 dollars**  | **$32，060**  | **$21，455**  | **S33.599**  |\n\n【32】smokers， patients who are critically ill， and those who may have increased tolerance because of long-term use of alcohol， opiates， or amphetamines. Patients who primarily receive an opioid-based anesthetic rather than an inhalation anesthetic are also at higher risk for recall， as are patients who receive muscle relaxants during surgery.\n\n【33】Differing states of wakefulness and：recall may be reported by different patients. The smallest group of patients experiencing recall (0.03%) report con-scious awareness and pain during surgery， and a desire “to scream during surgery but not being able to move.\" It is this group of patients that is most likely to experience symptoms of posttraumatic stress secondary to recall during surgery. A higher percentage of patients (0.1%-0.2%))may report nonpainful but explicit recall of intraoperative events. These patients may be able to report ver-batim conversations that occurred in the operating room during surgery， but do not report concomitant feelings of pain. The final group of patients may report nonspecific or amnesic awareness during surgery. These patients do not recall specific events or conversations that occur during surgery， but may have recog-nition recall of intraoperative events (Table 47-2).\n\n【34】| FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| INCREASED AWARENESS  |  |\n| Patient characteristics  | Younger age， increased weight， smokers， long-term  |\n|  | use of EtOH， opiates，or amphetamines  |\n| Types of surgery  | Cesarean section，coronary artery bypass grafting，  |\n|  | emergency surgery at night， trauma surgery  |\n| Anesthetic techniques  | Muscle relaxants， narcotic-based techniques，  |\n| Anesthetic techniques  | inadequate dosing， equipment malfunctions such  |\n|  | as empty vaporizers  |\n\n【35】| **Table 47-3 BISPECTRAL INDEX SCORES**  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **BIS NUMBER**  | **CLINICAL CORRELATION**  |\n| **100**  | **Patient awake and fully alert**  |\n| **40-60**  | **Patient anesthetized or natural sleep**  |\n| **0**  | **Electrical silence，no cerebral activity**  |\n\n【36】Manufacturers of processed EEG monitors have speculated that these mon-itors can reduce the incidence of intraoperative awareness. The company's formula for arriving at the bispectral index (BIS) number is proprietary but is predominantly determined by the patient’s EEG. Manufacturers suggest that the ideal range for anesthetic management and decreased intraoperative awareness is a BIS level of 40 to 60. Recent large randomized studies have indicated that the BIS monitor is no more reliable in preventing recall of intra-operative events than monitoring of the end-tidal concentrations of inhaled anesthetic agents. The BIS monitor is also not reliable at the extremes of age. In addition， certain anesthetics (nitrous oxide or NMDA antagonists such as ketamine) unquestionably produce anesthesia， but not a decrease in the BIS number because they cause less EEG suppression than other anesthetic drugs(Table 47-3).\n", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The episodes of \n\n【5】palpitation were associated with some light-headedness, but she had never fainted. \n\n【6】Her palpitation was at times related to some emotional upset or undue physical \n\n【7】exercise, but there was no history of exertional fatigue, chest pain or breathlessness. \n\n【8】There was also no history of tremor of the hands or weight loss. Her childhood \n\n【9】had been uneventful with normal growth milestones and there was no history of \n\n【10】cyanotic spells during sports activities. She also denied having had recurrent sore￾throat, joint pains or any prolonged febrile illness during her school days. \n\n【11】On examination, the patient was comfortable, relaxed and not dyspneic. There \n\n【12】was no tremor of the fingers, visible goiter or eye-signs of Grave’s disease. The JVP \n\n【13】was raised 5 cm above the angle of Louis and showed large v waves with a prominent \n\n【14】y descent. The pulse was regular, fair in volume, at a rate of 84 beats/min. and the \n\n【15】BP was 130/80 mm Hg. On examining the abdomen, there were visible epigastric \n\n【16】pulsations, with the liver edge 6 cm below the right costal margin and pulsatile; no \n\n【17】ascites was demonstrable. The apex beat was normal in nature and location but a left \n\n【18】parasternal heave was palpated. The S1\n\n【19】 and S2\n\n【20】 were both split with wide splitting of \n\n【21】S2\n\n【22】 appreciated during inspiration. No S3\n\n【23】 or S4\n\n【24】 gallop sound was heard. A pansystolic \n\n【25】murmur was audible at the lower end of the left sternal edge. Breathing was vesicular \n\n【26】and no rhonchi or crepts were heard over the lung fields. \n\n【27】CLINICAL DISCUSSION \n\n【28】From the history and physical examination, this patient had paroxysmal \n\n【29】tachycardia with clinical signs of tricuspid valve regurgitation. ECG showed tall \n\n【30】P waves (P. pulmonale) with normal P-R interval and right bundle branch block \n\n【31】(RBBB). X-ray chest finding was an enlarged cardiac silhouette, more so towards \n\n【32】the right of the midline. ECHO revealed normal sized left ventricle with normal \n\n【33】ejection fraction. The mitral and aortic valves were normal and the left atrium was \n\n【34】not dilated. There was no echo drop-out in the region of either septum. However, \n\n【35】the right atrium was markedly enlarged and the right ventricle was dilated as \n\n【36】well as hyperkinetic. The tricuspid valve was displaced downwards into the right \n\n【37】ventricle, with distal attachment of the septal tricuspid leaflet which showed 16 Section 1 Congenital Heart Diseases\n\n【38】exaggerated excursion. On colour flow mapping, a regurgitant jet was seen in \n\n【39】the right atrium. These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of Ebstein’s \n\n【40】anomaly. \n\n【41】In a young woman, history of episodic palpitation raises several clinical \n\n【42】possibilities. Anxiety neurosis, panic attacks and paroxysmal supraventricular \n\n【43】tachycardia are usual causes but in these, the heart is structurally normal. \n\n【44】Perimenopausal symptoms in women include palpitation but our patient was \n\n【45】young. Thyrotoxicosis is a possibility but our patient had no goiter, tremor or \n\n【46】eye-signs of Grave’s disease. Pre-excitation syndrome (WPW syndrome) may be \n\n【47】responsible for paroxysmal tachyarrhythmia but the ECG did not show short P-R \n\n【48】interval or delta waves on the QRS complex. Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) and \n\n【49】atrial septal defect (ASD) are structural cardiac abnormalities that are responsible \n\n【50】for tachyarrhythmias. However, in our case the mitral valve was normal and there \n\n【51】was no septal defect. \n\n【52】Ebstein’s anomaly is an uncommon congenital acyanotic heart disease \n\n【53】characterized by abnormal tricuspid valve architecture, tricuspid regurgitation \n\n【54】and association with paroxysmal supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. The physical \n\n【55】examination of the patient and interpretation of simple cardiac investigations is a \n\n【56】good exercise in bed-side clinical cardiology. A raised JVP with large v waves and \n\n【57】prominent y descent are characteristic of tricuspid regurgitation into the right \n\n【58】atrium (Fig. 4.1). So is an enlarged and pulsatile liver on abdominal examination. \n\n【59】A sustained left parasternal heave is indicative of right ventricular volume \n\n【60】overload. \n\n【61】Figure 4.1: Tricuspid regurgitation\n\n【62】The S1\n\n【63】 is split because of delayed tricuspid valve closure (T1\n\n【64】) due to right \n\n【65】bundle branch block (RBBB) as well as the wide excursion of the septal tricuspid \n\n【66】leaflet. The S2\n\n【67】 is widely split due to delayed pulmonary closure (P2\n\n【68】) because of the \n\n【69】RBBB. Sometimes, the S2\n\n【70】 is single because of soft P2\n\n【71】 due to low pulmonary ejection \n\n【72】volume. Rarely, the S2 is paradoxically split because of pre-excitation of the right \n\n【73】ventricle caused by WPW syndrome Type B. The pansystolic murmur of tricuspid \n\n【74】regurgitation is best audible over the lower left parasternal area and does not \n\n【75】radiate towards the axilla or the base of the heart. Like all right-sided murmurs, it Case 4 Ebstein’s Anomaly 17\n\n【76】increases in intensity during inspiration, provided the right ventricular function \n\n【77】is normal. \n\n【78】In sinus rhythm, the ECG shows tall P waves (P. pulmonale) due to right atrial \n\n【79】enlargement and wide QRS complexes due to right bundle branch block (RBBB). \n\n【80】Sometimes, wide QRS complexes are due to WPW syndrome, in which case there \n\n【81】is a short P-R interval (pre-excitation). At times, the rhythm is atrial fibrillation. \n\n【82】On X-ray chest, the cardiac silhouette is enlarged towards the right of the midline, \n\n【83】due to the large right atrium (Fig. 4.2). Superficially, this resembles a pericardial \n\n【84】effusion. The differentiating feature is that the right lower portion of the cardiac \n\n【85】silhouette curves inwards towards the center of the chest and not outwards, as it \n\n【86】would in case of pericardial effusion. \n\n【87】On ECHO apical view, there is downward displacement of the tricuspid \n\n【88】valve into the body of the right ventricle, towards the apex. The septal tricuspid \n\n【89】Figure 4.2: X-ray showing cardiomegaly due \n\n【90】to enlargement of right atrium\n\n【91】Figure 4.3: ECHO showing enlarged right atrium \n\n【92】with displaced tricuspid valve 18 Section 1 Congenital Heart Diseases\n\n【93】Table 4.1: Causes of tricuspid regurgitation\n\n【94】Valvular regurgitation\n\n【95】  •  Tricuspid valve prolapse\n\n【96】  •  Right-sided endocarditis\n\n【97】  •  Ebstein’s anomaly\n\n【98】  •  Carcinoid syndrome\n\n【99】  •  Endocardial cushion defect\n\n【100】  •  Endomyocardial fibrosis\n\n【101】  •  Connective tissue disease\n\n【102】Annular dilatation\n\n【103】  •  Pulmonary hypertension\n\n【104】  •  Pulmonary regurgitation\n\n【105】  •  Dilated cardiomyopathy\n\n【106】leaflet is attached to the IV septum, 10 mm or more distal to the anterior mitral \n\n【107】leaflet. The tricuspid leaflet is large and shows wide excursion, often with a \n\n【108】whip-like motion. The right ventricle is dilated and hyperkinetic due to volume \n\n【109】overload. The right atrium is enlarged because of tricuspid regurgitation as well \n\n【110】as due to “atrialization” of the upper portion of the right ventricle (Fig. 4.3). On \n\n【111】long-axis view, because of downward displacement of the tricuspid valve, there \n\n【112】is simultaneous recording of the mitral and tricuspid valves (MV and TV). On \n\n【113】short-axis view, the tricuspid valve is shifted clockwise, from the normal 9 0’clock \n\n【114】position to the 11 0’clock position. \n\n【115】The commonest reason for tricuspid regurgitation is dilatation of the tricuspid \n\n【116】valve annulus secondary to right ventricular dilatation. Reason for annular \n\n【117】dilatation is usually pulmonary hypertension due to congenital left-to-right \n\n【118】shunt, rheumatic mitral valve disease or chronic cor pulmonale. Sometimes, \n\n【119】dilated cardiomyopathy causes annular dilatation (Table 4.1). Primary tricuspid \n\n【120】valvular regurgitation has several causes except coronary artery disease and \n\n【121】systemic hypertension, the commonest forms of heart disease. Usual causes of \n\n【122】tricuspid valve regurgitation are tricuspid leaflet prolapse, Ebstein’s anomaly, \n\n【123】rheumatic heart disease, carcinoid syndrome and right-sided endocarditis. \n\n【124】Uncommon causes include endocardial cushion defects, endomyocardial fibro￾sis and connective tissue disorders. \n\n【125】MANAGEMENT ISSUES \n\n【126】The management of Ebstein’s anomaly includes the treatment of supraventricular \n\n【127】tachyarrhythmias and the control of tricuspid regurgitation. Drugs that block the \n\n【128】atrioventricular (AV) node to reduce the heart rate, such as betablockers and \n\n【129】verapamil, are the agents of choice. In the presence of WPW syndrome, amiodarone \n\n【130】is preferable. Digoxin may be used to treat atrial fibrillation in which case, an \n\n【131】anticoagulant is also prescribed to reduce the risk of thrombo-embolism. If the \n\n【132】tachyarrhythmias are refractory to drug treatment or an accessory bypass tract is \n\n【133】present, radiofrequency ablation can be offered. In the presence of moderate to \n\n【134】severe tricuspid regurgitation, valve repair with restrictive annuloplasty or even \n\n【135】valve replacement may be considered.

The terrariums contained soil, moss, live plants, and a shallow pool of water with small pebbles. They were arranged in three rows offour, with each group of four sharing a common ventilation system (cross-draft ventilation). Each terrarium had its own misting system. The temperature of the habitats varied from 82°F during the day to 69°F at night. The frogs were maintained on a daily full spectrum light cycle between 7 AM and 5 PM. The frog habitats were cleaned every 3 weeks at which time more compost was added to the substrate. The frogs were fed a variety of insects, such as fruit flies _(Drosophila melanogaster),_ meal worms _(Tenebrio molitor),_ wax worms (Pyralidae), beetle larvae (Coleoptera), and Springtails (Collem-bola).\n\n【7】Fig. 78.1 . The poison dart frog presented in a moribund condition.\n\n【8】Recently, the client had been experiencing approximately 5% mortality in his frog population. The normal mortality was death of a frog once a month. Five frogs were found dead the week prior to presentation of this frog, and he had lost three frogs the previous week. It was noted that the frogs became thin before they died or thin dead frogs were found in the habitats.﻿\n\n【9】Physical Examination Findings\n\n【10】On physical examination, the frog was poorly responsive. Its skin appeared dry and had a granular texture. Gentle scraping of the skin provided a sample for a wet mount preparation that was later stained with Wright–Giemsa stain. The wet mount preparation revealed several tiny motile organisms when viewed under a 100x objective ( Figs. 78.2a and 78.2b ).﻿\n\n【11】Interpretive Discussion\n\n【12】Figure 78.2a shows a highly cellular sample with numerous erythrocytes. The background contains a variety of extracellular bacteria. A heterophil can be found in the upper right-hand corner of the image. The oval structures in the center have a distinct cell wall and multiple nuclei. These structures resemble the thalli or zoosporangia of the chytrid fungus, _Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis,_ when they contain multiple discrete zoospores (Pessier et al., 1999). Figure 78.2b is a highly cellular sample that also contains what appears to be the zoosporangia of the chytrid fungus.\n\n【13】Fig. 78.2 .

The histopathology of the skin lesion from the poison dart frog (HE stain, 40x).﻿\n\n【16】Summary\n\n【17】The frog died shortly after presentation and was submitted for necropsy that revealed no gross necropsy lesions other than thickening of the skin.\n\n【18】Histopathologic examination revealed focal aggregates of round 4–5 µm tear-drop-shaped, encapsulated, single-celled organisms embedded within the epithelium but only to the basal membrane. Often, a narrow tubular structure like a spout was located on one end of the capsule. Some contained multiple 1–2 µm basophilic spores. Areas infested with the organisms were thickened and revealed hyperkeratosis with sloughing of the outer layers of the skin. There was no underlying dermal inflammation. These histologic findings were indicative of the chytrid fungus, _B. dendrobatidis_ .The chytrid zoosporangia that appeared as circular spaces with a homogenous appearance in the thickened epidermis likely represented immature stages of the sporangium, whereas those containing multiple discrete spores contained the mature zoospores ready to be released. The empty spaces represented the sporangia that have discharged their zoospores ( Figs. 78.3 and 78.4 ).\n\n【19】Figures 78.3a and 78.3b reveal chytrid zoosporan-gia in the sloughed stratum corneum of the skin of the poison dart frog. Figure 78.4 shows an empty chytrid zoosporangium with a discharge tube or papillum.\n\n【20】Skin scrapings from frogs contain epithelial cells, soil debris, algae, and nonchytrid fungi. Congo red stain has been shown to delineate the chytrid zoosporangia from these structures and can be used as a rapid screening test for chytridiomycosis (Briggs and Burgin, 2003).\n\n【21】The client likely introduced the chytrid fungus into his collection when he recently obtained a shipment of new frogs from another breeding facility. The fungus uses keratin as substrate and its growth is restricted to highly keratinized structures. This results in hyperker-atosis of the skin, and death of the frog is related to disruption of the skin's osmotic regulation and supplementary respiration function. The adult frogs in the collection were treated topically using an antifungal agent (1% itraconazole suspension diluted to 0.01% with 0.6% saline as daily 5-minute immersions for 10 days). Also, the frogs were maintained at 37°F for 24 hours in an effort to kill the temperature-sensitive zoospores in the environment and to boost the immune system of the frogs. Larval stages (tadpoles) were treated using 0.1 ppm malachite green 24-hour baths. It was recommended that the habitats be thoroughly cleaned by removing all the plants and substrate and treated with a 0.4% bleach solution followed by leaving them to remain dry for 1 month. The client did not follow the habitat cleaning advice, but continued to treat tadpoles using the malachite green baths. His frog collection experienced no further deaths from the chytrid fungus.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The history is consistent with this diagnosis because of the timing with the menstrual cycle.\n\n【47】**What additional information/questions are needed?**\n\n【48】_●_ Ask Dina how often she participates in sexual activity and whether it is with males， females， or both. Ask whether she uses condoms 100% of the time? Obtain more detailed information about sexual activity to help to determine the risks of STI and pregnancy.\n\n【49】●Does she have a history of sexually transmitted disease or signs and symptoms of sexually trans-mitted infections? This information will help to rule out infection and/or PID.\n\n【50】Ask whether she has tried anything for the cramps and whether it worked. Prostaglandin inhibi-tors and OCPs are the first lines of therapy for primary dysmenorrhea. If a patient is already using these medications without relief of symptoms， consider causes of secondary dysmenorrhea and other diagnoses.\n\n【51】Has she always had cramps or is this a more recent change? Primary dysmenorrhea typically presents 2 years after the onset of menarche when cycles become ovulatory. It is most common to hear complaints of menstrual pain from adolescents in the age range 14-18 years old. If an adolescent presents with menstrual pain before the age of 14 or first experiences menstrual pain after the age of 19， consider causes of secondary dysmenorrhea.\n\n【52】Is there a family history of endometriosis? Endometriosis should be considered if Dina has a positive family history of endometriosis in a first-degree relative. The risk of endometriosis increases in the case of relatives with more severe disease\n\n【53】●Does she have a history of diarrhea， constipation， generalized abdominal pain， or passing gas? Information can help rule out gastrointestinal disorders such as Irritable Bowel Syndrome， lactose intolerance， constipation， and inflammatory bowel disease.\n\n【54】●Does she have a history of psychosocial problems? A positive history of cigarette smoking， trauma， abuse， anxiety， depression， or other somatic complaints has been associated with symp-toms of dysmenorrhea.\n\n【55】**What questions would you ask Dina about her menstrual cycle?**\n\n【56】●What was her age at menarche? Primary dysmenorrhea usually presents within the first 3 years after menarche. During the first 2 years following menarche， cycles are highly irregular and anovulatory. Once ovulation starts to occur， the amount of prostaglandin responsible for the symptoms associated with dysmenorrhea increases.\n\n【57】What are her number of days of bleeding and the number of hygienic products used in 24 hours? If Dina's cycles last longer than 7 days or if her cycles require frequent changes of feminine hygiene products， consider a workup for bleeding disorders.\n\n【58】Ask her to describe her symptoms. Complaints of lower abdominal， back， and/or thigh pain within the first 48 hours of menstruation are typical of patients with primary dysmenorrhea. Associated systemic symptoms include nausea， vomiting， mood change， fatigue， and headache. If breast tenderness or bloating is reported consider diagnosis of PMS.\n\n【59】Ask Dina when she experiences the onset of pain. Symptoms of primary dysmenorrhea usually peak in the first 48 hours of menstrual flow. The first 2 days of menstruation are associated with the highest level of prostaglandin in menstrual fluid. Consider premenstrual syndrome if Dina reports symptoms of pain and discomfort in the luteal phase， day 14 through 28， of the menstrual cycle.\n\n【60】**What is the plan of treatment?**\n\n【61】Reduce prostaglandin release by starting Dina on NSAID therapy. Treatment can be started before menstruation， with the onset of symptoms， or with the beginning of menstruation. After starting a specific NSAID， wait 2-3 cycles before switching medications if symptoms are not alleviated. Failure of NSAID treatment should not be determined unless they have been tried for longer than 6 months. NSAID treatment helps to lessen symptoms of primary dysmenorrhea in 80% of patients (Table 5.4.1).\n\n【62】Start Dina on OCPs to inhibit ovulation， thered110reby reducing prostaglandin release. Once started， OCPs should be used for 3-4 months before considering treatment a failure. Success of OCP therapy in relieving the symptoms of primary dysmenorrhea is greater than 90%. A combination of OCPs and NSAIDs should be tried for those who failed individual therapies.\n\n【63】**Are there other options?**\n\n【64】For the 10% of patients who do not respond to NSAID and OCP therapy， the following is a list of treatments to be considered. Limited research exists for the following alternative therapies.\n\n【65】Transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS)\n\n【66】Laparoscopic presacral neurectomy\n\n【67】TABLE 5.4.1.

In 10–15 per cent of cases of renal \n\n【36】colic, the dipstick will be negative for blood. The differential diagnosis includes pyelonephri￾tis, diverticulitis, bowel obstruction, peptic ulcer disease and gynaecological conditions such \n\n【37】as ectopic pregnancy, torted ovarian cyst or tubo-ovarian abscess. In addition to the above, \n\n【38】on the right side, appendicitis and biliary colic should also be considered. In an older patient, \n\n【39】it is important to exclude a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.\n\n【40】The pain of renal colic is caused by the distension of the ureter or collecting system from an \n\n【41】obstructing calculus. The pain may radiate from loin to groin and to the tip of the penis in \n\n【42】males and to the labia in females (the latter being typical in males and females, respectively, of \n\n【43】a stone at the vesico-uretric junction). Calculi may also irritate the bladder, causing urgency, \n\n【44】frequency and strangury.\n\n【45】The gold standard investigation in the work-up of renal colic is a non-contrast computerized \n\n【46】tomography (CT) KUB (kidneys, ureter, bladder) scan. This has a sensitivity of 94–100 per \n\n【47】cent and specificity of 92–100 per cent. Advantages of CT KUB compared with more tradi￾tional tests such as intravenous urogram include the possibility to diagnose other conditions, \n\n【48】accuracy of stone measurement, quick test and does not require administration of intrave￾nous contrast and its potential pitfalls, e.g. allergy and chemotoxic reaction in patients with \n\n【49】renal insufficiency.

{"seq_id": "772ed7d2-f0f7-49e2-95e6-e849998ebe20", "title": null, "text": "【0】SELECTED EXISTENTIAL THEMES\n---------------------------\n\n【1】Several topics have been selected to illustrate the thinking of existentialists and the relevance of their ideas to a broad range of clients.\n\n【2】### Emotional Suffering\n\n【3】Suffering cannot be eliminated from life. Anxiety is a natural part of life and an unavoidable consequence of taking risks and experiencing growth and change. Normal anxiety needs to be contrasted with “neurotic anxiety,” which constricts rather than contributes to the self-actualizing process of individuals. Guilt is another emotion that can carry different messages. Ordinarily, people feel guilty because of violating an internal rule regarding what they believe to be right and wrong behavior. Existential guilt, in contrast, comes from the awareness that one is not living an authentic existence and is refusing to grow. Clinical issues can stem from an avoidance and denial of these normal emotional experiences, as when people numb themselves or engage in self-deception. Existentialists view painful emotions as useful signals that can help a person live more effectively, rather than as symptoms that should be medicated away. In this framework, the goal of therapy is to enhance, rather than reduce, a client’s awareness of unpleasant feelings, visceral sensations, and inner dialogue.\n\n【4】One of the most puzzling and frustrating aspects of human functioning is that people will feel trapped in situations that they describe as unbearably painful, when from an outsider’s perspective, they are clearly free to leave. We can speculate that some people have high thresholds for pain, or imagine a cost-benefit analysis where the pain of the current situation is less than the feared pain of choosing an alternative path. Motivation for change sometimes requires an intense experience of pain; therefore, an intermediate process goal might be to help the client feel worse instead of better. Using the metaphor of someone sitting in a seat that is uncomfortably warm, and asking: _What does it take for the client to stand up and walk away_ ? The answer is, _When the chair gets hot enough, a person will get off_ .\n\n【5】### Meaning and Purpose in Life\n\n【6】Existential philosophers describe the human condition as the dilemma of meaning-seeking creatures thrown into a universe that has no intrinsic meaning. The realization of this lack of meaning is an encounter with “the absurd”; the corresponding emotion is described by Sartre (1959) as “nausea” and may be experienced by clients as emptiness—a void. To invest meaning in a path that will bring you fulfillment, it is necessary to increase awareness of your feelings, desires, talents, ideals, and goals. Existentialists believe that it is better to live authentically, to fulfill your highest potential, and to use inner values to shape your life, than to follow a path ordained by others.\n\n【7】When we are young, we derive meaning from the rules and examples of our parents, which originated in the customs and traditions of their cultures. Many people live contented lives continuing to accept the meaning that was given to them. However, other people experience a crisis of meaning, perhaps following a major loss or when they reach the pinnacle of the road they were told would bring fulfillment. At each transition point in the life span, people inevitably find that there is a disruption in the system of meaning on which they were relying. For instance, at the “empty nest” stage, a parent no longer finds meaning by focusing on the needs of minor children. The crisis of meaning, regardless of cause, is usually accompanied by painful emotional states, including disillusionment, emptiness, grief, and confusion.\n\n【8】Complaints of meaninglessness must always be understood in their cultural context as each culture offers different values (e.g., community versus individualism; material success versus time with family) and views on issues such as obligations to aging parents, the status of unmarried women, and the importance of leisure. Existential discussions do not take place in a cultural vacuum. To the degree that the crisis of meaning is directly related to cultural causes, the Cultural Issues (SC2) hypothesis should be integrated.\n\n【9】### The Question of Suicide\n\n【10】In his essay, _The Myth of Sisyphus_ , Albert Camus (1991) uses a Greek myth to explore both the loss and the creation of meaning. As a punishment from the gods, Sisyphus spends his life pushing a heavy boulder to the top of a mountain. When it reaches the top, it rolls to the bottom, and he follows it down to put his shoulder to it again, and start pushing uphill. Camus focuses on that moment at the bottom: The task is obviously meaningless, boring, and painful, and there is no intrinsic purpose in continuing it—so why continue, if the choice of suicide is available? Camus wrote, “Dying voluntarily implies that you have recognized . . . the absence of any profound reason for living, the insane character of that daily agitation, and the uselessness of suffering” (p. 6). When a person seriously ponders the question of suicide and decides not to carry through with it, he is positively affirming his life and making a freely chosen commitment. The project he is engaged in is no longer just a meaningless punishment; it is a voluntary undertaking and carries whatever meaning he invests in it, including one that can result in joy.\n\n【11】When therapists face people who are contemplating suicide, they frequently panic. They focus on assessing risk, taking emergency measures, getting medication evaluation, and doing whatever possible to get rid of the suicidal thoughts. Although all of these actions are essential (see Emergency \\[CS1\\] hypothesis), they are insufficient: The client needs someone to listen calmly and patiently and help her explore the crisis of meaning and the issues that have made life unbearable. When people have terminal illnesses, we consider it reasonable for them to contemplate how suicide will allow them to die with dignity and relieve their loved ones of burdens. However, when someone, by our standards, has sufficient reasons to find satisfaction in life, we are apt to label his or her wishes as abnormal, irrational, selfish, or transient symptoms of depression. An existential approach to such a client would be to listen empathically and explore possibilities of creating new meaning, while respecting the client’s right to make a lucid choice based on his own values.\n\n【12】### Death and Dying\n\n【13】The theme of death enters therapeutic discourse in many forms besides the question of suicide. People need support when they are coping with the death of a loved one or when they are dealing with their own impending death. Frequently, near-death experiences, like a car accident, or exposure to major catastrophes, like an earthquake or a terrorist attack, can make people ponder the significance of their lives. For people who are young and in good health, contemplating the inevitability and unpredictability of death puts a spotlight on the choices they make and forces them to look at how those choices will affect the course of their lives. In HIV prevention programs for teens, one strategy is to increase their awareness of their vulnerability to dying from AIDS. When the possibility of death becomes personal, they are more likely to change their current high-risk behaviors.\n\n【14】### Aloneness and Isolation\n\n【15】Therapeutic strategies that increase interpersonal skills and reduce social anxiety can help lonely and isolated people have more fulfilling social relationships. However, existential philosophers claim that there is no way of eliminating basic existential isolation, which is a given of the human condition. The phrase “We are born alone and we die alone” reminds us that no matter how close we feel with our loved ones, there are limits to what we can share. Although deep empathic attunement helps bridge the gap between people, people are justified in reminding each other, “You don’t know how I feel, you’re not inside my skin.” Fortunately, according to existentialists, the full experience of our separateness is not just a source of pain, it also opens the door to many positive experiences such as the enjoyment of solitude, a sense of independence, and the relinquishment of unrealistic expectations of other people. Relationships built on a denial of the basic separateness between people show many destructive patterns: trying to control others as if they were possessions, treating conflicting opinions as if a separate point of view were a dire threat, and living vicariously through the other person instead of pursuing one’s own goals.\n\n【16】### Fulfillment of Potential\n\n【17】People often come to therapy wanting more than relief from their symptoms or a restoration of how they were before the current crisis. There is a yearning for a higher quality of living or the need to wrestle with deep questions and find a new orientation to life. These clients want to be responsible adults without sacrificing the vitality and sense of play of childhood. They want challenge and excitement in their daily lives, instead of stagnation and boredom. Typical goals might include fulfillment of their potential; a sense of control over their future paths; becoming more spontaneous and creative; feeling more alive, real, and whole; and achieving authentic contact with their inner being as well as with other humans. These people may be suffering from what Maslow called the _psychopathology of the average._\n\n【18】### Authenticity\n\n【19】Existentialists believe that it is essential to face, honestly, “what is,” instead of filtering experience through illusions, fantasies, and fictions. People, in creating their lives, have a choice between living authentically or living lives of dishonesty and self-deception. Some of the illusions that must be discarded are the very ones that gave us comfort in childhood: Life is fair. If I am really good, I will be taken care of. Things happen for a reason. When asked to look inward for our true values and feelings, there can be the sense that there is nothing there—I am nothing more than the social roles I live or the opinions that others have of me. When people let go of inauthentic ways of living, there may be confusion and disorientation similar to the experience of culture shock when people take up extended residence in a different culture: The familiar frameworks and rules no longer operate and we lose the certainty and confidence that has built up over a lifetime.\n\n【20】Authenticity in human relations is a standard that many people have trouble living up to, and therapists who are not capable of it in their own personal relationships will not be able to provide this needed ingredient in the therapeutic relationship. When you are engaged in an authentic encounter, you would be (a) present in the moment rather than adrift on a mental side trip; (b) genuine and not hiding behind masks; (c) honest and truthful about what you choose to express, reserving the right to decline to reveal what you hold private; (d) open and vulnerable, allowing yourself to be impacted and changed by the other; and (e) willing to take the risk of being spontaneous. Spontaneity does not mean saying whatever comes into your head; people who value relationships and have empathy for others can choose to express their honest views in ways that are constructive to the recipient. A precondition for authenticity with others is that you are vigilant against self-deception and have learned to hold yourself accountable for your own dishonesties.\n\n【21】### When Is This Hypothesis a Good Match?\n\n【22】Because this hypothesis embraces universal aspects of the human condition, it can be used as a lens with many clients, and serves as an invaluable counterweight to the tendency to rely too much on _DSM_ diagnostic categories. Table 12.1 suggests a range of problem areas relevant for this hypothesis.\n\n【23】Table 12.1 Sample Problems for Existential Issues (ES1) Hypothesis\n\n【24】| Depression and Dysphoria | Complaint that “life has no meaning” despite outward success.Feeling empty, alone, and insignificant.Emotional pain following major losses and catastrophes. |\n| --- | --- |\n| Anxiety | Unexplained, generalized anxiety.Difficulty coping with anxiety that is a normal accompaniment to taking risks, seeking growth, and accepting challenges.Unable to tolerate minor deviations from routine. |\n| Lack of Awareness of True Desires | Out of touch with wants and needs.Lack of “passion” or “vocation.”Dependence of approval and guidance from others.Perfectionistic, super-responsible lifestyle. |\n| Coping With Loss and Death | Difficulty coping with loss (integrate with Loss and Bereavement \\[CS4\\] hypothesis).Distress over disability and loss of functioning (integrate with Biological Cause \\[BE1\\] hypothesis).Suicidal ideation.Terminal illness (of self or loved ones).Difficulties coping with challenges of old age. |\n| Challenges of Intimacy and Separateness | Unable to connect to intimate partner in an authentic and vulnerable way.Unable to tolerate aloneness.Difficulty tolerating the separateness of partner (excessive jealousy, possessiveness, efforts to control). |\n| Lack of Growth, Fulfillment, and Actualization | Distress over lack of challenge and risk-taking in life.Bored and “burned out” from long term employment.Complains of not living up to potential.Longing to be more creative and spontaneous.Confused and ambivalent over cultural demands (e.g., to enter father’s business, accept arranged marriage, assume caretaking functions for elderly parent). |\n\n【25】_Existential_ is a term that sounds intellectual and may mistakenly be assumed to be relevant only for highly educated clients, and particularly for European and Euro-American cultural groups. There may be a concern that existential therapists would be insensitive to the needs of someone from an interdependent collectivist culture. On the contrary, existential issues (e.g., searching for meaning in times of crisis, dealing with suffering, and worrying about the quality of one’s life) are universal. Schneider’s (2008) integrative approach to existential psychotherapy is applied to many cultural groups; race, ethnicity, and culture are automatically addressed in exploring the phenomenology of each client. It may come as a surprise that China held a “First International Conference on Existential Psychotherapy” in April 2010, co-sponsored by the Society for Humanistic Psychology (Division 32 of the American Psychological Association).\n\n【26】Adolescents struggle with existential issues without having the words to describe them, and elderly adults, coping with aging and diminishing health, also resonate to existential themes. People with disabilities, especially those that resulted in a dramatic loss of function, are good candidates for an exploration of meaning. Furthermore, instead of being a philosophy that endorses elitism, existentialism is compatible with a commitment to social justice. In discussing the possibilities for meaningful lives within a given sociocultural context, the dialogue may address issues of social injustice, institutionalized oppression, and discrimination (see hypothesis Social Problem Is a Cause \\[SC5\\] for discussion). Activism for social change, as with the feminist and gay rights movements, is a path for not only changing society but also creating new meaning in the activist’s life.\n\n【27】", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

He reports an 8-month history of progressive lightening of the skin on the hands as well as the face, around the nose and mouth. He denies any history of contact with chemicals or a history of burns. He has no other medical conditions and family history is notable for autoimmune thyroid disease in his mother and type I diabetes in his brother. On examination, there are confluent patches of depigmentation overlying the dorsal hands and wrists with no underlying erythema ( 45 ). Examination of the skin under Woods lamp demonstrates enhancement of the depigmented patches with white-blue fluorescence.\n\n【4】i. What is the diagnosis and what are some associated disorders seen with this disease?\n\n【5】ii. What condition(s) should be considered if the patient had concurrent ocular disease?\n\n【6】iii. What treatment options are available?\n\n【7】Answer 45\n\n【8】i. This patient presents with depigmentation of the skin that is characteristic of vitiligo, an acquired disorder that consists of progressive loss of functional melanocytes, leading to depigmented macules and patches. Although the pathogenesis of vitiligo is not completely understood, it is thought that there may be a genetic component that leads predisposed individuals to develop autoimmune destruction of melanocytes, as well as a possible intrinsic defect in melanocytes that lead to reduced survival and dysregulation of apoptosis.\n\n【9】Vitiligo has a predilection for the head and neck and anatomic regions subject to repeated trauma or friction, such as the hands, wrists, knees and lower legs. On the face, periorificial involvement (around the eyes, nose and mouth) is common. In lightly pigmented individuals, a Wood’s lamp can be used to highlight the difference between normally pigmented skin and depigmented areas. Although most cases are asymptomatic, vitiligo can be mildly pruritic and psychosocially challenging to patients.\n\n【10】There are multiple clinical variants of vitiligo. Some lesions of vitiligo are referred to as inflammatory vitiligo due to the presence of a figurate erythematous border at the margin of depigmentation. Trichrome vitiligo describes a patch that consists of an intermediate zone of hypopigmentation between zones of normal pigmentation and depigmentation.\n\n【11】ii. The most significant ocular abnormality associated with vitiligo is uveitis, due to the presence of pigment cells in the uveal tract. Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada syndrome is characterized by uveitis, vitiligo (usually of the head and neck) with poliosis and aseptic meningitis. Alezzandrini syndrome is a rare disease that consists of decreased visual acuity and an atrophic iris associated with depigmentation of the skin on the ipsilateral face as well as poliosis.\n\n【12】iii. The course of vitiligo is unpredictable. It is typically a progressive disease. The goal of treatment is repigmentation and halting disease progression. First-line topical treatments include topical steroids and topical calcineurin inhibitors such as tacrolimus. Repigmentation occurs over the course of months, and occurs in a perifollicular pattern. Other treatments include phototherapy, excimer laser therapy and surgical treatment with autologous transplantation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "38f6b621-c185-45f2-9a15-7d579cb2faa0", "title": null, "text": "【0】**CASE 1**\n\n【1】An 8-year-old boy is brought to a psychiatrist by his parents because he is having increasing difficulty keeping up academically with his classmates. His parents report that he has always been a slow learner but that they were not really aware of how significant their son's difficulties were until this year， when their other child， a 5-year-old girl， started school. Their daughter is progressing much more quickly and easily than their 8-year-old son did. His teacher says that their son is pleasant but is behind the class in the acquisition of skills in all areas.In preschool， the teacher reported that he had a tendency to hit others， but he does this much less often now. He gets along with other children well，although he seems to enjoy the company of his younger sibling's friends over his same-age peers.\n\n【2】The parents report that their son met all his developmental milestones at the low end of the normally expected range， but their pediatrician told them not to be concerned. He has never had any significant medical illnesses. He had an uneventful prenatal period and birth.\n\n【3】What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【4】What are the next diagnostic steps?\n\n【5】What is the role of the psychiatrist in the care of this patient?\n\n【6】Summary： An 8-year-old boy is brought to a psychiatrist presenting with\n\n【7】Being a\"slow learner”\n\n【8】Falling behind his peers in class\n\n【9】\\*上History of aggression in preschool， though he's \"grown out\"of this behavior\n\n【10】1No significant current or past medical conditions\n\n【11】Younger sister surpassing him in academic and social skills\n\n【12】Most likely diagnosis： Mild intellectual disability.\n\n【13】Diagnostic steps： Some form of individualized intelligence testing is required in addition to an assessment of the patient's current adaptive functioni11nng. It would be prudent to supplement intelligence testing with other educational testing to ensure that the patient does not have learning disabilities that inhibit his performance on the intelligence tests， thus producing a lower intelligence quotient (IQ) score than would otherwise occur.\n\n【14】Role of the psychiatrist in the care of this patient： The psychiatrist plays a number of critical roles in the treatment of those with intellectual disabilities. The first is confirming that a complete evaluation (including karyotyping when appropri-ate) had been performed for syndromes associated with intellectual disability and appropriate interventions (ie， dietary， hormonal replacement) undertaken. Second，35% to 40% of people with intellectual disability have another psychiatric disor-der. The psychiatrist must make sure the symptoms of any psychiatric disorder are diagnosed and that these symptoms are not misattributed to the intellectual disability. The psychiatrist must then provide adequate treatment. Finally， if there are no acute symptoms requiring medication management， a child psychiatrist typi-cally serves to ensure that the need for services by other mental health professionals is properly coordinated.\n\n【15】**ANALYSIS**\n\n【16】_Objectives_\n\n【17】1\\. Understand the diagnostic criteria for intellectual disability (Table 1-1).(EPA 1，2，3)\n\n【18】2\\. Understand the role of the psychiatrist in the treatment of intellectual dis-ability. (EPA 4，9)\n\n【19】**_Considerations_**\n\n【20】An 8-year-old boy is brought to a psychiatrist because his parents have noticed that he has global deficits in both social and educational skills. When intelligence testing is completed， the child will likely score in the mildly deficient range. He will also likely score in the deficient range on adaptive testing.\n\n【21】**Table1-1·DSM-5DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY (INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDER， FORMERLY MENTAL RETARDATION)**\n\n【22】A. Deficits in reasoning，problem solving， planning， abstract thinking，judgment， academic learn-ing， and experiential learning confirmed by clinical assessment and individualized， standardized intelligence testing.\n\n【23】B. And concurrent deficits in adaptive functioning that limit functioning in key areas of daily life like communication， social participation and independent living， and result in the individual failing to meet developmental and societal standards for personal independence and social responsibility without social supports in multiple environments.\n\n【24】C. With onset during the developmental period.\n\n【25】**APPROACH TO：Intellectual Disability**\n\n【26】**DEFINITIONS**\n\n【27】ADAPTIVE FUNCTIONING TESTS： Psychological assessments that measure social， communication， daily living， and community functioning skills. A collat-eral source who knows the patient well is required to answer questions needed to complete the assessment. Some of these skills can be measured with the Vineland Social Maturity Scale， a commonly used test.\n\n【28】DOWN SYNDROME： Trisomy 21， which is associated with hypotonia，language and motor developmental delay， and typical facial features. It is the most common cause of moderate to severe intellectual disability in the United States.\n\n【29】FRAGILE X SYNDROME： The second most common cause of intellectual dis-ability in the United States， resulting from a mutation at the Xq27.3 locus. Males generally have moderate to severe intellectual disability， while female carriers are less severely affected.\n\n【30】INTELLIGENCE TESTS： Psychological assessments that measure intellectual capacity. The results of these tests vary based on educational attainment. The most commonly used tests include the Wechsler scales (the Wechsler Preschool and Pri-mary Scale of Intelligence， the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children， and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale) and the Stanford-Binet Scale.\n\n【31】**CLINICAL APPROACH**\n\n【32】_Pathophysiology_\n\n【33】The prevalence of intellectual disability is approximately 1% of the population， with males being more affected than females. There are a multitude of etiologies， including genetics， prenatal infections and toxins， prematurity， and acquired con-ditions. In one-third of individuals， no cause can be identified. Down syndrome， fragile X syndrome， fetal alcohol syndrome， and phenylketonuria (PKU)are\n\n【34】common etiologies for moderate to severe intellectual disability. Mild intellectual disability is often associated with a familial pattern. A diagnosis of this disorder requires a diminished capacity for cognitive functioning measured by an objec-tive intelligence test， as well as a diminished capacity for adaptive functioning in multiple environments (refer to Table 1-2 for degrees of impairment in a patient's ability to conceptualize， socialize， and practically function on a day-to-day basis). The causes of intellectual disability are as numerous as are the treatments. General causes include genetic prenatal problems such as chromosomal abnormalities or mutations， prenatal causes related to an external source such as toxins or infec-tions， and postnatal causes such as anoxia， infection， or social deprivation experi-enced by an infant after birth.\n\n【35】Specific communication or learning disorders must be differentiated from intel-lectual disability， which is associated with greater global functional impairment. Patients with pervasive development disorder frequently have uneven areas of deficit， particularly regarding social interaction skills. Onset must be before the age of 18. If the impairment is noted after the age of 18 years， dementia and its various causes should be considered.\n\n【36】**_Ireatment_**\n\n【37】Prevention and Minimization. There are several principles behind the treatment of intellectual disability. The first is the concept of prevention. Whenever pos-sible， potential causes of intellectual disability should be minimized： Women should abstain from drinking alcohol during pregnancy， should receive appropriate immunizations before becoming pregnant， and should get proper nutrition includ-ing folic acid and other vitamin supplements. The next specific treatment involves the minimization of causes wherever possible. The best example of this is diet restrictions for babies born with PKU. Although the genetic problem cannot be corrected， the environmental exposure that allows this problem to be manifested can be controlled. The next level of treatment involves interventions designed to lessen the impact of intellectual disability early in a child’s life. These might include early education， speech therapy， occupational therapy， family support， and respite care.\n\n【38】_Targeting Comorbid Medical and Psychologic Problems. Appropriate medical_ care should also be provided， as medical problems can complicate the progress of a child with intellectual disability. Finally， clinicians should realize that depres-sion， anxiety， psychosis， and conduct disorders are common in the intellectual disability population but often go undetected. The reason for this is that these comorbid disorders often present with behavioral disturbance or aggression that is attributed to the patient having an intellectual disability rather than being seen as a symptom of the underlying psychiatric disorder. Any significant change in behavior in a patient suffering from intellectual disability should result in a care-ful examination with information from multiple sources to tease out the pres-ence of any psychiatric or general medical illness. Specific treatments for these disorders in this population do not usually differ from treatments for those in the general population.\n\n【39】| Table1-2·DEGREES OF INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Severity ofRetardation  | ConceptualDomain  | Social Domain  | Practical Domain  |\n| Mild  | While potentially hav- ing no deficits in pre-school， by school agehas difficulty learningacademics withoutgreater support.Asadult， uses concretethinking to approachproblems with deficitsin abstract thinking，executive functioning， and memory.  | Immature in social inter-actions， language use more concrete， difficultyregulating emotion， poorunderstanding of risk withimmature social judg- ment， and at risk of beingmanipulated because ofgullibility.  | While potentially able tokeep upage-appropriatepersonal care， needs helpwith complex daily livingtasks， requires support tobe able to engage in recre-ation， works jobs not need-ing conceptual skill，andneeds help with legal andhealth care decisions.  |\n| Moderate  | Even before school， language and motorskills are delayed， aca-demics in school aremarkedly limited，andeven as adult doesnot progress beyondelementary level.Needs daily assistanceas adult to completesimple day-to-day tasks.  | Marked delays in socialand communicative behavior，speech is muchless complex but still primary tool for com-munication，and can havesatisfying relationshipsbut understands social cues inaccurately.Caretak-ers must assist with lifedecisions， with high socialsupport needed for future work success.  | Can care for personal needs but requires extended teaching andreminders.Ongoing sup-ports are needed after extended teaching ofhousehold tasks.

Skin biopsy showed a sparse, superficial, perivascular dermatitis with suprabasal acantholysis. Direct immunofluorescence was positive for IgG and C3 in an intercellular pattern. The patient was started on prednisone at 80 mg per day by an outside dermatologist 1 month prior to referral. Her disease flared when she attempted to taper the prednisone below 80 mg per day, with painful erosions that interfered with eating on her left and right buccal mucosa, and on the left side of her mouth, as well as extensive erosions on her chest and back, and some erosions on her legs.\n\n【13】Based on the case description, what is the next step in treatment?\n\n【14】Treatment\n---------\n\n【15】Adjuvant rituximab\n\n【16】Discussion\n----------\n\n【17】Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is a potentially life-threatening autoimmune bullous dermatosis of the skin and/or mucous membranes caused by autoantibodies against the cadherins desmoglein 1 and desmoglein 3. Standard treatment of PV requires high-dose prednisone at 1–2 mg/kg/day that may be combined with other immunosuppressive medications such as cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil. Per the International Pemphigus Committee’s 2008 consensus statement, failure of PV therapy is defined as the, “continued development of new lesions, continued extension of old lesions, or failure of established lesions to begin to heal despite 3 weeks of therapy on 1.5 mg/kg/day of prednisone” with or without the additional immunosuppressive agents mentioned above \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【18】For patients with refractory PV, contraindications to immunosuppressive therapies, and/or severe and debilitating PV that will not likely respond to a standard treatment regimen, therapy focuses on depleting the desmoglein antibodies. Rituximab and/or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) are used in such cases. Rituximab is generally preferred due to the better side effect profile and lower cost.\n\n【19】### Rituximab\n\n【20】Rituximab is an IgG antibody that targets the CD20 antigen of B lymphocytes, the precursor cell to antibody producing plasma cells. It depletes the pathogenic desmoglein antibodies in PV for 6–12 months \\[ 2 \\]. Rituximab is FDA approved for various leukemias and lymphomas, rheumatoid arthritis, and some vasculitides. It is used off-label for PV.\n\n【21】The optimal dosing protocol of rituximab for PV treatment is unclear. Initial PV treatment with rituximab used the lymphoma dosing protocol of four weekly 375 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> infusions. More recent studies examined the use of the rheumatoid arthritis dosing of 1,000 mg twice, 2 weeks apart. In a meta-analysis of 42 case reports and case series from 2000 to 2012 of rituximab therapy in PV patients recalcitrant to standard therapies, complete remission was achieved in 67 % (32/48) of patients from case reports and in 67 % (56/84) of patients from case series using the lymphoma protocol compared to 79 % (n = 59/75) of patients from case series following the RA protocol \\[ 3 \\]. Both dosing protocols required the concurrent use of prednisone and/or other systemic therapies. Seven patients following the lymphoma protocol did not respond to treatment, while no patients on the RA protocol were non-responders. Relapse occurred in 23 % (30/132) of patients on the lymphoma protocol and in 36 % (27/75) on the RA protocol. Overall, this meta-analysis found that patients in the RA protocol had a higher response rate, a higher relapse rate, a higher number of infections, and a lower mortality rate compared to the lymphoma protocol. A recent, prospective, randomized, observer blinded study of 22 patients with PV or pemphigus foliaceus (PF) found no difference in time to disease control between patients treated with low dose rituximab (two 500 mg doses, 15 days apart) compared to the higher dose RA protocol, although relapse was more common and more adjuvant immunosuppressive therapy was needed in the low dose group \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【22】A multicenter, prospective study of 14 PV patients with refractory disease treated with a single cycle of rituximab using the lymphoma protocol suggests that a second cycle of rituximab may be required only in relapse that cannot be controlled with first-line therapies. This study reported that 86 % (12/14) of subjects had complete remission of disease (defined as the epithelization of all skin and mucosal lesions) 3 months after the last infusion \\[ 5 \\]. Of the remaining two subjects, one had complete remission by 180 days and the other by 360 days. All patients that were concurrently treated with steroids were able to significantly reduce their baseline prednisone dose. At the 34 month follow-up, 57 % (8/14) of subjects remained free of disease.\n\n【23】In a later study, Lunardon et al. found that 100 % (24/24) of severe and/or refractory PV patients treated with rituximab had clinical disease activity improvement \\[ 6 \\]. Patients were treated with either the lymphoma or RA dosing protocol for up to four cycles if needed to improve the clinical outcome or to treat relapses. 58 % (14/24) of patients reached the study endpoint: complete remission on no or minimal systemic therapy. There was no significant difference between the two protocols in achieving this end point. In addition, 46 % of patients (11/24) attained complete remission on no systemic therapy. Of note, the study examined an additional seven patients with PF and found similar results. The median relapse-free remission time of the combined PV and PF patients was 19 months. This study also found a significant decrease in the serum desmoglein index value (median change of −80 %) in ten paired serum samples of patients before and after therapy. Finally, the study found that treatment with rituximab earlier in the disease course yielded better outcomes. The median duration of disease prior to rituximab therapy was 19 months for patients who achieved complete remission on no or minimal systemic therapy compared to 86 months for patients who did not. The mechanism of incomplete remission and/or relapse in some PV patients treated with rituximab is unclear, but may be attributed to persistent B cells in the spleen or lymph nodes, or new bone marrow-derived B cells with novel immunoglobulin rearrangements \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【24】The most common side effects of rituximab treatment are mild, infusion-related events such as headache, fever, chills, nausea, pruritus, and hypotension that can be reduced with premedication. The most concerning adverse effect is serious and/or fatal infections \\[ 8 , 9 \\]. In a recent study of rituximab therapy in ANCA-associated vasculitides, severe infections occurred in 15 % (12/80) of patients and caused four deaths (5 %) \\[ 10 \\]. Late-onset infections are possible, occurring up to 85 months after the first rituximab dose, and up to 10 months after the last rituximab dose in a study of 17 patients with vasculitis followed for at least 3 years \\[ 11 \\]. It is unclear if the increased risk of infection is due to rituximab itself, secondary to a reduced number of B cells, or from the multiple immunosuppressive therapies that patients are often taking concurrently, particularly because some patients with normal IgG levels experienced serious infections \\[ 5 \\]. Patients with severe infections should not receive rituximab. Patients should be tested for tuberculosis and hepatitis prior to rituximab therapy, as well as receive immunizations such as pneumovax, if age appropriate.\n\n【25】Screening for hepatitis B virus (HBV) must include tests for both the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and the hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) prior to the initiation of treatment. In September 2013, the FDA issued a new Boxed Warning for rituximab following 109 cases of fatal HBV induced acute liver injury, including cases of HBV reactivation in patients with previously resolved HBV infections (HBsAg-, anti-HBc+, and hepatitis B surface antibody \\[anti-HBs\\]+) \\[ 12 \\]. Patients with prior HBV infection should be monitored for signs and symptoms of HBV reactivation both during and after the rituximab treatment by PCR for hepatitis B virus. If a patient experiences reactivation of HBV, an antiviral therapy should be initiated.\n\n【26】Other adverse events of rituximab therapy include: allergic infusion reactions, leukopenia, lymphopenia, neutropenia, and persistent hypogammaglobulinemia. Overall, rituximab is well tolerated and the side effects are moderate compared to the adverse effects of long-term, high-dose corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents. However, its use should be limited to severe, refractory PV because of the possible side effects.\n\n【27】### IVIG\n\n【28】The exact mechanism of action of IVIG in the treatment of PV is unclear. IVIG may have immunomodulatory actions on both B and T cell function, reduce serum levels of anti-desmoglein antibodies, and/or modify the function of the Fc receptor \\[ 13 , 14 \\]. The first randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial with IVIG in pemphigus was reported in 2009 \\[ 15 \\]. Twenty-one patients with PV and PF received 400 mg/kg/day of IVIG; 20 patients received 200 mg/kg/day of IVIG; and, 20 patients received placebo. Each patient group received five consecutive days of treatment with the assigned therapy. The time to escape from the protocol (the time until additional treatment was needed) was significantly prolonged for the 400 mg/kg/day group compared to the placebo group (P < 0.001), and a dose-response relationship in this outcome was observed among the three groups. There was no significant difference in adverse drug reactions among the three arms.\n\n【29】While the use of IVIG in PV has a corticosteroid sparing effect, \\[ 16 \\] IVIG should be used prudently due to its expense (often greater than $100,000 a year) and side effect profile. The most concerning adverse effect of IVIG is thrombotic events, such as stroke or myocardial infarction. No study has quantified the incidence of thrombotic events with IVIG therapy in PV. In the authors’ experience, the high incidence of thrombosis is concerning and requires caution, especially as PV patients may have anticardiolipin antibodies that already predispose them to thrombotic events. Further studies on the incidence of thrombosis during IVIG therapy are needed.\n\n【30】The most common side effect of IVIG is an infusion-related headache. Such headaches can be reduced with a slower infusion rate and acetaminophen. Other adverse effects of IVIG include: chills, hypotension, fever, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, infusion-site reactions, hemolysis, neutropenia, anaphylaxis in IgA deficiency, aseptic meningitis, and the potential to transfuse infectious agents.\n\n【31】### Rituximab and IVIG\n\n【32】IVIG may be added to rituximab therapy in PV to hasten disease resolution. IVIG may also provide protection from rituximab-induced hypogammaglobulinemia, and may therefore decrease the risk of infection with rituximab. However, infection with rituximab therapy may occur up to 18 months after treatment, \\[ 5 \\] which would not be prevented by combined rituximab and IVIG treatment early in PV therapy.\n\n【33】A study of 11 patients with PV refractory to conventional therapy or IVIG that were treated with a combination of IVIG and rituximab found that nine patients had rapid resolution of their clinical pemphigus disease activity lasting 22–37 months \\[ 17 \\]. All 11 patients were able to discontinue all additional immunosuppressive therapies before the end of the study. This study reported no clinically significant adverse effects, including no infections.\n\n【34】Key Points\n----------\n\n【35】*   Rituximab is the mainstay of treatment for patients with severe PV that is refractory to standard treatments. It produces complete remission in over 65 % of patients, and enables patients to reduce or discontinue toxic immunosuppressive therapies. Rituximab is more effective if used early in the course of PV.\n    \n*   IVIG may be used alone or in combination with rituximab to more quickly reduce disease activity, but should be reserved for patients with severe disease due to its high cost and risk of thrombotic events.\n", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

She has a history of hypertension， and an MI some 10 years ago. She reports no change in her health recently， and her functional capacity is excellent for her age. She is an avid gardener. As is custom at your institution， this patient did not visit the preoperative clinic. The ophthalmologist did provided a recent note from the patient's physician stating that her medical condi-tions were stable， and “clearing her for surgery.\"Her ECG and labora-tory tests from 3 months ago were attached to his note.\n\n【2】What is this patient's suitability for cataract surgery?\n\n【3】What are the most likely complications which may be observed during the case?\n\n【4】**What factors influence the need for sedation?**\n\n【5】ANSWERS TO CASE 49：\n\n【6】Summary： An 82-year-old patient with stable medical conditions presents for cataract surgery.\n\n【7】\\>Suitability for surgery： This patient is stable， followed by her primary physician， and ready to proceed with monitored anesthesia care (MAC) for her cataract surgery.\n\n【8】\\>Most common complications： During a case performed under MAC， there is always the danger that patients will move inappropriately. During eye pro-cedures， this is especially perilous because the procedure is performed using a microscope. The most likely medical events are hypertension， and an arrhythmia， usually bradycardia.\n\n【9】\\> Amount of sedation： The amount of sedation depends on the type of anes-thesia for the eye， topical anesthesia versus an eye block， as well as the method of removing the cataract.\n\n【10】**ANALYSIS**\n\n【11】**Objectives**\n\n【12】1\\. Understand how the preparation of patients having cataract surgery differs from other surgical procedures.\n\n【13】2\\. Become familiar with the anesthetic techniques used for cataract surgery and many eye procedures.\n\n【14】**Considerations**\n\n【15】Since this patient's medical condition is stable and she is followed by a primary physician， she is ready for cataract surgery. She does not need any additional medical testing prior to surgery， although it is helpful to have access to any tests which have been recently performed. In particular， a recent baseline ECG is helpful since arrhythmias may occur in eye surgery.\n\n【16】Once it is determined that the patient is ready for cataract surgery， a small intravenous is started， and standard monitors are placed. The need for seda-tion is determined by the type of anesthesia provided to the eye during the case. This patient’s cataract is suitable for PHACO extraction， and she is cooperative and able to lie still without the need for sedation. Thus， her sur-gery can be safely performed using topical anesthesia administered in the form of eye drops.\n\n【17】**APPROACH TO**\n\n【18】**DEFINITIONS**\n\n【19】MONITORED ANESTHESIA CARE (MAC)： The care of a patient by an anesthesiologist， during which time the patient is monitored， and sedative， hypnotic， opioid， or anxiolytic medications may be administered.\n\n【20】TOPICAL ANESTHESIA： Local anesthesia applied as drops or gels to the sur-face of the eye.\n\n【21】EYE BLOCK： Method of administering local anesthesia to the eye so as to block nerve conduction， both motor and sensory， to the eye.\n\n【22】RETROBULBAR BLOCK： Local anesthesia injected into the muscle cone behind the globe.\n\n【23】PERIBULBAR BLOCK： Local anesthesia injected outside the muscle cone.\n\n【24】SUB-TENONS BLOCK： Local anesthesia injected into the Tenons capsule below the surface of the globe.\n\n【25】**CLINICAL APPROACH**\n\n【26】Cataract extraction is the most common ssuurrggiiccaall procedure in the United States today. These procedures are done very quickly， and often， almost in an assembly line\" fashion. Since this type of surgery is so common， the costs of any associated care are multiplied many times over. In a study of over 18，000patients， Schein et al demonstrated that preoperative testing did not change outcomes in patients undergoing cataract surgery under MAC anesthesia. However， this study cohort was associated with one significant caveat： all of the study subjects were followed by a primary physician for their medical con-ditions， and had received testing for these conditions when appropriate. So unlike all other surgical procedures， patients followed by a primary physician may undergo cataract extraction without further preoperative evaluation.\n\n【27】COLIISP During the course of an eye operation， there are several reasons why a patient may benefit from the care of an anesthetist. The patient may be anx-ious， and require medication to calm or relax them so they can lie still for the procedure； he or she may need medication to treat pain or fright during the surgery； or the patient may experience arrhythmias， hypertension， or tachy-cardia necessitating a medical intervention.\n\n【28】It is imperative that the patient remain quiet， cooperative， and still dur-ing the procedure. In a recent review of closed malpractice insurance claims for MAC cases， 11% of claims involved injury due to movement or inade-quate anesthesia during eye surgery. Elderly patients， especially those with\n\n【29】medical conditions and ASA III or IV classification， made up a higher per-centage of the MAC claims， but were no different from the population as a whole receiving other types of anesthesia. Eye procedures may also pose some additional risk， since the patient is draped around the head and neck making detection of any impairment in respiratory movements difficult， or even a buildup of carbon dioxide may occur under the drapes， which is more difficult to detect. For this reason， when available， measurement of end-tidal CO，lev-els is desirable. Otherwise， standard monitors are all that are necessary for this type of case.\n\n【30】Most cataracts today are removed by PHACO emulsification. The cataract is broken into small pieces by ultrasound waves which are suctioned out through a cannula， requiring only very tiny incisions in the eye. The older technique of extracapsular cataract extraction removes the lens intact through a larger incision. The PHACO procedure is quicker and easier and allows more rapid recovery for the patient.\n\n【31】In many centers， cataract surgeries are now done under topical anesthesia， during which local anesthesia is administered via drops or gels to the surface of the eye. An additional intracameral injection of local anesthesia improves the quality of the anesthesia for the topicalized eye. The patient does not require sedation for the administration of topical anesthesia. However， the emulsification of the lens can cause images that may be frightening. Since the patient's vision is intact， they may see the bright light of the microscope and the surgeon's hands and instruments. They may also feel pain during place-ment of the speculum on the eyelids， iris manipulation， globe expansion by injection of solution into the eye， and introduction of the new lens. Since the patient's extra-ocular movements are intact， they need to be sufficiently awake to cooperate with the surgeon's instructions during the case.\n\n【32】Many older patients tolerate topical anesthesia for cataract surgery without any sedation. Education for the patient on what to expect during the proce-dure and careful patient selection results in greater success with topicalanes-thesia. After cataract surgery under topicalanesthesia， patients may have their vision restored immediately， since taping and protective shielding of the eye is not always necessary.\n\n【33】Eye blocks provide anesthesia， analgesia， and motor blockade to the eye. Eye blocks are administered in the operating room as with any regional block， or they may be placed prior to the patient coming into the OR in a holding area or block room where the patient can be sedated and monitored consis-tent with the same standards applied in the operating room. Although these blocks can be done without sedation， more commonly， the patient is sedated briefly for block placement， often with a small dose of propofol. This practice of doing the block ahead of time ensures that the patient is well recovered from any sedation prior to the start of surgery.\n\n【34】For a retrobulbar block， local anesthesia is injected through the skin of the lower eyelid at the inferior aspect of the orbit， and into the muscle cone behind the globe. Entrance into the muscle cone is confirmed by downward\n\n【35】movement of the eye， as the needle travels through the inferior rectus muscle. After a negative aspiration， a small amount of local anesthesia is injected， and travels along the nerves and blood vessels to block nerve transmission at the ciliary ganglion.\n\n【36】The peribulbar technique is similar， but requires a larger volume of local anesthesia and a longer time to work since the drug needs to diffuse further to reach the ganglion. To perform a peribulbar block， the local anesthetic is injected outside the muscle cone， inferior and/or superior to the globe. It is important that the patient does not move during the injection of an eye block due to the proximity of the needle to nerves and blood vessels， as well as to the globe itself.\n\n【37】The sub-Tenons eye block is typically performed by the surgeon after prep-ping and draping the eye. A small incision is made on the surface of the globe _1_ under local anesthesia， then a small blunt cannula is inserted into this space and local anesthesia travels to the retrobulbar space via Tenons capsule.\n\n【38】A patient's extra-ocular movements indicate the quality of all eye injection blocks. All blocks provide superior pain relief during and after cataract surgery as compared to topical anesthesia. Injection blocks prevent the occulo-cardiac reflex， which causes bradycardia during manipulation of the globe. Moi Major complications that may occur after injection blocks include retrobulbar hemorrhage， globe perforation， and brain stem anesthesia if the local anesthesia tracks back along the nerves all the way to their origin.\n\n【39】There are several drugs commonly used for sedation during cataract sur-gery. Midazolam， a short-acting benzodiazepine， is useful for patients undergo-ing either topical1anesthesia or injection blocks. It provides sedation， anxiolysis， and amnesia. A dose of 0.5 to 2 mg total should be administered slowly in elderly patients to avoid respiratory depression or over dosage. One must avoid oversedation since patient cooperation is necessary to prevent unintentional movement during surgery. Midazolam may cause prolonged psy-chomotor impairment in the elderly， especially those with pre-existing cogni-tive dysfunction.\n\n【40】Propofol， an induction agent， is used in smaller doses for sedation during administration of an eye block. The rapid onset and quick recovery profile allow the patient to be awake and cooperative prior to starting the surgery. Propofol can be administered in a dose from 0.3 to 1.0 mg/kg prior to the eye block. The patient will have sedation and amnesia for the eye block but little analgesia is expected. Movement during the block is frequent and sneezing may also occur. This technique is useful for the patient who wants to be “asleep\" for the block.\n\n【41】Remifentanil， an opioid agonist， is the newest drug frequently adminis-tered to eye surgery patients. This drug displays both fast onset and rapid clearance by the plasma via ester hydrolysis. Given in a dose of 0.3 to 0.5 mcg/kg the patient feels no pain for the injection block. However， respiratory depression and chest wall rigidity can occur when remifentanil is bolused quickly. Also， like any other opiate， remifentanil is not a hypnotic， so patients frequently have recall for the block. Nausea and vomiting may occur， although rarely.\n\n【42】Sedative drugs are often used in combination. However， in the elderly these combinations may result in exaggerated sedation or respiratory depression. The Study of Medical Testing for Cataract Surgery found infrequent adverse med-ical events during cataract surgery in their study population. However， the administration of a combination of drugs increased the odds ratio for an event significantly. The use of a short-acting hypnotic (such as propofol)， combined with an opiate， a sedative， or both elevated the odds ratio for an adverse event from a low of 9.8 with a hypnotic alone to as high as 30.7 for a combination of all three categories. Fortunately， they did not identify any anesthetic regimen that increased the risk of death or unexpected hospitalization.\n\n【43】Patient satisfaction following eye surgery has been associated with spe-cific factors such as surgeon skill and the length of operation. However， there is no evidence that any particular class of sedative or anesthetic improves satisfaction.\n\n【44】The postoperative course for the cataract surgery patient most often is very short and uneventful. The patients usually meet discharge criteria prior to leaving the OR， so it is customary for cataract patients to go directly to a phase 2 or step down unit rather than the main PACU. Since the injection block usually lasts much longer than the procedure， vision is limited and so the patient is instructed to wear an eye shield to protect the eye from injury. Significant postoperative pain is an unusual event. Pain in the cataract sur-gery patient that is unrelieved with an over-the-counter strength analgesic such as acetaminophen should be considered unusual and that patient should be seen by a physician. If nausea or vomiting occurs， they should be treated aggressively as both retching and vomiting can increase intra-ocular pressure and jeopardize the closure of the incisions.\n", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Her husband, her main carer, was admitted yesterday with pneumonia. He men￾tioned to staff that his wife was at home alone and was concerned she might not be managing \n\n【3】without him.\n\n【4】After she failed to answer the staff’s phone calls, an ambulance was dispatched, and she was \n\n【5】found in her chair, dehydrated and unable to mobilise. Since her husband’s admission she \n\n【6】had been too weak and breathless to get up, and had been unable to get herself anything to \n\n【7】eat or drink.\n\n【8】Fortunately her test results are normal and the A&E doctor suggests she stays overnight \n\n【9】so a carer can be arranged the following morning. The doctor explains to Nora they are \n\n【10】concerned that if she goes home she may become dehydrated or have a fall. Nora is adamant \n\n【11】she wants to go home, stating that she is fine, would rather sleep in her own bed, and will take \n\n【12】a sandwich from A&E for supper. She starts getting up and making her way towards the door. \n\n【13】She has no history of mental health problems.\n\n【14】Questions\n\n【15】• How should doctors approach patients who make decisions they consider unwise?\n\n【16】• What issues arise from the complex interplay between health and social care, \n\n【17】particularly during out of hours?234\n\n【18】100 Cases in Clinical Ethics and Law\n\n【19】ANSWER 83\n\n【20】The fact that Nora’s decision to go home is one the doctor might think is unwise is not grounds \n\n【21】for overriding her decision, as all adults should be assumed to have capacity unless it is dem￾onstrated otherwise. The Mental Capacity Act Code of Practice states that ‘anybody who claims \n\n【22】that an individual lacks capacity should be able to provide proof. They need to be able to show, \n\n【23】on the balance of probabilities, that the individual lacks capacity to make a particular decision, at \n\n【24】the time it needs to be made’ (paragraph 4.10). The doctor should formally assess Nora’s capac￾ity (particularly given that she is making a decision which could potentially result in harm), \n\n【25】and explore the reasons behind Nora’s decision. It may be that Nora attributes different weight \n\n【26】to the risks and benefits compared with the doctor, and that she is willing to accept the risk of \n\n【27】a fall or becoming unwell in exchange for the benefit she perceives of being in her own home.\n\n【28】If Nora is deemed to have capacity, her decision must be respected and she must be allowed to go \n\n【29】home. In this scenario, the doctor will probably feel uneasy. Doctors have a duty of care towards \n\n【30】their patients, and it may be difficult for the doctor to reconcile this duty to look after Nora and \n\n【31】avoid harm, with the requirement to respect her autonomous decision. This uneasiness could \n\n【32】be partly addressed by considering what measures they could take to try to support Nora and \n\n【33】respect her wishes whilst reducing potential risks. As it is out of hours and she is in A&E it may \n\n【34】be practically difficult to arrange additional care, although some areas have emergency social \n\n【35】care services and district nurses. The doctor may consider contacting out of hours support net￾works, informing Nora’s GP of the situation, or calling her in the morning to check her progress.\n\n【36】If there was anything to suggest that Nora lacks capacity, a different set of challenges arise. If a \n\n【37】patient lacks capacity they should be treated according to their best interests, but these can be \n\n【38】difficult to determine as they extend beyond only medical issues. One may argue that keeping \n\n【39】Nora in hospital is in her best interests as it will prevent potential harm, preserving her future \n\n【40】autonomy. However, keeping her in hospital against her will, particularly where there is no \n\n【41】medical treatment indicated and where doing so is purely a preventative measure to reduce \n\n【42】risk of potential (not definite) harm, is a significant infringement of her autonomy. This could \n\n【43】amount to a deprivation of her liberty (Case 33), contravening Article 5 (right to liberty) and \n\n【44】Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life) of the ECHR. Furthermore, keeping Nora \n\n【45】in hospital against her will could result in further harm, as she may be less willing to engage \n\n【46】with health and social services in the future, something that is likely to become increasingly \n\n【47】important given her current health status and her husband’s role as her sole carer.\n\n【48】This case demonstrates that assessing capacity, and subsequent decision-making, can be \n\n【49】complex, particularly in environments such as A&E where things are busy, time-pressured, \n\n【50】and the doctor may lack any prior knowledge of the patient. It may be further complicated \n\n【51】where a patient makes a decision the doctor considers unwise, because although this does not \n\n【52】necessarily indicate a lack of capacity, it will cause unease for the doctor. However, when a \n\n【53】patient has capacity their autonomous wishes should be respected, and doctors should seek \n\n【54】to explore potential practical methods and utilise other healthcare and social professionals to \n\n【55】enable their wishes to be met.\n\n【56】Key Points\n\n【57】• Assessing capacity may be difficult in certain circumstances, particularly where there \n\n【58】are time-pressures in busy departments and a lack of prior knowledge of the patient.\n\n【59】• Senior support should be sought if there are doubts about a patient’s capacity, \n\n【60】particularly where they are making a decision that may put them at risk.235\n\n【61】Duties of a Doctor\n\n【62】", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

She has a history of gastroenteritis five weeks before presentation. She is bradycardic, tachypneic, and hypotensive. The neurologic examination is significant for areflexia, paralysis of her legs with sensory deficits, severe weakness of her arms, and some difficulty swallowing and breathing.

Know a diagnostic approach to Guillain-Barré syndrome including historical clues and examination findings, and understand the differential diagnosis.\n\n【14】2\\. Understand that addressing respiratory failure should be the first priority in treating acute weakness caused by Guillain-Barré syndrome.\n\n【15】3\\. Be familiar with a rational workup for Guillain-Barré syndrome, and know the subtypes including the Miller-Fisher variant.\n\n【16】##### _Considerations_\n\n【17】This 25-year-old woman developed acute symmetric ascending paralysis with progressive involvement of diaphragmatic muscles. Her most immediate problem is impending respiratory failure. The first priority should be to determine the progression of respiratory insufficiency , usually by serially measuring FVC. The negative inspiratory force should also be followed. Oxygen desaturation occurs much too late to be a safe indicator. An FVC less than 15 mL/kg to 20 mL/kg or maximum inspiratory pressure less than 30 cm H <sub class=\"calibre12\">2 </sub> O usually signals imminent need for intubation and mechanical ventilation. After determining the need for intubation, the next priority is to determine the etiology of the weakness. Guillain-Barré syndrome is the most common cause of acute flaccid paralysis in the United States , occurring in 1 to 3 out of every 100,000 people with a bimodal distribution affecting patients 15 to 35 years of age and 50 to 75 years of age. This patient has the classic history of a bacterial or viral gastrointestinal illness 2 to 4 weeks prior to onset of paresthesia and weakness. She possibly had been exposed to poorly cooked meat, which predisposes her to _Campylobacter jejuni_ . Forty percent of Guillain-Barré patients have positive _C jejuni_ serum antibodies and/or stool cultures. Areflexia is a hallmark examination finding, particularly in conjunction with proximal lower extremity weakness with distal sensory changes and ascending progression. Diaphragmatic and cranial nerve muscles can be affected as well, with up to one-third of patients requiring intubation, as well as autonomic involvement causing bradycardia and hypotension.\n\n【18】### APPROACH TO: Acute Weakness\n\n【19】#### DEFINITIONS\n\n【20】ACUTE WEAKNESS: Ascends from legs to arms and cranial nerves over hours to days.\n\n【21】INFLAMMATORY: Autoimmune humoral and cell-mediated response to recent infection capable of molecular mimicry to stimulate production of antiganglioside antibodies against surface molecules of peripheral nerves.\n\n【22】DEMYELINATING: Immune-mediated damage to myelin surrounding the peripheral nerves, spinal roots, and cranial nerves resulting in clinical weakness and numbness, and electromyographic evidence of profoundly delayed or absent nerve conduction velocities.\n\n【23】POLYNEUROPATHY: Symmetric damage to peripheral nerves in multiple extremities.\n\n【24】FLACCID: Lower motor neuron weakness with hypo- or areflexia, hypotonia, and, in the case of chronic disease, muscle atrophy.\n\n【25】#### CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【26】Acute motor weakness can be associated with conditions affecting all levels of the nervous system. However, the pattern of weakness, presence of other signs (sensory loss, incoordination, altered mental status), and degree of hypo- or hyperreflexia helps to distinguish the anatomic site of disease.\n\n【27】Disorders of the brain that cause acute weakness include acute stroke, space-occupying lesion, or an inflammatory or infectious cause. Often these conditions affect multiple pathways resulting in not only motor weakness, but sensory changes, speech changes, and altered mental status. In this case, the patient presented with a rapidly ascending, bilateral weakness and respiratory weakness, in the absence of speech changes. Her reflexes were absent, and her level of consciousness is intact. Therefore, it is unlikely that her condition is caused by disease of the brain. Furthermore, CNS disease is association with increased reflexes and rarely affects both sides of the brain that would result in bilateral weakness without a significant change in mental status and level of consciousness. The exception to this is spinal cord disease, which can result in symmetric weakness and sensory loss that can ascend from the legs, depending on the condition. Therefore, it is often worthwhile to image the spinal cord in such clinical presentations. In this case, the patient’s spinal cord was normal. Therefore, the presentation is most consistent with a condition of the peripheral nervous system.\n\n【28】The peripheral nervous system (PNS) is made up of the nerve root, peripheral nerve, nerve–muscle junction, and muscle. Myopathies of various etiologies often present with a subacute or chronic course associated with proximal muscle weakness, which typically does not ascend. Although muscle diseases such as inflammatory myopathies, muscular dystrophies, and metabolic myopathies can be associated with respiratory impairment, the sensory and autonomic systems are not affected.\n\n【29】Nerve–muscle junctional disorders such as myasthenia gravis can present with acute and subacute motor weakness that fatigues with repetitive activity. However, the examination in this case did not reveal impairment or fatigue of the neuromuscular junction.\n\n【30】In this case, the acute onset of a flaccid ascending, symmetric weakness and presence of autonomic dysfunction is most consistent with an acute polyneuropathy. The etiologies of acute or subacute polyneuropathy is not extensive. In an otherwise healthy young girl, the presentation is most consistent with acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) or Guillain-Barré syndrome.\n\n【31】Guillain-Barré syndrome can be associated with _C jejuni_ as well as other bacterial etiologies including _Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae_ , and _Borrelia burgdorferi_ , and viral etiologies such as HIV, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Postvaccination disease, especially influenza, has been reported, as well as rare cases associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis, lymphoma, postpregnancy, and certain medications. There are five major subtypes of Guillain-Barré syndrome, the most common by far being AIDP. The Miller-Fisher variant presents with the textbook triad of areflexia, ataxia (out of proportion to sensory deficits), and ophthalmoplegia, predominant cranial nerve weakness rather than extremities, and positive anti-GQ1b (ganglioside) antibodies. Acute motor-axonal neuropathy (AMAN) is purely motor and affects mostly children, with greater than 70% being seropositive for _C jejuni_ . It usually carries a better prognosis for recovery. Acute motor-sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN) affects more adults, with significant muscle atrophy and poor recovery. Acute panautonomic neuropathy is the rarest subtype with mortality from cardiovascular involvement and dysrhythmias. The differential diagnosis for acute flaccid paralysis with gastrointestinal symptoms includes two very important etiologies that carry high morbidity but, if identified and treated quickly, can be reversed: botulism and tick paralysis. Botulism is caused by the _Clostridium botulinum_ neurotoxin, the most lethal toxin known to man, and is frequently food borne but can also present with intravenous drug use, surgery, and wounds. The difference is that patients often present with a descending paralysis, beginning with the Dozen Ds of progression—dry mouth, double vision, pupil dilation, droopy eyelids, facial droop, diminished gag reflex, dysphagia, dysarthria, dysphonia, difficulty lifting head, descending paralysis, and diaphragmatic paralysis. Rapid administration of botulism antitoxin halts worsening, although mechanical ventilation can still be required.\n\n【32】Tick paralysis produces a rapidly ascending paralysis with areflexia, ataxia, and respiratory insufficiency much like Guillain-Barré syndrome, particularly in children with a history of outdoor exposure. Removal of the discovered female tick can be curative by elimination of the source of the neurotoxin.\n\n【33】#### CLINICAL PRESENTATION\n\n【34】The mean interval from onset of Guillain-Barré syndrome to the most severe degree of impairment is 12 days, with 98% of patients reaching the end point of clinical worsening (nadir) by 4 weeks. The mean time to improvement starts at 28 days, and clinical recovery usually occurs by 200 days. Eighty-five percent of patients recover completely, although up to 15% have permanent deficits. Three to eight percent of patients die in spite of intensive care management. A major cause of mortality in elderly victims is arrhythmias.\n\n【35】The history should be meticulous to identify corroborating symptomatology and triggers as discussed above, and to rule out other causes of acute flaccid paralysis. The physical examination should focus on the vital signs, reflexes, and extent of weakness in the extremities, diaphragm, and cranial nerves. Fever and mental status changes are unusual, and signal hypoxic respiratory failure or a different etiology. The principal laboratory test is the lumbar puncture showing rising protein levels up to 400 mg/L with no associated increase in cell count ( _albuminocytologic dissociation_ ), although protein elevation may not be seen until 1 to 2 weeks after onset, and 10% remain normal. Antibodies and stool culture for _C jejuni_ are frequently checked. Other helpful tests include sedimentation rate, antiganglioside antibodies, anti-GQ1b antibodies for Miller-Fisher presentations, and pregnancy test. Presence of anti-GM1 antibodies signals a poorer prognosis. Nerve conduction studies show early changes indicative of nerve root demyelination. MRI of the brain and spine can show anterior nerve root enhancement, which is more specific for Guillain-Barré syndrome, but should be obtained for difficult cases to rule out secondary causes, such as malignancy, vasculitic, or viral infection, and spinal cord pathology. Measurement of respiratory strength (FVC) is crucial for cases with respiratory involvement as above. Electrocardiograph (ECG) should be performed to screen for atrioventricular block, ST segment changes, and arrhythmias.\n\n【36】The patient should be admitted for further monitoring and treatment. If the etiology is still unclear and the patient continues to deteriorate, consultation with a neurologist is indicated.\n\n【37】#### TREATMENT\n\n【38】Intubation and mechanical ventilation should be considered for FVC less than 15 mL/kg with intensive care monitoring for arrhythmias and blood pressure instability . Because of the immune-mediated pathogenesis of the disease, the only proven therapies are IV immune globulin therapy and plasma exchange, both of which can hasten recovery by 50% if initiated early in the course of the disease. There is no data to support the use of steroids. Complications of immobility, hospitalization, and respiratory insufficiency should be avoided by implementing prophylactic measures for deep venous thrombosis, decubitus ulcers, gastritis, and aspiration. Recurrence is rare but can occur in up to 5% of cases.\n\n【39】#### ", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}
