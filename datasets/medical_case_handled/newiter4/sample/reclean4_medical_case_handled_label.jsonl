The combination of aspirin and lisinopril has not been shown to cause acute kidney injury； a creatinine level of 0.2 mg/ dL above baseline levels does not confer acute kidney injury. Moderate proteinuria and a mild elevation in serum creatinine do not consti-tute postrenal azotemia and proteinuria due to BPH in this patient.\n\n【17】52.2 B.

The inhibition of de novo cholesterol synthesis results in reduced intrahepatic cholesterol concentrations, which then stimulates hepatocytes to upregulate surface LDL cholesterol receptors. This facilitates the clearance of LDL cholesterol from the circulation. In addition, circulated LDL cholesterol precursors, including VLDL cholesterol remnants, are cleared more rapidly from circulation because of their cross-recognition with hepatic LDL cholesterol receptors.  \nAnswer A is incorrect . Although statins decrease hepatic synthesis of cholesterol, they have no direct effect on LDL cholesterol production.  \nAnswer B is incorrect . Statins only mildly reduce the plasma concentrations of triglycerides.  \nAnswer C is incorrect . Statins cause upregulation, not downregulation, of surface LDL cholesterol receptors.  \nAnswer D is incorrect . Statins do not directly increase HDL cholesterol production.

What anticipatory guidance should be given to the parents?Rationale and Evidence‐based Practice Explanation\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【13】### Based on the data given, what is the differential diagnosis and the most likely diagnosis for this child?\n\n【14】The differential diagnoses for this child include viral bronchiolitis, viral or bacterial pneumonia, pertussis, and reactive airway disease.\n\n【15】删除3：<u>Figure 5.1 Anteroposterior (AP) chest radiograph.</u>\n\n【16】删除3：<u>Figure 5.2 Lateral chest radiograph.</u>\n\n【17】The most likely diagnosis for this child is viral bronchiolitis due to the infant’s history and presenting symptoms of rhinorrhea, congestion, cough, fever, and tachypnea. Bronchiolitis is a leading cause of illness in the first year of life and is often caused by respiratory syncytial virus, although other viruses such as human metapneumovirus and rhinovirus can be the offending pathogen. Most children tolerate bronchiolitis and can be managed as outpatients with supportive measures; however, it remains a leading cause of hospitalization in infants.\n\n【18】Infants are obligatory nose breathers and find it difficult to clear their nasal airways without assistance. A cardinal manifestation of bronchiolitis in infants is copious and tenacious airway mucus.\n\n【19】### What is the best way to increase this infant’s oxygenation and how would you order this?\n\n【20】The best way to increase oxygenation in an infant with bronchiolitis is non‐invasive nasal suctioning for airway clearance. Infants are obligate nose breathers and have difficulty clearing their nasal airway of the copious thick mucus of bronchiolitis without assistance. The use of normal saline during suctioning should be considered to facilitate airway clearance. Deeper suctioning may be required; however, it can lead to trauma and increased airway edema which can further occlude the upper airways.\n\n【21】Guidelines suggest that supplemental oxygen does not need to be administered unless the saturation is less than 90%. If this decision is made, there are many methods to deliver oxygen. In some cases, non‐invasive positive pressure ventilation or high‐flow nasal cannula may decrease the patient’s work of breathing.\n\n【22】### Would you consider albuterol at the same time?\n\n【23】Guidelines include strong recommendations against the use of bronchodilators in infants with wheezing in the setting of bronchiolitis. Given this patient has no history of wheezing, the likelihood of improving his symptoms with albuterol are minimal. In addition, the likelihood of side effects including tachycardia are not insignificant.\n\n【24】### How would you determine if the therapy was effective?\n\n【25】Frequent physical examinations are recommended. Determination of improvement is based on clinical signs and symptoms of decreasing respiratory distress. These include normalization of respiratory rate and heart rate, and decreasing retractions, nasal flaring and head bobbing\n\n【26】### Would you obtain any other diagnostic studies?\n\n【27】The diagnosis of bronchiolitis is based on physical examination and history. Routine radiographic and laboratory testing should not be performed. However, if there is suspicion of another process, they should be explored in a targeted manner. Infants under 12 weeks of age with a history of prematurity, cardiopulmonary disease or immunodeficiency concerns place the child at higher risk for increased severity of illness and require further exploration of potential causes of the symptoms.\n\n【28】The young age of this patient prompted the original chest X‐ray, showing no focal abnormalities and an expected heart size.\n\n【29】Electrolyte and complete blood count testing may be considered, but usually do not provide diagnostic or management assistance in the setting of viral bronchiolitis.\n\n【30】Viral testing is unlikely to assist in the clinical care and management of the patient. However, it may provide an explanation of the symptoms and assist with the cohorting of patients in the inpatient setting. In the case of the presenting patient, respiratory syncytial virus was detected on the rapid respiratory panel.\n\n【31】### What other therapies would be recommended?\n\n【32】Ensure the infant is appropriately hydrated. Given his recent post‐tussive vomiting, insensible fluid losses in respiratory distress, and the likelihood that he has had a decreased oral intake prior to presentation, an assessment of his fluid status should be completed. Even slight dehydration can lead to increased tenacity of the airway secretions, potentially further occluding his airway.\n\n【33】Antipyretic administration may decrease the respiratory and heart rates and help to improve the overall symptoms.\n\n【34】Antimicrobials are not recommended unless there is evidence or a strong suspicion of a concomitant bacterial infection. Other therapies not recommended include chest physiotherapy and systemic corticosteroids.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

In addition to  删除换行1 establishing a diagnosis and ruling out any underlying medical disorders, the priorities  删除换行1 for this patient are pain relief and prevention of infection. Pain relief would include  删除换行1 simple measures such as reducing friction to eroded areas of the skin (with easy-release  删除换行1 dressings and/or greasy emollients) and minimizing activity, as well as pharmacological  删除换行1 pain relief. Preventing infection can be challenging: barrier nursing and use of topical  删除换行1 antiseptics such as potassium permanganate, triclosan and chlorhexidine, particularly  删除换行1 when washing, are frequently advocated.\n\n【23】The age of the patient, her history and presentation, and eosinophilia are highly suggestive of a diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid. Other autoimmune bullous diseases could  删除换行1 be considered in the differential diagnosis, in particular: inflammatory epidermolysis  删除换行1 bullosa acquisita (a mucous membrane pemphigoid, which often has a more insidious  删除换行1 onset with more mucosal involvement than skin); erythema multiforme major (usually  删除换行1 more haemorrhagic mucosal involvement and targetoid lesions); and bullous vasculitis \n\n【24】(usually purpuric skin lesions in association with blistering, especially of the lower  删除换行1 extremities). Occasionally bullous pemphigoid can be associated with underlying  删除换行1 conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease or occult malignancy or be provoked  删除换行1 by medication (e.g. furosemide, ACE inhibitors, and recently anti-TNF monoclonal  删除换行1 antibody therapy).\n\n【25】Bullous pemphigoid is characterized by circulating and tissue-bound pathogenic  删除换行1 anti-cutaneous basement membrane zone antibodies. These can be detected by  删除换行1 immunofluorescence studies (on skin and  删除换行1 serum). Figure 28.2 demonstrates positive green fluorescence of tissue-bound  删除换行1 antibodies along the cutaneous basement  删除换行1 membrane. Immunosuppression with systemic corticosteroids and steroid-sparing  删除换行1 agents is the cornerstone of treatment;  删除换行1 although for patients with milder or more  删除换行1 localized disease superpotent topical corticosteroids alone may be sufficient to  删除换行1 achieve disease control.

Calcium is maintained in high concentrations outside of the cell and in discrete compartments within the cell (eg, in mitochondria). Free intracellular calcium can activate several enzymes the cumulative effect of which is to induce significant cell injury. A few important enzyme classes include ATPases, which decrease the ATP supply; phospholipases, which decrease membrane stability; endonucleases, which induce DNA damage; and several proteases, responsible for protein breakdown.  \nAnswer B is incorrect. Free radical generation is a common mechanism of cell injury, but calcium excess does not induce free radical generation.  \nAnswer C is incorrect. Activation of proteases and phospholipases induces the breakdown of necessary components of cell membranes.  \nAnswer D is incorrect. ATP depletion, resulting from the activation of ATPases, can contribute to the inhibition of glycolysis.  \nAnswer E is incorrect. Inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation is an effect of ATP depletion caused by enzyme activation. Although this may contribute to cell damage, it is not the best answer. The enzyme activation resulting from calcium excess is the root cause of the cell damage, and thus would be the primary insult responsible for the majority of cell damage.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

By the end of the session, she appeared quite at ease and was smiling broadly. Molly was instructed not to wash her hands or use hand sanitizer for at least an hour following the exposure exercise and not to change her clothes when she arrived home. She was also instructed that if she did wash or use sanitizer, she must recontaminate her hands by touching a light switch. Molly’s homework was to touch light switches in her home and not to wash her hands after doing so and to spread the contamination on her clothing and personal items, including her bed.\n\n【1】Molly’s mother was not present for the majority of the session, but attended the last 5 min of the session in order to be updated on Molly’s progress and to be informed of Molly’s homework assignment. Molly’s therapist asked Molly to describe to her mother the goals that were accomplished during the therapy session, and Molly shyly but enthusiastically told her mother of her success in touching light switches. Molly’s mother’s response was “That’s great but you have a really long way to go.” Molly’s excitement deflated instantly. She began looking down at her hands and simply nodded in response to this comment.\n\n【2】Molly’s therapist immediately stated that Molly’s success in the initial exposure exercise was a huge step towards tackling OCD and that she had confidence that Molly would continue to beat OCD in subsequent sessions. Molly’s therapist continued to praise Molly about her participation in exposure exercises and suggested that Molly’s mother could help to support her daughter by praising Molly for her successes.\n\n【3】Molly was successful in completing her homework assignment, and during the next session she appeared happy that she had conquered one of her fears so early in therapy. Molly’s therapist continued to be enthusiastic and to provide Molly with high levels of positive feedback during and after exposure exercises in order to motivate Molly and to combat Molly’s depressive style.\n\n【4】The next exposure exercise involved touching the arms of an infrequently used chair in the therapist’s office using Molly’s fingertips and eventually using her entire hand. Molly was also able to touch the arms of a more frequently used chair in the therapist’s office and eventually to touch the arms of the chairs in the waiting room. Molly’s anxiety became quite elevated during the exposure exercise, but she was able to tolerate the anxiety and eventually habituated to it. For homework, Molly was asked to touch the chair arms at her local library, coffee shops, and other public places, and she was instructed not to wash her hands or use sanitizer for at least an hour after engaging in the exposure exercise. Again, she was instructed to recontaminate after washing her hands. Molly’s mother agreed to drive her to public places so she could engage in the homework exposure exercises.\n\n【5】Molly was successful in completing her homework exposure exercises and reported that despite not having engaged in a formal exposure exercise to touching car door handles, she was no longer experiencing anxiety regarding this. She and her therapist conducted an exposure exercise to verify this and Molly’s anxiety did not become significantly elevated.\n\n【6】Subsequent exposure exercises involved touching the therapist’s office door knob, door knobs to other offices in the suite, the doorknob to the public restroom, touching Molly’s backpack (which had touched the floor), and touching the tops of Molly’s shoes. Molly was able to complete each of these exposure tasks and to tolerate the related anxiety without needing to wash her hands.\n\n【7】Eventually, Molly and her therapist conducted an exposure exercise to touching the sink and floor in the public restroom in the therapist’s suite. Molly experienced extremely elevated anxiety during these exposure exercises but completed the exposure exercises nonetheless. Molly’s biggest fear was that she would make a family member or friend sick due to spreading contamination. Throughout the course of therapy, none of Molly’s family members became sick; however, Molly’s therapist came down with a cold in the week after the bathroom floor exposure, and Molly’s therapist was so sick that she needed to cancel the following week’s session.\n\n【8】During the next session, Molly appeared quite anxious and fearful and would barely make eye contact with her therapist. She reported that she attributed the therapist’s illness to the bathroom exposure that they had done a few days before the therapist became ill. Molly said that she had been wracked with guilt and that she believed that it was her fault that her therapist had become sick. She reported that she had been washing and sanitizing her hands frequently throughout the week and was terrified that she would make one of her family members sick. She also reported that she had been changing her clothes frequently in order to avoid others becoming ill. In short, her ritualizing, which had been drastically reduced prior to the therapist becoming ill, had returned to pre-therapy levels.\n\n【9】Despite the return of Molly’s symptoms, the therapist becoming ill was a fortuitous event because it provided the therapist with the opportunity to delve deeper into Molly’s feared consequence. Molly had reported that she was afraid that she would spread germs by touching contaminated items and would make others sick; however, she had not been able to elucidate the feared consequence if someone did become sick—death, serious illness, discomfort. After much discussion, Molly realized that her core fear was that others would die if they became ill due to her spreading germs. The therapist becoming sick and experiencing only a week of discomfort served as evidence that her core fear was inaccurate. It was discussed that the therapist could very well become ill again in the future, and that Molly and her family members would likely catch viruses in the future, but that usually the worst that would happen is simply a brief period of discomfort. Molly appeared relieved once this was discussed, and she recognized that her feared consequence had not occurred. Thus, the therapist’s illness was a corrective emotional experience for Molly.\n\n【10】Molly’s ritualizing returned to a relatively low level, and she and the therapist continued to work on exposure to items on her hierarchy. The next item on her hierarchy involved touching the bottom of her shoe. Molly’s therapist modeled this exposure for Molly and then repeated the exposure along with Molly. Molly experienced an extreme increase in her anxiety upon doing this exposure but was able to tolerate the anxiety without washing her hands and to spread the contamination to her hair, face, and belongings. At this point, Molly had completed 16 sessions of therapy, and there were only a few items remaining on the hierarchy.\n\n【11】During the following session, Molly was supposed to touch the bottom of her shoe and then lick her hand. Molly’s mother was informed that this was the hierarchy item on the agenda for the day, and she immediately reported that she was revolted by the idea and did not understand why this would be therapeutic. The therapist reviewed the idea that the goal of ERP is to fully expose the individual to their fears and to ensure that the individual does not attribute a lack of feared consequences to avoidance.\n\n【12】It was explained that, at times, this required an individual with OCD to engage in behaviors that go beyond what most people would do 删除10：<u>(Gillihan et al. 2012 )</u>. For example, if a person fears contamination by germs, touching the bottom of one’s shoe and then licking one’s hand or even licking the bottom of one’s shoe may expose the individual to the highest level of germs imaginable. This could help the individual to most effectively habituate to the anxiety caused by contamination and germs, and also teach the individual that their feared consequences (dying, contracting a serious illness, etc.) do not occur. Although most people do not lick the bottom of their shoe or touch the bottom of their shoe and then lick their hand, it is a common experience for people to adjust their shoe or tie their shoe (touching the sole of their shoe in the process) and then eat without washing their hands. People may also touch the bottom of their shoe to their furniture or clothing when crossing their legs or propping their feet up on a coffee table and later eat after touching the furniture of clothing that has come into contact with the shoe sole. Most people do not even notice that they have done this.\n\n【13】Similarly, it is sometimes necessary to eat off of the floor to fully expose an individual with contamination-related OCD to their feared consequences. Although most people do not eat off of the floor on a regular basis, children drop food on the floor and eat it frequently, and some restaurant workers will serve food after it has fallen on the floor. So, it is likely that most individuals have eaten food that touched the floor at some point in their life, and few have become seriously ill or died from this. Thus, although these exposures go beyond what most people deliberately do on a daily basis, they do expose individuals to their most feared consequence and do not put clients at risk beyond the risk experienced by most people who do not have OCD.\n\n【14】If an individual with OCD does avoid an item at the top of the hierarchy, they may attribute the lack of a feared consequence as being the result of avoidance. For example, if an individual fears contracting a terrible illness by being contaminated by dirt on the bottom of one’s shoes and the person does not touch the bottom of their shoe, they may attribute their lack of illness as being due to avoidance of the bottom of their shoe. Later, the person may start to avoid items that their shoes have come into contact with—socks, pant legs, furniture, etc. Then the contamination may spread from these items to adjacent items, shirts, hands, coats. The contaminated items may continue to grow, and the items that may be touched without consequence will continue to reduce until the individual’s OCD is guiding their life. Thus, it is essential for clients to engage in exposures to the top items on their hierarchy to fully extinguish the fear.\n\n【15】Such an explanation was provided to Molly and her mother, however, Molly’s mother continued to report disgust, and she even went so far as to say that she did not even want to be near her child if her child were to engage in such an exposure. Although Molly had previously been compliant with all therapy requests, she reported that she did not want to complete this exposure exercise. The therapist attempted to find ways to introduce the exposure in a more gradual manner (touching her shoe sole, then touching her hand to another item, and licking that item or touching her shoe sole with her fingertip and then licking her fingertip), but Molly continued to refuse to engage in the exposure. Molly’s therapist asked her if she would be willing to eat off of the floor instead, and Molly’s mother again expressed revulsion at the idea. When the therapist explained the idea that children often eat off of the floor, Molly’s mother reported that no child of hers had ever eaten anything off of the floor and that she ensured that her home floor was extremely clean (unlike the floor of the therapist’s office), but she still would not permit her children to eat off of her home floor. At this point, the therapy was at an impasse. Several sessions were spent discussing the idea of licking her hand after touching her shoe and eating off of the floor, but Molly’s mother continued to express disgust and Molly continued to refuse to engage in the exposure exercises.\n\n【16】The therapist had no choice but to work on relapse prevention and to continue to bring up the topic of the incomplete items on the hierarchy and risk for relapse because the fear had not entirely been extinguished. During relapse prevention, Molly was able to indicate that she would conduct exposure exercises if OCD symptoms began to return or if new symptoms emerged. She had guided the last several completed exposures on her own and appeared to understand the process of engaging in exposures independently. She also reported understanding the importance of contaminating herself after washing her hands and spreading contamination to all of her belongings so she could begin to avoid certain items that she felt were contaminated.\n\n【17】After 24 sessions, therapy was terminated with the promise that the family would call the therapist for a booster session if necessary. At post-therapy Molly’s OCD symptoms had reduced to a 9 on the CY-BOCS, and she was no longer suffering from depression or extreme social anxiety. She appeared happier, more carefree, and more confident. Additionally, her family conflict had been dramatically reduced, and she reported that she was getting along much better with her siblings.\n\n【18】Three months later, Molly called the therapist reporting that her OCD symptoms had returned, and she requested a booster session. She reported that she was washing her hands several times a day and spent 30–40 min washing her hands each time. She was also showering when she returned home at the end of the day and changing her clothes several times a day. Her concerns about her backpack contaminating items had returned as well. Molly was tearful during the phone call, and stated that she was disappointed that she had relapsed and knew that she had disappointed her family.\n\n【19】During Molly’s booster session, she reported that her OCD fears had gradually begun to creep back in and that she had attempted to conduct ERP but had been unable to do so on her own. She stated that her mother had been less negative and critical of her as of late, but that now that her symptoms had returned, her mother was expressing disappointment in her. Molly’s mother reported that she had noticed that Molly’s OCD symptoms were returning, but said that she was unaware that they had become so severe. She said that she “wasn’t surprised that the talk therapy hadn’t really worked given that medication hadn’t worked” but was willing to give it one more try.\n\n【20】A new hierarchy was created (based on Molly’s old hierarchy and her report of her current symptoms). Molly was quickly able to complete exposures to her backpack, the top of her shoe, and the bathroom floor over the course of one therapy session. Even more encouraging was that Molly was able to complete these exposures without the therapist needing to do anything other than being present during them. Molly still remembered how to do exposures and was able to do so in a graded manner. She was also able to tolerate the resulting anxiety during exposures and experienced only mild-to-moderate anxiety during the exposures. However, Molly reported that she would experience a severe level of anxiety if she had to touch the bottom of her shoe and lick her hand or eat off of the floor.\n\n【21】Molly was asked if she would be willing to complete those exposures, and the rationale for tackling those items at the top of her hierarchy was reviewed. Molly agreed to complete the exposures but stated that she did not believe that her mother would be on board with them. Molly was correct in this assumption and when her mother was brought into the therapy session, she again expressed disbelief and disgust that this would be included as a target in therapy. The rationale was reviewed again, and this time Molly stepped in and told her mother that she understood that her mother did not agree with this course of action but that she believed that she needed to complete these exposures in order to fully recover from OCD. Her mother indicated that she would support Molly if that was what Molly thought was best.\n\n【22】Another booster session was scheduled and Molly brought in several types of food items to eat off of the floor. She was able to complete the exposure of touching the bottom of her shoe and licking her hand. In fact, she reported that she only became moderately anxious when doing this exposure and that it was not as bad as she had expected. Molly was also able to eat off of the floor—initially, she was able to eat foods that touched a napkin that had been placed on the floor and eventually was able to eat foods that sat on the floor, including foods that were placed on a stain that was on the therapist’s office floor. Again, Molly reported that her anxiety was lower than she had expected and that even though she did feel contaminated, she was able to tolerate the anxiety, and it peaked and passed much faster than she expected it to. Molly was given homework to continue to eat items that touched the floor and to touch the bottom of her shoe to items in her bedroom such as her pillowcase and clothing.\n\n【23】Molly followed up with a telephone call 2 weeks later, and reported that she had completed her homework and was not experiencing OCD symptoms. Follow-up assessments completed 3 months and 9 months later indicated that her CY-BOCS score was in the normative range (8 at 3 months and 6 at 9 months), and she did not meet criteria for depression or OCD.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

This accounts for 90% of HUS cases in children, with Streptococcus pneumoniae responsible for at least 5% of cases. Bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain are usually manifestations of hemorrhagic enterocolitis caused by Shiga toxin‐producing bacteria, most commonly Escherichia coli . Patients with Shiga toxin‐associated HUS have been described who do not have obvious diarrheal prodromes. On the other hand, patients with atypical HUS commonly present with abdominal pain and diarrhea, which may begin days to weeks before the patient seeks medical care, thus giving rise to the impression of diarrhea‐associated HUS. Diarrhea, with or without blood, is found in approximately 30% of patients with atypical HUS at disease onset because of gut involvement. For this reason, categorization of HUS according to clinical presentation as diarrhea‐positive or diarrhea‐negative is inappropriate.\n\n【22】Causes of HUS are typically related to exposure to contaminated food, especially undercooked beef, but can also result from certain medications, including quinine, ciclosporin, tacrolimus, some drugs of abuse including cocaine, some chemotherapeutics, and antiplatelet agents.\n\n【23】If a patient presents with a diarrheal prodrome, Shiga toxin‐associated HUS can easily be differentiated by the presence of Shiga toxin in the stools and/or serum antibodies against Shiga toxin. Another infectious form of HUS occurs with T‐antigen activation in association with pneumococcal sepsis and this can also easily be differentiated from atypical HUS.\n\n【24】Other potential differential diagnoses for a child who presents with bloody diarrhea include necrotizing enterocolitis, colitis, and inflammatory bowel disease among others. In this case, the child presents with very typical symptoms and laboratory findings of hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure.Additional Questions and Evidence‐based Rationale\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【25】1.  What is the best management for HUS?\n2.  How would you determine if the therapy was effective?\n3.  What other therapies would be recommended for HUS?\n4.  Would you obtain any other diagnostic studies?\n\n【26】### What is the best management for HUS?\n\n【27】Therapy for HUS is supportive and includes volume repletion, hypertension control, and managing complications of renal insufficiency, including dialysis when warranted. Red blood cell transfusions may be indicated. Platelet transfusions should be avoided since they may contribute to the thrombotic microangiopathy, and are indicated only by active hemorrhage or prior to a procedure. Early hydration during the diarrheal phase may lessen the severity of renal insufficiency. Most children with Shiga toxin‐associated HUS survive the acute phase and recover normal renal function.\n\n【28】### How would you determine if the therapy was effective?\n\n【29】Electrolytes will normalize and the child will show improved renal function along with normal blood pressure. Early hydration during the diarrheal phase may lessen the severity of renal insufficiency. Most children with Shiga toxin‐associated HUS recover and do not have chronic symptoms or problems, although some may show evidence of long‐term renal complications and other morbidity.\n\n【30】### What other therapies would be recommended for HUS?\n\n【31】Patients who experience volume overload, metabolic acidosis, electrolyte abnormalities, uremia or oliguria may require dialysis. Non‐oliguric patients usually recover well, but there still remains an increased risk for future renal complications, including chronic kidney disease.\n\n【32】### Would you obtain any other diagnostic studies?\n\n【33】Additional tests to include are stool culture for E. coli , stool test for Shiga toxin, and liver enzymes. A renal ultrasound may be helpful in determining category of acute kidney injury.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

He is 72 in tall and 80 kg in weight.\n\n【2】What is the most important initial step in the management of this patient?\n\n【3】What are other management considerations?\n\n【4】ANSWERS TO CASE 8：Airway Management/Respiratory Failure\n\n【5】Summary： This 22-year-old boxer has inspiratory stridor， which indicates impending respiratory failure due to upper airway obstruction or collapse.\n\n【6】Most important initial management： 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Rapid-sequence intubation (RSI) to protect the airway； 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> avoid the use of a nasal gastric tube (NGT) since this patient has facial trauma， and there is risk of perforation of the cribriform plate by the NGT. Insertion via the mouth is the preferred option.\n\n【7】Other steps： Chest x-ray to evaluate the trachea and correct placement of the endotracheal tube (ETT) as well as pneumothorax. If cerebral edema is present， high minute ventilation should be used to produce a respiratory alkalosis to decrease intracranial pressure (ICP). Positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) should not be excessive to avoid increasing ICP. Propofol is indicated for induc-tion and sedation since it lowers ICP， has anti-seizure activity， and has a rapid elimination profile allowing for accurate assessment of the CNS status.\n\n【8】Objectives\n\n【9】1\\. To understand the indications and contraindications for endotracheal in-tubation (ETI).\n\n【10】2\\. To understand alternative methods for airway control.\n\n【11】3. To understand the most common complications of endotracheal intubation.\n\n【12】4.To understand the required steps and tools for endotracheal intubation.\n\n【13】Considerations\n\n【14】This 22-year-old boxer presents with head and neck trauma and shows inspiratory stridor， which portends possible airway collapse. This requires RSI for the protec-tion and control of the airway. A“wait and see\"attitude in this patient would likely lead to devastating consequences. A nasogastric tube may be required to reduce the likelihood of aspiration of blood. Aspiration precautions were begun with elevation of the head of the bed to 45 degrees upright. Mechanical ventila-tion is begun on assist control (AC) mode of 22 breaths/minute with a tidal volume of 500 mL with a 100% Fio。 and a PEEP of 5. A higher minute ventilation is prudent to decrease intracerebral pressure.\n\n【15】APPROACH TO：Airway Management/Ventilator Support\n\n【16】INTUBATION IN CRITICAL CARE SETTINGS\n\n【17】The most common indication for endotracheal intubation (ETI) is to treat hypoxic respiratory failure and hypercarbic ventilatory failure. The initial treatment for hypoxia begins with the insertion of a low-flow nasal cannula and the delivery of about 3% per liter of Flo， then escalating to 100% with the use of a non-rebreather mask or high-flow O， therapy. Patients with impaired consciousness and an inability to protect their airway have secondary indications for ETl. One should assure that the patient does not have any documentation where endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation have been refused or where a do-not-intubate (DNI) or do not resuscitate (DNR) order exists. The patient’s wishes or those of the family or the legal guardian should be considered prior to further invasive measures. Other sec-ondary indications for ETI include the significant aspiration of particulate matter.\n\n【18】ETl may be indicated for patients requiring bronchoscopy and pulmonary lavage， those with neurological or traumatic injuries who need deep sedation and intuba-tion to perform necessary imaging tests or diagnostic and therapeutic procedures， and for individuals with status epileptics who require deep sedation or paralysis for treatment of seizures.\n\n【19】Endotracheal Intubation\n\n【20】Endotracheal intubation (ETI) is the definitive method for control of the airway， and a common procedure for patients undergoing general anesthesia. The laryngeal mask airway (LMA)， device that does not require a tube through the trachea or a laryngoscope for placement， and is an alternative for patients scheduled for shorter surgeries. The LMA is a short ETT-type tube that is surrounded and held in place by a laryngeal mask. The apex of the mask， with its open end pointing downward toward the tongue， is pushed backward toward the wvula. The LMA is effective as a short-term option and does not require as much expertise for placement as ETI. Those patients who may need airway control range from those scheduled to receive anesthesia to critically ill patients with multi-system disease or injuries. Emergency situations such as cardiac or respiratory arrest also require the need for ETI. It is effective in situations to protect the airway from aspiration， address inadequate oxygenation or ventilation， and for patients with existing or anticipated airway obstruction. These indications are increasingly more complicated in an era of advanced technology in oxygen delivery systems and noninvasive forms of ven-tilation. These forms can be divided in 3 basic categories： 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> hypoxic respiratory failure (decreased Po，)， 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> hypercarbic ventilator failure (including cardiac arrest)， drug overdose (elevated Pco，)， and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> impaired level of consciousness， requiring airway protection to prevent aspiration.\n\n【21】The excessive presence and inability of the patient to clear secretions are more important indicators for airway protection and ETI than is absence of the gag reflex. The lack of a gag reflex is not a sensitive predictor for ETI for airway control.\n\n【22】Checking of the gag reflex should be performed with suctioning equipment is at hand， since it may induce vomiting and cause aspiration. The accumulation of large amounts of secretions in the oral cavity， without ability to clear， is an indication for ETI. If the patient can speak， is cooperative， and responds to verbal questioning， then one should consider a trial of NIV (noninvasive ventilation)， provided it does not delay an eventual ETI. The assisted ventilation provided from NIV therapy can provide additional time for the treatment of underlying medical conditions with steroids， bronchodilators， diuretics， nitrates， or other medications.\n\n【23】Hypoxic Respiratory Failure\n\n【24】Hypoxic respiratory failure or Type 1 hypoxic respiratory failure is defined as hypox-emia without hypercarbia. An impairment of oxygen exchange via the pulmonary alveolar capillary membrane (>A-a gradient) results in hypoxemia， leading to a diminished delivery of oxygen to the cells and tissues. A quick and easy way to cal-culate the A-a gradient is shown later. You should not have a negative A-a gradient as determined by the equation：\n\n【25】The initial treatment of all causes of hypoxemia includes： (a) ensure a patent airway， (b) provide adequate ventilation， and (c) provide supplemental oxygen. A PAO， value of 60 mm Hg or an arterial oxygen saturation of 90% to 92% is often suggested as a minimal accepted value. Patients with hypoxemia will improve upon delivery of increasingly higher Fio， indicating VQ mismatch as the underlying pathophysiologic cause. If the hypoxemia is resistant to high Fio， concentration， the most likely cause is shunting (eg， ARDS).\n\n【26】The treatment of hypoxia begins by ensuring a patent airway for adequate ven-tilation and oxygenation of the patient. Trials of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) may be indicated， but this should not delay intubation and MV if needed. If the O， saturation fails to improve on 100% Fio。 then ETI and MV should be undertaken so PEEP can be administered.\n\n【27】Hypercarbic Ventilatory Failure (Paco，)\n\n【28】Hypercarbic ventilatory failure occurs when there is an inability to remove carbon dioxide (CO，) from the alveoli. This condition may be the result of a primary lung disorder or secondarily associated with cardiac， neurologic， or metabolic causes.\n\n【29】The symptoms and signs of hypercarbia are explained by the fact that increas-ing PACO， results in vasoconstriction， confusion， sedation， and acidosis. Diagnosis of hypercarbia is confirmed with an ABG with a PACO， >45 mm Hg and significant acidemia secondary to the elevated PAco，. The rate of change in PACO， will affect the signs and symptoms. If the change in Paco， is gradual， then the onset of symp-toms such as lethargy， headache， and confusion will be more gradual. However， if the PACO， rapidly changes， then the onset of symptoms will be more pronounced. Treat-ment of hypercarbic ventilator failure includes supplemental oxygenation and ensuring that the patient has a patent airway. The treatment should be specifically directed toward the underlying etiology. If the patient's condition does not improve with the initial treatment， then increasing the minute ventilation is necessary.\n\n【30】Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation should be attempted first unless there is an obvious need for an ETI. The indications for progressing to ETI are ventila-tory failure despite CPAP， signs of impending respiratory failure such as increasing dyspnea， tachypnea， the use of accessory breathing muscles， and low tidal volume ventilation.\n\n【31】Impaired Consciousness and Airway Protection\n\n【32】Patients with Glasgow coma scale (GCS) values of 8 or less should be intubated because of diminished levels of consciousness， continued hypoventilation， and a need for airway protection. Comatose patients have decreased respiratory drive， hypoventilation， airway obstruction and the decreased ability to clear secretions. Thirty percent of the patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage and traumatic brain injury are likely to develop pulmonary edema， severe acute adult lung injury， or ARDS. When there is concern of increased ICP and uncal herniation， hyperven-tilation with alkalosis has been shown to be helpful by inducing cerebral vasocon-striction. Propofol for sedation has also been shown to reduce intracranial pressure. Prolonged hyperventilation for prophylaxis of ICP should be avoided because of the risk for ischemic brain injury. Other indications for ETI include traumatic injury or swelling to the face or neck， or other obstructive airway processes.\n\n【33】Contraindications to Endotracheal Intubation\n\n【34】Because of the urgency for ventilatory support or airway control， relatively few contraindications exist for ETI. Direct laryngoscopy is contraindicated in patients with partial transection of the trachea because this can cause a complete loss of the airway. In this situation， one should consider establishing a surgical airway. If the cervical spine is unstable to bending as in RA， then strict， inline stabilization of the cervical spine is needed and must be maintained during ETI to avoid cord injury and paralysis. Of note， video-assisted ETT placement has reduced the need to hyperex-tend the neck during intubation.\n\n【35】Special Considerations\n\n【36】Before intubation， all the necessary equipment must be at hand. The recommended equipment includes： gloves， protective face shield， suction system， bag-valve mask ABTT1attached to an oxygen source， ETT with a stylet， 10 mL syringe， ETT holder， end-tidal carbon dioxide detector， stethoscope， and laryngoscope with blade or new fiberoptic technology. The fiberoptic laryngoscope allows visual guidance of the blade and observing the insertion of the ETT past the vocal cords. The two common types of blades currently in use are the Miller straight blade and the curved MacIn-tosh blade. ETTs are available in different internal diameters： 7.0， 7.5， and 8 mm. In adults， the 8-mm diameter tube should be used when possible. The tracheal size is best estimated by the patient's predicted BMI and not actual BMI. The ETT are available cuffed and uncuffed varieties. The uncuffed tubes are usually for children whereas the cuffed tubes are for older children and adults. Cuffs should not be over-inflated， since they are designed as large-volume， low-pressure systems to prevent mucosal ischemia of the trachea. Pre-oxygenation， with 100% oxygen by a non-rebreather mask or a bag-valve mask is necessary to increase oxygenation 删除换行1 in the blood； this is achieved by replacing the higher proportion of N， in the room air with oxygen. This is accomplished by using 100% O。 which also increases the patient's functional reserve capacity with oxygen and increases the interval before the next desaturation. Increasing the amount of oxygenation reduces the amount of positive-pressure ventilation， which reduces the risk of aspiration of gastric contents.\n\n【37】Before any procedure is initiated， one should confirm that consent forms have been signed， unless it is an emergency. If it is an emergency， one should ensure that there is no order for do-not-resuscitate (DNR) or a do-not-intubate (DNI). The stylet， is normally flexible and can be reshaped， is usually placed into the ETT to maintain the natural curvature of the airway. IV access should be established and the patient's vital signs should be continuously monitored. Proper positioning the patient before intubation is important. The patient's head should be level with the lower portion of the sternum. The “sniffing”position can be accomplished by plac-ing a pillow or folded towel beneath the patient's occiput. Alignment of the 3 axis of the oral cavity pharynx， and larynx， which is ideal for vocal cord visualization， can be arranged by flexing the neck and extending the head. Any dentures should be removed. An assistant should perform the Sellick maneuver (applying firm pres-sure to the cricoid cartilage)， which compresses the esophagus between the cricoid cartilage and the cervical vertebrae avoiding aspiration of the gastric content. This maneuver reduces the risk of passive aspiration of gastric contents and improves visualization of the glottis.\n\n【38】Neuromuscular blocking agents and strong sedatives are used to improve visualiza-tion of the vocal cords and to reduce the likelihood of vomiting and aspiration. Midazolam and fenyanyl are the hypnotic agents typically used for induction. Other combinations include thiopental and ketamine. A commonly used neuromuscular blocking agent is succinylcholine. Rocuronium is a substitute when there is a con-traindication for succinylcholine especially in the presence of hyperkalemia. Suc cinylcholine should be avoided in hyperkalemia because of the depolarization at the neuromuscular junction. Edema， obstruction， tumors， trauma， and infections can all increase the difficulty of intubation. Other situations that can make intuba-tion more difficult are small mandible， limited neck mobility， and edematous tongue(angioedema， amyloidosis). Neuromuscular blockers used to paralyze the patient for MV are associated with neurological deficits and sequelae and should be avoided.\n\n【39】Confirmation\nAfter the placement， the ETT should be in the mid trachea， with the ETT tip 3 to4 cm above the carina. Bilateral breath sounds and equal expansion of the lungs should be noted. An end-tidal carbon dioxide detector (capnography) needs to be connected to the ETT， and this monitor should change color within the first6 breaths. Lack of color change suggests that the ETT is not in the trachea. The ETT should be repositioned until the CO， monitor confirms correct endotracheal placement by changing colors. A chest x-ray is needed to verify ETT placement and ensure that the ETT is not in the right or left main stem bronchus. After successful 删除换行5 ETI， the tube should be secured via an ETT holder or adhesive tape. If facial hair interferes with securing the ETT， simply shave the patient.\n\n【40】Major complications of ETT placement include： bronchospasm， hypoxemia， hypercapnia， and death. Vom1i1tti1rng， bradycardia， laryngospasm， pneumonitis， and pneumonia are also seen. Some authorities recommend IV lidocaine prior to ETI to reduce ETI-induced bronchospasm. ETI and MV also are associated with increased cases of ICU delirium.\n\n【41】SUMMARY\n\n【42】The main goal of ETI and MV is to provide a patent airway for the delivery of oxy-gen and proper ventilation that are primary to a patient’s survival. This also allows suctioning of secretions， application of PEEP， and delivery of aerosolized medica tions. The decision to proceed with this invasive ETI requires an understanding of the pathologic and physiologic disorders that necessitate its use. A qualitative colorimetric EtCO， monitor is commonly used to determine placement and is nearly100% sensitive and specific for ETT placement in the trachea.\n删除16：<u>CLINICAL CASE CORRELATION\n\n【43】· See also Case 3 (Scoring Systems and Patient Prognosis)， Case 9 (Ventilator Management)， Case 11 (Asthmatic Management)， and Case 12 (Non-invasive Methods of Ventilatory Support).\n</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Although an ECG may demonstrate right heart strain in patients with  删除换行1 large emboli, the most common finding is simply a sinus tachycardia (or new-onset  删除换行1 atrial fibrillation in the elderly).

Alice is 45 years old, and following viral encephalitis she has been left with severe neurological impairment with no prospect of improvement. She cannot move or speak and is  删除换行1 entirely dependent on others for care. She is receiving clinically assisted nutrition and hydration. Alice was close to her father and sister and long-term partner. She does not have children. Her family considers that she would not wish to carry on living in this condition and  删除换行1 that feeding should be withheld so she can die peacefully and with dignity.\n\n【2】Paul is 42. He has a severe learning disability and end-stage renal failure secondary to diabetes. Unless he receives an organ transplant, his life expectancy is significantly reduced. He  删除换行1 requires dialysis three times a week. He has a needle phobia and due to his learning disabilities becomes physically aggressive and resists attempts by doctors to examine or treat him.\nIn order to carry out dialysis, he would require sedation by general anesthetic, which carries  删除换行1 inherent risks. His understanding of the situation is very limited.\n\n【3】Felicity is 55 years old and has a severe learning disability. She has localised cancer of the  删除换行1 uterus and her gynaecologist considers that without a hysterectomy the tumour will likely  删除换行1 metastasise and lead ultimately to her death.\n\n【4】Questions\n\n【5】• What factors should be considered in assessing the ‘best interests’ of an incompetent  删除换行1 adult patient?\n\n【6】• Who makes the decision about the patient’s best interests?\n\n【7】• What if the clinical team and the patient’s relatives disagree about what treatment is  删除换行1 in the patient’s best interests?\n\n【8】• Is it always in the patient’s best interests to do what the patient would most probably  删除换行1 have wanted if he had capacity?\n\n【9】ANSWER 32\n\n【10】If a patient lacks capacity to make a particular healthcare decision (Case 26), the justification  删除换行1 for treatment is that it is in his best interests. The Mental Capacity Act 2005 (MCA) sets out a  删除换行1 legal framework for the care and treatment of persons lacking capacity. Although it does not  删除换行1 define the term ‘best interests’, it sets out a checklist of factors that must be considered when  删除换行1 determining best interests. The person making the decision must consider, as far as is reasonably ascertainable, the patient’s past and present wishes, and the beliefs and values and other  删除换行1 factors that could have influenced their decision if they had capacity. This assessment of best  删除换行1 interests looks to what the person lacking capacity would have wanted, and therefore takes  删除换行1 non-medical issues into account. In addition to the checklist, ‘all relevant circumstances’  删除换行1 should be considered. For example, a doctor would need to consider the ‘clinical needs of  删除换行1 the patient, the potential benefits and burdens of the treatment on the person’s health and  删除换行1 life expectancy and any other factors relevant to making a professional judgement’ (MCA  删除换行3 Code of Practice). The doctor performing the particular medical treatment or procedure is  删除换行1 responsible for ensuring that the best interests of the patient have been considered by discussion with those interested in the welfare of the patient. Wherever possible, the patient should  删除换行1 be involved in the decision-making process.\n\n【11】The best interests test is not the same as ‘substituted judgement’. Judges have stated that  删除换行1 although the past and present wishes of the patient are very important in assessing best interests, they are not determinative. Despite her learning disabilities, Felicity has a good quality  删除换行1 of life and enjoys regular outings and visits from family. She has indicated that she does not  删除换行1 want surgery as she is frightened. However, without treatment she is likely to die. The stress  删除换行1 and anxiety that she may experience in having treatment is balanced against the fact that the  删除换行1 surgery is likely to be curative and therefore life preserving. There is a strong presumption  删除换行1 that it is in a person’s best interests to stay alive. The MCA requires that the treatment must  删除换行1 be no more than is necessary in order to treat them effectively (the least restrictive intervention principle).\n\n【12】The MCA requires that, where practical and appropriate, others who are close to the patient  删除换行1 should be consulted about what might be in the patient’s best interests. Alice’s family may be  删除换行1 able to give examples of conversations indicating her previous views which might be relevant  删除换行1 to her situation now, although even if that is possible they may have changed in light of her  删除换行1 current situation. When there is a conflict of opinion about whether a particular treatment  删除换行1 is in the patient’s best interests, which cannot be otherwise resolved, the Court of Protection  删除换行1 may be asked to adjudicate.\n\n【13】If the treatment proposed is overly burdensome in relation to the prospect of recovery or  删除换行1 quality of life which may be prolonged after treatment, then it may not be in the patient’s best  删除换行1 interests to initiate or continue it. Section 5 MCA enables the use of reasonable force to carry  删除换行1 out treatment. For Paul, although dialysis is life-preserving, the burdens of treatment are relevant in determining whether it is in his best interests. Ongoing treatment requiring general  删除换行1 anaesthetic, force and restraint and consequent apprehension and loss of dignity may be too  删除换行1 harmful to continue on a long-term basis.\n\n【14】Lasting power of attorney\n\n【15】A personal welfare lasting power of attorney (LPA) is a legal document which allows a person  删除换行1 to appoint someone (the attorney) to make healthcare decisions for them in the event of loss  删除换行1 of capacity. There may be restrictions about the types of decisions that can be taken, and 83 删除换行1 decisions about life-sustaining treatment can only be made if authority to do so is stated in  删除换行1 the LPA. Healthcare staff must discuss their proposed care plan with the person appointed  删除换行1 and obtain their agreement to it. Where the healthcare team disagrees with the attorney’s  删除换行1 assessment of the best interests of the patient, the case should be discussed with other medical experts. Ultimately, the issue may have to be resolved by the Court of Protection.\n\n【16】Independent mental capacity advocate\n\n【17】Independent mental capacity advocates (IMCAs) represent the views of vulnerable people  删除换行1 lacking capacity to make important decisions about serious medical treatment when there  删除换行1 are no family members or friends who can be consulted. They act as a check to ensure that  删除换行1 the proposed treatment is in the person’s best interests and therefore have the right to see  删除换行1 relevant healthcare records. They can challenge decisions that they do not think are in the  删除换行1 patient’s best interests, and they must be instructed and consulted in certain circumstances,  删除换行2 e.g. providing, withholding or stopping serious medical treatment and where the person will  删除换行1 stay in hospital longer than 28 days.\n\n【18】Ethical issues\n\n【19】The assessment of a person’s best interests uses consequentialist criteria. A ‘balance sheet’  删除换行1 should be drawn of the benefits and harms of treatment. A procedure that is invasive and  删除换行1 has harmful side effects would be in a patient’s best interests only if the benefits to be gained  删除换行1 outweigh the harms of treatment. The assessment of best interests could take into account  删除换行1 overall future benefit despite the immediate harm of carrying out treatment which the patient  删除换行1 does not want.\n\n【20】Key Points\n\n【21】• Alice, Paul and Felicity lack capacity, and therefore treatment decisions must be  删除换行1 taken in their best interests.\n\n【22】• The patient’s views and those of the carers and relatives should be taken into  删除换行1 account.\n\n【23】• A ‘best interests’ assessment is not relevant where a person has made a valid and  删除换行1 applicable advance decision.\n\n【24】• Staff should ask whether the patient has a LPA.\n\n【25】• Where an incompetent patient has no one to represent his best interests, an IMCA \n\n【26】must be consulted in connection with decisions about major medical treatment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

He is started empirically on several medications for his underlying disease. At follow-up several months later, he reports difficulty reading the paper in the morning and has been found to wear unusual color combinations at work. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient’s new symptoms?\n\n【1】> (A) Ethambutol toxicity\n\n【2】> (B) Isoniazid toxicity\n\n【3】> (C) Pyrazinamide toxicity\n\n【4】> (D) Rifampin toxicity\n\n【5】> (E) Tuberculous eye infection\n\n【6】 Answer: The correct answer is A. Ethambutol is active against Mycobacterium tuberculosis , and it is among the first-line agents used to treat tuberculosis (TB) infection (others are isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide). Ethambutol’s mechanism of action appears to be the inhibition of polymerization of cell-wall precursors. Although the drug generally is well tolerated, its most common adverse effects involve ocular toxicity such as loss of visual acuity and red-green color blindness, which usually appears several months after the initiation of treatment. Ethambutol usually is used in an anti-TB regimen with rifampin for patients who either cannot tolerate isoniazid or are infected with isoniazid-resistant M tuberculosis . For children, most literature supports a regimen of six months with isoniazid and rifampin, with additional coverage of pyrazinamide during the first two months.  \nAnswer B is incorrect. Although rifampin is considered the best antituberculous agent, isoniazid is used for prophylaxis in asymptomatic patients with a positive PPD test. A six-month course of isoniazid prevents activation of latent TB in 90% of patients for at least 20 years. Isoniazid blocks mycolic acid cell-wall synthesis and is bactericidal for rapidly multiplying organisms. Major adverse effects include hepatotoxicity and peripheral neuropathy, but many other adverse effects occur, such as lupus-like syndrome and optic atrophy.  \nAnswer C is incorrect. Like isoniazid, the spectrum of action of pyrazinamide is limited to Mycobacterium tuberculosis . The site of activity for pyrazinamide is thought to be a fatty acid synthase gene. The major adverse effect of pyrazinamide therapy is hepatotoxicity, but it is rare at recommended dosages. Another major adverse effect is hyperuricemia and subsequent gout.  \nAnswer D is incorrect. Rifampin is the most potent antituberculous agent available. Rifampin blocks DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, preventing RNA synthesis. Although it is a better agent than isoniazid for preventing active TB infection, it has a significant risk of liver toxicity that outweighs its benefits as a preventive medicine.  \nAnswer E is incorrect. Mycobacterium tuberculosis can have extrapulmonary manifestations, but the eye is not commonly involved. Miliary TB infection can affect the eye and cause chorioretinitis, uveitis, and conjunctivitis, but these manifestations are rare. Color blindness would not be associated with such an infection.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Rods mediate achromatic vision in star-light or moonlight whereas cones are important for colour vision and fine acuity in daylight.\n\n【25】How may retinitis pigmentosa present?\n\n【26】It may present with defective vision at dusk (night blindness)， which may occur several years before the pigment is visible in the retina.\n\n【27】ADVANCED-LEVEL QUESTIONS\n\n【28】Mention a few systemic disorders a Sassociated with retinitis pigmentosa\n\n【29】●Laurence-Moon-Biedl-Bardet syndrome， which is a recessively inherited disorder characterized by mental disability， polydactyly， syndactyly， hypogonadism， obesity and renal disease (structural abnormalities such as calyceal cysts or calyceal clubbing and blunting).\n\n【30】Basser-Konzweig syndrome (abetalipoproteinaemia)， characterized by fat malabsorption， abetalipoproteinaemia， acanthocytosis and spinocere-bellar ataxia 删除10：<u>(Ophthalmology 1984；91：991)</u>.\n\n【31】Refsum's disease (phytanic acid storage disease)， an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by hypertrophic peripheral neuropathy， deaf-ness， ichthyosis， cerebellar ataxia， raised CSF protein levels in the absence of pleocytosis.\n\n【32】Kearns-Sayre syndrome， a triad of retinitis pigmentosa， progressive exter-nal ophthalmoplegia and heart block 删除10：<u>(Br JOphthalmol 1985；69：63)</u>.\n\n【33】Usher’s disease， a recessively inherited disorder characterizedby congenital， non-progressive， sensorineural deafness 删除10：<u>(Arch Ophthalmol1983；101：1367)</u>.\n\n【34】●Friedreich's ataxia 通用删除11(英):<u>(p.267)</u>.\n\n【35】What do you know about the genetics of retinitis pigmentosa?\n\n【36】More than 45 genes for retinitis pigmentosa have been described. These genes account for only about 60% of all patients； the remainder have defects in as yet unidentified genes. Exceptions being the：\n\n【37】·RHO， gene for rhodopsin gene， which leads to about 25% of dominant retinitis pigmentosa\n\n【38】USH2A， which might cause about 20% of recessive disease (including many with Usher syndrome type II)\n\n【39】· RPGR， which accounts for about 70% of X-linked retinitis pigmentosa.\n\n【40】Mutations in RHO， USH2A， and RPGR cause about 30% of all cases of retinitis pigmentosa in aggregrate.\n\n【41】Which ocular conditions are associated with retinitis pigmentosa?\n\n【42】Open-angle glaucoma\n\n【43】Posterior subcapsular cataracts\n\n【44】Myopia\n\n【45】● Keratoconus.\n\n【46】What is secondary retinitis pigmentosa?\n\n【47】Secondary retinitis pigmentosa is a sequela to inflammatory retinitis.

This has lasted for 4 hours. She describes the pain  删除换行1 as tearing in nature and scores it as 10/10 in severity. Her medical history is significant  删除换行1 for hypertension, for which she takes regular bendroflumethiazide tablets. She takes no  删除换行1 other medication.\n\n【3】Examination\n\n【4】This elderly woman is clearly uncomfortable, despite opiate analgesia being given. There  删除换行1 is a loud, early diastolic murmur which is loudest at the aortic region. There is a collapsing pulse. Observations: heart rate 120/min, blood pressure 102/50 mmHg in her left arm  删除换行1 and 80/38 mmHg in her right arm. A chest X-ray is shown in Fig. 14.1.\n\n【5】删除3：<u>Figure 14.1</u>\n\n【6】Questions\n\n【7】• What does the chest X-ray show?\n\n【8】• What is the likely diagnosis?\n\n【9】• How would you treat this woman?\nANSWER 14\n\n【10】Tearing chest pain radiating to the back should make you suspicious of an aortic dissection. This occurs when the inner lining of the aorta shears away from the vessel wall and  删除换行1 blood flows between the layers, separating them. This can lead to aortic rupture, which  删除换行1 has an 80 per cent mortality rate.\n\n【11】When the ascending thoracic aorta and/or the aortic arch are involved, this is referred to  删除换行1 as a type A dissection, whereas type B dissections involve the descending thoracic aorta.\nThe disparity in blood pressure between the arms indicates that the arch is involved.\n\n【12】There is a widened mediastinum on the chest X-ray. This can suggest that there is dissection of the thoracic aorta. The clinical signs of differing blood pressure in each arm,  删除换行1 tachycardia and aortic regurgitation (early diastolic murmur in aortic region, collapsing  删除换行1 pulse) are compatible with this diagnosis.\n\n【13】There is little you can do medically for this patient. You should ensure that she has good  删除换行1 intravenous access and that she has cross-matched blood available for transfusion. Her  删除换行1 blood pressure and heart rate will need to be closely managed. To prevent further shearing of the aorta, her systolic blood pressure will need to be kept below 100 mmHg. An  删除换行1 infusion of a beta-blocker drug (e.g. labetalol) is typically used to do this.\n\n【14】The patient will probably need a central venous line, and transfer either directly to theatre  删除换行1 for an aortic repair or to an intensive-care unit for initial stabilization. The intensivecare team, anaesthetists and surgeons should be notified about the patient immediately.\nUltimately, the patient will need an aortic repair to be done as soon as possible.\n\n【15】KEY POINTS\n\n【16】• Central chest pain radiating to the back should alert to the possibility of aortic  删除换行1 dissection.\n\n【17】• Early involvement of surgical, anaesthetic and intensive-care teams will be needed to  删除换行1 manage the patient, who is likely to need aggressive stabilization and surgery.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

His condition rapidly deteriorates, and he spends 2 weeks in the intensive care unit before his condition improves. He is discharged home after 6 weeks in the hospital and is home in time to celebrate the New Year holiday. You rounded on the patient each day during his hospitalization, including during your holiday vacation. The patient’s wife is so appreciative of your dedication and support during the hospitalization that she brings you a designer briefcase as a thank you gift.

You cannot accept the briefcase based on its value.\n\n【9】 Could you accept a bottle of wine? You may be able to accept a gift of lesser or nominal value based on individual institutional policies.\n\n【10】### ANALYSIS\n\n【11】##### Objectives\n\n【12】1\\. Identify types of boundaries encountered as a physician.\n\n【13】2\\. Identify circumstances in which professional boundary issues may be violated.\n\n【14】3\\. Describe concerns that stem from physicians accepting gifts from patients.\n\n【15】4\\. Describe concerns about connecting with your patients on social media websites.\n\n【16】##### Considerations\n\n【17】While some boundary violations are clear, such as entering into a sexual relationship with a patient, others are not as clear as in the case of gifts. Although it may be flattering to receive gifts from patients expressing their gratitude for the care you provide, receiving particularly lavish or expensive gifts is problematic. In this case, the patient’s family offered a briefcase of significant value, which should not be accepted.\n\n【18】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【19】#### Boundary Issues\n\n【20】### DEFINITION\n\n【21】PROFESSIONAL BOUNDARIES : A set of conditions that describe the limits of a fiduciary relationship—in other words, a relationship in which a person (the patient) entrusts his or her welfare to another person (the physician) who receives a fee for performing a service.\n\n【22】### CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【23】##### Types of Boundaries\n\n【24】There will always be an inherit power differential between a patient and a physician. Despite our best efforts as providers, laypersons may not fully understand their medical conditions, possible complications, or treatment options. Patients trust and depend upon us as their providers to take care of them to the best of our ability. It is this dependency, and its subsequent power differential, that can lead to potential boundary issues between provider and patient.\n\n【25】It is important to distinguish between boundary crossing and boundary violations. Minor boundary crossings are not exploitative and may be helpful in some instances. Imagine the soothing effects of rubbing a patient’s hand during a painful lumbar puncture, a behavior that counters the usual recommendations about touching outside the physical examination. Boundary crossings can be distinguished from damaging boundary violations, which are universally unethical. The most extreme form of a boundary violation is any sexual contact between a current patient and physician. Many instances of physician–patient sexual relationships are preceded by nonsexual boundary crossings that may lead to a boundary violation. Other possible boundary problems that may arise and must be considered include gifts, misuse of the physical examination, and dual relationships.\n\n【26】##### Sexual Boundary Violations\n\n【27】The most easily recognized boundary violations in medicine are sexual in nature. Physician–patient sexual relations of any type are considered to be inappropriate and unethical regardless of who initiated the relationship. A sexual encounter with a patient constitutes a breach of trust that is fundamental in the physician–patient relationship. A person seeking care is often at his or her most emotionally or physically vulnerable, making mutual consent to a sexual encounter or relationship impossible. Sexual relationships between former patients and physicians is less absolute, but they should be approached with extreme caution.\n\n【28】##### Gift Giving\n\n【29】Patients may wish to show caregivers appreciation by bringing gifts to their provider. Although small gifts as cookies or alcohol during the holidays may represent benign boundary crossings rather than serious violations, more expensive gifts have been cited as problematic from 2 standpoints. First, gift giving may be a conscious or unconscious bribe by the patient, designed to keep aggression, negative feelings or unpleasant subjects out of the doctor–patient relationship. For example, the patient may bring the doctor and the staff lunch to keep them from getting upset about frequently missing scheduled appointments. Second, there is often a secret or even explicit expectation of some reward or acknowledgment involved in performing services or bestowing a gift, whether that be better care or the expectation of improved outcomes. There are no definitive rules or fixed values to determine when a physician should or should not accept a gift. The American Medical Association (AMA) suggests that, when deciding to accept a gift, the physician should evaluate if he or she would be comfortable if their colleagues, or the public, knew about acceptance of the gift.\n\n【30】##### Physical Examination\n\n【31】Patients are often anxious and uncomfortable during a physical examination but often will go along with what the physician believes is necessary. For example, during his annual examination, a male patient who abuses alcohol may submit to a breast or testicular examination even though he does not question you, nor does he understand that you are evaluating for gynecomastia or testicular atrophy associated with his chronic disease. At best this can lead to failure to keep future appointments or transferring to another doctor; at worst, it could lead to a sexual harassment lawsuit. The physician should always explain all parts of the physical examination, but particular care needs to be undertaken to explain to a patient why examining the genitals, breasts, or other sensitive areas is necessary. If the patient hesitates, then the physician should encourage questions or expressions of concern that can then be clarified. Because the physician cannot know how a certain patient is likely to respond to various aspects of touching in the physical examination, clear communication is of paramount importance. A chaperone should always be considered, particularly when performing an examination on a patient of the opposite sex.\n\n【32】##### Dual Relationships\n\n【33】An essential element of the physician’s role is the fiduciary duty that is owed specifically that what is best for the patient must be the physician’s first priority. Dual relationship refers to any relationship that coexist simultaneously beyond that of physician–patient relationship, for example, dual relationships may exist with family members, friends, sexual partners, employees, or business associates. These dual relationships have the potential to undermine the physician’s ability to focus primarily on the patients’ well-being, and can affect the physician’s judgment. This concept is central to why physicians should not treat family members. It may be difficult to see the harm in caring for your aunt if you imagine just providing annual well women examinations. However, imagine this same aunt who you know to be struggling for years with infertility, but you now are managing because of profuse bleeding whom you know requires emergency hysterectomy to save her life. Would you be able to perform it? Would you be able to eat holiday dinner with her if you eliminated her ability to carry a child by performing the hysterectomy? Relationships outside the physician–patient relationship can affect the physician’s judgment and can compromise his or her objectivity.\n\n【34】The ability to separate oneself from dual relationships becomes more difficult for providers in rural settings where they may be the only physician in a town or are returning to small towns where they grew up. It has been suggested that boundary guidelines must be applied flexibly in rural areas where a provider may be the only provider for hundreds of miles; however, the same principles of boundaries should still be recognized and maintained.\n\n【35】##### Boundaries and Social Media\n\n【36】The Internet has positively impacted the ability for the medical profession to exchange and relay information to the public in a way never experienced before. However, in social media, a provider’s personal presence on social networking sites must still respect physician–patient boundaries. In 2011, the AMA issued guidelines on professionalism in the use of social media. The AMA recommends that physicians consider separating personal and professional content online, and there should be no differences in the online and in-person physician–patient relationship. It argues that online friendships with patients may open the door to boundary violations whether online, in person, or possibly romantic. A request from a patient to connect with a physician via a social networking website should be declined, and the patient should be referred to the physician’s professional page.\n\n【37】###", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

{"seq_id": "5941ae38-295a-4a08-9e61-bd4bcf734f08", "title": null, "text": "【0】##### The ethical foundations for a neurological standard of death\n\n【1】###### Philosophical underpinnings of differing neurological standards of death\n\n【2】The philosophical question of why brain death should be equated with the death of a patient has been answered largely either in terms of sociological traditions or bio-philosophical arguments. Several arguments have been made in support of a neurological standard, and they have great import for the resultant neurological standard, if any, that is advocated. The current review will focus briefly on three common ethical foundations used in support of a neurological standard of death.\n\n【3】###### Formulations of a neurological standard based on a reliance on cultural traditions\n\n【4】Defenders of various formulations of the neurological standard of death sometimes reference or explicitly rely on sociological traditions for their justification of a particular standard. For example, neurologist Christopher Pallis,通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>6 </sup></u> one of the early developers of the UK standard, justified his country’s standard in reference to a tradition that equates both breathing and consciousness to the existence of the human soul. The tradition focusing on apnea and unconsciousness does indeed have quite a strong history within the Judeo-Christian framework of which Pallis was a part.\n\n【5】Genesis 2:7 recounts “and the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul.”通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>7 </sup></u> This tying together the idea of breath – albeit a positive pressure breath! – with the essence of life has resonated deeply through Western culture. The Christian doctrine that the soul departs the body at the time of death has been interpreted by many theologians, Pope Pius XII among them, as meaning that the soul leaves the body at the time of irreversible loss of consciousness. It is of interest to note that the sole reference listed in the Harvard committee’s original report was a speech by Pius XII.\n\n【6】It is, of course, possible to advocate an apnea and unconsciousness standard on non-religious grounds. In addition, it is possible to advocate for other neurological standards – or none at all – based on tradition. Any standard thus formulated is subject to all the strengths and weaknesses of all arguments from tradition. Some thinkers might argue that all neurological standards share at some level such a philosophical foundation.\n\n【7】###### Formulations of the neurological standard based on “loss of personhood:”\n\n【8】Some justifications for a neurological standard resort to a “loss of personhood” argument, asserting that the absence of a particular set of functions – often permanent lack of consciousness and reasoning ability – even when they occur independently from the death of the human organism, may nevertheless suffice for the ethical and legal determination of death of the person.\n\n【9】Such a theory finds resonance in the Western canon at least as far back as Aristotle who argued that the rational soul was the unique and essential characteristic of man. Some argue that an individual who lacks such capability has lost his or her essential claim to personhood. This stance may have provided the ethical foundation for a decision by the American Medical Association Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs in 1995, that advocated for the use of anencephalic neonates as organ donors.通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>1 </sup></u> Such neonates are born without a brain cortex and could reasonably be assumed to lack the possibility of a meaningfully conscious life.\n\n【10】In accord with the AMA council’s philosophical view of personhood, it might have been reasonable to assume (though the council disputed this suggestion) that not only anencephalic newborns, but any persistently vegetative patients who lacked function beyond primitive brainstem activities might reasonably qualify to be considered dead-as-people. The council subsequently reversed their stance regarding anencephalic babies,通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>1 </sup></u> presumably concluding that denying personhood based on an ill-defined threshold of higher order brain functions was a hopelessly messy enterprise, with possibly untoward slippery slope implications. As a matter of law, there is no jurisdiction that currently equates persistently vegetative states with death.\n\n【11】Loss of personhood arguments, however, can also be used to advocate for other standards, including the whole brain death standard. In separating the death of the person from the ultimate death of the patient, such a formulation resonates with the common desire to call a person with a beating heart still living. In doing so, however, such arguments shy away from advocating for a truly neurological standard of death equivalent to the cardiovascular standard. It may be this argument that has prevailed in some jurisdictions where next-of-kin may refuse a neurological standard altogether. If the neurological standard of death were truly equivalent to a cardiovascular death in the eyes of the legislators who passed such laws, it would be difficult to imagine that they could grant a family the right to consider a dead patient alive, no matter what the family’s beliefs.\n\n【12】###### Foundations specific to the whole brain death neurological standard\n\n【13】So far in this discussion, we have seen that even among people who agree that a neurological standard of death should exist, the specifics of what such death should entail as well as the arguments used in their support can be vastly different. Of the few positions outlined above, one relies on an exclusively brainstem-based standard while another relies on an exclusively cortical standard. We will now turn to an ethical foundation that may be specific to the whole brain death standard.\n\n【14】The bio-philosophical position that was expounded by some members of the United States President’s Council on Bioethics in their 2009 report advocates for the whole brain death standard. In contrast to the “loss of personhood” standard, they dispute that there can be the death of the person independent from some more fundamental phenomenon of organismal death.\n\n【15】Specifically, they assert that there is only one death, and that permanent and total brain failure, including both cortex and brainstem, is its necessary harbinger. Underlying their stance is the argument that a living human organism must of essence exhibit “self-preserving commerce with the world” including some inchoate expression of neediness and actions to satisfy those needs. The necessary qualities for human organismal life have been expressed by one author as “openness to the surrounding environment, ability to act upon that environment, and inner experience of need.”\nIn accord with this philosophical position, the neurological standard that would warrant a declaration of death is more stringent than both a “loss of breath and consciousness” standard as well as most incarnations of a “loss of personhood” standard. This philosophical stance requires that function of the entire brain – including cortical and brainstem activity – cease prior to the determination of death. The majority of the Presidential council that delineated this standard supported the current United States standard of whole brain death even as they provided a new philosophical grounding for it.\n\n【16】They rejected an exclusive reliance on brainstem death – the apnea and unconsciousness standard of England and India – largely based on epistemological grounds. The principal objection was that the inner state of a person with cortical electrical activity after brain stem death is fundamentally unknowable, and it would therefore be problematic to conclude that there was a definitive lack of consciousness in cases of continued cortical activity. There may be good reason for such doubt, given recent strong evidence for the preservation of higher-order consciousness in some patients previously considered to be in persistently vegetative states.\nBy their standard, they also would reject a purely cortical definition of brain death, since in their view a spontaneously breathing but unconscious person would still possess a primitive neediness, openness to the world, and ability to act and would thus fulfill the criteria for continued life. It is notable that hypothalamic activity was not addressed in detail by the President’s council in their report, which leads to the question of why temperature autoregulation (a feature of hypothalamic activity) would not also qualify as an inchoate self-preserving commerce with the world that was worthy of being called life.\n\n【17】The whole brain death standard – with slight variations – has come to be the most widely held international neurological standard of death. While the philosophical foundations underlying the whole brain death standard may include arguments from tradition, loss-of-personhood arguments, or other arguments not described here, it seems that the “self-preserving commerce with the world” stance may be most specific to a whole brain death standard.\n\n【18】#### Case resolution\n\n【19】###### Determining the time of death – the essence of the neurological standard\n\n【20】From a legal standpoint, most jurisdictions hold that when the neurological standard of death has been satisfied, it is legally equivalent to a declaration of death based on cessation of cardiovascular function. Such jurisdictions would hold that the neurologist’s first declaration of death was the correct one.\n\n【21】From an ethical standpoint, according to the “self-preserving commerce with the world” stance, as well as many arguments based on sociological tradition, a brain dead patient is fundamentally equivalent to a corpse. As such, a person fulfilling the whole brain death criteria should be considered not just dead as a person, but dead as an organism. Such an ethical standpoint therefore would agree that the neurologist’s original declaration of death was correct and that the subsequent declaration the following day misunderstood the essence and practical import of a neurological standard of death.\n\n【22】In this regard, the “loss of personhood” stance fundamentally differs from the other philosophical stances since it maintains a distinction between death of the person and death of the organism. Although few jurisdictions follow this distinction, an argument could be made under the loss of personhood standard that both declarations of death in the case above were correct – the neurologist’s declaration of death was in reference to the death of the person and second declaration was in reference to the death of the organism. Such a distinction is still widely held in the public and the press as evidenced by frequent reports of brain dead patients “being kept alive” on life support pending final care decisions. For most advocates of a neurological standard, such a statement is accurate only in reference to persistently vegetative patients.\n\n【23】Whether or not a ventilator remains on or off and whether or not there is a blood pressure, most jurisdictions hold that a brain dead patient is a corpse. This is the essence of the neurological standard of death, and both doctors and society at large continue to struggle with its justification.\n\n【24】#### Key points\n\n【25】• Advances in medical technology and transplantation lead to the re-defining of death to include not only cardiopulmonary death, but death by virtue of “brain death.”\n\n【26】• The medical and legal definitions of brain death vary slightly among countries – with some using a “whole brain” definition of death in which no cortical activity may be present, and some relying on a “brainstem” standard, in which some cortical activity may be detectable.\n\n【27】• In all countries where brain death is recognized legally, the diagnosis rests with physical examination, at times supported by further medical testing.\n\n【28】• Philosophical arguments for the integrity of brain death as a definition of death rest in historic religious and social concepts of what constitutes life, or with ideas that loss of “personhood” may be equivalent to, or another form of, death.\n\n【29】• Because of differences in social, religious and cultural beliefs, “brain death” is by no means universally accepted, and continued debate can be expected regarding what, if any, neurological standard of death should be recognized.\n\n【30】####", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

During the preceding 6 months, she had unintentionally  删除换行1 lost 4 to 5 kg of weight, despite having a good appetite. There was no history of  删除换行1 excessive thirst or frequent urination, but she passed 3 to 4 semiformed stools  删除换行1 everyday.

There was  删除换行1 no history of prolonged febrile illness with joint pains during her childhood and she  删除换行1 had never received monthly shots of penicillin. The patient was married since 16  删除换行1 years and had two sons who were 13 and 9 years of age.

Instead,  删除换行1 there are numerous, small, irregular fibrillatory waves (f waves) that are difficult  删除换行1 to identify individually but produce a ragged baseline. In long-standing atrial  删除换行1 fibrillation, these undulations are minimal and produce a nearly flat baseline.\nAs mentioned, the ventricular rate is grossly irregular and varies from 100 to 150  删除换行1 beats per minute. Atrial fibrillation can be differentiated from atrial flutter by the  删除换行1 absence of P waves and an irregular ventricular rate . At times, precise  删除换行1 differentiation between the two may be difficult and the rhythm is then known as  删除换行1 “flutter-fibrillation”, “coarse fibrillation” or “impure flutter”.\n\n【16】删除3：<u> Figure 44.2: Diagram to illustrate atrial islets  删除换行1 with chaotic atrial activation</u>\n\n【17】In atrial fibrillation, the ventricular rate generally varies from 100 to 150 beats  删除换行1 per minute.

Slower rates are observed during drug treatment \n\n【18】ECG INTERPRETATION \nThe ECG showed a fast irregular rhythm, with a variable R-R interval. The QRS  删除换行5 complexes were narrow, but no P waves were visible. Instead, there were fine  删除换行1 fibrillatory waves between the QRS complexes. These findings are consistent with  删除换行1 the diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (AF). Atrial fibrillation is a grossly irregular fast  删除换行1 rhythm produced by functional fractionation of the atria into numerous tissue  删除换行1 islets, in various stages of excitation and recovery. Consequently, atrial activation  删除换行1 is chaotic and ineffectual in causing atrial contraction 删除33：<u></u>. Although 400  删除换行1 to 500 fibrillatory impulses reach the A-V node per minute, only 100 to 150 of  删除换行1 them succeed in eliciting a ventricular response, while others are blocked in the \n\n【19】A-V node. The random activation of the ventricles produces a grossly irregular  删除换行1 ventricular rhythm.

Elderly patients with A-V nodal  删除换行1 disease may also manifest slow atrial fibrillation. Regularization of the ventricular  删除换行1 rate in a patient on digitalis for atrial fibrillation, indicates the onset of junctional  删除换行1 tachycardia and is a manifestation of digitalis toxicity.\nCLINICAL DISCUSSION \n\n【37】Atrial fibrillation (AF) can be classified into three groups. In paroxysmal AF,  删除换行1 discrete episodes are self-terminating and last less than 48 hours. In persistent AF,  删除换行1 fibrillation continues unabated for atleast 7 days, but can be converted to sinus  删除换行1 rhythm by electrical or chemical cardioversion. In permanent AF, fibrillation  删除换行1 continues indefinitely and conversion to sinus rhythm is not possible. Atrial  删除换行1 fibrillation can occur in virtually any form of heart disease. Common causes of  删除换行1 atrial fibrillation are given in Table 44.2. \n\n【38】The symptoms of AF depend upon the ventricular rate, the nature and severity  删除换行1 of underlying heart disease and the effectiveness of treatment. Palpitation is due  删除换行1 to fast heart rate while syncope is caused by reduced cerebral perfusion. Angina  删除换行1 may occur because of increased myocardial oxygen demand as well as shortened  删除换行1 coronary filling time due to tachycardia. Dyspnea is due to pulmonary congestion,  删除换行1 secondary to loss of atrial contribution to ventricular filling. Sometimes, regional  删除换行1 ischemia in the form of limb gangrene, hemiparesis or blindness may occur  删除换行1 because of systemic embolization from a left atrial thrombus.\nAtrial fibrillation can be recognized clinically by several subtle signs. The  删除换行1 pulse is irregularly irregular, with the pulse rate on palpation being less than the  删除换行1 heart rate on auscultation (pulse deficit). The a waves are not observed in the  删除换行1 neck veins. There is a beat-to-beat variability in the pulse pressure as well as the  删除换行1 intensity of first heart sound, because of a variable ventricular diastolic filling  删除换行1 period. 202 Section 13 Cardiac Arrhythmias\n\n【39】Table 44.3: Management of atrial fibrillation\n\n【40】•  Heart-rate control\n\n【41】•  Anticoagulation\n\n【42】•  Electrical cardioversion\n\n【43】•  Radiofrequency ablation\n\n【44】MANAGEMENT ISSUES \n\n【45】The treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) is governed by the patient’s symptoms  删除换行1 and hemodynamic status. In the majority of patients, long-term rate control  删除换行1 along with oral anticoagulation, is a reasonable therapeutic strategy. Drugs that  删除换行1 prolong the refractory period of the atrio-ventricular (AV) node such as digoxin,  删除换行1 diltiazem and metoprolol are effective for rate control in persistent AF. In patients  删除换行1 of paroxysmal AF with infrequent episodes, a “pill in the pocket” (taken when  删除换行1 symptomatic) strategy is preferable. Drugs used for this purpose are amiodarone,  删除换行1 sotalol, flecainide and propafenone.\nLong-standing atrial fibrillation produces stasis of blood in the left atrium and  删除换行1 promotes the development of thrombi in the atrial cavity and the atrial appendage.\nDislodged fragments of these thrombi can enter the systemic circulation as emboli  删除换行1 and settle down in any arterial territory. Anti-coagulants such as caumarin and  删除换行1 warfarin are required for long-term use in chronic atrial fibrillation, to reduce  删除换行1 the likelihood of systemic embolization. This particularly applies to patients with  删除换行1 rheumatic heart disease and to prosthetic valve recipients. Those patients with  删除换行1 a previous history of thrombo-embolism (stroke or TIA) and those who have a  删除换行1 documented atrial thrombus, are also candidates for long-term anticoagulant  删除换行1 therapy.\nIf the patient’s clinical status is poor and hemodynamics are unstable, electrical  删除换行1 cardioversion with 100 to 200 Joules of energy is the treatment of choice, in an  删除换行1 attempt to restore sinus rhythm. There are two requisites before cardioversion is  删除换行1 attempted. Firstly, the patient should not have received digitalis in the previous  删除换行1 48 hours. Digitalis not only decreases the threshold for defibrillation, but also  删除换行1 predisposes to the risk of life-threatening arrhythmias. Secondly, an oral anticoagulant should be initiated before cardioversion and continued for atleast  删除换行1 four weeks. This is because atrial thrombi are more likely to dislodge as emboli,  删除换行1 once sinus rhythm is restored. Cardioversion should not be attempted if there is a  删除换行1 documented left atrial clot.\nIn patients who are symptomatic but either refractory or intolerant to several  删除换行1 antiarrhythmic agents, the final option is of radiofrequency ablation (RFA).\nAdvantages of RFA are not only freedom from symptoms but also avoidance of  删除换行1 the toxic effects of antiarrhythmic drugs and the need to monitor anticoagulant  删除换行1 therapy.\n\n【46】CASE", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Additionally， if ischemia is prolonged， it can lead to significant tissue damage causing diminished limb function， muscle contractures， and possible limb loss.\n\n【10】ANALYSIS\n\n【11】Objectives\n\n【12】1\\. Understand the pathophysiology underlying compartment syndrome as well as the clinical signs and symptoms of the condition.\n\n【13】2\\. Describe the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to compartment syndrome.\n\n【14】3\\. Understand the complications caused by the direct effects of elevated compart-ment pressures， as well as complications from myoglobinemia.\n\n【15】Considerations\n\n【16】The patient’s history of prolonged lower extremity ischemia should raise the con-cern for the development of a compartment syndrome. Although most frequently associated with trauma， a number of nontraumatic injuries can also lead to the development of a compartment syndrome， such as reperfusion or rhabdomyolysis. This patient had an acute thrombosis of his popliteal artery with subsequent ischemia to his lower leg and foot for 8 hours. Many advocate performing prophylactic fasci-otomies in any patient whose ischemia time， from an injury such as this one， exceeds4 to 6 hours. Although the patient does not present with all of the classic “5 Ps”(see“Definitions”in the next section) it is rare to see a patient who in fact has all5 signs and symptoms. The presence of all“5 Ps”typically represents a severe and advanced stage of compartment syndrome. The presence of palpable pulses should not impede your diagnosis of a compartment syndrome if other clinical findings sug-gest the diagnosis. Loss of pulses is typically the last sign and requires a significant intra-compartment pressure. Waiting for the patient to lose pulses will result in a more extensive injury to the compartmental muscle and nerves as well as increasing the risk for and severity of renal damage.\n\n【17】APPROACH TO：\n\n【18】DEFINITIONS\n\n【19】COMPARTMENT SYNDROME： A clinically diagnosed condition of increased intra-compartmental pressure within a closed space， causing reduced tissue perfusion and subsequent tissue necrosis.\n\n【20】5 Ps： Five signs and symptoms classically found in patients with compartment syn-drome， including： pain out of proportion to exam， paralysis， paresthesias， pallor， pulselessness. Sometimes poikilocytosis (coolness) is considered a sixth“P”.\n\n【21】RHABDOMYOLYSIS： Breakdown of muscle that leads to intravascular leakage of electrolytes and proteins， including myoglobin.\n\n【22】CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【23】Compartment syndrome results from an increase in tissue pressure within a confined fascial space that limits any expansion of the compartment's volume to compensate for the increase in pressure. As the pressure rises， the compartment's pressure eventually exceeds the capillary perfusion pressure， causing impaired oxygen delivery to tissue and subsequent tissue damage. Irreversible cellular damage， which results in breakdown of the intracellular organelles and cellular membranes， leads to leakage of intracellular electrolytes， including phosphorous， potassium， and myoglobin， as well as the activation of inflammatory cascades. This results in further swelling and tissue edema that， in turn， results in even further compartment pressure elevation. Rhabdomyolysis， the rapid breakdown of damaged muscle， may lead renal failure and dangerous electrolyte imbalances such as hyper-kalemia and hypocalcemia. Hyperkalemia relates directly to intracellular potassium leakage； hypocalcemia indirectly results from the release of phosphate ions that bind and sequester available calcium.\n\n【24】Although compartment syndrome exists in both acute and chronic forms， it is typically thought of as an acute process. For the purpose of this discussion， acute and chronic forms of this syndrome are discussed separately.\n\n【25】Acute Compartment Syndrome\n\n【26】Although compartment syndrome is frequently associated with closed fractures， par-ticularly comminuted fractures of the upper or lower extremities， it can be caused by any process that leads to impaired tissue perfusion. Additional causes of compart-ment syndrome include external compression such as constrictive casting， hema-tomas， arterial or venous thrombosis， intravenous (IV) infiltration， and leakage of fluid into the interstitial space . Although not common， improper positioning for surgical procedures (especially prolonged positioning in lithotomy or Trendelenburg positions) can lead to impaired venous return and subsequent com-partment syndrome.\n\n【27】The most common fractures associated with the development of compartment syndrome are closed tibial fractures， followed by forearm fractures. Some series\n\n| Table 13-1。CAUSES OF COMPARTMENT SYNDROME  |\n| --- |\n| Arterial and for venous obstruction Bleeding (especially in patients on anticoagulants) Circumferential burns Crush and other soft tissue injury Electrical burns Leakage of vascular catheters Intense exercise Intravenous drug injections Fractures Penetrating trauma Prolonged intraoperative positioning Prolonged immobility of a limb Reperfusion injuries Seizures Snake bites Constrictive dressings (casts， tight splints， military antishock trousers \\[MASTs\\])  |\n\n【29】report the incidence of compartment syndrome after closed tibia fractures to be approximately 20%. Physicians must be highly suspicious of compartment syndrome in the patient who develops increasing pain following closed reduction and immo-bilization. Significant pain with passive stretching of the toes (or fingers， in a fore-arm injury) should warrant removal of the cast or splint and careful reassessment for compartment syndrome.\n\n【30】Compartment syndrome is a clinical diagnosis based on signs and symptoms in the appropriate clinical setting. Although the syndrome is classically described by the“5 Ps\"， it is rare to find a patient who has all 5 (or 6 if you include coolness) 2.1 of these signs and symptoms. None of the “5 Ps\" are pathognomonic for this con-dition， and therefore diagnosis of compartment syndrome is primarily a clinical diagnosis. For example， pain， which typically represents the first clinical complaint， is extremely nonspecific. Pulselessness， which is a late finding and does not occur until the compartment pressures are significantly elevated， may be a baseline finding in patients with peripheral vascular disease. An additional physical exam finding that is frequently seen with compartment syndrome is pain on passive movement of the muscles within the effected compartment.\n\n【31】Confirmation of the diagnosis is made by directly measuring the compartment pres-sures using either a side-port needle or a slit catheter 删除33：<u></u>. Compartment pressures within 30 mmHg of the patient's diastolic blood pressure warrant emer-gency operative intervention. Although compartment pressure measurements are extremely useful in confirming the diagnosis of compartment syndrome， it is primar-ily a clinical diagnosis， and therefore measurement of compartment pressures should not delay surgical intervention if the clinical picture is clear. Additionally， many advocate for prophylactic intervention with fasciotomies to prevent the develop-ment of a compartment syndrome if there has been greater than 4 to 6 hours of limb ischemia.\n\n【32】Surgical intervention is performed via an operative fasciotomies.

This will sometimes require the use of skin grafts at a later date. In most cases， the fasciotomies are per-formed through 2 skin incisions that are positioned so that all fascial compartments can be decompressed. In the leg， fasciotomies involve releasing the anterior， lateral， superficial， posterior， and deep posterior compartments 删除33：<u></u>. Fasciotomies of the thigh involve release of the medial， anterior， and posterior compartments. In the arm， proximal fasciotomies involve releasing the anterior and posterior compart-ments， whereas forearm fasciotomies require opening the dorsal and volar compart-ments with extension into the carpal tunnel and mobile wad compartment located on the radial aspect of the forearm 删除33：<u></u>\nWhen performing fasciotomies， it is important to ensure that the fascial openings are long enough to fully decompress the muscle within. If the underlying injury is severe and the openings are inadequate， compartment syndrome can recur. Failure to appreci-ate this fact can easily lead to further tissue damage and subsequent complications.\n\n【33】The cellular damage that occurs from prolonged compartment syndrome leads to release of potassium， phosphorous， and myoglobin. Evaluation of the degree of muscle damage and breakdown can be followed with serial measurements of creatine phosphokinase (CPK)， which serves as an indirect gauge of the degree of myoglo-binemia. Myoglobin， the oxygen storing molecule of muscles， can crystallize within the renal tubules and lead to significant renal injury. Management of this severe myoglobulinemia primarily involves aggressive hydration with IV fluids with a goal of maintaining urine output of approximately 100 mL/hr or >1 mL/kg/hr. Some advocate for IV fluid supplementation with sodium bicarbonate with the goal of increasing the pH of urine and increasing the solubility of myoglobin to reduce crystallization and subsequent renal damage.\n\n【34】删除3：<u>Figure 13-2.

Depending on the degree of hyperkalemia， patients may require further medical interventions， including calcium chloride or calcium gluconate for myocardial protection as well as insulin/glucose， sodium bicarbonate， and poly-styrene sulfonate， a potassium binder.\n\n【36】Outcomes after the development of acute compartment syndrome are largely determined by the severity of the inciting injury， the timing of diagnosis， and the extent and severity of tissue damage. Although the majority of patients who sustain renal injury from rhabdomyolysis will eventually have a full recovery of renal func-tion， rhabdomyolysis complicated by acute kidney injury is associated with a mortal-ity rate as high as 20%. Furthermore， requirement for intensive care unit admission in the setting of rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury is associated with a mortal-ity rate reaching nearly 60%.\n\n【37】Chronic Compartment Syndrome\n\n【38】Although compartment syndrome is most commonly seen and discussed as an acute process， it can also exist in a chronic form. The chronic form of compartment syn-drome is an exercise-induced phenomenon that results in recurrent pain with activ-ity and relief with rest. The chronic form of this syndrome is not typically asso-ciated with significant muscle necrosis nor renal damage. A diagnosis of chronic compartment syndrome is confirmed by measuring intra-compartment pressures before and after exercise. Treatment options include surgical fasciotomies for pain relief and increased exercise tolerance， prolonged periods of rest in conjunction with modifying the offending activity or exercise routine， and continuing with current exercise routines despite the pain and discomfort that they cause. Those who elect to defer surgical intervention or lifestyle modification should be made aware that chronic compartment syndrome can on occasion develop into an acute compart-ment syndrome.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

You try to talk to Naomi about why she self-harms.\nNaomi is surprised, as no one has asked her this before.\n\n【2】Questions\n\n【3】• How should patients who self-harm be managed?\n\n【4】• What can be done to prevent a ‘revolving door’ system of hospital admissions?\n\n【5】ANSWER 53\n\n【6】Health and Social Care Information Centre data shows that the number of hospital admissions due to self-harm has risen from 16,417 in 2010 to 25,580 in 2014. The prevalence of selfharm is actually estimated to be much higher since many patients will not require medical  删除换行1 treatment for their injuries. Despite this the amount of government spending on adolescent  删除换行1 mental health has decreased. Self-harm is different from attempted suicide as there is no  删除换行1 desire to die. It is a phenomenon found mainly among 12–25-year-olds and is often an indication of underlying mental illness or emotional instability and is regarded as a maladaptive  删除换行1 coping mechanism. The tangible physical pain of self-harm is often easier to cope with than  删除换行1 emotional distress. Some of the reasons thought to be involved in the rise of self-harm are the  删除换行1 increased pressure on adolescents to fit in and succeed, the use of social media and constant  删除换行1 pressure to achieve good exam results.\n删除26：<u>!</u> Examples of self-harm include\n\n【7】• Cutting and scratching\n\n【8】• Burning and scalding\n\n【9】• Ingestion of toxic substances\nIt can be difficult to know how to help effectively young people who present to A&E or their  删除换行5 GP with self-inflicted wounds. Many injuries will be superficial and require only minimal  删除换行1 medical input, yet these patients will often become regular attendees at hospitals and will  删除换行1 undoubtedly benefit from psychological support.\n\n【10】There is a wide range of services across the UK for people who self-harm, but there is no  删除换行1 significant data on the efficacy of the different therapies. It is understood that good communication between the patient and their doctor is paramount in developing a rapport to ensure  删除换行1 that the patient feels comfortable engaging with ongoing support, which might include  删除换行1 psychological or psychiatric services. The patient should be encouraged to tell their family  删除换行1 and school teacher about the difficulties they are having with coping.\n\n【11】Health professionals need to have a greater understanding of the cause and prevalence of  删除换行1 self-harm to prevent a revolving door into A&E. Promoting trust between the doctor and  删除换行1 patient will enable individuals to feel valued and help them make autonomous decisions  删除换行1 regarding their own health. This in turn should make them feel more in control of their situation and emotions. Listening to them empathetically can help them feel that they are understood and so prevent the need to release their psychological pain through physical outlets.\nPeople who self-harm have a right to be treated with respect and not be discriminated against.\n\n【12】The report ‘Truth Hurts: The Report of the National Enquiry into Self Harm amongst \n\n【13】Young  People’ 通用删除7(英):<u>(2006)</u> recommended that health professionals should ‘re-connect to their  删除换行1 core professional skills and values: empathy, understanding, non-judgemental listening and  删除换行1 respect for individuals’.\n\n【14】Key Points\n\n【15】• Patients who self-harm need to be treated sensitively. They are vulnerable patients  删除换行1 who require understanding, confidentiality and care.\n\n【16】• Patients who self-harm are entitled to the same level of care for their physical  删除换行1 wounds as any other individual. Their refusal of psychological help should not  删除换行1 impact on provision of any other necessary treatment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

{"seq_id": "1f9fc81b-4f7e-420a-ae7b-53cafe6e690a", "title": null, "text": "【0】##### Determination of risk, risk/benefit ratio, and risk management\n\n【1】One of the principal obligations of IRBs is the determination of the level of risk posed to a participant and assuring that the risks are both acceptable and minimized by appropriate research design risk. This idea is frequently couched in the phrase risk/benefit ratio, which makes this determination sound like a calculation with a definable answer. Risk involves the expected value and likelihood of one or more future events. Unfortunately, the concept of risk is not defined in federal regulations and remains a particularly difficult concept to apply in the setting of human experimentation. Bioethicists, such a Ezekiel Emmanuel from the National Institutes of Health have argued for an actuarial definition of risk, based on the statistical likelihood of a an untoward occurrence. In this construct, human research is, for the most part, much safer than many daily human activities such a driving a car or participating in a contact sport such as football. On a practical basis, IRBs find themselves considering risk in a relation to a relative level of tolerance or acceptability. So, while the risk of driving a car is well understood, it is also generally acceptable in that very few individuals would consider not using an automobile based on the risk of death or injury, while a much lower absolute likelihood of injury or death in a biomedical research is not so well accepted.\n\n【2】The index case provides an interesting example. The cancer warning for the drug was established based on animal experiments of a related drug. There was no indication that the related drug actually did produce cancer in any humans and the actual drug in use was never tested for chronic use in animals, so the actual drug proposed for the study had never been reported to cause cancer. The warning was based on very little information and could arguably be dismissed from a scientific basis; however, failing to note the warning was clearly an error on the part of both the investigator and the review board. Any risk of cancer, no matter how small or theoretical, might be legitimately considered to be significant.\n\n【3】##### What is the IRB’s role in scientific review?\n\n【4】A frequent complaint leveled against current IRBs is the tendency to review the scientific design of a research proposal. Investigators argue, with some justification that scientific review occurs at other venues. Particularly for major grants, such as those funded by the National Institutes of Health, extensive review by panels of experts have critiqued the scientific content of the proposal. One could legitimately argue that IRBs, even with some direct expertise, are not as well equipped and provide little added value to previous professional scientific review. Even in the absence of this highly sophisticated professional review process, many institutions have internal scientific review bodies that can provide high quality review of the science underlying a proposal. These groups should be at least as good at evaluating the current standard of care and determining whether an experiment is justified and well designed.\n\n【5】High-quality scientific review should be extremely helpful to an IRB reviewing a project. A human subjects’ reviewer should be able to have confidence that a project reviewed and funded by an auspicious national body represents quality science. One might argue that a project prepared by a major pharmaceutical manufacturer who employs skilled personnel with extensive experience in research design is equally well designed. It is beneficial for these projects to have previous focused scientific review prior to submission to the IRB.\n\n【6】IRBs are supposed to minimize risk by ensuring appropriate research design. This is the standard justification used by most IRBs to question a study design. A number of circumstances arise. For major projects that have been reviewed, it may be that the contingencies of human subjects protections were not considered during the design or review of the project. For projects reviewed by the National Institutes of Health, this changed a few years ago, so that all projects including human subjects must now have a section describing human subjects protections. This change in the scientific review process has been a major improvement in scientific review that should minimize discrepancies seen in the past.\n\n【7】Even with this process, there may remain legitimate differences in the evaluation of a design. A poignant example has arisen in the latest rendition of the Declaration of Helsinki, which seeks to minimize the use of placebo controls. The supporters of this document contend that the use of placebos in rarely justified. For example, if a new analgesic was to be tested, one could argue that we don’t need one that is better than nothing, but rather one that is as good as or better than current therapy. Therefore, one should not design a trial that compares such a drug to placebo, but rather to an active standard of care control drug. Interestingly, the US FDA has rejected the current Declaration of Helsinki over this issue (among others) and continues to support and sometimes require placebo-controlled studies prior to approval of a new drug. IRBs frequently have a difficult time reconciling these different positions.\n\n【8】Furthermore, much research that is reviewed by IRBs has not undergone such extensive, if any peer review and might have been written by individuals with little experience is writing research proposals. These projects probably benefit from the expert reviews provided by an IRB. Much current science could be argued to be repetitive with little to be offered in terms of significant scientific progress. While major funding agencies require a project to be innovative and significant, the tremendous expansion of the medical literature has resulted in large numbers of scientific reports that do not have a major impact. Pharmaceutical companies are particularly interested in maintaining drugs on patent and are frequently accused of testing new articles with limited advantages over existing medications. For the most part, IRBs have been reluctant to take issue with well-designed research which promises minor scientific or medical value. Most IRB members would find that role unappealing and difficult to fulfill.\n\n【9】A difficult problem arises when poorly designed research poses minimal or no risk, but is unlikely to answer the proposed questions, due, for example, to a lack of proper controls or the inclusion of too few patients to achieve statistical significance. Some IRBs would argue that poor science represents an unacceptable risk, even if the primary “risk” involved is wasting the time of a participant. Others would argue that, in the absence of any definable risk of injury, for example, in an innocuous anonymous survey, the IRB is not justified in suggesting alterations to a project. Because the primary model ensconced in the regulations is based on significant clinical trials, it can be argued that applying these principles to minimal risk types of projects is either inappropriate or a waste of resources.通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>6 </sup></u> Although an ongoing problem, there is little appearance that this issue will be resolved at a federal level any time soon.\n\n【10】In the index case, there was no concern regarding the design. Had the information regarding the risk of the test substance been discussed at the initial review, the project most likely would still have been approved, although the information regarding this risk would have been discussed and included in the information provided to potential participants. In the age of the internet, where information is easily accessible, it is reasonable to question whether it is the responsibility of IRB reviewers to “go beyond” what the researcher supplies in order to do a thorough review. In the index case, this did not happen during the initial review, but did occur during subsequent review. It is hard to argue that IRBs should not be looking for this additional information, but it is also difficult to set standards for what should be reviewed.\n\n【11】##### New issues facing IRBs\n\n【12】IRB review is a continually evolving process. In recent years, issues of privacy and confidentiality have become major focuses of human subjects protections under the guise of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. Initially designed to avoid loss of insurance based on violations of privacy, the rules regarding privacy and confidentiality have proven daunting to review and enforce. Consent documents have expanded greatly to accommodate required language. Investigators have legitimately complained that the requirements are excessive and impair research activities. Balancing these concerns are the very real problems associated with identity loss and the concerns that private health information could be used to discriminate against individuals. IRBs have also become embroiled in the desire to minimize conflicts of interest in research. All of this activity has created an increasing burden for investigators, IRB members and human subjects protection program staff members. Fortunately, there seems to be a movement to simplify and streamline some of these review processes. One can only hope that we will achieve a balance of appropriate review and adequate protections which can be accomplished in an efficient and professional manner.\n\n【13】#### Key points\n\n【14】• Regulation of human subjects research has evolved in the wake of scandals involving mistreatment of human research subjects.\n\n【15】• Modern human subjects protections had their roots in the war crimes trials of German physicians who experimented on prisoners during World War II.\n\n【16】• Important early declarations regarding the ethical treatment of human research subjects include the Nuremberg Code, and the WMA Declaration of Helsinki.\n\n【17】• The description of the Tuskeegee Experiment was a watershed event in the history of US human research ethics, leading to the publication of the Belmont report elaborating the ethical principles in treatment of human subjects research.\n\n【18】• US IRBs have largely functioned as regulatory bodies assuring compliance with federal regulations.\n\n【19】• Determination of risks and assuring that risks are both acceptable and minimized is an important part of IRB review. Minimization of risk includes assurance of appropriate research design.\n\n【20】• Additional new issues facing IRBs include protection of the identities of human subjects, and the minimization of conflicts of interest in research.\n\n【21】####", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

What risks and complications are associated with hypokalaemia?\n通用删除5(英):<u>DOI: 10.1201/9781003242697-</u>\nANSWERS\n\n【21】The normal serum (extracellular) potassium ranges from 3.5 to 5.5 mM, with intake of  删除换行1 around 60 mmol equalling excretion by the cortical collecting duct of the kidneys (50 mmol) 删除换行1 and faeces (10 mmol). In the case of chronically impaired kidney function, the body adapts to  删除换行1 increase the excretion of potassium in faeces.\nThere are several causes of hypokalaemia, but fundamentally they result from three processes: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> reduced K+ intake, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> transcellular movement of K+ and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> increased K+ excretion. Movement of potassium from the extracellular to intracellular compartment is seen  删除换行1 with an alkalosis (K+ and H+ tend to move in opposite directions, so when H+ moves out of  删除换行1 cells to correct an alkalosis, K+ moves in), insulin treatment, use of β-agonists (hence why salbutamol can be used to treat hyperkalaemia) and in refeeding syndrome. Increased excretion  删除换行1 of potassium may occur via the kidneys (e.g. diuretics, diuretic phase of acute renal failure,  删除换行1 mineralocorticoid excess), or via extra-renal means (e.g. diarrhoea, vomiting, excess sweating, villous adenomas of the rectum).This patient’s hypokalaemia was most likely a result of vomiting, which caused excess loss  删除换行1 of potassium from gut contents. Other contributing factors could include antihypertensives  删除换行1 such as loop diuretics (e.g. furosemide), which inhibit potassium reabsorption via the Na+/  删除换行5 K+/2Cl− cotransporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. The patient was also  删除换行1 on insulin and salbutamol, which promote influx of potassium into cells through the Na/KATPase channel. The metabolic alkalosis also likely contributed.Hypokalaemia leads to hyperpolarisation of membranes, resulting in an impaired ability to fire action potentials. This may particularly affect the heart with risk of subsequent  删除换行1 arrhythmia. Indeed, ECG changes are observed with hypokalaemia, including ST depression, T wave depression or inversion, prolongation of the PR interval, and a prominent U  删除换行5 wave. Other consequences of hypokalaemia include constipation, ileus, rhabdomyolysis and  删除换行1 respiratory muscle weakness resulting in ventilatory failure in the most severe cases.

The patient also states that walking has become increasingly difficult although he attributes this to old age. Upon physical examination， the patient has increased muscle tone with a notably hunched posture and a resting tremor. When asked to make purposeful movements， the patient is slow to initiate the movement； however， the tremor is alleviated while moving. Examinations of cranial nerve function and deep tendon reflexes are normal. The patient shows no symptoms of dementia， Alzheimer， or any other cognitive disorders. An MRI is ordered which shows mild brain atrophy appropriate for his age， but otherwise unremarkable. You make the diagnosis of Parkinson disease.\n\n【2】What microscopic structures are found in the neurons of patients with this disorder?\n\n【3】What are the treatment options available?\n\n【4】ANSWERS TO CASE 25：\n\n【5】Summary： A 62-year-old man with bradykinesia and a steady resting tremor in both hands. His tremor is temporarily mitigated while making purposeful movements. The patient has increased muscle tone and a hunched posture. When asked to walk， the patient's gait is disturbed. Examinations of cranial nerve function and deep ten-don reflexes are normal. MRI reveals mild global brain atrophy appropriate for the patient's age but is otherwise normal.\n\n【6】Microscopic pathology： Lewy bodies are eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions with a halo of radial fibrils and are composed mainly of the protein alpha-synuclein. These pathological structures are thought to accumulate over time and disrupt normal intracellular functions of nerve cells.\n\n【7】Treatment options： While no current treatment options are curative， adminis-tration of levodopa (a precursor of dopamine) and other parkinsonism medica-tions help alleviate the symptoms of Parkinson disease. Some patients may also be candidates for neurosurgical interventions such as thalamotomy， subthal-amotomy， or pallidotomy procedures to alleviate movement symptoms once medical treatments have become ineffective. Also， current research shows that embryonic stem cell transplantation into the striatum may one day become an effective treatment option for patients with Parkinson disease.\n\n【8】Parkinson disease (PD) is a common neurological disorder of the basal ganglia aris-ing from neural cell degeneration within the pars compacta region of the substantia nigra. The loss of these pigmented dopaminergic neurons reduces the amount of dopamine synthesized by the substantia nigra. Without the appropriate amount of dopamine in the striatum， there is an antagonistic effect on the direct pathway and agonistic effect on the indirect pathway of the nigrostriatal projection. This often leads to hypokinesia. The direct pathway has the net effect of exciting thalamic neurons， which in turn make excitatory connections with cortical neurons. The indirect pathway has the net effect of inhibiting thalamic neurons， thereby inhibit-ing cortical neurons. The pathological cause of cell death in PD is still unclear， and the majority of cases are idiopathic. Other causes of parkinsonism are related to drug-induced， toxic， genetic， and traumatic etiologies. Parkinsonism symptoms are also observed in individuals after long-term use of antipsychotic medications such as haloperidol or after ingestion of the neurotoxin MPTP.\n\n【9】APPROACH TO：Basal Ganglia\n\n【10】OBJECTIVES\n\n【11】1\\. Know the anatomical structures and cellular projections of the basal ganglia.\n\n【12】2\\. Be able to describe the different neurological functions of the basal ganglia.\n\n【13】3\\. Know common disorders associated with the basal ganglia.\n\n【14】STRIATUM： The caudate nucleus and the putamen. Together， the two nuclei act as the “receiving portion\" of the basal ganglia.\n\n【15】PALLIDUM： Comprised of the internal (GP ) and external (GP) portion of the globus pallidus， the pallidum plays a modulatory role between the striatum and the thalamus. The efferent connections from the substantia nigra and the pallidum act as a mediator between the basal ganglia and the rest of the nervous system.\n\n【16】MEDIUM SPINY NEURONS：striatum. Contain the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA).\n\n【17】HEMIBALLISMUS： Involuntary， violent movements of the contralateral side of the body resulting from lesions involving the subthalamic nucleus.\n\n【18】CHOREA： A movement disorder of the basal ganglia characterized by a rapid， irregular flow of motions as well as grimacing movements of the face.\n\n【19】ATHETOSIS： A movement disorder of the basal ganglia characterized by slow， writhing movements of a wormlike character involving the extremities， trunk， and neck.\n\n【20】DISINHIBITION： Inhibition of an inhibiting projection pathway.\n\n【21】The basal ganglia are composed of the caudate nucleus， putamen， and globus pallidus. Because of the high degree of cellular connections with these three structures， the substantia nigra and subthalamic nucleus are also considered components of the basal ganglia. The basal ganglia have significant connections with both the thalamus and the cortex. It functions primarily in the modification and elaboration of movements initiated by the primary motor cortex. A lesion in one of the nuclei within the basal ganglia will therefore produce a disruption in movement and muscle tone but no pareses.\n\n【22】Other significant roles of the basal ganglia include cognitive functions such as verbal working memory， motor planning， repetitive movement learning， and the association of motivation and emotions to the execution of movements.\n\n【23】The caudate nucleus and the putamen together are termed the striatum. Together， these two nuclei act as the \"receiving portion”of the basal ganglia. The main afferent connections travel from the cerebral cortex， the intralaminar thalamic nuclei， and the dopamine-containing cell groups in the mesencephalon. The puta-men largely receives information from the primary motor and somatosensory cortex， while the caudate nucleus receives the majority of its inputs from the association areas of the cortex. The intralaminar thalamic nuclei project cells to the striatum in large part from the centromedian nucleus. The dopaminergic afferent connections of the striatum arise from the substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental area.\n\n【24】The primary efferent pathways from the basal ganglia begin in the globus pal-lidus and substantia nigra and project to the thalamus， mesencephalic tegmentum， and superior colliculus. The efferent connections from the substantia nigra and the pallidum act as a mediator between the basal ganglia and the rest of the nervous system.\n\n【25】The globus pallidus is composed of internal and external segments， each receiv-ing afferents input from the striatum and subthalamic nucleus. The actions of the striatal fibers on the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GP) are inhibitory while the effects from the subthalamic nucleus are excitatory. The activity of the GP is determined from the summation of inhibitory and excitatory input. The effer-ent output from the GP. acts on the substantia nigra and the thalamus. While the external portion of the globus pallidus (GP\\) projects to the subthalamic nucleus， the substantia nigra has efferent connections with the thalamus and superior col-liculus. The thalamus functions as a relay center for information projecting in both directions between the basal ganglia and the cerebral cortex. The basal ganglia additionally regulate muscle movements and tone through its efferent input to the reticulospinal tract and reticular formation. Six different cell types have been identified in the striatum， the most common of which are medium spiny neurons. These contain the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA.\n\n【26】The substantia nigra has two components： the pars compacta and the pars retic-ula. The pars compacta is densely packed with neuromelanin-containing neurons(giving the nucleus its dark color). The afferent connections of the substantia nigra come from many different cell groups， the majority being from the striatum. The inhibitory afferents of the substantia nigra contain the neurotransmitter GABA. Excitatory afferents originate from the pedunculopontine nucleus and subthalamic nucleus (transmitting glutamate)， the raphe nucleus (transmitting serotonin)， the locus coeruleus (transmitting norepinephrine)， and the basal forebrain.\n\n【27】The efferent connections of the substantia nigra primarily project to the stria-tum and thalamus， with some association to the superior colliculus and reticular formation 删除33：<u></u>. The pars compacta contains the dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons， making it a key location in PD. The nigrostriatal pathway has the dual effect of exciting the direct pathway and inhibiting the indirect pathway—when this pathway is destroyed in PD，the indirect pathway cannot be inhibited. The pars reticula contains inhibitory GABAergic nigrothalamic neurons.\n\n【28】Dopamine is one of the key modulatory neurotransmitters in the striatum. Dopamine receptors can be divided into D， and D， types， each of which possess many of their own subtypes. The receptors influence many types of ion channels\n\n【29】删除3：<u>Figure 25-1.

This allows the neurotransmitter to affect the stabilization of the membrane potential and contribute to keeping that potential in a range where the cell is apt to fire in bursts， that is， in a state suited for efficient signal transmission.</u>\n\n【30】Excitatory afferent connections are received from the motor cortex by the subthalamic nucleus. The subthalamic nucleus sends the majority of its efferent con-nections to the pars reticula and the globus pallidus. The effects of the subthalamo-pallidal efferents are excitatory. The excitatory influences of the striatum determine the activity of the GABA-containing neurons within the GP. The subthalamic nucleus is believed to control or stop ongoing movements. Because of the inhibitory effects that the GP has on the thalamocortical neurons， increased activity in the subthalamic nucleus would result in an inhibition of voluntary movement as a result of the inhibition of the motor cortex. The clinical presentation of hemiballismus， involuntary， violent movements of the contralateral side of the body resulting from lesions involving the subthalamic nucleus， may be because of increased activity of 删除换行1 the thalamocortical neurons. Several diseases have been linked to the basal ganglia. Parkinson disease is a neurodegenerative disorder of the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra. The disease is characterized by tremor， rigidity， akinesia， and postural instability. Current therapies for PD are limited to the treatment of the movement symptoms.\n\n【31】Huntington disease is an inherited disease that results from progressive neurode-generation of primarily GABAergic neurons within the striatum. It is characterized in its early stages by forgetfulness， depression， sudden falls， irritability， and chorei-form movements， which gradually progress until the patient is no longer ambulatory. In the late stages of the disease， continued cell deterioration eventually results in dementia. A locus for the disease has been identified on the short arm of chromo-some 4 allowing carriers of the disease to be identified before symptoms present. The disease is caused by a selective loss of striatal neurons in the indirect pathway. Without the inhibition from the indirect pathway， the thalamic neurons can fire spontaneously， causing the motor cortex to execute motor programs with no con-trol by the person. Tourette syndrome is a disorder involving a functional distur-bance between the basal ganglia and the frontal cortex. The syndrome presents with multiple tics， often associated with uncontrollable vocal outbursts. Patients with Tourette syndrome are often treated with dopamine antagonists to relive the motor symptoms. Tardive dyskinesia is an iatrogenic disorder that results from the long-term administration of neuroleptic medications such as haloperidol， chlorproma-zine， and thioridazine. The disorder is characterized by rigidity， and uncontrollable movements of the head， face， lips， and tongue. The symptoms are caused by sensi-tization of dopamine receptors in the mesolimbic pathway. This sensitization results in an imbalance in communication between the nigrostriatal pathway and the basal nuclear motor loop.\n删除13：<u>CASE CORRELATES\n删除25：<u>See Cases 24-27 (movement systems)， and cases 7 and 15 (Parkinson disease).</u>\n</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Ten days previously, he had needed an emergency visit. He had been  删除换行1 working in his garden and while twisting, lifting tree branches, he had experienced the sudden onset of severe lower back pain. He had collapsed to the ground but had managed to get  删除换行1 back into the house by crawling. He had taken painkillers and rested overnight, but on the  删除换行1 day of the visit, he had felt even worse. The GP had taken a history and examined the patient  删除换行1 and diagnosed simple lower back pain. He had reassured the patient, given a non-steroidal  删除换行1 anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) injection and prescribed more analgesia which had been  删除换行1 delivered by the chemist the same day. Now the patient reports that he is 99% back to normal  删除换行1 because of the ‘marvellous treatment’ that he received. He reminds the GP of the difficulties  删除换行1 that he had experienced finding his property, necessitating three phone calls on route asking  删除换行1 for directions: ‘You need some technical help finding your patients, doctor’. The patient asks  删除换行1 to have a repeat of his prescription items: ‘The shampoo and cream that you provided me  删除换行1 with has cleared my skin perfectly and my hay fever is so much better controlled this year’.\nLooking back at the records the GP sees that he had diagnosed the patient with seborrhoeic  删除换行1 dermatitis on a new patient check 2 months ago. He had prescribed antifungal creams and  删除换行1 shampoo and the patient’s condition had responded well. He remembered that the patient,  删除换行1 at that time, had given him an expensive aftershave as a sign of appreciation. On another  删除换行1 occasion, the GP had explained how to take the nasal steroid drops that were given to treat  删除换行1 the patient’s hay fever. He made a schematic drawing explaining the process. The patient  删除换行1 was surprised that he had not known how to take his long-standing treatment and was quite  删除换行1 taken with the drawing, requesting the GP to sign it: ‘You might become a famous artist in  删除换行1 the future’. Later, the patient had sent him aquarelle paper with coloured pastels. The GP had  删除换行1 felt uncomfortable accepting this generous gift, but his fellow doctors told him that he had  删除换行1 earned it. Three days later, the GP receives a parcel from his patient containing a state-of-theart satellite navigation system with a note from the patient: ‘Now you won’t get lost in the  删除换行1 country anymore’.\n\n【3】Questions\n\n【4】• Which guidelines governs the rules for doctors accepting gifts from patients?\n\n【5】• Why do patients offer gifts to doctors?\n\n【6】• Why might this GP feel uncomfortable accepting this gift?\n\n【7】ANSWER 42\n\n【8】The General Medical Council, in its document Good Medical Practice, provides clear  删除换行1 guidance to doctors about receiving gifts: ‘You must be honest and open in any financial  删除换行1 arrangements with patients. In particular, you … must not encourage patients to give, lend  删除换行1 or bequeath money or gifts that will directly or indirectly benefit you. You must not ask for or  删除换行1 accept any inducement gift or hospitality which may affect the way you prescribe for, treat  删除换行1 or refer patients’. Many trusts have procedures for their staff, regulating gifts from patients  删除换行1 by setting an acceptable upper value for gifts received and the way that the gifts must be  删除换行1 declared. Cash gifts are usually not acceptable and GPs are contractually obliged to keep a  删除换行1 register for gifts exceeding a value of £100.\n\n【9】Making a gift is a common socially acceptable way to show gratitude and appreciation. Most  删除换行1 doctors are given between one and five gifts per year and the most common items are chocolate and alcoholic beverages or other food items. This patient gave thoughtful, fitting and  删除换行1 humorous gifts. However, in this situation, the doctor and patient have not known each other  删除换行1 long, and it is worrying that the value of gifts seems to increase with each item. The patient  删除换行1 might perceive a friendship or may want to build a friendly relationship. His last gift might  删除换行1 be perceived as patronizing as most GPs have very good local knowledge of the practice area.\nOn the other hand, the GP might be afraid that rejecting this generous gift might upset his  删除换行1 patient endangering the development of a good patient–doctor relationship.\n\n【10】Doctors appreciate ‘thank you cards’ and small gifts. The cards can be used to provide evidence of good relationships with patients in annual appraisals. Larger gifts can feel less  删除换行1 comfortable. The doctor might fear that the patient is trying to build up an obligation allowing them in future to ask for special treatment in terms of access to services and prescriptions. Generous gifts or legacies might upset the donor’s family provoking complaints to the \n\n【11】General Medical Council.\n\n【12】Sometimes, doctors feel that they have not deserved a gift. This is especially true if they perceive that they have not provided the best normal services to the patient. Most doctors judge  删除换行1 whether it is right to accept a gift by the following rule: if the local newspaper published the  删除换行1 transaction would they feel ashamed or would their patients be upset? Many surgeries have a  删除换行1 league of friends that raises funds for their surgery. The money raised is commonly used for  删除换行1 buying additional medical equipment or improving areas for patient use, for example buying  删除换行1 toys or providing a TV for the waiting room.\n\n【13】• Gifts from patients are common and a socially acceptable way of showing appreciation for the doctor’s good work.\n\n【14】• Doctors should be mindful when they accept generous gifts from patients.\n删除12：<u>Key Points87\n\n【15】删除29：<u>Case 43: Gynaecomastia</u>\n\n【16】</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

One of the most common situations is when a temporary canine falls out as a consequence of the distal eruption of the lateral incisor. The lower incisors erupt without apparent crowding, but as a result the midline is shifted to this side.\n\n【31】The controversy is when the best time to begin the treatment is to avoid major problems such as the mesialization of the posterior teeth in combination with the distalization of the anterior with the consequent loss of space for the permanent canines and bicuspids.\n\n【32】A guided eruption protocol would be the best option according to the individual facial biotype and quantity of growth.

He is currently experiencing typical chest pain symptoms with heavy exertion， and these symptoms have been stable for the last 3 years. He denies chest pain at rest， worsening of his angina over the last 3 months， and has no symptoms suggestive of congestive heart failure. He has a known history of coronary artery disease and is on aspirin， a long-acting beta-blocker， simvastatin， and hydrochlorothiazide. His physical examination is unremarkable， and he does not smoke or drink alcohol. The patient has a normal resting ECG and is able to exercise.

Appreciate the role of noninvasive stress testing， coronary angiography， opti-mal medical therapy， and percutaneous or surgical revascularization in chronic stable angina.\n\n【16】Considerations\n\n【17】This 68-year-old man has typical anginal chest pain， and has known coronary artery disease. His angina is stable， and evident only with significant exertion. Importantly， his history and physical findings do not suggest the presence of an acute coronary syndrome (such as unstable angina or acute MI) or significant left ventricular dys-function. The resting 12-lead ECG is normal， and he is on an appropriate pharmaco-logical regimen for stable coronary heart disease. The first diagnostic step in this case would be to evaluate whether he requires more aggressive risk factor modification by 删除换行1 measuring serum total cholesterol， LDL， HDL， creatinine， and blood glucose levels. The patient's blood pressure is not currently adequately controlled， and in addition to increasing the doses of his antihypertensive medications， he should be encour-aged to adopt lifestyle modifications to reduce his blood pressure to <140/90mmHg. He is already on a diuretic and a beta-blocker， and a third agent may be necessary to achieve the target blood pressure. An angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor(ACEI) or an angiotensin receptor blocker should be introduced preferentially. In addition， the beta-blocker dose can be slowly titrated to target a resting heart rate between 60 and 70 bpm， which may further improve his angina symptoms. Sub-sequent to this， the patient should be referred for exercise ECG stress testing to establish his risk for future nonfatal myocardial infarction or death from cardiovas-cular causes. Several risk indices factor in results from exercise stress testing or other noninvasive modalities， and those patients with high-risk findings should be consid-ered for percutaneous or surgical revascularization if a high-risk epicardial coronary lesion is identified on coronary angiography. Barring features suggestive of high risk for future complications， studies have shown that optimal medical therapy alone is as effective as optimal medical therapy plus percutaneous coronary intervention.\n\n【18】APPROACH TO：\n\n【19】The Patient with Stable Angina\n\n【20】DEFINITIONS\n\n【21】STABLE ANGINA： Typically retrosternal heaviness， pressure， or squeezing pain that occurs with activity and resolves promptly with rest or administration of nitroglycerin.\n\n【22】ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME (ACS)： A spectrum of clinical entities that represent the end result of acute myocardial ischemia， typically the result of acute occlusion of an epicardial coronary artery due to vasospasm or atherogenic plaque rupture and thrombosis.\n\n【23】UNSTABLE ANGINA (UA)： Part of the spectrum of the acute coronary syn-drome. UA includes recent-onset angina (within 2 months of presentation)， rest， crescendo or prolonged angina， and angina not promptly relieved by nitroglycerin.\n\n【24】CUNICAL APPROACH\n\n【25】Etiologies\n\n【26】The differential diagnosis of chest pain consists of clinical entities that can be chronic and relatively benign， or acute and imminently life-threatening. Exclud-ing those diagnoses that present an immediate threat to the life of the patient is the first task of the clinician. The 12-lead ECG is paramount for the diagnosis of an acute coronary syndrome and can direct patient management decisions rapidly. If acute aortic disease is a consideration， chest x-ray or CT imaging， evaluation of peripheral pulses， and blood pressure measurements in both arms should be under-taken.Other diagnoses to be considered include pneumothorax， pericarditis， pulmo-nary embolus， and esophageal perforation.\n\n| Table 4-1·CHARACTERIZATION OF CHEST PAIN AS TYPICAL， ATYPICAL  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |\n| ORNONANGINAL ACCORDING TO KEY CLINICAL FEATURES  |  |  |  |\n| Features  | Provocative Factors  |  | Relieving Factors  |\n| d iffuse substernal location\"d ull， pressurelike quality， 5-30-minute duration  | Physical exertion Emotional distress  |  | Rest or relaxationNitroglycerin  |\n| Typical chest pain  |  | All three of the above  |  |\n| Atypical chest pain  |  | Any two of the above  |  |\n| Nonanginal chest pain  |  | One or none of the above  |  |\n\n【28】Pain that radiates to the neck or jaws is strongly suggestive of angina.\n\n【29】Clinical Presentation\n\n【30】History The classic presenting complaint in patients with stable coronary heart dis-ease is exertional chest discomfort. This is most frequently described as a retrosternal pressure or squeezing sensation， with occasional radiation to the jaw or the upper extremities. Prompt relief of pain with nitrates or on cessation of exertion supports the diagnosis . On the basis of the patient's age and gender， the classi-fcation of chest pain as typical， atypical， or noncardiac can predict the likelihood of angiographic coronary stenosis with fair accuracy . In cases of severe or high-risk CAD， symptoms related to left ventricular dysfunction or conduction system abnormalities may be apparent. These include dyspnea on exertion， orthop-nea， paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea， lower extremity edema， palpitations， and syn-cope or near-syncope. Finally， it is critical to note historical features suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome， including crescendo angina， rest angina， and angina not promptly relieved by rest or nitroglycerin.\n\n【31】Physical Examination Often， the cardiac exam is unrevealing， but fndings sug-gestive of left ventricular dysfunction， such as sinus tachycardia， pulmonary rales， elevated jugular venous pulsation， lower extremity edema， and new cardiac mur-murs， are signifcant.\n\n| Table 4-2·PRETEST LIKELHOOD (%) FOR ANGIOGRAPHICALLY  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| SIGNIFICANT CORONARY ARTERY STENOSISBASED ON AGE  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| GENDER AND CHARACTERIZATION OF CHEST PAIN  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Nonanginal  |  | Atypical  |  | Typical  |  |  |\n| Age (years)  | Men  | Women  | Men  | Women  | Men  | Women  |  |\n| 30-39  | 5  | 1  | 22  | 4  | 70  | 26  |  |\n| 40-49  | 14  | 3  | 46  | 13  | 87  | 55  |  |\n| 50-59  | 22  | 8  | 59  | 32  | 92  | 79  |  |\n| 60-69  | 28  | 19  | 67  | 54  | 94  | 91  |  |\n\n【33】Angiographically signifcant stenosis defned as > 50% stenosis. 删除10：<u>删除21：<u>Adapted from Diamond GA， Forrester JS.N EnglJMed. 1979；300：1350-1358.)</u></u>\nTREATMENTOF CAD\n\n【34】Risk Factor Modification\n\n【35】Identify and treat dyslipidemia， with a goal LDL of <100 mg/dL if coronary disease has been established or if the 10-year risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) is estimated to be>20%， with an optional LDL-C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol)： goal of <70 mg/dL.

It is important to titrate medications to maximally tolerated dosages. In refractory cases ranolazine and enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP) can be considered. EECP involves hour-long sessions of sequential balloon counterpul-sation therapy with large pneumatic cuffs that are placed on the legs. Patients are typically treated 5 days per week for a 7-week session. Adjunctive therapies such as ranolazine and EECP have been shown to reduce symptom frequency， nitroglycerin usage， and the degree of ST segment depression with exercise， but these modali-ties have not been shown to impact survival or “hard events\" such as the rate of myocardial infarction. Patients with refractory symptoms despite optimal medical therapy and coronary anatomy that is not conducive to revascularization may even be referred for spinal cord stimulation to address their chest pains.\n\n【38】NONINvASIv E Ev ALUATION OF RISKAND PROGNOSIS\n\n【39】Noninvasive stress testing and advanced imaging can provide additional data con-cerning risk and prognosis in patients with stable ischemic heart disease. In patients with an interpretable resting electrocardiogram who can exercise， exercise ECG stress testing is considered a class 1 indication according to the joint American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines. Exer-cise is generally the preferred stressor because it provides additional information concerning the functional capacity of the patient. The Duke treadmill score (DTS) is commonly used as a risk prediction tool， and has been shown to be a reliable risk index across a large spectrum of patient populations .

This disease is seen in children and on the lower legs of older men. Schamberg’s disease presents as lesions that are irregular patches red and brown in color with superimposed pinpoint cayenne pepper macules. The discoloration is due to the leakage of blood from small blood vessels near the skin surface. The red lesions are newer hemorrhages and the older lesions are brown from the hemosiderin deposits from the degradation of the extravascular erythrocytes. Sometimes the lesions can cause itching and discomfort 删除10：<u>(Ball et al. 2003 ; Bolognia et al. 2003 )</u>.\n\n【32】There are several other types of pigmented purpuric ­dermatoses. Majocchi’s disease is an annular variant that has telangiectasias. Gougerot-Blum disease has lesions of Schamberg’s disease along with lichenoid papules, plaques, and macules. Lichen aureus has few patches that are rust colored, purple, or golden which arise from the extremities or from the trunk 删除10：<u>(Johnson et al. 2005 )</u>.\n\n【33】Stasis dermatitis is a chronic venous insufficiency disease that causes peripheral edema, hyperpigmentation, fibrosis of the skin and subcutaneous tissue, and ulceration. Stasis dermatitis treatment options include elevation of the legs, the use of support hose, and topical corticosteroid medications. This patient’s heart attack likely contributed to the addition of stasis dermatitis superimposed on his diagnosis of Schamberg’s disease.\n\n【34】Key Points\n----------\n\n【35】   Progressive pigmented eruptions are benign rashes caused by capillaritis.\n   Several clinical variants exist.

The emergency medicine physician on duty conducts an evaluation, initiates treatment, and plans to admit the patient when he fails to show significant improvement after 2 hours. You receive a phone call at home informing you that the patient is being admitted and that you need to come in to the hospital to further assess and treat the patient. You state that you have no obligation to come into the hospital and explain that because the patient will not comply with your treatment recommendations, you had planned on terminating your physician–patient relationship.\n\n【3】 Are you ethically or legally obligated to come in and admit the patient?\n\n【4】 What are the consequences of your failure to admit the patient?\n\n【5】### ANSWERS TO CASE 10:\n\n【6】#### Patient Abandonment\n\n【7】Summary: A 57-year-old man with exacerbation of COPD requires admission to the hospital, but you do not wish to provide any further care and treatment for this patient. You would like to terminate your physician–patient relationship due to the patient’s continued noncompliance with your medical recommendations.\n\n【8】 Are you ethically or legally obligated to come in and admit the patient : Yes, you are obligated because you have not formally terminated the physician–patient relationship and you still have a duty to the patient.\n\n【9】 Consequences of failing to admit patient : You will have abandoned the patient.\n\n【10】### ANALYSIS\n\n【11】##### Objectives\n\n【12】1\\. Understand when a physician–patient relationship is formed.\n\n【13】2\\. Describe a process for termination of the physician–patient relationship.\n\n【14】3\\. Define patient abandonment and describe a clinical situation in which a physician has abandoned a patient.\n\n【15】##### Considerations\n\n【16】Failure of a patient to comply with recommended medical treatment can be grounds for discontinuation of the physician–patient relationship; however, processes must be followed to ensure that the discontinuation of the relationship does not result in patient abandonment. In the scenario described, the physician has not taken the necessary steps to formally discontinue the physician–patient relationship; thus, he or she still has a duty to provide care for the patient. Failure to fulfill those obligations is equivalent to patient abandonment, which has negative legal, hospital, and state medical board consequences.\n\n【17】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【18】#### Discontinuation of the Physician–Patient Relationship\n\n【19】### DEFINITION\n\n【20】PATIENT ABANDONMENT : Failure to provide appropriate care and treatment for a patient prior to the proper termination of the physician–patient relationship.\n\n【21】### CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【22】##### Ethical Considerations\n\n【23】In professional medical ethics, the relationship between a physician and patient is asymmetrical. The physician has more demanding obligations to the patient than the patient has to the physician. In addition, although patients should be prudent and implement agreed-upon plans for self-care, some patients will be imprudent. This behavior may be voluntary or involuntary, a clinical distinction that can often be challenging to make.\n\n【24】The ethical asymmetry of the professional physician–patient relationship means that the physician bears the burden of proof to end the relationship without the patient’s agreement. In this respect the professional relationship with a patient is not contractual; the distinction is important, because failure of one party to keep one’s agreement is grounds for voiding a contract. The physician continues to have obligations despite the patient’s behavior.\n\n【25】The most fundamental ethical obligation of a physician is to see to it that his or her patients receive appropriate, timely, and effective clinical management of their conditions, diseases, or injuries. The physician either attends to this care himself or herself or via referral when the skill level required to meet the patient’s clinical needs exceed those of the physician. This ethical obligation requires that the ending of the professional relationship without the agreement of the patient does not disrupt the patient’s care and thus violate the physician’s obligation to protect the patient’s health-related interests. These ethical requirements shape the law of abandonment.\n\n【26】##### Legal Considerations\n\n【27】Once a physician–patient relationship is established, the physician is obligated to continue treatment of the patient until such a time as the relationship is terminated. Some common reasons a physician may terminate the relationship with a patient include failure to pay for services rendered, failure to comply with prescribed treatment, difficult/demanding patients, and repeated failure to appear for appointments.\n\n【28】In general, a physician–patient relationship may be terminated in 1 of 3 ways: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> agreement of the patient and the physician to terminate the relationship (eg, the patient is moving out of state and the treating physician helps the patient locate a new doctor), 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> a unilateral act by the patient without involvement of the physician (eg, requesting medical records for transfer to another practice), or 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> a unilateral act by the physician (eg, sending the patient a termination letter). To avoid the accusation of patient abandonment, it is necessary to follow a series of steps to formally terminate the physician–patient relationship, even though it might seem as if the patient unilaterally terminated the relationship by engaging in certain behaviors such as refusing to pay their medical bill. The amount of time a patient is given to find alternative care must be reasonable based on factors such as availability of providers and the severity of the patient’s condition. One approach to termination of the physician–patient relationship is presented in Table 10–1 .\n删除4：<u>Table 10–1 • RECOMMENDED APPROACH TO TERMINATION OF THE PHYSICIAN–PATIENT RELATIONSHIP</u>\n\n【29】1\\.

Recount the salient points from the termination discussion.\n\n【32】b. Provide the reason for termination.\n\n【33】c. Indicate a termination date.\n\n【34】d. Explain physician availability for emergencies until the termination date.\n\n【35】e. Inform the patient that names of other potential treating physicians can be provided.\n\n【36】f.

As many as 30% of patients may have frank diabetes, and a similar percentage have impaired glucose tolerance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 30 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Pituitary surgery resulting in normalization of IGF-1 has been shown to normalize HbA1c in almost 50% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 32 \\]</u>. In those in whom diabetes persists, treatment is accepted to be the same as for type 2 diabetes in general – lowering HbA1c while avoiding hypoglycemia – and metformin is the usual first-line drug therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Until recently, a sulfonylurea or insulin has been the most common additional treatment, but the availability of antihyperglycemic agents that reduce cardiovascular risk and at the same time are less likely to cause hypoglycemia, brings a new dimension. GLP-1 receptor agonists have been shown to decrease cardiovascular risk in the general diabetes population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 33 , 34 \\]</u> and would seem to be a logical second-line therapy in acromegalic patients, though we know of no published studies supporting this. Sodium glucose co-transporter inhibitors (SGLT-2i) have also been shown to decrease cardiovascular risk in diabetes, but caution is required in acromegaly because of risk of inducing diabetic ketoacidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 35 , 36 \\]</u>. The increased availability of free fatty acids in acromegaly likely plays a pathophysiologic role in this.\n\n【3】The medical treatment of persistent elevation of GH and IGF-1 following surgery is another factor that can influence diabetes. SLRs will generally be expected to have little effect on glycemic control, since the potential benefit of decreased insulin resistance as GH levels decrease may be counterbalanced by suppression of insulin secretion. Fasting glucose and HbA1c levels are generally unchanged, but postprandial glucose may increase 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 37 \\]</u>. Occasionally however, with octreotide or lanreotide, glycemic control can worsen, so careful glucose monitoring is advisable.\n\n【4】Pasireotide , a multi-receptor-targeted somatostatin analogue, with greatly increased binding affinity for the somatostatin receptor subtype 5 (SSTR5) compared to octreotide, has been shown to decrease GH and IGF-1 more effectively, but at the potential cost of inducing hyperglycemia and worsening glycemic control in patients with diabetes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 38 \\]</u>. Baseline glucose, older age, and features of metabolic syndrome such as hypertension and dyslipidemia are predictive of the likely development of hyperglycemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 38 , 39 \\]</u>. The likely mechanism is the greater binding affinity to SSTR5 than to SSTR2; both of these receptor subtypes are found on the insulin-secreting beta cells of the pancreatic islets, while SSTR2 predominates on the glucagon-secreting alpha cells. There also is inhibition of incretin secretion by pasireotide. Therefore, insulin secretion is negatively impacted to a much greater degree than glucagon, a hormone antagonistic to insulin, resulting in hyperglycemia. Careful consideration therefore is required when weighing the potential benefits of pasireotide treatment in acromegaly against the potential hyperglycemic risk, particularly in those patients with metabolic syndrome.\n\n【5】The GH receptor antagonist pegvisomant , on the other hand, has been shown to be associated with improvement in glycemic control 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 40 , 41 \\]</u>. One study showed a decrease in HbA1c of >1.0% in patients with acromegaly and diabetes during 6 months of pegvisomant treatment. The mechanism is felt to be increased insulin sensitivity due to decreased activation of GH receptors. Higher doses of pegvisomant are typically required to normalize IGF-1 in patients with diabetes than in those without. The reason for this may be that the hyperinsulinism associated with type 2 diabetes and treatment with insulin will increase the number of GH receptors on the hepatocytes and hence also liver sensitivity to GH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 42 \\]</u>. Fasting glucose and HbA1c may decrease after addition of pegvisomant to octreotide or lanreotide treatment. However, in a study of combination treatment (pegvisomant plus SSA), fasting glucose and HbA1c increased over a 12-week period when pasireotide was substituted for either octreotide or lanreotide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 43 \\]</u>.\n\n【6】A recent consensus statement suggested that all acromegalic patients should be screened for dysglycemia at diagnosis, with continuing monitoring during follow-up, and that treatment of hyperglycemia is essential for optimal outcome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【7】Dyslipidemia\n------------\n\n【8】Several studies have demonstrated that dyslipidemia is common in patients with active acromegaly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 44 , 45 \\]</u>. Increases in total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, VLDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, and lipoprotein(a) and decreased HDL-cholesterol in comparison to control populations have all been described, with perhaps hypertriglyceridemia and increased lipoprotein(a) being the most common. Controlling acromegaly – normalizing IGF-1 – may restore these abnormalities to normal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 46 \\]</u>.\n\n【9】Recent endocrine society guidelines have endorsed the need to measure lipid profile before and after treatment of acromegaly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 47 \\]</u>. For persistent dyslipidemia in acromegaly, the use of statin drugs has been shown to be effective in improving the lipid profile 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 48 \\]</u>. We would suggest that the aim should be to reduce LDL-cholesterol to <70 mg/dL, as is the case in patients with diabetes.\n\n【10】In our case, diagnosis of hyperlipidemia was made approximately a year before the diagnosis of acromegaly, when treatment with atorvastatin 40 mg was started. The LDL-C had an excellent response to atorvastatin which was continued after transsphenoidal surgery and maintained LDL-cholesterol just above 70 mg/dL. HbA1c, while not normal, has not been in the diabetes range and did not change after surgery. Fasting glucose decreased to within the normal range. He has not been treated with any antihyperglycemic agent.\n\n【11】Sleep Apnea\n-----------\n\n【12】Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a condition that affects 20–80% of patients with acromegaly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 49 , 50 \\]</u>. Most of the cases, about two thirds, are due to the obstructive form where patients with acromegaly may develop soft tissue swelling of the airways and changes in the craniofacial bones. The remaining one third of cases are due to central sleep apnea where brain control of respiration is affected by elevated GH and IGF-1 levels. People with sleep apnea are at increased risk of hypertension and stroke 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 51 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】A recent meta-analysis found that the apnea hypopnea index (AHI) in patients with acromegaly and OSA did improve after short-term treatment of GH excess in longitudinal studies. However, overall, the prevalence of OSA and the AHI were not significantly different between patients with active and inactive disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 52 \\]</u>. It is possible that changes to the upper respiratory airways may not be fully reversible and may account for this finding. Other comorbidities that develop during the course of acromegaly such as obesity, heart failure, type 2 diabetes, and arrhythmias may also contribute.\n\n【14】Hypopituitarism\n---------------\n\n【15】Patients with acromegaly who present with macroadenomas may have hypopituitarism.\n\n【16】The rate of hypopituitarism following surgical resection for the treatment of acromegaly was found to be 12.79% (95% CI 9.88–16.00%) in a meta- analysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 53 \\]</u>. The rate of hypopituitarism following radiation is approximately 40% in the first 10 years. The most common deficiency is of gonadotropins followed by corticotropin and then thyroid stimulating hormone deficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 54 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】The mainstay of treatment of hypopituitarism is replacement of the deficient hormones which can impact the cardiometabolic risk factors. There is potential for over-treatment of adrenal insufficiency with glucocorticoids. It has been recognized that patients continue to experience increased rates of morbidity and premature mortality due to non-physiological and glucocorticoid over treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 55 , 56 \\]</u>. Modified-release hydrocortisone formulations have recently been developed as cortisol replacement therapy which may help ameliorate these effects. In contrast, insufficient thyroid hormone replacement may contribute to dyslipidemia and increased cardiovascular risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 57 \\]</u>. Low testosterone levels may be associated with dyslipidemia and other markers of increased cardiovascular risk, such as hypertension and increased inflammatory markers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 58 \\]</u>. Yet, there continues to be controversy over whether or not testosterone therapy may increase cardiovascular risk. This is probably due to the increasing use of testosterone in aging men in the absence of pituitary or gonadal disease.\n\n【18】In our case, after pituitary surgery and treatment with a long-acting somatostatin receptor ligand, his sleep apnea resolved. Periodic monitoring of free T4, testosterone, as well as cortisol levels was continued to ensure appropriate replacement and to determine whether ACTH deficiency occurs as a result of radiation. In addition, metabolic and cardiovascular parameters are being closely followed.\n\n【19】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【20】The concept that acromegaly increases cardiometabolic risk has been well established. Attention to all aspects of the condition is necessary to try to eliminate the risk. We believe that efforts to reduce the delay in diagnosis of acromegaly would constitute the single most beneficial step forward so that the cascade of factors contributing to increased cardiometabolic risk could be mitigated.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

They also noted that his abdomen seemed to be enlarged. Examination reveals an enlarged spleen. Further history reveals that he has been taking vitamins and iron supplements over the last few months. Laboratory tests show a microcytic anemia and elevated iron levels in tissues. Which of the following conditions is most consistent with the findings in this patient?\n\n【1】A. Aplastic anemia\n\n【2】B. Cooley anemia\n\n【3】C. Pernicious anemia\n\n【4】D. Thalassemia major\n\n【5】E. Thalassemia minor\n\n【6】Answer: 12.1 E. The correct diagnosis is thalassemia minor because the patient had been asymptomatic until the age of 7 years. If he had thalassemia major or Cooley anemia, then he would have exhibited symptoms as early as his first birthday. Pernicious anemia leads to a macrocytic or megaloblastic anemia, whereas aplastic anemia is characterized by normal sized erythrocytes.\n\n【7】Question: 12.2 After diagnosing the patient in question 12.1 and ascertaining that he is not agranulocytic, his physician prescribes subcutaneous infusion of deferoxamine, an iron chelator, and monitors him for several weeks. What is his condition most likely to be on reexamination?\n\n【8】A. Iron levels decrease, but he remains anemic.\n\n【9】B. Iron levels decrease, and anemia recovers.\n\n【10】C. He develops irreversible and severe agranulocytosis.\n\n【11】D. Iron and vitamin C levels decrease.\n\n【12】Answer: 12.2 A. The iron chelator helps in excreting iron but has no role in increasing red blood cell production to counteract anemia.\n\n【13】Question: 12.3 An electrophoretic analysis of Hb level in the patient in questions 12.1 and 12.2 indicates that, although there is a decrease in the relative amount of the β-chain with respect to the α-chain, both the β- and the α-chains migrate at the same position as normal chains. His anemia is most likely caused by which of the following?\n\n【14】A. Defect in an enzyme involved in heme synthesis\n\n【15】B. Point mutation in the coding region of the gene coding for the β-chain\n\n【16】C. Frameshift mutation in the coding region of the gene coding for the β-chain\n\n【17】D. Mutation in the promoter of the β-chain gene\n\n【18】E. Mutation in the structural gene of the β-chain\n\n【19】Answer: 12.3 D. Because the β-chain is decreased with respect to the α-chain, it is most likely that there is a mutation that decreases the expression of the β-chain gene, in which a mutation in the promoter region could result. A point mutation in the β-chain leading to an amino acid substitution could lead to changes in electrophoretic mobility but would not alter the levels of expression. A frameshift mutation in the β-chain would result in decreased β-chain on the electrophoregram.\n\n【20】Question: 12.4 As a medical geneticist, you analyze the DNA of the patient from question 12.1 and find that he is homozygous for thalassemia.

Mom Talltwin is homozygous and Dad Talltwin is normal.\n\n【25】E. Both Mom and Dad Talltwin are carriers of the disease.\nAnswer: 12.4 E. Thalassemia is autosomal recessive; therefore, Micawley Talltwin can get the disease only if both the parents were to be heterozygotes (or a carrier) of that particular trait.\n\n【26】BIOCHEMISTRY PEARLS\n\n【27】 The thalassemias are characterized by the absence or reduced synthesis of 1 or more of the 4 globin chains of Hb.\n\n【28】 Thalassemias are named according to the affected globin chain; thus, a disorder of the α-chain would be an α-thalassemia and a disorder of the β-chain would be a β-thalassemia.\n\n【29】 The ARMS is a technique in which the target DNA is amplified using a common primer and either mutation specific primer for β-thalassemia or the correct sequence primer to the target.\n\n【30】 PCR restriction enzyme analysis takes advantage of the occurrence of approximately 40 β-thalassemia mutations that either introduce or remove a restriction endonuclease site.\n\n【31】 Radio-labeled single stranded DNA oligonucleotide probes are allowed to anneal with the target strand in an oligonucleotide hybridization analyses .\n\n【32】 With 1 common mutation, a very successful and efficient hybridization analysis is the PCR allele-specific oligonucleotide assay .

{"seq_id": "8e82704f-129c-4af9-b400-f53fcdeab674", "title": null, "text": "【0】### Part 2. Antiviral Agents\n\n【1】The 3 major classes of antiviral agents are DNA polymerase inhibitors, reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and protease inhibitors. It should be noted that HIV treatment usually includes the use of at least 2 reverse transcriptase inhibitors and 1 protease inhibitor. DNA polymerase inhibitors are subdivided into nucleoside and nonnucleoside. Drugs may target viral nucleic acid replication such as DNA polymerase either via nucleoside (purine or pyrimidine analogs) such as acyclovir or ribavirin, or by attacking a unique viral process needed in nucleic acid synthesis such as viral pyrophosphate (nonnucleoside type). Antiviral drugs used to treat herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection can be classified as either nucleosides or non-nucleosides, or according to their site of action in the viral replicative cycle, or according to their clinical use.\n\n【2】### COMMON ANTIVIRAL AGENTS\n\n【3】Influenza\n\n【4】Amantadine and rimantadine are primarily used against infections caused by the influenza A virus. Their mechanism of action is interfering with viral uncoating. Both agents are fairly well absorbed orally and cause some minor central nervous system (CNS) effects (rimantadine less so) and minor gastrointestinal (GI) effects .\n\n【5】Table II-4 • PARTIAL LISTING OF ANTIVIRAL MEDICATIONS\n\n【6】### HERPES VIRUS\n\n【7】Acyclovir is used against HSV types 1 and 2. Acyclovir, a nucleoside DNA polymerase inhibitor, is a deoxyguanosine triphosphate analog, which is incorporated into the viral DNA and causes DNA chain termination. Its specificity is a result of the presence of herpes-specific thymidine kinase in infected cells, which phosphorylates acyclovir 100 times more efficiently than by uninfected cells. Acyclovir can be topically used, orally for recurrent genital herpes, and intravenously for immunocompromised patients or herpes encephalitis. Its adverse effects include headache, nausea, and rarely nephrotoxicity with intravenous use. Valacyclovir is an analog of acyclovir and is converted to acyclovir in the body. Its advantage is better bioavailability. See Table II-5 for listing of agents against herpes viruses.\n\n【8】Table II-5 • AGENTS USED TO TREAT HERPES VIRUS INFECTIONS (ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION)\n\n【9】Penciclovir is converted to the triphosphate form and inhibits viral DNA polymerase. Famciclovir is converted to the active agent penciclovir in the body. Penciclovir is used topically to treat herpes labialis “cold sores”; famciclovir is used for genital herpes or herpes zoster. Headache and GI effects are common. Ganciclovir is structurally similar to acyclovir and must be converted to the triphosphate form to be active; it competes with deoxyguanosine triphosphate for incorporation into viral DNA, thereby inhibiting DNA polymerase. Its primary role is against CMV and is far more effective than acyclovir. Ganciclovir can induce serious myelosuppression.\n\n【10】Foscarnet is a synthetic nonnucleoside analog of pyrophosphate and inhibits DNA polymerase or HIV reverse transcriptase by directly binding to the pyrophosphate-binding site. Its use is usually for acyclovir resistant herpes or CMV retinitis. Significant nephrotoxicity may occur with its use.\n\n【11】Sorivudine is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog and, on being converted to the triphosphate form, is active against herpes DNA synthesis. It is effective against VZV and is usually well tolerated. Idoxuridine is an iodinated thymidine analog, which inhibits herpes DNA synthesis in its triphosphate form. It is used primarily topically for herpes keratitis. Adverse effects include pain and inflammation. Vidarabine is an adenosine analog, which also needs to be in its triphosphate form and blocks herpes-specific DNA polymerase. It has been used for herpes encephalitis or zoster in immunocompromised individuals; however, because of its nephrotoxicity, it has largely been supplanted by acyclovir. Trifluridine is a fluorinated pyrimidine nucleoside analog. Its monophosphate form inhibits thymidylate synthetase and triphosphate form inhibits DNA polymerase. It is active against HSV types 1 and 2 and CMV, and it is used primarily against keratoconjunctivitis and recurrent keratitis.\n\n【12】### ANTI-HIV AGENTS\n\n【13】Retrovir (azidothymidine or zidovudine) inhibits viral reverse transcriptase when its triphosphate form is incorporated into the nucleic acid and blocks further DNA chain elongation, leading to termination of the DNA. In addition, the monophosphate form of Retrovir may block deoxythymidine kinase and inhibit the production of normal dTTp. Its principal role is treating HIV infection, and adverse effects include headache, bone marrow suppression, fever, and abdominal pain.\n\n【14】Didanosine is also a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, primarily used as an adjunct to Retrovir, or for those patients with HIV infection intolerant or unresponsive to zidovudine. Peripheral neuropathy and pancreatic damage are its adverse effects. Stavudine is a thymidine nucleoside analog that inhibits HIV-1 replication and that is used in patients with HIV infection unresponsive to other therapies.\n\n【15】### PROTEASE INHIBITORS\n\n【16】Invirase or saquinavir blocks HIV protease activity, rendering the virus unable to generate essential proteins and enzymes including reverse transcriptase. It is used in combination with a conventional reverse transcriptase inhibitor.### Part 3. Antifungal Agents\n\n【17】In addition to the pyrimidine analog, flucytosine, and the penicillium-derived antifungal agent, griseofulvin, the 3 major classes of antifungal agents are the polyene macrolides, azoles, and allylamines .\n\n【18】Table II-6 • SELECTED ANTIFUNGAL DRUGS\n\n【19】Of all the available antifungal agents, amphotericin B has the broadest spectrum of activity, including activity against yeast, mycoses, and molds. It is the drug of choice for disseminated or invasive fungal infections in immunocompromised patients. The major adverse effect resulting from amphotericin B administration is the almost invariable renal toxicity that results from decreased renal blood flow and from tubular and basement membrane destruction that may be irreversible and may require dialysis. Other adverse effects of amphotericin B relate to its intravenous infusion and include fever, chills, vomiting, hypotension, and headache that can be ameliorated somewhat by careful monitoring and slow infusion.\n\n【20】The azole antifungal agents have a broad spectrum of activity, including activity against candidiasis, mycoses, and dermatophytes, among many others. As topical agents they are relatively safe. Administered orally, their most common adverse effect is GI dysfunction. Hepatic dysfunction may rarely occur. Oral azoles are contraindicated for use with midazolam and triazolam because of potentiation of their hypnotic and sedative effects, and with β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors because of an increased risk of rhabdomyolysis. Itraconazole has been associated with heart failure when used to treat onychomycosis and, therefore, should not be used in patients with ventricular abnormalities. Monitoring patients who receive itraconazole for potential hepatic toxicity is also highly recommended. Voriconazole frequently causes an acute blurring of vision with changes in color perception that resolves quickly.\n\n【21】The allylamine antifungal agents, naftifine and terbinafine, are used topically to treat dermatophytes. Contact with mucous membranes may lead to local irritation and erythema and should be avoided. Terbinafine administered orally is effective against the onychomycosis. Monitoring for potential hepatic toxicity is highly recommended.\n\n【22】Flucytosine is active against only a relatively restricted range of fungal infections. Because of rapid development of resistance, it is used concomitantly for its synergistic effects with other antifungal agents. The most commonly reported adverse effect is bone marrow suppression, probably because of the toxicity of the metabolite fluorouracil, and should be continuously monitored. Other reported less common adverse effects include reversible hepatotoxicity, enterocolitis, and hair loss.\n\n【23】Griseofulvin, the use of which is declining relative to terbinafine and itraconazole, is an effective antifungal agent that is used only systemically to treat a very limited range of dermatophyte infections. The most common adverse effects include hypersensitivity (fever, skin rash, serum-sickness–like syndrome) and headache. It is teratogenic.\n\n【24】### MECHANISM OF ACTION\n\n【25】Nystatin and amphotericin B bind to ergosterol, a major component of fungal cell membranes. This disrupts the stability of the cell by forming pores in the cell membrane that result in leakage of intracellular constituents. Bacteria are not susceptible to these agents because they lack ergosterol.\n\n【26】Azoles (imidazoles less so) have a greater affinity for fungal than human cytochrome P <sub>450 </sub> enzymes and, therefore, more effectively reduce the synthesis of fungal cell ergosterol than human cell cholesterol.\n\n【27】The allylamine antifungal agents, naftifine and terbinafine, decrease ergosterol synthesis and increase fungal membrane disruption by inhibiting the enzyme squalene epoxidase.\n\n【28】Flucytosine must first be transported into fungal cells via a cytosine permease and converted to 5-fluorouracil and then sequentially converted to 5-fluorodeoxyuridylic acid, which disrupts DNA synthesis by inhibiting thymidylate synthetase. Human cells are unable to synthesize the active flucytosine metabolites.\n\n【29】The mechanism of antifungal action of griseofulvin is not definitely known. It acts only on growing skin cells and has been reported to inhibit cell wall synthesis, interfere with nucleic acid synthesis, and disrupt microtubule function, among other activities.\n\n【30】### ADMINISTRATION\n\n【31】Amphotericin B is insoluble in water; therefore, it is generally administered as a colloidal suspension with sodium deoxycholate. Because of its poor absorption from the GI tract, amphotericin B must be given intravenously to treat systemic disease, although it is effective orally for fungal infections within the GI lumen. Likewise, nystatin is poorly absorbed but may also be used for fungal infection of the GI tract. It is too toxic for systemic use; therefore, it is mostly used topically to treat fungal infections of the skin and mucous membranes (eg, oropharyngeal thrush, vaginal candidiasis). Costly lipid formulations of amphotericin B are available for intravenous use, which reduce its nonspecific binding to cholesterol of human cell membranes and, thus, its potential to cause renal damage. Griseofulvin is administered in a microparticulate form to improve absorption.### Part 4. Antiparasitic Agents\n\n【32】Parasitic infections affect one-half of the world’s population and are particularly prevalent in developing countries. Immunocompromised individuals such as those with HIV infection are also prone to parasitic disease. These medications can be categorized as active against malaria, toxoplasmosis, Cyclospora, cryptosporidia, Pneumocystis, amebiasis, leishmaniasis, helminths, trematodes, and cestodes .\n\n【33】Table II-7 • DRUGS FOR PARASITES\n\n【34】MICROBIOLOGY PEARLS\n\n【35】 β-lactam antibiotics inactivate bacterial transpeptidases and prevent the cross-linking of peptidoglycan polymers essential for cell wall integrity.\n\n【36】 Both penicillin and amoxicillin are susceptible to β-lactamases.\n\n【37】 To prevent its metabolism to a nephrotoxic metabolite, imipenem is administered with an inhibitor of renal tubule dehydropeptidase, cilastatin.\n\n【38】 Vancomycin, which is unaffected by β-lactamases, is active against gram-positive bacteria.\n\n【39】 Chloramphenicol can cause GI disturbances, reversible suppression of bone marrow, and rarely plastic anemia.\n\n【40】 Aminoglycosides may cause ototoxicity or nephrotoxicity and should be used with caution in those patients who have renal insufficiency or who are elderly.\n\n【41】 The primary strategy of antiviral agents is to attack a unique but vital viral enzyme or process.\n\n【42】 The three major types of antiviral agents include DNA polymerase inhibitors, reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and protease inhibitors.\n\n【43】 HIV therapy usually uses at least two reverse transcriptase inhibitors and one protease inhibitor.\n\n【44】 Didanosine is also a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor for HIV infections and is associated with peripheral neuropathy and pancreatic damage.\n\n【45】 Foscarnet is a synthetic nonnucleoside analog of pyrophosphate and is associated with reversible nephrotoxicity; hypo- or hypercalcemia and phosphatemia that may lead to neural and cardiac dysfunction. In addition, hallucinations, genital ulceration, and anemia may occur.\n\n【46】 Itraconazole has been associated with heart failure when used to treat onychomycosis and, therefore, should not be used in patients with ventricular abnormalities.\n\n【47】 A common side effect of griseofulvin is hypersensitivity.\n\n【48】 Because of renal toxicity, amphotericin B is often used to initiate a clinical response before substituting a continuing maintenance dose of an azole.\n删除16：<u>### REFERENCES\n通用删除2(英):<u>删除20：<u>Gale EF, Cundliffe E, Reynolds PE, et al .

He presented initially with persistent fever on January 30th, with a body temperature of up to 40°C. He tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 nucleic acids at the Central Hospital of Wuhan, and a chest CT scan revealed a patchy infection at the inferior lobe of the right lung. He was treated with cephalosporin and antiviral drugs (no further detail) for 6 days in consideration of “viral pneumonia”, still having intermittent fever mainly in the afternoon and an occasional cough. On February 9th, the patient tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 nucleic acids again at Wuhan Red Cross hospital, and chest CT showed severe infectious inflammation of both the lungs and a small amount of pleural effusion on the left. The patient was still feverish with body temperature fluctuating between 38°C and 39°C, accompanied by coughing. The symptoms worsened in the afternoon and night. Therefore, he was transferred to our hospital for further diagnosis and treatment. Since the onset of the disease, the patient had had intermittent fever; fatigue; poor energy, appetite, and sleep; loose stools; and weight loss. He was healthy before, having no history of any surgery or trauma, no history of exposure to Huanan seafood market, and no recent history of family members suffering from COVID-19, and he denied history of drug allergies.\n\n【11】### Patient’s Condition on Admission\n\n【12】On admission, the patient was in low spirits. He was afebrile with mild cough, fatigue, poor appetite and sleep, and loose stools. He did not feel short of breath after physical activity. The tongue was purplish red with a yellow greasy coating 删除33：<u></u>, and the pulse was thready and slippery.\n\n【13】Physical examination: body temperature: 36.3°C; heart rate: 116 beats/min; respiratory rate: 22 breaths/min; blood pressure: 110/80 mmHg; oxygen saturation values as measured by pulse oximetry while he was breathing ambient air: 87%.\n\n【14】### Admission Diagnosis\n\n【15】① COVID-19 (severe type). ② Gallstone.\n\n【16】### Treatment Plan\n\n【17】On admission, given the patient’s chest tightness and dyspnea, and his oxygen saturation in the resting state without supplemental oxygen being 87%, he was started on supplemental oxygen, delivered by nasal cannula at 5 L/min. Afterward, his oxygen saturation value elevated to 97%. Laboratory results: white blood cell count: 3.43 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L; absolute neutrophil count: 1.85 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L; absolute lymphocyte count: 1.23 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L; erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR): 42 mm/h; serum ferritin: 377.72 ng/ml; albumin: 29.2 g/L; lactate dehydrogenase: 266 U/L; amyloid A: 142.2 mg/L; hypersensitive C-reactive protein: 51.3 mg/L; interleukin 6 (IL-6): 623.50 pg/ml. Coagulation indexes and procalcitonin were within the normal ranges. Chest CT performed on February 10th revealed infections in both the lungs, indicating a likely viral pneumonia, as well as a small amount of pleural effusion on the left 删除33：<u></u>.\n\n【18】删除3：<u>Figure 2-2-1. Tongue picture on admission.</u>\n\n【19】### Western Medicine Treatment Strategies 删除换行1 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> The patient’s symptoms (fever, dyspnea, and cough) and lab results (pre-admission nucleic acid test for SARS-CoV-2 being positive, chest CT revealing inflammatory infiltration in both the lungs) both agreed with COVID-19 diagnosis.\n\n【20】通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> Severity evaluation: The patient was defined as a severe case of COVID-19. According to the 5th edition of the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for COVID-19, severe cases should meet at least one of the following criteria: ① Pulmonary distress with respiratory rate ≥ 30 breaths/min; ② oxygen saturation in the resting state ≤ 93%; ③ the ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ≤ 300 mmHg; ④ radiologic findings are suggesting progression of the lung lesions > 50% within 24–48 h. Given that the patient’s oxygen saturation in the resting state was 87% which reached 97% under supplemental oxygen at 5 L/min, and that his chest CT revealed a significant progression compared to the pre-admission result, he was classified as a severe case of COVID-19.\n\n【21】删除3：<u>Figure 2-2-2. Chest CT scanned on February 10th.</u>\n\n【22】Note : Extensive, patchy, and cloud-like shadows with blurred edges were visible, as well as a small amount of pleural effusion on the left.\n\n【23】His neutrophil percentage within the normal range, reduced white blood cell count, and normal procalcitonin level all indicated a viral instead of bacterial infection. So, antibiotics were not included in the treatment.\n\n【24】### TCM Treatment Strategies\n\n【25】#### 02/09/2020\n\n【26】The patient’s tongue was purplish red with a yellowish greasy coating, and his pulse was thready and slippery. Given the symptoms and manifestations of tongue and pulse, the patient was diagnosed to have a syndrome of damp-heat accumulation and epidemic toxin blocking the lungs. For his treatment, TCM formula Granule No. 2 issued in the 4th edition of the “National TCM Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for COVID-19” was chosen. Granule No. 2 is composed of Xuanbai Chengqi Decoction, Dayuan Drink, and Maxing Shigan Decoction. The lungs and the large intestine are interior-exteriorly related, which is why Xuanbai Chengqi Decoction can descend the lung Qi by dredging the intestine. On the contrary, Maxing Shigan Decoction can disperse the lung Qi upward. So, the combination of these two can promote up-down Qi movement in the body. Dayuan Drink is for resolving dampness and eliminating turbidity: Bing Lang (Semen Areca) is pungent in flavor and it can eliminate dampness, dissipate phlegm, and break masses; Cao Guo (Fructus Tsaoko) outthrusts and removes incubating turbid pathogens; Shi Gao (Gypsum Fibrosum) clears away the heat; and Da Huang (Rhubarb) can drive pathogenic heat out of the body through defecation, and cool the blood.\n\n【27】The formula was as follows: Xing Ren (Bitter Apricot Seed) 10 g, Sheng Shi Gao (Gypsum Fibrosum) 30 g, Gua Lou (Snake gourd Fruit) 30 g, Sheng Da Huang (Fresh Rhubarb) 6 g (decocted later), Sheng Ma Huang (Fresh Ephedra) 6 g, Zhi Ma Huang (Stir-fry Ephedra) 6 g, Ting Li Zi (Pepperweed Seed) 10 g, Tao Ren (Peach Seed) 10 g, Cao Guo (Fructus Tsaoko) 6 g, Bing Lang (Semen Areca) 10 g, Cang Zhu (Swordlike Atractylodes Rhizome) 10 g. Seven doses of TCM granules were prescribed. Administration: Take 1 dose per day, half both in the morning and evening.\n\n【28】The patient’s tongue was purplish red with a yellowish greasy coating, indicating apparently accumulation of dampness and heat. Intravenous drip 0.9% sodium chloride injection 250 ml with Tanreqing Injection 40 ml, combined with intravenous drip 0.9% sodium chloride injection 250 ml with Xingnaojing Injection 20 ml was given once per day to clear away heat and remove toxin.\n\n【29】After receiving treatment of Tanreqing injection, Xingnaojing injection, and Granule No. 2 during hospitalization, the patient reported the absence of fever, as well as a significant decrease in severity of cough, shortness of breath, and fatigue after physical activity. His energy, appetite, and sleep quality improved, but he still passed loose stools 1 or 2 times a day. There were no further symptoms reported. The fractional concentration of his supplemental oxygen was decreased daily according to his oxygen saturation values. Nucleic acid tests for SRAS-CoV-2 performed on February 10th, February 12th, and February 14th were all negative.\n\n【30】#### 02/15/2020\n\n【31】The patient complained of an occasional cough, without dyspnea, shortness of breath, or fatigue. He maintained a good appetite and energy but poor sleep quality. His bowel movements returned to normal. The tongue was pink with a thin yellowish greasy coating, and the pulse was thready and slippery. Laboratory results: white blood cell count: 5.34 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L; absolute neutrophil count: 3.03 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L; absolute lymphocyte count: 1.68 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L; albumin: 31.9g/L; hypersensitive C-reactive protein: 1.9mg/L; amyloid A: <3.7 mg/L; interleukin 6 (IL-6): 21.32 pg/ml. Chest CT on February 16th revealed reduction of the infections in both the lungs compared to the result on February 10th 删除33：<u></u>.\n\n【32】#### 02/18/2020\n\n【33】The patient was fully conscious with good energy; he still had an occasional cough and mild discomfort in the throat. Dyspnea and chest tightness were not reported, neither feeling fatigue or short of breath after physical activity. He had a good appetite, improved sleep quality, and normal urination and defecation. His tongue was plump with a thin yellowish greasy coating 删除33：<u></u>, and his pulse was thready and slippery. Physical examination: body temperature: 36.6°C; heart rate: 90 beats/min; respiratory rate: 20 breaths/min; blood pressure: 120/80 mmHg; oxygen saturation in the resting state without supplemental oxygen: 98%.\n\n【34】删除3：<u>Figure 2-2-3. Chest CT scanned on February 16th.</u>\n\n【35】Note : Cloud-like shadows were visible in both the lungs, less than before.\n\n【36】删除3：<u>Figure 2-2-4. Tongue picture on February 18th.</u>\n\n【37】The patient was afebrile and symptoms like cough and fatigue had greatly improved. Chest CT revealed a reduction of the lung infection, and 3 consecutive nucleic acid tests for SARS-CoV-2 were negative, which met the discharge standard. He was discharged to a 14-day isolation, during which he would be followed up by telephone. In addition, according to his tongue and pulse manifestation, 14 doses of Huashi Baidu Decoction were prescribed in order to clear away the remaining epidemic toxin and boost the spleen and lung Qi. Huashi Baidu Decoction originates from several classic TCM formulas including Maxing Shigan Decoction, Xuanbai Chengqi Decoction, Dayuan Drink, Huoxiang Zhengqi Powder, Taoren Chengqi Decoction, and Tingli Dazao Xiefei Decoction. Maxing Shigan Decoction and Xuanbai Chengqi Decoction can clear away heat and ventilate lung Qi in the upper Jiao. Dayuan Drink and Huoxiang Zhengqi Powder can regulate Qi in the middle Jiao by resolving dampness and harmonizing the stomach. Taoren Chengqi Decoction and Tingli Dazao Xiefei Decoction can promote blood circulation and detoxification, dredging the lower Jiao. In addition, medicines from Huangqi Chifeng Decoction and Yupingfeng Powder are added to invigorate healthy Qi and regulate Qi and blood.\n\n【38】The formula was as follows: Sheng Ma Huang (Ephedra Herb) 6 g, Xing Ren (Bitter Apricot Seed) 9 g, Sheng Shi Gao (Gypsum Fibrosum) 15 g, Gan Cao (Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma) 3 g, Huo Xiang (Wrinkled Gianthyssop Herb) 10 g (Decocted Later), Hou Po (Officinal Magnolia Bar) 10 g, Cang Zhu (Swordlike Atractylodes Rhizome) 15 g, Cao Guo (Tsaoko Amomum) 10 g, Fa Ban Xia (Pinelliae Rhizoma Preparatum) 9 g, Fu Ling (Indian Buead) 15 g, Sheng Da Huang (Rhubarb) 5 g (Decocted Later), Sheng Huang Qi (Membranous Milkvetch Root) 10 g, Ting Li Zi (Pepperweed Seed) 10 g, Chi Shao (Paeoniaeradix Rubra) 10 g. Fourteen doses of TCM granules were prescribed. Administration: Take 1 dose per day, once both in the morning and evening.\n\n【39】### Evaluation of Effectiveness\n\n【40】1\\. Improvements in main symptoms: The patient no longer felt short of breath after hospital day 4, with no need for supplemental oxygen. By hospital day 6, he no longer felt fatigue, and his cough had declined in severity.\n\n【41】2\\. Changes in laboratory results: The hypersensitive C-reactive protein and amyloid A reflected a significant decrease on hospital day 5, coinciding with the radiographic improvements 删除33：<u></u>.\n\n【42】3\\. Changes in radiography images are shown in Figures 2-2-2 and 2-2-3 .\n\n【43】删除3：<u>Figure 2-2-5. Changes in the level of the hypersensitive C-reactive protein and amyloid A.</u>\n\n【44】### Patient’s Condition at Discharge\n\n【45】On February 18th, the patient reported no symptoms other than mild cough and discomfort in the throat. He was afebrile and symptoms like cough and fatigue had greatly improved. Chest CT revealed a reduction of the lung infection, and 3 consecutive nucleic acid tests for SARS-CoV-2 were negative, which met the discharge standards. He was transferred to a specific isolation point after being discharged, and had been followed up by telephone ever since.\n\n【46】### Case Analysis\n\n【47】The patient had received treatment of cephalosporin and antiviral drugs for 6 days before admission. Yet his chest CT results showed deterioration of his condition. Chest CT on January 30th showed patchy infection at the inferior lobe of the right lung, and severe infectious inflammation was observed in both the lungs on February 9th. The disease gradually progressed, and after admission, it was assessed that the patient had SARS-CoV-2 infection. We boldly adopted a TCM treatment scheme for his condition, aiming at “removing toxin”. Youke Wu stated in Wenyi Lun ( Treatise on Plague ) that “plagues are not caused by pathogenic wind, pathogenic cold, summer-heat, nor pathogenic damp, but are under attack by one peculiar Qi from nature.” This peculiar Qi is in fact epidemic toxin, to which SARS-CoV-2 belongs. We believe that COVID-19 is a “dampplague”, one kind of plague caused by epidemic toxin whose nature is similar to pathogenic dampness, instead of pathogenic dampness itself. To treat plague, the first priority, as pointed out by Jiayan Yu, is to eliminate turbid pathogens and remove toxin. To remove the epidemic toxin in patients with COVID-19, it is necessary to apply dampness-resolving methods against its nature akin to pathogenic dampness. It is therefore suggested in Yimen Banghe, chapter Shiwen that “After an exogenous pathogen invades the body, it will transform according to the body’s own Qi. If the body is abundant in Yang Qi, the pathogen will be transformed into heat, causing Yangming syndrome.” The patient in this case is young with innate heat excess, so the exogenous damp-toxin that invaded his body could be dried by Yangming-earth (the spleen and stomach) and transform into heat, causing accumulation of dampness-heat and thus syndrome of heat transformed from epidemic toxin blocking the lungs. Therefore, our treatment focused on clearing away heat, resolving dampness, and removing toxin by combining Huashi Baidu Decoction with TCM injections, and it achieved very good results.\n\n【48】Clinically, many patients with COVID-19 showed sinus tachycardia. As far as we are concerned, there are several explanations toward it: patients’ mental stress and anxiety leading to sympathetic activation, the heart beating faster in order to compensate for severe hypoxia of the body, and myocardial damage is caused by viral infection. Therefore, in treating COVID-19 patients, attention should be given not only to their respiratory tract condition but also to their heart condition. Sinus tachycardia is the most common type of arrhythmia with which COVID-19 patients presented, manifesting as palpitation. If it is combined with atrial tachycardia or atrial fibrillation, obvious fatigue and chest tightness will occur; if it is combined with premature ventricular contraction (PVC) or paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia, palpitation, dizziness, and even syncope will occur. Patients with acute inflammatory cytokine storm may suffer sustained ventricular tachycardia or even ventricular fibrillation, which is life-threatening. This is the reason why we should attach great importance to patients’ vital signs.\n\n【49】删除32：<u>(Wensheng Qi, Jinliang Yang, Jiaheng Shi, You Li, Dan Zhang)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The student would be correct if:\n\n【1】A. It involves the movement of only one limb\n\n【2】B. It is easily described by observers\n\n【3】C. It is focal, and normal consciousness is preserved\n\n【4】D. It is focal, and consciousness is altered but not completely lost\n\n【5】E. It is focal and very brief\n\n【6】Answer: 49.1 C . A simple partial seizure is a focal seizure that does not alter the patient’s level of consciousness.\n\n【7】Question: 49.2 Which of the following is typical of seizures seen in patients with BRE?\n\n【8】A. Occur mostly during the daytime\n\n【9】B. Are generalized from the outset\n\n【10】C. Primarily involve the lower extremities\n\n【11】D. Recur frequently\n\n【12】E. Often begin in the face or mouth\n\n【13】Answer: 49.2 E . The seizures of BRE are usually nocturnal, infrequent, begin with orofacial involvement, and can secondarily generalize.\n\n【14】Question: 49.3 A 5-year-old boy with epilepsy has partial seizures arising from the left frontal lobe. An MRI of his brain reveals a large area of gliosis in the left dorsolateral frontal lobe consistent with an old stroke. This patient’s epilepsy would be classified as:\n\n【15】A. Idiopathic generalized\n\n【16】B. Cryptogenic localization-related\n\n【17】C. Idiopathic localization-related\n\n【18】D. Symptomatic localization-related\n\n【19】E. Acute symptomatic\n\n【20】Answer: 49.3 D . The patient has an anatomic abnormality (an area of glial scarring) visible on MRI at the area of seizure onset and therefore has symptomatic localization-related (partial) epilepsy. These are not acute symptomatic seizures as described because there is no provoking factor present. Instead, they are a chronic sequelae of a remote event.\n\n【21】Question: 49.4 A 9-year-old girl is brought to the clinic with a history entirely consistent with the diagnosis of BRE. An EEG is obtained that reveals the centrotemporal sharp waves characteristic of this disorder. The patient has had one witnessed seizure 2 weeks ago and had one unwitnessed event 1 year ago, which may have been a seizure. The child’s parents are not very interested in beginning daily anticonvulsant medication. Which of the following would be the best course of treatment for this patient?\n\n【22】A. Strongly encourage the parents to begin a low dose of daily valproic acid\n\n【23】B. Prescribe prophylactic diazepam in case of febrile illness\n\n【24】C. Reassure the family and encourage “watchful waiting” to see if further seizures occur\n\n【25】D. Obtain an MRI prior to making any treatment recommendations\n\n【26】E. Recommend twice-daily dosing of oxcarbazepine\nAnswer: 49.4 C . In the context of typical BRE with infrequent seizures “watchful waiting” is the most prudent approach.

Describe the treatment strategies for PMDD. 删除34：<u>(EPA 4)</u>\n\n【15】Considerations\n\n【16】This case captures a classic presentation of PMDD， namely irritability and associ-ated symptomatology reoccurring in a premenstrual pattern.PMDD requires that the symptoms occur during the week before menses for at least two menstrual cycles in a row， and improve within a few days after the onset of menses. PMDD manifests with a perimenstrual surge and subsequent recession of mood， behavior， and physical symptoms. Although exacerbation of psychiatric and medical condi-tions can occur premenstrually， PMDD better accounts for the clinical picture. This patient's history is very suggestive of PMDD， but all of the diagnostic crite-ria are not yet met. Further evaluation such as with a prospective symptom diary would be helpful.\n\n【17】APPROACHTO：\n\n【18】DEFINITIONS\n\n【19】AFFECTIVE LABILITY： Rapid changes in affect， for example， mood swings.\n\n【20】FOLLICULAR PHASE OF MENSTRUATION： Begins with onset of men-ses through the day before the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge. Phase length is approximately 14 to 21 days.\n\n【21】LUTEAL PHASE OF MENSTRUATION： Begins on the day of the LH surge through onset of menses. Ovulation occurs about 36 hours after the LH surge. Phase length is 14 days.\n\n【22】CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【23】Diagnosis Criteria\n\n【24】The diagnosis of PMDD is based upon a perimenstrual pattern of at least five affec-tive， physical (somatic)， and/or behavioral symptoms， with at least one of the four key affective symptoms being：\n\n【25】Affective lability\n\n【26】Irritability or anger that is often characterized by increased interpersonal conflicts\n\n【27】Marked depressed mood， hopelessness， or self-deprecating thoughts\n\n【28】Anxiety， tension， or feeling on edge\n\n【29】There may be difficulty concentrating or a sense of feeling overwhelmed or out of control. These cognitive-affective symptoms can be accompanied by behavioral and somatic symptoms such as loss of interest in usual activities， lack of energy， changes in appetite or food cravings， changes in sleep， and physical symptoms unique to the premenstruum such as breast tenderness， breast swelling， or bloating. Per DSM-5criteria， these symptoms must have occurred during most menstrual cycles in the past year to meet criteria for PMDD diagnosis. Symptoms start during the luteal phase of menstrual cycle and are severe from 3 to 4 days prior to onset of menses to up to 3 days post-menses onset. Symptoms improve during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle and must be absent by the postmenstrual week. Patients should be encouraged to record their symptoms using various available tools such as the calendar of premenstrual experiences or premenstrual assessment tool. The presence of two or more symptomatic cycles showing clear symptom commence-ment and resolution will aid toward the diagnosis， while the presence of symptoms throughout the cycle may point toward other psychiatric disorders. Table 15-1lists the diagnostic criteria for PMDD.\n\n| Table15-1·DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FORPREMENSTRUAL  |\n| --- |\n| DYSPHORIC DISORDER  |\n| During the majority of menstrual cycles over the last year， multiple symptoms begin the weekbefore menses， improve within days after the onset of menses， and are minimal/absent during the post-menses week. At least five symptoms total from both mood and associated symptom categories： Mood Symptoms ·Depression，hopelessness，self-deprecation ·Affective instability， mood swings， rejection sensitivity · Increased irritability，anger， or interpersonal conflicts · Significant anxiety and tension Associated Symptoms ·Decreased interest ·Concentration difficulty · Insomnia or hypersomnia ·Fatigue or decreased energy ·Easily overwhelmed ·Change in appetite or specific cravings ·Weight gain， bloating，muscle/joint pain， breast tenderness， or swelling Symptoms cause significant distress or impairment in functioning. Symptoms are not caused by substance abuse， medication， or a medical condition.  |\n\n【31】Pathogenesis\n\n【32】The timing of symptom onset and offset in PMDD suggests that hormonal fluc-tuation is a key component in PMDD’s pathogenesis. Although there have been no measurable differences in hormonal levels in women with or without PMDD， recent research suggests that women with PMDD have altered sensitivity to normal hormonal fluctuations， particularly estrogen and progesterone—neuroactive steroids that influence central nervous system function， which is believed to be the etiology of this disorder. The premenstruum， along with postpartum and perimenopause， are all periods of hormonal fluctuation and thus windows of vulnerability for mood disorders. These physiologic hormonal changes trigger mood symptoms for some women. Premenstrual syndrome (PMS)/PMDD can be considered a significant risk factor for postpartum depression. Many women suffer from mild nonpatho-logic premenstrual issues； 2% to 5% of premenopausal women experience clinical symptoms that cause impairment in functioning. PMDD may begin at any time after menarche and symptoms remit after menopause. Cyclical hormone replace-ment can potentially retrigger PMDD symptoms.\n\n【33】Differential Diagnosis\n\n【34】Medical Conditions. As always， rule out direct effect of substance or another medi-cal condition as the underlying cause. Thyroid dysfunction， fibromyalgia， and irri-table bowel syndrome may manifest similarly. Exogenous hormones prescribed to alleviate premenstrual symptoms may sometimes cause or exacerbate the problem. Evaluate if the symptoms occur after initiation of hormonal therapy and if they resolve with medication discontinuation.\n\n【35】Premenstrual Syndrome. PMS is generally less severe than PMDD with fewer symptoms and without significant mood changes. There is a higher prevalence of PMS compared to PMDD. Dysmenorrhea describes pain associated with menses but lacks mood changes. The pain begins with the onset of menses， whereas in PMDD the symptoms improve during menses. Perimenopause presents similarly as PMS but without the cyclicity.\n\n【36】Mood Disorders. Mood disorders including major depressive disorder (MDD)， persistent depressive disorder， and bipolar disorder may be on the differential. The key aspect in delineating a diagnosis involves examining the timing of symptom onset in relation to the premenstrual phase. Clinical trials have revealed that mood swings and irritability are the most severe of the affective symptoms while depressed mood was least， which further distinguishes PMDD from MDD. Although bipo-lar disorder commonly presents with irritability and mood lability， the predictable perimenstrual pattern is specific to PMDD.\n\n【37】Symptoms of psychiatric and medical conditions can worsen during the pre-menstrual phase， but the symptoms do not resolve postmenstruation. In addition to gathering a thorough history and collateral information， ask the patient to use daily prospective ratings for at least two consecutive cycles to obtain more objective data.\n\n【38】Treatment\n\n【39】Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inbibitors. SSRIs have emerged as first-line therapy for PMDD， targeting irritability， depression， and associated physical symptoms within days. Notably， SSRIs work faster in PMS/PMDD compared to any other psychiatric disorder. This rapid onset of action is likely due to the SSRIs’ability to enhance formation of neuroactive steroids， such as ALLO. This short onset of action makes intermittent dosing (administering the medication only during the luteal phase， from the time of ovulation until menstruation begins) possible. SSRIs may be started after the onset of symptoms of PMDD (symptom-onset therapy) as well， and relatively low doses have shown to be effective. Continuous therapy may be more effective for patients with erratic menstrual cycles or in those who cannot follow the dosing regimen. Continuous dosing is ideal in the case of comorbid mood/anxiety disorders or SSRI discontinuation syndrome. Some studies indicate that PMDD symptoms respond better to SSRIs when compared to SNRIs.\n\n【40】Other Treatment Options. Previous studies indicate that TCAs are generally not efficacious， with the exception of clomipramine. Hormonal therapy including com-bination oral contraceptives suppress ovulation， thus eliminating the luteal phase， and predominately address the associated physical discomfort. Oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) should be used with caution， as some studies have shown exogenous hormones to negatively impact mood. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog has been used to suppress ovarian function and thus the hormones. Any hormonal treatment that needs to be continued for 3 or more months must be managed by gynecologists. Cognitive behavioral therapy may be useful in helping patients better manage their symptoms.\n删除16：<u>CASE CORRELATION\n\n【41】● See also Case 13 (Major Depressive Disorder) and Case 14 (Persistent Depressive Disorder).\n</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The HFEA issues licences for conditions for which PGD can be used. It must  删除换行1 consider that the genetic condition is sufficiently serious before it grants a licence to test for  删除换行1 it.

The World Health Organisation  删除换行1 states that a disability is not just a health problem but reflects the interaction between features  删除换行1 of a person’s body and features of the society in which he or she lives.

She is afebrile, with normal-appearing tympanic membranes and throat. She has right maxillary and frontal tenderness.\n\n【8】• Most likely diagnosis: Maxillary and frontal sinusitis\n\n【9】• Anatomical explanation for this condition: Blocked drainage of the sinuses secondary to an allergic reaction of the nasal mucosa\n\n【10】### CLINICAL CORRELATION\n\n【11】Sinusitis, a condition common in Americans, is an inflammation of one or more of the six sets of paranasal sinuses, most of which are related to the orbits. Inflammation may be caused by viruses, allergies, and bacterial pathogens. The sinuses are usually sterile cavities that are lined by ciliated mucosa rich in mucous cells, and mucus drains directly into the nasal cavities through small openings, or ostia. Edema of the nasal mucosa can easily occlude these openings and lead to secondary infection. The maxillary sinus is most commonly involved, and sinus pain or pressure sensation is typical. Transillumination of the sinuses that demonstrates opacification may be helpful on physical examination. Radiographs may also be helpful; CT imaging is usually reserved for complicated cases. The recent acquisition of a cat by the patient suggests maxillary and frontal sinusitis caused by an allergy rather than an infectious agent. Oral or topical (spray) decongestants, antihistamines, and/or nasal steroids are often helpful. Antibiotics are not indicated at this time, but the patient should be instructed to watch for development of fever or an increase in tenderness. Complications include osteomyelitis, ocular cellulitis, and cavernous sinus thrombophlebitis.\n\n【12】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【13】#### The Sinuses\n\n【14】### OBJECTIVES\n\n【15】1\\.

These spaces are lined with respiratory mucosa, decrease the weight of the skull, and probably assist in humidifying inspired air. See Case 51 for the anatomy of the nasal cavity. The sphenoid sinuses are located within the sphenoid bone, are variable in size and number, and open into the sphenoethmoidal recess. The ethmoidal sinuses consist of a series of sinuses positioned between the medial wall of the orbit and the nasal cavity (at the level of the bridge of the nose). For descriptive purposes, they are divided into anterior, middle, and posterior ethmoidal cells, and each has a separate opening. The posterior ethmoidal cells open inside the superior nasal meatus. The middle ethmoidal cells elevate the ethmoid bone in the middle meatus, thus creating the ethmoid bulla on whose surface these cells open. Inferior to the ethmoid bulla is a groove, the semilunar hiatus. The anterior ethmoidal cells open into the anterior portion of the hiatus, called the infundibulum.\n\n【22】删除3：<u>Figure 48-1. Sinuses in the coronal view. 删除10：<u>( Reproduced, with permission, from Lindner HH. Clinical Anatomy. East Norwalk, CT: Appleton & Lange, 1989:68 .)</u></u>\n\n【23】The largest sinuses are the maxillary and frontal sinuses , and their relatively large openings also drain into the middle meatus. The large maxillary sinus hollows the maxillary bone. The roof of the sinus, which also forms the floor of the orbit, is very thin and at risk in direct trauma to the orbit, which would cause sudden increases in pressure. Such trauma may cause “blowout” fractures of the orbital floor. The opening of the maxillary sinus is found in the semilunar hiatus. The frontal sinuses are found in the frontal bone between the inner and outer tables and in the portion that forms the roof of the orbit. It is drained by the frontonasal duct , which opens into the infundibulum, the anterior portion of the semilunar hiatus.\n\n【24】###", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

There is a mucosal bulging through the introitus. The remainder of the pelvic examination including the rectal examination and Q-tip test is normal.\n\n【7】Most likely diagnosis： Vaginal vault prolapse.\n\n【8】Underlying etiology： Enterocele with small bowel in hernia sac behind the vaginal cuff.\n\n【9】Options for therapy： Pessary device or surgical fixation ofthe vagina to a sturdy structure such as the sacrospinous ligament， the uterosacral ligaments， or the sacrum.\n\n【10】Objectives\n\n【11】1\\. Understand the anatomical support of the pelvic organs provided by the pelvic diaphragm and endopelvic fascia.\n\n【12】2\\. Describe the types of pelvic organ prolapse (POP) based on location： cystocele(anterior)， enterocele (central)，rectocele (posterior)， paravaginal (lateral).\n\n【13】3\\. Describe the symptoms of the various types of POP defects and treatment options.\n\n【14】Considerations\n\n【15】This 55-year-old patient has a sensation of something falling out of the vagina. She has had three vaginal deliveries and a total abdominal hysterectomy in the past， both of which are risk factors for developing POP. On examination， the vaginal cuff is noted at the introitus. Examination of the anterior compartment (bladder) is nor-mal in support， including Q-tip test. If the urethra were not well supported， the finding of urethral hypermobility might be present causing the urethral Q-tip to rotate through a large angle on Valsava. The posterior compartment is also well sup-ported (rectum). There is no mention of the lateral support. Almost inevitably， an enterocele is present associated with vaginal vault prolapse. It is unlikely that con-servative measures， such as pelvic muscle strengthening exercises， will alleviate this patients symptoms. This patient is overweight at 160 lb. Some studies suggest that a 10% decrease in weight may significantly decrease prolapse symptoms. Thus， this patient should be counseled regarding weight loss， which may alleviate symptoms， or at the least， reduce surgical risks and make the procedure technically easier to accomplish. Therefore， the best treatments include either pessary， which is a syn-thetic device used to act as a \"hammock\"to suspend the pelvic organs， or surgery.\n\n【16】Surgical repair includes dissection and ligation of the hernia sac associated with the enterocele. Fixation of the vagina is then achieved to a sturdy structure such as the sacrospinous ligament or the uterosacral ligaments (vaginal approach)， or abdomi-nal sacrocolpopexy (fixing the vaginal cuff to the sacrum using a synthetic mesh).\n\n【17】APPROACHTO：\n\n【18】Pelvic Organ Prolapse\n\n【19】DEFINITIONS\n\n【20】CYSTOCELE： Defect of the pelvic muscular support of the anterior vagina allow-ing the bladder to descend into the vagina. Often the urethra is hypermobile. This is an anterior POP defect.\n\n【21】ENTEROCELE：Defect of the pelvic muscular support of the uterus and cervix (if still in situ) or the vaginal cuff (ifhysterectomy).The small bowel and/ or omentum descend into the vagina. This is a central POP defect.\n\n【22】RECTOCELE： Defect of the pelvic muscular support of the rectum， allowing the rectum to impinge into the vagina. The patient may have constipation or difficulty evacuating stool. This is a posterior POP defect.\n\n【23】PARAVAGINAL DEFECT： Defect in the levatorani attachment to the lateral pel-vic side wall leading to lack of support ofthe vagina， known as a lateral pelvic defect.\n\n【24】CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【25】Pelvic organ prolapse has a prevalence of 30% to 50% in parous women with 4%to8% becoming symptomatic， particularly those over the age of 40 years， and with greater incidence after menopause. The symptoms vary and can include a heavi-ness or pressure sensation in the pelvis， a bulging mass (central)， difficulty voiding or incomplete bladder emptying， urinary incontinence (anterior)， constipation or having to use ones fingers to apply pressure on the vagina as a splint to achieve a bowel movement (posterior)， sexual dysfunction or pain with intercourse 删除33：<u></u>.\n\n【26】The pelvic diaphragm， a muscular and ligamentous network， which attaches from the pubic bone to the sacrum to the lateral pelvic side walls acts to support the pelvic organs. The pelvic diaphragm consists of multiple muscles such as the pubo-coccygeus， puborectalis， and levatorani. The bladder sits on the pelvic diaphragm and defects will lead to its descent from the normal location. Known risk factors for POP include multiple vaginal births， aging， prior pelvic surgery， hysterectomy， constipation， irritable bowel syndrome， genetic predisposition， lack of estrogen， and obesity. Potential， but still debated， risk factors include episiotomy， high birth weight infants， chronic cough， exercise， heavy lifting， and lower education.\n\n【27】Physical examination can be revealing and indicate what type of defect is pres-ent. The examination should be conducted with the patient in the lithotomy as well as standing positions. The bladder should be examined for support， with a 删除换行4 cystocele noted if it is bulging into the vagina. When the patient bears down， it should be noted whether the bladder moves further downward. Additionally， a cot-ton applicator tip may be placed into the urethra and the angle of excursion of the Q-tip should be observed at rest and with Valsalva. Hypermobility includes a resting urethral angle >30° or a maximal angle strain during Valsava >30°.The rectum should likewise be examined both vaginally and with a rectal examination. The perineal body is often attenuated and weakened with a posterior defect. If the patient has her uterus and cervix， then its position should be noted in relationship to the hymenal ring. With bearing down， the cervix may descend. Various systems are used to grade the degree of uterine prolapse； one such system is to delineate mild (above the hymen)， moderate (at the hymen)， complete (beyond the hymen). Sometimes the entire uterus is prolapsed out of the patient’s introitus， the so-called procidentia. Women who have had a hysterectomy previously are at risk for vaginal cuff prolapse due to failure to fix the vagina to supporting cardinal or uterosacral ligaments. A paravaginal defect is assessed by palpating the lateral aspects of the vagina for its support and mobility.\n删除3：<u>Figure 33-1. Note the types ofanatomic pelvic organ prolapse such as cystocele and rectocele.</u>\n\n【28】Once the extent and type of POP is discerned， the patient can be counseled about therapy. In general， mild POP defects can be treated with pelvic floor strengthening exercises and observation. More significant defects may be treated by pessary devices， which act as a hammock to support the pelvic structures.Different pessary devices are made for different types of defects 删除33：<u></u>. Surgical approaches to vaginal vault prolapse from an enterocele include resection of redundant tissue， identification of hernia sac and resection if applicable， and 删除换行4 then support of the pelvic muscular defect either with suture to a ligamentous sup-port， or using synthetic mesh. Fixation of the vaginal cuff to the sacrospinous liga-ment for instance is called a sacrospinous ligament fixation procedure. The use of vaginal mesh has been controversial recently， and its use is generally reserved for large defects with thorough informed consent. Using a synthetic material to fix the vaginal cuff to the sacral bone is called a sacrocolpopexy. Recently， the FDA has issued warnings that synthetic meshes in the vagina may lead to erosion and other complications.\n删除3：<u>Figure 33-2.

She describes the pain as constant, located in her neck, lower back, and hips, and as interfering with her day-to-day activities. Over the years she has had extensive work-ups, including laboratory testing and multiple modalities of imaging, none of which led to an explanation for her symptoms. She has had no history of trauma, but does report feeling “down” occasionally. Which treatment would be most appropriate for her at this time?\n\n【1】> (A) A 14-day course of oral doxycycline\n\n【2】> (B) Behavioral therapy\n\n【3】> (C) Group therapy\n\n【4】> (D) Low-dose fentanyl patch\n\n【5】> (E) No treatment; her symptoms will resolve spontaneously with time\n\n【6】 Answer: The correct answer is B. This patient is presenting with pain disorder. This is characterized by pain symptoms that are inconsistent with physiological processes. There is typically a close temporal relationship with psychological factors, and such disorders are seen more commonly in females than males. Peak onset is at age 40-50, and it may be associated with depression. Treatment typically includes rehabilitation, such as behavioral therapy, physical therapy, and psychotherapy. Analgesia is usually not helpful. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and venlafaxine may be therapeutic.  \nAnswer A is incorrect. Doxycycline is the standard treatment for Lyme disease. Lyme disease in advanced stages can present with joint pain and fatigue. However, the patient has had extensive laboratory and clinical assessments, with no indication of an infectious process.  \nAnswer C is incorrect. Group therapy is helpful for many psychiatric conditions, including hypochondriasis. In this disorder there is preoccupation with or fear of having a serious disease despite medical reassurance. This leads to significant distress and impairment, and often involves a history of prior physical disease. Men and women are equally affected, and the onset typically occurs in adulthood. Hypochondriasis is managed with group therapy and regularly scheduled appointments with the patient’s primary caregiver. This patient has not described a preoccupation about her illness, so it is unlikely that she is suffering from hypochondriasis.  \nAnswer D is incorrect. Analgesia, including opioid treatment, is generally not indicated for pain disorder. Physical therapy, TCAs and venlafaxine are more appropriate therapy.  \nAnswer E is incorrect. This answer is incorrect because there are standard treatments for pain disorder. Moreover, pain disorder may not resolve on its own once it has been persistent for several years. In contrast, conversion disorder often resolves spontaneously. Patients with conversion disorder present with symptoms or deficits of voluntary or sensory function (eg, blindness, seizure, or paralysis). These symptoms often occur in close temporal relationship to stress or intense emotion. Conversion disorder is more common in young females, less-educated people, and those from lower socioeconomic classes.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Physical examination reveals increased head circumference and prominent hepatosplenomegaly. Screening laboratory tests reveal a profound anemia and leukopenia. Despite fluid resuscitation and initiation of antibiotic therapy, the child dies. On autopsy, histologic analysis of the child’s bone marrow space reveals a marked infiltration of the medullary canal space by primary bony spongiose tissue. Which malfunctioning cells are the cause of this patient’s disease process?\n\n【1】> (A) Hepatocytes\n\n【2】> (B) Lymphoid progenitor cells\n\n【3】> (C) Osteoblasts\n\n【4】> (D) Osteoclasts\n\n【5】> (E) Reticulocytes\n\n【6】 Answer: The correct answer is D . The most likely diagnosis for this child is osteopetrosis. This rare hereditary disorder occurs from a failure of the resorption and remodeling of bone due to malfunctioning osteoclasts. The skeleton becomes diffusely sclerotic and dense as new bony matrix is laid into the medullary canal, replacing the hematopoietic tissue. Patients compensate with extramedullary hematopoiesis, leading to hepatosplenomegaly. Despite the increased density, the bone is brittle and predisposed to fracture. There are two main types of the disease, characterized by their inheritance patterns. The autosomal-recessive form is more malignant and is often fatal in utero or in the neonatal period. The autosomal-dominant form is usually benign and may be discovered incidentally on x-ray.  \nAnswer A is incorrect . Osteopetrosis presents with hepatomegaly due to the need for extra-medullary hematopoiesis, not a defect of the intrinsic cellular makeup of the liver.  \nAnswer B is incorrect . Despite finding leukopenia in osteopetrosis, the root cause is not a defect in the lymphoid progenitor cells. Their normal proliferation is prevented by the filling of the intramedullary space with bony tissue.  \nAnswer C is incorrect. In osteopetrosis, the function of the osteoblasts goes unchecked by malfunctioning osteoclasts. Though there is an excess of bony material, osteopetrosis is not a neoplastic process.  \nAnswer E is incorrect . Patients with osteopetrosis may often present with anemia. However, this is not due to a defect in RBC maturation.

She lives alone on the third floor of an apartment  删除换行1 building in a well-kept privately owned flat. Her friend lets the GP in as the patient is feeling too shaky to come to the door. She reports that she woke the previous night to go to the  删除换行1 toilet, felt confused, lost her way and fell in the kitchen. She thinks that she momentarily lost  删除换行1 consciousness, but managed to crawl to the toilet and get back into bed. In the morning, she  删除换行1 woke to find blood on her pillow case and on her nightdress. She called her neighbour, who  删除换行1 reports that she found her a little confused, which is unusual as she is normally very alert in  删除换行1 the morning. She is a headhunter in a large and busy city recruitment agency and works long  删除换行1 hours, thoroughly enjoying her job. She is not looking to retire for at least another 5 years. She  删除换行1 is a long-term patient at the practice but does not come very often as she feels healthy. The last  删除换行1 time that she was seen was 1 year earlier when she presented with a sore back as a result of an  删除换行1 overenthusiastic weekend gardening spree. Her blood pressure, weight and general examination at that time was normal and her back settled over a week with rest, non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and private physiotherapy that she had access to through her  删除换行1 company. Since then, she had been in good health and is not on any medication. She eats  删除换行1 sensibly and walks in the country most weekends with her friends, being a member of a local  删除换行1 rambling club. She has not smoked for over 25 years and enjoys a good red wine, drinking  删除换行1 about 12 units/week and never more than two medium glasses (4 units) at a time as she feels  删除换行1 uncomfortably tipsy on more than this. A recent check-up at work revealed a non-fasting  删除换行1 total blood cholesterol of 4.2 mmol/L and a random blood glucose of 5 mmol/L, both normal.\nShe has not had any serious illness and her parents are both still alive in their late 80s, frail  删除换行1 but otherwise well.\n\n【3】Questions\n\n【4】• What does the GP need to explore in the focused history and in the examination?\n\n【5】• What is the differential diagnosis?\n\n【6】ANSWER 24\n\n【7】The GP asks the patient about her health in the weeks leading up to this episode. She reports  删除换行1 that she has not been feeling very well in the last few weeks – not like her normal self. She  删除换行1 has noticed that her concentration has not been as good as usual, has had a slight frontal  删除换行1 headache and has been feeling a bit nauseated and dizzy. These symptoms are at their worse  删除换行1 when she wakes up and improve during the day. She has not had a fever, dysuria or frequency.\nThe GP specifically asks her whether, apart from the night before, she has had any falls or  删除换行1 head injuries recently but she has not. On examination, the GP notices that she has bitten her  删除换行1 tongue and that she has bruises on her left arm and a small cut on her left knee. She is of good  删除换行1 colour and her respiratory, cardiac and neurological examination is normal. She is afebrile  删除换行1 and urinalysis is normal.\n\n【8】The differential diagnosis in acute confusion includes hypoxia, systemic infection, cerebrovascular accident, subdural haematoma, hypoglycaemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, alcohol  删除换行1 withdrawal or intoxication, electrolyte imbalance, uraemia, effect of drug or medication,  删除换行1 myxoedema, cerebral tumour, post-ictal state or carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning.\n\n【9】The GP goes through some of these diagnoses and the patient’s history and examination  删除换行1 findings do not fit. However, very fortunately for the patient, a few weeks earlier another  删除换行1 patient had told the GP that she had had her yearly gas fire check by the council and that they  删除换行1 had found a high level of CO due to a faulty boiler. This patient had been feeling headachy,  删除换行1 sick and sleepy for some time and felt herself lucky to be alive. The GP would not normally  删除换行1 have thought of this diagnosis but because of the other patient’s experience suggests that the  删除换行1 patient have her gas-fired boiler checked immediately and stays with her neighbour until  删除换行1 this is done. As a result, a gas leak is found and the boiler repaired. Her symptoms disappear  删除换行1 with no recurrence of the confusion. The patient installs CO monitors on both floors of her  删除换行1 apartment.\n\n【10】• Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning kills 50 people and seriously injures nearly 200  删除换行1 in the United Kingdom each year.

Start treating the patient with a mood stabilizer such as carbamazepine.\n\n【21】E. Start treating the patient with an antidepressant such as paroxetine.\n\n【22】57.1 A. Decreasing idealization of the unit before admission will help decrease the devaluation that inevitably follows. Since these swings (between ideal-ization and devaluation) are so typical in borderline personality disordered patients， it is useful to minimize idealization right from the time of admis-sion. Otherwise， these patients can become quite disruptive on an inpatient unit， as the patient first comes to the unit believing he or she can be com-pletely and perfectly taken care of， followed by intense anger when devalu-ation follows and the patient believes the inpatient unit is incompetent and useless.\n\n【23】57.2 C. Individuals with BPD often use the defense mechanism of splitting. Split-ting is literally the \"splitting off\"a person's good and bad characteristics into two separate (and nonoverlapping) views of a person， which then alternate. Most healthy adults will be able to characterize people with their good and bad points at the same time. Borderline patients will characterize another as either all good or all bad， depending on which side of the split the patient is currently seeing.\n\n【24】57.3 A. Dialectical behavioral therapy， a form of cognitive therapy， has been shown in controlled studies to be effective in treating BPD. This therapy attempts to help patients explore their own behavior， thoughts， and feelings in the present without delving into the patient's childhood， which tends to be regressive for these patients， resulting in increased suicidal behavior and acting out.\n\n【25】57.4 E. Comorbidity of major depression with BPD is quite common. When vegetative symptoms or other qualitative changes occur， medication for the major depression is necessary. SSRIs are the first-line psychopharmacologic treatments. This is often a difficult call to make because borderline person-ality disorder patients present as \"stably unstable\"； that is， their lives are 删除换行1 often disruptive and chaotic and they often have severely depressed moods. Changes in sleep or appetite are often the best clues as to when a BPD patient has developed a concurrent major depression.\n\n【26】CLINICALPEARLS\n\n【27】Patients with BPD show a pervasive pattern of unstable personal relation-ships， self-images， and emotions. They can often be markedly impulsive， displaying sexual acting out， suicidal gestures， and substance abuse.\n\n【28】Clinicians need to set limits early and often with these patients. They need to be firm but not punitive. They must keep a constant eye on their own countertransference to these patients， as they can be extremely difficult to work with.\n\n【29】Although patients with this disorder can become psychotic， it is tran-sient， and they do not have signs of a thought disorder or other signs of schizophrenia.\n\n【30】While persistent depressive disorder may often co-occur with BPD， they may often be distinguished by looking at the long-term patterns of behavior and age of onset in the patient in question.\n\n【31】Histrionic personality disordered patients may have rapidly shifting emo-tions， but they do not have the chronic feelings of deep emptiness or loneliness or the constant， angry disruptions in relationships that charac-terize those with borderline personality disorder.\n\n【32】These patients can have other coexisting disorders such as eating disor-ders， major depression， and substance abuse. The specifics of each must be teased out of the multiple signs and symptoms presented by patients with BPD.\n\n【33】Defense mechanisms used by these patients include splitting， projec-tion， projective identification， devaluation， idealization， distortion， and acting out.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

He was born full term and has been generally healthy until a few months ago, when his parents noticed that he became tired after only five minutes of playing with his siblings. Physical examination reveals a loud, holosystolic murmur and mild cyanosis of his lips. Examination of his hands reveals clubbing of the fingers.

This boy most likely suffers from Eisenmenger syndrome, which is demonstrated by the cyanosis and digital clubbing. In Eisenmenger syndrome a ventricular septal defect (VSD), atrial septal defect (ASD), or patent ductus arteriosus causes a left-to-right shunt and thus an acyanotic lesion, which is why he has been asymptomatic for much of his life. Over time the uncorrected shunt reverses as the right ventricle hypertrophies in response to increased pulmonary vascular resistance, and becomes a right-to-left shunt and thus acyanotic heart disease. The resultant low blood oxygen levels can lead to the development of exercise intolerance, cyanosis, and clubbing of the fingers as seen in this patient.  \nAnswer A is incorrect. Patients with bicuspid aortic valves often have no symptoms, but later in life the valve can become calcified, leading to premature aortic stenosis in the fifth and sixth decades. However, bicuspid aortic valve is an unlikely cause of symptoms such as cyanosis and clubbing in a 12-year-old child.  \nAnswer B is incorrect. Before the development of Eisenmenger syndrome, congenital defects such as VSD, ASD, and patent ductus arteriosus produced a left-to-right shunt. However, this boy’s symptoms indicate that the direction of the shunt has reversed.  \nAnswer C is incorrect. Mitral regurgitation classically produces a holosystolic murmur that radiates to the axilla. Although chronic mitral regurgitation can lead to CHF, it is an unlikely cause of symptoms such as cyanosis and clubbing in a 12-year-old child.  \nAnswer E is incorrect.

Tuberous sclerosis has a strong association with tumors such as cortical tubers, renal angiomyolipomas, cardiac rhabdomyomas, astrocytomas, and pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis. Typical skin findings include the ash-leaf spot, Shagreen patch, and facial angiofibromas. Patients with tuberous sclerosis typically present with mental retardation and epilepsy.  \nAnswer A is incorrect . Neurofibromatosis is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in either the NF1 gene on chromosome 17 (neurofibromatosis type 1) or the NF2 gene on chromosome 22 (neurofibromatosis type 2). Patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 have characteristic café-au-lait spots, cutaneous neurofibromas, and Lisch nodules in the iris, along with central nervous system tumors such as optic gliomas and astrocytomas. Patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 have bilateral acoustic neuromas as a characteristic finding, and may present with bilateral tinnitus and hearing loss.  \nAnswer B is incorrect . Leber hereditary optic neuropathy is due to a mitochondrial mutation that causes degeneration of the optic nerve with rapid loss of central vision, leading to a central scotoma that is permanent. More males than females are affected, with symptoms usually starting in the third decade.  \nAnswer D is incorrect . Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by abnormal blood vessel growth. The overgrowth of blood vessels leads to angiomas and hemangioblastomas in the retina, brain, and spinal cord as well as in other regions of the body. Patients also show cystic growths in the kidneys and pancreas, pheochromocytomas (resulting in apparently essential hypertension), islet cell tumors, and clear cell renal carcinoma. The disease is due to deletion of the VHL tumor suppressor gene on the short arm of chromosome 3. Untreated retinal hemangiomas can rupture, leading to retinal detachment.  \nAnswer E is incorrect . Sun sensitivity would be associated with xeroderma pigmentosum, an autosomal recessive disease caused by a deficiency in DNA repair of thymine dimers. Patients are very sensitive to UV radiationinduced thymine dimers, which can cause keratoses, skin cancers, and premature aging. These patients have an increased tendency to develop basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin. Lesions are often seen around the eyes and eyelids.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

You are the  删除换行1 foundation year 2 doctor seeing her and you elicit the history and examine her.\n\n【3】She is 25 years old and pregnant with her second child. Her daughter was born 3 years ago  删除换行1 by emergency caesarean section for failure to progress in labour due to an occipitoposterior  删除换行1 position. The pregnancy had been uncomplicated and she had gone into spontaneous labour  删除换行1 at 40 weeks 5 days. She had contractions for 24 h, and during this time she underwent artificial rupture of membranes and was given a syntocinon infusion for 8 h. The cervix dilated to  删除换行1 8 cm but she did not progress further despite regular strong contractions.\n\n【4】Following the emergency caesarean the baby was well, but the woman was readmitted to hospital after 7 days because of an infected wound haematoma for which she required intravenous antibiotics. The antibiotics altered the taste of the breast milk and the baby subsequently  删除换行1 had to have formula milk.\n\n【5】She now feels anxious that she might have to go through the same experiences again and is  删除换行1 wondering whether she can request an elective caesarean section to avoid having another  删除换行1 long labour and emergency procedure, with its associated complications.\n\n【6】She has had no other pregnancies and is generally fit and healthy. She is currently 16 weeks’  删除换行1 gestation and has had a normal nuchal scan. Booking blood tests are normal.\n\n【7】Examination\n\n【8】The abdomen is distended, compatible with pregnancy. The low transverse scar is visible and  删除换行1 is non-tender. The uterus is palpable to midway between the symphysis pubis and the umbilicus. The fetal heartbeat is heard with a hand-held Doppler machine.\n\n【9】Question\n\n【10】• How should you advise and manage her?\n\n【11】ANSWER 60\n\n【12】The current average caesarean section rate in the UK is approximately 24 per cent. This means  删除换行1 that many women are returning in subsequent pregnancies having had a previous caesarean  删除换行1 section. In this case the woman has an otherwise low-risk pregnancy and the only factor to  删除换行1 be considered at this stage is the planned mode of delivery.\n\n【13】She should be able to make an informed choice after appropriate information regarding vaginal birth after caesarean section versus planned caesarean section.\n\n【14】The important points for this woman to be informed about and to consider are summarized:\n\n【15】• Vaginal birth after caesarean (VBAC):\n\n【16】• successful in up to 70 per cent of cases\n\n【17】• emergency caesarean section rate is approximately 30 per cent\n\n【18】• 1 in 200 risk of uterine rupture (scar dehiscence)\n\n【19】• close cardiotocograph monitoring is needed, with intravenous access, fasting  删除换行1 and full blood count and group and save serum available\n\n【20】• normal progress is expected and augmentation of labour is not usually recommended in women with a uterine scar\n\n【21】• induction of labour may be appropriate in selected women with previous  删除换行1 caesarean section\n\n【22】• Planned caesarean section:\n\n【23】• operative delivery is associated with higher risks of haemorrhage, infection,  删除换行1 visceral damage and thrombosis\n\n【24】• mobility and ability to care for child and baby are more impaired by caesarean  删除换行1 section than vaginal delivery\n\n【25】• planned caesarean does avoid the possibility of an emergency procedure\n\n【26】• after two caesarean sections a further caesarean would be the recommended  删除换行1 option in any subsequent pregnancy\n\n【27】The woman should be offered a further appointment toward the end of the third trimester  删除换行1 to confirm her decision regarding mode of delivery and to check for any complications  删除换行1 that might contraindicate vaginal delivery such as breech presentation, a large baby, scar  删除换行1 tenderness or pre-eclampsia. One of the most important points in the consultation is to  删除换行1 listen to her concerns about the previous delivery and what her fears might be. An empathetic approach will help her to feel confident about any decision she makes this time.\n\n【28】KEY POINTS\n\n【29】• Although low, the maternal morbidity and mortality are higher for caesarean section than for vaginal delivery.\n\n【30】• The chances of a successful vaginal delivery after a previous caesarean section are  删除换行1 up to 70 per cent.\n\n【31】• A woman’s experiences of previous deliveries are very important in counselling for  删除换行1 any subsequent pregnancy and delivery.Case 61: Group B streptococcus", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

It is important to control the habit after 2 years of age. In some patients, the help of a psychologist is valuable.\n\n【14】Digital sucking is responsible for causing significant changes in the maxilla and in the mandible during the growth period.\n\n【15】In general, the maxilla becomes narrow and V shaped, the mandible tends to be retrognathic, and, as a consequence, a significant open bite is developed with proclined upper incisors and retruded lower incisors.\n\n【16】Due to the excessive proclination of the upper incisors, lips become incompetent and the tongue is placed between the upper and lower incisors during the swallowing process, worsening it.\n\n【17】Also, there is a significant link between the respiration mode, the direction of the facial growth, and the development of the malocclusions (posterior cross bite and anterior open bite), due to abnormal contraction of the cheek muscles.\n\n【18】Hypertrophic lymphoid tissues and nasal obstruction in combination with large adenoids and tonsils are the most common cause of nasal obstruction and mouth breathing as they push the tongue forward due to pain and decrease in the amount of posterior space for the tongue.\n\n【19】This atypical swallowing pattern and the anterior posture of the tongue at rest prevent the eruption of the incisors and increase the anterior open bite with lower lip interposition every time the patient swallows.\n\n【20】In general, these young patients are sent to the speech therapist in order to improve the pronunciation of certain words, but it is important to remember that the anterior open bite is the consequence, not the cause.\n\n【21】Also, orofacial and speech dysfunction could be combined with problems at the TMJ that could worsen in the future.\n\n【22】In addition to TMJ problems, episodes of sleep apnea could be added. The child could stop breathing several times during the night (20–40 times per hour of sleep). As a consequence, he or she would feel daytime sleepiness, headaches, fatigue, obesity, changes in personality, lack of attention at school in the morning, etc.\n\n【23】Since sleep apnea is a progressive disorder, the consultation with the specialist is very important from the first day in order to perform a multi- and interdisciplinary treatment plan and avoid relapse (Pascually et al.).\n\n【24】It is important to remember that sleepwalking in young children and enuresis are commonly related to open bite problems.\n\n【25】The real question is who, when, why, and how to treat.\n\n【26】The higher the percentage of environmental factors in relation to the genetic ones, the better the prognosis. Among the deleterious habits, the prolonged use of pacifiers, mouth breathing, or thumb-sucking are determinants. In some patients, the help of a psychologist is fundamental to control the habits.\n\n【27】Unfortunately, there isn’t only one type of appliance to treat all these patients. The appliance selection has to be related to the etiology, age of the patient, seriousness of the problem, etc. The orthodontist is responsible for the appropriate selection.\n\n【28】The decision of whether to use a removable, fixed appliance or a combination of both is related to the etiology and the skeletal maturity in order to maximize the effectiveness of the orthodontic treatment.\n\n【29】The normalization of the vertical dimension is extremely challenging for the orthodontist to control, especially in high-angle patients with mouth breathing.\n\n【30】If problems leading to an open bite could be identified and treated early, it might be possible to minimize or even eliminate an undesirable pattern of growth.\n\n【31】According to the structures affected, anterior open bite can be divided into three main categories: dental, dentoalveolar, and skeletal.\n\n【32】Dental and dentoalveolar open bites develop as a result of prolonged mechanical blockage of the normal vertical development of anterior teeth and alveolar process 删除10：<u>(Torres et al. 2012 )</u>.\n\n【33】The skeletal form, in turn, is characterized by a significant vertical skeletal discrepancy, with features such as counterclockwise rotation of the palatine process, increased lower anterior facial height and gonial angle, short mandibular ramus, and increased posterior dentoalveolar height in both mandible and maxilla.\n\n【34】3.1 Diagnosis\n-------------\n\n【35】   Medical and dental analysis\n   Patients’ chief complaint\n   Evaluation of growth\n   Functional analysis\n   Photographic and radiologic evaluation\n   Vertical facial pattern\n   Unfavorable growth pattern\n\n【36】The treatment goals should include the removal of the etiological and environmental factors to permit the normalization of the anterior growth development.\n\n【37】Until now, no consensus has been reached to determine the best time to initiate the orthopedic/orthodontic treatment. Nonetheless, it is totally accepted that the earlier the correction of the open bite begins, the better the results will be. Also, early treatment helps avoid relapse.\n\n【38】Myofunctional therapy is the best option to normalize mouth breathing.\n\n【39】Control and reduction of the extrusion of the molars are fundamental to allow a counterclockwise rotation of the mandible to maintain the results.\n\n【40】Failure to control bad habits may be the most important reason of relapse.\n\n【41】The role of the otolaryngologist to improve and normalize nasal breathing during the diagnosis process and speech pathology is of prime importance.\n\n【42】In general, anterior open bite in temporary or early mixed dentition is associated with digital sucking habit and tongue anterior interposition.\n\n【43】Its correction is very important since otherwise the problem could worsen and turn into a skeletal alteration.\n\n【44】The size and length of the lips are also important to maintain a proper lip seal during day and night. Also, it is necessary to normalize the position and function of the tongue.\n\n【45】Normally, children who breathe through their mouth have a narrow maxillary arch, protrusive incisors, Class II occlusion, convex facial profile, bags under the eyes, an open mouth posture, and narrow nostrils.\n\n【46】The importance of the multidisciplinary treatment cannot be denied.\n\n【47】Treatment strategies are in close relationship with etiology, facial biotype, age of the patient, and clinical experiences.\n\n【48】The management of the tongue thrust and mouth breathing involves the interception of the habit. First of all, the doctor has to determine that the patient can use his/her nose to breathe normally.\n\n【49】It is important to remember that mouth breathing is abnormal and can affect the whole stomatognathic system, body posture, etc. and not only the position of the teeth.\n\n【50】As soon as this problem is corrected, fewer consequences appear.\n\n【51】Different appliances could be used according to the age of the patient and his/her medical history, in order to establish a new neuromuscular pattern.\n\n【52】According to the etiology and the importance of the problem, removable, fixed, or a combination of both types of appliances can be used.\n\n【53】The orthodontist has the final decision.\n\n【54】The following examples will describe each option in detail.\n\n【55】This 6-year, 8-month-old patient is sent to the office by her family dentist in search of a second opinion regarding her anterior open bite.\n\n【56】An adenoidectomy was performed 4 months earlier.

It also helps to improve dental arch development during the early and late mixed dentition, and most importantly, this appliance helps normalize bad habits.\n\n【83】Also, other types of functional appliances can be used according to the orthodontist’s preferences.

This newborn has Edwards syndrome, or trisomy 18. Affected children are born with clenched fists, “rocker-bottom” feet, micrognathia (a small lower jaw), congenital heart disease, and mental retardation. The survival rate of <1 year is similar to that of trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome), from which it should be distinguished. Trisomy of chromosome 13, or Patau syndrome, is characterized by a constellation of findings including mental retardation, microphthalmia, microcephaly, cleft lip/palate, abnormal forebrain structures, polydactyly, and congenital heart disease.  \nAnswer A is incorrect. F508 deletion in the CFTR gene is the most common cause of cystic fibrosis. Patients with cystic fibrosis have frequent pulmonary infections, impaired mucous clearance, and poor growth secondary to pancreatic involvement. Survival can extend into the fourth and fifth decades in these patients.  \nAnswer B is incorrect. CAG tandem repeats are found in Huntington disease, among others. Huntington is asymptomatic until the patient’s third or fourth decade and is caused by degeneration of the caudate and putamen. Patients present with gradually worsening choreiform (dance-like) movements, but not the birth defects found in this patient.  \nAnswer C is incorrect. This is fragile X syndrome. Associated with CGG tandem repeats, this syndrome is characterized by mental retardation, a large jaw, and large testes. Children with fragile X syndrome typically survive beyond one year of age.  \nAnswer E is incorrect. Down syndrome can cause mental retardation and characteristic physical findings that include microgenia (a small chin), macroglossia, epicanthal folds, and a round face, but clenched fists and “rocker-bottom” feet are classic for trisomy 18.

About a week ago he completed a 14-day course of antibiotics prescribed by his doctor for bacterial sinusitis. He is normally in good health, eats a diet full of fruits and vegetables, and exercises daily. He denies any changes in his diet and has not experienced any gastrointestinal distress, although he admits to tea-colored urine over the past three-four days.

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is an X-linked recessive disorder that is particularly common in African-American males. Individuals of Mediterranean heritage are also affected. G6PD is the first enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway, and it reduces oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucelotide phosphate to reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucelotide phosphate (NADPH) as it oxidizes glucose-6-phosphate. NADPH is a necessary cofactor for the enzyme glutathione reductase, which generates reduced glutathione. Reduced glutathione, in turn, can reduce peroxides into less harmful substances such as water and alcohol. A deficiency of G6PD makes erythrocytes more susceptible to oxidative stress, resulting in a hemolytic anemia that can be triggered by antibiotics such as sulfa drugs or bacterial infections. Heinz bodies are a hallmark of G6PD deficiency; they represent accumulations of denatured hemoglobin in affected red blood cells.  \nAnswer A is incorrect . α-thalassemia is caused by a defect in one or more of the four α-globin chains of hemoglobin. Symptoms range in severity from silent carriers who have no detectable changes on a complete blood count to in utero fatalities. However, these are typically constant conditions that are not precipitated by infection or medications.  \nAnswer B is incorrect . Blood donation would not be expected to cause anemia in a healthy individual, and there is no reason to believe that this patient has recently donated blood.  \nAnswer C is incorrect . Folic acid deficiency can result in a megaloblastic anemia. This type of deficiency is often seen in alcoholics or individuals with poor nutrition, neither of which is present in this patient.  \nAnswer E is incorrect . Intrinsic factor (IF) deficiency causes pernicious anemia. IF is synthesized in the stomach, and a deficiency results from destruction of those cells. However, there is no reason to believe that this patient has suffered from any autoimmune attack on gastric cells. Pernicious anemia also causes a megaloblastic anemia, not seen here.  \nAnswer F is incorrect . Iron deficiency anemia is one of the most common causes of anemia but is not likely in this patient given the presentation. It is typically observed in menstruating women.  \nAnswer G is incorrect .

This patient presents with erythema nodosum (EN), which is a form of panniculitis that is considered to be a delayed hypersensitivity reaction. It can occur at any age and is seen equally across different sex and races. Erythema nodosum characteristically presents as painful erythematous subcutaneous nodules, most often located symmetrically on the anterior shins, thighs and forearms. Occasionally, systemic symptoms can be associated with EN, including arthritis, arthralgia, fever and malaise.\n\n【9】ii. Erythema nodosum is often observed in the setting of various systemic diseases, although the largest proportion of cases (up to 50%) is categorized as idiopathic. Infections are common causes of EN, most commonly streptococcal infections and less often, bacterial gastroenteritis and viral upper respiratory tract infections. Other causes of EN include drugs such as estrogens and oral contraceptives, penicillin and biologic agents, sarcoidosis and inflammatory bowel disease, with a stronger association observed between EN and Crohn’s disease than with ulcerative colitis. Less common causes of EN include Chlamydia trachomatis infections, Mycoplasma pneumonia infections, tuberculosis, hepatitis B, Sweet’s syndrome and pregnancy.\n\n【10】In the setting of Crohn’s disease, EN can be seen prior to or contemporaneously with a flare. The presence of EN is considered as a prognostic factor in some instances; EN is associated with a more benign and self-limited form of sarcoidosis.\n\n【11】iii. The treatment of uncomplicated, mild EN consists of bed rest, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and potassium iodide. For more severe cases, colchicine, prednisone, dapsone and hydroxychloroquine have been used with success in a small series of patients.

These  删除换行1 are transported in plasma in association with proteins, with free fatty acids carried by albumin and other lipids circulating in complexes, termed lipoproteins, that have a non-polar lipid  删除换行1 core and a surface layer of phospholipids, cholesterol and apolipoproteins. Lipoproteins are  删除换行1 classified based on their density, increasing from chylomicrons to very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs), intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDLs), low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) and  删除换行1 high-density lipoproteins (HDLs). As density increases, less TG is present, with increasing  删除换行1 amounts of cholesterol and proteins.\nChylomicrons are formed from dietary fat, and their function is to transport TG to the tissues. VLDLs are the primary transport mode for endogenous TG, and as TGs are released  删除换行1 to tissues by the action of lipoprotein lipase, they become denser to form IDL and then LDL.\nLDL carries the majority of plasma cholesterol, which may be taken up by macrophages, a  删除换行1 pathogenic event of atherosclerosis.

The metabolism of HDL is complex, but essentially it mediates ‘reverse cholesterol  删除换行1 transport’ by taking up cholesterol from senescent cells and transferring it to remnant lipoprotein particles that are eventually cleared by the liver.\nHyperlipidaemia is one of the key modifiable risk factors for the development of atherosclerosis. It may either be primary, arising from a genetic disorder, or secondary to other conditions, including hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, obesity, nephrotic syndrome, renal and  删除换行1 liver failure, drugs (e.g. thiazides, antiretrovirals) and alcohol.\nIn this case, the man has high levels of total and LDL cholesterol.

He needs rapid-sequence intubation (RSI) with MV. Because of the ARDS， a low V strategy of 6 to8 mL/kg with a plateau pressure <30 mm Hg is indicated. The ETT should be sized8 mm or more to allow fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) to evaluate for any aspirated material while maintaining MV. Hypothermia may alter the patient's neurologi-cal status， which cannot be accurately evaluated until core temperature correction. When the chest x-ray shows atelectasis or pulmonary volume loss， especially with high ventilation pressures， an obstruction of the bronchi should be suspected. FOB should be considered to determine if sand or other foreign objects were aspirated.Continuous oxymetry reading is standard in all MV patients. The goal is to keep O， saturation equal or exceeding 90%， which equals a PAo， of 60 mm Hg. This is a time-tested goal of oxygenation and the elbow of the hemoglobin disassociation curve. An improving or normal neurological status is a secondary predictor of a good outcome. Interestingly， most near-drowning victims suffer more from asphyxiation(pharyngeal spasm from fear of breathing under water) and dry lungs rather than aspiration of water and wet lungs. Increased levels of PEEP and 100% Fio， may be required to maintain this O，sat goal 删除25：<u></u>. PEEP can prevent the col lapse of small airways and alveoli by maintaining alveolar recruitment.

The best choice is the one that delivers and meets the physiologic needs for oxygenation and ventilation while maintaining patient comfort and decreasing the need for sedation.Medications commonly used in MV include p， agonists， ipratropium bromide， steroids， antibiotics， and mucolytics. Invasive ventilation with MV is needed when noninvasive ventilation (NIV) fails or in situations requiring airway control. Patients intubated for respiratory failure develop respiratory muscle fatigue， and muscle retraining is required. Muscular dysfunction must be reversed. Anxiety， which is the most common treatable side effect of MV， can be minimized with pressure support MV and using patient-driven MV modes (SIMV). SIMV is associated with improved synchronization between the patient's natural breathing pattern and the MV. The respiratory demand and the amount of required ventilator support determines the mode of ventilation 删除25：<u></u>.\n\nAssist control ventilationisusually the initial M Vmode since delivery of a backup respiratory rate and minute ventilation is assured regardless of patient contribution. SIMV or IMV are equivalent since all IMV devices are synchronized. The main goal of MV is to supply needed ventilation and oxygenation by retrainingand strengthen-ing the respiratory system and resting the fatigued respiratory muscles. An eventual goal is to exercise the rested muscle to allow successful extubation. Extubation is considered as successful when reintubation is not required within the next 48 hours.| Table 9-2· GENERAL PRINCIPLES TO MECHANICAL VENTILATORS AND THEIR MODES  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Positive pressure breathdelivery， positive intrathoracicpressure during inspiration  | Can be triggered by patient，set by MV， or both  | Fio。 V， flow rates， PEEP， PS，IPAP，EPAP can be delivered， measured，and monitored by the MV  |\n\n【10】recognition of new infiltrates， the development of barotrauma， and the placement of central venous line， but also in detecting abnormalities of NGT or feeding tubes. The extension of the chin away from the chest can move the ETT down and selec-tively intubate the right main stem bronchus. In contrast， flexion of the chin toward the chest can pull the ETT up and extubate the patient if the ETT is not properly placed. The recommended placement of the tip of the ETT is 3 to 4 cm above the carina (T level) to avoid these changes due to chin placement.\n\n【11】In AC， MV breaths are delivered at a preset rate and tidal volume. If a spontane-ous breath is not generated within a specified time， a mechanical breath will be delivered at a scheduled time period depending on the rate set. For example， the MV will cycle a breath every 3 seconds for set rate of 20 breaths/minute， even if no spontaneous breath occurs within that minute. The patient can only breathe and receive MV breaths above the set rate， but never below it. Lack of coordina-tion of the patient's breathing with the MV breaths may cause significant patient discomfort and an increase in the work of breathing 删除33：<u></u>.\n\n【12】The goals of MV are to provide adequate minute ventilation (V=rate×V) and minimize the risk of barotrauma. In an AC mode， if the patient breathes above the set MV respiratory rate， the machine will deliver another full MV breath which can lead to an acute respiratory alkalosis. Tachypnea on the AC MV mode can lead to the stacking of MV breaths with trapping of air as the expiratory time decreases. This results in auto PEEP. Intrinsic and auto PEEP are factors of fast respiratory rates and shorter exhalation times (reverse I-E ratios). If during exhalation the pressure does not return to baseline 通用删除7(英):<u>(0)</u>， this intrinsic PEEP increases the inspiratory effort； the patient's next inspiratory effort must overcome this new baseline pressure to initiate the next spontaneous breath. Lengthening the expiratory time by decreas-ing the volume or rate alleviates this problem and decreases the intrinsic PEEP/auto PEEP. Disconnecting a patient from the MV circuit loses the PEEP and the alveoli that had been recruited. These alveoli will now collapse and are difficult to re expand. Should this auto PEEP be the cause of hemodynamic deterioration， the dis-connecting maneuver can be life saving. Intravascular volume should be increased with fluids and PEEP levels should be decreased.SIMV is similar to AC， except that breaths that are spontaneously generated by the patient occur without activating an MV breath. Breaths initiated by the patient are only in the Vamount generated by the patient and not by the MV. Both ventilator breaths and spontaneous breaths generated by the patient can be assisted with pressure support ventilation (PSV). SIMV should not be used alone without PSV since this actually increases the work of breathing. SIMV of at least 5 cm H，O of PS should be applied. All IMV are synchronized to keep a ventilator breath from pushing against a patient's natural or forced exhalation. This will avoid possible barotrauma and pneu-mothorax (PTX) secondary to increased intra bronchial pressures.Figure 9-1. Mechanical ventilator modes.

New York， NY： McGraw-Hill Education； 2007； Figure 20-20.)</u>Pressure support ventilation (PSV) and pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) were originally designed for weaning or liberating the patient from MV. These modalities should be used in combination when SIMV is used， since SIMV needs a support mode. In PSV， the patient is spontaneously breathing and each patient breath is assisted by a preset amount of“pressure support”measured in centimeter H，O. Pressures can be set for inhalation and exhalation， as well as for continuous or intermittent applica-tion. With increased inhalation pressure， V increases. This effect usually reaches a maximum at pressures of 25 to 30 cm H，O. PSV acts as an assist device that allows the patient to establish the Vand respiratory rate at levels which are most comfortable. This mode does not require much sedation.Airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) is another form of MV that allows patients to breathe spontaneously over intermittent and variable levels of CPAP. APRV may be thought of as alternating levels of CPAP with or without pressure sup-port. APRV allows patients to breathe spontaneously over intermittent and alter-nating levels of CPAP. These alternating levels of CPAP are termed， at the higher level (Phigh)， which is a recruiting maneuver， and with an alternating lower set pres-sure (P) or PEEP， which maintains patency of the recruited airways. In an APRV， the inspiratory cycle is set by the length of the inspiratory time. For example， cycle time of 6 seconds=RR of 10 breaths/minute (60 sec/6 sec=10cycles). APVR works best at respiratory rates of <15 breaths/minute， preferably near 12 breaths/minute or less. Alveoli are recruited， preventing their collapse， by the continuous pressure set and maintained by APVR.agents has significant neurological sequelae in patients who eventually recovered. A small V is delivered at very high respiratory rates in the range of 180 to 600 breaths/minute. The HFOV or jet ventilation is an alternative mode of MV that protects the lungs. Most clinical trials on HFOV have been performed on neonates. Awareness of the injurious effects of mechanical ventilation has led to a renewed interest and advances in using HFOV in adult ALI/ARDS patients. HFOV is characterized by rapid oscillations of a diaphragm (at frequencies of 3-10 Hz， ie， 180-600 breaths/minute) driven by a piston pump.A propofol syndrome has been described about 1% of patients， consisting of rhabdomyolysis and metabolic acidosis. Propofol produces sedation without caus-ing respiratory depression which makes MV easier to deliver. Paralytic agents should be avoided unless absolutely necessary because of its frequent neurological sequelae.</u>\nAcid suppression with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or H， antagonist is recom-mended to prevent GI bleeding from gastric sources； the main drawback is increased bacterial overgrowth because of the acid suppression， leading to aspiration pneu-monia with potentially antibiotic-resistant pathogens.

Also, they have chronic haemolytic anaemia, so they need regular folic acid to  删除换行1 maintain a supply to the newly formed red blood cells.\nThis patient is likely suffering from a painful (vaso-occlusive) sickle cell crisis precipitated  删除换行1 by a viral infection. Pain needs to be controlled. The first line is regular paracetamol and  删除换行1 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). If the mother already tried them, then  删除换行1 codeine phosphate could be given. Some patients with sickle cell disease have severe painful  删除换行1 episodes, which can be quite frequent and require hospital admission. Morphine should be  删除换行1 used promptly for such patients.\nIn addition to analgesia, patients must have adequate hydration and oxygenation because  删除换行1 the polymerisation of Hb-S is influenced by the oxygenation status and dehydration. Start  删除换行1 intravenous fluids if oral hydration is not adequate.If there is any suspicion of bacterial infection, antibiotics must be started. Haemoglobin baseline level varies between patients with sickle cell disease, but they tend to have lower levels  删除换行1 than the rest of the population. This patient’s haemoglobin level is borderline low, and it  删除换行1 needs to be monitored closely. Most physicians would transfuse if it drops below 60 g/L  删除换行5 in sickle cell disease. This needs to be anticipated, and thus a sample is usually sent to the  删除换行1 blood transfusion lab on admission. Importantly, since some of these patients need recurrent  删除换行1 blood transfusions over their lifetime, the laboratory would usually give extended phenotype  删除换行1 matching blood units. This means they are matched not only for the ABO and RhD blood  删除换行1 groups but for other blood groups as well. This is to reduce the risk of developing antibodies  删除换行1 against these other blood groups, which would lead to difficulty in finding suitable units of  删除换行1 blood to transfuse the patient in the future.\nOne of the severe complications of sickle cell disease is stroke, which can be silent in children.\nThis patient needs an MRI of the brain to exclude this and a referral to a paediatric haematologist for long-term follow-up and a secondary prevention programme to protect against  删除换行1 further brain damage.\n\n【16】 KEY POINTS \n\n【17】• Sickle cell disease is an inherited chronic haemolytic anaemia.\n• Infections can precipitate painful episodes from vaso-occlusion, and they need  删除换行1 prompt treatment.\n• Other long-term complications of the disease need to be addressed: chronic haemolytic state, vaccination and reducing the risk of cerebrovascular disease.\n• Psychological support and family education are vital in such chronic conditions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

His serum sodium level is initially 116 mEq/L and is corrected to 120 mEq/L over the next 3 hours with hypertonic saline. Which of the following factors most likely led to his hyponatremia?\n\n【1】A. Elevation of serum vasopressin\n\n【2】B. Administration of hypertonic solutions\n\n【3】C. Volume depletion\n\n【4】D. Seizure-induced hyponatremia\n\n【5】Answer: 5.1 A. In the postoperative state or in situations where the patient is in pain, the serum vasopressin level may rise, leading to inappropriate retention of free water, which leads to dilution of the serum. Concomitant administration of hypotonic fluids may exacerbate the situation.\n\n【6】Question: 5.2 A 56-year-old man presents to the doctor for the first time complaining of fatigue and weight loss. He has never had any health problems, but he has smoked a pack of cigarettes per day for about 35 years. He is a day laborer and is currently homeless and living in a shelter. His physical examination is notable for a low to normal blood pressure, skin hyperpigmentation, and digital clubbing. He appears euvolemic. You tell him you are not sure of the problem as yet, but you will draw some blood tests and schedule him for follow-up in a week. The laboratory calls that night and informs you that the patient’s sodium level is 126 mEq/L, potassium level is 6.7 mEq/L, creatinine level is normal, and bicarbonate and chloride levels are low. Which of the following is the likely cause of his hyponatremia given his presentation?\n\n【7】A. SIADH\n\n【8】B. Hypothyroidism\n\n【9】C. Gastrointestinal losses\n\n【10】D. Adrenal insufficiency\n\n【11】E. Renal insufficiency\n\n【12】Answer: 5.2 D. Hyponatremia in the setting of hyperkalemia and acidosis (low bicarbonate level) is suspicious for adrenal insufficiency. This patient’s examination is also suggestive of the diagnosis, given his complaints of fatigue, weight loss, low blood pressure, and hyperpigmentation. The diagnosis is made by a 24-hour urine cortisol test or by measuring the response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation, showing low cortisol levels. The underlying cause of the adrenal gland destruction in this patient probably is either tuberculosis or malignancy.\n\n【13】Question: 5.3 An 83-year-old woman comes to your clinic complaining of a headache and mild confusion. Her medical history is remarkable only for hypertension, which is well controlled with hydrochlorothiazide. Her examination and laboratory tests show no signs of infection, but her serum sodium level is 119 mEq/L, and plasma osmolarity is 245 mOsm/kg. She appears to be clinically hypovolemic. Which of the following is the best initial therapy?\n\n【14】A. Fluid restriction\n\n【15】B. Infusion of 0.9% saline\n\n【16】C. Infusion of 3% saline\n\n【17】D. Infusion of 3% saline with furosemide\n\n【18】Answer: 5.3 B. Because the patient is hypovolemic, probably as a result of the use of diuretics, volume replacement with isotonic saline is the best initial therapy. Hyponatremia caused by thiazide diuretics can occur by several mechanisms, including volume depletion. It is most common in elderly women.\n\n【19】Question: 5.4 A 58-year-old man has undergone a lengthy colon cancer surgery. On the first postoperative day, he is noted to have significant hyponatremia with a sodium level of 128 mEq/L. You suspect that the hyponatremia is due to the intravenous infusion of hypotonic solution. Which of the following laboratory findings supports your diagnosis?\n\n【20】A. Urine sodium >20 mmol/L\n\n【21】B. Urine osmolality >200 mOsm/L\n\n【22】C. Serum osmolarity <280 mOsm/kg\n\n【23】D. Serum potassium >5.0 mEq/L\nAnswer: 5.4 C. In a patient with hyponatremia due to the infusion of excessive hypotonic solution, the serum osmolarity should be low. The kidneys in responding normally should attempt to retain sodium and excrete water; hence, the urine sodium concentration should be low, and the urine osmolality should be low. When the infusion of hypotonic solution is used, the serum potassium level will also be low. This is in contrast to a situation of mineralocorticoid deficiency in which the sodium level will be decreased and potassium level may be elevated. Similarly, hyperaldosteronism can lead to hypertension and hypokalemia (Conn syndrome).\n\n【24】CLINICAL PEARLS\n\n【25】 Hyponatremia almost always occurs by impairment of free water excretion.\n\n【26】 SIADH is a diagnosis of exclusion. Criteria include euvolemic patient, urine that is not maximally dilute (osmolality >150–200 mmol/L), urine sodium >20 mmol/L, and normal adrenal and thyroid function.\n\n【27】 Hypovolemic patients with hyponatremia should be treated with volume replacement, typically with isotonic (0.9%) saline.\n\n【28】 Euvolemic patients with asymptomatic hyponatremia can be treated with fluid restriction. Patients with severe symptoms, such as coma or seizures, can be treated with hypertonic (3%) saline.\n\n【29】 The rate of sodium correction generally should not exceed 0.5–1 mEq/h; otherwise central pontine myelinolysis (osmotic demyelination) can occur.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

He has recently developed impotence, and his grandchildren have started to tease him about his droopy eyes. He reports that his balance is worse in darkness or when he closes his eyes. He has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease and migraine headaches. He is only taking over-the-counter famotidine (Pepcid) and a multivitamin each day. He has been married for 35 years and is a retired structural engineer. He has not been exposed to toxins, does not smoke, or drink alcohol. The only other pertinent information is that he served as a natural disaster relief volunteer overseas before getting married and contracted a “venereal disease.” He thinks he contracted syphilis and received oral antibiotics.

His examination is notable for cranial nerve impairment with Argyll Robertson pupils and ptosis. Other findings included impaired posterior column function with loss of proprioception in the feet and impaired lateral spinothalamic tract function (loss of temperature and pinprick). His deep tendon reflexes are diminished in the legs, and he has a sensory ataxia. The Romberg test is positive.\n\n【8】• Most likely diagnosis : Tabes dorsalis (spinal form of syphilis).\n\n【9】• Confirm the diagnosis : Lumbar puncture for Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL).\n\n【10】• Next therapeutic step : High-dose intravenous aqueous penicillin G at a dose of 2-million to 4-million units every 4 hours for 10 to 14 days. If there is a penicillin allergy then doxycycline at a dose of 200 mg twice a day for 28 days and ceftriaxone at a dose of 2 g intravenously per day for 14 days are administered.\n\n【11】#### ANALYSIS\n\n【12】##### Objectives\n\n【13】1\\. Be familiar with the clinical presentation of tabes dorsalis and other neurologic syndromes caused by syphilis.\n\n【14】2\\. Know how to diagnose tabes dorsalis and differentiate it from other late forms of neurosyphilis.\n\n【15】3\\. Know how to treat tabes dorsalis.\n\n【16】##### Considerations\n\n【17】Any individual with a history of syphilis that presents with neurologic symptoms should alert the clinician to possible neurosyphilis. Other etiologies need to be excluded and other sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV or hepatitis B or C can also cause similar neurologic symptoms. Lancinating pain with associated sensory ataxia, cranial nerve abnormalities, and impotence or bowel and bladder dysfunction is a classical presentation for tabes dorsalis. In this particular case, tabes dorsalis is the most likely diagnosis; however, to diagnose it, confirmation from laboratory studies must be obtained. The most common serologic studies requested are a rapid plasma reagin (RPR) assay or VDRL test. These are quite sensitive for primary and secondary syphilis; however, they are less sensitive for neurosyphilis. A negative RPR does not exclude neurosyphilis. Importantly the RPR assay can frequently have false-positive results. If these tests are positive, proceed in confirming the diagnosis in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). The following indicates the typical CSF findings of neurosyphilis:\n\n【18】• Elevated CSF protein up to 200 mg/dL\n\n【19】• Lymphocytic pleocytosis <400/µL\n\n【20】• CSF VDRL positivity in most individuals\n\n【21】• Elevated IgG synthesis\n\n【22】If however the RPR or VDRL studies are negative and neurosyphilis is still clinically suspected, serum studies for Treponema pallidum \\-specific antibodies should be performed. These include fluorescent treponemal antibody absorbed (FTA-ABS) test, T pallidum hemagglutination (TPHA) test, or microhemagglutination assay- T pallidum (MHA-TP). These studies are much more expensive than the reaginic assays but are much more sensitive for neurosyphilis. In fact if these studies are nonreactive, neurosyphilis is excluded.\n\n【23】Detection of T pallidum by polymerase chain reaction in the CSF is quite low. Importantly, the serologic studies cannot distinguish between syphilis, pinta, and yaws due to cross reactivity. HIV or hepatitis B and C can present with very similar symptoms of sensory ataxia, cranial mononeuropathies, and pain. A distinguishing feature between these infections and neurosyphilis is the type of pain. The classical lancinating pain is seen with neurosyphilis, whereas a burning type pain is associated with the others. Nevertheless, laboratory studies are the only way to distinguish these conditions.\n\n【24】### APPROACH TO: Tabes Dorsalis\n\n【25】#### DEFINITIONS\n\n【26】ARGYLL ROBERTSON PUPILS : Small pupils that constrict when focusing but fail to constrict when exposed to bright light (accommodate but do not react).\n\n【27】ELECTROMYOGRAPH (EMG)/NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES : An electrophysiological examination that evaluates the integrity of the peripheral nerve and evaluates various electrical muscle properties allowing the clinician to determine the presence of either a muscle or nerve disorder. This test is useful in evaluating primarily the peripheral nervous system.\n\n【28】H REFLEX : The H reflex is the electrical equivalent to a monosynaptic stretch reflex. It often reflects pathology along the afferent and efferent fibers and/or the dorsal root ganglion.\n\n【29】LANCINATING PAIN : A sensation of piercing, stabbing, or cutting.\n\n【30】PTOSIS : Droopiness of the eyelids.\n\n【31】ROMBERG SIGN : Falling over when a person is standing with eyes closed, feet together, and hands in the outstretched position.\n\n【32】#### CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【33】Neurosyphilis is an infection of the nervous system by the spirochete T pallidum , the organism responsible for syphilis. It is estimated that up to 10% of patients with primary syphilis that have not received treatment will develop neurosyphilis. In the HIV population the percentage of this is higher. Risk factors for syphilis include drug consumption, sexual habits, and social background. Importantly, syphilis is a risk factor for acquiring HIV. It is well recognized that HIV patients with syphilis are at increased risk for developing neurosyphilis and may do so earlier than HIV-negative individuals. Neurosyphilis is twice as common in men as it is in women.\n\n【34】T pallidum can first be detected clinically approximately 3 weeks after infection by the presence of a primary lesion on the skin or mucous membranes (primary syphilis). Secondary syphilis results from a second bacteremic stage with generalized mucocutaneous lesions. Although neurosyphilis (tertiary syphilis) may not present until many years after a primary infection, T pallidum enters the central nervous system at the same time that individuals develop primary and secondary syphilis. Pathogenic changes consist of endarteritis of terminal arterioles with resultant inflammatory and necrotic changes. In the central nervous system, T pallidum causes meningeal inflammation, arteritis of small- and medium-sized vessels with subsequent fibrotic occlusion, and eventually direct neuronal damage.\n\n【35】The clinical features of neurosyphilis are dependent on the time period after infection 删除25：<u></u>. Hyporeflexia is the most common finding on clinical examination with up to 50% of patients with neurosyphilis having this finding. Other clinical findings include sensory impairment (48%), pupillary changes (43%) including Argyll Robertson pupils, cranial neuropathy (36%), dementia or psychiatric symptoms (35%), and positive Romberg test (24%). The Argyll Robertson pupil is almost pathognomonic for neural syphilis . Tabes dorsalis is caused by the syphilitic involvement of the spinal cord, leading to intermittent pain of the arms and legs, ataxia and gait disturbance as a result of loss of position sense, and impaired vibratory and position sense.\n删除4：<u>Table 30–1 • NEUROLOGIC FORMS OF SYPHILIS</u>\n\n【36】The diagnosis of neurosyphilis is made on clinical grounds and confirmed by CSF serology (RPR or VDRL). Usually the CSF protein and cell count are abnormal. The differential diagnosis of neurosyphilis is based on the clinical features. For example, the differential for gummatous neurosyphilis consists of the differential diagnosis for space-occupying lesions (metastatic brain tumors, primary brain tumors, etc). Meningovascular syphilis presenting like a stroke merits the differential diagnosis of cerebral vascular accident (vasculitis, hemorrhage, etc). Three disorders should be considered in the differential diagnosis of tabes dorsalis: subacute combined degeneration from vitamin B <sub class=\"calibre12\">12 </sub> deficiency, multiple sclerosis, and Lyme disease. Other less common diagnoses in the differential include sarcoidosis, herpes zoster, and diffuse metastatic disease. The finding of an Argyll Robertson pupil is highly suggestive of tabes dorsalis but can also be seen with multiple sclerosis, diabetes mellitus, sarcoidosis, Lyme disease, and Wernicke encephalopathy. Tabes dorsalis is a slow and progressive disease that causes demyelination in the posterior columns and inflammatory changes in the posterior roots of the spinal cord. Nerve conduction studies can show impaired sensory nerve conduction studies with normal motor nerve conductions. EMG is normal, but absent H reflexes are common due to the damage of the dorsal root ganglion. Abnormalities in motor nerve conduction studies should raise doubt on the diagnosis of tabes dorsalis.\n\n【37】The treatment of neurosyphilis consists of high-dose intravenous aqueous penicillin G at a dose of 2-million to 4-million units every 4 hours for 10 to 14 days. If there is a penicillin allergy then doxycycline at a dose of 200 mg twice a day for 28 days and ceftriaxone at a dose of 2 g intravenously per day for 14 days are administered. Although there are alternate regimens that have been tried in treating patients with neurosyphilis, they have not been found to be as effective as the use of aqueous penicillin G. Use of intramuscular procaine penicillin at a dose of 2.4-million units intramuscularly every day plus oral probenecid for 10 to 14 days has been tried in those individuals that cannot receive intravenous preparations. This has typically been combined with intramuscular Benzathine penicillin G at a dose of 2.4 million units weekly for 3 weeks. If treatment fails to improve symptoms (for early neurosyphilis) or there is continued progression of symptoms (late neurosyphilis), retreatment should be considered. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies should be reexamined after the completion of therapy with a drop in white blood cell count, protein, and IgG synthesis sought.\n\n【38】##### Prognosis\n\n【39】Outcomes are based on the type of neurosyphilis and how early in the course of the disease patients are diagnosed and treated. Patients with asymptomatic neurosyphilis or meningeal neurosyphilis usually return to normal health. Patients with meningovascular syphilis, general paresis, or tabes dorsalis usually do not return to normal health, although improvement is seen. Delayed treatment many years after onset usually is associated with a worse prognosis. Treatment outcome is different for every person.\n\n【40】####", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Be able to counsel patients on therapeutic lifestyle changes to lower their cholesterol levels.\n\n【16】#### Considerations\n\n【17】This case illustrates a 56-year-old man with well-controlled hypertension and total cholesterol 242 mg/dL; triglycerides 138 mg/dL; high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol 48 mg/dL; and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol 155 mg/dL. The main cholesterol component that impacts on cardiovascular disease is the LDL level. Because this individual has a cardiovascular risk factor score of 2 (age and LDL), this patient’s LDL goal is 130 mg/dL. Initially therapeutic lifestyle changes should be used such as weight loss, exercise, and diet, and then the fasting lipid panel should be repeated in 6 weeks. At the repeat visit, if the LDL cholesterol continues to be elevated, then discussion of pharmacologic therapy should ensue.\n\n【18】### APPROACH TO:  \nHigh Cholesterol\n\n【19】### DEFINITIONS\n\n【20】ATP III: The third report of the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on the Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults.\n\n【21】HDL CHOLESTEROL: High-density lipoprotein cholesterol.\n\n【22】LDL CHOLESTEROL: Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.\n\n【23】STATIN: Medication in the beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA)–reductase inhibitor class. These are the most widely used medications for lowering LDL cholesterol.\n\n【24】### CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【25】It is important to remember that cholesterol is not a disease; however, high cholesterol is a risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD). As such, an individual’s cholesterol levels must be interpreted in the context of their overall risks for CHD . The recommended intensity with which we want to lower someone’s cholesterol level should be proportionate to their risk of CHD: the higher one’s risk, the lower the cholesterol goal. To do this, one must first learn what these major risks are.\n\n【26】Someone with known CHD has a greater than 20% risk of having another CHD event in 10 years. Persons with other forms of atherosclerotic disease (peripheral arterial disease, cerebrovascular disease, or abdominal aortic aneurysm), type 2 diabetes, or multiple risk factors that together raise the risk of CHD to greater than or equal to 20% in 10 years, are said to have a CHD risk equivalent. People with known CHD or CHD risk equivalents have the highest risk of future CHD events and, therefore, their cholesterol targets are the lowest . Similarly, someone with one or fewer risk factors for CHD is at low risk of having a CHD event. These people usually have a less than 10% risk of a CHD event in 10 years. In this population, the recommended lipid levels are not as low.\n\n【27】A third population is one with intermediate risk when compared to the previous two groups. They have two or more risks factors, but a CHD risk between 10% and 20%. In this population, an individual risk should be calculated. Numerous risk calculators are available online or for download into a PDA (personal digital assistant). One is available from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood institute at 删除9：<u>www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/cholesterol/index.htm.</u> By determining the individual risk of CHD, one can then determine an appropriate lipid goal for that patient.\n\n【28】### DETERMINATION OF LIPID GOAL\n\n【29】Numerous studies show that LDL cholesterol is a major risk for developing CHD and that lowering LDL cholesterol can reduce this risk . For these reasons, the ATP III guidelines focus on the identification of those with high LDL cholesterol, the determination of that individual’s risk of CHD, and development of an appropriate management plan to reach LDL cholesterol goals.\n\n【30】These guidelines recommend measuring lipid levels in all adults older than age 20 years every 5 years. The test performed can be either a fasting lipid panel (total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol; triglycerides) or a nonfasting total and HDL cholesterol, with subsequent fasting lipid panel if either total cholesterol is over 200 mg/dL or if HDL cholesterol is less than 40 mg/dL. Table 35–1 lists the ATP III classification of lipid levels.\n删除4：<u>Table 35–1 • ATP III CLASSIFICATION OF LIPID LEVELS</u>\n\n【31】LDL cholesterol is the primary goal of management. Along with the presence of CHD or a CHD risk equivalent, the following five factors are considered to determine the LDL goal of a given individual:\n\n【32】1\\. Cigarette smoking\n\n【33】2\\. Hypertension (blood pressure ≥140/90 mm Hg or on antihypertensive medication)\n\n【34】3\\. Low HDL\n\n【35】4\\. Age (≥45 years for men; ≥55 years for women)\n\n【36】5\\. Family history of premature CHD (male first-degree relative ≥55 years of age; female first-degree relative ≤65 years of age)\n\n【37】A high HDL level is considered a negative risk, which removes one other risk factor from the total.\n\n【38】The LDL cholesterol goal is based upon the evaluation of these risks. A person with CHD or a CHD risk equivalent has an LDL goal of 100 mg/dL or less. Someone with zero to one identified risks has an LDL goal of 160 mg/dL or less. An individual with two or more risks should have an individual risk assessment performed, using a risk calculator. If someone has two or more risk factors and an individual risk of between 10% and 20%, that person’s LDL goal is 130 mg/dL or less. However, if the individual risk is greater than or equal to 20%, that person should be treated as having a CHD equivalent, with a goal LDL of less than 100 mg/dL .\n删除4：<u>Table 35–2 • MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES TO REACH LDL GOALS</u>\n\n【39】An update to the ATP III was issued in 2004 with an interpretation of some more recent clinical trials. This update suggests a “therapeutic option” of a very low LDL goal of less than 70 mg/dL for those patients at very high risk of CHD . This very-high-risk category includes people with CHD and either multiple major risk factors (especially diabetes), poorly controlled risk factors (especially smoking), multiple risk factors of metabolic syndrome 删除25：<u></u>, or an acute coronary syndrome.\n\n【40】Triglycerides are considered a risk factor also. According to the American Heart Association, optimal fasting levels are <100 mg/dL, normal levels <150 mg/dL, borderline 150-199 mg/dL, high 200-499 mg/dL and very high 500 mg/dL or higher. Lifestyle changes and fish oil supplements are the mainstay of therapy for cardiovascular disease. Little evidence for pharmacotherapy beyond these measures is available.\n\n【41】#### Evaluation\n\n【42】When high blood cholesterol is identified, an investigation should be performed to evaluate for secondary causes of dyslipidemia . Included among these causes are diabetes, hypothyroidism, obstructive liver disease, and chronic renal failure . Consequently, a reasonable laboratory workup includes fasting blood glucose, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), liver enzymes, and a creatinine level. Certain medications, including progestins, anabolic steroids, and corticosteroids, also can result in elevated cholesterol. Consideration should be given to changing or discontinuing these when possible.\n\n【43】#### Management\n\n【44】Therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLCs) are the cornerstone of all treatments for hyperlipidemia . All patients should be educated on healthier living, including dietary modifications, increased physical activity, and smoking cessation. Weight reduction should be encouraged.\n\n【45】Specific dietary recommendations should include a reduction of saturated fats to less than 7% of total calories and an intake of less than 200 mg/d of cholesterol . Total dietary fat should be kept to no more than 35% of total calories, with less than 10% polyunsaturated fat. Trans fats should be kept as low as possible.\n\n【46】When dietary restriction alone does not lead to adequate LDL reduction, the addition of dietary soluble fiber and plant stanols/sterols can be beneficial. Soluble fiber 10 to 25 g and of plant stanols/sterols 2 g can be added to aid in cholesterol reduction. Referral to a dietician may be helpful as well.\n\n【47】When TLC is instituted, regular follow-up must be arranged. Fasting lipids should be rechecked in approximately 6 weeks. If adequate reduction has occurred, reinforcement of the lifestyle changes should be given and the patient followed every 4 to 6 months.\n\n【48】Pharmacotherapy may be considered in patients who do not reach their LDL goals with TLC alone. TLC should continue to be reinforced and encouraged even when starting medications . In someone who does not have CHD or a risk equivalent (primary prevention), medications should be considered after the third visit of TLC management. In someone with CHD or an equivalent (secondary prevention), the more stringent LDL goals often require earlier institution of drug treatment.\n\n【49】The first-line pharmacotherapy for LDL cholesterol reduction is a statin. Statins not only reduce LDL cholesterol but also reduce the rates of coronary events, strokes, cardiac death, and all-cause mortality. When statin therapy is started, fasting lipids should be rechecked in 6 weeks. If LDL goals are not met, the dose of the statin can be increased or a second agent added. These other medications include fibric acids, nicotinic acids, bile acid sequestrants, and cholesterol absorption blockers . When taking statins, liver enzymes must be monitored as well (6-12 weeks after initiation or dosage change, then every 6-12 months). When goal levels are met, regular follow-up should be arranged to reinforce lifestyle changes, medication compliance, and overall risk factor reduction.\n删除4：<u>Table 35–3 • MEDICATIONS USED TO LOWER CHOLESTEROL</u>\n\n【50】###", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

If so, for what specifically?\n\n【6】### ANSWERS TO CASE 18:\n\n【7】#### Disclosure and Apology\n\n【8】Summary : A 45-year-old woman is scheduled to see you for an annual routine visit. You noted a radiology report from chest radiography performed 10 months ago at the ED. The study suggested a retrosternal mass, and a follow-up examination was recommended. You do not remember ever having seen this report.\n\n【9】 Amount of detail to disclose to the patient : Disclose only what is known to you; do not speculate.\n\n【10】 Should you postpone having this conversation until you have spoken to the ED physician? Do not delay speaking with the patient, despite the fact that you do not have all of the answers. Disclose the information that you have and reassure the patient that you will keep her informed as you gather more information.\n\n【11】 Do you need to first speak with an oncologist? No, not if there is not time to do so prior to seeing the patient. Provide the patient with the information that you do know. You can speak with the patient again after speaking with the oncologist or after referring the patient for follow-up with an oncologist.\n\n【12】 Is an apology appropriate at this time? If so, for what specifically? An expression of empathy is always appropriate and this often uses the language of apology (eg, “I am so sorry that you have to go through this”). In this case, you do know there was a delay in seeing the report, so there should be an apology for that, for example, “I am sorry that I did not see this report until now. I will make sure we get you in to see the appropriate specialist right away.”\n\n【13】### ANALYSIS\n\n【14】##### Objectives\n\n【15】1\\. Identify the principles of transparent and compassionate disclosure.\n\n【16】2\\. Understand that disclosure is a process, not a single conversation.\n\n【17】3\\. Recognize the emotional challenges faced by clinicians following an adverse event so that these do not prevent transparent and compassionate interactions with the patient and family.\n\n【18】##### Considerations\n\n【19】In the case described, a woman is noted to have a retrosternal mass on chest radiography and a follow-up visit recommended. The patient is scheduled for a routine physical examination. In general, always share with the patient the known facts as soon as possible and do not speculate. Do not delay the discussion until you have the answers.\n\n【20】The patient will undoubtedly have many important questions that you will be unable to answer at this time. Acknowledge the importance of these questions and reassure her that you will arrange for her to see an oncologist who will guide her through the next steps. You should not speculate as to why this happened, but do make clear that you will look into why the report did not come to your attention. Be sure to express empathy (eg, “I am so sorry you have to go through this uncertainty”). Acknowledge how difficult it must be to hear this and invite her to express concerns and ask questions. Close by reviewing precise next steps (eg, “I am going to set up an appointment for you with one of my colleagues for sometime this week”). Lastly, be sure to remind her that you will be there for her.\n\n【21】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【22】#### Disclosure and Apology\n\n【23】### DEFINITIONS\n\n【24】ADVERSE EVENT : An undesired harmful effect that is not due to the patient’s underlying disease process; it may or may not be related to an error.\n\n【25】APOLOGY : A specific acknowledgment and expression of regret for having done something wrong or contributed to an error.\n\n【26】DISCLOSURE : A transparent process in which the known facts of a case are discussed with a patient, family members, or both.\n\n【27】### CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【28】We have a professional ethical obligation to inform our patients regarding their care. This is especially important when there has been an error. However, several research studies have shown that clinicians are not skilled in having discussions with patients and families after medical errors. It seems reasonable to assume that some of the barriers to meeting patient needs after errors might include the clinician’s sense of vulnerability and emotional distress.\n\n【29】Grappling with a medical error that caused harm to a patient is one of the most challenging moments of any clinician’s career. Many studies have documented the negative emotional impact on clinicians who have made errors. In addition to the sadness at seeing a patient experience suffering, there are professional, personal, and societal expectations of perfection that, although we may know intellectually are unrealistic, we feel deeply on an emotional level. Making an error shatters any illusions of perfection and can result in clinicians feeling ashamed, incompetent, guilty, and sad. The feelings of shame may be particularly strong because of a culture that expects perfection. These emotions may be accompanied by fear of loss of the patient’s trust, damaged reputation amongst colleagues, and possible litigation.\n\n【30】The event often involves a series of errors or perhaps someone else’s error. Clinicians may be in a position, then, of having to disclose and apologize for a colleague’s error. In addition, most clinicians do not have a great deal of experience in this arena, because the incidence of an individual clinician making a clinically significant error is not likely to be high, even over many years of practice. Therefore, it is important for all clinicians to understand some basic principles underlying effective disclosure conversations:\n\n【31】 The most important principle is to do what is best for the patient and family. The question is not “What would I want my physician to do or say in this instance?” Rather, it is trying to understand the needs of the patient and family in the moment and as they evolve.\n\n【32】 The attending physician taking care of the patient when the error is discovered should lead the conversation. If another attending made the error, that physician should ideally be the one to apologize and disclose, but this may be impractical in the immediate aftermath. When appropriate, other team members such as a nurse, social worker or trainee, could be present if this would be helpful to the patient and family.\n\n【33】 Always share with the patient the known facts as soon as possible. It is inadvisable to wait until there has been a root cause analysis or any process that will flesh out all the details.\n\n【34】 Do not speculate. If you know what happened but not why, then all you can share is what you do know. Speculation can inadvertently implicate others or mislead the patient. Because disclosure is a process, not an event, you should explain that you will continue to keep the patient informed if and when more information becomes available.\n\n【35】 Express empathy. One of the most direct ways to do so is to say, “I am sorry this happened. It is not what you or we expected.”\n\n【36】 If there has clearly been an error, then apologize. For example, you might say, “I am so sorry we gave you the wrong dose of medication.”\n\n【37】 Directly outline the next steps regarding the patient’s clinical care, and then pause and solicit the patient’s questions or concerns.\n\n【38】 If appropriate, explain that you or your institution is looking into why the event occurred and that you will get back to the patient when you have further information. If there has been an error, then it is important to say that you and your institution are committed to learning from this and working to improve processes to prevent a similar event from happening again.\n\n【39】 Be aware of your emotions so that they do not interfere with your ability to be transparent and compassionate.\n\n【40】Because this process can be emotionally challenging for physicians, it is important for health care institutions to provide both disclosure coaching as well as clinician peer support. Disclosure coaching is needed because few clinicians have vast experience in disclosing errors, and sometimes the circumstances of the adverse event are complicated enough that it is difficult to know what to say and how to say it. In addition, because of the emotions noted above, peer support is essential in helping the clinician be fully present for the patient and his or her family as well as to learn and grow from the experience.\n\n【41】### ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION\n\n【42】Applying these principles to the case above, the following would be a reasonable approach to consider. If the patient has a scheduled appointment the same day you first notice the radiology report, then you would need to tell her about this at that appointment. Delaying the discussion until you have the answers to these questions would likely generate a sense of mistrust. The patient is likely to have several important questions that you will not be able to answer, such as:\n\n【43】 What exactly could this mass be?\n\n【44】 What is going to happen to her?\n\n【45】 If this turns out to be cancer, then will the delay in following-up on the radiograph have harmed her?\n\n【46】All you can say is that these questions are important and that you do not have the answers right now. You are going to arrange for her to see a specialist who will guide her through the process, and you will make sure she gets the best advice and treatment.\n\n【47】Because you know there was an error in not having followed up on the abnormal results on the radiographs, you need to apologize for this. You should not speculate as to why this happened. However, you can say that you are going to look into why the report did not come to your attention.\n\n【48】After pausing and waiting for her to absorb the information, acknowledge how difficult it must be to hear this. Ask how she is feeling and invite her to express any concerns and to ask any questions.\n\n【49】Close by discussing the next steps that you will take, for example, “I am going to set up an appointment with one of my colleagues for sometime this week.” Express empathy by saying, “I am so sorry you have to go through this uncertainty.” Ask whether she or her family has any other questions right now and remind her that you will be there for her.\n\n【50】Every disclosure situation is unique and challenging. There is no perfect way to have these difficult conversations, but an understanding of some basic principles can be helpful. In addition, it is important that clinicians understand their own emotions so they can manage them and focus on the needs of the patient. Institutional programs that provide disclosure coaching and peer support are invaluable in helping physicians be honest and empathic with their patients.\n\n【51】###", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Daytime sleepiness and patterns of snoring should be explored. If either is present， he should be referred for a sleep study. With this patient's strong family history of early CHD， immediate treatment of his hypertension is indicated. Close monitoring of his altered cholesterol panel values is also indi-cated. If he is able to improve his exercise and diet and reduces weight subsequent to these changes， cholesterol levels may improve. Since he had nonspecific T wave changes， a repeat ECG in 6 months would be important.

Recent work 删除10：<u>(Feldman et al.， 2009)</u> suggests that a combination low-dose regimen is more effective than monotherapy. Potential combinations of diuretic with ACE inhibitors or combination diuretic with aldosterone receptor blocking drugs(ARB) are more effective and cause fewer side effects. Begin with lower dosages with increases of baseline dosages if BP targets less than 140/90 or less than 130/80 for diabetic patients are not reached.\n\n【43】●URGENT—stop smoking. Prescribe nicotine substitute patch and discuss plans for smoking cessation.\n\n【44】● Recommend low-fat， low-salt diet (DASH) high in fruits and vegetables； provide a referral to a dietitian and explain that lowering salt and eating fruits， vegetables and low-fat dairy products was found to be particularly effective in reducing blood pressure in minority patients 删除10：<u>(Moore et al.， 1999)</u>\n\n【45】Encourage walking a minimum of 3-5 days per week.

He has a recent history of parvovirus, diagnosed by his primary care provider (PCP) 5 days prior to presentation. He has been acting tired and looking pale, so his mother brought him to urgent care. A complete blood count (CBC) was drawn and demonstrated a hemoglobin of 6.5 g/dL and hematocrit of 18%. Previous iron deficiency anemia screenings at 12 and 19 months by his PCP had been normal. The child eats a regular diet and normal amount of milk for his age. He was admitted to an acute care unit for slow blood transfusion for symptomatic relief of anemia. Following transfusion therapy, intravenous immunoglobulin administration was planned to treat red cell aplasia caused by parvovirus.Past Medical History\n--------------------\n\n【5】No significant past medical or surgical history. Normal term delivery with no pregnancy complications. He was discharged from the hospital on day of life 2 with mother. No medication or food allergies. The child is taking vitamin D and children’s multivitamin.Family History\n--------------\n\n【6】No significant history. No history of anemia, no blood disorders or clotting disorders.Social History\n--------------\n\n【7】He lives at home with mother, father, and 5‐year‐old sister. No pets. No daycare.Current Status\n--------------\n\n【8】The child is admitted to the acute care service and you are the provider covering his management. You receive a call from the acute care nurse who reports that the child is itching his arms and squirming around in the bed. You meet the child, his mother, and the nurse at the bedside and they report the itching began approximately 5 minutes ago. The red blood cell transfusion has been infusing for 45 minutes. The child had no prior rashes, skin infections, or history of eczema.\n\n【9】The vital signs at the time of your assessment (45 minutes into transfusion) are temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F), heart rate 102 bpm, respiratory rate 34 breaths per minute, blood pressure 96/52 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 100% on room air.\n\n【10】The vital signs at the start of packed red blood cell infusion were temperature 36.5°C (97.7°F), heart rate 98 bpm, respiratory rate 32 breaths per minute, blood pressure 92/50 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 100% on room air.\n\n【11】An urgent complete blood count is ordered with the results shown in Table 74.1 .Questions\n---------\n\n【12】Answer the following questions using the details provided.\n\n【13】1.  Based on the data given, what are the differential diagnoses and the most likely diagnosis for the acute change in this child?\n2.  What is your immediate response for this patient?

He is interactive with his mother, has no change in voice quality, and denies pain or stomach ache. His face is symmetric and pale. His oropharynx is pink without exudate or edema with tonsils 1+ bilaterally, tongue protruded midline. His breath sounds are clear bilaterally with no cough, wheeze, crackles, or increased work of breathing. He has a normal cardiac rate and rhythm at apex, with warm and well‐perfused extremities with 2‐second capillary refill. His abdomen is protuberant, soft, non‐tender, with normoactive bowel sounds. He has three urticarial lesions on his neck and scratches on his arms from itching. No other skin changes on lower extremities or trunk are noted.\n\n【17】1.  Based on the additional information, what differential diagnoses will you continue to consider?\n2.  What pharmacologic interventions may be necessary for this patient?\n3.  Would you resume the blood transfusion?Rationale and Evidence‐based Practice Explanation\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】### Based on the data given, what are the differential diagnoses and the most likely diagnosis for the acute change in this child?\n\n【19】The onset of the child’s symptoms suggest that he is experiencing a reaction to the blood transfusion. Blood transfusion reactions are divided into immediate immunologic complications and non‐immunologic complications. Immediate immunologic complications include hemolytic transfusion reaction, febrile non‐hemolytic reaction, allergic reaction, anaphylactoid/anaphylactic reaction, and transfusion‐related acute lung injury. Non‐immunologic complications include transmission of infection including cytomegalovirus and bacterial sepsis, transfusion‐associated circulatory overload, hypothermia, and other metabolic derangements. The most common type of transfusion reaction during red blood cell or platelet transfusion is an allergic reaction. There are additional, less-common potential transfusion reactions that should be considered when caring for a patient receiving a blood product. In order of prevalence they are: febrile non‐hemolytic reaction, circulatory volume overload, acute hemolysis, hypotensive reaction, bacterial contamination, sepsis, acute lung injury, and air embolism.\n\n【20】### What is your immediate response for this patient? Describe your assessment of each body system\n\n【21】It is essential to verify that the blood transfusion has been stopped and 0.9% saline is infusing intravenously. The patient should immediately be assessed for evidence of airway, breathing, or circulatory compromise. As you evaluate the patient, it is important to obtain any history of previous allergic reactions or exposures, any complaints of pain, unusual sensation in the throat, change in voice, or gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea and stomach ache. Vital signs should be obtained.\n\n【22】Your evaluation by system should include the following.\n\n【23】   General: mental status, ability to respond to questions, anxiety, perception of impending doom.\n   Head, eyes, ear, nose and throat: facial color, nasal congestion, patency of the throat, mucosal edema.\n   Cardiovascular: chest pain, central and peripheral perfusion.\n   Lungs: breath sounds, work of breathing.\n   Integument: presence of urticarial or other rash, skin color.\n\n【24】It is necessary to verify the label on the blood transfusion bag and also notify the blood bank of a suspected transfusion reaction. Additional laboratory studies may be required as directed by the blood bank.\n\n【25】### Based on the additional information, what differential diagnoses will you continue to consider?\n\n【26】The child is not having respiratory symptoms, such as tachypnea, hypoxemia, bronchospasm, or dyspnea, so acute lung injury and circulatory volume overload are less likely at this time. The most common signs/symptoms of a transfusion reaction are fever, chills, pruritis, and urticaria. Any increase in temperature with chills, rigors, hypotension, nausea or vomiting should lead you to consider a hemolytic reaction or reaction due to bacterial contamination. Since he has not had an increase in temperature of 1°C or more and did not have a temperature above 38.0°C, febrile transfusion reaction and possible sepsis could be excluded from the differential diagnosis. However, new signs could still arise and transfusion reactions can develop up to 24 hours following the transfusion. One should always be aware of the potential for a more severe reaction to develop and for the signs which indicate a severe transfusion reaction. Other findings of more severe transfusion reactions include chills, rigors, nausea, vomiting, hypotension, respiratory distress, hemoglobinuria, loss of consciousness, back pain, jaundice, abnormal bleeding, and oliguria. This child was experiencing an allergic blood transfusion that was limited to urticaria, though he required ongoing evaluation for more extensive signs and symptoms. The CBC obtained during the transfusion demonstrated a slight rise in the hemoglobin and hematocrit, appropriate for the volume of red cells that had been administered at the time the sample was drawn.\n\n【27】### What pharmacologic interventions may be necessary for this patient?\n\n【28】An H <sub>1 </sub> antihistamine is recommended to treat the symptom of hives and itching. The pediatric dosing recommendation is 1–2 mg/kg. If the reaction progressed and was consistent with anaphylaxis, additional intervention would be required according to Pediatric Advanced Life Support. Signs of anaphylaxis include bronchospasm, respiratory distress, hypotension, and gastrointestinal upset. The first‐line intervention for anaphylaxis is intramuscular epinephrine (1:1000) at a dose of 0.01 mg/kg, with a maximum dose 0.3 mg. In addition to the H <sub>1 </sub> antihistamine, an H <sub>2 </sub> antihistamine such as ranitidine may also be prescribed for cutaneous manifestations. Corticosteroids may also be indicated. A normal saline bolus of 20 mL/kg may be administered for hemodynamic instability. In the setting of wheezing, albuterol, a β <sub>2 </sub> ‐adrenergic receptor agonist bronchodilator, may also be administered via inhaler or nebulizer.\n\n【29】### Would you resume the blood transfusion?\n\n【30】If the patient’s only symptom of blood product transfusion reaction was urticaria that resolved after diphenhydramine administration, the transfusion with the same unit can be restarted at a slower rate with close observation. If additional signs of allergic reaction or new signs of fever or other type of reaction occur, the unit should be returned to the blood bank accompanied by appropriate transfusion reaction laboratory sampling.Case Resolution\n---------------\n\n【31】This child tolerated resumption of the packed cell transfusion at a slower rate. The urticarial rash resolved and the follow‐up CBC demonstrated an appropriate rise in hemoglobin and hematocrit.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Her mother reports a tactile fever and states her daughter has not been eating or drinking very well. The child has been treated with acetaminophen every 6 hours as needed for her tactile fever and Maalox for her abdominal pain. The child has not had emesis or diarrhea and last voided 10 hours ago.

What is appropriate care in the immediate postoperative period for a child who has undergone a laparoscopic appendectomy?\n2.  What would be the plan for hospital discharge and follow‐up?Rationale and Evidence‐based Practice Explanation\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【23】### Based on the data given, what are the differential diagnoses that should be considered and the most likely diagnosis for this teen?\n\n【24】Differential diagnoses to consider for this child include a urinary tract infection, ovarian torsion, ovarian cyst, gastroenteritis, and appendicitis. Based on this child’s elevated white blood cell count with a left shift and her ultrasound findings, she most likely has appendicitis. Appendicitis is the most common emergent indication for abdominal surgery in children. The peak incidence of diagnosis is 10–19 years of age 删除10：<u>(Wagner et al . 2018 )</u>. Although nearly half of the children diagnosed with appendicitis will have an atypical presentation, this patient had many of the classic symptoms including dull periumbilical pain migrating to the right lower quadrant, fever, and anorexia.\n\n【25】### What is the most appropriate testing for this diagnosis?\n\n【26】There are several appendicitis scores (e.g. Alvarado, Appendicitis Inflammatory Response Score, Pediatric Appendicitis Score) that can aid clinicians when making the diagnosis. Depending on the score, a white blood cell count of greater than 10 000–15 000/mm <sup>3 </sup> with a neutrophil count above 75% are laboratory findings that contribute to the likelihood of appendicitis, along with clinical findings of right lower quadrant pain, anorexia, and guarding 删除10：<u>(Wagner et al . 2018 )</u>. Radiologic evaluation includes the use of ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). CT scan is known to be the most sensitive but does expose children to ionizing radiation. Ultrasound is the most commonly performed radiologic test and can be done in the awake toddler and child without exposure to ionizing radiation. Ultrasound has high specificity but low sensitivity because operator experience is variable 删除10：<u>(Mittal et al . 2013 )</u>. The findings of acute appendicitis include an inflamed fluid‐filled appendix, a non‐compressible blind‐ending structure measuring greater than 6 mm in maximal diameter; an appendicolith may or may not be present. Negative ultrasound findings include the organ not visualized with no secondary findings suggestive of appendicitis. MRI is gaining popularity as it does not employ ionizing radiation and contrast is not needed. Most centers can perform the test without sedation in children older than 5 years 删除10：<u>(Mittal et al . 2013 )</u>. Findings suggestive of appendicitis on MRI include an appendiceal diameter greater than 7 mm, periappendiceal fat infiltration, and restricted diffusion of the appendiceal wall 删除10：<u>(Mittal et al . 2013 )</u>. Availability of this modality and high cost are factors that are making use of this terchnique variable.\n\n【27】### What are appropriate interventions for the treatment of simple acute appendicitis?\n\n【28】Treatment approaches for appendicitis most often include operative management with preoperative intravenous antibiotics, intravenous fluids, and intravenous pain management. Laparoscopic appendectomy is the most common operative intervention, with these procedures converted to open operations as indicated. Non‐operative intervention has been recently studied and is an option in some cases of appendicitis 删除10：<u>(Gonzalez et al . 2016 )</u>. Candidates for non‐operative intervention are summarized in Table 92.4 . Non‐operative candidates in a hospitalized setting are administered antibiotics and diet is progressed based on clinical examination findings. A success rate for non‐operative management is cited as 70–85% for children at 1 year 删除10：<u>(Gonzalez et al . 2016 )</u>.\n\n【29】Table 92.4 Candidate inclusion criteria for non‐operative management of acute appendicitis.\n\n| 7–17 years old |\n| --- |\n| Abdominal pain less than 48 hours with no history of chronic abdominal pain |\n| White blood cell count 5000–18 000/mm 3 |\n| Ultrasound imaging: hyperemia, <1.1 cm in diameter, compressible or non‐compressible, no abscess, no fecalith/appendicolith, no phlegmon |\n| No preoperative concern for perforation |\n| No diffuse peritonitis |\n| Not pregnant |\n| No malignancy |\n| Not currently taking antibiotics |\n\n【31】### What is appropriate care in the immediate postoperative period for a child who has undergone a laparoscopic appendectomy?\n\n【32】Care in the immediate postoperative period includes intravenous and oral pain medications, diet progression as tolerated, and early ambulation with no additional antibiotics 删除10：<u>(Hornor et al . 2018 )</u>. Ambulation and preparation for discharge are also included in the postoperative plans.\n\n【33】### What would be the plan for hospital discharge and follow‐up?\n\n【34】Same‐day discharge is the evolving benchmark for children undergoing appendectomy for simple acute appendicitis 删除10：<u>(Benedict et al . 2018 )</u>.

Requiring consent for all procedures protects a patient’s dignity and bodily  删除换行1 integrity and respects the patient’s values.\n\n【11】Consent does not have to be given in writing; it can be given verbally or even implied from  删除换行1 the circumstances, e.g. holding an arm out for an injection, nodding the head, although  删除换行1 care must be taken to ensure the patient has understood what is going to be done and why.\nWhere the investigation or treatment is complex, if it involves significant risks or where there  删除换行1 may be significant consequences for the patient’s employment, social or personal life, written  删除换行1 consent should be obtained 删除10：<u>(GMC Consent: patients and doctors making decisions together,  删除换行1 2008)</u>. Written consent is also needed for any surgical procedure even if there is minimal  删除换行1 risk associated with it. GMC guidance also states that ‘if, after discussion, a patient still does  删除换行1 not want to know in detail about their condition or the treatment, you should respect their  删除换行1 wishes, as far as possible. But you must still give them the information they need in order to  删除换行1 give their consent to a proposed investigation or treatment’ (including information about  删除换行1 level of pain and discomfort and serious risks).\n\n【12】In the present scenario it might be tempting to ‘just get the form signed’ and it is important to  删除换行1 document when consent has been given. However, although a signed consent form is prima  删除换行1 facie evidence of consent, the form itself does not mean valid consent has been given, for  删除换行1 example, the patient may later claim that his consent was not voluntary.\n\n【13】There is also the question of who should obtain consent. Most agree that it is good practice for the healthcare professional performing the procedure to obtain consent as it is their  删除换行1 responsibility, but in practice this does not always happen. The process of taking consent  删除换行1 can be delegated, but the person seeking consent must be suitably trained and qualified,  删除换行1 have sufficient knowledge of the proposed investigation or treatment and understand and be  删除换行1 able to explain the risks involved.\n删除26：<u>!</u> Essential elements of consent\n\n【14】• The patient must be competent to give consent.\n\n【15】• It must be voluntary and not coerced.\n\n【16】• The patient must be provided with information about the procedure.\n\n【17】Competence is presumed in patients aged 16 and over unless there is evidence to the contrary.\nIf an adult patient lacks capacity to consent, treatment can be given in their best interests.\n\n【18】Relatives do not have the authority to make that decision on a patient’s behalf unless there  删除换行1 is a Lasting Power of Attorney in place. Arguably a certain amount of coercion occurs in  删除换行1 almost all cases, but consent is only considered not voluntary where there is undue, excessive  删除换行1 or unwarranted exercise of power or trust (Case 28).\n\n【19】To make a valid choice a person must be given information of the broad nature and purpose  删除换行1 of the proposed treatment at the very least – what the procedure involves and why it is needed  删除换行1 as well as the likely outcomes. Failure to provide this basic information could give rise to  删除换行1 a claim of battery. But this may not be enough to prevent an action for negligence if harm  删除换行1 occurs which could have been avoided if the patient had been provided with sufficient information about risks and alternative treatments (Case 42). How much information the patient  删除换行1 needs is difficult to judge because particular risks may have significance to certain patients.\nDoctors have a powerful role as dispensers of information as well as medicines and treatment.\n\n【20】Consent is limited to the procedures which the patient has been informed of and agreed  删除换行1 to. Except in an emergency it cannot be exceeded to include other procedures. A surgical  删除换行1 consent form will include a term that additional procedures, not included in the scope of the  删除换行1 original consent, may be performed if it would be unreasonable to delay the procedure and  删除换行1 it is in the patient’s best interests. However, it must be immediately necessary and not merely  删除换行1 convenient to proceed without explicit consent.\n\n【21】Ethical issues\n\n【22】A patient’s right to decide whether to accept or reject treatment, the right of self-determination,  删除换行1 is the cornerstone of patient-centred care. Respect for autonomy entails that patient choice  删除换行1 is respected even if the decision is not one that most patients in that position would make.\nCan patients be truly autonomous? There is an imbalance of power between the informed  删除换行1 and experienced doctor and the vulnerable patient, whose autonomy may be compromised  删除换行1 by illness. Although full autonomy may be difficult to achieve, a patient can be sufficiently  删除换行1 autonomous. The nature of information given to a patient and the way in which it is presented  删除换行1 can affect the patient’s choice, and ultimately whether or not they consent to the procedure  删除换行1 proposed. In this scenario the patient is exercising his autonomy in saying that he ‘does not  删除换行1 want to know’. From a legal perspective this is problematic because consent must be based on  删除换行1 an informed decision.\n\n【23】Medical students\n\n【24】Patients should be informed that medical students would like to sit in on a consultation and  删除换行1 this should be done prior to the arrival of student observers. Patients should feel able to refuse  删除换行1 consent to the presence of students during their consultation and/or examination and they  删除换行1 should be reassured that their decision will not affect their treatment (BMA Consent Tool  删除换行3 Kit, 5th edition).\n\n【25】Key Points\n\n【26】• The patient must be competent to give consent.\n\n【27】• Consent must be voluntary and not coerced.\n\n【28】• The patient must be provided with information about the procedure.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Her medical history is notable for end-stage renal disease, and she is on hemodialysis three times per week. The rash began on her left calf as a small dark purple area but has continued to spread and become more painful. On examination, there is a purpuric plaque with surrounding erythema and irregular, stellate borders, which is firm and exquisitely tender to gentle palpation 通用删除7(英):<u>( 22 )</u>.\n\n【4】i. What is the most likely diagnosis? What are risk factors for this condition?\n\n【5】ii. What are the characteristic findings on histology?\n\n【6】iii. What are the available treatment options?\n\n【7】Answer 22\n\n【8】i. Calciphylaxis (also known as calcific uremic arteriolopathy), is a phenomenon that occurs in patients with end-stage renal disease and/or hyperparathyroidism, and is characterized by vascular calcification and thrombosis, leading to cutaneous necrosis. It is thought to be caused by elevated levels of serum calcium, phosphate and parathyroid hormone (PTH), often seen in the setting of chronic renal failure. Because of dysfunctional calcium homeostasis, calcium phosphate precipitates in the media of arterioles, leading to vessel injury, intimal fibrosis, thrombosis and cutaneous and soft tissue necrosis. Clinically, calciphylaxis initially presents as an area of fixed livedo reticularis that is firm to the touch and then progresses to become more violaceous, purpuric, bullous and ultimately necrotic. The most common areas of involvement are the legs below the knees (up to 90% of patients), followed by the thighs, buttocks and abdomen.\n\n【9】Up to 4% of patients on hemodialysis and 4% of patients on peritoneal dialysis develop calciphylaxis. Additional risk factors are diabetes mellitus, body mass index (BMI) >30, liver disease, hypoalbuminemia, protein C deficiency and exposure to warfarin or systemic corticosteroids.\n\n【10】ii. Calciphylaxis is a type of metastatic calcification (i.e. it represents calcification in normal tissue) and is associated with elevated serum calcium or phosphate or both. It is characterized by calcified small vessels in the subcutaneous fat with associated necrosis. As vascular calcification is a common finding in patients with end-stage renal disease, this finding alone is not sufficient to confirm the diagnosis of calciphylaxis. Special care must be taken when obtaining a skin biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and excisional biopsies may be required to obtain a specimen that is large and deep enough to demonstrate the diagnostic features.\n\n【11】iii. Calciphylaxis is associated with a mortality rate of 50% at 1 year and 80% at 2 years and is estimated to be even higher in patients with both proximal and distal disease. The most common cause of death is septicemia due to chronic open wounds that are resistant to healing. The treatment of calciphylaxis usually consists of multiple approaches, all targeted towards calcium metabolism. Phosphate binders, low-calcium dialysate and intravenous sodium thiosulfate have been used with varying levels of success. In addition, surgical debridement and hyperbaric oxygen therapy may be helpful for ulcer healing. Parathyroidectomy can be considered in patients with marked elevation of PTH.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

He recovered well from the stroke but is left with a weakness on his left side and an inability to swallow. The couple has managed well with artificial  删除换行1 nutrition via a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) line.\n\n【4】The general practitioner checks his records. The patient has long-standing essential hypertension, type 2 diabetes and a history of stroke. His medical conditions seem well-controlled and  删除换行1 the patient attends his regular health checks and has annual flu vaccinations. He suffers from  删除换行1 intermittent urine and chest infections that usually resolve quickly with antibiotic treatment.\n\n【5】The patient gets angry, ‘My daughter has been trying to control me for a long time and now  删除换行1 she has managed to cut me off from my finances’. The wife explains that the daughter had  删除换行1 been to her father’s bank and the bank manager had raised concerns about multiple saving  删除换行1 accounts and credit cards and loss of earned interest. She got her sister to agree to cancel all  删除换行1 the father’s credit cards and move his savings into one account with a better interest rate.\n‘I can’t even buy the paint for the airplane models I work on without asking now’, he complains. He challenged his daughter and demanded access to his money, but she smiled at him  删除换行1 and said ‘I am looking after your best interests now daddy, and there is nothing you can do  删除换行1 about it’.\n\n【6】The patient had visited a solicitor in town who had told him that the problem could be  删除换行1 resolved either the soft or the hard way. Being very upset, the patient agreed to follow the  删除换行1 hard way. The solicitor told him that the first step was to visit the GP so that he or she can  删除换行1 confirm his mental capacity.\n\n【7】Questions\n\n【8】• How would you assess the patient’s mental capacity to manage his property and  删除换行1 financial affairs?\n\n【9】• Do you think his daughters had the right to cancel his credit cards and rationalize  删除换行1 his saving accounts?\n\n【10】• What does the solicitor mean by resolving the problem the soft or the hard way?\n\n【11】• Do you think the solicitor has acted professionally and with a good understanding  删除换行1 of the National Health Service by asking the patient to make a routine appointment  删除换行1 to have his capacity assessed?\n\n【12】ANSWER 16\n\n【13】The Mental Capacity Act gives clear guidance on how to do an assessment. To have capacity  删除换行1 to make a decision, someone must be able to\n\n【14】• Understand the information relevant to the decision\n\n【15】• Retain the information\n\n【16】• Use that information as part of the process of making the decision\n\n【17】• Communicate his/her decision either by talking, signing or any other means\n\n【18】The patient is clearly able to understand what has happened to his bank accounts and credit  删除换行1 cards and able to retain the information and communicate his decision to regain control.\nThere is little doubt that he has capacity to manage his financial affairs. The patient has given  删除换行1 property and financial affairs joint LPA to his daughters. This LPA gives an attorney the  删除换行1 power to make decisions about money and property for a person, for example managing a  删除换行1 bank or building society account, paying bills, collecting benefits or a pension and selling  删除换行1 your home. This power can be used as soon as the LPA is registered but only with the patient’s  删除换行1 permission. In the argument with her father, the daughter stated that she had the power to  删除换行1 make decisions in his best interest. The Mental Capacity Act is clear that all decisions made  删除换行1 in the best interest of a person must\n\n【19】• Involve the person who lacks capacity\n\n【20】• Be aware of the person’s wishes and feelings\n\n【21】• Consult with others who are involved in the care of the person\n\n【22】• Not be made on assumptions based solely on the person’s age, appearance, condition  删除换行1 or behaviour\n\n【23】• Consider whether the person is likely to regain capacity to make the decision in the  删除换行1 future\n\n【24】As the patient seems very upset about his lack of access to his finances, one can assume he did  删除换行1 not give consent to his daughters’ actions. Abuse of LPA can be seen as a criminal act and the  删除换行1 daughters might have made themselves vulnerable to prosecution.\n\n【25】The solicitor spoke of a soft and a hard way to resolve this conflict. As he failed to write a  删除换行1 letter detailing his plans on how he intends to proceed, the GP has to make assumptions.The soft way could have meant sitting down with all family members and discussing what  删除换行1 powers are given under LPA and that the patient has a right to be involved. The fallout  删除换行1 between family members might have made the prospect of meeting the whole family unappealing and so the hard way was chosen. The patient can end or change his LPA even if it’s  删除换行1 been registered, as long as he has mental capacity (hence the need of a GP note). All he  删除换行1 needs to do is to make a written statement called a ‘deed of revocation’ and send it to the  删除换行5 Office of the Public Guardian. As an alternative, he can complain about how his attorney is  删除换行1 not carrying out his responsibilities properly. It is arguable whether the hard way to resolve  删除换行1 is wise as it could leave a person with good advance care planning in place vulnerable if the \n\n【26】LPA has been revoked.\nCase 16: Capacity\n\n【27】The solicitor has behaved inappropriately by asking the patient to make a routine appointment with his GP to have his capacity to manage his financial affairs endorsed. This work  删除换行1 is not part of essential services for GPs and the British Medical Association’s (BMA)\nProfessional Fees Committee advises doctors to undertake this work only if they have  删除换行1 agreed the level and payment arrangements for the work in advance. The solicitor should  删除换行1 have written a letter to the GP asking for an assessment to be undertaken and offered a fee  删除换行1 for this service.\n\n【28】• Patients present at times with issues that are not directly health related and may  删除换行1 involve family conflict. It is important to take a step back and see families as a unit.\n\n【29】• Doctors are becoming increasingly involved with advanced care planning and  删除换行1 need to keep themselves well informed about the Mental Capacity Act of 2005  删除换行1 and the legislation around lasting power of attorney.\n\n【30】• Be careful when your patient is sent to you by a solicitor.\n删除12：<u>Key Points35\n\n【31】删除29：<u>Case 17: Cervical Smear Request</u>\n\n【32】</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "db207b4d-479a-405d-8522-33cf9d9dc1ea", "title": null, "text": "【0】### Session 2\n\n【1】Beginning with session 2, each subsequent session began with a review of the preceding week, including any significant changes in David’s tics. David and the therapist then updated the tic hierarchy (assigning new SUDS ratings to each tic). David identified his head-jerking tic as particularly bothersome over the past week, indicating that it caused tension and discomfort in his neck and shoulders. Thus, he provided a SUDS rating of 9—a 2-point increase from the initial session. When asked about the increase, David noted that his tic seemed to be slightly worse, which he attributed to “paying so much attention to it.” His mother, however, noted that she believed the tic actually seemed to be less frequent overall. The therapist then reviewed the self-monitoring homework (which was completed as requested) and two things were apparent. First, based on parent observations, David’s tic did seem to show a slight decrease during self-monitoring periods over the course of the week. On the first day of self-monitoring, David’s mother had observed 45 tics in a 10-min period. The number of tics observed by his mother decreased slightly across all observations, and by the sixth observation his mother noted 26 tics during a 10-min period. Second, it was apparent that David was having a difficult time noticing his tics. During the first self-monitoring period, David noted only 22 tics (compared to his mother’s 45), and all subsequent observations were similarly discrepant. When asked about the discrepancy, David insisted that his mother was seeing “things that were not there.” We reassured David that parents and children often do notice different things and that a part of treatment was to work together so that David could learn to recognize his tics and also help his parents learn what is and is not a tic.\n\n【2】We next reviewed the FBAI forms. David and his mother identified that his tic was particularly bad when doing homework after school. David’s mother noted that his tics also seemed to be worse when he was playing videogames, which he often played for an hour immediately after school, before starting homework. The FBAI forms also revealed that when he experienced tic exacerbations while doing homework, David’s mother allowed him to take a break from his homework until his tics reduced. During these breaks, David would often go to his room and play video games until his mother called him back to the table. David’s mother qualified this by stating that his tics seemed to exacerbate before he came to the table, so he had a difficult time getting started on his work. After reminding David and his mother about the rationale behind FBAI, we made the following FBAI recommendations to address homework: (a) when David came home after school, he was limited to 20 min of video game time after which he would practice his HRT exercises (which were taught later in the session), (b) he would then immediately begin doing his homework, (c) if he completed his homework within 1 h, he would earn an additional 30 min of video game time before dinner, and (d) if his tics exacerbated during homework, he would stop his homework, remain at the table, and spend 10 min practicing HRT exercises (this time did not count against his 1 h limit) before returning to his homework. The plan was written out, and David’s mother was asked to tape it to the homework table as a visual reminder. David’s reward program was then adjusted so that he would receive extra points toward his weekly reward if he followed through with this plan.\n\n【3】After developing the FBAI plan, habit reversal was conducted for the first tic on David’s hierarchy (his head-jerking tic). The first step in HRT is awareness training (AT). The rationale for AT is that if the child is to learn how to manage his tic, he must first become aware of each time it occurs (as opposed to a general awareness that the tic is present). AT has two primary components: response description and response detection. Response description involves developing a detailed description of the discrete, sequential movements involved in the tic, beginning with the first movement and ending with the offset of the tic, along with any pre-tic warning signs such as premonitory urges. To begin AT, we first gave David the opportunity to describe his head-jerking tic in detail. As children often do, David first described his tic in vague terms, stating, “my head jerks back.” Then, based on our observations, we used guided questions to help him recognize additional movements involved in the tic. The following dialogue between David (D) and the therapist (T) illustrates how David came to recognize that his head-jerking tic was more involved than he originally thought:\n\n【4】> T: Okay, so you say that your head jerks back. I can see that, and that’s a pretty good description. But let’s really pay attention and see if your tic involves more than just jerking your head back. Close your eyes and really focus on the muscles involved and which way your head moves from start to finish.\n> \n> D: Well, after it goes back, it sort of rolls to the side and then comes forward again.\n> \n> T: Right, I see that too, good job. I actually noticed something else though, right at the beginning of your tic. Pay close attention to how your tic starts.\n> \n> D: Yeah, I guess before it goes back, it actually comes forward first, my chin goes down toward my chest. I’ve never really noticed that before, but I guess it makes sense. In order for it to go back so hard, it has to come forward. Kind of like a wind-up. Like throwing a baseball.\n> \n> T: Good, you’re really getting the hang of this! You are right; your head comes forward first, not back. I noticed something else when you do that too. What’s going on with your shoulders?\n> \n> D (voluntarily performs the tic to check): When my chin is coming down, my shoulders sort of hunch forward. Then when my head goes back, I throw my shoulders back too.\n> \n> T: Great job, I see that too.\n> \n> D: I’ve never really noticed that before.\n> \n> T: You’ve had this tic for a few years and never really paid much attention to it. It turns out that the tic is a lot more complicated than you thought. It’s not just throwing your head back. It actually involves your head coming forward first and involves your shoulders too. I have another question for you. Do you notice any feelings in your body, maybe in your head, neck, or shoulders right before the tic happens?\n> \n> D: Yeah, right before I do it, I get an energy feeling in the back of my neck.\n> \n> T: And what happens to that feeling after you do the tic?\n> \n> D: It goes away, for a little bit, but then it comes right back.\n> \n> T: Okay, so it all starts and ends with that energy feeling. And that’s important. That energy feeling is the give-away that tells you the tic is coming. It’s like being able to read the sign that a catcher sends to a pitcher in baseball. It tells you what is coming. Now tell me all of those different parts of the tic in order, starting with the urge feeling, and then we’ll write that down.\n> \n> D: Sure, okay. So I get the energy feeling in the back of my neck, then I dip my chin down and my shoulders come forward, like the wind up, and then I throw my head straight back really hard, and my shoulders go back too. When my head is all the way back I roll it to the left and my shoulders come forward. When my head rolls all the way back to the front, it goes back to normal and the urge goes away.\n\n【5】As the reader will note from the preceding dialogue, children often initially describe their tics in general terms, missing important aspects of the tic sequence. One common mistake made by therapists during AT is taking the child’s definition of his tic at face value (e.g. head jerks back) and failing to gather an adequate description of each of the movements and sensations that comprise the target tic, which can have implications for subsequent steps in HRT (such as selecting a CR, see CRT below).\n\n【6】After generating a detailed definition of David’s head-jerking tic, the therapist initiated the second component of AT, response detection. The purpose of response detection is to teach the child to recognize each instance of his tic. We introduced this to David as the “Catch The Tic” game. To play the game, David and the therapist sat across from each other. David was instructed to raise his index finger each time he noticed that he ticced. The therapist would also raise his index finger if he noticed the tic first or if David missed a tic. Typically, response detection is practiced for 10–20 consecutive minutes or until the child is able to catch 80 % of his tics (some children require more, some less), while engaged in a discussion, and the child is simply rewarded with praise every time he catches a tic. However, given David’s ADHD status and to increase motivation, several modifications were made. First, the duration of the response detection periods were reduced to four, 5-min intervals with brief breaks in between. Second, the therapist and David sat relatively quietly while playing catch the tic, so to avoid distraction, although the therapist did offer praise when David caught a tic, promoted him when he missed a tic, and offered general encouragement and feedback. Third, it was decided that if David caught more tics than the therapist during three of the four 5-min periods, he would earn 10 min of access to a preferred activity at the end of the session.\n\n【7】In most cases, after 20 min of response detection, children will have reached an acceptable level of awareness and the second step of HRT, CRT, would begin. However, in David’s case, he was catching only 40–50 % of his tics by the end of the session. As such, the therapist taught David’s mother how to play the “Catch The Tic” game and asked them to practice for 20 min each day during the next week. In addition, the therapist asked David and his mother to continue self-monitoring his head-jerking tic and to continue to use the FBAI to monitor for tic-exacerbating factors.\n\n【8】### Session 3\n\n【9】When David and his mother returned for the third session, David and the therapist updated the tic hierarchy and assigned new SUDS ratings to each tic. David noted that his head-jerking tic was slightly less bothersome and provided a SUDS rating of 6 (a 3-point decrease from the previous session). The therapist then reviewed the self-monitoring homework and noted that agreement between David and his mother regarding the number of tics observed had improved. They then reviewed and problem solved the FBAI assignment from the previous session. David and his mother both agreed that he was getting much better at catching his tic, so David and the therapist played a brief 5-min game of “catch the tic,” during which David caught 85 % of his tics, and in many cases was catching the tic before it happened. When asked, David explained that he was able to detect the feeling in his neck, so he knew the tic was coming.\n\n【10】Given David’s success with AT, the therapist introduced CRT. The purpose of CRT was to teach David to engage in a tic-incompatible CR each time he felt the urge to tic, caught the tic mid-stream, and/or immediately after he performed a tic. David and the therapist worked together to come up with a CR according to five general rules. First, the CR should be something that makes the tic impossible or difficult to perform (i.e. it should be directly incompatible with performance of the tic). Second, the CR should interrupt the earliest sequence in the movement. Third, the CR should be something that is less noticeable than the tic itself. Fourth, the CR should (ideally) be a behavior that can be done anytime and anywhere. And finally, the CR should be something that the child can do for at least 1 min, or until the urge to tic subsides, whichever is longer. David was provided with some general examples and then was asked to brainstorm a CR for his neck-jerking tic.\n\n【11】Initially, David stated that he could hold the back of his neck with his hands; however, when the therapist reviewed the aforementioned rules, he quickly realized that was more noticeable than the tic and was not something he could do all of the time (e.g. when doing homework). David then suggested that he could hold his chin down toward his sternum. Although this initially sounded like a good option, the therapist noted that the first movement involved in his tic was to bring his chin down, which violated the “incompatible” rule and emphasizes the importance of generating a detailed and complete description of the tic during the response description phase of AT (as a reminder, David first described his tic as his head jerking back). Given that David was having difficulty selecting a CR, the therapist suggested that he try raising his chin slightly, tightening the muscles in the back of his neck (with minimal tension necessary), and pulling his shoulders down and back to avoid the “windup.” After David was able to successfully demonstrate this CR, the therapist and David practiced using the CR for 20 min. Similar to the “Catch The Tic” game used during AT, David earned points each time he was able to successfully implement the CR, and the therapist prompted him to use the CR each time he displayed a tic. In addition, the therapist asked David to give periodic urge ratings (on a 0–10 scale) while he was using the CR and the therapist plotted these on a graph for David to see. Initially, David was having difficulty catching some of his tics, and he required frequent prompts to use his CR. However, by the end of the session, David was catching most of his tics. In addition, David learned that although his urge ratings increased initially while using his CR (to ratings of 9–10), they declined fairly dramatically after 1–2 min and by the end of the session peak, ratings were lower (ratings of 5–6). David’s mother was then taught how to appropriately prompt and praise use of the CR (i.e. social support) while otherwise ignoring the tic.

She sought medical attention for it and underwent surgical excision， which is the best treatment for malignant melanoma (MM). These malignan-cies involve melanocytes and thus are usually pigmented. Features of the lesion that were suspicious are summarized by the acronym ABCD： asym-metry， borders (irregular being worrisome)， color (variation of color)， and diameter (greater than 6 mm). These features are presented in Figure 44-1. Other characteristics include itchiness or burning， appearance in adulthood，\n\n【12】删除3：<u>Figure 44-1.

Surgical excision is the best therapy， although adjuvant chemotherapy may play a role.</u></u>\nAPPROACH TO MALIGNANT MELANOMA\n\n【13】Objectives\n\n【14】Describe the ABCD criteria.\n\n【15】Know the most important prognostic factor for malignant melanoma.\n\n【16】● List the clinical presentation of other skin neoplasms.\n\n【17】Definitions\n\n【18】Melanocytic nevi： Generally considered a benign neoplastic proliferation of melanocytes that vary considerably in clinical and histologic appearance.\n\n【19】Dysplastic nevi (atypical nevi)： A clinical and histologic continuum between common nevi and superficial spreading melanoma. Dysplastic nevi are common， occurring in 2 to 18 percent of the population； how-ever， patients with dysplastic nevi and two family members with melanoma have a 50 percent lifetime risk of developing melanoma.\n\n【20】Malignant melanoma： A malignant proliferation of melanocytes that have the potential for local invasion and metastasis.\n\n【21】Mucosal lentiginous melanoma： Most likely arises in mucosa， opposed to skin， in the oral and anogenital regions.\n\n【22】Ocular melanoma： A primary melanoma that arises in the eye； unlike cutaneous melanoma， it is associated with early hematogenous metasta-sis to the liver.\n\n【23】ABCD criteria： Clinical criteria used for differentiating benign pigment lesions from malignant melanoma： Asymmetry (one-half does not match the other half in shape or color)， Border irregularity， Color variegation， and Diameter greater than 6 mm.\n\n【24】DISCUSSION\n\n【25】Normal skin consists of three layers： epidermis， dermis， and subcutaneous fat. The epidermis is the most superficial layer of the skin and consists of kera-tinizing squamous epithelium with regularly spaced melanocytes within the basal layer that are typically the origin of melanoma. The dermis interdigitates with the epidermis and provides support for the growing epidermis. Occasionally， melanomas arise within the dermis from melanocytic nevi.\n\n【26】Underlying the dermis is the subcutaneous fat with lobular septa， which anchors the skin to the deep connective tissues and provides cushioning and energy storage.\n\n【27】Melanoma usually arises from melanocytes in the skin； however， other sites of origin include the oral and anogenital mucosa， esophagus， meninges， and eye. Melanoma most frequently arises in chronically sun-exposed areas and commonly is associated with a melanocytic nevus. Although there is not always a clear clinical distinction between the different types of melanoma， there are four common histologic types of cutaneous melanoma with prog-nostic significance. Three of these-superficial spreading melanoma， lentigo maligna melanoma， and acral lentiginous melanoma-have an initial period of radial growth (horizontal growth within the epidermis) when the lesion increases in size without deep (vertical) invasion. It is during the radial growth phase that melanoma is most capable of being cured with total surgical exci-sion. The fourth type， nodular melanoma， does not have a recognizable radial growth phase and usually presents with deep invasion that is capable of metastasis.\n\n【28】Superficial spreading melanoma (50 to 75 percent of cases) is the most common form of melanoma， occurring most frequently on sun-exposed areas of the back and extremities. Superficial spreading melanoma initially has a period of radial growth with lesion cells extending throughout all layers of the epidermis， giving it a“Swiss cheese”appearance known as pagetoid spread. During this phase of radial growth， surgical excision is generally curative.\n\n【29】Lentigo maligna melanoma (5 to 15 percent of cases) occurs on chroni-cally sun-exposed skin such as the face， neck， and upper extremities in elderly patients. It has an extensive radial growth phase that typically is composed of single atypical melanocytes with occasional nesting limited to the basal layer of the epidermis. Thus， these lesions almost never metastasize and are cured with excision.\n\n【30】Acral lentiginous melanoma (5 to 10 percent of cases) occurs on the hair-less skin of the palms， soles， and ungual and periungual regions. It is uncom-mon in all ethnic groups but is the predominant form of melanoma in dark-skinned individuals. The term lentiginous refers to the radial extension of the lesion cells along the epidermal-dermal junction. Melanoma on acra skin tends to have a worse prognosis compared with melanoma in other sites.\n\n【31】Nodular melanoma (15 to 35 percent of cases) by definition lacks a radial growth phase and thus directly invades (vertical growth) the tissue underly-ing the epidermis. Because of the lack of radial growth， nodular melanoma tends to be well circumscribed and have a small diameter； thus， it does not tend to follow the ABCD clinical criteria used to differentiate melanoma from other benign pigmented lesions. Because of the invasive nature of this lesion， it tends to have a worse prognosis.\n\n【32】The incidence of malignant melanoma has increased significantly in the last two decades. Risk factors include habitual sun exposure， fair complexion， 删除换行1 and certain types of melanocytic nevi， such as large congenital nevi and dys-plastic nevi (atypical nevi). The most important prognostic factor for melanoma is the stage at presentation. Fortunately， the majority of melanomas are stage I or stage II and are confined to the primary lesion without any evi-dence of disease elsewhere. In stage I and stage II， a prognosis gradient is based on tumor thickness， with tumors less than 0.76 mm having a 96 to99 percent cure rate using surgical resection versus a 40 percent cure rate for tumors 3.65 mm or more. The site can affect the prognosis， with acral and mucosal melanoma having a worse prognosis than cutaneous melanoma of the extremities or back. Melanoma typically spreads through the lymphatics， with ocular melanoma being the exception； thus， sentinel lymph node biopsy at the time of surgical excision of the primary lesion can provide important prog-nostic information.\n\n【33】Basal Cell Carcinoma\n\n【34】Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common skin tumor appearing in sun-exposed older patients. These are slow-growing tumors that appear in sun-exposed areas such as the face and the forearms. They appear clinically as pearly or ulcerated lesions. On histology， they have a characteristic pearly appearance with nests of basal-like cells within the dermis. Farmers and others who are exposed to sunlight are at risk. Patients who are immunocom-promised， such as those who are HIV-infected， and those with defects in DNA repair， such as xeroderma pigmentosum， also have a high incidence of these cancers. Treatment consists of local excision.\n\n【35】Squamous Cell Carcinoma\n\n【36】Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the second most common skin tumor affecting sun-exposed areas and has a higher incidence in men. Sunlight， old burn scars， certain chemical exposures， radiation， tobacco exposure (smoking and chewing)， and chronic infections (ulcers) are risk factors. DNA damage from ultraviolet light is the most important etiology； individuals who are immunocompromised or have difficulty with DNA repair are at particular risk. Precursor lesions include squamous cell carcinoma in situ (which has not penetrated through the basement membrane) and actinic keratosis， which is also called a cutaneous horn， with marked hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis. SCC lesions are usually nodular and ulcerated and have atypical squamous epithelial cells and keratin pearls invading into the dermis. Surgical excision is the treatment of choice. Treatment of premalignant lesions with curettage， cryotherapy， or excision can prevent their progression.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

This subset includes those patients with the following characteristics：young (s35 years)， marked PA as demonstrated by spontaneous hypokalemia and plasma aldosterone concentration >30 ng/dL， and unilateral macroad-enoma on adrenaall ccoommppuutteedd tomography (CT) scan.\n\n【3】The patient was a 35-year-old man with a 4-year history of hypertension. He was treated with a three-drug program： central a2-agonist (clonidine0.2 mg daily)，calcium channel blocker (amlodipine10 mg daily)， and an angiotensin receptor blocker(valsartan 80 mg daily). Blood pressure control with these three medications was good. However， spontaneous hypokalemia had become a major problem requiring hospitalization on two occa-sions for potassium chloride infusions. At the time of referral to Mayo Clinic he was taking 80 mEq of potassium chloride daily to maintain a normal serum potassium concentration. Beyond hyperten-sion and hypokalemia， the patient was healthy. He had no signs or symptoms of Cushing syndrome. He had no first-degree relatives who had been diag-nosed with hypertension.\n\n【4】INVESTIGATIONS\n\n【5】The baseline laboratory test results are shown in Table 7.1. The patient had positive case detection testing for PA with a plasma aldosterone concentra-tion (PAC)>10 ng/dL and plasma renin activity (PRA)<1.0 ng/mL per hour. In addition， PA was confirmed because when a patient has spontaneous hypokale-mia and the PAC >20 ng/dL， there are no other dif-ferential diagnostic possibilities beyond PA.1.2 Thus formal confirmatory testing with oral sodium load-ing or a saline infusion test was not needed for this patient. The serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate(DHEA-S) concentration was mid-normal and cor-tisol suppressed normally with an overnight 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test (DST) .

This conclusion was based on the understanding that nonfunctioning adrenal nodules are uncommon in young people， and severe PA requires a large factory—typically an adre-nal macroadenoma.3.4 In a study from Mayo Clinic TOm published in 2014， although the overall accuracy of CT and magnetic resonance imaging in detecting\n\n| TABLE 7.1  | Laboratory Tests  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  | Reference  |\n| Biochemical Test  | Result  | Range  |\n| Sodium，mmol/L  | 142  | 135-145  |\n| Potassium， mmol/L  | 4.1  | 3.6-5.2  |\n| Creatinine，mg/dL  | 1.2  | 0.8-1.3  |\n| Aldosterone，ng/dL  | 54  | ≤21 ng/dL  |\n| Plasma renin activity ng/mL  | <0.6  | <0.6-3  |\n| per hour  |  |  |\n| DHEA-S， mcg/dL  | 290  | 57-522  |\n| 1-mg overnight DST  | <1.0  | <1.8  |\n\n【9】DHEA-S， Dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate； DST， dexamethasone suppression test.\n\n【10】unilateral adrenal disease in patients with PA was poor at 58.6%， adrenal imaging performed well in those patients younger than 35 years of age， with 100% accu-racy when an adrenal mass was detected. The patient understood that a cure of his hypertension with sur-gery was a reasonable goal in view of his short dura-tion of hypertension and lack of a family history of hypertension.1.5\n\n【11】TREATMENT\n\n【12】The optimal treatment of APA or unilateral hyperpla-sia is curative surgery， because hypertension control is improved in all patients and no blood pressure medications are required in 30%-60% of individu-als.4-6 In addition， quality-of-life outcomes are supe-rior with surgical cure versus medical management 删除换行1 with mineralocorticoid receptor blockade. In a ret-rospective case series from 12 centers with data for705 patients with PA who were treated surgically，259(37%)were cured of hypertension and 334(47%) were improved； complete clinical success was more likely in female and younger patients.8 Preop-erative factors predictive of some degree of persis-tent hypertension after adrenalectomy include： more than one first-degree relative with hypertension， use of more than two antihypertensive agents， older age， increased serum creatinine level， and longer duration of hypertension.\n\n【13】The patient underwent laparoscopic right adrenal-ectomy.

Most diuretic agents, including thiazides, loop diuretics, and most potassium-sparing diuretics, act at the luminal surface by inhibiting transporters. Exceptions are carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, which inhibit a cytoplasmic enzyme, and the potassium-sparing diuretic spironolactone, which inhibits steroid receptor function.  \nAnswer C is incorrect . Loop diuretics such as furosemide, bumetanide, torsemide, and ethacrynic acid bind to the chloride-binding site of the sodium-potassium-chloride sym-porter of the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. Thiazides do not act at this site.  \nAnswer D is incorrect . Aldosterone acts to increase the number of sodium-potassium exchange channels in the basolateral membrane at several sites, but especially in the collecting duct, effectively increasing sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion. Digitalis agents can act to inhibit the action of the sodiumpotassium exchange pump, but are used as in-otropes, not diuretics. Thiazides do not act on basolateral sodium channels or pumps.  \nAnswer E is incorrect . Thiazides do bind to the luminal surface of the distal convoluted tubule, but to the chloride-binding sites.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

On exam， his right lower extremity is slightly flexed， adducted， and internally rotated. It is neurovascu-larly intact.

Know the diagnostic approach to hip dislocations.\n\n【12】2\\. Understand that a native hip dislocation is an orthopaedic emergency.\n\n【13】3\\. Be familiar with the technique used to reduce a dislocated hip.\n\n【14】4\\. Know the postreduction workup and management.\n\n【15】5\\. Know the complications associated with hip dislocations.\n\n【16】Considerations\n\n【17】This 33-year-old male patient presents to the ED with a right hip dislocation 2 hours after a high-speed MVC. The first priority is a trauma workup， applying advanced trauma life support (ATLS) principles. This patient has no other injuries， and there-fore， the next step must be to evaluate the imaging obtained to rule out an associ-ated femoral neck fracture， followed by emergent reduction. It is imperative that the orthopaedist perform a complete and well-documented physical examination， noting any neurovascular compromise or other injuries to the right lower extrem-ity before reduction. Successful reduction is dependent on the ability of ED physi-cians to perform conscious sedation with good muscle relaxation. If they are unable to do this， the patient may require reduction in the operating room under general anesthesia. A repeat AP pelvis radiograph should be obtained to confirm reduction， followed by a computed tomography (CT) scan through the acetabulum. This will evaluate for a concentric reduction and the presence of any intra-articular fragments and associated fractures of the femoral head and acetabulum. After reduction， the patient's hip should be ranged and assessed for stability and a repeat neurovascular exam performed. The patient must be counseled on the risk of osteonecrosis of his hip， the high association of this injury with other injuries (ipsilateral knee injuries are common)， and hip precautions.\n\n【18】DEFINITIONS\n\n【19】OSTEONECROSIS (AVASCULAR NECROSIS)： Process by which bone tissue dies due to either a temporary or permanent disruption to the bone's blood supply. It is associated with excessive steroid use， sickle cell disease， alcoholism， deep diving(caisson disease)， Gaucher disease， lupus， and rheumatoid arthritis. It can also be posttraumatic， such as after a hip dislocation， or idiopathic in nature.\n\n【20】HIP PRECAUTIONS： Restrictions designed to prevent posterior dislocation of the hip. They are applied after total hip arthroplasty performed via a posterior approach as well as after native posterior hip dislocations. The precautions prohibit patients from crossing their legs， bending their hip past a 90-degree angle， and twist-ing their hip inward.\n\n【21】ALLIS MANEUVER： One of several described methods by which to reduce a dis-located hip. The patient is placed in the supine position， and the pelvis is stabilized by an assistant applying pressure. The physician then applies in-line longitudinal traction to the femur followed by gentle flexion of the hip to 90 degrees. Internal and external rotation of the hip ensues， with continued traction until reduction is achieved. Reduction is often signified by an audible and palpable clunk.\n\n【22】CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【23】Etiology and Mechanism of Injury\n\n【24】Posterior hip dislocations are caused by high-energy mechanisms and comprise greater than 90% of all native hip dislocations 删除33：<u></u>. They are referred to as dashboard injuries because of their high association with motor vehicle accidents in which the patient is subjected to an axial load on a flexed hip occurring when the knee is driven violently into the dashboard. Other causes include falls and athletic injuries. In all of these instances， the hip is positioned in a flexed， adducted， and internally rotated position 删除33：<u></u>. Anterior dislocations， which are uncom mon and comprise fewer than 10% of hip dislocations， occur via an external rota-tion and abduction force and are not discussed.\n\n【25】Anatomy\n\nThe inherent stability of the hip joint is provided by its ligamentous， bony， and muscular architecture， as well as the labrum. Its main blood supply is via the medial femoral circumflex artery with other contributions from the lateral femoral circum-flex artery， artery of the ligamentum teres (obturator)， and the inferior and superior gluteal arteries. The sciatic nerve lies close to the hip joint， exiting anterior to the piriformis in the greater sciatic notch.\n删除14：<u>A</u>删除14：<u>B</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 3-2. Posterior dislocation of the hip.

After this， a com-plete physical exam is performed， and in the setting of a posterior hip dislocation， the position of the patient's affected extremity is often telltale. The limb will be flexed， adducted， and internally rotated. Neurologic and vascular status must be documented. An AP pelvic radiograph should be obtained and will confirm the diagnosis. With posterior dislocations， the femoral head appears smaller than its contralateral side， joint congruency is lost， and the lesser trochanter difficult to visualize as a result of the internal rotation of the femur. The femoral neck of the affected side must be adequately visualized and evaluated for fracture， as this would change the treatment plan and require operative intervention.\n\n【29】The Thompson and Epstein classification for hip dislocation is one of the most widely used， based on radiographic characteristics， and is described in Table 3-1.\n\n【30】Treatment and Postreduction Management\n\n【31】A hip dislocation is an orthopaedic emergency， and closed reduction attempts must be performed as soon as possible to reduce the period of avascularity to the hip. It must be reiterated， however， that adequate imaging be obtained before any reduc-tion attempts to rule out an ipsilateral femoral neck fracture. Reduction can be per-formed in the ED if conscious sedation and muscle relaxation can be achieved. If adequate sedation and relaxation is unattainable in the ED， the hip must be reduced in the operating room under general anesthesia.\n\n【32】There are many described reduction techniques for posterior dislocations， including the Allis and Bigelow maneuvers and the East Baltimore lift. In the Allis maneuver， which requires the patient to be supine on the table， the patient's pelvis is stabilized by an assistant applying pressure. The physician then applies in-line lon-gitudinal traction to the femur followed by gentle flexion of the hip to 90 degrees. Internal and external rotation of the hip ensues with continued traction until reduc-tion is accomplished. Reduction is often signified by an audible and palpable clunk.\n\n【33】A repeat AP pelvic radiograph must be obtained to confirm a successful reduction. Once this is confirmed， the hip should be ranged gently to assess stability and a CT scan performed to evaluate for a concentric reduction， the presence of intraarticular fragments， and the presence of femoral head and acetabular fractures.\n\n【34】Posterior acetabular wall fractures with >40% wall disruption lead to an unstable hip， whereas it remains stable when <20% of the wall is disrupted. An irreducible hip dislocation， which is caused by bony or soft-tissue interposition within the joint， requires emergent open surgical intervention to reduce the pressure on the hip’s artic-ular cartilage and subsequent risk for avascular necrosis. A nonconcentric reduction may also require open operative intervention or skeletal traction for the same reasons seen with irreducible hips.\n\n【35】If the hip is found to be clinically and radiographically stable after reduction， an abduction pillow or knee immobilizer must be used to prevent inadvertent move-ments by the patient that could compromise reduction and cause recurrent disloca-tion. Strict hip precautions should be enforced at all times and prohibit patients from crossing their legs， bending their hip past a 90-degree angle， and twisting their hip inward.\n\n【36】There is no one specific approach to rehabilitation after a hip dislocation， and the patient's weight-bearing status and need for postreduction traction or bed rest are controversial and surgeon dependent.\n\n【37】Complications\n\n【38】The risk of developing posttraumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head is what makes hip dislocations an orthopaedic emergency. The critical time to reduction， which in theory will restore blood flow to the femoral head， has not been defini-tively determined. However， it is thought that a greatly increased risk of avascular necrosis occurs with a delay in reduction of greater than 6 to 12 hours. It is impor-tant to note that those who incur hip dislocations via higher energy mechanisms are more likely to develop osteonecrosis as a result of greater initial damage to the surrounding blood supply. Osteonecrosis commonly occurs within 2 years. Other complications include development of posttraumatic arthritis， sciatic nerve palsy， and recurring dislocations. Furthermore， many patients presenting with hip disloca-tions have other significant systemic injuries as well as ipsilateral knee and bony injuries.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

He says other doctors have given him such prescriptions in the past.\n\n【3】Questions\n\n【4】• What reasons have you for declining this request?\n\n【5】• Can you offer treatment privately instead?\n\n【6】ANSWER 57\nThe services of the National Health Service are freely available to any resident in the United  删除换行5 Kingdom. This includes any visitor from abroad, for emergency care. There are reciprocal  删除换行1 agreements with the governments of some countries and not others and this can be checked  删除换行1 by looking at NHS websites. If a registered patient travels abroad, you may prescribe a reasonable quantity of their own drugs for personal use – up to 3 months of his own anti-hypertensive medication would be acceptable. But this privilege does not extend to residents of  删除换行1 other countries: the NHS cannot accept the burden of healthcare for anyone in the world.\nFurthermore, you may not treat a patient for whom you do not have clinical responsibility.At the very least, you must have seen and examined the patient and be in a position to do  删除换行1 the same again when needed. So it is impossible for you to issue a prescription in his father’s  删除换行1 name, either NHS or private. Writing the prescription in the patient’s own name would be  删除换行1 improper behaviour, which could lead to your facing a stricture from the General Medical  删除换行5 Council. If the medication is not marked in the British National Formulary as ‘Prescriptiononly Medicine’ (POM) he may be able to buy it from a chemist over the counter, but will need  删除换行1 to check with the airline whether he can carry it in his luggage. If he brings his father to the \n\n【7】United Kingdom, you must point out that he would still not be entitled to NHS treatment,  删除换行1 as his pre-existing condition would not be classed as an emergency. Whether you could treat  删除换行1 him as a private patient would depend on your practice’s policy regarding such care; it is  删除换行1 a good idea to ensure your practice has a protocol for such situations, drawn up with the  删除换行1 guidance of your medical insurance advisers, and your local clinical commissioning groups  删除换行1 (CCGs). In this case, he is disappointed at your refusal.\n\n【8】If his trip is likely to be more than 3 months, you may offer to give him a letter, summarizing  删除换行1 his own current medical state, and listing his own treatment: he will need to get more supplies of his medication while he is abroad, and he should be warned that he may face the same  删除换行1 supply difficulties that his father is experiencing, as UK treatments are by no means widely  删除换行1 available worldwide; don’t forget to remind him to keep his travel immunizations up to date,  删除换行1 and to take his antimalarials if required.\n\n【9】• Be aware of entitlement for treatment for overseas visitors and NHS patients seeking treatment abroad. This information can be found on the Department of Health  删除换行1 website.\n\n【10】• A doctor prescribing a medication bears responsibility for that treatment and  删除换行1 must know the patient and the patient’s condition and be able to follow up the  删除换行1 treatment outcomes.\n删除12：<u>Key Points117\n\n【11】删除29：<u>Case 58: Memory Loss</u>\n\n【12】</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

He previously failed treatment with cyclosporine 5 mg twice each day and has been taking adalimumab 40 mg every other week for the past 4 months. He has noticed minimal improvement with adalimumab and desires re-evaluation of his treatment regimen. He admits to a 15 kg weight gain in the past 6 months. He denies injection site reactions, fever, cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis, night sweats, headaches, edema, muscle weakness, tingling, numbness, or joint pain. His sister has psoriasis controlled with topical corticosteroids.\n\n【14】On physical examination , the patient is morbidly obese. Erythematous, scaly, indurated papules and plaques are visible on the scalp, face, neck, bilateral arms, bilateral legs, and abdomen 删除33：<u></u>. He defers exam of the groin and buttocks. Approximately 40% of examined body surface area is affected.\n\n【15】删除3：<u>Figure 11.1\n\n【16】Large, erythematous, well-demarcated plaque with fine micaceous scale on the abdomen</u>\n\n【17】Based on the patient’s history and physical examination, what is the best treatment option?\n\n【18】1.  1.\n    Continue adalimumab as prescribed\n2.  2.\n    Increase adalimumab to 40 mg weekly\n3.  3.\n    Switch to etanercept\n4.  4.\n    Switch to infliximab\n5.  5.\n    Switch to apremilast\n\n【19】Treatment\n---------\n\n【20】Switch to infliximab\n\n【21】Discussion\n----------\n\n【22】Compared to the general population, children and adults with psoriasis have higher prevalence of metabolic risk factors, including increased body weight, adiposity, elevated waist circumference, dyslipidemia, and type II diabetes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. A correlation between obesity, defined as body mass index (BMI) greater than 30, and psoriasis was initially reported by a 1986 study of nearly 160,000 individuals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Since then, many investigations of this association have been pursued, and in 2007 the International Psoriasis Council affirmed the relationship in a review of over 10,000 patients from these studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Subsequent studies have observed a correlation between obesity and severity of psoriasis. In an analysis of over 4000 patients with psoriasis, the overlap between prevalence of obesity and mild, moderate, and severe psoriasis was 14%, 34%, and 66%, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】The pathophysiology of the relationship between obesity and psoriasis has not been fully elucidated, though it has been found that elevated BMI can predict psoriasis development. In a cohort of nearly 9000 individuals initially unaffected with psoriasis followed over a 14-year period, incidence of psoriasis correlated with increasing BMI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. It is hypothesized that systemic inflammation induced by obesity may bring on and worsen psoriatic skin findings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Overexpression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha is known to occur in adipose tissue of obese patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Likewise, TNF-alpha upregulation has been demonstrated in psoriatic lesions, and drug-induced inhibition of TNF has proven to be effective in treating psoriasis. Others claim that inflammation from psoriasis may predispose to the development of obesity, though evidence is limited 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Moreover, social stigma and psychological burden associated with psoriasis may lead to increased alcohol intake, reduced physical activity, and increased saturated fat consumption, leading to weight gain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Obese patients with psoriasis have poorer adherence to therapy than their counterparts with normal BMI, leading to further worsening of cutaneous symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】Many studies have found that psoriasis patients with obesity have reduced response to standard doses of drug therapy. A large cohort study found the odds ratio for reaching 75% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) scores at follow-up in normal-BMI patients compared to obese patients to be 0.73 at 8 weeks and 0.62 at 16 weeks. These results were consistent among different types of systemic therapy at standard doses, including psoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA), acitretin, cyclosporine, methotrexate, and various biologics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Therefore, weight-based dose adjustment may be warranted to ensure adequate therapy in overweight and obese patients.\n\n【25】Ustekinumab , a IL-12/23 inhibitor, is among few psoriasis biologics that incorporates weight into dosing. For patients who weigh over 100 kg, the dose is doubled from the typical 45–90 mg, making it a reasonable treatment option for obese patients. Data from the phase III PHOENIX 1 and PHOENIX 2 trials showed improved response with increasing dose of ustekinumab with increasing body weight, irrespective of height 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. A smaller and more recent study conducted in Japan found that BMI negatively correlates with reduction of PASI scores with use of a consistent dose of ustekinumab, while body weight regardless of height does not 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Infliximab is the only widely used biologic for psoriasis that utilizes true weight-based dosing. The standard prescription is 5 mg/kg per dose, making it a superior option for patients who are obese or overweight. Furthermore, infliximab has been uniquely proven to have consistent efficacy when uniform dosing is utilized across a range of BMIs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. The additional simplicity and cost-effectiveness of dosing that it affords makes it among the best treatment options for patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis and obesity. An effective non-biologic treatment option for obese patients with mild psoriasis is PUVA, since the dose of psoralen can be weight-adjusted. However, large body habitus results in increased proximity to phototherapy bulbs during treatment, leading to elevated risk for phototherapy-induced erythema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】Weight reduction may also reduce severity of psoriatic skin lesions in overweight and obese patients. One randomized controlled trial of 60 psoriasis patients with BMI greater than 27 found that participants issued a low-calorie diet leading to mean weight loss of 15.4 kg had significantly improved PASI scores and Dermatology Quality of Life Index scores 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. Another study showed improved response to cyclosporine therapy in obese patients co-managed with a low-calorie diet that led to body weight reduction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. Psoriasis patients who undergo bariatric surgery have been documented to have improvement in cutaneous symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. Following gastric bypass, suppression of appetite is mediated by dramatic increases in glucagon-like peptide-1, an incretin shown to have anti-inflammatory effects that may alleviate psoriasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>.\n\n【27】According to the National Psoriasis Foundation , there is insufficient evidence to formulate a uniform treatment algorithm for obese psoriasis patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Nonetheless, a multidisciplinary approach should be utilized, which involves working with the patient’s primary care physician to control both psoriasis and metabolic disease. When determining a therapeutic regimen, it is important to consider the metabolic side effect profile of each drug utilized. Methotrexate and cyclosporine may augment risk of hepatic and renal toxicity, and acitretin has increased risk of hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>. The phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor apremilast has been found to be associated with significant weight loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>, a favorable side effect in obese patients. However, patient weight correlates inversely with PASI improvement when using apremilast, and weight-based dosing is not available 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】This patient was switched from adalimumab to infliximab therapy. He also began a diet and exercise regimen under guidance by his primary care doctor. At follow-up 2 months later, he had lost 15 pounds and his body surface area involvement decreased to 1%.\n\n【29】Key Points\n----------\n\n【30】   Psoriasis is associated with obesity, a relationship that is likely mediated by underlying systemic inflammation present in both disorders.\n   The most effective therapies for psoriasis in obese patients are those with weight-based dosing regimens as well as PUVA. Infliximab is the simplest and most cost-effective biologic to use since its efficacy at a uniform dose is consistent across multiple BMIs.\n   In obese patients, it is critical to avoid therapies with adverse effects that can exacerbate metabolic disease, including methotrexate, cyclosporine, and acitretin.\n\n【31】###", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Hair and scale samples were collected with scraping and examined under a light microscope with 20% KOH solution, detecting spindle-shaped multicellular macroconidia. The source of infection was demonstrated to be a dog kept as a pet by the family for several years. The dog had no evidence of clinical lesions.\n\n【20】Tinea faciei presents a dermatophytic infection of the facial region. The dermatophytes are fungal infections caused by three genera (Tichphyton spp; Microsporum spp. Epidermophyton spp), with the ability to invade and multiply within the keratinized tissue (hair, skin, nails). The typical clinical presentation is erythematous annular plaques with scaling borders, pustules, and crusts may be present too. Lesions may assume other shapes also, such as the oval, circinate, and arcuate. Typically the lesions spread centrifugally with central clearing, and an advancing inflammatory border is seen in most cases. The lesions can be single, presenting as a plaque or patch, or they can be multiple. Tinea corporis might result in a spread from human to human, animal to human, and soil to human. Domestic animals are an important factor in transmitting the infection, especially the zoophilic species. Infections due to zoophilic organisms such as Microsporum canis tend to be associated with severe inflammatory changes. In contrast, anthropophilic organisms such as Trichophyton tonsurans may be associated with minimal inflammation and fine scaling 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】Tinea faciei accounts for about 3–4% of all cases of tinea corporis, frequently reported in tropical countries. It affects all age groups, with two peaks in children between 2 and 14 years and adults between 20 and 40 years of age. Both trichophyton and microsporum species can cause tinea facie 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】Dermatophytic infections are common during childhood, but they can be misdiagnosed because of their polymorphic clinical appearance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. A typical clinical presentation, e.g. annular configuration, scales, pustules in the borders, usually does not pose a challenge in being diagnosed by a trained eye. Atypical forms may lead to misdiagnosis and delayed recovery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】An Italian study analyzed 154 cases of atypical tinea. The authors concluded that clinical atypia is not a consequence of TCS but present at the onset of the illness due to the variable dermatophyte’s invasive capacity, the site of the invasion, and acquired conditions such as excessive washing or sun exposure . Therefore Azori et al. suggest that “tinea atypica” rather than “tinea incognito” includes all forms of dermatophytosis that do not present the classic features for both primary and secondary pathomorphosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】The variations in the clinical presentation result from the dermatophyte’s characteristics and a combination of patients’ immunity response . Other factors may also contribute, including excessive washing, sun exposure, and the use of cosmetic products. The eventual prescription of TCS or calcineurin inhibitors further induces pathomorphosis (tinea incognito), leading to longstanding disease.\n\n【25】The factors responsible for the increase in the disease incidence are untreated contacts with superficial dermatophytosis, inappropriate treatment with incorrectly prescribed or over-the-counter steroid-containing triple/quadruple combination creams, and inadequate dosing and duration of antifungal therapy. Clinical presentation with large patches and extensive body surface area involvement is common.\n\n【26】The differential diagnosis of tinea faciei includes lupus vulgaris, granuloma annulare, demodicosis, erythema chronicum migrans, annular psoriasis, subacute lupus cutaneous, perioral dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis.\n\n【27】In tropical countries, where epidemiologically tuberculosis is very common, tinea atypica or tinea incognito can lead to suspect lupus vulgaris. Typically lupus vulgaris presents as a slowly progressive irregular and an infiltrative plaque with central atrophic scarring and advancing borders. However, the early evolving lesions may not show scarring. Granuloma annulare is also characterized by the annular erythematous plaques with an elevated periphery and a depressed center. The lesions are mostly localized in the hands, feet, and wrists, but can also be located anywhere in the body, including the face. Annular psoriasis typically presents as plaques with diffuse thick, white scales, but it can also present as annular lesions with scale only on the borders. Erythema chronicum migrans is the cutaneous hallmark of Lyme disease. One or more large erythematous patches may appear anywhere on the skin. The lesions expand centrifugally, sometimes with central clearing, giving rise to annular patches. The neonatal cutaneous lupus erythematosus may present with polycyclic annular lesions.

His blood pressure is 180/90 mm Hg and heart rate is 135/min. After a complete work-up, the patient is diagnosed with a pheochromocytoma, and his physician recommends surgery. Which of the following is the most appropriate preoperative management for this patient?\n\n【1】> (A) α-Blockade followed by β-blockade\n\n【2】> (B) β-Blockade followed by α-blockade\n\n【3】> (C) Levothyroxine\n\n【4】> (D) Prednisone\n\n【5】> (E) Propylthiouracil\n Answer: The correct answer is A . This patient has a pheochromocytoma, a chromaffin cell tumor of the adrenal medulla that secretes excess epinephrine and norepinephrine. Signs and symptoms of pheochromocytoma include episodic hypertension, headache, sweating, tachycardia, palpitations, and pallor. Pheochromocytomas may occur sporadically or as part of the MEN syndromes, which are a group of autosomal dominant syndromes in which more than one endocrine organ is dysfunctional. Given his history of thyroid carcinoma requiring a thryoidectomy, this patient most likely has MEN type II, which is characterized by the combination of medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, pheochromocytoma, and parathyroid hyperplasia. Pheochromocytomas are treated surgically, but must first be managed preoperatively with both a nonselective α-antagonist (usually phenoxybenzamine) to normalize blood pressure, followed by a β-blocker (eg, propranolol) to control tachycardia. The β-blocker should never be started prior to α-blockade because it would result in unopposed α-receptor stimulation, leading to a further elevation in blood pressure.  \nAnswer B is incorrect . Pheochromocytomas are treated surgically, but must first be managed preoperatively with both a nonselective α-antagonist (usually phenoxybenzamine) to normalize blood pressure, followed by a β-blocker (eg, propranolol) to control tachycardia. The β-blocker should never be started prior to α-blockade because it would result in unopposed α-receptor stimulation, leading to a further elevation in blood pressure.  \nAnswer C is incorrect . Levothyroxine is thyroid hormone replacement that is used to treat hypothyroidism and myxedema. It is not indicated in the treatment of pheochromocytoma.  \nAnswer D is incorrect . Prednisone is a glucocorticoid that is used to treat many inflammatory, allergic, and immunologic disorders, but is not indicated in the treatment of pheochromocytoma.  \nAnswer E is incorrect . Propylthiouracil is used to treat hyperthyroidism. It acts by inhibiting the organification and coupling of thyroid hormone synthesis, and by decreasing the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 .

She describes the abdominal pain as sharp and focused in the right epigastric area. She denies vomiting， diarrhea， or constipation. Her typical diet consists of pizza， hot dogs， and salads. Rachel denies any association of her symptoms with food or hunger Her last normal menstrual period was 3 weeks ago， and she has had 2 negative pregnancy tests at home.\n\n【3】Past medical history： She delivered her son 6 months ago vaginally without complications. Her only other medical history includes a kidney infection 4 months ago.\n\n【4】Social history： She smokes 7 cigarettes a day but admits， “I really don’t need them. I am bored.\"Rachel lives with her boyfriend (the father of her child) and his parents. She moved in， far away from her home， only recently. Her parents made her leave their house when she told them she was preg nant， and they have no contact with her. She states that she feels safe at home and is enjoying her baby. Her boyfriend helps with the baby but often goes out at night with his friends and leaves her at home with the baby. She feels a little isolated because everyone works during the day and she has no access to transportation. She is dependent on her in-laws if she needs to go anywhere by car， and they do not often support her need to go anywhere. Otherwise， she walks. She walked here today for her appointment.\n\n【5】Medication： She is not allergic to any medication and only takes birth control pills.\n\n【6】OBJECTIVE\n\n【7】Vital signs： Rachel is afebrile. BP is 120/80. Pulse is 68 and regular.\n\n【8】Eyes： PERRLA. EOMs are intact. Optic disks are sharp.\n\n【9】Cardiac： Cardiac exam reveals regular rate and rhythm.\n\n【10】Respiratory： Respirations are 12， steady， and unlabored. Lungs are clear.\n\n【11】Abdomen： Soft with mild tenderness to palpation (TTP) in the RUQ with a negative Murphy's sign. There is no CVA tenderness.\n\n【12】Genitourinary： A urine dipstick reveals positive protein. A urine HCG is negative.\n\n【13】Rachel is diagnosed this first visit with possible cholecystitis and is given Antivert 12.5mg for her nausea. Blood is drawn and sent to the lab. Her urine is sent for analysis， and she is told to return in1 week.\n\n【14】Rachel returns 1 week later. Her blood work reveals fasting blood glucose of 11 mg/dL. Her other blood work is within normal limits. Her urinalysis returns with few bacteria and no protein. Rachel reports that the abdominal pain has worsened and that she now has headaches， as well. She denies a history of migraines or headaches. Her vision is blurry， and she is sensitive to light and sound. Her nausea is still present but decreased.\n\n【15】Her exam remains unchanged.\n\n【16】CRITICAL THINKING\n\n【17】Which diagnostic or imaging studies should be considered to assist with or confirm the diagnosis?\n\n【18】Abdominal ultrasound\n\n【19】F Abdominal CT scan\n\n【20】Head CT scan\n\n【21】KUB x-ray\n\n【22】\\\\CBC\n\n【23】NMetabolic panel\n\n【24】LFTs\n\n【25】Insulin level\n\n【26】\\\\C-peptide\n\n【27】OGGT\n\n【28】Gastrin level\n\n【29】What is the most likely differential diagnosis and why?\n\n【30】Cholelithiasis\n\n【31】Gastroenteritis\n\n【32】Diverticulitis\n\n【33】Insulin tumor\n\n【34】Gastric tumor\n\n【35】\\\\Cholecystitis\n\n【36】What should be the plan of treatment at this point?\n\n【37】Are any referrals needed?\n\n【38】Does the patient's home situation influence your plan?\n\n【39】RESOLUTION\n\n【40】Diagnostic Testing： In addition to urine testing， Rachel should have had a metabolic panel， hepatic function panel， and CBC. Once her fasting blood sugar was noted to be 11 mg/dL， a fasting insulin level， c-peptide， and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) should have been ordered. Her first insulin level was 43uIU/mL (normal≤17)， and her c-peptide was 5.1 (normal=0.8-3.1ng/mL). These levels are suspicious for an insulinoma. A gastric tumor must also be ruled out as Rachel has abdominal pain. Therefore， a gastrin level was obtained which was normal. Rachel told the clinician that she 删除换行1 had not eaten when the test was done. It was necessary to repeat this to be sure that Rachel fasted， and the best way to do this was to have these labs repeated just prior to beginning the OGTT which would also support or refute a diagnosis of an insulinoma. Rachel's fasting levels， including the OGTT turned out to be normal， and both an insulin tumor and a gastric tumor were ruled out.\n\n【41】The abdominal pain required an abdominal ultrasound to confirm or rule out cholecystitis or gallstones. When Rachel mentioned the new onset headache， especially accompanied by the visual change， a CT scan of the head was ordered.\n\n【42】Rachel returns in 2 weeks and states that she did not go for the imaging you suggested because of lack of transportation. She is following a low fat diet per your recommendations and her abdominal pain feels slightly better. Now， she denies any headaches， nausea， and dizziness. On exam， she has RUQ TTP and a positive Murphy's sign.\n\n【43】What is the most likely differential diagnosis and why?\n\n【44】Rachel most likely has cholecystitis. The positive Murphy's sign with RUQ pain and nausea support the diagnosis. Her fatty diet clearly contributes to her condition， even though she denies any associ-ated pattern with food.\n\n【45】What should be the plan of treatment at this point?\n\n【46】Rachel should be assisted to obtain transportation， and the clinician should check if there is a location within walking distance where she can get the tests done. Since Rachel's headaches resolved before she could get the CT scan of her head， it is possible to make a case for holding off on the CT scan (to avoid unnecessary radiation) and instead perform teaching to make Rachel aware of when to go to the emergency room or to report to the clinic if headaches resume.\n\n【47】Rachel still needs the abdominal ultrasound. She should be asked to return to the clinic to review the results and to review her diet progress. It is also advisable to recommend that Rachel stop smoking for the sake of herself and her babv.\n\n【48】Are any referrals needed?\n\n【49】A referral may be needed to a gastroenterologist to further assess the cholecystitis and to establish a baseline for the condition of the gallbladder as surgical options are considered.\n\n【50】Does the patient's home situation influence your plan?\n\n【51】Rachel's home life does play a role in her care. She has trouble getting her in-laws to support her need for transportation or her boyfriend to support her need for socialization. The clinician should coach her and provide support to assist her in helping her in-laws and boyfriend to understand that she needs transportation for her health needs and that of her baby and also to help her make friends in her new location. Rachel is at risk for depression and the consequences of social isolation. This could then put her at high risk for child abuse. The clinician should also offer to speak with the family. It is important that the clinician act as a confidante and support for Rachel while being careful not to malign her family.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Both cramps and bleeding started about two hours ago. Pain is constant, with intermittent episodes of severe cramping. Bleeding has been sufficient to soak through four to five pads within the past few hours. She denies a history of trauma or leakage of clear fluid. She does admit to using cocaine three times within the past month, most recently last night. She is afebrile, blood pressure is 155/95 mm Hg, and heart rate is 100/min. Bi-manual examination reveals tenderness over the fundus and a nondilated cervix. Ultrasound reveals a normally implanted placenta with no visible abnormalities. Fetal heart rate is in the 170-180/min range. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【1】> (A) Abruptio placentae\n\n【2】> (B) Concealed abruption\n\n【3】> (C) Labor\n\n【4】> (D) Placenta accreta\n\n【5】> (E) Placenta previa\n\n【6】 Answer: The correct answer is A. Abruptio placentae typically presents as bleeding along with uterine contractions and pain due to premature separation of the placenta from the uterus, despite its implantation in a normal location. It is caused most often by a rupture of defective maternal vessels in the decidua basalis. This patient is at high risk for abruptio placentae because of her known hypertension and cocaine use. Other risk factors include short umbilical cord, trauma, prior abruption, cigarette smoking, uterine fibroids, advanced age, sudden uterine decompression, preterm premature rupture of the membranes, and a bleeding diathesis. Whereas ultrasound can reveal abruptio placentae, it is not very sensitive and will be positive in only 25% of cases of abruption confirmed at delivery.  \nAnswer B is incorrect. Concealed abruption refers to abruptio placentae that occurs near the center of the placenta. By definition, there is no external bleeding because the blood forms a hematoma that is hidden behind the placenta. Thus this case cannot represent a concealed abruption.  \nAnswer C is incorrect. Labor is defined as regular uterine contractions that result in cervical change. This patient does not describe contractions at regular intervals, but rather a constant pain with intermittent cramping. In addition, her cervix remains closed, so she has not started labor.  \nAnswer D is incorrect. Placenta accreta refers to the abnormally strong adherence of the placenta to the uterine wall. This happens because the placental villi attach directly to the myometrium as a result of a defect in the decidua basalis layer. Placenta accreta manifests as incomplete separation of the placenta after delivery and can result in severe postpartum hemorrhage. Risk factors include placenta previa, prior cesarean delivery, and prior intrauterine manipulation or surgery. The most common setting for accreta involves a placenta previa after a prior cesarean delivery.  \nAnswer E is incorrect. Placenta previa occurs when the placenta overlies the internal cervical os. The distinction between placenta previa and abruptio placentae is classically made based on the presence (abruptio placentae) or absence (placenta previa) of pain.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The previous day he complained of tiredness, but had been playing a lot of football with his friends and training at a club. He watched  删除换行1 television during the evening and apparently slept well. The morning of the admission he  删除换行1 had been quieter than usual but had gone to school. His mother was phoned to say that his  删除换行1 behaviour was very out of character; he was refusing to obey commands and looked ‘spaced  删除换行1 out’. At home Jake seemed unable to perform simple tasks such as changing his clothes, putting on his pyjamas, rather than his shorts. He then became rather jumpy and nervous. He  删除换行1 denies any headache and there have been no abnormal movements witnessed. He has had  删除换行1 no diarrhoea or vomiting. Jake has no significant past medical history. His older brother has  删除换行1 epilepsy, which is well controlled with lamotrigine. Jake struggles at school, needing extra  删除换行1 help with literacy and maths. There were some minor behaviour problems in his junior  删除换行1 school, but nothing since.\n\n【3】Examination\n\n【4】Jake looks generally well. His height is on the 91st centile and his weight is on the 75th centile.\nHe is afebrile. His pulse is 88 beats/min and his blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg. Examination  删除换行1 of the cardiovascular, respiratory and abdominal systems is unremarkable. There is no  删除换行1 meningism. When asked, he does not know the day of the week, which town the hospital is  删除换行1 in, or his birthday. He cannot remember the name of his favourite football club. He becomes  删除换行1 agitated and aggressive when being questioned and is very slow to answer. Both pupils appear  删除换行1 dilated and have a slightly sluggish response to light. He is uncooperative with attempts at  删除换行1 fundoscopy. There are no obvious focal neurological signs, but he cannot understand the  删除换行1 instructions for the tests of cerebellar function, e.g. finger–nose test. His gait is normal.\n\n【5】Questions\n\n【6】• What further history should you specifically obtain?\n\n【7】• What other investigations would you request and why?\n\n【8】ANSWER 93\n\n【9】This previously healthy teenage boy has developed an acute confusional state. One of the  删除换行1 most obvious causes is drug ingestion, either recreational or a deliberate overdose, possibly  删除换行1 with his brother’s lamotrigine. It is important to ask the family specific questions. Has he  删除换行1 been out of their sight? Are there any other drugs in the house? If necessary, send them home  删除换行1 to check and make sure none are missing. Phone the school and his friends. All these steps  删除换行1 could be life-saving. A urine screen for ‘drugs of abuse’ and toxicology, including lamotrigine,  删除换行1 should be requested, but the result will take some time.\n\n【10】However, never jump to conclusions – there are numerous other possibilities. With an acute  删除换行1 history, metabolic problems are unlikely, although they must be excluded. Hyponatraemia  删除换行1 could be due to inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion following an unreported head  删除换行1 injury. Hypercalcaemia and renal failure are likely to have a more insidious onset and other  删除换行1 symptoms, such as tiredness. Thyroid disease is a possibility. Thyrotoxicosis can present with  删除换行1 an isolated behaviour disturbance such as school phobia. At this age, a previously undiagnosed inborn error of metabolism is unlikely but is certainly possible, especially in a child  删除换行1 with learning difficulties. Measure blood sugar (bedside and laboratory), a venous pH, lactate  删除换行1 and ammonia. Keep urine for amino and organic acid analysis. Ask the laboratory to keep  删除换行1 any spare blood in case it is needed for future analysis. Most will do so for up to 6 months.\n\n【11】Even in the absence of clinical signs, bacterial and viral infections are possible diagnoses.\nThey are also treatable. Send a full blood count, C-reactive protein, blood cultures, a midstream urine and acute viral titres. If indicated, convalescent titres can be sent 10–14 days  删除换行1 later. It is safest to start treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics, e.g. ceftriaxone, and  删除换行1 aciclovir. A lumbar puncture is currently contraindicated because he is very confused, and  删除换行1 raised intracranial pressure cannot be excluded. It may be indicated once he has improved.\n\n【12】An acute neurological event must also be excluded, including seizures and migraine. He merits an urgent CT and/or a MRI scan and an EEG.\n\n【13】This boy’s EEG the following day showed generalized bursts of spike and slow-wave activity  删除换行1 with a frontotemporal emphasis. He recovered within 24  hours, but went on to have further similar episodes of confusion, culminating in a generalized seizure. The final diagnosis was complex partial epilepsy with secondary generalization. He responded very well to  删除换行1 anticonvulsants.\n\n【14】Key Points\n\n【15】• Do everything possible to identify any drug that a child might have taken inadvertently or deliberately. It might save their life.\n\n【16】• Never assume that an acute confusional state is due to drug ingestion at any age.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Her BP in the office is 160/ 95 and 162/90. The urine protein is negative.\n\n【36】16.10 A 24-year-old G3P2 woman at 34 weeks’gestation is noted to have pre-eclampsia. The BP is 150/90 and P/ C ratio is 0.5. A fetal ultrasound shows the estimated fetal weight is at the 8th percentile.\n\n【37】ANSWERS\n\n【38】16.1 E. A severe feature of preeclampsia  may or may not necessi-tate immediate delivery. In this case， DIC is the most concerning condition and requires delivery at any gestational age. Pedal edema is not pathologic； nondependent edema， such as of the face and hands， may be consistent with preeclampsia but does not indicate severity of disease. Low platelets are associ-ated with HELLP syndrome， a form of hemolytic anemia in pregnancy， and are very worrisome. Uric acid levels are known to be elevated with preeclampsia； however， it is not a criterion for severe preeclampsia. In general， the criteria for severe preeclampsia indicate end-organ threat， and generally require delivery for gestational age at or>34 weeks， and depending on the nature of the threat and the stability of the patient， perhaps delivery at an earlier gestational age.\n\n【39】16.2C. Although the pregnancy is only 28 weeks， in light of the severe feature of preeclampsia with marked thrombocytopenia， the best treatment is magnesium sulfate and delivery. When preeclampsia with severe features is diagnosed， delivery depends on the nature of the threat， the stability of the patient/fetus， and the gestational age. If the platelet count was higher通用删除7(英):<u>(90000)</u>， expectant management may be entertained at a tertiary center. Oral antihypertensive therapy， such as labetalol， may be given to the patient to control blood pressure； however， it should not be used as the‘treatment”for severe preeclampsia. The platelet levels are not low enough to require transfusion； intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is used for various auto-immune diseases， but not indicated in this patient.\n\n【40】16.3 A. The most common cause of maternal death due to eclampsia is intra-cerebral hemorrhage. Eclampsia is one of the most feared complications of preeclampsia， and the greatest risk for occurrence is just prior to deliv-ery， during labor (intrapartum)， and within the first 24 hours'postpartum. Patients with gestational hypertension or preeclampsia without severe fea-tures do not necessarily require magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis. This patient has a severe headache which is a severe feature. Magnesium sulfate has been proven to be superior to other anticonvulsants such as valium， Dilantin， or phenobarbital. One dictum that is useful in the emer-gency room or obstetrical unit is that “a pregnant patient greater than 20weeks'gestation without a history of epilepsy who presents with seizures has eclampsia until other wise proven.\n\n【41】16.4 D. In the preterm patient with mild preeclampsia， expectant management is generally employed until severe features are noted or the pregnancy reaches 37 weeks. In other words， the risks of prematurity usually outweigh the risks of the preeclampsia until end-organ threat is manifest. Had this patient been at term，the best step in management would be to induce labor； this is because at term， the risks of prematurity are minimal. Severe， but not mild hypertension associated with preeclampsia， should be controlled with hypertensive medication. Antihypertensive agents are useful in chronic 删除换行1 hypertension but not in preeclampsia unless the BP is in the severe range； lowering these BPs can help avoid stroke. For the patient in this scenario， neither induction nor cesarean section is indicated since she is not yet at term. It is not a requirement for a preeclamptic patient to deliver by cesar-ean. This patient can be followed as an outpatient with twice weekly BP checks and once a week platelet count， Cr， and LFTs.\n\n【42】16.5 D. Pulmonary edema is an indication for delivery at a preterm gestation. Proteinuria of 5 g over 24 hours is no longer criteria of a severe feature of preeclampsia and does not correspond to maternal or fetal outcome. Mild thrombocytopenia 通用删除7(英):<u>(80 000-100000)</u> that is stable may be judiciously observed in this patient (in a tertiary care center). A DIC panel should be performed to ensure there is not a coagulopathy， since that would be an indication for immediate delivery.\n\n【43】16.6 C. This patient is postpartum and likely has preeclampsia based on the elevated BP and the proteinuria. The symptoms may be due to PRES syn-drome， which needs to be quickly diagnosed by MR imaging， since aggres-sive therapy must be enacted to prevent long-term brain dysfunction. An antihypertensive agent does not generally need to be used unless the BP is severe (160 systolic or 110 diastolic). CT imaging can discern an intracranial bleed， and is useful if the patient had an eclamptic episode. Eye drops would be indicated with a conjunctivitis.\n\n【44】16.7 C. A biophysical profile should be performed. A patient with chronic hyper-tension that is well controlled should be monitored carefully for superim-posed preeclampsia， complications such as abruption， serial ultrasound examinations to assess for IUGR， fetal testing such as BPP weekly， and deliv-ered at 38 to 39 weeks.\n\n【45】16.8 A. Corticosteroid therapy is the single most important intervention to impact on the neonatal outcome in a pregnancy <34 weeks when delivery is expected imminently (within 7 days). Magnesium sulfate is often given during this time of carefully monitoring the platelet count and liver function tests， but not necessarily delivery. This change in carefully observing patients with stable mild thrombocytopenia and stable elevated LFTs is based on the knowledge of antenatal corticosteroid impact on neonatal outcome.\n\n【46】16.9 B. This patient has severely elevated BP and must receive an antihyperten-sive agent ASAP to reduce the risk of stroke. This may be IV labetolol， IV hydralazine， or oral nifedipine. Although corticosteroids and BPP are viable answer choices， the highest priority is to lower the BP.\n\n【47】16.10 C. This patient likely has IUGR. The next step would be to evaluate pos-sible fetal compromise with BPP and umbilical artery Doppler studies. At34 weeks， corticosteroid therapy is not effective. Magnesium sulfate and delivery is an option， but more information such as assessment of fetal sta-tus would give a more complete picture. The BPs are in the mild range， and so an antihypertensive agent is not needed.\n\n【48】CLINICAL PEARLS\n\n【49】In general， the treatment of gestational hypertension or preeclampsia without severe features at or beyond 37 weeks'gestation is delivery. Use of magnesium sulfate is individualized.\n\n【50】》 The management of preeclampsia without severe features in a preterm pregnancy is observation until severe features are noted， or term gestation is reached.\n\n【51】Severe features complicating preeclampsia or superimposed preeclamp-sia at a gestationalage of34 weeks or higher should be given magnesium sulfate and delivered. Those <34 weeks may be judiciously observed in specialized facilities.\n\n【52】》 The most common cause of significant proteinuria in pregnancy is preeclampsia.\n删除26：<u>)</u>Magnesium sulfate is the best anticonvulsant to prevent eclampsia.\n\n【53】》 The first sign ofmagnesium toxicity is loss ofdeep tendon reflexes.\n\n【54】》Chronic hypertension is diagnosed when a pregnant woman has hyper-tension prior to 20 weeks' gestation， or if the hypertension persists beyond 12 weeks'postpartum.\n\n【55】》 Gestational hypertension is when a pregnant woman has hypertension after 20 weeks of gestation without proteinuria or other evidence of preeclampsia.\n\n【56】Acute onset severe hypertension (160 systolic or 110 diastolic) persisting>15 minutes is considered a hypertensive emergency.

At this stage it was appropriate for Peter to be managed in primary care and he did not require a tertiary gastroenterology referral at his first presentation. Key“alarm symptoms”and signs are summarised in . The presence of these features increases the probability of an organic disorder， such as inflammatory bowel disease， coeliac disease or other rare gastrointestinal pathologies. Patients with these alarm symptoms require further investigation and consideration of referral. In the 2 months Peter waited for his appointment he developed some of these alarm symptoms. The take home message of this scenario is the recognition of these alarm symptoms.\n\n| Involuntary weight loss  |\n| --- |\n| Linear growth deceleration  |\n| Gastrointestinal blood loss  |\n| Significant vomiting  |\n| (Chronic severe diarrhoea  |\n| Persistent right sided abdominal pain  |\n| Family history of inflammatory bowel disease  |\n| Unexplained fever  |\n\n【31】Table 15.1：“Alarm symptoms\" associated with chronic abdominal pain 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>\n\n【32】The aetiology of chronic abdominal pain in children is multifactorial and poorly understood. The prevalence of this condition is up to 20% in western countries. There are two age peaks， peaking at 4-6years of age and then at 7-12 years of age. Most children with functional abdominal pain have relatively mild symptoms and are managed in primary care. The presence of life stresses or psyco-social difficulties are unhelpful in distinguishing between function and organic pathology通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>.\n\n【33】The mainstay of treatment in children with chronic abdominal pain without “alarm symptoms” is reassurance. This includes family education and encouraging return to normal function rather than complete resolution of symptoms. However， the use of pharmacological treatment， such as analgesia， antispasmodics and probiotics may be used on an individual basis as part of a multifaceted management plan 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>.\n\n【34】In the second question the clinical scenario has progressed. By the time Peter attends the gastroenterology clinic he now has features in keeping with an organic gastrointestinal disorder . The weight loss， persistent worsening abdominal pain， chronic diarrhoea and blood in stool， peri-anal disease， along with systemic upset (pallor， arthralgia) should all be ringing alarm bells. These symptoms suggest an organic disease and further investigation is warranted. There are no nationally agreed absolute first line investigations. However as good practice most clinicians would undertake the following tests； FBC， ESR， CRP， Biochemistry， LFT Coeliac screen， Urine analysis， Stool MC+S and faecal colprotectin.\n\n【35】In this clinical case， inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) should be top of your list of differential diagnoses. Whilst some of his symptoms (e.g. abdominal pain， weight loss and chronic diarrhoea) can feature in other gastrointestinal disorders， such as coeliac disease or bowel malignancy， the presence of blood in stool and peri-anal disease suggests inflammatory bowel disease. His age is also in keeping with the median age of diagnosis being 12 years 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u>.\n\n【36】Gastroesophageal reflux disease/eosophagitis\n\n【37】Table 15.2： Common organic causes of chronic abdominal pain in childhood and adolescence通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u>\n\n【38】The gold standard investigation to diagnose IBD is upper and lower Gl endoscopies with serial mucosal biopsies.\n\n【39】A tissue diagnosis is essential. All the other investigations listed may be helpful but none are diagnostic. NICE now recommends faecal calprotectin testing in a person with suspected IBD. Faecal calprotectin is a substance released into the intestines in excess in the presence of inflammation 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u>. It is a useful test to help doctors distingish between inflammatory bowel diseases and non-inflammatory disorders. CRP and ESR are useful markers of infection and inflammation but neither are specific diagnostic investgiations. Further imaging such as a gadolinium - enhanced MRI， video capsule endoscopy and CT scan may be undertaken but again they do not provide a definite daignosis. A barium meal and follow through allows complete examination of the entire Gl tract， in particular giving complete visualisation of the small bowel which is difficult to see on lower and upper endoscopy.\n\n【40】The final question focuses on the management of inflammatory bowel disease and more specifically Crohn's disease. It requires knowledge of the NICE guidelines 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u>. As with all chronic illnesses， management should be in a multidisciplinary setting overseen by tertiary services. The initial aim of management is to induce remission. NICE recommends that a child with their first presentation or a single inflammatory exacerbation of Crohn’s in a 12 month period should be commenced on conventional glucocorticosteroids as first line monotherapy. Prednisolone， methylprednisolone or intravenous hydrocortisone are generally used. Budesonide may be used in distal ileal， ileocaecal or right-sided colonic disease in whom a conventional glucocorticosteroid is not appropriate. Budesonide is less effective than a conventional glucocorticosteroid but may have fewer side effects 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u>.\n\n【41】In this question the child is experiencing unwanted side effects from the steroids and remission has not yet been achieved. In this situation NICE recommends considering a 6 week exclusive enteral nutrition diet. There are two types of enteral nutrition： elemental (which is unpalatable and generally administered 删除换行1 by NG-tube) and polymeric which is better tolerated orally. Systemic side effects are less than those for steroids but the remission duration is shorter. For a first presentation or a single inflammatory exacerbation in a 12 month period 5-aminosalicylate (5-ASA) can be considered in people who decline， cannot tolerate or in whom glucocorticosteroid treatment is contraindicated. 5-ASA is less effective than a conventional glucocorticosteroid but may have fewer side effects 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u>.\n\n【42】Where adequate control has not been achieved by first line therapy， add on therapy is required. Two or more inflammatory exacerbations in a 12 month period， or where glucocorticosteroid dose cannot be tapered suggests failure to induce adequate remission. The next step in management would be to consider adding azathioprine or mercaptopurine 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u>. Azathioprine is a pro-drug that is metabolised to6-Mercaptopurine.

His general appearance suggests sepsis, and the nuchal rigidity suggests meningitis. These symptoms are caused by cerebral inflammation, ischemia, and edema. Increased intracranial pressure may cause lethargy and even seizures. The most common causative organisms are Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis . Previously, Haemophilus influenzae was the most commonly isolated organism; however, with the advent of the H. influenzae vaccine, this pathogen has been less of a factor. The diagnosis is made by lumbar puncture. Positive findings would be leukocytes (in particular neutrophils) isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and gram-positive organisms. A diffuse erythematous maculopapular rash that becomes petechial is suggestive of meningococcus. Rapid initiation of empiric antibiotic therapy is critical; the medication is aimed at the most common causative organisms and must penetrate through the blood-brain barrier.\n\n【12】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【13】#### Meninges and CSF\n\n【14】### OBJECTIVES\n\n【15】1\\.

The dura mater , a thick fibrous membrane , is the most superficial. Apposed to the deep surface of the dura mater is the arachnoid mater , which is a delicate, thin membrane that is nearly transparent. The pia mater is the thinnest layer, and it is directly apposed to the surface of the brain. Three spaces relate to the three layers. The epidural space lies between the periosteum of the calvaria and the dura mater. Normally, the dura is closely apposed to the bone, so this is a potential space that can be expanded by blood or pus. Similarly, the arachnoid mater is closely apposed to the dura mater. The subdural space between the two layers is also a potential space. The subarachnoid space lies between the arachnoid and pia mater. This space is normally filled with CSF, which is the extracellular fluid of the central nervous system. CSF pooled in the subarachnoid space also serves a protective function by helping to insulate the brain and spinal cord from mechanical shocks.\n\n【27】CSF in the subarachnoid space is produced by the choroid plexus , in the ependyma of the lateral, third, and fourth ventricles. CSF produced in the lateral ventricles flows through the interventricular foramina of Monro into the third ventricle. The cerebral aqueduct of Sylvius then conducts CSF into the fourth ventricle. From there, fluid flows through the foramina of Magendie and Luschka into the subarachnoid space, where it surrounds the brain and spinal cord. The circulatory path ends at the arachnoid granulations, where CSF is resorbed back into the venous system. Most arachnoid granulations are found lining the large venous sinuses, but arachnoid villi may also be present at the roots of spinal nerves.\n\n【28】Meningitis is an inflammation of the meninges , but in practice the term refers to infections of the pia and arachnoid layers , usually involving the CSF 删除33：<u></u>. Infections reach the meninges by several routes. Most infections seem to be transferred through the vasculature (hematogenous transmission). On the arterial side, bacteria can infiltrate through the choroid plexus into the CSF. On the venous side, there are several routes from the face into the cranium. Normally, the veins drain superficially and inferiorly through the pterygoid venous plexus and facial and retromandibular veins. However, there are also anastomoses with the superior and inferior ophthalmic veins. These veins carry blood from the orbit into the cavernous sinus, which is in the middle cranial fossa. Because veins in the face have no valves, some infections can reverse the normal flow of blood so that pathogens are carried into the cavernous sinus. They can then infiltrate through the walls of the sinus into the CSF. A second route is through the nasopharynx. Mucosal infections can track through the cribriform plate into the anterior cranial fossa.\n\n【29】删除3：<u>Figure 35-1.

This patient presents with the classic signs and “symptoms” (night sweats, fever, and weight loss) of Hodgkin lymphoma. The diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of a Reed-Sternberg cell, which is shown in the image and is diagnostic for Hodgkin lymphoma. These cells are large, with lobed nuclei that look like “owl eyes.” Vinblastine is part of the ABVD regimen ( A driamycin \\[doxorubicin\\], B leomycin, V inblastine, and D acarbazine) used to treat Hodgkin lymphoma. It inhibits microtubular formation of the mitotic spindle, so affected cells cannot pass through metaphase. Vinblastine is used to treat both Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas as well as many solid tumors. Adverse effects include alopecia, constipation, myelosuppression, and, rarely, neurotoxicity.  \nAnswer A is incorrect . Cyclosporine is an immunosuppressant used in transplant patients and patients with autoimmune disorders. It works by inhibiting the production and release of IL-2, a cytokine involved in the activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Adverse effects of cyclosporine include GI upset, headache, and tremor. Notably, myelosuppression is not a common adverse effect.  \nAnswer B is incorrect . Hydroxyurea is used to treat sickle cell anemia, and to decrease the burden of high WBC counts in acute leukemia and CML. Hydroxyurea is an antimetabolite, and although its exact mechanism is unknown, it is believed to affect the synthesis (S) phase of the cell cycle. Its major adverse effect is myelosuppression.  \nAnswer C is incorrect . Imatinib is used to treat CML and GI stromal tumors, and would not be helpful in a patient with Hodgkin lymphoma. Patients with CML present with increased neutrophils and metamyelocytes. Imatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that specifically targets the continuously active Bcr-Abl receptor in CML, promoting apoptosis in these cells. Adverse effects include weight gain, GI distress, musculoskeletal pain, and myelosuppression.  \nAnswer D is incorrect . Isoniazid is one of the drugs used to treat tuberculosis (TB), along with rifampin, pyrazinamide, streptomycin, and ethambutol. Night sweats, fever, and weight loss are common in patients with TB; however, the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells in this patient strongly suggests Hodgkin lymphoma. Isoniazid inhibits mycolic acid synthesis, thereby disrupting the Mycoplasma cell wall. Adverse effects include hepatotoxicity, neuropathy, and potentially psychiatric symptoms.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

In more severe cases， patients should be admitted to the hospital and receive intravenous antibiotics.UNCOMPLICATED UTI： An infection of a structurally and functionally normal urinary tract that is generally eradicated by a 3- to 5-day course of antibiotics.UTIs are a common diagnosis in the ED. They can range from simple cystitis to pyelonephritis resulting in sepsis and shock. Urinary tract infections affect women more commonly than men. However， in children， boys are affected more com-monly until 1 year of age. Urinary tract infections in children warrant further sonographic evaluation of the urinary tract to rule out congenital anomalies. The lifetime prevalence of UTIs is estimated to be 14，000 per 100，000 men and 53，000per 100，000 women.Major risk factors for women aged 16 to 35 years include sexual intercourse， preg-nancy， bladder catheterization， and diaphragm usage. Later in life， additional risk factors include gynecologic surgery and bladder prolapse. In both sexes， conditions resulting in urinary stasis increase with age， as does the incidence of UTIs. Benign prostatic hypertrophy is a major risk factor in older men.| Table 53-1·URINALYSIS SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Diagnostic Test  | Sensitivity (%)  | Specificity (%)  |\n| Leu kocyte esterase  | 83 通用删除7(英):<u>(67-94)</u>  | 78通用删除7(英):<u>(64-92)</u>  |\n| Nitrite  | 53通用删除7(英):<u>(15-82)</u>  | 98 通用删除7(英):<u>(90-100)</u>  |\n| LE or N  | 93 通用删除7(英):<u>(90-100)</u>  | 72通用删除7(英):<u>(58-91)</u>  |\n| WBCs  | 73 通用删除7(英):<u>(32-100)</u>  | 81通用删除7(英):<u>(45-98)</u>  |Urinalysis can include urine dipstick testing， urine microscopy， and urine culture with sensitivities. Table 53-1 lists the sensitivity and specificity of different compo-nents of the urinalysis.Urine microscopy It examines the urine for white blood cells， bacteria， and other visible structures. Classically， the criteria for diagnosis of UTI on microscopy include the presence of more than five leukocytes or red blood cells per high-powered field or 2+ bacteria. Microscopic criteria are highly debated and the presence of WBCs， RBCs， and bacteria should be used in conjunction with clinical presentation to con-firm the diagnosis of a UTI.\n\n【6】Urine culture Diagnosis and treatment of a UTI based on the UA result is pre sumptive as the true diagnosis requires a culture with greater than (10×5)/mL colony count. ED urine cultures should be sent on high-risk populations including infants and children. Cultures are also obtained in the elderly， adult men， pregnant women， individuals with comorbid illness， or failing initial antimicrobial therapy. Gram staining of the urine can also be helpful， but is not routinely indicated.The majority of patients with urinary complaints do not require imaging in the ED. However， in certain clinical settings it is indicated. Patients who exhibit clinical signs or symptoms of a urinary infection， but have a negative urinalysis， those with a suspected urogenital obstruction， and complicated UTIs often require imaging studies. In addition， first episodes of UTIs in girls younger than 4 years and men， should undergo an imaging study.The correct choice of antibiotic can be a difficult one for the emergency physician. There are many factors that affect this decision including patient drug allergies， bacterial susceptibility， community versus hospital flora， local antibiotic resistance rates， the presence of medical comorbidities， as well as the patient ability to pay for the prescrip-tion. Table 53-2 lists the most commonly used antibiotics for the treatment of UTIs.\n\n【7】Uncomplicated cystitis patients are treated as outpatients. Antibiotic choices must be effective against E coli and include trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX)， amoxicillin/clavulanate， nitrofurantoin， ciprofloxacin， and levofloxacin. Typically， patients are treated for 3 to 5 days. Longer therapy generally offers no benefit. However， in patients with suspected subclinical upper-tract infection， com-munities with high resistance rates， extremes of age， and comorbidities， a longer course (ie， 7-10 days) is recommended. For symptomatic relief， physicians often pre-scribe phenazopyridine， a drug that concentrates in the urine and often relieves the pain and irritation of urination. The drug causes a distinct color change in the urine； typically to a dark orange to reddish color. Phenazopyridine is contraindicated in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency because it can lead to lrug-induced hemolysis of red blood cells.\n\nUncomplicated pyelonephritis can be treated as an outpatient， provided the patient can tolerate oral medications， has mild symptoms， gets good follow-up， and is not pregnant. TMP-SMX， amoxicillin/clavulanate， or a fluoroquinolone antibiotic should be prescribed for 10 to 14 days. All pregnant patients with pyelonephritis require admission 删除25：<u></u>.| Table 53-2· UTI TYPES AND TREATMENT CHOICES  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Infection Type  | Dosing Regimen  | Considerations  |\n| Lower， uncomplicated  | TMP-SMX DS 1 tab bid for 3-5 d Ciprofloxacin 250 mg bid for 3-5 d Nitrofurantoin sustained-release 100 mg bidfor 3-5 days Amoxicillin/clavulanate 875/125 mg bid for 3-5 d  | No culture indicatedTailor to community susceptibilities  |\n| Upper uncomplicatedor complicated lower  | Ciprofloxacin 500 mg bid for 7-14 d Nitrofurantoin sustained-release 100 mg bidfor 7-14 d Amoxicillin/clavulanate 875/125 mg bid for7-14d  | Cu tures recommended Admit if severe  || Table 53-3oADMISSION CRITERIA FOR PYELONEPHRITIS  |\n| --- |\n| Sepsis/shock (consider intensive care setting) Inability to tolerate oral antibiotics Obstruction of the UG Tract Pregnant Extremes of age Failed outpatient management Immunocompromised host Inadequate follow-up/poor social setting  |Some patients require chronic placement of indwelling catheters， which serve as a nidus for infection.

She has had this pain off and on for several years; however, for the past 2 days it is worse than it has ever been. It started after she vigorously vacuumed a rug, is primarily on the right lower side, radiates down her posterior right thigh to her knee, but is not associated with any numbness or tingling. It is relieved by laying flat on her back with her legs slightly elevated and lessened somewhat when she takes ibuprofen 400 mg. Except for moderate obesity and difficulty maneuvering onto the examination table because of pain, her examination is fairly normal. The only abnormalities you note are a positive straight leg raise test, with raising the right leg eliciting more pain than the left. Her strength, sensation, and deep tendon reflexes in all extremities are normal.\n\n【3】 What is your diagnosis?\n\n【4】 What is your next step?\n\n【5】### ANSWERS TO CASE 24:\n\n【6】#### Low Back Pain\n\n【7】Summary: An obese 35-year-old woman with acute worsening of chronic low back pain complains of shooting pain down her right leg. Her physical examination is normal.\n\n【8】 Most likely diagnosis: Musculoskeletal low back pain, possible sciatica without neurologic deficits.\n\n【9】 Next step: Encourage continuation of usual activity, avoiding twisting motions or heavy lifting. Use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on a scheduled basis; you can also recommend muscle relaxants, although these drugs may cause sleepiness. Massage or physical therapy might be helpful. Follow-up in 4 weeks. Long-term advice includes weight loss and back-strengthening exercises.\n\n【10】#### ANALYSIS\n\n【11】##### Objectives\n\n【12】1\\. Learn the history and physical examination findings that help to distinguish benign musculoskeletal low back pain from more serious causes of low back pain.\n\n【13】2\\. Understand the variety of treatment options and their effectiveness in low back pain.\n\n【14】3\\. Learn the judicious use of laboratory and imaging tests in evaluating low back pain.\n\n【15】##### Considerations\n\n【16】This young patient with chronic back pain has an acute exacerbation with pain radiating down her leg, which may indicate possible sciatic nerve compression. She has no other neurologic abnormalities, such as sensory deficits, motor weakness, or “red flag” symptoms of more serious etiologies of back pain, which if present would demand a more urgent evaluation. Thus, this individual has a good prognosis for recovery with conservative therapy, perhaps time being the most important factor. If she does not improve after 6 weeks, then imaging studies can be considered.\n\n【17】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【18】#### Low Back Pain\n\n【19】#### DEFINITIONS\n\n【20】CAUDA EQUINA SYNDROME: Lower back pain, saddle anesthesia, and bowel or bladder dysfunction with possible lower extremity weakness and loss of reflexes caused by compression of multiple sacral nerve roots. Cauda equina syndrome is a surgical emergency.\n\n【21】SCIATICA: Pain in the distribution of the lumbar or sacral nerve roots, with or without motor or sensory deficits.\n\n【22】SPONDYLOLISTHESIS: Anterior displacement of an upper vertebral body on the lower body, which can cause symptoms and signs of spinal stenosis. This condition can result from spondylolysis or from degenerative disk disease in the elderly.\n\n【23】SPONDYLOLYSIS: Defect in the pars interarticularis, either congenital or secondary to a stress fracture, leading to lower back pain, back muscle spasms, or no symptoms.\n\n【24】#### CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【25】Low back pain is experienced by two-thirds of all adults at some point in their lives. Approximately 2% of adults miss work each year because of low back pain. This complaint is most common in adults in their working years, usually affecting patients between 30 and 60 years of age. Although it is common in workers required to perform lifting and twisting, it is also a common complaint in those who sit or stand for prolonged periods. Low back pain is a recurrent disease that tends to be mild in younger patients, often resolving within 2 weeks, but can be more severe and prolonged as the patient ages. It is one of the most common reasons for young adults to seek medical care, second only to upper respiratory infections, and millions of healthcare dollars are expended on this problem each year. In evaluating patients with low back pain, the clinician needs to exclude potentially serious conditions, such as malignancy, infection , and dangerous neurologic processes, such as spinal cord compression or cauda equina syndrome . Individuals without these conditions are initially managed with conservative therapy. Nearly all patients recover spontaneously within 4 to 6 weeks; only 3% to 5% remain disabled for more than 3 months. If patients do not improve within 4 weeks with conservative management, they should undergo further evaluation to rule out systemic or rheumatic disease and to clarify the anatomic cause, especially patients with localized pain, nocturnal pain, or sciatica.\n\n【26】The potential causes of back pain are numerous . Pain can emanate from the bones, ligaments, muscles, or nerves. Rarely, it can be a result of referred pain from a visceral organ or other structure. Back pain with radiation down the back of the leg suggests sciatic nerve root compression , generally caused by a herniated intervertebral disk at the L4-L5 or L5-S1 level. Patients typically report aching pain in the buttock and paresthesias radiating into the posterior thigh and calf or lateral foreleg. When pain radiates below the knee, it is more likely to indicate a true radiculopathy than radiation only to the posterior thigh. A history of persistent leg numbness or weakness further increases the likelihood of neurologic involvement.\n删除4：<u>Table 24–1 • ETIOLOGIES OF LOW BACK PAIN</u>\n\n【27】Most cases of back pain are idiopathic, and this group, in general, is referred to as musculoskeletal low back pain. Imaging studies and other diagnostic tests are generally not helpful in managing these cases. Studies show that the history and physical examination can help separate the majority of patients with simple and self-limited musculoskeletal back pain from the minority with more serious underlying causes. Finding “red flag” symptoms can help the physician use diagnostic tests in a more judicious manner . Malignancy should be considered in patients with systemic symptoms and who have pain at night or pain that is not relieved by lying in a supine position. Primary cancers that commonly metastasize to the spine include lung, breast, prostate, lymphoma, and gastrointestinal (GI) tumors and melanoma . Multiple myeloma is a plasma cell neoplasm that can present with bone pain, renal failure, and anemia . When the patient has worrisome symptoms or signs, in most cases, the most effective initial evaluation is plain anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the involved area of the spine, a sedimentation rate, and a complete blood count. More expensive tests, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), should be reserved for those patients for whom surgery is being considered, because it is not required to make most diagnoses.\n删除4：<u>Table 24–2 “RED FLAG” SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF LOW BACK PAIN</u>\n\n【28】New onset of pain in a patient older than 50 y or younger than 20 y\n\n【29】Fever\n\n【30】Unintentional weight loss\n\n【31】Severe nighttime pain or pain that is worse in the supine position\n\n【32】Bowel or bladder incontinence\n\n【33】History of cancer\n\n【34】Immunosuppression (chemotherapy or HIV)\n\n【35】Saddle anesthesia\n\n【36】Major motor weakness\n\n【37】It is rare that the patient can recall a precipitating event. Patients often have a history of recurrent episodes of low back pain. Psychological causes have not been consistently related to low back pain; however, there does seem to be an association with job satisfaction. During the physical examination, palpable point tenderness over the spinous processes may indicate a destructive lesion of the spine itself; in contrast, those with musculoskeletal back pain most often have tenderness in the muscular paraspinal area. Strength, sensation, and reflexes should be assessed, especially in those with complaints of radicular or radiating pain. Straight leg raise testing , in which the examiner holds the patient’s ankle and passively elevates the patient’s leg to 45°, is helpful if it elicits pain in the lower back suggesting nerve root compression. However, it is not a very sensitive or specific test . The Patrick maneuver, in which the patient externally rotates the hip, flexes the knee, and crosses the knee of the other leg with the ankle (like a number 4) while the examiner simultaneously presses down on the flexed knee and the opposite side of the pelvis, can help distinguish pain emanating from the sacroiliac joint.\n\n【38】In treating idiopathic low back pain, various modalities have been shown to be equally effective in the long run. Randomized, controlled trials have shown that encouraging the patient to continue his or her usual activity is superior to recommendations for bed rest . Patients without disability and without evidence of nerve root compression probably can maintain judicious activity rather than undergoing bed rest. Bed rest probably is appropriate only for individuals with severe pain or neurologic deficits. The patient should be instructed to position himself or herself so as to minimize pain; this usually consists of lying supine with the upper body slightly elevated and a pillow under the knees. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (on a scheduled rather than on an as-needed basis), nonaspirin analgesics, and muscle relaxants may help in the acute phase. Because most cases of disk herniation with radiculopathy resolve spontaneously within 4 to 6 weeks without surgery, these conservative measures are initial regimen recommended for these patients as well. Narcotic analgesics are also an option in cases of severe pain; however, because idiopathic low back pain is often a chronic problem, their prolonged use beyond the initial phase is discouraged. Chiropractic therapy, physical therapy, massage therapy, and acupuncture have been studied (in trials of varying quality), with results comparable to traditional approaches. Referral to a surgeon may be considered for those patients with radicular pain with or without neuropathy that does not resolve with 4 to 6 weeks of conservative management .\n\n【39】Patients with concerning clinical features, such as a history of malignancy, fever, or examination findings suggestive of spinal cord compression or cauda equina syndrome, should be referred for urgent imaging, either MRI or CT of the spine, to evaluate for conditions such as vertebral metastases, vertebral osteomyelitis, or spinal epidural abscess that require urgent treatment.\n\n【40】###", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The major arterial supply to the head of the femur is the medial and lateral circumflex femoral arteries (branches of the deep femoral artery) and the artery of the ligament of the head of the femur (branch of the obturator artery). The circumflex arteries may be disrupted by a fracture of the femoral neck， leaving only the artery of the ligament (a branch of the obturator) as a supply. Disruption of the blood supply may cause avascular necrosis of the femoral head.\n\n【7】What bones form the hip joint?\n\n【8】The hip joint consists of the head of the femur articulating with the acetabulum. The acetabulum is formed by the ilium， ischium， and pubis. The fibrocartilaginous rim， the acetabular labrum， attaches to the acetabular margin and deepens the acetabular cup.\n\n【9】Six weeks later， repeat x-ray shows a callus. What does the callus indicate about the patient's stage of healing?\n\n【10】Bone healing is often divided into three stages：\n\n【11】· Inflammatory phase： A hematoma forms at the site of fracture to help deliver the building blocks of new bone formation. Reabsorption occurs at the edges of bone， which is why fractures are more likely to be seen on x-ray several days after the injury.\n\n【12】Reparative phase： New blood vessels that supply nutrients to the cartilage begin to form at the fracture site， followed by callus formation. The osteoprogenitor cells that form the callus derive from the inner surface of the periosteum， not from the marrow or the epiphyseal plate. The patient is in this stage of healing.\n\n【13】Remodeling phase： The endochondral callus becomes ossified and bone undergoes structural remodelling (a process that is much slower in elders than in children).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Open fractures occur in approximately 2 per cent of cases.\n\n【12】The ankle is often thought of as a simple hinge joint, although biomechanically the axis  删除换行1 of rotation is constantly changing as the ankle allows variable degrees of rotation and  删除换行1 translation in the coronal and axial planes as well as the sagittal plane.\n\n【13】The ankle joint is formed by contributions from the tibia, fibula and talus. When the foot  删除换行1 is dorsiflexed, the widened anterior portion of the talus fits securely within the medial  删除换行1 and lateral malleoli and the talocrural joint acts as a true mortise with the bony structures  删除换行1 providing the majority of the stability.

Her quantitative hCG level is above the threshold of 1200 to 1500 mIU/mL， and no intrauterine pregnancy is seen on transvaginal sonography； thus， her risk for an ectopic preg-nancy approaches 85%. Other diagnoses should be considered， such as threatened abortion， incomplete abortion， pelvic inflammatory disease， or appendicitis. Ectopic pregnancy is defined as a pregnancy that develops after implantation of the blasto-cyst anywhere other than in the lining of the uterine cavity.\n\n【18】APPROACH TO：\n\n【19】Ectopic Pregnancy\n\n【20】DEFINITIONS\n\n【21】ECTOPIC PREGNANCY： Pregnancy that develops after implantation anywhere other than the lining of the uterus.\n\n【22】RUPTURED ECTOPIC PREGNANCY： Ectopic pregnancy that has eroded through the tissue in which it has implanted， producing hemorrhage from exposed vessels.\n\n【23】SALPINGECTOMY： Surgical excision and removal of the oviduct and ectopic pregnancy.\n\n【24】SALPINGOSTOMY： Surgical excision of the ectopic pregnancy with preservation of the tube. The tube remains opened to heal by secondary intention.\n\n【25】CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【26】Ectopic pregnancy is defined as a pregnancy outside the lining of the uterus， most commonly occurring in the oviduct， but it may also be found in the abdo-men， ovary， or cervix. The incidence of the ectopic pregnancy has increased in the United States for three reasons： 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> the increased incidence of salpingitis caused by increased infection with Chlamydia trachomatis or other sexually transmitted dis-eases， 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> improved diagnostic techniques，and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> the increase in assisted reproduc-tive technology pregnancies. Other risk factors include prior tubal surgery， previous ectopic pregnancy， use of exogenous progesterone， and a history of infertility agents. The most common presenting symptoms are abdominal pain， absence of menses， and irregular vaginal bleeding. Other symptoms found on physical examination may include a palpable adnexal tenderness， uterine enlargement， tachycardia， hypoten-sion， syncope， peritoneal signs， and fever.\n\n【27】Approximately half of the episodes of ectopic pregnancy are linked to previ-ous salpingitis， although these episodes may be asymptomatic. Prior infections are likely to lead to anatomic tubal pathology that prevents the normal passage of an embryo into the uterus. In the remaining incidences of ectopic pregnancy， an identifying factor cannot be determined and may be linked to a physiologic disor-der. Increased levels of estrogen and progesterone interfere with tubal motility and increase the chance of ectopic pregnancy.\n\n【28】Approximately 97% of ectopic pregnancies occur in the oviduct， specifically in the ampullary region. The remainder of ectopic pregnancies implant in the abdo-men， cervix， or ovary. Pathogenesis of ectopic pregnancy begins as the embryo invades the lumen of the tube and its peritoneal covering. As the embryo contin-ues to grow， surrounding vessels may bleed into the peritoneal cavity， resulting in a hemoperitoneum. The stretching of the tube results in abdominal pain until necro-sis ensues and results in rupture of the ectopic pregnancy.\n\n【29】The differential diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy includes many other gyneco-logic and surgical illnesses. Most common are salpingitis， threatened or incomplete 删除换行1 abortion， ruptured corpus luteum， adnexal torsion， and appendicitis. The diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy must be considered in any woman of reproductive age with abnormal vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain.\n\n【30】Diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy may be aided with the use of transvaginal ultra-sound. Visualization of the pelvic organs may reveal the absence of an intrauterine pregnancy， the presence of a complex adnexal mass， or the presence of an embryo in the adnexa. It is important to note that with higher resolution ultrasound， the hCG discriminatory zone is closer to 1200 to 1500 mIU/mL than the traditionally quoted figure of 1500 to 2000 mIU/mL， in which an intrauterine pregnancy is almost always seen on transvaginal sonography. Lack of visualization of an intra-uterine gestational sac on transvaginal sonography confers up to an 85% risk of an ectopic pregnancy. At times， sonography can visualize an ectopic pregnancy even with hCG levels lower than this threshold； the level of hCG does not reliably cor-relate with the size of the ectopic pregnancy. When hCG levels are lower than the above threshold， the ED physician should rely on the clinical impression to diagnose an ectopic pregnancy.\n\n【31】In a reliable and asymptomatic patient whose initial hCG level is below the threshold， a repeat hCG level can be obtained in 48 hours. The hCG should increase by at least 66% over 48 hours； lack of normal rise strongly implies an abnormal pregnancy， although the test does not indicate the location of the preg-nancy (ectopic or miscarriage). A definitive diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy can most always be made by direct visualization of the pelvic organs using laparoscopy if the diagnosis remains uncertain.\n\n【32】More pregnancies are associated with in vitro fertilization， which carries a higher risk of ectopic pregnancy， and multiple gestation. Notably， in women who have IVF pregnancies， a proven intrauterine pregnancy may not rule out ectopic pregnancy， since these patients can have heterotopic pregnancies (concomitant intrauterine and ectopic pregnancies).\n\n【33】Treatment options include both medical and surgical therapy. Medical treat-ment consists of using intramuscular methotrexate， a folinic acid antagonist that interferes with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis，repair， and cellular replica-tion. Actively dividing tissue， such as fetal cell growth is susceptible to methotrex-ate and may be used for treatment of ectopic pregnancy under specific conditions删除33：<u></u>. Methotrexate is found to be more successful if the hCG is less than5000 mIU/mL， if the fetus is smaller than 3.5 cm， and if there is no detectable fetal cardiac activity. It is important to note that each individual patient may present with different complaints and different levels of hCG， and at times medical man-agement involves multiple doses of methotrexate.\n\n【34】Potential problems associated with medical management of ectopic pregnancy include drug side effects and treatment failure. Some patients treated with meth-otrexate will develop acute abdominal pain due to the process of “tubal abor-tion.” In these individuals， pelvic sonography is useful- if the vital signs are stable， and the ultrasound does not show much intra-abdominal fluid， the patient may be observed in the hospital to assess for resolution of the pain.

Two hundred women, including those who suffer from alcoholism and those who do not, are recruited into the study when they present for their first primary care visit. A medical history is taken on alcohol use, prenatal care, nutritional status, and smoking behaviors; these are measured monthly during the pregnancy. The researchers follow the women’s pregnancies until term, after which they devote their attention to the health and behaviors of the offspring. Which of the following is the most appropriate statistic the researchers will be able to calculate as a result of their study?\n\n【1】> (A) Attributable risk of offspring abnormalities in mothers who smoke\n\n【2】> (B) Odds ratio of offspring abnormalities in mothers who consume alcohol during pregnancy\n\n【3】> (C) Prevalence of alcohol consumption during pregnancy\n\n【4】> (D) Proportion of all offspring abnormalities that are due to alcohol consumption during pregnancy\n\n【5】> (E) Relative risk of offspring abnormalities in mothers who consume alcohol during pregnancy\n\n【6】 Answer: The correct answer is E. The study described here is a cohort study, because it includes a group with and a group without a given risk factor (fetal exposure to alcohol) and then looks at whether the risk factor changes the chances of offspring getting the disease (abnormalities). The study is prospective, because the group members are looked at before the disease (abnormality) develops in the offspring. Relative risk can be calculated from the results of a cohort study by comparing the rate of disease in the group with the risk factor to the rate of disease in the group without the risk factor.  \nAnswer A is incorrect. Attributable risk can be calculated from the results of a cohort study and describes the proportion of disease that is due to the risk factor under study. Although smoking behavior of the women is being recorded, the study is not designed to look at the impact of this risk factor on fetal abnormality; the rate of smoking in the two groups of women is unknown, and thus we do not know whether there are sufficient numbers of women in the “exposed” and “unexposed” groups when it comes to tobacco.  \nAnswer B is incorrect. An odds ratio is similar to relative risk, but it is calculated from the results of a case-control study, not from a cohort study. Because birth abnormality is a relatively rare outcome, the odds ratio from a case-control study would likely closely approximate the actual relative risk.  \nAnswer C is incorrect. Prevalence is a measure of how many cases of a given disease exist in a population that is at risk for that disease. This is not the best answer in this case, because there are no data to judge whether this group of 200 women represents the true prevalence of alcoholism during pregnancy in the community.  \nAnswer D is incorrect. The statistic described in this answer is the population attributable risk (PAR), which helps us understand, in a given population, how much less common a disease (fetal abnormality) would be if a given risk factor (alcohol consumption during pregnancy) were completely eliminated. To calculate PAR, the attributable risk is multiplied by the prevalence of the risk factor in the population, which would not be known in this study.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

This is associated with sore throat, mouth and lips, and red  删除换行1 eyes. He also complains of fever and malaise preceding the onset of the skin lesions. He is  删除换行1 fit, with no previous history of any skin disorder or allergy. Seven days earlier he twisted  删除换行1 his ankle while playing football and had taken paracetamol and ibuprofen for a few days.\n\n【3】Examination\n\n【4】This young man looks unwell. He has conjunctival injection bilaterally. There are multiple irregular erosions in the mouth and on the lips that are tender with haemorrhagic  删除换行1 crusting. There are widespread erythematous lesions over all four limbs. Observations:  删除换行1 temperature 37.9°C, heart rate 120/min, blood pressure 80/50 mmHg, respiratory rate  删除换行1 24/min, SaO2 99 per cent on room air.\n\n【5】INVESTIGATIONS\n\n【6】 Normal range\n\n【7】Arterial blood gas on room air:  删除换行1 pH 7.37 7.35–7.45\n\n【8】PO2 12 9.3–13.3 kPa\n\n【9】PCO2 3.9 4.7–6.0 kPa\n\n【10】Lactate 4.3 <2 mmol/L\n\n【11】HCO3 22 22–26 mmol/L\n\n【12】Base excess -3 -3 to +3 mmol/L\n\n【13】Questions\n\n【14】• What are the differential diagnoses?\n\n【15】• How would you manage this young man?\nANSWER 95The presence of extensive target-like lesions is highly suggestive of erythema multiforme  删除换行1 major (EM major) or Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS). Some authorities suggest that EM,  删除换行5 SJS and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have similar pathophysiological processes and  删除换行1 differ only in the extent of dermatological and mucosal involvement. One classification  删除换行1 suggests that EM minor is skin lesions without mucosal involvement. EM major or SJS  删除换行5 is a more severe form of EM minor involving mucosal lesions. The extent of skin lesion  删除换行1 in SJS is usually less than 10 per cent of the body surface area. TEN is a severe form of  删除换行5 SJS where over 30 per cent body surface area is affected. In TEN, the dermis separates  删除换行1 from the epidermis, causing extensive erosion and blisters (leading to a positive Nikolsky  删除换行1 sign). The oral, conjunctival, respiratory, gastrointestinal and urogenital mucosae are also  删除换行1 involved, leading to lip adhesion, corneal erosions, respiratory failure, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, urinary retention, sepsis and multi-organ failure. Scoring systems such as \n\n【16】SCORTEN are available to predict TEN prognosis. Clinically it may be difficult to separate \n\n【17】TEN and SJS as it may overlap.\n\n【18】Fifty per cent of cases of EM minor are idiopathic, and if an identifiable cause is found  删除换行1 then it is due to one of the following categories: infection (e.g. herpes simplex, human  删除换行1 immunodeficiency virus, mycoplasma, group A Streptococcus, malaria), a connective  删除换行1 tissue disorder (e.g. systemic lupus erythematosus, vasculitides), malignancy (e.g. lymphoma) or drug-related (e.g. vaccination, antibiotic, anticonvulsant, non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug). The causes of SJS and TEN are the same as for EM minor, although  删除换行1 drugs are more likely to be implicated. The time between drug exposure and symptoms  删除换行1 can vary between 4 and 28 days.\n\n【19】This patient is tachycardic and hypotensive. He needs prompt treatment with intravenous fluids. He may require antibiotics for a superadded bacterial infection from his skin  删除换行1 lesions. If there is an on-call dermatologist available, he/she should be notified about the  删除换行1 patient as soon as possible. These patients often become very unwell and require treatment in a high-dependency unit. You should notify the team there if the patient’s blood  删除换行1 pressure and heart rate do not improve after fluid resuscitation.\nIn EM minor, the rash settles in 2–3 weeks and the treatment is conservative. In SJS  删除换行5 and TEN, the use of systemic steroids and intravenous immunoglobulin G are well documented in the literature but the results remain controversial. Supportive care in intensive  删除换行1 care or a specialist unit is fundamental to the management of this condition. The general  删除换行1 management is similar to that of erythroderma with special attention to good oral, skin  删除换行1 and eye care. Instigate cardiorespiratory support as appropriate. Provide nutritional supplementation. Identification and prompt treatment of complications such as sepsis, good  删除换行1 body temperature control and symptomatic relief are all important aspects of management of SJS and TEN. Stop all offending drugs and minimize unnecessary prescriptions.\n\n【20】With any severe adverse reaction to a drug (or any adverse reaction to a new drug) it is  删除换行1 important to report the matter to the Medicines and Healthcare Products Agency (MHPA) 删除换行1 through the yellow card scheme.\nKEY POINTS\n\n【21】• The presence of target-like lesions in the context of a drug reaction is highly suggestive  删除换行1 of erythema multiforme.\n\n【22】• As with erythroderma, it is important to recognize that this condition is a  删除换行1 dermatological emergency that needs to be treated promptly.\n\n【23】• Withdraw all implicated drug therapy as soon as possible.删除6：<u>This page intentionally left blank 263</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The temperature at which the DNA strands separate is dependent on the number of hydrogen bonds that make up the base pairing. Because G-C pairs have three hydrogen bonds while A-T pairs only have 2, then the strand that has the greatest number of G-C pairs will have the higher melting temperature, Tm, which is the temperature at which one-half of the base pairs are broken. Interestingly, the TATA box, the starting point of transcription in eukaryotes, has weaker bonding.\n\n【12】Question: 6.2 Restriction enzymes are used to cleave genomic DNA into smaller fragments.

A–A–C–C–A–A\n\n【16】D. G–T–G–T–G–T\n\n【17】E. A–A–A–C–C–C\n\n【18】Answer: 6.2 B. Most of the sequences recognized by restriction endonucleases are palindromes; that is, they have the same nucleotide sequence on both strands when read in the 5′ to 3′ direction. Because answer B has the only sequence that will be a palindrome when paired with its complementary strand, it is the most likely to be a site recognized by a restriction endonuclease (it is the site recognized by the restriction endonuclease Pst 1).\n\n【19】Question: 6.3 A 21-year-old woman was abducted when she went to the local convenience store. Her body was found the next morning in a wooded area behind the store. The autopsy revealed that she had been sexually assaulted and strangled. Crime scene investigators were able to collect a semen sample from vaginal fluid as well as tissue samples from underneath the victim’s fingernails. DNA samples were obtained from three suspects besides the victim. A variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) analysis was performed on the DNA samples from the evidence collected, the victim, and the suspect, and the results were compared. Which of the following techniques is the most appropriately applied for this analysis?\n\n【20】A. Allele-specific oligonucleotide probes\n\n【21】B. DNA sequencing\n\n【22】C. Northern blot\n\n【23】D. Southern blot\n\n【24】E. Western blot\n\n【25】Answer: 6.3 D. A VNTR analysis examines the hypervariable regions of the human genome. These contain sequences that are repeated in tandem a variable number of times and the length is unique for each individual. Because it is DNA fragments that are being analyzed, the Southern blot is the most appropriate technique to use to separate and detect these regions. DNA sequencing is too time consuming to be practical for forensic analyses. The Northern blot is used to separate and detect RNA, whereas the Western blot is used for proteins. Allele-specific oligonucleotide probes are used when testing for the presence of a genetic mutation that either introduces or removes a restriction site.\n\n【26】Question: 6.4 A 40-year-old man presents to his primary care physician due to a painful lesion on his scrotum. On examination, the physician observed what appeared to be herpetic vesicles on the left underside of the scrotum. He prescribed a course of valacyclovir. Valacyclovir treats outbreaks of HSV infection by which of the following?\n\n【27】A. Acting as a protease inhibitor\n\n【28】B. Inhibiting protein translation\n\n【29】C. Inhibiting reverse transcriptase\n\n【30】D. Inhibiting packaging of new viral particles\n\n【31】E. Inhibiting replication of the viral genome\nAnswer: 6.4 E.

It typically affects infants and toddlers, and causes systemic vasculitis. The most common pathologic findings include systemic vasculitis and a high incidence of inflammatory lesions affecting various organs, such as liver, kidney, lungs, and nervous system. More and more attentions had been paid to KD complicated with kidney injury in recent years. The involvement of the genitourinary tract in KD manifests itself clinically in various forms. The most common presentations are sterile pyuria and proteinuria; fewer patients have transient microscopic hematuria. Although they are rare, severe complications such as renovascular hypertension, hemolytic uremic syndrome, interstitial nephritis, and acute renal failure have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>.\n2.  2.\n    Histological findings included a normal glomerulus or mild expansion of the mesangial matrix; interstitial infiltration of lymphocytes, plasmocytes, and eosinophils; and a focus of tubular necrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. There are also a few literatures suggesting that KD may affect renal parenchyma. Renal scar formation was found about half a year after KD diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n3.  3.\n    In this case, when the patient was diagnosed with KD at first time, urine routine test indicated urinary protein (+), RBC 7.0/HP, WBC 11.03/HP. The second time he was diagnosed with KD, urine routine test showed that protein level was increased (+++), RBC 491.35/HP, and WBC 10.4/HP. Urologic ultrasonography revealed diffuse injury on both kidneys, but with normal Cr and BUN. RBC malformation rate was 70% indicating RBC coming from glomerular. After IVIG treatment, urine protein was regressed to (+), RBC was reduced to 26.75/HP, WBC was normal. In addition, urine β <sub>2 </sub> micro-globulin was slightly increased, which suggest impaired renal tubular function. The increased urine transferrin suggested impaired renal glomerular function, too. But, normal Cr and BUN implied there were no severe renal function damages. Furthermore, kidney ultrasound showed they were recovered to normal, and urine β <sub>2 </sub> micro-globulin was recovered, which suggested that the impaired renal tubular function may be transient and reversible. Further increased urinary transferrin suggested unrecovered glomerular function. Normal GRF but slow excretion indicated the injury was there for some time. This may be the reason to keep hematuria, and requires dynamic follow-up.\n4.  4.\n    To determine the causes of hematuria proteinuria whether by KD-related vasculitis or by other immune-related diseases prior to KD, we test ANCA and antinuclear antibody serial examinations, but we did not find abnormalities. His parents refused to give consent on further tests including immunodeficiency screening, abdominal CT, lipid, scleral ciliary body, and nephrodialysis.\n5.  5.\n    This was the first time for us to see KD children with both hematuria and proteinuria diagnosed in our center. With the improvement of the disease, the urine routine test results returned to normal at his first time KD, which was consistent with the literature reports. After the recurrence of KD, obvious hematuria and proteinuria were found in the acute phase, and the 24-h urine protein quantification reached the nephropathy standard. Although the urine routine was slightly improved at convalescence period at 2 months of illness, his conditions met the guideline standard for stopping all drugs. The urine routine was still abnormal. The long-term prognosis for this patient is unknown because we have not been given a chance to follow up with him.\n\n【26】Xue-mei Li", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The third-degree AV block， or complete heart block， refers to a lack of AV conduction， and lack of conduction of all atrial impulses (P waves) to the ven-tricles， as seen in this patient’s ECG. Mobitz type II second-degree heart block is characterized by a regularly dropped beat without progressive prolongation of the PR interval and is associated with evidence of additional disease in the conduction system， such as BBB or bifascicular or trifascicular block. Mobitz type II heart block suddenly progresses to complete heart block and is usually treated with a pacemaker.\n\n【12】15.2 C. A pacemaker is indicated in patients who have acquired third-degree AV block. Many patients with complete heart block are symptomatic and are treated with a pacemaker.

This patient has developed nasopharyngeal carcinoma, a condition common in certain parts of the world, including Asia and Africa. Development of this tumor is always associated with infection by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a DNA virus in the herpesvirus family. Development of this tumor is believed to be related to a synergistic interaction between EBV and a diet high in carcinogenic nitrosamines (common in foods that has been smoked or preserved). Common symptoms include nasal congestion, epistaxis, ear infections (due to tumor-induced blockage of the eustachian tubes), and headache.  \nAnswer B is incorrect. Many bacteria are capable of infecting the nasopharynx; however, none are directly associated with malignancy.  \nAnswer C is incorrect. Nasopharyngeal zygomycosis is a condition that could present with these symptoms in an immunocompromised patient. However, biopsy would show filamentous nonseptate hyphae and a granulomatous response.  \nAnswer D is incorrect. Although a tuberculoma in the nasopharynx can be confused with a nasopharyngeal tumor, biopsy would show caseating granulomas with multinucleated giant cells.  \nAnswer E is incorrect.

The image shows gram-positive cocci in clusters. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) is caused by the release of two exotoxins (epidermolytic toxins A and B) from Staphylococcus aureus . Desmosomes (also called “macula adherens”) are responsible for binding epithelial cells to one another to form a coherent whole. The exotoxins that are released bind to a molecule within the desmosome called desmoglein 1, thereby disrupting cell adhesion. In SSSS, the epidermis separates at the stratum granulosum due to the binding of exotoxins to desmosomes in this layer. Clinically, this results in bullous lesions and a positive Nikolsky sign.  \nAnswer B is incorrect. Gap junctions are circular intercellular contact areas that permit the passage of small molecules between adjacent cells, allowing communication to facilitate electrotonic and metabolic function.  \nAnswer C is incorrect. Hemidesmosomes are present on the basal surface of epithelial cells adjacent to the basement membrane, and serve to connect epithelial cells to the underlying extracellular matrix.  \nAnswer D is incorrect. Intermediate junctions lie deep to tight junctions, comprised of actin filaments forming a continuous band around the cell, providing structural support just below tight junctions.  \nAnswer E is incorrect.

Explain.\n\n【8】删除6：<u>This page intentionally left blank to match pagination of print book</u>\n\n【9】Answers: Answer 1\n\n【10】During inspiration， the negative pressure on the airways causes their diameter to increase， allowing an inflow of air. During expiration， the positive expiratory pres-sure tends to narrow the airways. This narrowing is exaggerated when the airway is inflamedand bronchial smooth muscle is constricted，as in asthma. This causes air to be trapped in the lungs， with an increase in residual lung volume at the end ofexpira-tion. Breathing at high residual lung volume means more work for the muscles and increased expenditure ofenergy； this results in the sensation of tightness in the chest. The high residual lung volume is also the cause of the hyperinflated chest observed on the chest radiograph. The peribronchial inflammation in asthma causes bronchial marking around the airways.\n\n【11】Answer 2\n\n【12】Chronic allergic asthma is not simply due to constriction of the smooth muscles that surround the airway： it is largely due to the inflammatory reaction in the air-way， which consists of cellular infiltration， increased secretion of mucus， and swell-ing of the bronchial tissues. This explains the failure of bronchodilators， which dilate smooth muscles， to maintain an open airway and their failure to completely reverse the decreased air flow during Frank's acute attacks. Steroids are therefore given to combat the inflammatory reaction of the late-phase response.\n\n【13】Answer 3\n\n【14】Allergic individuals have a tendency to respond to allergens with an immune response skewed to the production of TH2 cells rather than THl. The cells produce the interleukins IL-4 and IL-13， cytokines that induce IgE production in humans. TH2 cells also make IL-5， which is essential for eosinophil maturation. Furthermore， activated T cells and bronchial epithelial cells secrete CCLll (formerly known as eotaxin)， which attracts eosinophils in the airways. The production of IL-4 and IL-5by TH2 cells responding to allergens in atopic individuals explains the frequent asso-ciation of IgE antibody response and eosinophilia in these patients.\n\n【15】Answer 4\n\n【16】IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to an allergen is tested for by injecting a small amount ofthe allergen intradermally. In allergic individuals， this is followed within 10-20 min-utes by a wheal-and-flare reaction at the site of injection 删除33：<u></u>， which sub-sides within an hour. The wheal-and-flare reaction is due mainly to the release of histamine by mast cells in the skin. This increases the permeability of blood vessels and the leakage of their contents into the tissues， resulting in the swollen wheal； dila-tion of the fine blood vessels around the area produces the diffuse red ‘flare’seen around the wheal. This reaction is almost completely inhibited by antagonists of the histamine type l receptor， the major histamine receptor expressed in the skin.\n\n【17】Answer 5\n\n【18】The recurrence of the redness and swelling at the site of previous immediate allergic reactions represents the late-phase response characterized by a cellular infiltrate.\n\n【19】Answer 6\n\n【20】Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin and ibuprofen can induce wheezing in certain patients. This is classically seen in patients with Sampter's triad： asthma， nasal polyps， and NSAID sensitivity. NSAIDs inhibit the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX). Normally， the actions of COX lead to the synthesis of prostaglandins from arachidonic acid. COX inhibition leads to shunting of the arachidonic acid precursor away from prostaglandin synthesis and into the leu-kotriene synthesis pathway 删除33：<u></u>. The increased leukotriene biosynthesis leads to bronchial smooth muscle constriction and cell proliferation， plasma leak-age， mucus hypersecretion， and eosinophil migration， culminating in symptoms of wheezing and asthma exacerbation. Leukotriene E4 levels can be measured in the urine. In patients with aspirin sensitivity， E4 levels are higher at baseline and rise an additional fivefold after aspirin ingestion before returning to baseline as the aspirin-induced wheezing resolves.\n\n【21】Answer 7\n\n【22】Repeated administration of relatively high doses of allergen by subcutaneous injec-tion is thought to favor antigen presentation by antigen-presenting cells that produce IL-12. This results in the induction of THl cells rather than TH2 cells. The presence of THl cells tends to lead to an IgG antibody response rather than an IgE response because the THl cells produce IFN-Y， which prevents further isotype switching to IgE. The IgG antibody competes with the IgE antibody for antigen. Furthermore， IgG bound to allergen inhibits mast-cell activation (via FceRI) and B-cell activation(via surface immunoglobulin) by allergen because of inhibitory signals delivered subsequent to the binding of Feg receptors on these cells. This is thought to be one 删除换行1 mechanism damping down the allergic response. Another is no further boosting of IgE production because IL-4 and IL-13 are not secreted. Existing IgE levels them-selves may not fall by much， because IFN-y does not affect B cells that have already switched to IgE production.\n\n【23】Answer 8\n\n【24】Most human allergy is caused by a limited number of inhaled protein allergens that elicit a TH2 response in genetically predisposed individuals. These allergens are relatively small， highly soluble protein molecules that are presented to the immune system by the mucosal route at very low doses. It has been estimated that the maxi-mum exposure to ragweed pollen allergens is less than 1 ug per year. It seems that transmucosal presentation of very low doses of allergens favors the activation of IL-4-producingTH2 cells and is particularly efficient at inducing IgE responses. The dominant antigen-presenting cell type in the respiratory mucosa expresses highlev-els of co-stimulatory B7.2 molecules. Expression of B7.2 on antigen-presenting cells is thought to favor the development of TH2 cells.

Skin biopsy showed a sparse, superficial, perivascular dermatitis with suprabasal acantholysis. Direct immunofluorescence was positive for IgG and C3 in an intercellular pattern. The patient was started on prednisone at 80 mg per day by an outside dermatologist 1 month prior to referral. Her disease flared when she attempted to taper the prednisone below 80 mg per day, with painful erosions that interfered with eating on her left and right buccal mucosa, and on the left side of her mouth, as well as extensive erosions on her chest and back, and some erosions on her legs.\n\n【13】Based on the case description, what is the next step in treatment?\n\n【14】Treatment\n---------\n\n【15】Adjuvant rituximab\n\n【16】Discussion\n----------\n\n【17】Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is a potentially life-threatening autoimmune bullous dermatosis of the skin and/or mucous membranes caused by autoantibodies against the cadherins desmoglein 1 and desmoglein 3. Standard treatment of PV requires high-dose prednisone at 1–2 mg/kg/day that may be combined with other immunosuppressive medications such as cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil. Per the International Pemphigus Committee’s 2008 consensus statement, failure of PV therapy is defined as the, “continued development of new lesions, continued extension of old lesions, or failure of established lesions to begin to heal despite 3 weeks of therapy on 1.5 mg/kg/day of prednisone” with or without the additional immunosuppressive agents mentioned above 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】For patients with refractory PV, contraindications to immunosuppressive therapies, and/or severe and debilitating PV that will not likely respond to a standard treatment regimen, therapy focuses on depleting the desmoglein antibodies. Rituximab and/or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) are used in such cases. Rituximab is generally preferred due to the better side effect profile and lower cost.\n\n【19】### Rituximab\n\n【20】Rituximab is an IgG antibody that targets the CD20 antigen of B lymphocytes, the precursor cell to antibody producing plasma cells. It depletes the pathogenic desmoglein antibodies in PV for 6–12 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Rituximab is FDA approved for various leukemias and lymphomas, rheumatoid arthritis, and some vasculitides. It is used off-label for PV.\n\n【21】The optimal dosing protocol of rituximab for PV treatment is unclear. Initial PV treatment with rituximab used the lymphoma dosing protocol of four weekly 375 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> infusions. More recent studies examined the use of the rheumatoid arthritis dosing of 1,000 mg twice, 2 weeks apart. In a meta-analysis of 42 case reports and case series from 2000 to 2012 of rituximab therapy in PV patients recalcitrant to standard therapies, complete remission was achieved in 67 % (32/48) of patients from case reports and in 67 % (56/84) of patients from case series using the lymphoma protocol compared to 79 % (n = 59/75) of patients from case series following the RA protocol 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Both dosing protocols required the concurrent use of prednisone and/or other systemic therapies. Seven patients following the lymphoma protocol did not respond to treatment, while no patients on the RA protocol were non-responders. Relapse occurred in 23 % (30/132) of patients on the lymphoma protocol and in 36 % (27/75) on the RA protocol. Overall, this meta-analysis found that patients in the RA protocol had a higher response rate, a higher relapse rate, a higher number of infections, and a lower mortality rate compared to the lymphoma protocol. A recent, prospective, randomized, observer blinded study of 22 patients with PV or pemphigus foliaceus (PF) found no difference in time to disease control between patients treated with low dose rituximab (two 500 mg doses, 15 days apart) compared to the higher dose RA protocol, although relapse was more common and more adjuvant immunosuppressive therapy was needed in the low dose group 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】A multicenter, prospective study of 14 PV patients with refractory disease treated with a single cycle of rituximab using the lymphoma protocol suggests that a second cycle of rituximab may be required only in relapse that cannot be controlled with first-line therapies. This study reported that 86 % (12/14) of subjects had complete remission of disease (defined as the epithelization of all skin and mucosal lesions) 3 months after the last infusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Of the remaining two subjects, one had complete remission by 180 days and the other by 360 days. All patients that were concurrently treated with steroids were able to significantly reduce their baseline prednisone dose. At the 34 month follow-up, 57 % (8/14) of subjects remained free of disease.\n\n【23】In a later study, Lunardon et al. found that 100 % (24/24) of severe and/or refractory PV patients treated with rituximab had clinical disease activity improvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Patients were treated with either the lymphoma or RA dosing protocol for up to four cycles if needed to improve the clinical outcome or to treat relapses. 58 % (14/24) of patients reached the study endpoint: complete remission on no or minimal systemic therapy. There was no significant difference between the two protocols in achieving this end point. In addition, 46 % of patients (11/24) attained complete remission on no systemic therapy. Of note, the study examined an additional seven patients with PF and found similar results. The median relapse-free remission time of the combined PV and PF patients was 19 months. This study also found a significant decrease in the serum desmoglein index value (median change of −80 %) in ten paired serum samples of patients before and after therapy. Finally, the study found that treatment with rituximab earlier in the disease course yielded better outcomes. The median duration of disease prior to rituximab therapy was 19 months for patients who achieved complete remission on no or minimal systemic therapy compared to 86 months for patients who did not. The mechanism of incomplete remission and/or relapse in some PV patients treated with rituximab is unclear, but may be attributed to persistent B cells in the spleen or lymph nodes, or new bone marrow-derived B cells with novel immunoglobulin rearrangements 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】The most common side effects of rituximab treatment are mild, infusion-related events such as headache, fever, chills, nausea, pruritus, and hypotension that can be reduced with premedication. The most concerning adverse effect is serious and/or fatal infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. In a recent study of rituximab therapy in ANCA-associated vasculitides, severe infections occurred in 15 % (12/80) of patients and caused four deaths (5 %) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Late-onset infections are possible, occurring up to 85 months after the first rituximab dose, and up to 10 months after the last rituximab dose in a study of 17 patients with vasculitis followed for at least 3 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. It is unclear if the increased risk of infection is due to rituximab itself, secondary to a reduced number of B cells, or from the multiple immunosuppressive therapies that patients are often taking concurrently, particularly because some patients with normal IgG levels experienced serious infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Patients with severe infections should not receive rituximab. Patients should be tested for tuberculosis and hepatitis prior to rituximab therapy, as well as receive immunizations such as pneumovax, if age appropriate.\n\n【25】Screening for hepatitis B virus (HBV) must include tests for both the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and the hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) prior to the initiation of treatment. In September 2013, the FDA issued a new Boxed Warning for rituximab following 109 cases of fatal HBV induced acute liver injury, including cases of HBV reactivation in patients with previously resolved HBV infections (HBsAg-, anti-HBc+, and hepatitis B surface antibody \\[anti-HBs\\]+) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Patients with prior HBV infection should be monitored for signs and symptoms of HBV reactivation both during and after the rituximab treatment by PCR for hepatitis B virus. If a patient experiences reactivation of HBV, an antiviral therapy should be initiated.\n\n【26】Other adverse events of rituximab therapy include: allergic infusion reactions, leukopenia, lymphopenia, neutropenia, and persistent hypogammaglobulinemia. Overall, rituximab is well tolerated and the side effects are moderate compared to the adverse effects of long-term, high-dose corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents. However, its use should be limited to severe, refractory PV because of the possible side effects.\n\n【27】### IVIG\n\n【28】The exact mechanism of action of IVIG in the treatment of PV is unclear. IVIG may have immunomodulatory actions on both B and T cell function, reduce serum levels of anti-desmoglein antibodies, and/or modify the function of the Fc receptor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 14 \\]</u>. The first randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial with IVIG in pemphigus was reported in 2009 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Twenty-one patients with PV and PF received 400 mg/kg/day of IVIG; 20 patients received 200 mg/kg/day of IVIG; and, 20 patients received placebo. Each patient group received five consecutive days of treatment with the assigned therapy. The time to escape from the protocol (the time until additional treatment was needed) was significantly prolonged for the 400 mg/kg/day group compared to the placebo group (P < 0.001), and a dose-response relationship in this outcome was observed among the three groups. There was no significant difference in adverse drug reactions among the three arms.\n\n【29】While the use of IVIG in PV has a corticosteroid sparing effect, 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u> IVIG should be used prudently due to its expense (often greater than $100,000 a year) and side effect profile. The most concerning adverse effect of IVIG is thrombotic events, such as stroke or myocardial infarction. No study has quantified the incidence of thrombotic events with IVIG therapy in PV. In the authors’ experience, the high incidence of thrombosis is concerning and requires caution, especially as PV patients may have anticardiolipin antibodies that already predispose them to thrombotic events. Further studies on the incidence of thrombosis during IVIG therapy are needed.\n\n【30】The most common side effect of IVIG is an infusion-related headache. Such headaches can be reduced with a slower infusion rate and acetaminophen. Other adverse effects of IVIG include: chills, hypotension, fever, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, infusion-site reactions, hemolysis, neutropenia, anaphylaxis in IgA deficiency, aseptic meningitis, and the potential to transfuse infectious agents.\n\n【31】### Rituximab and IVIG\n\n【32】IVIG may be added to rituximab therapy in PV to hasten disease resolution. IVIG may also provide protection from rituximab-induced hypogammaglobulinemia, and may therefore decrease the risk of infection with rituximab. However, infection with rituximab therapy may occur up to 18 months after treatment, 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> which would not be prevented by combined rituximab and IVIG treatment early in PV therapy.\n\n【33】A study of 11 patients with PV refractory to conventional therapy or IVIG that were treated with a combination of IVIG and rituximab found that nine patients had rapid resolution of their clinical pemphigus disease activity lasting 22–37 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. All 11 patients were able to discontinue all additional immunosuppressive therapies before the end of the study. This study reported no clinically significant adverse effects, including no infections.\n\n【34】Key Points\n----------\n\n【35】   Rituximab is the mainstay of treatment for patients with severe PV that is refractory to standard treatments. It produces complete remission in over 65 % of patients, and enables patients to reduce or discontinue toxic immunosuppressive therapies. Rituximab is more effective if used early in the course of PV.\n   IVIG may be used alone or in combination with rituximab to more quickly reduce disease activity, but should be reserved for patients with severe disease due to its high cost and risk of thrombotic events.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

This patient has Gilbert syndrome, the most common inherited disorder of bilirubin conjugation. It is due to a gene mutation that results in a decreased level of uridine diphosphate glucuronyl transferase (UDPGT). The disease is autosomal recessive; in the Western world, approximately 9% of people are homozygous for the mutation, and 30% are heterozygous (heterozygotes are asymptomatic). The disease commonly first manifests in young adults after an inciting event, such as a febrile illness, physical exertion, stress, or fasting. Laboratory tests will demonstrate unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, but will be otherwise normal. The disease is benign and requires no treatment. This patient has a mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and is otherwise healthy besides a mild flu-like illness, so Gilbert is the most likely diagnosis.  \nAnswer A is incorrect . Corticosteroids would be useful for treatment of autoimmune hemolytic anemia. In hemolytic anemia, lactate dehydrogenase is commonly elevated, haptoglobin is decreased, and hemoglobin is low. All of these levels are normal in this patient, so autoimmune hemolytic anemia is unlikely.  \nAnswer C is incorrect . Pegylated interferon is useful in treating chronic hepatitis C infection (HCV). HCV would present with increased aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, and if advanced, signs of cirrhosis. This patient has an isolated hyperbilirubinemia, so HCV is unlikely. An acute HCV infection can present in a variety of ways, including hyperbilirubinemia, but interferon is not used for acute HCV, so this is not the best answer.  \nAnswer D is incorrect . Crigler-Najjar syndrome is similar to Gilbert syndrome in that it is caused by a mutation in the gene coding for UDPGT. However, in Crigler-Najjar syndrome the enzyme is severely lacking or completely absent. Type I is most severe, causing death early in life from kernicterus. Type II is milder and more responsive to treatment. Phenobarbital is useful in lowering the bilirubin concentration in type II but not type I disease. This patient is asymptomatic and is presenting later in life; thus this cannot be Crigler-Najjar syndrome.  \nAnswer E is incorrect . Ursodeoxycholic acid (ursodiol) is used for gallstone dissolution in patients who cannot tolerate surgery. This patient has normal alkaline phosphatase levels, which would be elevated in cholelithiasis. Furthermore, if this patient did have gallstones, he would likely be treated with surgery, which is much more effective than ursodiol.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

On the other hand, it  删除换行1 is also said that chronic lung damage induced by ABPA appears to provide a favorable  删除换行1 conditions for the formation of aspergilloma which might be accelerated by therapy with  删除换行1 corticosteroids. Although cavitations is uncommon in a case of ABPA, but it may occur  删除换行1 in 3% of cases, which can be colonized by Aspergillus to form aspergilloma. Occurrence  删除换行1 of ABPA in our patient, who is a sugar mill worker, is significant in the light of previous  删除换行1 literature on occurrence of this disease entity in sugar mill workers. Process of lung  删除换行1 destruction proceeds silently in ABPA as about one third of these cases are completely  删除换行1 asymptomatic. In present case, it appears that patient had already developed central  删除换行1 bronchiectasis and aspergilloma. It was this indolent course of disease which prevented  删除换行1 our patient from seeking timely medical advice on one hand and delayed the diagnosis  删除换行1 on the other hand. Frequently, symptoms like hemoptysis, cough, fever etc. caused by  删除换行5 ABPA/aspergilloma are attributed to active tuberculosis and managed incorrectly, as  删除换行1 happened in our case. Since it is not uncommon to detect evidence of hypersensitivity to \n\n【9】Aspergillus, in presence of aspergilloma, and aspergilloma can develop as a complication  删除换行1 of ABPA, it may almost be impossible to establish whether ABPA followed or preceded the  删除换行1 development of aspergilloma (as in our case). A wide variety of chest radiographic changes  删除换行1 are known to be associated with ABPA. These changes include normal chest radiography,  删除换行1 hyperinflation, various infiltrate patterns, consolidation, parallel lines and ring shadows,  删除换行1 nodules, avascular areas, “honey combing”, “tooth paste” shadows, “gloved finger”, band  删除换行1 shadows and tramline shadows, changes such as fibrosing alveolitis, lobar shrinkage,  删除换行1 and atelectasis as well as pseudo hilar adenopathy and pleural thickening. Although the  删除换行1 chest radiographic appearance is commonly abnormal in patients with ABPA, it is not  删除换行1 invariably so, nor does a normal appearance exclude the diagnosis of ABPA. CT of the  删除换行1 thorax can provide a sensitive method for the assessment of bronchial, parenchymal, and  删除换行1 pleural abnormalities in patients with ABPA and should constitute a part of the diagnostic  删除换行1 work-up of the disease along with plain chest radiographs. Oral corticosteroids, to date,  删除换行1 remain the cornerstone for the treatment of ABPA. The exact role of antifungal agents  删除换行1 is yet to be determined for both ABPA as well as aspergilloma. Specific therapy is not  删除换行1 required for patients with asymptomatic aspergilloma. Surgical treatment carries risk with  删除换行1 mortality ranging from 7 to 23%, due to which it should be considered in patients with  删除换行1 massive hemoptysis and adequate pulmonary reserve.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Other predictors of postoperative pulmonary complications include：通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> an FEV， lower than 2 L， 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> the ratio of FEV，/FVC of less than0.5， 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> the VC of less than 15 cc/kg， and 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> the presence of hypox-emia on the arterial blood gas.\n\n【35】26.5. D. Adjusting the minute ventilation， respiratory rate， and tidal vol-ume help improve oxygenation during one lung ventilation. In addi-tion， PEEP can be applied to the dependent (ventilated) lung and CPAP can be applied to the nondependent (nonventilated) lung to improve oxygenation during one lung ventilation. With respect to answer C， positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) cannot be added 删除换行1 to the nondependent lung because the nondependent (operative) lung is not ventilated， and PEEP can only be added to a ventilated circuit. Increasing the concentration of an inhaled anesthetic to aid bronchodilation is only helpful if the patient is wheezing. Adding mild suction to the nondependent (nonventilated) lung will not affect oxygenation.\n\n【36】26.6. D. The presence of a new left bundle-branch block (LBBB) on the preoperative ECG may indicate cardiac disease. Since this patient has low functional capacity due to shortness of breath with exertion， it is important to determine if his dyspnea is due to COPD and lung cancer or cardiac disease caused by myocardial ischemia. A chemical stress test (myocardial perfusion scan and dobutamine stress echo) will help to determine if dyspnea is due to cardiac or pulmonary pathophysiology. Shortness of breath with exercise can indicate a severely depressed systolic myocardial function， and stress-induced ischemia.\n\n【37】Clinical Pearls\n\n【38】\\> It is important to thoroughly evaluate the patient undergoing lung sur-gery to determine the risk for anesthesia and surgery.\n\n【39】FEarly detection and treatment of lung cancer offers better outcome.Iftime permits， then patient's medical problems need to be optimized prior to surgery.\n\n【40】FFor patients scheduled for lung resection surgery， especially with lobec-tomy and pneumonectomy， it is important to determine whether or not the patient has enough pulmonary reserve to undergo the surgical proce-dure.Pulmonary function tests，room air arterial blood gas， split lung func-tion test， and pulmonary artery balloon-occlusion test can help predict patient's postoperative outcome after lung resection surgery， and are especially important prior to a pneumonectomy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The patient describes a pattern of decreased need for sleep， yet with no decrease in energy level， which is highly suggestive of a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. He may have had similar episodes in the past， but such patients generally seek help when they are depressed， as opposed to when they are hypomanic or manic. Increased goal-directed activity and excessive pleasure-seeking activities such as drug use are hallmarks of a manic episode. However， it is often very difficult to distinguish between a primary mood disorder and a substance/medication-induced one (answer B) without an extended period of abstinence accompanied by continuing mood complaints. Adjustment dis-order (answer D) or circadian rhythm disorder (answer E) does not explain this patient's array of symptoms.\n\n【26】11.2 D. Answer D (fatigue，increased appetite， vivid and unpleasant dreams) would be most characteristic of cocaine intoxication； cocaine stimulates adrenergic stimulation. Answer A (miosis， slurred speech， drowsiness) is consistent with opioid intoxication； respiratory depression is also common. Answer B\n\n【27】(nystagmus， hypertension， muscle rigidity) describes the classic findings of phencyclidine intoxication. Answer C (conjunctival injection， increased appe-tite， dry mouth) is indicative of cannabis intoxication. Answer E (mydriasis， gooseflesh， rhinorrhea， muscle aches) is consistent with opioid withdrawal.\n\n【28】11.3 A. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders， 5th edition (DSM-5) does not specifically recognize cannabis-induced mood disorders. Mood disorders would be mu1.ch more common with the other substances listed (answer B， cocaine； answer C， alcohol； answer D， methamphetamine； and answer E， inhaling spray paint).\n\n【29】11.4 A. In answer A， the timing and the likely offending agent are most consis-tent with a substance/medication-induced depressive disorder. In answer B， there is likely a strong genetic component to his depression， and there is no mention of his depression's relationship to any periods of sobriety. Cannabis(answer C) is not clearly likely to induce depression， especially at low doses. Answer D is more consistent with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Answer E is most consistent with bereavement.\n\n【30】11.5 C. Beta-blockers are a first-line treatment for essential tremor. Depression is a known potential side effect of beta-blockers. For answers A (hypothyroidism) and B (hypoandrogenism)，levothyroxine and testosterone can mimic mania. In answer D， there is the possibility that the person is treating the rhinorrhea with pseudoephedrine. High-dose， prolonged pseudoephedrine use can cause psychosis or symptoms that mimic mania. Parkinson disease (answer E) is often treated with dopaminergic medications， which can lead to psychosis.\n\n【31】The symptoms of a substance/medication-induced depressive disorder can occur during the period of time the substance is being used or up to a month after use of the substance has ceased.\n\n【32】In order for the mood symptoms to be accurately assessed， the patient should not be acutely intoxicated or undergoing the withdrawal process.\n\n【33】Individuals with medical conditions often take medications for those conditions， and it may sometimes be difficult to discern which (the medical condition or the medication used to treat it) may be causing the depressive disorder.\n\n【34】The history often provides a basis for judgment， or a medication change may be needed to sort out the diagnosis.\n\n【35】A depressive disorder should be diagnosed when it is judged that the substance/medication in question is not etiologically related to the symptoms of depression.\n删除20：<u>DSM-5 Task Force.

He is having trouble maintaining consciousness. The patient’s electrocardiogram (ECG) reveals third-degree heart block with a heart rate of 34 beats/minute and a blood pressure reading of 90/55 mm Hg. The patient’s cardiac instability calls for immediate intervention. As the attending physician and senior resident are attempting to place a transvenous pacemaker, the attending physician orders the medical student on the team to consult the critical care unit (CCU) service. The medical student proceeds to the nearest telephone. CCU fellow: “CCU.” Student: “Uh, hi, I’m a student in the ED. We have a patient down here with third-degree heart block. They’re placing a transvenous pacemaker right now.” CCU fellow: “I’m extremely busy right now. What do you need?” Student: “Well, I’m supposed to call you, right?” The CCU fellow sighs and hangs up the phone and arrives in the ED 45 minutes after hanging up. He approaches the team workstation and yells angrily, “You had a student consult me again!”\n\n【3】 How would you characterize the consultation?\n\n【4】 How does the consultant’s behavior affect the patient?\n\n【5】### ANSWERS TO CASE 21:\n\n【6】#### Difficult Consultation\n\n【7】Summary: An elderly patient in the ED is unstable with third-degree heart block. The attending physician requests that the medical student on the team places a CCU consultation. The student did not use the proper consultation technique while on the phone with the CCU fellow. The CCU fellow inappropriately hung up on the student. He arrives in the ED 45 minutes later and yells at the health care team.\n\n【8】 How would you characterize the consultation? This was a difficult consultation that was disruptive.\n\n【9】 How does the consultant’s behavior affect the patient? The consultant’s behavior puts the patient’s health and well-being at risk and could have lead to the patient losing trust in the health care professionals.\n\n【10】### ANALYSIS\n\n【11】##### Objectives\n\n【12】1\\. Understand what needs to be taken into consideration when requesting physician consultation.\n\n【13】2\\. Describe the 5 Cs model for a proper physician consultation.\n\n【14】3\\. Identify ways in which to deal with a difficult or disruptive physician.\n\n【15】##### Considerations\n\n【16】Unfortunately, the consultation interaction between the medical student and the CCU fellow did not go well and can best be characterized as difficult. As a result of this interaction, the patient is not receiving appropriate care, the medical student is left demoralized, and the fellow is angry. Interpersonal skills and effective communication between providers are often overlooked in the stressful environment of the medical setting. Providers may have different cultural backgrounds, training experience, and personality differences, which only add to the chaos in communicating patient information. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education formally recognizes interpersonal skills as a required core competency for residents in all fields. Proper communication of medical information requires effective interpersonal skills. Suboptimal communication of patient information threatens both patient and medical staff safety. The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations has shown that communication failure was the major cause of studied preventable sentinel events that led to patient harm between 2004 and 2012. Patients view physicians as calm, collected, confident, compassionate, respectful, mature, and strong individuals. It is expected that medical providers overcome personal distractions and stress when caring for others. Failure to maintain these standards threatens patient care and safety. When a provider exhibits disruptive emotion in the health care setting, he or she also places stress on the entire team. Moreover, one provider’s emotional instability can affect more than just a single patient.\n\n【17】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【18】#### The Medical Consultation\n\n【19】Medical resource and specialty expansion makes physician consultation a daily activity for most providers. It has been shown that consultations are performed on up to 40% of patients presenting to the ED. The modernization of medicine itself further complicates the effective communication of medical information. When does one acquire the skills to effectively consult another provider? For the most part, these critical skills are developed through observation during one’s undergraduate medical education and further honed during residency training.\n\n【20】The consultation process requires attention to skill, attitude, and behavior. The approach begins with a proper introduction and identification of all involved parties. This is not only essential for documentation, but it exemplifies respect and cooperation. The reason for consultation should not be excluded under the assumption that the consultant’s experience eliminates the need for step-by-step case description; this information can always be communicated in a manner that is not condescending when the objective to attain a consultation, not a service, is kept in mind. The urgency of the consultation must be made clear early in the process, allowing the consultant to better organize their approach to the case. The case should be formally presented and include all pertinent information, as if the consultant knows nothing about the patient. An organized consultation report should follow the conversation, as anyone can always refer back to documentation. Lastly, preparation is the key. Be prepared to provide any of the patient’s information and answer questions prior to calling in the consultation. All learners should be prepared to ask questions of their team prior to engaging in the consultative process if any uncertainty as to the purpose of the consult is present.\n\n【21】Multiple communication models have been developed and adapted to the medical profession to bridge gaps in communication during hand-offs and consultation requests. Two of the most commonly used techniques are the 5Cs and the situation, background, assessment, and recommendation (SBAR) technique, which was originally developed by the US military . Its use became widespread in the health care industry in the 1990s. Similarly, the 5Cs model has been shown to significantly improve the quality of communication during consultation . Both are appropriate approaches to physician consultation.\n删除4：<u>Table 21–1 • SBAR MODEL FOR PHYSICIAN CONSULTATION</u>\n删除4：<u>Table 21–2 • THE 5Cs MODEL FOR PHYSICIAN CONSULTATION</u>\n\n【22】##### Application of the 5Cs Model\n\n【23】CCU fellow: “CCU.”\n\n【24】5Cs Student ( Contact ): “Hello, my name is John Doe. I am a third-year medical student on service in the ED. My supervising attending is Dr Jane Smith. With whom am I speaking?”\n\n【25】CCU fellow: “This is Dr Davis; I’m the CCU fellow on service. I’m extremely busy right now. What do you need?”\n\n【26】5Cs Student ( Communicate ): “We have a 74-year-old man with symptomatic bradycardia who was brought to the ED complaining of weakness and dizziness. He is located in Shock room 3. He is unstable as he is having difficulty maintaining consciousness. Telemetry and ECG demonstrates third-degree heart block. He was given atropine and transcutaneous pacing was attempted by emergency medical services prior to arrival without electrical or mechanical capture. His heart rate is currently 34 beats/minute and his blood pressure is 90/55 mm Hg. Dr Smith and her resident, Dr Mark, are currently intubating the patient and setting up to place a transvenous pacemaker.”\n\n【27】CCU fellow: “Well, what exactly do you need from me?”\n\n【28】5Cs Student ( Core question ): “Based on the information I provided over the phone, do you have any recommendations or instructions such as additional laboratory or radiographic testing or medication or equipment orders that I may pass on to the team to facilitate your consultation? Also, if you could please let me know when the team should expect you to arrive, we can make sure to have everything you need either already completed or at the patient’s bedside.”\n\n【29】CCU fellow: “Thank you. I’ll be available to evaluate the patient within 20 minutes. In the meantime, please proceed with transvenous pacemaker placement. I’d like cardiac enzymes, a BMP (basic metabolic panel) and BNP (brain natriuretic peptide) and a chest radiograph ready for me when I arrive if they have not already been ordered.”\n\n【30】5Cs Student ( Collaboration and Closing the loop ): “Okay, we will see you here in the ED in 20 minutes. I will check to see if cardiac enzymes, a BMP, a BNP, and a chest radiograph have been ordered. If not, I will notify Dr Smith of your request for laboratory studies and imaging. I will also notify Dr Smith of your recommendation to continue with the transvenous pacemaker placement. We will alert you immediately with any change in patient status. Thank you, Dr Davis.”\n\n【31】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【32】#### The Disruptive Physician\n\n【33】What is a disruptive physician? The American Medical Association’s Code of Medical Ethics defines disruptive physician behavior as “personal conduct, whether verbal or physical, that negatively affects or that potentially may negatively affect patient care.” Verbal behaviors include, but are not limited to, yelling and profanity.\n\n【34】Medical students are commonly abused by disruptive physicians. Many students are unwilling to report such behavior due to their fear of retaliation. Student abuse has consequences extending beyond the student’s embarrassment, depression, and guilt. Physicians serve as role models for students and provide examples of appropriate or inappropriate behavior as learners advance through their career.\n\n【35】Disruptive physicians breach their duties and violate codes of medical ethics and professionalism. Medicine is a team effort, and medical students are members of the team. As stated in the ethics manual of the American College of Physicians, “Physicians share their commitment to care for ill persons with a broad team of health professionals. The team’s ability to care effectively for the patient depends on the ability of individual persons to treat each other with integrity, honesty, and respect.” They go on to say that particular attention should be paid to relationships with inherent power imbalances due to the potential for abuse. Most institutions have developed protocols aimed to manage disruptive physician behavior. Reporters should be reassured not to fear retaliation, because these protocols are instrumental in protecting patient and staff safety and staff wellness.\n\n【36】The CCU fellow is an example of a disruptive physician. Even with the medical student’s poor initial consultation technique, it was unethical and abusive to hang up on the student. If the fellow was actively engaged in caring for another patient at the time of the consultation call, then it would have been acceptable for him to be brief and direct with the student in providing his recommendations. However, there is often a fine line between being direct and to the point when communicating with medical personnel, patients, or family members and being perceived as short or rude. Such perceptions can be colored based on cultural backgrounds and training norms but a wise practitioner will always air on the side of being polite and professional. In addition, by hanging up on the student, the fellow failed to gather the details of the patient’s case in order to prepare for the encounter and determine patient priority. Personal frustrations, even when justified, cannot be permitted to interfere with the quality of patient care. Furthermore, yelling is disruptive and inappropriate in any medical setting. The fellow’s overall demeanor was not conducive to a multidisciplinary collaboration in medicine.\n\n【37】Disruptive behavior results in a breakdown of effective communication and may stem from a physician’s significant emotional or physical stress, including exhaustion or illness. Repeat episodes of disruptive behavior are often a hallmark of drug or alcohol abuse and represent opportunities to intervene and assist the impaired provider and protect the public.\n\n【38】In the case above, the fellow’s actions should be reported to the attending ED physician. The attending physician can then address the fellow’s behavior at such a time as not to compromise patient care. Patient care must take priority to addressing lapses in medical ethics and professionalism. In other words, it would be inappropriate for the attending physician to chastise the fellow for his treatment of the medical student immediately upon arriving at the patient’s bedside. However, once the patient is stabilized, the attending physician should privately speak to the fellow to address the lapse, with one goal being an apology to the student. A private conversation will also allow the fellow an opportunity to express his frustration at the poor quality of the initial consultation by the student and give the fellow and the attending physician an opportunity to teach the student more effective consultation techniques.\n\n【39】If the matter is not satisfactorily resolved or represents a pattern of behavior by the consultant, the attending ED physician should report the fellow’s behavior to the cardiology department because remediation may be necessary. If the fellow’s supervisors fail to curb his disruptive behavior, then the fellow’s actions should be brought to the attention of hospital administrators.\n\n【40】###", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The regimen described in option“B\"was used in the MAGIC trial that included only patients with adenocarcinoma of the stomach and GE junction. Anti-Her2 strategies have been found to benefit patients with gastric adenocarcinoma and GE-junction adenocarcinomas.\n\n【31】16.2 C. Gastroesophageal reflux is a known risk factor for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and confers a relative risk of 7.7-fold.Smoking， alcohol consump-tion， and nitrite and nitrate containing foods are risk factors associated with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus.\n\n【32】16.3 B. The transhiatal esophagectomy when compared to the Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy (abdomen + right chest) is associated with less physiologic insult and lower respiratory complication rates. However， the operation is theoretically less oncologic because clear radial margins are not sought. Because the anastomosis is in the neck， leakages are not usually lethal com-plications following transhiatal esophagectomies.\n\n【33】16.4E. Squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus is highly radiation responsive. The incidence of squamous cell carcinoma ofthe esophagus has not increased over the past 10 years； the increase in esophageal cancer has been associated with the increase in adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.\n\n【34】16.5A. Recurrent obstruction may develop as the result oftumor progression and stent migration. Following stent placements，esophageal obstructions usually improve fairly quickly. TEF is not a contraindication to stent placement， in fact covered stent placement is a palliative treatment for TEF. Worsening GE reflux is common after stent placement.\n\n【35】16.6 B. This patient has a stage IB adenocarcinoma of the esophagus， with this depth of penetration， regional LN metastasis and distant micrometastatic disease are highly likely； therefore， the treatment needs to be systemic in addition to esophagectomy.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of the gram-negative cell walls consists of a complex lipid, lipid A, to which is attached a polysaccharide made up of a core and a terminal series of repeat units. LPS is attached to the outer membrane by hydrophobic bonds and is required for the function of many outer membrane proteins. LPS is also called endotoxin. All the toxicity resides in the lipid A component. Endotoxin (lipid A) can activate complement, resulting in inflammation and the clinical features referred to in the question.\n\n【20】Question: 23.4 A 50-year-old man recently visited India and developed diarrhea before returning to the United States.

The O antigen of Vibrio species has been given numbers to indicate biotype, a form of subdivision for strains of cholera organism. V. cholera e serogroups O1 and O139 have long been recognized as strains responsible for epidemic and pandemic cholera. There have been 6 pandemics from 1817 to 1923, most likely caused by the O1 subtype. A new pandemic caused by the El Tor biotype started in Asia in 1961 and spread to Central and South America by 1991. The disease and biotype is rare in North America, but it does have an endemic focus on the Gulf of Mexico coastal areas (Louisiana and Texas).\n\n【24】MICROBIOLOGY PEARLS\n\n【25】 The A subunit of the Vibrio enterotoxin activates adenyl cyclase, resulting in the hypersecretion of water, sodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate into the intestinal lumen.\n\n【26】 The predominant clinical presentation of Vibrio gastroenteritis is watery diarrhea.\n\n【27】 The Vibrio organism appears as gram-negative, curved, motile bacilli. Vibrio gastroenteritis or cholera is associated with consumption of contaminated seafood or water.\n\n【28】 V. vulnificus is associated with cellulitis caused by trauma incurred in a seawater environment and carries a high mortality rate if not rapidly treated.\n\n【29】 Vibrio species require salt for growth and can be differentiated from other organisms by growth on TCBS agar.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

He has received blood transfusions since early infancy but has not received a transfusion in >4 months.

Thalassemias are inherited diseases involving decreased synthesis or complete absence of either the α-globin chain or the β-globin chain of Hb. This patient has classic symptoms of severe β-thalassemia (Cooley anemia): hemolytic anemia, hepatosplenomegaly, and “chipmunk facies” (reflecting the extramedullary hematopoiesis in the bones of the face). The requirement for blood transfusions since birth should raise the suspicion for β-thalassemia major, but the Hb electrophoresis results alone can be used to arrive at this conclusion. This patient shows increased HbF (α2γ2) and HbA2 (α2δ2); thus synthesis of the α-chain is intact. Absence of HbA1 (α2β2) supports an absence of β-chain synthesis and, therefore, a diagnosis of β-thalassemia major. Death in these individuals often is caused by cardiac failure secondary to hemochromatosis.  \nAnswer A is incorrect . α-Thalassemia minor is associated with a two-gene deletion of α-globin (two gene regions out of four are intact). A mild anemia will be present, but the electrophoresis results will be normal, because the two remaining α-globin genes produce sufficient α-globin chains for normal HbA1 levels. Deletion of only a single α-gene results in an asymptomatic carrier with no hematologic manifestations.  \nAnswer C is incorrect . β-Thalassemia minor (the heterozygous defect) would show decreased but not absent HbA1 . This is a less severe form of the disease. β-Thalassemia minor confers a mild protective effect against Plasmodium falciparum malaria because of the shortened lifespan of the RBCs.  \nAnswer D is incorrect . Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency does not present with an abnormal Hb electrophoresis.  \nAnswer E is incorrect . HbH is associated with three-gene deletion of a-globin. The abnormal Hb molecule (HbH) contains four β-chains, and is detected by electrophoresis. The β-thal-assemias are more prevalent in Mediterranean people, whereas the α-thalassemias are more prevalent in Asian and African populations.  \nAnswer F is incorrect . Hb Bart is the most severe of the hemoglobinopathies, involving deletion of all four α-globin genes. This results in the absence of all hemoglobins that require this chain and the sole production of Hb Bart, a tetramer of the γ-chain (normally a component of HbF). This condition leads to hydrops fetalis and intrauterine fetal death. Hb Bart is detected by electrophoresis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Important negative features of the history include no travel, not eating out  删除换行1 and no illness in other care home residents.\nC. difficile is an anaerobic, spore-forming bacterium that is carried in the gut of some people.\nIt causes disease (pseudomembranous colitis) through production of toxins that damage the  删除换行1 colonic mucosa. In severe disease it can lead to toxic megacolon, bowel perforation and death.\nThe differential diagnosis of watery diarrhoea includes: \n\n【15】•\t Viral—Enterovirus, rotavirus (usually in children), and norovirus (in which vomiting is almost always present)\n•\t Bacterial—Campylobacter spp. C. difficile, Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella sp. Shigella sp.\n(usually bloody diarrhoea), Vibrio cholera (associated with contact or travel to endemic  删除换行1 areas)\n•\t Parasitic—Giardia lamblia (appropriate travel history required) or cryptosporidium in  删除换行1 the immunocompromised or young children \n\n【16】•\t Toxins (which have the shortest incubation period after exposure)—Staphylococcal  删除换行1 food poisoning, Bacillus cereus toxin or enterotoxogenic Escherichia coli \n\n【17】•\t Non-infectious causes—Alcohol excess, lactose intolerance or inflammatory bowel  删除换行1 disease \n\n【18】Investigations of watery diarrhoea must include a stool sample sent for: \n\n【19】•\t Microscopy and culture and sensitivity (MC&S) for bacterial causes \n\n【20】•\t Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing looking for viral causes \n\n【21】•\t Ova, cysts and parasites \n\n【22】•\t C. difficile toxin testing, as only toxin-producing strains cause disease. Culture methods for C. difficile are slow and no longer used for diagnosis \n\n【23】Blood cultures are taken to exclude urinary sepsis and Gram-negative sepsis. The latter could  删除换行1 indicate a perforation of the gut or leakage of bowel contents that would indicate severe  删除换行1 colonic disease.\nTreatment is centred on removing risk factors as possible and treating with antibiotics (metronidazole or vancyomycin). Choice of antibiotics depends on the severity of the disease and  删除换行1 local hospital policy. In severe or life-threatening cases, surgical management may also be  删除换行1 required (colectomy). In chronic or recurrent cases, alternative therapy includes probiotics,  删除换行1 faecal enemas and fidaxomicin.\nPrevention is by eliminating risk factors, thereby reducing the likelihood of developing disease. Reduced transmission from person to person requires hand washing with soap and  删除换行1 water after every contact with a patient having diarrhoea.

She has hematuria and bone pain. Physical examination reveals her to be dehydrated. Plain x-ray of the abdomen reveals a radiopaque renal calculus on the right side. Serum calcium is found to be elevated. The patient’s past medical history is significant for an islet cell tumor of the pancreas (insulinoma).\n\n【1】What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【2】What is the reason for her dehydration?\n\n【3】What syndrome does this patient most likely have?\n\n【4】ANSWERS TO CASE 47： PRIMARY HYPERPARATHYROIDISM\n\n【5】Summary： A 30-year-old woman has hypercalcemia， renal stone， and bone pain， with a past history of islet cell tumor.\n\n【6】Most likely diagnosis： Primary hyperparathyroidism caused by an adenoma.\n\n【7】Reason for dehydration： Primary hyperparathyroidism results in hypercalcemia. This causes impairment of the action of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) at the collecting ducts. This is thus an example of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. These patients are expected to have polyuria and may become dehydrated， especially if water intake is not maintained.\n\n【8】Most likely syndrome： Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 1.\n\n【9】CLINICAL CORRELATION\n\n【10】In primary hyperparathyroidism， there is autonomous spontaneous overpro-duction of parathyroid hormone (PTH). The most common causes are an ade-noma (>80 percent of cases) and hyperplasia of all glands. Some of these cases are caused by inherited syndromes such as MEN type 1. High levels of PTH cause bone resorption with resultant hypercalcemia. High serum calcium then leads to metastatic calcification. One of the sites is the cornea. Hypercalcemia prevents the action of ADH on the collecting ducts， resulting in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and subsequent polyuria and polydipsia. Increased excre-tion of calcium through the renal tubules would result in renal stones. Hypercalcemia also is associated with peptic ulcer and pancreatitis. Psychiatric disturbances also are reported with hyperparathyroidism. All these possible features are very well put together in the phrase bones， stones， abdominal groans， and psychic moans.\n\n【11】APPROACH TO HYPERPARATHYROIDISM\n\n【12】Objectives\n\n【13】Know the signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia.\n\n【14】● Describe the causes of hypercalcemia and hypocalcemia.\n\n【15】List the most common cause of elevated PTH.\n\n【16】List the MEN syndromes.\n\n【17】Definitions\n\n【18】Primary hyperparathyroidism： Autonomous spontaneous overproduc-tion of PTH， most often as a result of an adenoma. Serum calcium lev-els are high.\n\n【19】Secondary hyperparathyroidism： Physiologic compensatory hypertrophy of the parathyroid glands caused by hypocalcemia. PTH levels are raised， but serum calcium is not elevated.\n\n【20】Tertiary hyperparathyroidism： Long-standing secondary hyperparathy-roidism leads to autonomous and hyperactive parathyroids. This occurs most often in the setting of chronic renal failure.\n\n【21】Primary hypoparathyroidism： Parathyroid underactivity resulting from intrinsic disease of the parathyroid glands. PTH levels are low.\n\n【22】Pseudohypoparathyroidism： End-organ resistance to PTH. The patient has hypocalcemia， and PTH levels are elevated.\n\n【23】DISCUSSION\n\n【24】There are two pairs of parathyroid glands， the superior and the inferior， located behind the thyroid. The superior pair is derived from the fourth pharyngeal pouch， and the inferior pair is derived from the third pharyngeal pouch. The superior pair is more constant in position. Parathyroid glands may be located elsewhere in the neck or mediastinum. The parathyroid glands secrete PTH， which is involved in calcium metabolism.\n\n【25】Calcium Metabolism\n\n【26】The normal range of serum calcium is 8.5 to 10.5 mg/dL， of which approxi-mately 40 to 50 percent is ionized and is physiologically active. The remain-der is bound to proteins， typically albumin. Calcium homeostasisSis maintained by parathyroid hormone， 1，25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (acti-vated vitamin D，)， and calcitonin. The effects of PTH and calcitonin on cal-cium levels are rapid. Several steps are involved in the production of1，25-dihydroxycholecalciferol； thus， the final effect of vitamin D on calcium levels is not immediate. Table 47-1 describes some of the causes of hypercal-cemia， and Table 47-2 lists the causes of hypocalcemia. Primary hyper-parathyroidism and malignancies remain the two most common causes(>90 percent) of hypercalcemia.\n\n【27】Parathyroid Hormone Metabolism\n\n【28】PTH is an 84-amino acid hormone and is secreted from the chief cells of the parathyroid glands. PTH levels rise as serum ionized calcium levels fall. PTH increases calcium levels by activating osteoclasts， which increase bone resorp-tion， increasing the intestinal absorption of calcium， promoting the formation\n\n【29】Table 47-1\n\n| SELECTED CAUSES OF HYPERCALCEMIA  |\n| --- |\n| Excess of parathyroid hormone (PTH)  |\n| Primary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism  |\n| Ectopic PTH secretion  |\n| Excess of Vitamin D： granulomatous disease (e.g.， sarcoidosis)  |\n| Excess of calcium intake：“milk-alkali” syndrome  |\n| Malignancies (e.g.， bone deposits， myeloma)  |\n| Drugs  |\n| Thiazide diuretics  |\n| Vitamin D and analogues  |\n| Miscelaneous  |\n| Immobility  |\n| Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia  |\n\n【31】of 1，25-dihydroxycholecalciferol， and increasing renal tubular reabsorption of calcium and excretion of phosphate. At the cellular level， PTH acts on cell membrane receptors， resulting in an increase of adenylate cyclase activity， with increased levels of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate(CAMP).\n\n【32】Vitamin D Metabolism\n\n【33】Dietary sources are not the primary source of vitamin D； instead， the primary source is the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholecalciferol by sun-light. Cholecalciferol is converted in the liver to 25-hydroxycholecalcif-erol， which subsequently is converted to 1，25-dihydroxycholecalciferol in the kidney. This is the biologically active form of vitamin D. 1，25-Dihydroxycholecalicferol is required for bone mineralization and also pro-motes calcium absorption from the gut.\n\n【34】Calcitonin\n\n【35】This is a 32-amino acid hormone produced by the parafollicular C cells in the thyroid. Calcitonin inhibits osteoclastic bone resorption and increases renal excretion of calcium and phosphate. The contribution of calcitonin to calcium metabolism is unclear. States of low calcitonin (total thyroidectomy) or high calcitonin (medullary carcinoma of the thyroid) does not result in altered calcium levels.\n\n【36】Table 47-2\n\n【37】SELECTED CAUSES OF HYPOCALCEMIA\n\n| Chronic renal failure (very common cause)  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Hypoparathyroidism  |  |\n| After thyroid or parathyroid surgery (usually transient)  |  |\n| Congenital deficiency (DiGeorge syndrome)  |  |\n| Idiopathic (autoimmune parathyroid disease)  |  |\n| Vitamin D deficiency  |  |\n|  | Parathyroid hormone resistance (also known as pseudohypoparathyroidism)  |\n|  | Drugs (those that inhibit osteoclasts， e.g.， calcitonin， bisphosphonates)  |\n| Miscellaneous  |  |\n| Acute pancreatitis  |  |\n\n【39】Hyperparathyroidism\n\n【40】Primary hyperparathyroidism is the most common cause of elevated PTH. Secondary hyperparathyroidism occurs as a physiologic compensa-tory hypertrophy of the parathyroid glands resulting from hypocalcemia. PTH levels are raised， but serum calcium is not elevated. Tertiary hyperparathy-roidism occurs after long-standing secondary hyperparathyroidism the parathyroid becomes autonomous and hyperactive， resulting in tertiary hyper-parathyroidism. This occurs most often in the setting of chronic renal failure.\n\n【41】Malignancies Resulting in Hypercalcemia\n\n【42】Hypercalcemia usually is due to bony metastases in certain tumors. Common examples of such tumors are malignant tumors of the lung and breast and myeloma. Cytokines and prostaglandins are thought to be liber-ated， resulting in bone resorption with subsequent hypercalcemia. Ectopic PTH secretion by tumors is rare. The tumor cells produce a PTH-related pro-tein that exhibits homology to PTH in the amino acid sequence.\n\n【43】Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia\n\n【44】This term is used for simultaneous or metachronous occurrence of endocrine tumors. These tumors typicaly are inherited as autosomal dominant. The underlying pathogenesis is thought to be the expression of recessive oncogenic mutations. See Table 47-3 for a listing of the MEN syndromes.\n\n【45】Table 47-3\n\n| MEN type 1  |\n| --- |\n| Parathyroid adenoma  |\n| Pituitary adenoma  |\n| Pancreatic islet cell tumor  |\n| MEN type 2A  |\n| Pheochromocytoma  |\n| Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid  |\n| Parathyroid hyperplasia  |\n| MEN type 2B  |\n| Pheochromocytoma  |\n| Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid  |\n| Marfanoid habitus with mucosal and visceral ganglioneuromas  |\n\n【47】The various types of hypoparathyroidism include primary hypoparathy-roidism and pseudohypoparathyroidism. All the forms are uncommon except transient hypoparathyroidism， which is seen after thyroid or parathy-roid surgery. Idiopathic hypoparathyroidism is an autoimmune condition. Pseudohypoparathyroidism is due to end-organ resistance to PTH. The patient has hypocalcemia， and PTH levels are elevated. Certain somatic features are part of this condition， including mental impairment， short stature， and short metacarpals. The term pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism refers to individ-uals who have the somatic features of pseudohypoparathyroidism but in whom calcium and PTH levels are normal.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was advised to obtain  删除换行1 cytology brushings, attempt to correct the obstruction and decompress the intrahepatic  删除换行1 ducts, but a stent could not be inserted.

She often has to sleep with several pillows at night and has frequent urination at night (nocturia). She has noticed that her ankles are more swollen than usual. Of note， she has run out of digoxin， which she takes to control her heart rate. On examination， she is noted to be slightly hypotensive with a blood pressure (BP) of 90/65 mm Hg.

She has run out of digoxin.\n\n【7】Fourth heart sound： Filling of the ventricle by atrial systole.\n\n【8】Reason this patient does not have an S ： She is in atrial fibrillation and has no atrial contraction.\n\n【9】Factors that affect stroke volume： Contractility， preload (ventricular end-diastolic pressure and ventricular diastolic compliance)， and afterload (aortic pressure).\n\n【10】Stimulation of muscarinic receptors： Decreases contractility in atria(parasympathetic system).\n\n【11】CLINICAL CORRELATION\n\n【12】This 62-year-old woman has symptoms of congestive heart failure： fatigue， pedal edema， dyspnea， and orthopnea (needing to sleep on pillows). There are many causes for congestive heart failure. In this patient， atrial fibrillation with irregular ventricular rhythm leads to inadequate ventricular filling and decreased stroke volume. The likely explanation in this case is running out of medication (digoxin). Other factors that can present as congestive heart failure include myocardial infarction and cardiomyopathy (decreased contractility) as well as valvular problems (aortic valve stenosis). Clinically， these patients pres-ent with symptoms of fluid “backing up”in the cardiovascular system. They often have pulmonary edema， peripheral edema， and increased jugular disten-tion. A chest x-ray will reveal bilateral pulmonary edema with cardiomegaly. An echocardiograph can be used to calculate the ejection fraction， a measure of contractility. The ejection fraction is the fraction of the end-diastolic volume ejected in each stroke volume (normal =55%). Treatment of congestive heart failure depends on the etiology， but usually diuretics are given to relieve some of the excess fluid and medications are given (digitalis) to increase the con-tractility of the heart and improve cardiac output. A patient with atrial fibrilla-tion would benefit from medications to decrease conduction through the atrioventricular (AV) node or cardioversion to convert heart rate back to normal sinus rhythm.\n\n【13】APPROACHTO PHYSIOLOGY OF CARDIAC MECHANICS\n\n【14】Objectives 删除换行1 1Describe excitation-contraction coupling in the heart.\nDescribe factors regulating the force of myocardial contractions.\n\n【15】Describe the cardiac cycle.\n\n【16】Definitions\n\n【17】Systole： The period of time during which the heart muscle is contracting.\n\n【18】Diastole： The period of time during which the heart muscle is relaxed.\n\n【19】Heart sounds： The sounds produced by turbulent flow within the heart and by vibrations induced in structures comprising the heart.\n\n【20】Contractility： The ability of a muscle to shorten and/or develop force that does not depend upon a change in initial fiber length or afterload.\n\n【21】DISCUSSION\n\n【22】Cardiac and skeletal muscles have many similarities； however， there are important differences. Both are striated muscles， are excitable， and are reg-ulated by calcium . However， cardiac muscle fibers are smaller than skeletal muscle fibers， and， unlike skeletal muscle fibers， cardiac muscle fibers branch and are electrically coupled to one another.\n\n【23】Excitation of myocardial cells results from the propagation of action poten-tials from nodal cells， conduction fibers， or adjacent myocardial cells through low-resistance membrane junctions. There are no neuromuscular junctions as is seen in skeletal muscle. As in skeletal muscle， the mediator between mem-brane action potentials (excitation) and contraction is calcium. However， in contrast to skeletal muscle， a significant amount of calcium enters the cell through sarcolemma calcium channels during the action potential. This increase in calcium permeability accounts in large part for the plateau phase of the myocardial action potential， and the calcium that enters triggers the release of additional calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The enter-ing and released calcium then binds to troponin C to initiate events that lead to contraction. Between action potentials， much of the calcium is taken back up into the sarcoplasmic reticulum by primary active transport. However， to main-tain calcium balance， some calcium exits the cell by a secondary active process located on the sarcolemma. Calcium exit is coupled to and driven by the entry of sodium down its electrochemical gradient. The entering sodium then is expelled by the sodium pump.\nThe force of contraction of cardiac muscle can vary from beat to beat as a result of two basic mechanisms inherent to cardiac muscle. The first is the length-tension (or force) relationship， also known as the Starling law of the 删除换行5 Muscle length 删除换行4 heart. A basic property of all muscles is that there is an optimal length for active force development. At lengths greater and less than this optimal length(L)， less active force will be developed 删除33：<u></u>. In vivo， this rela-tionship is not important for skeletal muscles because their lengths are restricted close to L. because of their attachment to tendons and bones. For the heart， however， the size of the chambers and hence the length of the cardiac muscle cells before systole will vary depending on the end-diastolic volume of blood. This volume in turn depends in large part on central venous pressure and the compliance of the ventricles. Under most conditions， myocardial cells operate at lengths at which an increase in end-diastolic muscle length leads to a more forceful contraction and a larger stroke volume. This helps balance venous return and cardiac output. The length-tension relationship may have both structural and biochemical bases. For active force to develop， myosin cross-bridges must interact with actin filaments. At L，the overlap of thick and thin filaments is such that every cross-bridge has easy access to actin (thin) fil-aments， allowing each one to develop force. At muscle lengths longer than L， some of the cross-bridges do not overlap thin filaments and thus cannot develop force. At muscle lengths less than L， the lateral distances over which the cross-bridges reach to attach to actin filaments is greater， and at very short lengths， thin filaments from one side can interfere with cross-bridge interac-tions on the other side. Biochemically， it appears that the calcium sensitivity of the actin-myosin interaction also is impaired at short muscle lengths. Thus， activation of the contractile machinery will be less.\n删除3：<u>Figure 11-1. Relationship of muscle force and muscle length. The active and passive characteristics are added to supply a composite.</u>\n\n【24】The second mechanism responsible for regulating the force of myocardial contraction is referred to as contractility. Changes in contractility alter the force of contraction at any given muscle length， as shown in Figure 11-2. An increase in contractility will result in greater force and a greater stroke volume 删除换行4 at any muscle length (chamber volume)， thus increasing the ejection fraction. A decrease in contractility will have the opposite effect. The mechanisms responsible for changes in contractility mostly involve calcium metabolism and include alterations in 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> calcium entry during the action potential， 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u>cal-cium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum， 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> calcium binding to troponin-C， 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> calcium uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum， and 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> calcium extrusion from the myocyte. Physiologically， changes in contractility result mainly from changes in sympathetic nerve activity. Activation of myocardial B-adrenergic receptors by norepinephrine and epinephrine results in stimula-tory G protein activation of adenylyl cyclase and resultant increases in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Increased cAMP activates protein kinase A to phosphorylate key proteins involved in many of the steps of calcium metabolism listed above. The result is greater activation of the myosin-actin interactions and greater force. In contrast， stimulation of muscarinic choliner-gic receptors by acetylcholine results in inhibitory G protein activation， inhi-bition of adenylyl cyclase activity， and less phosphorylation of the same proteins. This results in lesser activation of the myosin-actin interaction and less force.\n删除3：<u>Figure 11-2.

During the time marked A， atrial depolarization， as indicated by the P wave of the electrocardiograph (ECG)， leads to atrial con-traction (atrial systole) and complete ventricular filling. In some cases， the turbulence caused by this filling results in an audible fourth heart sound. During the time marked B， ventricular depolarization， as indicated by the QRS complex of the ECG， leads to a period of ventricular contraction during which ventricular pressure rises， closing the AV valves (producing the first heart sound)， but there is no ejection of blood into the aorta. This is the period\n\n【26】Time 删除换行4 of isovolumetric ventricular contraction. During the time marked C， ven-tricular pressure surpasses aortic pressure and there is rapid emptying of blood， as indicated by the decrease in ventricular volume and the increase in aortic pressure. This constitutes the rapid ventricular ejection phase of the cycle. During the time indicated by D， the ventricles are repolarizing， as indi-cated by the T wave of the ECG； the force of ventricular contraction is decreasing； and the flow of blood into the aorta slows. This is the reduced ventricular ejection phase. During the time indicated by E， the ventricles con-tinue to relax， and aortic pressure soon exceeds ventricular pressure. This results in closure of the aortic valve and the second heart sound. Ventricular pressure then falls with no change in volume. This is the isovolumetric ven-tricular relaxation phase. During the time indicated by F， ventricular pressure falls below venous pressure， the AV valve opens， and the ventricle begins to fill rapidly， as indicated by the increase in ventricular volume. This is the rapid ventricular filling phase that sometimes produces an audible third heart sound. The time indicated by G is the period of reduced ventricular filling that occurs before the next period of atrial systole.\n删除3：<u>Figure 11-3. Cardiac cycle.

The basic principles of Advanced  删除换行5 Trauma Life Support (ATLS) should be followed – Airway with cervical spine immobilisation, \n\n【14】Breathing and Circulation, in that order, should take priority over obtaining the CT head. As  删除换行1 a part of the primary survey, the patient’s Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score is assessed by  删除换行1 eliciting the best Eye (E), Verbal (V) and Motor (M) responses. In this example, the patient  删除换行1 scores an E1 V1 M1 at the scene, and E1 VT (intubated) M4 on arrival at the Trauma Centre.\nThe GCS is an objective and reproducible clinical tool to classify the severity of brain injury  删除换行1 and monitor for clinical deterioration and improvement. The motor component is important  删除换行1 as it helps predict long-term neurological outcome.\n\n【15】In this case, the patient’s CT scan of the head shows a hyperdense crescent-shaped area  删除换行1 beneath the skull, causing mass effect on the underlying brain parenchyma. There is also  删除换行1 midline shift and effacement of the lateral ventricle on the left. This is the classic appearance of an acute subdural haematoma (SDH). An acute SDH originates from venous bleeding, typically from dural bridging veins that sheer from the rapid acceleration–deceleration  删除换行1 movements experienced by the brain from trauma. Depending on the extent of the injury  删除换行1 and the amount of space in the cranial vault, the patient could remain neurologically stable  删除换行1 or could deteriorate as evidenced by a drop in the GCS and development of a motor deficit.\nBlood in the subdural space occupies the limited space inside the skull. In a normal individual, this space is filled primarily with brain matter. The brain is surrounded by cerebrospinal  删除换行1 fluid (CSF), which acts as a shock absorber to protect the brain against the hard (and often  删除换行1 rough) surface of the skull. Blood vessels travel into and out of the skull to supply the brain  删除换行1 with oxygen and nutrients while removing waste products. Pressure equilibrium in the fixed  删除换行1 cavity of the skull is maintained through the relationship of the volume of the brain matter,  删除换行5 CSF and blood in the skull. With the introduction of an additional compartment, in the form  删除换行1 of subdural blood, a number of events take place. CSF will be displaced out of the skull, and  删除换行1 occasionally, the outflow tract of the CSF could be compressed by brain matter, leading to  删除换行1 obstructive hydrocephalus. Blood vessels are compressed and therefore blood supply to the  删除换行1 brain is compromised. Finally, brain matter may herniate, manifesting as dilated pupils and  删除换行1 eventually respiratory arrest. This finely balanced relationship between the intracranial compartments is known as the Monro–Kellie doctrine.\n\n【16】The goal in these scenarios is to prevent secondary brain injury. Injury from the initial trauma  删除换行1 (primary brain injury) may have caused irreversible damage to some brain tissue. Secondary  删除换行1 brain injury can be prevented through prompt evaluation and treatment of trauma patients.\nOnce a diagnosis is confirmed through a non-contrast head CT, neurosurgical consultation  删除换行1 should be obtained. Depending on the local practice patterns, the neurosurgeon may or may  删除换行1 not be a part of the initial trauma team evaluating the patient on arrival. The decision to take  删除换行1 the patient to surgery for decompression is not straightforward and is often based on clinical  删除换行1 judgement and radiological findings. Several factors could be optimised in the early phases of  删除换行1 the patient’s encounter. These include early blood tests, including a full blood count, coagulation labs and a group and save in anticipation of operative interventions. Obtained early,  删除换行1 this will enable time for correction with products such as packed red blood cells, platelets,  删除换行1 vitamin K and prothrombin complex concentrate where indicated.\n\n【17】Occasionally, the patient either does not require emergent surgical decompression or is a  删除换行1 poor surgical candidate. Management of the acute SDH in these instances should follow  删除换行1 the basic principles of intracranial pressure (ICP) management. First tier strategies, such as 145\n\n【18】Case 40: Motor vehicle accident 删除换行1 raising the head of the bed or adopting a reverse Trendelenburg position for patients with  删除换行1 concomitant spinal injuries, ensuring unobstructed venous jugular outflow and maintaining  删除换行1 normothermia, should be employed initially. If indicated, an ICP monitor should be placed  删除换行1 to help guide resuscitation. At this point, patients will typically have a GCS < 8 and would  删除换行1 require intubation.\n\n【19】Cerebral oedema can be reduced by driving interstitial fluid into the cerebrovascular circulation and eventually out of the ‘fixed box’. Agents commonly employed include hypertonic  删除换行1 saline and mannitol. An intubated and ventilated patient comes with the benefit of being  删除换行1 able to control the pCO2 level through the ventilator to induce cerebro-vasoconstriction.\nDue to the risk of inadequate perfusion, this technique is controversial and should only be  删除换行1 used sparingly. Sedation and muscle paralytics can lower the metabolic demands of the body  删除换行1 and hence increase oxygen delivery to the brain. Hypothermia, which should theoretically  删除换行1 achieve similar goals, has been controversial and should be avoided due to the risk of coagulopathy. CSF diversion is often performed via the insertion of an external ventricular drain  删除换行1 (EVD), which carries the additional benefit of enabling ICP monitoring.\n\n【20】Key Points\n\n【21】• Always adhere to ATLS principles when assessing patients with head injury.\n\n【22】• Obtain a non-contrast CT head as soon as feasible when a subdural haemorrhage  删除换行1 is suspected.\n\n【23】• Intubate the patient if necessary, but obtain a good examination beforehand and  删除换行1 use short-acting and reversible medications to enable repeat examinations to  删除换行1 guide interventions.\n\n【24】• Remember that time is brain.删除9：<u>http://taylorandfrancis.com147</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

He is sitting there playing happily with one of his toys and you’re eating popcorn from a small bowl. The phone rings and you get up to find where you left your phone, leaving Jordan on the floor. While you’re up, Jordan becomes curious and he reaches into the bowl of popcorn and grabs a piece. He puts it into his mouth, just as he had seen you do, but he cannot chew it and it gets caught in the back of his throat. Jordan starts coughing, but the popcorn is really stuck and it’s not coming out. Meanwhile, you return with your phone to see him struggling, unable to breathe. You scream—your worst nightmare is coming true! You pick him up and start hitting his back to try to dislodge the piece of popcorn, but it’s not working. Jordan is not able to breathe. He is turning a bluish gray color because he can’t get any oxygen, and you see his eyes close. You’re in a panic now… heart racing, sweating, feeling dizzy. What’s happening!? Can this be it? Is Jordan going to die? Why did you leave him there with the popcorn? No one else is home and you’re completely overwhelmed with panic. All sorts of things race through your head as you try desperately to save your son. You’re holding Jordan’s lifeless body as you dial 911 and explain what’s happening. But the voice on the other end is saying it will take 15 minutes to get an ambulance to your house. You know that it will be too late. Jordan will be gone by then….\n\n【5】Jennifer read this scene into her smart phone and practiced listening to the recording for the remainder of the session. Rather than keeping track of subjective anxiety levels, the therapist kept track of Jennifer’s expectations of being able to tolerate thinking about this scene as well as the anxiety and the distress that it provoked. As the exposure began, Jennifer believed that she would only be able to “handle” thinking about this scene for a few minutes. But after a few minutes, she realized that she could manage it, despite the distress it provoked. After about 30 min of listening to the scene, Jennifer was able to articulate that although the thought was very distressing, she could think about it and recognized that the probability of such an event was acceptably low—although not zero. After about 40 min, the therapist left the office and allowed Jennifer to practice confronting the thought on her own. Again, Jennifer exceeded her expectations for tolerating the thought on her own. At the end of the session, Jennifer felt very good about completing the exercise and was instructed to practice the same task once each day between sessions. At the end of each treatment session, Jennifer chose an item from the exposure list to practice confronting during the next session (some of which included bringing Jordan to the session).\n\n【6】Jack’s Involvement in Treatment\n\n【7】Jack attended several exposure sessions in which the therapist taught him how to play the role of “coach” and offer emotional support to Jennifer as she completed exposure practices within and outside the sessions. Jack was also taught how to provide gentle, but firm reminders to Jennifer not to engage in avoidance or rituals. The emphasis was placed on helping Jennifer tolerate and “get through” the obsessional anxiety, as opposed to trying to immediately alleviate this distress. The therapist also helped Jennifer and Jack to use two types of communication skills when dealing with OCD-related matters between sessions. The first skill involved “sharing thoughts and feelings” or emotional expressiveness training (EET) in which the couple was taught to discuss with one another how they feel (as opposed to offering solutions) during exposure, while also listening effectively to each other. The second skill involved learning how to make decisions as a couple around choosing and implementing exposure tasks, and resisting rituals 删除10：<u>(Abramowitz et al. 2013 ; Epstein and Baucom 2002 )</u>.\n\n【8】Because Jennifer had a history of occasionally manipulating Jack into providing reassurance, the therapist explained the deleterious effects of such accommodation, noting that while well intended, “helping” Jennifer alleviate her anxiety by providing assurances served to maintain obsessional fear. Next, the therapist helped the couple develop a list of activities which had become hampered by OCD and then use the decision-making skills learned earlier to choose how to handle these situations by promoting the idea of exposure, rather than relying on avoidance and compulsive rituals. In other words, the couple was instructed in how to build ERP techniques into their everyday life and functioning as a couple. For example, Jennifer and Jack resumed sleeping in their own bedroom, and Jack stopped checking on Jordan whenever Jennifer had obsessional fears that he might not be safe in his crib. The therapist’s aim was to help Jennifer and Jack to work toward a life in which they confront the situations and stimuli that Jennifer had been avoiding in order to teach Jennifer how to tolerate anxiety and uncertainty.\n\n【9】Sessions 12–16\n\n【10】Over the course of the next month, Jennifer practiced CT and ERP. She quickly recognized how effective it was to confront her fears, rather than avoid, and diligently completed all in-session and homework assignments. She and Jack worked extremely well together and were able to reclaim the life they had before Jennifer’s anxiety had taken over. After 4 months of treatment, Jennifer reported that her depressive symptoms had improved greatly and her BDI score at session 16 was only 5 (an 82 % reduction in depressive symptoms). Moreover, she had resumed sharing with Jack the caretaking responsibilities for Jordan. She was no longer avoiding being alone with Jordan, and the couple was no longer arguing about OCD-related matters. Checking and reassurance-seeking behavior had almost disappeared, and although Jennifer occasionally experienced negative thoughts about Jordan, she was able to tolerate these and recognize that the risks of catastrophic consequences were acceptably low. Her YBOCS severity score at session 16 was 9 (a 67 % reduction in OCD symptoms). With input from both Jennifer and Jack, it was decided that for the next 3 months, Jennifer would see the therapist on a monthly basis for follow-up sessions. Jennifer continued to remain improved through this time, and treatment was therefore terminated.\n\n【11】Complicating Factors\n--------------------\n\n【12】### Religious Scrupulosity and Fear of Sin\n\n【13】In session 6, when Jennifer and her therapist first began applying CT techniques to her unwanted thoughts, Jennifer described that while these techniques made sense for challenging depressive thoughts, she was hesitant to apply what she had learned to her OCD symptoms. Specifically, she told her therapist that her Christian background had taught her that thoughts are morally equivalent to actions and that therefore thinking of something immoral was the same as committing an immoral act 删除10：<u>(i.e. moral thought–action fusion; Shafran et al. 1996 )</u>. She could recall several biblical passages that exemplified the importance of control over thoughts in order to avoid sin and punishment.\n\n【14】Jennifer and her therapist discussed the definition of sinful behavior. Jennifer said she had learned that a sin is something a person does that he or she (a) does deliberately, (b) knows is wrong, and (c) does not feel remorseful about. When Jennifer was asked to evaluate her intrusive thoughts against this definition, she recognized differences, but said that she could not be sure whether God was upset with her for having the thoughts she had. Thus, for Jennifer, the mere possibility that her obsessions meant that she is an immoral person and may do something to hurt her child, provoked high levels of anxiety and distress. They discussed how no one, including other practicing Christians, really knows for sure whether God is upset with them and therefore must accept such things on faith. It was explained that OCD had led Jennifer to essentially “lose her faith in faith.” Thus, the therapist framed the purpose of cognitive restructuring and exposure as helping Jennifer to become a more faithful Christian. This would involve exposure to external (actual stimuli and situations) and internal (i.e. thoughts) triggers of religious obsessions to give her opportunities to confront such stimuli and learn healthier and more productive responses to them. Jennifer said that this explanation made sense to her and that she was willing to give cognitive restructuring and exposure a try .\n\n【15】### Intolerance of a Partner’s Distress\n\n【16】While Jack seemed to understand the rationale for exposure and was able to adhere to the guidelines during in-session exposure practice, he described that it was difficult for him to resist providing reassurance when obsessional triggers would provoke Jennifer’s anxiety in their daily life. Jack said that in those moments (e.g. when Jennifer would call him at work asking him to calm her fears that she was developing schizophrenia), he knew that reassuring her was contrary to the treatment model, but that it felt wrong to withhold comfort from Jennifer when he knew what he needed to say in order for her to feel better. He also said he hated to see Jennifer feeling so distressed all the time and was even concerned that too much anxiety could harm Jennifer. The therapist reemphasized that although providing reassurance seemed like the right thing to do when Jennifer was very anxious, that this would only relieve Jennifer’s anxiety in the moment, and in the long-term it would fuel her OCD and keep her from learning to tolerate her obsessions and learn skills for managing these situations on her own. Furthermore, because accommodation had become the primary means by which Jack would express care and concern for Jennifer, the therapist helped the couple redefine the ways in which they showed affection and love for one another so that they continue to feel emotionally close while reducing accommodation. For example, Jack and Jennifer decided to have a weekly date night on Thursdays, now that Jennifer was feeling more and more capable of being away from Jordan, in order to focus on the two of them as a couple (outside of OCD). Jack said that these types of activities gave him the strength to resist accommodating Jennifer’s OCD because he felt like overall he was becoming a better partner.\n\n【17】Conclusions and Key Practice Points\n-----------------------------------\n\n【18】Jennifer’s case illustrates the use of CBT for OCD with comorbid depression. Table 25.3 highlights several key practice points we feel were important in the success of Jennifer’s course of therapy and are important to consider in the treatment of this comorbidity pattern. In particular, CT methods for depression and OCD symptoms were used to augment traditional ERP procedures. Given Jennifer’s helplessness and hopelessness at baseline, it is likely that she would have had difficulty with adherence (if not discontinued therapy altogether) if ERP had been begun immediately. Consequently, ERP was delayed to a point in treatment that is significantly later than in typical implementation. Instead, by the introduction of CT first, she had the opportunity (a) to establish rapport with her therapist, (b) to see that the therapist understood her OCD symptoms, (c) to understand her own symptoms better, and (d) to develop cognitive coping strategies to reduce her depressive symptoms and prepare for ERP exercises. It is interesting to speculate whether these factors contributed to her engagement in the more difficult aspects of the therapy. Indeed, some have advocated that CT strategies be used routinely to help patients confront feared situations during exposure 删除10：<u>(e.g. Kozak 1999 )</u>.\nTable 25.3 删除换行 Key practice points in the treatment of comorbid OCD and depression\n\n| Assess for the temporal nature of the relationship between OCD and depression |\n| --- |\n| Consider adding cognitive therapy for depression and OCD before starting with exposure and response prevention |\n| Consider involving a spouse, partner, or other support person in treatment |\n| Use an inhibitory learning approach to exposure and help the patient to learn fear tolerance, as opposed to relying on habituation of anxiety as an indicator of success |\n\n【20】Another important practice point was the inclusion of Jennifer’s husband, Jack, in treatment. The reestablishment of healthy ways of relating was viewed as important for (a) the reduction of accommodation behavior that maintained Jennifer’s OCD symptoms and (b) reducing Jennifer’s depression symptoms by alleviating the distress in her relationship with Jack.\n\n【21】Jennifer’s depression was quite straightforward and clearly secondary to her OCD. That is, she was primarily depressed about having obsessional thoughts about the very subject that was most important to her—her newborn baby. Very likely, the reduction in her OCD symptoms in the middle and later stages of treatment resulted in further improvements in her depression. It is likely that many patients with postpartum depression also experience obsessional thoughts and indeed OCD, but present with depressive complaints because postpartum OCD is less recognizable than postpartum depression 删除10：<u>(e.g. Fairbrother and Abramowitz 2007 )</u>. In some instances, however, patients’ depressive symptoms represent primary disorders, which transcend the distress associated with OCD. For example, one patient we evaluated had experienced depression for several years before the onset of her OCD. An important question is whether patients whose depressive symptoms are related to the distress or functional impairment associated with OCD would fare better in CBT for OCD when compared to patients for whom OCD and depression represent truly unrelated diagnoses.\n\n【22】In summary, although research demonstrates that ERP is the best available treatment for OCD, the presence of comorbid disorders may interfere with its strong effects. In particular, severely depressed OCD patients tend not to fare as well with ERP as do nondepressed patients. The introduction of CT techniques is one strategy that might improve depressed OCD patients’ response to exposure therapy. Given that SRI medications are effective in the treatment of OCD, pharmacotherapy might also be suggested in such cases.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Although genetically different from the moment of conception, male and female differentiation does not begin until around the eighth week of development, when the gonads secrete hormones that influence the development of either the paramesonephric ducts in the female or the mesonephric ducts in the male. In the absence of the testis-determining factor located on the Y chromosome, the mesonephric ducts begin to degenerate and form a matrix for the developing paramesonephric ducts. The paramesonephric ducts fuse at their inferior margin, forming the single lumen of the uterovaginal canal. Failure of complete fusion of these ducts can result in a bicornuate uterus, as shown in the image. This anatomic variation is associated with recurrent pregnancy loss.  \nAnswer A is incorrect. Complete failure of fusion of the paramesonephric (müllerian) ducts leads to uterus didelphys, in which there are two separate uterine cavities that each have a cervix and vagina.  \nAnswer B is incorrect. Failure of resorption of the midline uterine septum results in a septate or arcuate uterus.  \nAnswer C is incorrect. Diethylstilbestrol (DES) is a synthetic nonsteroidal estrogenic compound given to women in the mid-1900s for a variety of indications, including the prevention of spontaneous abortions in pregnant women. However, it was later found to be a teratogen, as it causes a variety of structural changes of the cervix of female fetuses in utero and predisposes them to adenocarcinoma of the vagina as young women.

Rapid clinical assessment is critical in case this patient is headed toward respiratory failure， perhaps necessitating endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. An ABG will quickly provide information regarding the adequacy of oxygenation status (Pao，) and ventilation (Paco，). A chest x-ray will determine the underlying status of the lung parenchyma and whether a trigger for the current situation can be identified.CHRONIC BRONCHITIS： COPD component that is diagnosed clinically and is characterized by excessive secretion of bronchial mucus and productive cough for3 months or more in at least 2 consecutive years in the absence of any other disease that might account for this symptom.\n\nCHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD)： Chronic air-flow obstruction caused by chronic bronchitis or emphysema.COPD is a prevent-able and treatable disease characterized by persistent airflow limitation that is usually progressive and associated with enhanced chronic inflammatory response in the lungs to noxious particles and gases. Diagnosis in the right clinical setting is usually supported by FEV /FVC ratio less than 0.7. Severity of COPD on spirom-etry is based on the level of FEV，/FVC ratio compared to the predicted value. The severity of airflow limitation can be classified based on postbronchodilator FEV.FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN 1 SECOND (FEV)： Volume of air expired in the first second during maximal expiratory effort. FEV is reduced in both obstructive lung disease (increased airway resistance) and restrictive lung dis-ease (low VC).| Table 15-1·CLASSIFICATION OF SEVERITY OF COPD BASED ON THE RESPONSE OF FEV TO BRONCHODILATORS  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Stage  | Severity  | FEV，(% predicted)  |\n| GOLD 1  | Mild  | \\>80%  |\n| GOLD 2  | Moderate  | 50%-79%  |\n| GOLD 3  | Severe  | 30%-49%  |\n| GOLD 4  | Very severe  | <30%  |\n\n【9】Abbreviations：FEV。 forced expiratory volume in 1 second； GOLD， Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease.The most common etiology for COPD is inhalation injury， specifically cigarette smoking. Another important cause is alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency， which is hered-itary； pulmonary disease may become evident by age 40 and may occur without cough or smoking history. Therapy by replacement of alpha-1 antitrypsin enzyme is available. Characteristically， patients with COPD present with progressively worsening dyspnea (first on exertion， then with activity， then at rest). Patients may vary in appearance from a\"blue bloater” (chronic bronchitis， overweight， edema-tous， cyanotic) to a\"pink puffer\" (emphysema， thin， ruddy cheeks).\n\n【10】Arterial blood gases often are normal in the early phase of the disease； however， in more advanced disease， there is evidence of hypoxemia and hypercapnia， often with a chronic compensated respiratory acidosis as a consequence of CO， reten-tion. Such chronic stable patients may have a Pao， near 50 mm Hg and a Paco， near 50 mm Hg， but a near-normal pH (the“50-50\" club). During an acute exac-erbation， more severe hypoxemia or hypercapnia， or respiratory acidosis noted on ABG， may be an indication of impending respiratory failure and need for ventila-tory support. Given an appropriate clinical context， general indications for measur-ing ABGs include low oxygen saturation on pulse oximetry (< 92%)， depressed level of consciousness， acute exacerbation， or assessment of hypercapnia in at-risk patients 30 to 60 minutes after supplemental oxygen is initiated.\n\nSpirometry is the most basic， inexpensive， widely valuable PFT to diagnose pulmonary diseases 删除33：<u></u>. Spirometric tracings of forced expiration删除33：<u></u> and flow-volume loops 删除33：<u></u> help to identify the type of lung disease (obstructive vs restrictive)， as well as potential reversibility of airflow obstruction. Restrictive lung diseases tend to have lower lung volumes (decreased TLC and VC)， whereas obstructive diseases have larger lung volumes (TLC normal or increased) with decreased expiratory flow rates (reduced FEV < 80% expected， and FEV，/FVC< 0.7). Specific parameters help to classify the type and degree of lung dysfunction . Reduced FEV /FVC with minimal response to bronchodilators is the hallmark of COPD.Figure 15-1.

Chance  删除换行1 in 1948. It consists of a compression injury to the anterior portion of the vertebral body  删除换行1 and a transverse fracture through the posterior elements of the vertebra and the posterior  删除换行1 portion of the vertebral body. It is caused by violent forward flexion, causing distraction  删除换行1 injury to the posterior elements.\nChance fractures later became known as ‘seatbelt’ fractures with the advent of lap seatbelts in cars.

The patient is bright red from head to toe. The patient has no systemic symptoms and vital signs are within normal. Due to the intensity of erythema, prior to initiating phototherapy, she is started on a “cool down” procedure with topical corticosteroids. Triamcinolone 0.1% ointment is applied liberally all over the body and occluded with plastic wrap. This application of topical steroids under occlusion is repeated daily for 2 weeks.\n\n【8】At this time, although the patient feels much more comfortable with less skin irritation and itching, the erythema remains with diffuse red and pink coloration over the entire body. The experienced phototherapy nurse is uncomfortable initiating even the lowest dose of NB-UVB for this patient since, in her experience, there is still substantial risk of light aggravating inflammation at this intensity of erythema.\n\n【9】Since the patient is relatively young and generally healthy, the decision is made to augment the cooling procedure with cyclosporine. After discussing the side effects and risk profile, two sets of blood tests, including creatinine, and blood pressure are checked at least 1 day apart and found to be within acceptable limits. Cyclosporine at the dose of 5 mg/kg per 24 h is then prescribed in BID divided doses.\n\n【10】On follow up 2 weeks later, the patient reports tolerating the cyclosporine well and denies side effects including gastrointestinal upset, headache, and paresthesia. Along with the continuation of the topical “cooling” regimen, the erythema has steadily decreased. On examination, the patient is only pink with no residual areas of bright redness. At this point, NB-UVB is started at a very low dose of 30 mJ/cm <sup>2 </sup> and increased by 10–30 mJ/cm <sup>2 </sup> as tolerated. With this regimen, the patient’s psoriasis significantly improves. On follow up a few months later, cyclosporine begins to be tapered off as NB-UVB is continued.\n\n【11】Discussion\n----------\n\n【12】Cyclosporine is one of the most powerful and quick acting therapeutic options when it comes to decreasing the intensity of skin inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. As discussed in Chap. 11 , “cooling down” severely inflamed skin is necessary prior to initiation phototherapy 删除33：<u></u>. When erythrodermic patients cannot be “cooled down” with topical corticosteroids alone, cyclosporine is an excellent option provided that the patient is generally healthy and does not have any contraindications to cyclosporine therapy including serious infection, immune suppression, and uncontrolled or severe hypertension 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Because cyclosporine is much less expensive than biologic agents, it is generally easier to access and can be initiated promptly. This is extremely advantageous in erythrodermic patients, as therapy should be started as soon as possible. Prior to starting cyclosporine, baseline laboratory tests should be performed which include complete blood count, liver function tests, serum bilirubin, magnesium, potassium, uric acid, lipids, blood urea nitrogen, and two sets of creatinine levels at least 24 h apart. Two sets of blood pressures should also be obtained at least 24 h apart. The diastolic blood pressure should consistently be 90 or less 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u> .\n\n【13】删除3：<u>Figure 19.1\n\n【14】A patent with erythrodermic psoriasis requiring cyclosporine “cool down” prior to initiation of phototherapy ( a before initiation of cyclosporine, b after cyclosporine “cool down”)</u>\nTable 19.1 删除换行 Pre-cyclosporine work up and laboratory assessments\n\n| Crucial | Important |\n| --- | --- |\n| Creatinine aBlood pressure (≤ 90 diastolic) a | Potassium levelMagnesium levelTriglyceridesLiver function testsUric acid |\n\n【16】<sup>a </sup> Obtain at least two values more than 24 h apart\n\n【17】In this case of erythrodermic psoriasis resistant to topical occlusive therapy, cyclosporine is key. However, the topical cooling regimen should still be continued since simultaneously therapy from both inside and outside is likely more efficacious than just doing one or the other. In addition, patients with intense skin inflammation sometimes experience uncomfortable skin irritation and tightening due to dryness on the surface of the skin. Because of this, liberal application of triamcinolone ointment should be continued not only for its anti-inflammatory effect but also to relieve symptoms maintain lubrication of the skin surface.\n\n【18】Providers may be concerned about the concomitant use of cyclosporine and phototherapy in the same patient. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does recommend against the combined use of cyclosporine and phototherapy due to the possibility of an increased risk of skin cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. This concern arises from the fact that phototherapy may increase the risk of skin cancer, and since cyclosporine is immunosuppressive, their combined use may increase this risk further. This is a reasonable concern for long-term combination especially in fair-skinned, Caucasian patients. However, it is a very different situation when cyclosporine is used for a short period of time to cool the skin down so that a very safe, long-term treatment such as UVB can be initiated. To date, there is no evidence showing increased risk of skin cancer with short-term use of cyclosporine (typically 1 to 2 months) according to dermatology guidelines concomitantly with phototherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. Some patients require several months of combined use of cyclosporine with phototherapy, but in the authors’ experience, increased risk of skin cancer in these patients has not been observed.\n\n【19】For this case, it is important to note that the cyclosporine that was prescribed to the patient was cyclosporine modified or Neoral. This is because only Neoral® is FDA-approved for use in psoriasis, not the old formulation Sandimmune. Sandimmune has unreliable and erratic absorption as compared to Neoral 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.

The defective enzyme is 21B-hydroxylase， an enzyme in the pathway that converts cholesterol into aldosterone and cortisol 删除33：<u></u>. This leads to excess substrates， which are shunted toward synthesis of sex hormones. Decreased cortisol leads to loss of feedback inhibition， increased adrenocorticotropic hormone， and further stimulation of the conversion of cholesterol into sex hormone precursors.\n\n【5】What are the likely findings on laboratory testing?\n\n【6】Hyponatremia and hyperkalemia are likely because mineralocorticoids (which are low in these patients) are responsible for the retention of sodium and the excretion of potassium. Salt wasting causes hypotension， which leads to activation of the renin-angiotensin system， resulting in elevated serum renin levels.\n\n【7】Is this an example of hermaphroditism or pseudohermaphroditism?\n\n【8】Pseudohermaphroditism is a condition in which an infant is born with the gonads of one sex and the external genitalia of the opposite sex (eg， normal female gonads but ambiguous， male-like external genitalia). True hermaphroditism (rare) occurs when the infant has both male and female gonadal tissue.\n\n【9】What is the appropriate treatment for this condition?\n\n【10】Treatment consists of replacement of the deficient hormones.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Lupus damages the kidneys by immune complex deposition – hence the low complement levels in  删除换行1 this patient, as they have been consumed. This can be observed with immunofluorescence  删除换行1 studies of glomerular tissue. In addition, the biopsy will give an indication of how much  删除换行1 of the disease is acute (and therefore reversible) and how much damage is chronic and  删除换行1 non-salvageable.\n\n【31】Treatment of lupus nephritis focuses on tight control of blood pressure with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and powerful immunosuppression. All  删除换行1 patients should receive high-dose steroids (up to 1 mg/kg) and either cyclophosphamide  删除换行1 or mycophenolate mofetil. Both drugs are effective in this situation; but, as this patient  删除换行1 is of child-bearing age, mycophenolate mofetil may be preferable as cyclophosphamide  删除换行1 has an adverse effect on fertility. If the patient fails to respond to treatment, anti-B-cell  删除换行1 therapy or plasma exchange are alternative therapeutic options.\n\n【32】KEY POINTS\n\n【33】• Renal disease is the most feared complication of SLE.\n\n【34】• Renal biopsy is used to guide treatment and aids prognostication.\n\n【35】• Most patients will require potent immunosuppression.\n\n【36】• Cyclophosphamide reduces fertility and this side-effect should be specifically discussed  删除换行1 with patients of child-bearing age.\n\n【37】删除29：<u>Rheumatology\n\n【38】</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

It accounts for 4% of all non-Hodgkin lymphoma cases. The pathogenesis of mycosis fungoides remains unclear. However, the role of genetic predisposition, environmental, occupational and infectious factors has been suggested. The condition is most common in adults over 50 years of age. A male predominance is observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The clinical presentation of mycosis fungoides varies with the stage of the disease. In the earliest, patchy stage, single or multiple, various in diameter, erythematous, or brownish scaly patches are localized most commonly on the gluteal region and proximal thighs. The plaque stage is characterized by the presence of annular or horseshoe-shaped lesions with an infiltrated base, raised, well-defined edges and asymmetrical distribution. The face and scalp may be also affected. In the tumor stage, erythematous-purplish papules or nodules of larger diameter are observed. Less common clinical variants of mycosis fungoides include bullous, purpuric, poikilodermatous, hypopigmented, follicular and Pagetoid reticulosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The hair loss is observed in 2.5% of patients with mycosis fungoides. It is more common in women compared to men. Hair loss in the course of mycosis fungoides is mainly patchy (84%). However, alopecia totalis or universalis may occur. Hair loss in patients with mycosis fungoides is characterized by two clinical patterns. In same patients, areas of hair loss with normal skin or mild erythema and scaling are observed. In others, hair loss is associated with patchy, plaque or follicular lesions. Diagnosis of mycosis fungoides requires a combination of clinical, pathologic, and molecular features. In histopathological examination, superficial lymphoid infiltrate, epidermotropism and lymphoid atypia are the predominant features. In immunohistochemical examination, decreased expression of CD2+,CD3+ (<50%), and CD7+ (<10%) T cells is characteristic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 3 \\]</u>. Dermoscopy may be useful to establish initial diagnosis. Dermoscopic features of mycosis fungoides are white-pinkish structureless areas, orange-yellowish patchy areas, dotted and linear irregular vessels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. Moreover, in trichoscopy, pili torti, eight-shaped hairs, thick white interfollicular bands, color heterogeneity of the background and perifollicular arrangement of vessels are observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Treatment of mycosis fungoides depends on the disease’s stage. In early-stages, topical corticosteroids, topical nitrogen mustards, topical bexarotene, imiquimod, psoralen-ultraviolet therapy or ultraviolet B therapy are usually recommended. Local radiation and total skin electron beam therapy may be also useful. For more extensive disease, combinations of skin-directed therapies and systemic therapies are used. The various systemic options available include retinoids, methotrexate, interferons, targeted immunotherapy and polychemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】The scalp involvement in mycosis fungoides should be differentiated with psoriasis, contact dermatitis and seborrheic dermatitis.\n\n【32】Seborrheic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory dermatologic condition. It presents as well-delimited erythematous plaques with greasy-looking, yellowish scale. Itching sensation is usually presented 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Seborrheic dermatitis is characterized by a seasonal pattern, presenting more frequently during winter, and improving usually during summer. Hair loss is rarely presented 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【33】Allergic contact dermatitis is an inflammatory eczematous skin disease. The disease is rarely presented on the scalp area, because of the great thickness of the epidermis in this region. In the case of application of irritants or allergens on the scalp symptoms are usually observed on the face or neck area. Clinically, contact dermatitis presents as erythema with scaling and coexisted itch. In acute disease, vesicles or pustules may be present. Hair loss is rarely observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【34】Scalp psoriasis is characterized by red, thickened plaques with silver-white scale, either contained within the hairline, or extending onto the forehead, ears, and posterior neck. In many cases, severe itch occurs. Hair loss is rarely observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【35】In the presented patient, the diagnosis of mycosis fungoides was established.

She is also unable to lift her arms and  删除换行1 her head keeps drooping. These symptoms appeared after a recent chest infection. Last  删除换行1 year she had visited her GP because of double vision that worsened with reading and  删除换行1 with intermittent weakness. She also noted difficulty in talking after prolonged speech.\nHowever, symptoms were mild and occasional only and no treatment was required. She  删除换行1 has no medical history, is not on medications and is generally fit and well.\n\n【3】Examination\n\n【4】This woman looks fatigued and has droopy eyelids. She breathes quickly and shallowly. A neurological examination reveales proximal muscle weakness and bilateral  删除换行1 mild ptosis but no muscle wasting or abnormal reflexes. The rest of the cardiovascular,  删除换行1 respiratory and abdominal examination is unremarkable. Observations: blood pressure  删除换行1 127/62 mmHg, heart rate 62/min, respiratory rate 28/min.\n\n【5】Questions\n\n【6】• What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【7】• How would you manage this patient?\nANSWER 32\n\n【8】This woman has dysphagia, respiratory distress and generalized weakness. In the context  删除换行1 of earlier intermittent symptoms of fatiguable muscular weakness affecting speech and  删除换行1 vision, she is likely to suffer from myasthenia gravis and now presents in a myasthenic  删除换行1 crisis. A crisis is often provoked within the first two years of diagnosis and is precipitated  删除换行1 by infections, aspiration or drugs.\nMyasthenia gravis (MG) is a chronic autoimmune disorder affecting the neuromuscular  删除换行1 junction of skeletal muscles. Antibodies against the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor cause  删除换行1 destruction of the post-synaptic membrane. Hence skeletal muscle weakness occurs. MG  删除换行5 can affect just the ocular muscles or also can involve other muscle groups such as limb  删除换行1 and axial muscles or oropharyngeal and respiratory muscles. Muscle weakness can be  删除换行1 graded as mild to severe. Severe muscle weakness of the oropharyngeal and respiratory  删除换行1 groups can compromise the airway. Infection can worsen MG.\n\n【9】Tests to confirm MG include serum anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody; if this is negative, anti-muscle tyrosine kinase antibody is commonly present. If antibodies are negative, repetitive nerve testing can be performed to demonstrate a successive decrement  删除换行1 in action potentials. A CT chest is performed in newly diagnosed cases to rule out an  删除换行1 associated thymoma. The major differential is LEMS; however, in this case the history  删除换行1 points towards MG and there are no autonomic features. LEMS is also usually associated  删除换行1 with an underlying malignancy or with anti-VGCC antibodies in those without cancer.\nOther myopathies can present with muscle weakness, but they are not fatiguable – which  删除换行1 is characteristic of MG.\n\n【10】This woman has a myasthenic crisis precipitated by pneumonia and is at risk of respiratory failure. Her forced vital capacity (FVC) should be measured: an FVC of 15 mL/kg  删除换行1 or less would suggest the need for mechanical ventilator support. To reverse the process  删除换行1 she will need either intravenous immunoglobulin or plasma exchange. Even if she does  删除换行1 not require intubation she should be closely monitored by serial FVC and treated in an  删除换行1 intensive-care setting where intubation can be performed.\n\n【11】Once she has responded to acute treatment, pyridostigmine is required in the long term.\nSome patients with severe MG require regular intermittent intravenous immunoglobulin  删除换行1 therapy every month. Other immunosuppressant therapy (e.g. prednisolone, azathioprine,  删除换行1 ciclosporin) may be needed for maintenance treatment.\n\n【12】KEY POINTS\n\n【13】• Myasthenia crisis can be precipitated by infection, aspiration, trauma, drugs, surgery or  删除换行1 pregnancy.\n\n【14】• Myasthenia gravis presenting with oropharyngeal weakness or shortness of breath  删除换行1 should alert you to potential respiratory compromise.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

This woman may indeed have a urinary tract infection； however， her vital signs are unstable. The mainstay of treatment in emergency medicine is to first address the patient airway， breathing， and circulation (ABCs). This patient is hypotensive (eg， BP 83/38 mm Hg). The first step in her management is placing an IV line and administering fluids. She should also be placed on a cardiac monitor to monitor her blood pressure， heart rate， and rhythm. Once her ABCs are addressed， laboratory studies should be obtained， including a urinalysis and culture. She should also receive broad-spectrum antibiotics and an antipyretic. This patient may need a lumbar puncture， but not until her ABCs are addressed. This patient requires admission to the hospital.\n\n【29】53.2 B. E coli is the infecting organism in more than 80% of all UTIs. All of the other choices cause urinary tract infections， but are less common.S saprophyti-cus is a common organism in young， sexually active women. In hospitalized or nursing home patients， Pseudomonas spp and Staphylococcus spp are frequent pathogens. Lactobacilli are normal urethral flora and are not considered a causative organism. Complicated UTIs are more likely to be caused by other organisms.\n\n【30】53.3 E. The patient is pregnant and has evidence of a urinary tract infection on the urinalysis. Pregnant patients are at high risk for preterm labor and perinatal mortality if a urinary infection goes untreated. Therefore， this patient should receive a 5 to 7 days course of nitrofurantoin or a penicillin-based antibiotic and follow-up with her obstetrician. The patient does not need to be admit-ted to the hospital for intravenous antibiotics. This would likely be the case if she were diagnosed with pyelonephritis. The patient should not wait for culture results and delay receiving her antibiotics. It is important to eradicate the bacteriuria as quickly as possible. This patient does not report the symp-toms of gonorrhea or Chlamydia (eg， vaginal discharge) at this time， and does not require further evaluation for these conditions. Fluoroquinolones (eg， ciprofloxacin) are contraindicated in pregnant patients due to the risk of fetal abnormalities (eg， tendon maldevelopment).\n\n【31】53.4 D. Men with urinary tract infections automatically fit into the “complicated”variety of UTIs. Therefore， the most appropriate therapy is ciprofloxacin for14 days. With the exception of amoxicillin as monotherapy， all of the above choices are appropriate for treatment of certain types of UTIs. Complicated UTIs mandate 14 days of therapy with an appropriate antibiotic. The emer-gency physician should also consider sending urine cultures on this patient and provide good follow-up. Patients with benign prostatic hypertrophy or other lower urinary tract obstructions may be discharged with a Foley catheter if they have good follow-up， understand how to manage their catheter， and have to significant medical comorbidities.\n\n【32】53.5 D.

Then, it evolved to the meaning of weapon and reshaped into “  ” (yì). The new character can denote “   ” (nú yì, enslavement), “  ” (bīng yì, military service), “  ” (láo yì, hard labor), etc. having the meaning of “to make human beings suffer”. “  ”, is actually formed by “  ” plus the “  ” omitting the radical of “  ” (chì, weapon), signifying “to make human beings suffer from disease”. This kind of disease causing a multitude of suffering is named “  ” (yì bìng, epidemic diseases), its characteristics concluded by the ancients as being “prone to spread wildly among people of all ages, causing similar symptoms”. Due to its sudden onset and rapid development, which can lead to sudden death, “  ” often combines with “  ” (lì, fierce disease) to express fierce epidemic disease or fierce pestilence. Some epidemics are called “  ”(wēn yì, plagues), implying most of them have heat in nature.\n\n【4】### Discussion on “  ” (Toxin)\n\n【5】Shuowen Jiezi , the ancient book also known as the Origin of Chinese Characters , has mentioned that “toxin 通用删除7(英):<u>(  )</u> is from excessiveness and harmful grass”. It can be seen that the early “  ” (dú, toxin) refers to the wild grass that grows luxuriantly in crops and is harmful to people, but the deviation properties and toxicity of these weeds can correct the bias of the diseased body. So, “  ” (dú cǎo, poisonous grass) refers to the medicinal herbs in fact. For example, Huangdi Neijing , the Inner Canon of Yellow Emperor , stated, “In high level toxicity treatment, cease the medication at level of six tenths health improvement; in general toxicity treatment, cease the medication at seven tenths health improvement.” On the contrary, “poisonous grass” can truly bring damage to a healthy organism. The so-called “harmful grass” is a “  ” (dú wù, toxicant) in a sense, whose meaning is then extended to the pathogenic factors causing body damage, called “  ”.\n\n【6】As the pathogenic factor, “  ” has three connotations.\n\n【7】通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Wang Bing notes in “ Plain Questions — Chapter 70 — Five Elements Theory Rectification Essay” that “toxins are all the formidable violent Qi from the five elements”. The six exogenous pathogenic factors can turn into toxin, such as wind toxin, cold toxin, heat toxin, and dampness toxin.\n\n【8】通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> You Yi’s Golden Chamber Heart Code states, “toxin is the accumulation of evil Qi that is hard to be removed from the body”. It means the accumulation of evil Qi (pathogenic factors) for a lengthy time can also form toxin inside the body, such as fire toxin, stasis toxin, phlegm toxin, and turbid toxin.\n\n【9】通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> Wu You-ke’s Treatise on Plague Diseases points out, “plagues are not caused by pathogenic wind, pathogenic cold, summer-heat, nor pathogenic damp, but an exotic Qi from between heaven and earth (the nature).” In other words, there is in nature a pathogenic factor, which causes sudden onset of disease, rapid development, high infectivity, insidiousness, and certain specificity. Wu called it “miscellaneous Qi”, or “the harmful Qi of heaven and earth”, that is, pestilent toxin. The nature of the pestilent toxins varies and the resulting damages vary.\n\n【10】Pestilent toxin attacking the external meridian, skins, and flesh can lead to focal redness, swelling, heat and pain, spot rash, or ulceration. It invades into the internal Zang and Fu (viscera, including Five Viscera and Six Bowels), marrow, and brain, and to a large extent can cause severe conditions, like high fever and coma.\n\n【11】COVID-19 is a “dampness-plague”, and it is a “plague” first and foremost. The onset of illness is induced by toxin. This type of plague has a similar attribute to “dampness”, but it is not a “dampness evil” (dampness toxin) at all. Although the toxic nature of fire and heat is commonly seen in the COVID-19, as Yu Lin implies, “the pestilence is known as toxin, as explicit as fire also”, and pestilence is absolutely not limited to fire toxin and heat toxin. “Clearing heat detoxification” is not the only method to remove toxin. There are other ways including relaxing bowels and purgation detoxification, releasing the exterior with diaphoresis detoxification, invigorating blood and cooling the blood detoxification, and resolving phlegm and dispersing knots (coagulation) detoxification. Besides, there is a more specific “combat toxin with toxin” method, which involves application of toxic drugs including animal drugs She (snake) and Xie (scorpion), botanical drugs Ban Xia (Pinellia Ternata) and Tian Nan Xing (Rhizoma Arisaematis), and mineral drugs Xiong Huang (realgar) and Zhu Sha (cinnabar). As for the treatment of pestilence, as Yu Jia-yan said, “once the evil (Qi) enters the body, the first priority of treatment is expelling turbidity (toxin)”. The expelling turbidity detoxification of COVID-19 is a solution to cope with the dampness nature of this kind of pestilent toxin, which can be fulfilled by dispersing dampness using acrid herbs, resolving dampness using fragrant herbs, drying dampness using bitter herbs, or draining dampness using bland herbs.\n\n【12】### Note on “  ” (Colds) 删除换行1 “  ” (gǎn), a verb, means “feel” or “touch”; “  ” (mào), a verb, means “offend” or “suffer”. “  ” (gǎn mào, Colds) forms a fixed phrase in Chinese, which is a noun, meaning feeling sick or being offended by the external evil Qi. Later, the meaning of the phrase narrowed, and it now means upper respiratory tract infection with viral nasopharyngitis as the main manifestation. In order to distinguish with influenza, “  ” is also known as “common cold”, or “  ” (shāng fōng, be hurt by wind/the sniffles) in terms of Chinese medicine.\n\n【13】The noun “common cold” was first used during the Song Dynasty: Shengji Zonglu (the “General Records of Holy Universal Relief”) Volume 156, “ ， (cold evil Qi that offends pregnant women, can hide under the skin)”; Volume 163, “ 。 (Postpartum women are deficient in Qi and blood, while their Cou Li (skin and muscular interstices) are open. If they are exposed to cold evil, it will invade their lung meridians, impeding the airway)”. “  ” here is still used as a verb. In the Heji Jufang (the “Prescriptions of the Bureau of Taiping People’s Welfare Pharmacy”), under the introduction of Rensheng Yangrong formula, “ ， (ancient physicians dared not treat most of the colds by diaphoresis easily)”, “  ” was used as the name of a disease for the first time.\n\n【14】Colds as exogenous febrile disease can be divided into three categories: seasonal cold, seasonal epidemic cold, and pestilent cold.\n\n【15】通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Seasonal cold: People who do poorly in maintaining their health catch cold when they come across the six exogenous pathogenic factors of the four seasons. This is the pathogenesis of the seasonal cold, “common cold”, or “the sniffles” cold. The main cause of disease is human error (improper self-health care); the secondary cause is the change of external climate Qi (pathogenic factors).\n\n【16】通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> Seasonal epidemic cold: Chinese medicine believes it is caused by the “year-season discord”. It means the confusion of the time-qi relationship: “the time of season is not yet to come, but the corresponding climatic Qi has come; the time has come, but the Qi is absent; it is the time, while the Qi is exceeding; the time has come, but the previous Qi still stays.” In addition, people can have seasonal epidemic cold when affected by the epidemic Qi during an outbreak. Therefore, the disorder of climatic Qi and the presence of epidemic Qi are the main causes of the disease, and people feeling the cold becomes the secondary cause. One of the representative diseases is seasonal influenza. The cold is also named “seasonal pestilence”.\n\n【17】通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> Pestilent cold: The “  ” (tiān, sky) is vast, hazy, mysterious, and unpredictable; “  ” (xíng, walk) here means prevalence. As a result, the so-called “  ” (tiān xíng, sky prevalence) refers to a kind of furtive infectious diseases, which is unpredictable, hard to trace, offending people with no distinction between old and young, and has an instant onset. Examples are COVID-19, SARS, avian influenza, and so on. Two points can be explained as follows: ① “Sky prevalence” also has certain seasonal characteristics. For example, the three infectious diseases mentioned earlier occurred in the late winter and early spring periods. The relevant pestilent toxins of these plagues thus have characteristics of the seasonally climatic Qi of those periods. ② “Sky prevalence” is not impossible to prevent; “Plain Questions” Chapter “Cifa Lun (discussion on acupuncture methods)” has stated as much very objectively and comprehensively. First, it attaches importance to the infectivity of the “sky prevalence” plague: “the five pestilences are easy to infect people, regardless of the ages, and the disease conditions are similar”; second, it stresses the prevention of the “sky prevalence” plague. The first step to prevention is by virtue of appropriate protection measures, “to avoid toxin Qi (pathogenic Qi)”; the second step is “keeping sufficient healthy Qi so that the pathogenic Qi cannot invade the body”.\n\n【18】### Explanation of “  ” (Moyuan)\n\n【19】The phrase “  ” (mó yuán, interpleural-diaphramatic space) comes from Plain Questions (a fascicle of Huangdi Neijing ), Chapter Nue Lun (Discussion on Malaria): “Malaria attack once the other day is caused by pathogenic Qi that approaches to the Five-Zang organs and transversely reaches Muyuan 通用删除7(英):<u>(  )</u>. Since the pathogenic Qi moves along a long route, penetrates deep inside and advances slowly, it cannot flow and emerge together with the Weiqi (defensive Qi). That is why it attacks once the other day”. Plain Questions, Chapter Jutong Lun (Discussion on Pains), also contains the following phrase: “retention of pathogenic cold between the intestines and the stomach and below Moyuan leads to stagnation of blood and contraction of small collaterals, resulting in pain. When pressed, blood and Qi disperse. That is why the pain stops when pressed.” Wang Bing notes that “‘  ’, is the membrane in between the thoracic cavity and diaphragm; ‘  ’, is the field in between the heart and the diaphragm.” The Japanese Danboyuanjian interpreted “  ” in “Plain Questions Knowledge”: “the membrane “  ” originally take the meaning of “  ”(mù, cover fabric of curtain) from “  ” (wéi mù, curtain/tent). It is a thin film among the membrane, covering on the diaphragm to block turbid Qi (evil Qi), like a cover fabric of curtain. So it is called “  ”, written as “  ” due to the radical of flesh.” “  ” is the phonetic loan character to “  ”; they have the same meaning in “  ” and “  ”.\n\n【20】The Treatise on Plague Diseases of Wu Youke indicates that “after the evil enters through mouth and nose, it won’t stay at the inner Zang-Fu organs, nor the outer meridians. It will stay in a region which is anterior to the spine, not far from the exterior, near the stomach, and the boundary of exterior and interior. That is, the semi-exterior-interior (in between exterior and interior), or the ‘Moyuan’ recorded in the ‘Needle Classic’, which the evil transversely reaches. In terms of the location where evil stays, the meridian is considered exterior of the body, and stomach is considered interior of the body. Therefore, the Moyuan, being the connection of the meridian and stomach, is considered semi-exterior-interior of the body.” Since Wu cited the concept of “Moyuan” in Huangdi Neijing to explain the plague, the theory of Moyuan had attracted the attention of TCM physicians. By summarizing the opinions among experts of Traditional Chinese medicine, the Moyuan theory contains the following content: 删除换行1 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> The site where evil stays: the Moyuan is located at the semi-exterior-interior, the junction of the inside and the outside, which is inside the defensive exterior (skin) and muscle striae (muscle), and outside the five Zang (Five Viscera) and six Fu (Six Bowels/six hollow organs). It can externally lead to the muscle striae, and internally approach the stomach-Fu organ. It is governed by the Hand-Shaoyang Meridian (Hand-Shaoyang Sanjiao Meridian). Moyuan is the crucial point and portal for the Sanjiao (triple jiaos in the body, including upper-jiao, middle-jiao, and lower-jiao).\n\n【21】通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> Physiology: Because the Moyuan is involved in many parts throughout the body (exterior and interior), the ancients believed that the Moyuan is related to the operation of the Sanjiao Qi movement. It is not only the way through which the external evil invades the body but also the path through which the body excretes internal evil. If the healthy Qi (vital energy) is weak, the external evil (pathogenic factor) will often enter through the Moyuan, and then invade the internal Zang-Fu viscera; if the healthy Qi is restored, the Qi will drum evil out through the Moyuan.\n\n【22】通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> Pathology: The “toxin incubating in Moyuan” syndrome emerges when turbid damp-heat enters the body through the nose and mouth and accumulates in the semi-exterior and semi-interior region where it grows resilient and very hard to resolve, combatting the healthy Qi, causing blockage of Qi and blood flow, and disruption of the Qi activity of the Sanjiao. It is a complex of syndromes involving the syndrome of intensive damp-heat accumulating in the middle-Jiao, as well as the Taiyang syndrome where pathogenic heat floats up, and the Shaoyang syndrome.\n\n【23】通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> Treatment difficulties: Neither diaphoresis for exterior syndromes nor purgation for interior syndromes can be used in treating the accumulation of turbid damp-heat. Eliminating the combination of dampness and heat is like extracting oil after mixing it with flour. Dampness cannot be resolved without the application of acrid herbs, but simply using acrid herbs could generate heat. Heat cannot be cleared without the application of bitter herbs, but simply using bitter herbs could generate dampness by interrupting the activity of the spleen and stomach. Therefore, the syndrome should not be treated merely by a single formula, a single method, or a single herb.\n\n【24】通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> Therapeutic principle: Expelling the evil is the general principle in treating the syndrome of “toxin incubating in Moyuan”. “  ” (kāi dá mó yuán, dredging the Moyuan), “  ” (Dayuan) for short, is actually the treatment combining diffusing the upper-jiao, dredging the middle-jiao, and unblocking the lower-jiao. Harmonizing the Sanjiao is to smooth the Shaoyang Sanjiao Meridian Qi movement, thus promoting circulation and distribution of Qi and blood. Overall, the ultimate purpose of the treatment is to expel the evil, which can be achieved by either discharging the evil Qi internally through urination and defecation, or dispelling it externally through sweating.\n\n【25】通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u> Treatment prescription: Dayuan Drink has the function of dispersing pathogens externally, promoting toxin excretion, and resolving turbid evil. In the formula, Bing Lang (arecae semen), Hou Po (magnoliae officinalis cortex), and Cao Guo (tsaoko fructus) are pungent and bitter in taste and warm in nature, which are capable of dispersing and descending, promoting Qi flow, and drying dampness. Bing Lang (arecae semen) can break the coagulations, dredging the channels and guiding Qi downward; Hou Po (magnoliae officinalis cortex) can break the coagulations and guide Qi downward, as well as dry dampness and resolve turbid evil; and Cao Guo (tsaoko fructus) has a strong pungent flavor, allowing it to outthrust and disperse the turbid toxin.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

At first, he was able to get up and limp and he  删除换行1 continued to play football for another 10 minutes when, because of the pain, he was replaced.\nWith rest, his pain settled; his team won and they had a big party that night. The next day,  删除换行1 he was suffering more pain but his coach dismissed his pain as cramps. Later that night, he  删除换行1 was admitted to hospital. The doctor injected some dye into his foot and x-rayed his leg. The  删除换行1 student was told he had a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and was started on injections to thin  删除换行1 his blood. Three days later, he was discharged on crutches and given syringes containing  删除换行1 the blood-thinning medication. The student had managed his first days well on crutches.\nHowever, yesterday he had fallen several times on the stairs of his parent’s house. Today while  删除换行1 walking on crutches, he had fallen unprovoked.\n\n【3】Examination\n\n【4】The GP finds good foot pulses and a bruise over the outside of the ankle with tenderness  删除换行1 stressing the lateral ligaments. There is deep tenderness over the outer upper aspect of the  删除换行1 shin and the anterior muscles, and the student reports worsening of the pain in this area on  删除换行1 walking. No losses in sensation are found, but the student remembers severe pins and needles  删除换行1 over the area of tenderness initially. There is weakness when trying to pull the foot upwards  删除换行1 against resistance and pain when the foot and toes are bent downwards.\n\n【5】Questions\n\n【6】• What is the diagnosis?\n\n【7】• Is contrast venography the appropriate investigation?\n\n【8】• How would you manage this patient?\n\n【9】• What is the prognosis for the student?\n\n【10】ANSWER 40\n\n【11】The student is suffering from subacute anterior compartment syndrome. This condition is characterized by the six P’s: ‘pain’, ‘pallor’, ‘paraesthesia’, ‘pulselessness’, ‘paralysis’  删除换行1 and ‘pressure’ on passive extension of the compartment. Our student reported pain early.\nCharacteristically, the pain is deep and constant, is poorly localized, seems out of proportion  删除换行1 to the severity of the injury and can be aggravated by passive stretching of the muscle group  删除换行1 involved. Paraesthesia of the affected cutaneous nerves is another typical sign. The pulse can  删除换行1 be found as long as the arterial pressure is higher than the pressure causing the compartment  删除换行1 syndrome. Paralysis sets in later: in this patient it took a week to develop.\n\n【12】Acute anterior compartment syndrome is caused by trauma of a limb causing bleeding and  删除换行1 swelling inside the muscle compartment and is a surgical emergency. Chronic compartment  删除换行1 syndrome is caused by over-usage of a muscle group causing the muscle to overdevelop and  删除换行1 put pressure on the surrounding sheath and can be seen in athletes.\n\n【13】The admitting doctor suspected a DVT. The Well’s Score and the D-dimer blood test would  删除换行1 have both militated against this diagnosis. Contrast venography has been considered the gold  删除换行1 standard in diagnosing the condition, but has been superseded by Doppler ultrasound, which  删除换行1 has become the standard imaging procedure. It is of no surprise that the venogram showed  删除换行1 a positive finding as the pressure rise in the muscle compartment diminishes venous return.\nThe admitting doctor made a common diagnostic error by closing the diagnostic enquiry too  删除换行1 early. The history and clinical signs and symptoms of the football injury did not fit the diagnosis of a DVT: the pain was too severe for the underlying injury and patients with venous  删除换行1 symptoms do not develop paraesthesia or paralysis. The positive imaging result seemed to  删除换行1 confirm the misdiagnosis and the doctor initiated the wrong treatment: anticoagulation  删除换行1 might actually have worsened the condition.\n\n【14】The student should be told to rest the leg, elevate it and cool it with ice to reduce the swelling and be given a non-steroidal analgesic to reduce the pain. As the pain is already greatly  删除换行1 reduced since the time of admission, surgical treatment is probably unnecessary. However, it  删除换行1 would be wise to phone an orthopaedic consultant to discuss the management. The anticoagulation treatment should be stopped. The majority of patients with subacute and chronic  删除换行1 compartment syndrome regain normal muscle function after paralysis. After the initial rest  删除换行1 period, they need to be encouraged to do muscle strengthening exercises. Patients with acute  删除换行1 compartment syndrome might lose function permanently if urgent surgical treatment is  删除换行1 delayed.\n\n【15】• Closing a diagnostic enquiry early by ignoring certain signs and symptoms may  删除换行1 lead to misdiagnosis. In the aforementioned case, the initiated test falsely confirmed the misdiagnosis.\n\n【16】• A positive test result might have other causes than the expected.\n\n【17】• If you are faced with additional signs that do not fit the working diagnosis, restart  删除换行1 your diagnostic enquiry.\n删除12：<u>Key Points83\n\n【18】删除29：<u>Case 41: Genetic Disorder</u>\n\n【19】</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Although relatively common, the individual practitioner will likely not become an expert in HFrEF diagnosis. Clinical diagnosis can present a major challenge as patients may exhibit a variety of signs and symptoms, many of which are not specific to HF. Patients with HF often have several comorbid conditions, further complicating the clinical presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. Additionally, individuals not typically thought to be predisposed to HF, e.g. young adults, pregnant or postpartum women, may be misdiagnosed.\n\n【3】### 6.5.2 Patient History\n\n【4】A detailed history is important to identify any cardiac and noncardiac disorders that may contribute to the development or progression of HF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Elements of the patient history should include chief complaint, history of present illness (HPI), past medical history, family history, social history and habits, review of systems, and a functional assessment . Risk assessment can be useful to estimate subsequent mortality risk, including utilization of biomarkers and a variety of risk models that guide treatment plans 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 21 , 22 \\]</u>. Available risk score models frequently used in the chronic HF population include the Seattle Heart Failure Model, Heart Failure Survival Score, and the CHARM and CORONA Risk Scores 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Functional assessment and ability to complete activities of daily living are helpful in assessing the overall degree of limitation. The 6-min walk can be easily evaluated in all settings and is a measure of exercise capacity that can be trended over time following the initial diagnosis of HF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 \\]</u> Functional assessement often correlates with NYHA heart failure classification and should be monitored over time to evaluate changes in severity of illness, including signs and symptoms of decompensation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\nTable 6.4 删除换行 Heart failure patient history 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>\n\n| HPI  | Chief complaint Signs/symptoms Hospitalizations Emergency department visits Medications & supplements Allergies/intolerances  | Chief complaint Signs/symptoms Hospitalizations Emergency department visits Medications & supplements Allergies/intolerances  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Past medical history  | Cardiac conditions Coronary artery disease Myocardial infarction Cardiac surgery/procedures Hypertension Infiltrative disease Amyloidosis Sarcoidosis Hereditary disease Cardiomyopathy Hemochromatosis Sickle cell trait Thalassemia Dysrhythmias Devices Pacemaker Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) Implanted cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)  | Noncardiac conditions Diabetes mellitus Hyper/hypothyroidism Peripheral vascular disease Connective tissue disorders Lupus erythematosus Scleroderma Infectious disease Hepatitis C Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Renal insufficiency/chronic kidney disease Mediastinal irradiation Pheochromocytoma Anemia Obesity  |\n| Family history  | Coronary artery disease Cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack Cardiomyopathy (3 generations for idiopathic/familial) Sudden cardiac death Hypertension Hyperlipidemia  | Coronary artery disease Cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack Cardiomyopathy (3 generations for idiopathic/familial) Sudden cardiac death Hypertension Hyperlipidemia  |\n| Social history/social determinates of health  | Social support system Family Marital status Care partner Childcare Financial resources/strain Insurance/access to care Education Work/profession  | Tobacco/alcohol Illicit drugs Religion/culture Transportation Food insecurity Health literacy Mental health Exposure to adversity Violence Trauma Personal safety Housing/utilities  |\n\n【6】### 6.5.3 Physical Exam\n\n【7】A primary goal in assessment of the patient with HF is to determine the extent and severity of disease. Physical examination focuses primarily on the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems. Volume status, vital signs, and weight should be evaluated at every patient encounter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Orthostatic hypotension can be common and may be related to vasodilation, low cardiac output, and/or volume depletion.\n\n【8】The HF-focused exam includes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 \\]</u>:\n\n【9】   General inspection—skin/nailbed color, mental status, respiratory effort.\n   Jugular venous pressure (JVP)—normal <8 cm when assessed at 45-degree angle.\n   Heart sounds/murmurs.\n   Lung sounds.\n   Hepatojugular reflux (HJR)/abdominojugular test—increase in JVP when manual pressure applied over the liver.\n   Peripheral edema/skin temperature.\n\n【10】A variety of abnormal assessment findings may be seen in the HF population. Findings may include tachycardia and tachypnea, elevated JVP, rales or crackles, decreased breath sounds, S3 heart sound, displaced point of maximal impulse (PMI), ascites, HJR, reduced strength of peripheral pulses, cyanosis, and cardiac cachexia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. Tachycardia is typically a compensatory response to low cardiac output. Cardiac enlargement is detected by palpation, with the PMI laterally displaced or presence of a precordial heave. A third heart sound, S3, is associated with congestion and may be one of the earliest signs of cardiac decompensation due to HF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 \\]</u>. Murmurs are indicative of valvular dysfunction. Mitral regurgitation can occur with increased LV mass and dilation of the valve annulus. Both elevation of JVP and positive HJR reflect venous congestion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 , 24 \\]</u>. Respiratory rate and pattern reflect the degree of pulmonary compromise. Crackles from transudative fluid in the alveolar spaces may be auscultated, but clear breath sounds do not exclude the presence of pulmonary edema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Peripheral edema is most common in the lower extremities, ankles, and feet. In severe, untreated fluid volume overload, anasarca may occur. Cool and mottled extremities are associated with low cardiac output. Cardiac cachexia and muscle wasting are not well understood but are a poor prognostic sign 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 \\]</u>. See also Chap. 4 for more details of the physical exam for presence and severity of HF.\n\n【11】### 6.5.4 Diagnostic Evaluation\n\n【12】If a diagnosis of HFrEF is suspected, initial evaluation includes measurement of natriuretic peptides, electrocardiography, and chest X-ray. Signs of congestion and cardiomegaly on chest X-ray are sensitive for HF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 \\]</u>. Transthoracic echocardiogram remains the gold standard for evaluation of ejection fraction (EF), left and right ventricular mass, chamber size, valvular dysfunction, and pericardial effusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Routine, repeat measurement of left ventricular (LV) function is not warranted in the absence of a change in clinical status 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. New patient HF evaluation should also incorporate laboratory analysis to establish baseline levels and evaluate for disorders that contribute to or exacerbate HF and includes electrolytes, hepatic and renal function, thyroid function, diabetes mellitus, and anemia. Genetic testing is warranted for familial or genetically transmitted disorders affecting the myocardium. Based on the 2017 HF guidelines, measurement of natriuretic peptides should be utilized to assist in the diagnosis or exclusion of HF, to aid in the determination of prognosis, and for risk stratification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 26 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】The etiology of HFrEF is often ischemia; newly diagnosed patients typically require an evaluation for CAD. Left heart cardiac catheterization (LHC) with coronary angiography is the benchmark diagnostic tool for identification of obstructive epicardial CAD. Noninvasive evaluation may be considered for patients who are deemed low risk for atherosclerosis. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI), positron emission tomography (PET), or technetium pyrophosphate scintigraphy (PYP) may be indicated, depending upon clinical presentation and suspicion of specific underlying illness, such as myocarditis or amyloidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 \\]</u>. Right heart catheterization (RHC) to evaluate hemodynamic status and cardiopulmonary exercise stress testing (CPXT) to evaluate functional capacity are utilized to assess degree of cardiac decompensation, response to GDMT, and when evaluating an individual’s candidacy for advanced therapies, such as ventricular assist devices (VAD) and cardiac transplantation. Endomyocardial biopsy is not routinely performed but can be helpful in diagnosing myocarditis, post-transplant rejection, or other infiltrative processes  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\nTable 6.5 删除换行 Diagnostic tools for evaluation of HFrEF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 25 – 27 \\]</u>\n\n| Laboratory studies  | Diagnostic imaging  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Natriuretic peptides  | 12 Lead EKG  |\n| Biomarkers (e.g. troponin, ST2)  | Chest X-ray  |\n| Complete blood count  | 2D echocardiogram  |\n| Basic metabolic profile  | Cardiac catheterization  |\n| Hepatic function panel  | Stress testing  |\n| Iron studies  | MRI  |\n| Urinalysis  | PET  |\n| Thyroid function tests  | PYP scan  |\n| Hemoglobin A1c  | CPXT  |\n| Lipid panel  | Endomyocardial biopsy  |\n| Genetic testing  |  |\n\n【15】### 6.5.5 Clinical Presentation\n\n【16】Patients with HF may present initially with a wide variety of symptoms that are vague and nonspecific, confounding the diagnosis. Dyspnea, at rest or with exertion, and fatigue are often the predominate symptoms prompting an individual to seek treatment. Additional cardinal symptoms include fluid retention, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. Patients may complain of abdominal pain and early satiety due to splanchnic and liver congestion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 28 \\]</u>. Bendopnea, shortness of breath when bending forward, is associated with advanced NYHA classification and greater mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 29 \\]</u>. Signs and symptoms may be defined based upon the primary targets of congestion. Left-sided symptoms are primarily reflected in the lungs and pulmonary system whereas right-sided symptoms appear in the peripheral vasculature .\nTable 6.6 删除换行 Signs and symptoms of left and right ventricular failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 28 , 30 \\]</u>\n\n| LV failure  | RV failure  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Shortness of breath  | Jugular venous distention  |\n| Tachypnea  | Edema  |\n| Orthopnea  | Abdominal distension  |\n| Benopnea  | Hepatomegaly  |\n| Cough  | Ascites  |\n| Crackles/rales  | Anorexia/early satiety  |\n| Pleural effusion  | Nausea  |\n|  | Right upper quadrant pain  |\n|  | Anasarca  |\n\n【18】### 6.5.6 Guideline-Directed Medical Therapy\n\n【19】Utilization of GDMT is centered upon specific treatment recommendations as categorized by the ACC/AHA heart failure staging system and NYHA classification  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. GDMT for HFrEF focuses on patients with Stage C and D HF. NYHA class will vary based upon changes in clinical condition and symptoms. Overall management goals include symptom control, prevention of disease progression, and reduction of HF hospitalization rates and mortality.\n\n【20】The landscape of evidence-based medications for HFrEF continues to evolve but the cornerstone remains neurohormonal blockade to counteract the deleterious effects of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, ARBs, ARNI, and aldosterone antagonists/mineralocorticoid receptor agonists (AA/MRA) all have morality benefit in patients with HF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 26 \\]</u>. Based on the totality of data surrounding ARNI, sacubitril/valsartan (the first and only commercially available ARNI in the USA) is the preferred RAAS antagonist in HFrEF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 31 \\]</u>. Although ACEI and ARB medications are used interchangeably and are considered to have a “class effect,” only three beta blockers are approved for use in HF—bisoprolol, carvedilol, and metoprolol succinate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Diuretics are commonly prescribed to manage congestion and volume overload and are solely for symptom control. Hydralazine in combination with nitrates is an alternative for those patients who have contraindications or intolerance to ACEI/ARB/ARNI and in special populations, such as African Americans. Digoxin may be prescribed to improve symptoms and reduce HF hospitalization rates. Ivabradine acts at the level of the sinoatrial node to lower heart rate without compromising blood pressure and was demonstrated to improve HF hospitalization rates in the Systolic Heart Failure Treatment with the I <sub>f </sub> Inhibitor Trial (SHIFT) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 32 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】Additional therapies continue to gain Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval as new pathological targets have been identified to improve symptoms and/or outcomes for patients with HFrEF, such as the guanylyl cyclase (sCG) stimulators and the sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 31 \\]</u>. Vericiguat, a sCG stimulator, received FDA approval in January 2021 and is the first treatment for chronic heart failure approved specifically for patients following a hospitalization for HF or in need of outpatient intravenous (IV) diuretics. Based on the results of the pivotal, phase III Vericiguat Global Study in Subjects with Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (VICTORIA) trial, vericiguat is indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and HF hospitalization among patients with symptomatic chronic HF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 33 \\]</u>. Vericiguat is adjunctive therapy to baseline GDMT and works through the nitric oxide pathway to increase smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 34 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】Although the complete mechanism of action remains unclear, SGLT2 inhibition has repeatedly shown benefit among the HFrEF population in patients with and without diabetes mellitus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 31 \\]</u>. SGLT2 inhibition promotes diuresis and natriuresis (sodium loss), leading to reduction in preload, blood pressure, arterial stiffness, and afterload, thereby improving subendocardial blood flow. SGLT2 inhibition is also associated with a shift to ketone-based myocardial metabolism and preservation of renal function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 35 \\]</u>. Two SGLT2 agents, empagliflozin and dapagliflozin, have an approved indication for HF. SGLT2 inhibition received a Class IA recommendation with publication of the 2022 HF guideline to reduce HF hospitalization and reduce cardiovascular mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.

Approximately 1% of neonates have some form of respiratory distress that is not associated with infection such as transient tachy-pnea of the newborn. TTN results from a delay in clearance of fetal liquid from the lungs. Infants with TTN usually present with tachypnea within the first few hours of life. It has been associated with precipitous deliveries and births by cesarean section. The use of medications in TTN is minimal， although empiric antibiotics are often used for 48 hours after birth until sepsis has been ruled out. Medical care of TTN is supportive. As the retained lung fluid is absorbed by the infant's lymphatic system， the pulmonary status of the infant typically improves. TTN resolves over a 24-hour to 72-hour period.\n\n【47】What is your plan of treatment， referral， and follow-up care?\n\n【48】Begin oxygen therapy in the office.\n\n【49】Refer the patient and family to the local emergency department for support of the respiratory system， a workup for possible sepsis (complete blood count， blood cultures， lumbar puncture for culture of cerebrospinal fluid， and urine culture)， and consultation with a neonatologist.

B： Admit her to the hospital for a psychosocial assessment within 24 hours Q2. C： Overdose was planned and she had left messages for friends and family\n\n【20】The topic area of child and adolescent mental health forms an important part of the syllabus for the Applied Knowledge paper . Self-harm is defined as any form of behaviour that leads to self-injury， including cutting， burning， overdosing on medicines， preventing wound healing or hanging. Often the behaviour is a way of reducing emotional pain and distracting the young person from suicidal thoughts. It is important to consider the language used when discussing self-harm with adolescents； the young person should not feel judged regarding their behaviour and their emotional distress needs to be recognised and taken seriously. Self-harm is a serious public health problem and the rates of self-harm are a proxy indicator of the extent of mental health illness in young people within society通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>. Approximately 25，000 adolescents present to hospitals in the UK each year following non-fatal self-harm， although it is estimated that only 1 in 10 children who do self-harm are seen by hospital services 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>.\n\n【21】The first question is nuanced， and typifies some of the difficulties with the Applied Knowledge paper， and， indeed， some of those encountered as a more senior paediatrician. The knowledge that this young woman has undetectable paracetamol levels makes this question more testing. In deciding the best course of action it is helpful to consider which options would be unsafe. It would not be appropriate or safe to admit this patient to a side room until a full risk assessment of suicidal intention has been completed， as the patient needs to be easily observed at all times. A safeguarding assessment should take place at the time of admission， as this adds to the initial risk assessment； safeguarding issues may also be an underlying reason for self-harm behaviours. An outpatient referral is generally not advisable， as a full risk assessment by CAMHS should be undertaken promptly to assess the risk of further self-harm and the risk of suicidal intent. Advice given now about the risks of injury or harm as a result of inappropriate paracetamol ingestion may make the situation worse.\n\n【22】The second question requires an understanding of the evidence base concerning self-harm in young adults. Premeditated， rather than impulsive， self-harm is suggested by planning and consideration for events after death， and is an indicator for increased risk of true suicidal intent. There is no evidence to support a link between the number of tablets taken and the degree of suicidal intent. Similarly， evidence of other self-harm behaviour， such as cutting (also see below) does not help stratify suicidal intent. While parental separation may be a reason for emotional distress and self-harm behaviours， it does not have a direct link to suicidal intent. There is an association between mental health difficulties and premature death linked to risk behaviours such as smoking and alcohol， but it does not clearly inform suicide risk.\n\n【23】Adolescents may present to the emergency department with a range of self-harm thoughts or behaviours. These would range from discussing such thoughts through to completed suicide. Patients may appear aggressive or passive， agitated or withdrawn， and may express fear， anxiety or remorse. Most young people who self-harm do not have suicidal intent， but it is difficult to ascertain this at presentation when levels of distress are high. Cutting is the most common form of self-harm and is often impulsive. It usually indicates a maladaptation of the coping mechanism aimed at reducing emotional distress or anxiety. Girls are more likely to attempt self-harm than boys， but boys are at higher risk of completed suicide.\n\n【24】eri assessing a person who presents with self-harm， it is important to consider the level of planning and intent， and the frequency of thoughts and actions that relate to self-harm or suicide. Other symptoms or signs that might suggest the presence of an underlying mental health illness are relevant， and would include a history of substance abuse and self-harm or suicidal behaviour in family members or the peer group.\n\n【25】i is helpful to consider the 4 Ps when assessing the patient： predisposing factors， precipitating factors， perpetuating or maintaining factors， and protective factors or resilience.\n\n【26】Psychosocial assessments such as the HEADSSS framework can be used to encourage adolescents to discuss difficulties. This structured assessment starts by asking simple questions about the young person's home life， education and activities before moving on to more sensitive topics such as drugs and alcohol， sex and relationships， self-harm behaviours and safety 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u>. In any such discussion with the young person， it is usually more helpful to focus on how the young person is feeling and what led to the self-harm behaviour rather than what the behaviour is itself.\n\n【27】Examples of safeguarding issues that might be revealed during a psychosocial assessment for self-narm include a young person who is worried she is pregnant， who may be the subject of child sexual exploitation， or who may have been raped. A much older ‘partner' should always lead to more detailed enquiries. The possibility of a safeguarding risk should be seriously considered if a young person presents to the emergency department without a responsible adult， or if a parent or carer has not shown concern for the whereabouts of the young person.\n\n【28】There are recognised risk factors for suicidal behaviours， and these include depression and coexisting mental health issues such as anxiety. Previous suicide attempts， the use of drugs or alcohol when upset， and detailed planning on how to avoid discovery after the suicide attempt are all indicators of the risk of completed suicide or repetition of self-harm. A history of a relative or friend having committed suicide recently should be taken seriously. There has been relatively little research into factors that are protective against suicidal ideation and intent， but enhancing social skills， problem-solving abilities and the capacity of family and carers to offer emotional support are thought to be beneficial.\n\n【29】The care and management of young people who present with self-harm involves addressing any immediate medical needs， such as the treatment of the drug overdose to minimise any adverse effect. The medical management of a paracetamol overdose is a common topic in both the Foundation of Practice and Theory and Science examinations. The care and safety of the young person is paramount and it is usual practice to admit them for a more detailed psychosocial assessment by adolescent mental health professionals. This must take place promptly while the young person is in hospital. The young person should be cared for on an open ward in view of the nursing staff so that safety can be monitored. Ongoing management is targeted towards addressing the underlying difficulties of the young person. It is important to ensure that they are given alternative mechanisms for coping with the pressures that make them consider self-harm.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

A solid nodule with ill-defined borders on imaging  删除换行1 is likely to be a malignant tumour, while that with a sharp circumscription is more likely to  删除换行1 be benign; however, there are many exceptions to this rule. Cysts may also arise in the testis  删除换行1 but more commonly in its vestigial remnants (appendix of testis and appendix of epididymis) 删除换行1 and are benign, although they may enlarge and undergo torsion. Loculated hydrocele may  删除换行1 develop secondary to trauma or inflammatory conditions. Fluid collections around the testis may be fluctuant and transilluminant on physical examination, and an ultrasound will  删除换行1 confirm the fluid contents. Inflammatory conditions such as epididymo-orchitis (mumps,  删除换行1 tuberculosis) are accompanied by systemic symptoms such as fever and a painful testicular  删除换行1 mass. Syphilitic gumma may be painless, representing burnt-out disease (tertiary syphilis).\nSerum tumour markers play an important role in the diagnosis, staging, risk stratification,  删除换行1 and post-treatment monitoring of testicular cancer. On the other hand, serum markers are  删除换行1 normal in testicular cysts and benign tumours such as Leydig cell adenoma.\nSerum LDH is elevated in seminoma, but it is a relatively non-specific marker, as LDH is  删除换行1 secreted by a number of other organs such as the liver. Serum AFP is elevated in yolk sac  删除换行1 tumours, while hCG is produced in large quantities in a choriocarcinoma. Monitoring serum  删除换行1 tumour marker levels after removal of the tumour is useful, as this would be accompanied  删除换行1 by a steep decline in its serum levels, which may progressively rise again if there is tumour  删除换行1 recurrence. Testicular tumours frequently occur in mixed forms so that one or more of these  删除换行1 serum markers may be elevated.\nPathological examination of the testis following orchidectomy plays a key role in predicting  删除换行1 clinical outcome. Malignant tumours (95%) are much more common than benign tumours.\nBroadly speaking, these are germ cell tumours and are subdivided into seminoma and nonseminomatous histological types. Seminoma is the most common subtype (80%), while  删除换行1 embryonal carcinoma, yolk sac tumour, and choriocarcinoma are collectively referred to as  删除换行1 non-seminomatous germ cell tumours (NSGCTs). Teratomas are another interesting subtype  删除换行1 of testicular cancer characterised by the presence of somatic (epithelial and connective tissue) 删除换行1 elements. NSGCTs may transform into the less aggressive teratoma following good response  删除换行1 to chemotherapy.\nOther adverse pathological features that influence clinical outcome include lymphovascular  删除换行1 invasion, invasion of the rete testis, spermatic cord, peritoneal covering (tunica vaginalis),  删除换行1 and scrotal skin. Ultrasound and CT scan are important in identifying metastases to lymph  删除换行1 nodes and other organs such as lungs, liver, and bones.\nTreatment of seminoma in the absence of these adverse features is orchidectomy and is curative in 80–85% cases. Adjuvant chemotherapy is required if adverse features are present or  删除换行1 for NSGCT with markedly elevated serum tumour markers.\nIt is also important to remember that germ cell tumours may arise in an extratesticular location anywhere along the midline from the base of the skull to the sacrococcygeal tip.

It is associated with elevated serum bilirubin and  删除换行1 a significant risk of fetal prematurity.\n\n【24】PG is a pregnancy-associated subepidermal immunobullous disease, analogous to bullous pemphigoid.

This is Kaposi sarcoma， an angiogenic neoplasm prevalent in HIV-positive patients. Kaposi sarcoma is caused by human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8)， a member of the Herpesviridae family. Members of this family are DNA viruses with a double-stranded， linear genome in an enveloped， icosahedral capsid. What important alternative diagnosis must be ruled out? An important alternative diagnosis for such skin lesions in HIV patients is bacillary angiomatosis (BA)， which typically presents with systemic symptoms such as fever， chills， and malaise. However， because BA is caused by Bartonella henselae it is nonneoplastic and can readily be treated with antibiotics. How does the microorganism cause the characteristic discolored skin lesions? HHV-8 has a tropism for endothelium cells and is thought to induce vascular endothelial growth factor， which causes irregular vascular channels to develop in the skin. RBCs extravasate into these spaces， causing the characteristic purple-red skin lesions as seen in Figure 3-21. What other diseases are associated with this microorganism?\n\n【3】Kaposi sarcoma is not limited to the skin； the gastrointestinal tract， oral mucosa， lungs， lymph nodes， and other visceral organs may be infected. HHV-8 also infects B lymphocytes and has been linked to body-cavity B-cell lymphoma (a non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtype) and to Castleman disease (a lymphoproliferative disorder that may progress to lymphoma).\n\n【4】What other patient population is at increased risk for developing this infection?\n\n【5】Transplantation patients， who， like patients with HlV， are chronically immunosuppressed， have a higher incidence of infection than the general public.\n\n【6】What are the appropriate treatments for this condition?\n\n【7】Daunorubicin or doxorubicin is the treatment of choice.

What set of characteristics is expected in this patient?\n删除个例：<u>> Reproduced, with permission, from USMLERx.com.</u>\n> (A) A\n\n【1】> (B) B\n\n【2】> (C) C\n\n【3】> (D) D\n\n【4】> (E) E\n\n【5】 Answer: The correct answer is B. The patient most likely has pancreatic adenocarcinoma that is located at the head of the pancreas, leading to obstruction of the common bile duct. Weight loss, painless jaundice, and a palpable gallbladder (Courvoisier sign) can occur in pancreatic cancer. The obstruction from the growing tumor results in conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, increased urine bilirubin levels, and decreased urine urobilinogen levels. The majority of bilirubin results from the breakdown of heme groups in senescent RBCs. After cellular release, bilirubin binds to albumin, which delivers the molecule to the liver. Hepatocellular uptake and glucuronidation in the endoplasmic reticulum generate conjugated bilirubin, which is water soluble and excreted in the bile. Gut bacteria deconjugate the bilirubin and degrade it to urobilinogens. The urobilinogens are excreted in the feces, with some reabsorption and excretion into urine. Based on this metabolic schema, the laboratory values in obstructive liver disease become evident. Failed excretion of conjugated bilirubin leads to a direct bilirubinemia. Failure of urobilinogen production by gut flora leads to low levels of urine urobilinogen. The urine bilirubin level is elevated secondary to the increased plasma concentration of direct bilirubin, which undergoes renal excretion.\n\n【6】Answer A is incorrect. Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, increased urine bilirubin levels, and normal urine urobilinogen levels can be seen in patients with hepatocellular jaundice. The urine urobilinogen level is normal because, unlike in obstructive jaundice, gut bacteria have the opportunity to synthesize urobilinogen. The clinical presentation and physical findings presented here supports a diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, not hepatocellular jaundice.  \nAnswer C is incorrect. Unconjugated hyper-bilirubinemia, increased urine bilirubin levels, and decreased urine urobilinogen levels can occur with hepatocellular disease if there is also concurrent conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. However, a pure obstructive condition is not characterized by unconjugated hyperbili-rubinemia.  \nAnswer D is incorrect. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, decreased urine bilirubin levels, and increased urine urobilinogen levels is a classic pattern seen in hemolytic jaundice. In this case the bilirubin level rises due to increased heme turnover and may overwhelm the liver’s ability to conjugate it. These features would not be seen in obstructive liver disease. Patients with certain diseases that increase RBC turnover, such as sickle cell disease, spherocytosis, and glucose-6-phoshate dehydrogenase deficiency, may have hemolytic jaundice. The clinical presentation and physical findings here point to a diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, not hemolytic jaundice.  \nAnswer E is incorrect. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, decreased urine bilirubin, and decreased urine urobilinogen are very unlikely to occur simultaneously in any given condition.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Renal failure can be treated both acutely and chronically with dialysis. The other answer choices are associated with higher medical futility， meaning that an intervention such as CPR may offer no chance of significant benefit to the patient. Interventions can be considered futile if the probability of success(discharged alive from the hospital) is <1% and/or the quality of life is below the minimum acceptable to the patient. In the scenario from this question， the patient's probability of survival after CPR is below average， based on his quad-riplegia and mild pneumonia. In fact， in cases of severe pneumonia and respira-tory failure survival is <1%. His quality of life is not without value. Since he is fully awake and alert， Mr H could be asked about his view of the quality of his life. A discussion about likelyscenarios should he have a cardiac arrest and need CPR is important. Thereafter， Mr H can tell you if he prefers to have CPR or nothing done in the event of an arrest. No judgment about the possible utility or futility of CPR based on Mr H's current condition can be reached without a discussion. The decision about resuscitation should occur only after consulting with the patient and family members about his situation and reaching a joint decision.\n\n【11】7.2 D. This patient is elderly and has a diagnosis of metastatic cancer. Out of hospi-tal survival would not be expected should this patient require CPR. Thus CPR for Ms W could be described as a “futile\" effort. The patient does not meet other criteria for futility. It is important that she is of sound mind. A DNR order should not be written even if a CPR would be judged as useless unless there is patient or family concurrence. Patients must be given time to understand the seriousness of their diagnosis. Periodic readdressing the question of CPR with them and their family should be continuing. This is best done in the context of other medical decisions that occur during the patient's care.

FD initially presents as a distinct follicular pustule or papule that may be tender, painful, or pruritic. This area begins to slowly expand creating irregularly shaped patches of scarring alopecia as the follicular orifice is lost. Active disease continues peripherally in an expanding pattern. FD has a waxing and waning course with periods of more intense disease presentation followed by periods of reduced activity.

Another notable characteristic of FD is tufting of hair characterized by multiple hairs 通用删除7(英):<u>(5–20)</u> emerging from the same dilated follicle. The first step in the diagnosis of FD involves gathering a general medical history and a bacterial infection history as Staphylococcus aureus is commonly cultured from the active lesions. Following this, a thorough examination of the scalp should be performed to look for follicular ostia, perifollicular erythema, or follicular hyperkeratosis. Treatment for FD has traditionally focused on controlling inflammation and the microbiota through the use of steroids and antibiotics. Destruction of hair follicles results in permanent hair loss; therefore, therapy is targeted at active lesions to prevent future permanent hair loss. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with red light as well as immunotherapies are potential treatments usually in those patients who are refractory to steroids and antibiotics. Both of these treatment options lack robust evidence and are associated with mixed outcomes. As FD can be a painful, distressing, disease that is scarring in nature, patient counseling is essential for comprehensive patient care.\n\n【13】Keywords\n\n【14】Folliculitis decalvans Cicatricial alopecia Hair tufting Staphylococcus aureus Photodynamic therapy\n\n【15】A 60-year-old male presented with tender, firm lesions on the central scalp of 6 months duration.

Primary cicatricial alopecia is characterized by inflammatory destruction of the hair follicle, resulting in permanent hair loss, in contrast to secondary cicatricial alopecia, where non-follicular disease results in the follicle destruction (e.g. pemphigus vulgaris, burns) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. FD is considered a rare cause of alopecia, and in a large multicenter retrospective study was found to account for 3% of 3133 diagnoses of alopecia and 11% of 840 diagnoses of cicatricial alopecia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. FD presents in both men and women but shows male predominance. FD usually occurs in young to middle-aged adults and more frequently in African-American patients than in Caucasian patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】Clinically, FD initially presents as a distinct follicular pustule or papule that may be tender, painful, or pruritic 删除33：<u></u>. Expansion ensues as adjacent papulopustules appear on the periphery of the erythematous lesion. Slowly, irregularly shaped patches of scarring alopecia occur, and the follicular orifice is lost. Active disease continues peripherally in an expanding pattern. Yellow-gray scales may be present, especially around the follicles, as well as follicular hyperkeratosis, erosions, and hemorrhagic crusts. FD has a waxing and waning course with periods of more intense disease presentation followed by periods of reduced activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. FD may affect any area of the scalp but preferentially affects the vertex and occiput and often presents with multifocal lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. It almost exclusively involves the scalp, though there have been rare cases affecting the beard, face, and nape of the neck 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Another notable characteristic of FD is the tufting of hair characterized by multiple hairs 通用删除7(英):<u>(5–20)</u> emerging from the same dilated follicle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Despite its classification as a neutrophilic alopecia, FD may possibly be a continuum of disease with eventual lichenoid features depending on levels of bacterial biomarkers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】A photograph of a person's head with bald spots on the vertex.

Image courtesy of Dr. Melissa Piliang and Janine Sot, MBA medical photographer</u>\n\n【30】Histologically, FD commonly presents with an intrafollicular and perifollicular neutrophilic infiltrate. As the disease progresses, this infiltrate spreads into the surrounding adventitial dermis. Foreign body giant cells may be present and are localized to ectopic portions of the hair shaft 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In late stages of the disease, chronic inflammation results in the presence of more plasma cells and fewer neutrophils. These advanced lesions may also present with dermal fibrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. On dermoscopy, FD presents as fused follicular infundibula and thickened interfollicular keloid-like areas with tufted hairs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】While there are multiple theories on the etiology of FD, the pathophysiology is unknown. Many of the theories involve Staphylococcus aureus as it is commonly cultured from FD pustules. This finding has driven the use of antibiotics as the principal treatment for FD. However, it is important to note that while S. aureus is commonly cultured from active lesions, FD is not simply a bacterial infection. One study proposed that the epidermal barrier may be defective in FD. This study compared the superficial and subepidermal microbiota and found S. aureus colonized in 16 out of 20 patients in non-lesional, subepidermal skin in patients with lesions. As S. aureus was present in non-lesioned subepidermal skin, the implication is that FD could be due to a rupture of the epidermal barrier resulting in the invasion of opportunistic bacteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Other theories range from a congenital abnormality of follicular orifices to a deficiency in the host immune response to S. aureus autoimmune process 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The postulation that the host cell-mediated immunity is defective may explain the effectiveness of biological medications such as adalimumab in some refractory cases of FD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. More research is required before the etiology of FD can be determined conclusively.\n\n【32】The first step in the diagnosis of FD involves gathering a general medical history and a bacterial infection history. Following this, a thorough examination of the scalp should be performed to look for follicular ostia, perifollicular erythema, or follicular hyperkeratosis. Measurements, bacterial cultures, and biopsies of the active lesions should be taken to determine the diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【33】Treatment\n---------\n\n【34】Due to the erythematous pustules with abnormal bacterial findings, treatment for FD traditionally has focused on controlling inflammation and the microbiota through the use of steroids and antibiotics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Treatment of FD is most effective for patients with active disease. Destruction of hair follicles results in permanent hair loss; therefore, therapy is targeted at active lesions to prevent future permanent hair loss. As FD can be a painful, distressing, disease that is scarring in nature, patient counseling is essential. Additionally, camouflaging techniques (e.g. wigs, caps, hairpieces, etc.) are possible solutions, but they can be a reservoir for S. aureus ; therefore, cleansing with antiseptics and frequent switching between headpieces is important.\n\n【35】Current evidence of therapies is primarily based on observational studies or small sample sizes that lack external validity. One comparative case-control study was performed that focused on the impact of S. aureus on FD before and after an anti-staphylococcal treatment of rifampicin and clindamycin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. S. aureus was found initially in 0/20 of the control patients and 16/20 of the patients with FD. After treatment, 70% of patients had a decrease in pustule and crust formation and approximately 60% of patients had a decrease in the peripilar erythema. The S. aureus colonies almost completely disappeared, only remaining positive in two patients. Despite efficacious treatment, peripilar erythema persisted in about 80% of patients to a moderate degree 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【36】For mild to moderate FD, topical antibiotics and topical and intralesional steroids are first-line therapies and can be used especially for those desiring to avoid the systemic side effects of antibiotics and steroids. The potency of the topical steroids is such that they can be applied locally 2 or 3 times per week in conjunction with topical antibiotics to treat FD of slight or moderate severity. Treatment with intralesional steroids is among the most effective methods for treating FD, and they can be used once every 3 months for slight inflammation in mild to moderate FD. Oral antibiotics, such as tetracyclines or azithromycin, may also be administered for mild to moderate FD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【37】As FD becomes more severe, the above treatments may still be considered. However, for refractory cases, a combination of rifampicin with clindamycin is more effective with a longer duration of response. Clindamycin 300 mg twice daily with rifampin 300 mg twice daily are dosed for 12 weeks. Systemic corticosteroids may also be effective to control FD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 12 \\]</u>. Isotretinoin is beneficial for FD that is not well controlled with previous treatments, and other cases demonstrate that it can result in complete remission of FD and may warrant further consideration as a primary treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 13 \\]</u>.\n\n【38】Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with red light is another potential treatment, though it lacks robust evidence and is associated with mixed outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. To date, the largest study of PDT in FD selected 13 patients with previously poor outcomes using various topical and oral agents and placed them on a course of PDT with no other therapy. All showed improvement during treatment, and at 12-month follow-up, nine patients maintained well-controlled symptoms while four relapsed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Insufficient evidence supports using PDT as first-line therapy, but it may be beneficial to use in refractory cases of FD.\n\n【39】Lastly, there have been reports of various immunotherapies namely secukinumab, adalimumab, hydroxychloroquine, and infliximab successfully treating FD, and one case utilizing apremilast 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 16 , 17 \\]</u>. All of these patients were refractory to traditional treatments and responded favorably to their respective immunotherapy. This may indicate an underlying defect of the immune system in individuals with FD, especially in refractory cases. Additionally, the efficacy of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was demonstrated in the treatment of two cases of refractory FD. Further research is needed to understand the successful symptomatic control achieved with PRP, but its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects are promising for FD treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>.\n\n【40】Key Points\n----------\n\n【41】   Folliculitis decalvans (FD) is a rare cause of alopecia identified by active erythematous disease on the periphery of lesions.\n   Despite bacteria in active pustules, a simple bacterial infection is not the sole cause of FD manifestation.\n   Initial treatment is topical/oral antibiotics, like tetracyclines, and rifampicin/clindamycin and corticosteroids.\n   Future therapies, especially in refractory cases, may involve PDT and various immunotherapies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

She could initially walk for 2–3 miles without any symptoms, but she had to gradually decrease this distance due to dyspnea and fatigue. Her symptoms were initially attributed to her aging and she did not seek further attention, however they continued to worsen. She eventually started feeling lightheaded and having chest pressure with exertion, at which point she went to the emergency department. A computed tomogram (CT) pulmonary angiography was performed showing large central pulmonary artery filling defects 删除33：<u></u>. Based on this she was diagnosed with an acute pulmonary embolus for which she was treated with catheter directed thrombolysis using tPA. Based on hospital reports, pulmonary artery pressures and angiographic imaging did not improve significantly after this procedure. Although lower extremity ultrasound did not exhibit any evidence of deep vein thrombosis, due to the size of the filling defects within the pulmonary vasculature on CT it was decided to proceed with an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement. During placement, venography revealed a duplicated IVC, therefore dual IVC filters were deployed. She was started on a heparin drip after conclusion of the above procedures, switched to rivaroxaban, and eventually discharged home.\n\n【19】删除3：<u>Figure 9.1\n\n【20】Selected images from computed tomography pulmonary angiography </u>\n\n【21】Past medical history included osteopenia, systemic hypertension, anxiety, gastro-esophageal reflux disease, and cataracts for which she had right eye surgery a few years prior. Her only other surgery was a total abdominal hysterectomy and oophorectomy more than 15 years before her current presentation. She had no known allergies, and no history of prior deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary emboli. She also denied any prior estrogen use.\n\n【22】Social history disclosed no alcohol, tobacco, diet pill or illicit drug use. She worked as a flight attendant prior to retiring and was widowed. Her family history did not include any clotting disorder or any relatives with prior blood clots. She noted a rash with penicillin and some pruritus with enoxaparin and with clindamycin.\n\n【23】A few weeks after her discharge, she followed up as an outpatient with a pulmonologist due to continued shortness of breath and decreased exercise tolerance. Not only had she not returned to her baseline, but she occasionally experienced exertional chest tightness and palpitations that were alleviated with rest. On one occasion, after pushing herself to walk approximately 200 ft at a brisk pace, she felt dizzy and pre-syncopal. Her pulmonologist ordered an echocardiogram that showed a normal left ventricular size and systolic function, with mild diastolic dysfunction. Abnormal ventricular septal motion and position were noted, suggesting the presence or right ventricular pressure overload. The right ventricle was moderately enlarged and hypertrophied with reduced systolic function and the right ventricular systolic pressure was reported at 67 mmHg with a TAPSE measured at 1.32 cm. The left atrium was normal, the right atrium was moderately dilated and a trivial pericardial effusion was noted in addition to some moderate tricuspid regurgitation. The main pulmonary artery was enlarged and a large mass was seen within it.\n\n【24】Based on these findings and in the context of her more chronic and progressive symptoms with poor response to anticoagulation, chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension was suspected and she was referred to a CTEPH center for pulmonary thromboendarterectomy (PTE) surgery evaluation.\n\n【25】During her evaluation for PTE surgery her vital signs were notable for elevated systemic blood pressure at 150/73, a temperature of 97 °F, a respiratory rate of 16, and a SpO2 of 98% on room air. Her height was 5′ 4″ and her weight was 60.5 kg. On exam, she had mild JVD and an accentuated P2 heart sound. Although her lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally, a loud flow murmur was heard over her right lung zones during breath hold. Her only other finding were some lower extremity varicose veins.\n\n【26】At that time a chest x-ray showed two IVC filters in place, some blunting of the left costophrenic angle, enlarged pulmonary arteries, and a prominent right ventricle 删除33：<u></u>.\n\n【27】删除3：<u>Figure 9.2</u>\n\n【28】Chest radiograph\n\n【29】Moreover a ventilation perfusion lung scintigraphy scan showed lack of perfusion to the entire left lung and a wedge defect of the superior segment of the right middle lobe 删除33：<u>通用删除1(英):<u>(selected views in Fig. 9.3 )</u></u>.\n\n【30】删除3：<u>Figure 9.3\n\n【31】Ventilation perfusion scintigraphy (RAO: right anterior oblique, Lat: lateral)</u>\n\n【32】After the above preliminary testing she underwent a left heart catheterization to rule out any coronary artery disease prior to possible PTE surgery that was unremarkable. Based on her imaging findings and her clinical history it was suspected that CTEPH was a less likely diagnosis. Therefore, right heart catheterization and digital subtraction pulmonary angiography were deferred and felt to be of excessive risk given the degree of proximal vessel occlusion by CT. As part of her evaluation, she did however undergo a positron emission tomography scan with fusion computed tomography images 删除33：<u></u>.\n\n【33】删除3：<u>Figure 9.4\n\n【34】Fusion PET CT images of the chest </u>\n\n【35】Following these studies she was admitted to the hospital, and placed on continuous intravenous heparin drip in anticipation of endarterectomy surgery. This was performed a few days later including pulmonary valve repair and PFO closure. The surgery was complicated by left lower lobe airway bleeding requiring a bronchial blocker that resolved within a few days 删除33：<u>通用删除1(英):<u>(specimen shown in Fig. 9.5 )</u></u>.\n\n【36】删除3：<u>Figure 9.5\n\n【37】Surgical specimen removed at time of endarterectomy</u>\n\n【38】Although her post-operative course was complicated by airway bleeding, an episode of aspiration and retained secretions, a small posterior cerebral artery stroke, and persisting dysphagia requiring a gastric tube placement, she was eventually discharged home approximately 4 weeks after her operation. Her final pathology noted high grade intimal sarcoma with PD-L1 positive staining. She is now being followed by radiation oncology and medical oncology and undergoing treatment for residual/metastatic pulmonary artery sarcoma.\n\n【39】Radiographic Interpretation\n---------------------------\n\n【40】From the outset, CT images in this case were very suggestive of a vascular tumor. The selected images from CT pulmonary angiography 删除33：<u></u> demonstrated an expansile mass within the main and left pulmonary artery (block arrow). The lesion extends to the level of the pulmonary valve and is of uniformly low attenuation with no calcification. Careful review reveals breach of the pulmonary artery wall (thin arrow) with extension of soft tissue in to the mediastinum. The loss of the integrity of the vascular wall is highly suspicious for an aggressive lesion such as a sarcoma. Chronic thromboembolic disease can involve the main pulmonary arteries, but the CT features were not typical of thrombus.\n\n【41】The chest radiograph 删除33：<u></u> demonstrated enlargement of the main pulmonary artery with reduced vascular markings in the left lung with few tiny foci of parenchymal scarring.\n\n【42】On VQ scintigraphy 删除33：<u></u> there was complete absence of perfusion to the left lung. Surprisingly, there was also a segmental wedge shaped mismatched perfusion defect in the right lung; this could be due to tumor “thrombus” or vascular metastases.\n\n【43】The positron emission tomography (PET) CT 删除33：<u></u> confirmed high FDG uptake in the soft tissue within the pulmonary arteries in keeping with a metabolically active intra-vascular malignancy.\n\n【44】Clinical Comments\n-----------------\n\n【45】This case is a dramatic illustration that proximal pulmonary intra-arterial filling defects are not universally thromboembolic in nature. In fact, there are a number of historical and radiographic hints, particularly on CT, that push the differential away from this being a large proximal vessel thromboembolus. That this patient experienced a decline in exercise capabilities over the months prior to presentation suggests a more chronic and progressive process. An acute saddle embolus of this size would not typically present in this manner. Additionally, a thromboembolus would not be expected to simply “halt” in the proximal main pulmonary artery, with contrast seen to completely opacify a normal sized vessel beyond the globular shaped lesion 删除33：<u></u>. Other features that might suggest a pulmonary vascular tumor include “eclipsing” or “breach” of the pulmonary arterial wall from the mass like lesion 删除10：<u></u>, extension of the mass involving the right ventricular outflow tract and pulmonic valve, size progression of the mass despite anticoagulation, and the presence of nodular lesions “within the parenchyma” following the course of the pulmonary arteries. Moreover, the presence of radiographic and/or echocardiographic signs of pulmonary hypertension with such a large burden of occlusive vascular disease would not be anticipated with an acute massive pulmonary embolus, where cardiogenic shock might be expected at the time of presentation.\n\n【46】An appreciation of some of the clinical and radiographic aspects of pulmonary vascular tumors can reduce the time interval to appropriate therapeutic intervention, including surgical endarterectomy and adjuvant modalities appropriate to the patient’s tumor type and clinical condition. A clinical suspicion of this unusual tumor might also prevent ineffectual and potentially life threatening attempts at reperfusion therapy.\n\n【47】Points of Emphasis\n------------------\n\n【48】The differential for major pulmonary arterial mass lesions includes vascular neoplasm. The clinical history and distinctive radiographic findings, particularly with CT and metabolic imaging, can be helpful in making this important distinction from acute or chronic thromboembolic disease.\n\n【49】Diagnosis\n---------\n\n【50】1.  1.\n    Pulmonary artery sarcoma.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

He has drunk significant amounts of alcohol for an imprecise period of his life. Currently， he also has a low-grade fever and mild abdominal tenderness； both signs suggest a possible infection. Bacterial infection of the ascitic fluid must be considered and evaluated because untreated cases have a high mortality. Although most patients with ascites and jaundice have cirrhosis， other etiologies of the ascites must be considered， including malignancy. Diagnostic paracentesis can be used to assess for infection as well as to seek an etiology of the ascites.\n\n【21】APPROACH TO：Liver Cirrhosis\n\n【22】DEFINITIONS\n\n【23】ASCITES： Abnormal accumulation (> 25 mL) of fluid within the peritoneal cavity.\n\n【24】CIRRHOSIS： Histologic diagnosis reflecting irreversible chronic hepatic injury， which includes extensive fibrosis and formation of regenerative nodules.\n\n【25】PORTAL HYPERTENSION： Increased pressure gradient (> 5 mm Hg) in the hepatic portal vein， usually resulting from resistance to portal flow and most com-monly caused by cirrhosis.\n\n【26】SPONTANEOUS BACTERIAL PERITONITIS： Bacterial infection of ascitic fluid without any primary intra-abdominal source of infection. Occurs in 10% to20% of cirrhotic patients with ascites.\n\n【27】CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【28】Pathophysiology\n\n【29】Cirrhosis represents the end stage of chronic hepatocellular injury that results in fibrosis and architectural distortion with nodular regeneration. With ongoing hepatocyte destruction， activated hepatic stellate cells promote collagen deposi-tion， resulting in a hardened， nodular liver that shrinks in size. Alcoholic cirrhosis is one of the most common forms of cirrhosis encountered in the United States. Quantity and duration of alcohol intake， as well as gender， genetic predisposi-tions， and concurrent chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection， contribute to the progression of alcoholic liver disease to cirrhosis. Other causes of cirrhosis are listed in Table 24-1.\n\n【30】When cirrhosis is suspected， patients should have an ultrasound of the right upper quadrant to assess for parenchymal changes， nodularity， hepatic cysts， and biliary ductal dilation. Histologic evaluation of tissue via percutaneous liver biopsy may be utilized for the pathologic diagnosis of cirrhosis and to differentiate the\n\n| Table 24-1·CAUSES OF CHRONIC HEPATITIS AND LIVER CIRRHOSIS  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Cause  | Test  |\n| Hepatitis C  | Anti-HCV Ab， presence of HCV RNA  |\n| Hepatitis B  | Persistent HBsAg，presence of HBeAg  |\n| Autoimmune  | ANA，anti-LKM (liver kidney microsomal)  |\n| Hemochromatosis  | High-transferrin saturation (> 45%)， high ferritin  |\n| Wilson disease  | Low serum ceruloplasmin  |\n| Alpha，-antitrypsin deficiency  | Low alpha，-antitrypsin enzyme activity  |\n\n【32】Abbreviations： Ab，antibody； ANA， antinuclear antibody； HBeAg， hepatitis B e antigen； HBsAg， hepatitis B surface antigen； HCV， hepatitis C virus.\n\n【33】etiology when it is not clear by history alone. This can be helpful to diagnose hemo-chromatosis， Wilson disease， and autoimmune hepatitis. Increasingly， noninvasive methods of diagnosis are being utilized， including elastography to assess the stiff-ness of liver tissue， which correlates with hepatocellular fibrosis. Another nonin-vasive test utilizes blood serum biomarker measurements to assign a fibrosis score correlating with the severity of the liver fibrosis.\n\n【34】Clinical Presentation\n\n【35】Advanced liver disease will show mild elevations in AST (aspartate aminotrans-ferase) and ALT (alanine aminotransferase)， with the AST：ALT ratio greater than2 in alcoholics， although advanced cirrhosis may eventually show normal trans-aminase levels due to loss of hepatocyte function. Total and direct bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase may be elevated as well. Cirrhosis will also show elevated pro-thrombin time， serum hypoalbuminemia， hyponatremia usually with ascites， and possibly electrolyte disturbances or impaired renal function. Patients also usually will have low platelets and macrocytic anemia.\n\n【36】Cirrhotic patients are classified by the presence or absence of complications. Compensated cirrhosis refers to patients without clinical symptoms beyond minor fatigue， muscle cramps， and itching. Decompensated cirrhosis refers to the presence of cirrhosis with complications， such as jaundice， ascites， hepatic encephalopathy， variceal bleeding， SBP， and hepatorenal syndrome. Many of these complications are driven by portal hypertension， which results from hepatocyte fibrosis causing sinusoidal resistance to portal venous flow， as well as increased splanchnic flow related to splanchnic vascular bed vasodilation.\n\n【37】Loss of functioning hepatic mass leads to jaundice as well as impaired syn-thesis of albumin (leading to edema) and clotting factors (leading to coagulopa-thy). Decreased liver production of steroid hormone-binding globulin leads to an increase in unbound estrogen manifested by spider angiomata， palmar erythema， and testicular atrophy and gynecomastia in men. Portal hypertension can also result in hypersplenism and splenomegaly， resulting in platelet sequestration.\n\n【38】Ascites may result as a consequence of portal venous hypertension related to cirrhosis. However， it may also be a result of exudative causes， such as infection (eg， tuberculous peritonitis) or malignancy. It is important to distinguish the cause of ascites in order to look for serious and/or reversible causes， such as malignancy， and to guide therapy. Ascitic fluid is obtained by paracentesis and examined for protein， albumin， cell count with differential， and culture. The first step in trying to deter-mine the cause of ascites is to determine whether it is caused by portal hyperten-sion or by an exudative process by calculating the SAAG .\n\n【39】Treatment\n\n【40】The treatment of ascites that is secondary to liver cirrhosis usually consists of dietary sodium restriction coupled with diuretics. Loop diuretics are often combined with spironolactone to provide effective diuresis and to maintain normal potassium levels.\n\n【41】Alcohol cessation is critical for those with alcoholic liver disease to prevent pro-gression to advanced cirrhosis. Sustained abstinence after diagnosis of cirrhosis\n\n| Table 24-2·COMPLICATIONS OF CIRRHOSIS  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Disorder  | Diagnosis  | Clinical Presentation  | Treatment  |\n| Portalhypertension  | Development of clini- cal features， visualiza-tion of varices andsplenomegaly onimaging， and evalu-ation of portal bloodflow using Doppler ultrasonography  | Ascites， splenomegaly， hypersplenism，encephalopathy，andbleeding varices  | Nonselective beta-blockerssuch as propranolol lowerportal pressure； for acute variceal bleed，intravenousoctreotide causes splanch-nic vasoconstriction.Whenmedically refractory，a transjugular intrahepaticportosystemic shunt (TIPS)can be inserted.  |\n| Ascites  | Finding of free perito-neal fluid on physicalexamination or on an imaging study  | Abdominal disten-tion， sometimes withperipheral edema  | Sodium restriction， spi- ronolactone； loop diuretics；large-volume paracentesis  |\n| Spontane-ous bacterialperitonitis  | Ascitic fluid contains>250 neutrophils/mm'and confirmedwith a positive cul-ture； most commonorganisms are Esch-erichia coli， Klebsiella，other enteric flora，enterococci  | Abdominal pain， distention， fever， decreased bowelsounds， or sometimesfew abdominal symp-toms but worsening encephalopathy  | Intravenous antibiotics，such as cefotaxime or ampicillin/sulbactam  |\n| Hepatic encephalopathy  | Clinical.

Ultimately， liver transplantation is the only definitive treatment for those with cirrhosis.\n\n【44】Patients being considered for transplant are stratified according to scoring systems to estimate disease severity and survival. The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease(MELD) score uses a patient's laboratory values for serum bilirubin， serum creati-nine， and the international normalized ratio (INR) for prothrombin time to pre-dict survival. An older scoring system， the Child-Turcotte-Pugh system， also classifies severity of disease， with class A having the best prognosis and class C the worst.\n\n【45】Prevention.

SBP is a relatively common complication of asci-tes. It is thought to be caused by translocation of gut flora into the peritoneal fluid. Symptoms include fever and abdominal pain， but often there is paucity of signs and symptoms. Diagnosis is established by paracentesis and finding more than250 neutrophils/mm’OR by a positive culture. Culture of ascitic fluid often fails to yield the organism (inserting fluid in a blood culture bottle raises the sensitivity from 40% to 90%). However， when positive， fluid cultures usually reveal a single organism， most often gram-negative enteric flora but occasionally enterococci or pneumococci. This is in contrast to secondary peritonitis (eg， as a consequence of intestinal perforation)， which usually is polymicrobial. Empiric therapy includes coverage for gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods， such as intravenous ampi-cillin/sulbactam， or a third-generation cephalosporin such as cefotaxime. Oral flu-r11n oroquinolones may also be used for uncomplicated SBP， but should be avoided in patients who were taking quinolones for SBP prophylaxis， as their organisms may be resistant. Patients who have had SBP in the past， or are considered high risk for SBP， should be maintained on a prophylactic regimen with an oral fluoroquinolone.\n\n【51】Esophageal and Gastric Variceal Bleeding. Other complications of advanced cir- rhosis with portal hypertension include esophageal and gastric variceal bleeding， which can result in massive hemorrhage and hemodynamic instability. Treatment may include infusion of octreotide to cause splanchnic vasoconstriction and reduce portal pressure. Esophageal varices can also be treated endoscopically with ligation or banding to treat or prevent bleeding or with sclerotherapy for active bleeding. In patients presenting with upper GI variceal bleed， the incidence of SBP is higher， and these patients should be initiated on antibiotic prophylaxis. Surgical or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) may also be placed to decompress portal pressure and reduce the bleeding risk as the patient awaits liver transplantation.\n\n【52】Hepatorenal Syndrome. Hepatorenal syndrome， which typically presents as pro-gressive decline in renal function in patients with significant ascites， can also present in advanced cirrhosis. The pathogenesis is poorly understood， though it is thought to be related to multifactorial renal vasoconstriction. Treatment is difficult， and prognosis is often poor unless patients proceed for liver transplantation.\n\n【53】Hepatic Encephalopathy. Hepatic encephalopathy is characterized by mental sta-tus changes， asterixis， and elevated ammonia levels related to loss of hepatic func-tion. It may be precipitated by numerous factors， including infection such as SBP， electrolyte disturbances (hypokalemia)， increased dietary protein load， and GI bleeding； it can also occur just after a TIPS procedure. Diagnosis is a clinical one Ca11S based on history and physical examination and by excluding other causes of confu-sion. Ammonia levels are variable in patients with hepatic encephalopathy and should not be relied on to make the diagnosis. Treatment is aimed at correcting underlying causes， as well as administration of lactulose， a nonabsorbable disaccha-ride that causes colonic acidification and elimination of nitrogenous waste. Other cathartic agents are also effective. Poorly absorbed antibiotics such as neomycin and rifaximin are used as adjuncts in refractory cases of hepatic encephalopathy.\n删除16：<u>CASE CORRELATION\n删除25：<u>See also Case 26 (Acute Hepatitis) and Case 27 (Painless Jaundice， Pancreatic Cancer).</u>\n</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Dislocations of the glenohumeral  删除换行1 (shoulder) joint occur when a large force is applied to the joint, tearing the stabilising joint  删除换行1 capsule and the surrounding tissues. There are three types of dislocation – anterior, posterior  删除换行1 and inferior – with the anterior type being most common. Radiographs are usually performed to confirm the diagnosis, but are not always required in recurrent cases.\n\n【15】Anterior dislocation is easily confirmed on the radiograph, but posterior dislocations are  删除换行1 sometimes missed due to the subtle signs on anteroposterior (AP) projection – there is a  删除换行1 characteristic ‘light bulb’ appearance of the humeral head. Inferior dislocations are rare but  删除换行1 associated with epilepsy and trauma with an abducted arm. The patient typically presents  删除换行1 with the arm fully abducted to 180 degrees and the elbow flexed – the ‘tea-pot’ position.\n\n【16】With shoulder dislocations, look for the following associated injuries:\n\n【17】1. A fracture of the greater tuberosity. This can be problematic as large fragments may  删除换行1 obstruct relocation and it is the site of rotator cuff muscle attachment.\n\n【18】2. The Bankart lesion. This is a tear of the anterior inferior part of the labrum and  删除换行1 sometimes a bony chip fragment may be visible on the radiograph.\n\n【19】3. The Hill–Sachs lesion. The posterior part of the humeral head may be fractured  删除换行1 against the glenoid rim as the humeral head is dislocated. It is visible as a ‘dent’ in  删除换行1 the humeral head on the radiograph.\n\n【20】4. Neurological injuries. The axillary nerve can be stretched and the patient may have  删除换行1 altered sensation over the regimental badge area. This usually recovers on reduction. Occasionally there may be an associated brachial plexus injury and this should  删除换行1 prompt immediate orthopaedic referral.\n\n【21】Management of simple anterior dislocation is usually straightforward. First, provide prompt  删除换行1 analgesia (Entonox, oral or intravenous), perform a focused neurological exam and confirm  删除换行1 the diagnosis radiographically. After that, a variety of techniques for reduction exist and these  删除换行1 must be centred on patient choice, pain perception and the experience of the clinician. Most  删除换行1 anterior dislocations, especially recurrent ones, can be reduced with only Entonox. Position  删除换行1 the patient sitting upright with the shoulder slightly abducted and the elbow supported and  删除换行1 flexed to 90 degrees. Gently externally rotate the humerus and the shoulder usually relocates.\nIf the shoulder has not reduced with full external rotation, adduct elbow over the chest wall  删除换行1 and internally rotate the arm to bring the wrist to lie on the opposite shoulder. This is referred  删除换行1 to as Kocher’s method. The key to all reductions is very slow movement and should the patient  删除换行1 be in pain, to stop and wait. Gentle traction downwards also helps if the humeral head is  删除换行1 wedged under the glenoid.\n\n【22】If the patient requires additional analgesia or chooses sedation, the patient must be moved to  删除换行1 the resuscitation room, and a practitioner trained in sedation using appropriate monitoring  删除换行1 must carry out the sedation whilst a second clinician carries out the reduction.\n\n【23】There are a number of other methods (e.g. traction only, scapular manipulation) for reduction and no single one has proved to be superior. Success is usually obtained with adequate  删除换行1 analgesia, relaxation and an experienced operator.\n\n【24】Neurovascular checks should be carried out pre- and post-procedure and documented. The  删除换行1 reduced shoulder should be immobilised in a collar and cuff sling or a poly-sling and a check 161\n\n【25】Case 45: My shoulder popped out 删除换行1 radiograph performed. The patient should follow up in a fracture clinic for rehabilitation. Warn  删除换行1 the patient not to fully abduct or externally rotate the arm as the shoulder may dislocate again.\n\n【26】If there is a pre-reduction neurological injury, an associated fracture or a failure of reduction  删除换行1 in the emergency department, orthopaedic referral should be made promptly.\n\n【27】Key Points\n\n【28】• Anterior dislocations are the most common type of shoulder dislocation.\n\n【29】• Assessment should include neurovascular checks pre- and post-reduction.\n\n【30】• The method of reduction should take into account pain, patient choice and the  删除换行1 experience of the clinician.\n\n【31】• Orthopaedic referral is mandated in complex fracture dislocations and neurological injury.删除9：<u>http://taylorandfrancis.com163</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The opening snap is usually accompanied by a loud first heart sound. It is absent when the valve is diffusely calcified. When only the tips of the leaflets are calcified， the opening snap persists.\n\n【44】What is the mechanism of a loud first heart sound?\n\n【45】The loud first heart sound occurs when the valve leaflets are mobile. The valve is open during diastole and is suddenly slammed shut by ventricular contraction in systole.\n\n【46】What is the mec2hanism of presystolic accentuationof the murmur?\n\n【47】In sinus rhythm it is caused by the atrial systole， which increases flow across the stenotic valve from the left atrium to the left ventricle (LV)； this causes accentuation of the loudness of the murmur. This may also be seen in atrial fibrillation and is explained by the turbulent flow caused by the mitral valve starting to close with the onset of ventricular systole. This occurs before the first heart sound and gives the impression of falling in late diastole. It is， however， caused by the start of ventricular systole.\n\n【48】What are the complications?\n\n【49】● Left atrial enlargement and atrial fibrillation\n\n【50】Systemic embolization， usually cerebral hemispheres\n\n【51】● Pulmonary hypertension\n\n【52】●Tricuspid regurgitation\n\n【53】·Right heart failure.\n\n【54】How does one determine clinically the severity of the stenosis?\n\n【55】· The narrower the distance between the second sound and the opening snap， the greater the severity.

The limp began following a fall from a play-ground structure， and has worsened to the point that the child is no longer willing to walk. The patient was treated two weeks ago for an acute otitis media with Aug-mentin， and he currently has a runny nose attributed to allergies. There have been no fevers， emesis， cough， abdominal pain， recent travel or insect bites.\n\n【1】His blood pressure is 95/68 mm Hg， pulse is 102 beats per minute， respira-tions are 20 breaths per minute， and temperature is 37.5℃(99.5°F). On physical examination， he is well appearing and his right hip is noted to be flexed with slight abduction and external rotation. The joint is warm to touch， and he resists passive range of motion testing. The right knee is normal， and there are no other findings on physical examination.\n\n【2】What is your next step?\n\n【3】What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【4】What is the best treatment for this problem?\n\n【5】 33：\n\n【6】Summary： The patient is a 6-year-old boy with right hip pain who is refusing to ambulate. He appears well with normal vital signs； his examination reveals decreased passive range of motion of the right hip.Best treatment for this problem： After excluding septic arthritis， osteomyelitis and other non-benign etiologies， treat for transient synovitis with NSAIDs and bed rest for 7 to 10 days.1\\. Recognize the clinical presentation of transient synovitis， and appreciate the simi-larities of its presentation to septic arthritis and other serious pathologies of limp.\n\n【7】2\\. Learn about the diagnosis and treatment of suspected septic arthritis.\n\n【8】3\\. Be familiar with the other etiologies of limp in a child.Transient synovitis is the most common cause of acute hip pain in children aged 3 to10 years old. The arthralgia is caused by a temporary inflammation of the synovium， the soft tissue that lines the non-cartilaginous surfaces of the hip joint. While the etiology is not clearly understood， the disease is suspected to be secondary to an infection as up to 50% of patients report a recent upper respiratory tract infection. Fever typically is absent but may occur. Most patients will complain of unilateral hip pain， and up to 5% will have bilateral pain. There is a male-to-female predominance of slightly more than 2：1.\n\n【9】While this case is a typical example of transient synovitis， the diagnosis not to miss is septic arthritis， an infection that can lead to rapid destruction of the articular joint cartilage. This disease can lead to long-term morbidity if not diagnosed early， and joints of the lower extremity are affected in more than 90% of the cases.Approximately 3% o AFf children who present to the emergency department for limp will have septic arthritis. Causative bacterial organisms vary with age group， but Staphylococcus aureus is the most common organism， followed by Group A Streptococcus (S pyogenes) and S pneumoniae. Kingella kingae has recently become a common pathogen in children younger than 3， and Neisseria gonorhoeae should be considered in neonates and sexually active adolescents. Empiric antibiotic cover-age should include an antistaphylococcal agent with gram-negative coverage added when age appropriate. Definitive treatment is by immediate surgical drainage and washout in addition to antibiotics.1\\. Age (age specific diagnoses)\n\n【10】2\\. Onset of pain (acute versus chronic)\n\n【11】3\\.

In a series of 95 children with septic arthritis， most had a low-grade fever， but one-third were afebrile at presentation. Absence of fever should not sway the clinician from the diagnosis.Synovial fluid analysis， which includes cell count， Gram stain， culture and sensi-tivity testing， may be required to distinguish between septic arthritis and transient synovitis. A synovial fluid white blood cell count of >50，000 cells/uL with a predom-inance (>90%) of polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes suggests septic arthritis. The Gram stain may rapidly identify the organism， and the culture and sensitivity results will allow the antibiotic regimen to be narrowed. Notably， synovial fluid has bacteriostatic effects， and organisms may not grow in the routine culture. The likeli-hood of identifying the organism can be improved by placing a synovial fluid sample in a blood culture medium. Finally， neonates and adolescents with a suspected septic arthritis should be tested for gonorrhea.A bone scan uses IV technetium 99m-labeled methylene diphosphate to identify areas of increased cellular activity and blood flow. This test can be useful to detect early Legg-Calve-Perthes disease， osteomyelitis， stress fractures， and osteoid osteo-mas. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be helpful in detecting osteomyelitis， early avascular necrosis， and bone malignancies. Computed tomography (CT) is rarely indicated for musculoskeletal complaints； however the test may be necessary when intra-abdominal entities， such as appendicitis， or pelvic etiologies are in the differential.\n\n【17】Ultrasound (US) is perhaps the most useful imaging study after plain films in the evaluation of the pediatric limp. Recent studies have demonstrated that the use of bedside ED ultrasound can reliably detect a joint effusion 删除33：<u></u>. In one series of 96 children who underwent hip US for possible septic arthritis， none of the 40 patients who had normal US findings were later discharged with the diagnosis of septic arthritis. Early detection of a joint effusion and ultrasound guid-ance of arthrocentesis can decrease the time to definitive diagnosis and treatment 删除换行4 of septic arthritis. Additionally， the detection of bilateral hip effusions raises the clinical suspicion for rheumatologic conditions and transient synovitis. One study showed that up to 25% of patients with transient synovitis have bilateral effusions.Septic Arthritis is most common in children <3 years old. The male-to-female ratio is 2：1. The hip is the most common site (80%) with the most common organ-ism being S aureus. Others： group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus， S pneumoniae， Haemophilus influenzea type B， Kingella kingae (after URI)， Salmonella (sickle cell patients)， Pseudomonas aeruginosa， Neisseria meningitidis， N gonorrhoeae， gram- negative bacilli. Pain in the affected joint， fever， edema， swelling， inability to bear weight， anorexia， irritability， pseudoparalysis may be presenting symptoms. There are no published clinical decision rules but a recent study notes that infection is indicated by： 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> inability to bear weight， 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> fever， 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> ESR >40 mm/h， 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> WBC>12，000/mm. Though the incidence is low， when present， IV antibiotics and surgical irrigation and debridement must be implemented immediately as disability due to destruction of joint tissue may ensue.\n删除3：<u>Figure 33-1. Ultrasound demonstrating a left hip effusion. The right hip is normal. The echogenic linear focus which courses along the left femoral neck is felt to represent periosteal new bone. An effusion is diagnosed when the distance between the anterior surface of the femoral neck and the posterior surface of the iliopsoas muscle is greater than 5 mm， or there is a greater than 2 mm difference from the contralateral hip. FH， femoral head； ASFN， anterior surface femoral head； PSIM， posterior surface iliopsoas muscle.</u>\n\n【18】Osteomyelitis of the femur or pelvis can present as hip pain. The proximal femur is the most common site of bone infection in children， and may also involve the joint given the intracapular location 删除33：<u></u>. On examination， there may be focal erythema， swelling， and warmth near the location of the metaphysis. Similar to septic arthritis， the presentation may be attenuated by the recent antibiotic use. Plain films may not show bony changes until 10 to 20 days after symptoms began. MRI is the ideal study with a sensitivity of 92% to 100%. The most common organ-isms are the same as those that cause septic arthritis， and patients with osteomyelitis require empiric antibiotic therapy and emergent orthopedic consultation for bone aspiration.\n\n【19】删除3：<u>Figure 33-2. An example of osteomyelitis of the left proximal femur， ischia， and iliac bones with associated left hip septic arthritis. There is also extensive myositis surrounding the left hip. There is possible pus under pressure or necrotic changes may be present in the left proximal fem ur.</u>\n\n【20】Legg-Calve-Perthes disease (vascular necrosis of the femoral head) develops when an insufficient blood supply to the femoral head leads to necrosis. It is com-monly found in boys aged 4 to 10 years， and its cause is unknown. The child usually presents with a limp and may complain of hip or knee pain. On physical exami-nation， the child will have decreased range of motion at the affected hip. X-rays may show fragmentation and then healing of the femoral head 删除33：<u></u>， and a bone scan will show decreased blood perfusion to the femoral head. Ten to twenty percent of patients will have bilateral disease， and the aim of treatment is to keep the femoral head within the acetabulum to allow healing to occur. A brace， cast， or splint may be required to immobilize the hip’s position. Patients should be referred to an orthopedist for possible surgical management.\n\n【21】Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis (SCFE) remains one of the most common disorders affecting the hip in adolescence. SCFE is characterized by the posterior displacement of the capital femoral epiphysis from the femoral neck through the growth plate. It is most common in obese boys aged 11 to 15 years. Children who grow rapidly and who have hormonal imbalances such as hypothyroidism and acro-megaly are also at risk. In addition to a limp， patients will complain of hip and/or knee pain. On examination， patients will have impaired internal rotation and passive hip flexion may be associated with compensatory external rotation. Plain films of the hip or pelvis will often show displacement of the femoral head， com-monly described as \"fallen ice cream from the cone\". Approximately 30% to 60%\n\n【22】删除3：<u>Figure 33-3. Avascular Necrosis of the Femoral HeadToddler's fracture is a nondisplaced fracture of the distal tibial shaft that occurs most commonly in a child younger than 2 years who is learning to walk. Frequently， there is no definite history of a traumatic event， and the child is brought to the office due to reluctance to bear weight on the leg. On physical examination， maximal tenderness can usually be elicited over the fracture site. On plain film， the typical findings are a nondisplaced hairline spiral fracture of the tibia and no fibular frac-ture. It is not uncommon for initial radiographs to be normal and the diagnosis of this fracture made several days after the injury when follow-up radiographs show a lucent line or periosteal reaction.</u>\n\n【23】Osgood-Schlatter syndrome is caused by a reaction of the bone and cartilage of the tibial tubercle to repetitive stress (eg， jumping) and is believed to represent tiny stress fractures in the apophysis. The condition is also associated with rapid growth spurts. Physical examination reveals tenderness and swelling over the tibial tubercle. Running， jumping， and kneeling worsen the symptoms. The condition is managed with ice， anti-inflammatory medication， and a decrease in activity. Daily stretching of the quadriceps and hamstrings is also beneficial. Patients with severe pain may require immobilization using crutches or a knee immobilizer. Individual regulation of activity is usually effective； pain may recur until the tubercle matures(ie， ossifies completely).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Pathologically it consists of  删除换行1 a thin membranous sheet attached peripherally to normal muscle at the point of origin  删除换行1 from the rib cage. It is generally described as upward displacement of one of side of  删除换行1 diaphragm, usually on left side without break of continuity, permitting one or more of  删除换行1 abdominal organs to occupy position in the thorax.\n\n【7】The condition was first described by Petit 通用删除7(英):<u>(1790)</u>. Cru-veilher in 1849 coined the  删除换行1 term eventration for the first time to differentiate this unusual malformation from  删除换行1 diaphragmatic hernia. The eventration was formerly an autopsy finding but it is now  删除换行1 roentgenographs which were proved subsequently to be eventration of diaphragm. Sailor  删除换行1 and Rheim in 1905 collected 13 cases. Bayne-Jones cade made the total number to that 删除换行1 date 108 as cited by Verbrycke. Some 300 cases were reported in the literature. Eventration  删除换行1 occurs most commonly on left side. It was also reported rarely on right side by various  删除换行1 authors. Bilateral eventration is very rare. Eventration of diaphragm is of interest not  删除换行1 because it is a rarity and its radiographic feature is sufficiently characteristic to allow the  删除换行1 correct diagnosis to be made with certainty but it may present puzzling problems to those  删除换行1 unfamiliar with the entity and has often led to unnecessary anxiety over treatment and  删除换行1 even needless surgical exploration.\n\n【8】Eventration of diaphragm is a congenital condition, sometimes it is difficult or  删除换行1 impossible to differentiate from diaphragmatic paralysis where marked diaphragmatic  删除换行1 elevation may be attributed to interruption of phrenic nerve by invasive neoplasm or  删除换行1 by surgical section. In many cases, however, there is no way of knowing whether rise  删除换行1 in the dome of diaphragm is caused by congenital absence of muscle or phrenic nerve  删除换行1 paralysis. In infants, for example, hemidiaphragmatic elevation may be attributed to birth  删除换行1 injury as well as to congenital abnormality of muscle and the only method of distinguishing  删除换行1 is by faradic stimulation of phrenic nerve.\n\n【9】Eventration is supposed to be much more infrequent than diaphragmatic hernia,  删除换行1 ratio being 1:37. Eventration is encountered at all ages. Eventration per se as may be  删除换行1 strikingly free from symptoms. Among symptomatic, three types of patients such as  删除换行1 pleuropulmonary, dyspeptic, and cardiac were reported. Korns also observed that  删除换行1 eventration of right hemidiaphragm was 7–8 times less common than that of the left.\nFluoroscopy usually shows marked restricted movement of hemidiaphragm with normal  删除换行1 respiration. On sniffing, paradoxical movement of hemidiaphragm can be seen; reverse  删除换行1 excursion of 2 cm or more can be diagnostic of eventration.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

She has already visited numerous dermatology practitioners and one parasitology specialist, who could not identify any ecto-parasites (i.e. those infesting visible parts of the body). Her medical history included well-controlled hypertension and chronic back pain.\n\n【12】During the examination, Ms. White requested that you search her skin from head to toes for evidence of living and/or dead parasites. When you offered a topical anti-parasitic agent as empirical therapy (i.e. not as proof of existing parasitosis but on a trial-and-error basis), she showed no interest. In fact, all attempts at initiating her on empirical therapy were rejected, including suggestions regarding relatively benign medications such as permethrin/Crotamiton cream or lotion (Eurax®) and anti-psychotic therapy for formication symptoms. You felt puzzled and a little bit frustrated. Seeing this, she tearfully stated, “You don’t understand, Doctor! I have been very miserable for 2 years because of these bugs. I do not want to take any drugs until I know that is living underneath my skin. Could you please help me find them to prove that I’m not crazy? Then we can try to get rid of them.”\n\n【13】Reflections on the Case\n-----------------------\n\n【14】For a couple of reasons, Ms. Daisy’s interest in therapy pales in comparison with her investment in conceptual validation of her delusional parasitosis. As she is met with disbelief those not sharing the same delusional ideation, her desire to have such ideation validated becomes even stronger. In the experience of the authors, cerebral patients who seem proud of their intellectual capability frequently end up in this situation. It is very challenging for you to entice them to undergo treatment by the possibility of symptomatic relief, simply because the actual symptoms do not bother them as much as not having a satisfactory explanation for such symptoms. On the other hand, as a practitioner you should tactfully avoid providing conceptual validation because doing so can render their delusions even more rigid to the point of being completely non-negotiable.\n\n【15】Teaching Points\n---------------\n\n【16】The term “ hopelessly delusional” denotes a special type of patients at one extreme of the SDI: those who are so antagonistic and frequently hostile from the start that there is no room for communication or negotiation. Luckily, these patients are rare, and most of them are this way because their delusional ideation were rejected or invalidated by a healthcare professional at some point during the course of their disease. The authors believe that showing such patients a positive attitude can help minimize the degree of “negative transference.”\n\n【17】The word “transference” used to describe this phenomenon should not be confused with its use in a classical Freudian sense, whereby transfer of life-long feelings and perceptions is from parental figures to other authority figures. Here we refer to the transfer of feelings from the previous practitioner(s) to you. If you notice persistence of an overtly hostile attitude, the negative transference is creating problems for your relationship with the patient. As such, it is important to explicitly and diplomatically challenge the patient to reconsider her preconceived notions about you, and often the patient realizes that her negative perceptions and feelings are unwarranted. Upon such realization, some patients may even feel embarrassed.\n\n【18】Some patients are relatively hopeless they have already done such an extensive research on topics involving parasitosis that it is almost impossible to try to change their mind. The author (JK) has encountered rare patients who researched this topic so thoroughly that they even anticipated the author’s approach (i.e. challenging and trying to modify their thinking to make it more favorable toward empirical therapy). There is not a perfect way to handle this situation, and it might be best to be honest about how you feel and find a way to part with the patient in peace, “Ms. Daisy, I am not convinced that we have uncovered the truth about your skin disease. As such, I am interested in helping you explore the true cause of your crawling, biting, and stinging sensations. In terms of what I can do to help you feel better, it is your decision to take or not to take this medication. However, I have done my best at this point. I wish there were something else I could do to improve your condition", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Practical strategies to promote adherence and optimize GDMT include 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 6 , 31 , 39 \\]</u>:\n\n【9】   Prioritize therapies with the greatest therapeutic benefit: ARNI, beta blockers, AA/MRA, and SGLT2 inhibitors.\n   Initiate medications at low doses and up-titrate as tolerated.\n   Minimize diuretics to the lowest possible dose to maintain euvolemia.\n   Avoid medication up-titration if volume depleted or HF decompensated.\n   Schedule medication dosing to avoid excessive fluctuations in blood pressure or hypotension.\n   Monitor renal function, electrolytes, and cardiac-specific biomarkers (BNP, NTproBNP, Troponin) to assess for HF exacerbation and aide clinical decision making.\n   Assess affordability and access to prescribed medication regimen.\n   Reconcile medications at every visit.

Include caregivers in patient education.\n\n【10】### 6.5.8 Adjunctive Therapies\n\n【11】Patients with HFrEF may benefit from adjunctive therapies to augment GDMT and improve quality of life. Revascularization procedures are recommended for patients with coronary ischemia, suitable coronary anatomy, and viable myocardium. Hyperkalemia is a clinical adverse effect of RAAS inhibition, often limiting initiation or up-titration of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, AA/MRAs, or ARNI. Potassium binders may be considered to allow continuation of GDTM. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation is a reasonable consideration to reduce mortality and cardiovascular hospitalizations. Mitral valve surgery or transcatheter mitral valve repair is indicated for patients with secondary, or functional, mitral regurgitation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】Many adjunctive therapies have not improved outcomes in the HFrEF population. Anticoagulation is not recommended without the presence of comorbid conditions, such as atrial fibrillation or prior thrombotic/embolic event. Statins are not beneficial when solely prescribed for the diagnosis of heart failure. Nutritional supplementation and hormonal therapies, other than to correct confirmed deficiencies, are not recommended. Continuous inotropic infusions are not indicated except for palliation or as a “bridge” to advanced therapies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Medications known to adversely influence the clinical status of patients with HFrEF should be avoided, including calcium channel blockers, most antiarrhythmic medications, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and thiazolidinediones 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】### 6.5.9 Nonpharmacological Interventions\n\n【14】In addition to standard medical therapy, nonpharmacological interventions managed collaboratively by the primary care and cardiology clinicians can augment HF patient stability, quality of life, adherence, and patient engagement in self-care .\nTable 6.8 删除换行 Nonpharmacologic interventions for heart failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 40 \\]</u>\n\n| Individualized patient education  |\n| --- |\n| Weight management  |\n| Physical activity/cardiac rehabilitation  |\n| Smoking cessation  |\n| Alcohol moderation/restriction  |\n| Avoid excessive sodium intake  |\n| Fluid restriction (as indicated)  |\n| Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for sleep apnea  |\n| Primary disease prevention screenings (mammogram, colonoscopy, etc.)  |\n| Influenza/pneumococcal/COVID-19 vaccination  |\n\n【16】### 6.5.10 Device Therapy\n\n【17】The therapeutic benefits of device therapy for the treatment of HFrEF are well established and a subset of patients will be candidates for implantable devices once GDMT is optimized 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 41 – 43 \\]</u>. Implantable device therapy should only be considered in patients receiving optimal GDMT.\n\n【18】Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) protect HF patients from sudden cardiac death (SCD) due to cardiac dysrhythmias; however, frequent shocks may decrease quality of life and result in significant stress and anxiety 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Use of antiarrhythmic medications, catheter ablation of arrhythmogenic myocardium, and refined ICD and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) programming can decrease the frequency of dysrhythmias requiring shocks to restore normal sinus rhythm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】Wearable cardiac defibrillators (WCD) are available for patients at risk for sudden cardiac death who do not qualify for ICD implantation. WCDs provide an option for protection when the risk of SCD is unclear, such as after acute MI and coronary revascularization procedures in the setting of low EF, prior to initiation of GDMT, those awaiting mechanical circulatory support implantation and/or cardiac transplantation, and patients with an active contraindication to device implantation, such as infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 44 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】In approximately one third of patients, HF progression is associated with a prolongation of the QRS interval and asynchronous contraction between the right and left ventricle, resulting in decreased efficiency of cardiac performance.

This patient is presenting with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), the cancer most frequently associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation and bleeding diatheses. Typically these patients present with anemia, fatigue, and bleeding. The age of this patient points to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), and the image confirms that this patient has the promyelocytic type by showing abundant promyelocytes with azurophilic granules. APL can often be treated by differentiating the malignant cells into mature neutrophils, which have a life span of approximately seven days. The cells harbor a t (15; 17) translocation, making the retinoic acid receptor responsible for their transformation, and the cells can be differentiated using high-dose all-trans retinoic acid.  \nAnswer B is incorrect. Cytarabine is a nucle-otide analog that is incorporated into DNA, subsequently inhibiting DNA polymerase and RNA polymerase. It is used to treat AML, but is not as specific or effective in APL therapy.  \nAnswer C is incorrect. Daunorubicin is an anthracycline that inhibits topoisomerase II and intercalates into DNA, preventing relegation during mitosis and, in turn, introducing double-strand breaks. It is used in acute lymphocytic leukemia and AML, but is not as specific or helpful in treating APL.  \nAnswer D is incorrect. Fludarabine is an ATP\n\n【6】analog that inhibits DNA polymerase, DNA primase, and RNA reductase, blocking DNA synthesis. It is often used to treat chronic lymphocyte leukemia. It can also be used to treat AML, but is not specific to APL.  \nAnswer E is incorrect. Irinotecan is a topoisomerase I inhibitor, preventing ligation of single-strand breaks when it forms a complex with DNA and this enzyme. As the cell attempts to replicate its DNA, much damage is done when DNA polymerase encounters the complex, leading to cell death. Again, this drug is not specific to APL.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

They are sometimes difficult to detect. Older children can increase their intraabdominal pressure by coughing, and examining them standing up may help. The position of  删除换行1 the testes must be noted because, if retractile, they can be mistaken for a hernia. In girls the  删除换行1 contents of the hernial sac are often adherent within the sac and hence not reducible – a sliding hernia – and a fallopian tube or ovary may be palpable. The commonest cause of a swelling in the groin is a lymph node, but they are usually small and mobile, and lie more inferior  删除换行1 and lateral than an inguinal hernia. They may also be confused with a retractile testis. An  删除换行1 ultrasound can help. Direct and femoral hernias are rare in children.\n\n【12】In adults, inguinal hernias are associated with a muscular weakness or defect, but in children  删除换行1 they usually result from persistent patency of the processus vaginalis (PV). This accompanies  删除换行1 the testis as it exits the abdomen and descends into the scrotum and is obliterated by, or  删除换行1 soon after, birth. Failure of obliteration can occur anywhere along its length, explaining the  删除换行1 range of presentations 删除33：<u></u>. A hydrocoele is the fluid within the tunica vaginalis –  删除换行1 the remnant of the PV that surrounds the testis. Hydrocoeles transilluminate. They usually  删除换行1 resolve spontaneously by the age of 12 months and, if not, should be referred to a surgeon.\nFifty per cent of inguinal hernias present in the first year of life, most by the age of 6 months.\n\n【13】Peritoneal 删除换行1 cavity\n\n【14】Obliterated 删除换行1 processus 删除换行1 vaginalis\n\n【15】Vas deferens\n\n【16】Tunica 删除换行1 vaginalis\n\n【17】Testis\n\n【18】Scrotal 删除换行1 sac\n\n【19】Normal Inguinal hernia Hydrocoele\n\n【20】删除3：<u>Figure 34.1 Schematic diagram of development of inguinal hernia and hydrocoele.</u>\nCase 34: A lump in the groin\n删除26：<u>!</u> Children at risk of inguinal hernia\n\n【21】• Pre-term infants – especially those with very low birth weight (~30 per cent affected)\n\n【22】• Boys – outnumber girls 6:1 because ovaries do not leave the abdominal cavity\n\n【23】• Infants with chronic lung disease\n\n【24】• Children with conditions associated with abnormal abdominal fluid or increased  删除换行1 intra-abdominal pressure\n\n【25】• Children with developmental urogenital anomalies\n\n【26】• Infants with disorders of sexual development – phenotypically female infants with  删除换行1 inguinal hernias, especially bilateral, should be examined carefully to exclude  删除换行1 complete androgen insensitivity syndrome, an extremely rare but crucial diagnosis\n\n【27】Treatment is surgical.

Many laboratories consider a level of 4 ng/mL to be the upper limit of normal, but  删除换行1 practice varies. As there is considerable overlap in PSA levels associated with cancer and  删除换行1 benign conditions, and because neither DRE nor most imaging modalities used to visualise  删除换行1 the prostate (transrectal ultrasound or MRI) are sensitive or specific enough, transrectal or  删除换行1 transperineal core biopsies of the prostate are required to confirm the diagnosis.\nMicroscopic examination of the prostate biopsies in this man showed prostatic carcinoma.\nThe volume (length or percentage of tumour per biopsy) and degree of tumour differentiation  删除换行1 are also determined microscopically. Gleason patterns are graded from 1 to 5, with patterns  删除换行1 1 and 2 rarely encountered. Pattern 3 is the most common (well differentiated), followed by  删除换行1 pattern 4 (moderately differentiated) and pattern 5 (poorly differentiated). The Gleason score  删除换行1 is the sum of the two most prevalent and/or most aggressive growth patterns seen in the  删除换行1 tumour. Cancer diagnosed on needle biopsies typically is assigned a Gleason score between  删除换行1 6 (least aggressive) and 10 (most aggressive). For example, a tumour showing a predominant  删除换行1 pattern 3 and some pattern 4 would be recorded as Gleason score 3+ 4 = 7. A tumour with  删除换行1 a predominant pattern 3 and some patterns 4 and 5 would be recorded as Gleason score  删除换行1 3 + 5 = 8 to include the worst area of the tumour in the score.\nProstate cancer is the most common cancer of men and is typically slow growing, with many  删除换行1 men remaining asymptomatic and eventually dying of unrelated conditions. A minority of prostate cancers are aggressive and may spread to bone, especially the lumbar vertebrae, or lymph  删除换行1 nodes. The aetiology of prostate cancer is not well understood, but several risk factors such as  删除换行1 increased age, family history and diet are suspected. Prostate cancer is androgen-dependent, and  删除换行1 anti-androgen agents or even oestrogens may be used for treating advanced prostate cancer.\nManagement options for prostate cancer include active surveillance, surgery, radiotherapy or  删除换行1 hormonal therapy. Cancer that is considered to be low risk (low Gleason score, low volume,  删除换行1 and confined to the prostate) can in many cases be safely managed through active surveillance. This typically consists of annual PSA tests and future re-biopsy or earlier re-biopsy if  删除换行1 the PSA level increases rapidly.\nSurgery is usually recommended to those men where the expected benefit of prostatectomy  删除换行1 outweighs the risk of side effects such as erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence.\nModern surgical techniques have limited the extent of such adverse effects, and in younger  删除换行1 men with higher-risk cancer (larger volume or high Gleason score) that is confined to the  删除换行1 prostate, prostatectomy tends to be the best option. Radiotherapy or hormonal treatment is  删除换行1 most often used in cases of advanced cancer or those cases where tumour recurs following  删除换行1 potentially curative surgical treatment.\nKEY POINTS \n\n【7】• Although an elevated PSA and abnormal DRE may suggest prostate cancer, histological examination of a prostate biopsy is required for confirmation of the  删除换行1 diagnosis and determination of important factors, which will affect prognosis and  删除换行1 management decisions.\n• Depending on the grade and stage of prostate cancer, management options  删除换行1 range from active surveillance to surgery, radiotherapy and hormonal treatment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

She has a 15-year history of myasthenia gravis， and is currently receiving pyridostigmine， 800mg/day. She was on Prednisone 10 mg/day until about a month ago for her myasthenic symptoms. But as her symptoms improved， her steroids were discontinued.\n\n【2】The patient's past-surgical history include a bronchoscopy and medi-astinoscopy 12 years ago followed by a thymectomy a few weeks later. She reports that she was on the ventilator in the ICU afterward on both occasions.\n\n【3】 What preoperative information is important in the patient with myasthenia gravis?\n\n【4】 What is the most important point to remember when anesthetizing a patient with myasthenia gravis?\n\n【5】What are the major postoperative concerns in patients with myas-thenia gravis?\n\n【6】Summary： A 49-year-old woman presents for a sigmoid colectomy. She suffers from myasthenia gravis， and was intubated postoperatively following surgery for a thymectomy.\n\n【7】\\> Important preoperative information： The preoperative information impor-tant in a patient suffering from myasthenia gravis includes a history related to the severity of the disease， any related deficits， the patient’s baseline activity level， and any evidence of pharyngeal muscle dysfunction. It is important to understand her medication regimen， and the need for and/or frequency of plasmapheresis. A review of any previous anesthetic records is also important， and can provide useful information as to the dosage of drugs required. Pulmonary function tests are useful to estimate the likelihood of a need for postoperative ventilation， any extra-thoracic compression of the airway caused by the thymus， and the degree of restrictive lung disease.\n\n【8】\\> Anesthesia with myasthenia gravis： Patients with myasthenia gravis are exquisitely sensitive to nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers. Markedly reduced doses， perhaps even as little as 1/10 of the usual dose of a nonde-polarizing muscle relaxant is commonly sufficient. However， the response to neuromuscular blockers is variable， and can be affected by pyridostig-mine. Therefore， the administration of small doses of muscle relaxant to determine a patient's requirement is of paramount importance.\n\n【9】\\> Major postoperative concerns： The major postoperative concerns include assessing the need for prolonged ventilation， the ability to clear secretions， and optimizing the patient's medication regimen.\n\n【10】ANALYSIS\n\n【11】Objectives\n\n【12】1\\. Acquaint the learner with the items in the preoperative evaluation that are particularly important in a patient with myasthenia gravis.\n\n【13】2\\. Understand how the pathophysiology of myasthenia gravis affects anes-thetic drugs and the anesthetic plan.\n\n【14】3\\. Be able to anticipate the most common postoperative concerns in the myasthenic patient.\n\n【15】4\\. Become familiar with the perioperative issues encountered in a patient with multiple sclerosis.\n\n【16】Considerations\n\n【17】This patient is suffering from myasthenia gravis which has profound implica-tions on the conduct of anesthesia for a sigmoid colectomy. It is important to carefully study her old anesthetic records， to asses her responses to the anes-thetic technique， drugs， and doses which were used. This aides the anesthesi-ologist in optimizing the doses of anesthetic， in an attempt to minimize the likelihood or duration of postoperative ventilation. Following her previous surgeries， she required postoperative ventilation and admission to the ICU. However， the second surgery， a thymectomy， was performed with the intent of improving her myasthenia. So in this case， the history of requiring postoper-ative ventilation may or may not predict her requirements following this operation.\n\n【18】The physical examination should focus on the neurological system. Any neurological deficits should be documented. Special attention should be paid to her ability to cough and clear secretions， since pharyngeal muscles are often involved in this disease.\n\n【19】Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) help delineate the degree of restrictive pulmonary disease. Both myasthenia， and its treatment can cause respiratory muscle weakness， hindering the ability to extubate the patient at the end of the procedure. Studies have shown that a preoperative vital capacity of < 2.9 L， and a reduced FEV.25-75 of <3.0 L/sec predict a need for postoperative ventilation. In myasthenics with an intact thymus， flow volume loops may also be required to assess any extrathoracic compression to the airway.\n\n【20】Some poorly-controlled patients with myasthenia gravis may need preoperative plasmapheresis to reduce the patient’s antibody load before surgery. Most anesthesiologists do not make any changes to the patient’s medication regimen on the day of surgery， although some choose to omit pyridostigmine on the morning of the surgery to reduce the need for neu-romuscular blockers.\n\n【21】Given the surgical procedure， a general endotracheal anesthetic is appro-priate. Long-acting neuromuscular blocking agents should be minimized. A low-dose lumbar epidural technique may provide sufficient relaxation and allow nondepolarizing muscle relaxants to be avoided all together， in addition to providing postoperative analgesia. Standard monitoring utilizing ECG， pulse oximetry， urine output， and blood pressure is adequate for this patient. If however， on the basis of history and PFTs postoperative ventilation is antic-ipated， then an arterial line may be inserted to enable blood gas sampling as she is weaned from the ventilator.\n\n【22】Since her medication regimen includes steroids， providing a stress dose of perioperative steroids may be appropriate under these circumstances.\n\n【23】Myasthenia Gravis/Multiple Sclerosis\n\n【24】DEFINITIONS\n\n【25】DEPOLARIZING MUSCLE RELAXANTS (DMR)： Depolarizing muscle relaxants act by actually binding to the acetylcholine receptors and blocking access of the drug to the receptors. In the process of binding， the receptor is activated causing depolarization that is usually visible as fasciculations or brief muscle contractions. Succinylcholine is a depolarizing muscle relaxant. The action of succinylcholine is terminated by pseudocholinesterase， an enzyme found in the blood and hence its action lasts for only a few minutes.\n\n【26】NONDEPOLARIZING MUSCLE RELAXANTS (NDMR)： Nondepolarizing muscle relaxants bind to acetylcholine receptors in a reversible manner and act by blocking the access of acetylcholine to the receptors on the motor end plate. NDMRs do not activate the receptor in the process， so neither depolar-ization nor fasciculations occur.\n\n【27】ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE INHIBITORS： Acetylcholinesterase is an enzyme that is responsible for breaking down acetylcholine. Drugs that block this enzyme， known as cholinesterase inhibitors， result in more acetylcholine being available. This reverses the effect of the nondepolarizing muscle relax-ants in a competitive manner. The most commonly used acetylcholinesterase inhibitor in anesthesia is neostigmine. Other acetylcholinesterase inhibitors include edrophonium， prostigmine， and pyridostigmine. Pyridostigmine can be taken orally and is the drug of choice in the treatment of myasthenia gravis.\n\n【28】CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【29】Myasthenia Gravis\n\n【30】Anesthesiologists should consider the impact of the patient’s muscular weak-ness on the anesthetic technique they choose. Volatile anesthetics cause some muscular weakness intraoperatively， an effect that is exaggerated in patients with myasthenia. A similar muscle-relaxing action is associated with neuraxial anesthetic technique such as epidural or spinal. Not always sufficient for surgi-cal relaxation in normal patients， either volatile anesthetics or an epidural may provide sufficient relaxation in myasthenic patients. Allowing the nondepolar-izing muscle relaxants to be used sparingly or avoided all together minimizes the possibility of prolonged paralysis associated with their use.\n\n【31】Regional anesthetics can also be performed without neuromuscular block-ing agents， and some also provide excellent postoperative pain relief. However， it is important to take into consideration the patient's preference for remaining awake (or not) and the surgeon’s comfort and speed. It is 删除换行1 important to be cognizant that epidurals and spinals can impair respiratory effort if the motor and sensory levels rise high enough to impair the efficient working of the intercostal muscles.\n\n【32】Intubation is usually accomplished with succinylcholine， a depolarizing mus-cle relaxant. Using succinylcholine avoids the need for an intubating dose of a NDMR， and it’s possible that no NDMR will be needed for the operation. The onset of succinylcholine's action may be delayed in myasthenic patients because of blockade of acetylcholine receptors by antibodies. In contrast， succinyl-choline's duration of action may be prolonged since it is metabolized by plasma pseudocholinesterase， which is also inhibited by anticholinesterase medications. Preoperative plasmapheresis may also deplete plasma pseudocholinesterase lev-els. The bottom line： the action of succinylcholine is unpredictable， and affected by a number of factors in patients with myasthenic gravis.\n\n【33】In the event that the myasthenic patient is bed or wheelchair bound， or where succinylcholine would be otherwise contraindicated， it may well be possible to intubate the patient with no muscle relaxant at all， or perhaps with the aid of a volatile agent.\n\n【34】Neuromuscular monitoring is indicated in patients with myasthenia gravis. Before the administration of any muscle relaxants， the presence of fade in the Train of Four predicts a reduced requirement for nondepolarizing muscle relaxants (NDMR) in myasthenic patients. NDMRs normally induce a fade response， where the height of the first twitch T1 is greater than the second twitch T2 >T3 >T4. During the case， it is imperative to dose NDMRs to provide adequate surgical relaxation without abolishing of all the twitches. This requires that NDMRs be used sparingly if at all， and long-acting NDMRs such as pancuronium and doxacurium should absolutely be avoided. Similarly， mivacurium， although one of the shortest acting NDMRs， is relatively contraindicated because it is dependent upon plasma pseudocholinesterase for its metabolism. If required， short- and intermediate-acting NDMRs like vecuronium or cisatracurium are appropriate. Myasthenics usually require 40% to 50% of the usual dose of vecuro-nium. But since the individual's response can be so variable， the administration of very small doses， in succession if necessary， is appropriate.\n\n【35】The anesthesiologist must be aware of other drugs that may affect neuro-muscular transmission. These include magnesium， corticosteroids， aminogly-coside antibiotics， lithium， and beta blockers. Similarly， some drugs inhibit pseudocholinesterase， including echothiophate eye drops and donepezil(Aricept). Many of these drugs can increase neuromuscular blockade and make matters worse for the myasthenic patient.\n\n【36】Extubation of myasthenic patients requires careful evaluation. First and foremost， the patient's muscle strength must support spontaneous ventilation， and he or she must be able to handle and clear secretions. This usually means that there is no fade on the Train of Four (TOF)， or at least a return to the patient's baseline. The patient must be able to sustain a negative inspiratory pressure of at least 12 to 15 cm of water， able to lift his or her head off the pillow for at least 5 seconds， and obey commands prior to extubation.\n\n【37】On the other hand， the administration of neostigmine to reverse neuromus-cular blockade， especially in patients already on large doses of pyridostigmine， can lead to a cholinergic crisis resulting from an exaggerated activation of nicotinic and muscarinic cholinergic receptors. Excessive salivation， miosis， bronchoconstriction， bradycardia， muscle weakness， jitteriness， muscle twitch-ing， bowel cramps， nausea， urinary and bowel incontinence are some of the signs and symptoms of cholinergic crisis. The administration of anticholiner-gics like glycopyrrolate or atropine may mask the muscarinic actions during a cholinergic crisis， allowing nicotinic effects such as muscle weakness and twitching to predominate. Such nicotinic signs and symptoms are difficult to differentiate from an inadequate NDMR reversal， and from myasthenia itself. In order to avoid such confusion， many anesthesiologists avoid reversing resid-ual NDMR paralysis. Instead they rely on careful dosing and the patient to remain intubated on the ventilator until all the NDMR's effects have resolved.\n\n【38】Multiple Sclerosis\n\n【39】Another neuromuscular disorder commonly encountered by anesthesiologists is multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is a demyelinating disease which affects neurons in unpredictable patterns. Because of the nature of this disorder， any neurological deficits should be carefully noted and documented preoper-atively， and the patient made aware of all preexisting deficits.\n\n【40】The most common perioperative concern in patients with MS is the pos-sibility of an exacerbation of the disease after surgery. Any stressful condition， such as fever/hyperpyrexia， infection， pain， or fatigue may cause an exacerba-tion or relapse. It is very difficult to separate the effects of these factors from the effects of the stress of the surgery itself， or the anesthetic techniques or drugs that are used. It is important that the patient must be kept at normal body temperature in the operating room， since excessive heat seems to be harmful in this group of patients.\n\n【41】Avoiding the stress of postoperative pain is similarly a priority. Although the rationale is not understood， epidural analgesia is thought to be associated with fewer relapses of multiple sclerosis than a spinal. An epidural catheter can be placed in the preoperative period to provide postoperative analgesia and reduce cateecholamine release and pain. Amide localanesthetics like bupivacaine0.125% with the addition of a small amount of narcotic like hydromorphone10 ug/cc can provide excellent postoperative pain relief. Ester-based local anes-thetics may also be used， bearing in mind that many of them are metabolized by pseudocholinesterase. Patients on pyridostigmine have reduced plasma pseudo-cholinesterase activity and hence normally short-acting ester-based local anes-thetics like chloroprocaine may have an unpredictable duration of action.\n\n【42】Although epidural local anesthetics can cause some degree of motor weak-ness， bupivacaine 0.125% or 0.067% concentrations at rates of 4 to 10 cc/h should not cause appreciable motor block. It is important to titrate to analgesia 删除换行1 and perform periodical neurological checks to ensure significant motor blocks do not set in. Alternatively， patient controlled analgesia (PCA) can also be used in the postoperative period. Use of non-opioid oral and parenteral anal-gesics like ketorolac， ibuprofen， acetaminophen are desirable as they offer good analgesia without appreciable postoperative nausea， vomiting， sedation， or respiratory depression.\n\n【43】Postoperative Management\n\n【44】If the patient cannot be safely extubated in the operating room， she must be transferred to an intensive care unit or PACU where close monitoring is pos-sible and a plan to wean the patient off the ventilator in place. Prolonged postoperative ventilation is undesirable， since it is often associated with respiratory infections， resulting in more difficulties with extubation later on. Postoperatively a complete neurological examination must be performed to document any new deficits.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

She has macroscopic haematuria, hypertension and impaired renal function. The palpable abdominal  删除换行1 masses in both flanks have the characteristic features of enlarged kidneys. They are ballottable and resonant to percussion because of overlying bowel. The other principal causes for  删除换行1 palpable kidneys are renal cell carcinoma and massive hydronephrosis. Rest is the best management for cyst bleeding. Gross haematuria rarely lasts for more than a week.\n\n【23】ADPKD is the most common inherited renal disease, occurring in approximately 1:600 to  删除换行1 1:1000 individuals. Although the name ‘ADPKD’ is derived from renal manifestations of cyst  删除换行1 growth leading to enlarged kidneys and renal failure, this is a systemic disorder manifested  删除换行1 by the presence of hepatic cysts, diverticular disease, inguinal hernias, mitral valve prolapse,  删除换行1 intracranial aneurysms and hypertension. Flank pain is the most common symptom and  删除换行1 may be caused by cyst rupture, cyst infection or renal calculi. Macroscopic haematuria due  删除换行1 to cyst haemorrhage occurs commonly and usually resolves spontaneously. Renal calculi  删除换行1 occur in approximately 20 per cent of ADPKD patients (most commonly uric acid stones).\nHypertension occurs early in the course of this disease, affecting 60% of patients with normal  删除换行1 renal function. Approximately 50% of ADPKD patients will develop end-stage renal failure.\n\n【24】Although it is not known if this patient’s father had renal disease, it is highly likely that he  删除换行1 had ADPKD and an associated ruptured berry aneurysm as the cause for his subarachnoid  删除换行1 haemorrhage. The patient’s uncle required a renal transplant. The pattern of inheritance in  删除换行1 this family is consistent with an autosomal dominant trait.\n\n【25】Ultrasound is the preferred initial screening technique as it is cheap, non-invasive and rapid.\nIt detects cysts as small as 0.5 cm. For a certain diagnosis, there should be at least three renal  删除换行1 cysts with at least one cyst in each kidney. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are more sensitive techniques for detecting smaller cysts. Ultrasound  删除换行1 in this patient shows the typical appearance of multiple cysts (black areas) surrounded by  删除换行1 thickened walls 删除33：<u></u>. She should be referred to a nephrologist for long-term followup of her renal failure, and plans should be made for renal replacement therapy. She needs to  删除换行1 have effective blood pressure control with diastolic pressure less than 85mmHg to retard the  删除换行1 progression of her renal failure. Clinical trials are starting of vasopressin receptor antagonists, which show promise at inhibiting cyst growth.\n\n【26】She should have MRI angiography to exclude an intracranial aneurysm. This is not advocated  删除换行1 for all ADPKD patients but is indicated for those patients with a positive family history of  删除换行1 aneurysm rupture. The patient’s children should have their blood pressure checked and later  删除换行1 be screened by ultrasound. By age 30 years, 90% of ADPKD patients will have cysts detectable  删除换行1 by ultrasound.\n\n【27】Ninety per cent of ADPKD patients have mutations in the ADPKD1 gene. This gene encodes  删除换行1 for the protein polycystin, which is a membrane glycoprotein that probably mediates cell–cell  删除换行1 or cell–matrix interactions. Most remaining patients have mutations in the ADPKD2 gene,  删除换行1 which codes for polycystin-2, which has structural homology to polycystin and to calcium  删除换行1 channels. ADPKD1 patients generally have an earlier age of onset of hypertension and development of renal failure as compared to ADPKD2 patients.Case 26: Loin Pain and Haematuria\n\n【28】KEY POINTS\n\n【29】•\t Patients with ADPKD are often asymptomatic.\n\n【30】•\t ADPKD patients may present with loin pain or haematuria.\n\n【31】•\t ADPKD is the commonest familial cause of renal failure.\n\n【32】•\t ADPKD is the most likely cause of bilateral renal masses.\n\n【33】•\t Family members who may have ADPKD should be advised to have their blood pressure measured and a renal ultrasound.\n\n【34】删除3：<u>Figure 26.1 Renal ultrasound demonstrating multiple cysts.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The clinician must rule out a cardiac condition (despite the mild success with antacid medication)， pulmonary problem， ulcer， hepatitis， and infection. Since the guaiac was positive， a follow-up FOBT\n\n【43】and/or colonoscopy should be done， especially if the patient has not had a colonoscopy done recentlyy. If the FOBT is positive， then a colonoscopy must be done regardless of how long it has been since the last one. However， the gastroenterologist should be consulted about this and will need， in most places， to arrange the colonoscopy. The patient also will need an endoscopy， as her symptoms are severe. Possible complications of GERD and ulcers will need to be ruled in or out by an endoscopy. For a patient whose symptoms are not severe， the endoscopy can usually wait while the patient is monitored under conservative treatment with medication and diet changes.\n\n【44】What is the most likely differential diagnosis and why?\n\n【45】Gastroesophageal reflux disease：\n\n【46】This diagnosis is supported by the patient's symptoms of retrosternal burning pain that occurs after meals and is exacerbated by certain foods and heavy meals. The sour taste， coughing， and regurgita tion are also relevant symptoms. The fact that Meredith has achieved some relief with Maalox and Tums helps the clinician to validate that the condition is probably related to reflux. A cardiac condi-tion or an ulcer is unlikely to result in relief from an antacid.\n\n【47】What is the plan of treatment?\n\n【48】The first line treatment for GERD includes antacids， H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors (PPI). Meredith has already tried antacids but they are only providing minimal relief. At this point， Meredith should be started on a PPI once each day (with possibility of increase to twice each day if once a day is insufficient to control symptoms) for 4-8 weeks to see if that helps her symptoms to resolve. If her symptoms continue or if she develops dysphagia， weight loss， anemia， or odynophagia， she should be sent for an upper endoscopy. If these findings are normal but the patient continues to have symptoms， then the manometry and pH monitoring might be explored(small number of patients). If the endoscopy reveals abnormal results， such as Barrett’s esophagus， the patient should be referred to a gastroenterologist.\n\n【49】Lifestyle modification (diet， weight loss， sitting up after meals and in bed at night) might be suf-ficient for patients with mild cases of GERD. Most people can come off of the PPI after 8-12 weeks or just change to an as needed basis. However， Meredith has some troublesome symptoms that are affecting her quality of life. These modifications should still be recommended，but she should use the PPI therapy for 8-12 weeks.

The first set of cardiac enzymes are negative， but another set is important to obtain to definitely rule out acute MI. The patient had a recent coronary angiography which did not show blockage； thus， the severe anemia likely is causing the chest pain and ECG findings， consistent with unstable angina. The unstable angina may be the result of decreased oxygen supply to the heart due to blood loss. Thus， replacing blood volume treats both problems. Importantly， restoration of oxygen delivery to the heart is critical to avoid myocardial necrosis. The hemoglobin level of 5.9 g/dL may not be reflective of the true severity of anemia. Acutely， because patients bleed whole blood， the ratio of red cells to plasma volume does not change. It is only after volume repletion and restoration of the intravascular volume that we may see the 删除换行1 true hemoglobin level. Meanwhile， another consideration is that transfusion that is too rapid may lead to volume overload， if the patient has any degree of heart failure. Thus， this patient is very complex and fragile， and should be monitored carefully in the critical care area.\n\n【22】APPROACH TO：Transfusion Medicine\n\n【23】DEFINITIONS\n\n【24】ACUTE HEMOLYTIC REACTION： Transfusion reaction due to antibody lysis of transfused red blood cells.\n\n【25】NON-ST-ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION： Clinical features of unstable angina， but with evidence of myocardial necrosis such as elevated cardiac biomarkers.\n\n【26】TRANSFUSION-RELATED ACUTE LUNG INJURY： Immune-mediated lung injury in reaction to any blood product. Characterized by acute respiratory distress occurring during or within 6 hours of the transfusion.\n\n【27】UNSTABLE ANGINA： Angina pectoris or equivalent ischemic discomfort occur-ring at rest， or severe and new onset， or in a crescendo pattern. Unstable angina， unlike NSTEMI or STEMI (ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction)， does not cause elevated levels of cardiac biomarkers or ST-segment elevation on ECG.\n\n【28】CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【29】Anemia\n\n【30】Anemia occurs when the hemoglobin level is less than 12 g/dL in women or less than13 g/dL in men. Symptoms attributable to anemia are manifold and depend pri-marily on the patient's underlying cardiopulmonary status and the chronicity with which the anemia developed. For a slowly developing， chronic anemia in patients with good cardiopulmonary reserve， symptoms may not present until hemoglobin levels are as low as 3 or 4 g/dL. Patients with serious underlying cardiopulmonary disease who depend on adequate oxygen-carrying capacity may become symptom-atic with smaller drops in hemoglobin.\n\n【31】Packed Red Blood Cells\n\n【32】Indications for transfusion of PRBCs are acute surgical or nonsurgical blood loss； anemia with end-organ effects (eg， syncope， angina pectoris) or hemodynamic com-promise； and critical illness to improve oxygen-carrying capacity or delivery to tis-sues. There are no absolute guidelines or thresholds for transfusion. Many believe that a hemoglobin level of 7 g/dL is adequate in the absence of a clearly defined increased need， such as cardiac ischemia， for which a hematocrit level of at least30% may be desired. In the absence of ongoing bleeding or destruction of red cells， we typically expect that each unit of PRBCs will result in an increase of 1 g/dL in 删除换行1 the hemoglobin level or 3% in the hematocrit level. In addition to PRBCs， there are other components of whole blood， including platelets， FFP， cryoprecipitate， and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg).\n\n【33】Platelets and Fresh Frozen Plasma\n\n【34】Thrombocytopenia can frequently be treated with platelet transfusion. When a patient has a platelet count of less than 50，000/mm’ and has significant bleed-ing， or when a patient is at risk for spontaneous bleeding with a level of less than10，000/mm， platelets can be transfused. Each unit increases the platelet count from 5000 to 10，000/mm. Transfusion is generally not helpful in cases of plate-let destruction， such as immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)， unless active， severe bleeding occurs. Platelet transfusion is contraindicated in patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)， as it may worsen microvascular thrombosis and cause worsening neurologic symptoms or renal failure.\n\n【35】Fresh Frozen Plasma. FFP replaces clotting factors and is often given to reverse warfarin (Coumadin) anticoagulation. Cryoprecipitate from FFP replaces fibrino-gen and some clotting factors， making it useful in patients with hemophilia A and von Willebrand disease.\n\n【36】Alternatives to Transfusions\n\n【37】Erythropoietin， a hormone that promotes red cell production， is often used in the treatment of renal failure-related anemia or in patients who are banking a presurgi-cal autologous transfusion to encourage quicker recovery of their hemoglobin levels prior to surgery. Cell savers salvage some intraoperative blood losses， which are then transfused back into the patient. Some patients may not wish to have foreign blood products transfused. In these cases， we can increase the baseline hemoglobin level by using erythropoietin and iron before planned surgery， minimize phlebot-omy for laboratory testing， and use cell savers during surgery.\n\n【38】Complications\n\n【39】Infection. Viruses that are screened for but can still be transmitted include hepatitis C virus (1 in 103，000 units)， human T-cell lymphocyte virus types I and II， HIV(1 in 700，000)， hepatitis B virus (1 in 66，000)， and parvovirus B19.Rarely， bacterial contamination (eg， Yersinia enterocolitica) causes fevers， sepsis， and even death dur-ing or soon after transfusion. Parasites (eg， malaria) are screened for by questioning a donor's medical and travel history.\n\n【40】Immune-Mediated Complications. With respect to immune mechanisms， it is possible that a recipient has preformed natural antibodies that lyse foreign donor erythrocytes， which can be associated with the major A and/or B or O blood types or with other antigens (eg， D， Duffy， Kidd). To avoid hemolysis， a “type and cross”is first performed， in which blood samples are tested for compatibility prior to transfusion.\n\n【41】An acute hemolytic transfusion reaction， which is caused by ABO incompatibil-ity due to clerical error， typically occurs within 1 hour of the transfusion being started. It may be associated with hypotension， fever， chills， hemoglobinuria， flank pain， disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)， and renal failure. This is a medi-cal emergency， so transfusion must be halted immediately， and fluids， specifically 删除换行1 normal saline， should be started urgently to prevent progression into renal failure. Lactated Ringer's solution and fluids with dextrose should be avoided； the calcium content in lactated Ringer’s may cause clotting of blood in the intravenous line， and dextrose can cause hemolysis of red blood cells in the intravenous line. Diuretics may be used in those with volume overload if the patient is not hypotensive； in severe cases， dialysis may be initiated to protect from kidney failure via immune-complex deposits. Laboratory tests for intravascular hemolysis should be checked(lactate dehydrogenase \\[LDH\\]， indirect bilirubin， haptoglobin)， as well as coagula-tion tests for DIC.\n\n【42】Delayed hemolytic reactions are less predictable and usually milder； these reac-tions involve amnestic responses from the recipient. They range from urticaria treated with diphenhydramine and transfusion interruption to anaphylaxis， in which case the transfusion must be stopped and epinephrine and steroids given. Febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions， thought to result from production of leukocyte cytokines during storage， can be treated by antipyretics and prevented by leukoreduction. Sometimes TRALI occurs， in which case the appearance of bilat-eral interstitial infiltrates in the lung represents noncardiogenic pulmonary edema.\n\n【43】Nonimmune Complications. Considering nonimmune consequences， the transfu-sion itself supplies 300 mL of fluid per unit of PRBCs intravascularly， so patients can easily become volume overloaded. Adjusting the volume and rate and using diuretics will prevent this complication. Each unit of blood also provides 250 mg of iron. Multiple and frequent transfusions can cause iron overload and deposition(hemosiderosis)， leading to cirrhosis， cardiac problems (eg， arrhythmia， heart fail-ure)， or diabetes.\n删除16：<u>CASE CORRELATION\n\n【44】●See also Case 3 (Acute Coronary Syndrome)， Case 54 (Iron-Deficiency Anemia)， Case 56 (Immune Thrombocytopenia Purpura/Abnormal Bleeding)， and Case 58 (Sickle Cell Crisis).\n</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

This approach is also advocated by Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) guidelines. Once the ABCs are stabilized， a thorough second-ary survey， consisting of a detailed physical examination， should follow. In this patient， the ABCs are stable and the secondary survey reveals abdominal pain and a likely right femur fracture with intact pulses. Immediately subsequent to the secondary survey， the ultrasound examination demonstrates free fluid in the hepatorenal potential space known as Morison pouch. Presence of fluid in the hepatorenal space indicates intra-abdominal hemorrhage likely secondary to solid organ injury. Since this patient is hemodynamically stable， a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis should be done to identify and grade the severity of the injuries. In addition to estimating the amount of intraperitoneal free fluid， the CT scan can aid in identifying the source of bleed-ing and the presence of other injuries that may have not been appreciated on clinical examination. The limitations of CT scans in blunt trauma—mainly the lower sensitivity for hollow organ injuries and bowel wall hematomas-should91be kept in mind when reviewing a CT scan in this setting.1\\.

Despite transiently elevated arterial pressures and cardiac out-put， the body is unable to recover， and death becomes inevitable.Hemorrhagic shock is the most common cause of death in trauma patients aside from traumatic brain injury. A high level of suspicion for hemorrhage and hemorrhagic shock should dominate evaluation of a trauma patient， especially as vital signs may not become abnormal until a significant amount of hemorrhage has occurred. Hem-orrhagic shock is classified by the advanced trauma life support (ATLS) into four categories to further emphasize the progression of vital sign instability in response to blood loss . Additional clinical signs that indicate hemorrhagic shock include skin pallor/coolness， delayed capillary refill， weak distal pulses， and anxiety.| Table 7-2。ATLS CLASSIFICATION OF HEMORRHAGE  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Class Of Hemorrhage  | ClassI  | ClassII  | Class III  | Class IV  |\n| Blood loss (mL)  | <750  | 750-1500  | 1500-2000  | \\>2000  |\n| Pulse (beats per minute)  | <100  | \\>100  | \\>120  | \\>140  |\n| Blood pressure  | Normal  | Normal  | Decreased  | Decreased  |\n| Pulse pressure {mm Hg)  | Normal  | Decreased  | Decreased  | Decreased  |\n| Respiratory rate (breathsper minute)  | 14-20  | 20-30  | 30-40  | \\>40  |\n| Urine output (mL/h)  | \\>30  | 20-30  | 5-15  | Negligible  |\n| Central nervous system{mental status\\]  | slightly anxious  | Mildly anxious  | Anxious， confused  | Lethargic  |A trauma patient should be carefully screened to locate the source of blood loss. In this patient， the possibility of bleeding should be assessed in five areas： 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> external bleeding (eg， scalp/extremity lacerations)； 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> thorax (eg， hemothorax， aortic injury)；通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> peritoneal cavity (eg， solid organ lacerations， large vessel injury)； 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> pelvis/retroperitoneum (eg， pelvic fracture)； and 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> soft-tissue compartments (eg， long-bone fractures). Adjunctive studies that should be obtained in blunt trauma patients early during their evaluation include chest and pelvic roentgenograms and computed tomography (CT) scans of the head， chest， abdomen， and pelvis. Chest roentgeno-grams can identify a hemothorax and potential mediastinal bleeding. Pelvic films can demonstrate pelvic fractures as a source of pelvic blood loss. Films of any affected extremity， in this case the femur， should also be obtained. Fractures are not only associ-ated with blood loss from the bone and adjacent soft tissue， but their presence indicates significant energy transfer (often referred to as a significant mechanism of injury) and should increase the clinical suspicion for intra-abdominal and retroperitoneal bleeding. Typically， tibial or humeral fractures can be associated with 750 mL of blood loss(1.5 units of blood)， whereas femur fractures can be associated with up to 1500 mL of blood (3 units of blood) in the thigh. Pelvic fractures may result in even more blood loss-up to several liters can be lost into a retroperitoneal hematoma.With the ongoing metabolic acidosis of hemorrhagic shock， an increased base deficit and lactate level will be seen. Both lactate and base deficit levels are labora-tory values that indicate systemic acidosis， not local tissue ischemia. They are global indices of tissue perfusion and normal values may mask areas of under perfusion as a consequence of normal blood flow to the remainder of the body. These laboratory tests are not true representations of tissue hypoxia. It is， therefore， not surprising that lactate and base deficit are poor prognostic indicators of survival in patients with shock. Although absolute values of these laboratory results are not predictors of survival in patients with shock， the baseline value and trends can be used to deter-mine the extent of tissue hypoxia and adequacy of resuscitation. Normalization of base deficit and serum lactate within 24 hours after resuscitation is a good prognostic indicator of survival. Of note， given that lactate is hepatically metabolized， it is not a reliable value in patients with liver dysfunction.Resuscitation The most common and easily available fluid replacements are isotonic crystalloid solutions such as normal saline or lactated Ringer solution. For each liter of these solutions that is infused， approximately 300 mL stays in the 删除换行1 intravascular space while the remainder leaks into the interstitial space. This distri-bution has led to the guideline of 3 mL crystalloid replacement for each 1 mL of blood loss. A blood transfusion is indicated if the patient persists in shock despite the rapid infusion of 2 to 3 L of crystalloid solution， or if the patient has had such se-vere blood loss that cardiovascular collapse is imminent. When possible， typed and cross-matched blood is optimal； however， in the acute setting， this is often unfea-sible. Type-specific unmatched blood is the next best option， followed by O-negative blood in females and O-positive blood in males. Blood is generally administered as packed erythrocytes or packed red blood cells (PRBCs). Crystalloids， fresh-frozen plasma (FFP)， and/or platelets may need to be transfused if massive blood volumes have been given. Transfusion protocols differ by institution regarding the ratio of FFP to platelets to PRBCs that should be administered. Colloid solutions such as albumin and hetastarch or dextran are not superior to crystalloid replacement in the acute setting and have the potential for large fluid shifts and pulmonary or bowel wall edema. Hypertonic solutions such as 7.5% saline have the advantage of retain-ing as much as 500 mL in the intravascular space and may be useful in trauma situa-tions with no access to blood products， such as in military settings.\n\n【10】The concept of permissive hypotension is now more widely accepted in trauma care. The central tenet is that patients suffering from hemorrhagic shock (exclud-ing intracranial hemorrhages) may benefit from judicious fluid administration. In permissive hypotension， the patient’s blood pressure is not resuscitated to their normal blood pressure， or to what physicians consider a normal blood pressure. Instead， the blood pressure is allowed to remain low (mean arterial pressures of60-70 mm Hg or a systolic blood pressure of 80-90 mm Hg). Permissive hypo-tension is thought to be effective in hemorrhagic shock because it is thought that post-hemorrhage， the artificially increased blood pressure by aggressive fluid resuscitation may disrupt endogenous clot formation and promote further bleed-ing. Also， crystalloid is often administered at room temperature， which is actually colder than the body temperature and can result in hypothermia following exces-sive administration. Crystalloid can also dilute the endogenous clotting factors and erythrocyte concentration， resulting in poorer control of bleeding and also diminished oxygen carrying capacity. Though shown to have great benefits in ani-mal models， human studies of permissive hypotension are few. However， this con-cept is becoming more accepted in trauma centers. Patients in whom permissive hypotension should not be practiced are： patients with traumatic brain injuries who require maintenance of their cerebral perfusion pressure； patients with a his-tory of hypertension， congestive heart failure， or coronary artery disease， in whom hypotension will be poorly tolerated and may produce other medical problems such as strokes or myocardial infarctions.While contacting and arranging for further definitive care， appropriate resuscitation of the patient should be initiated.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Daniel’s father had moved away from the Gold Coast 8 years earlier, after he and Daniel’s mother separated. Daniel stayed with his father mostly during the school holidays and some weekends. Daniel described his family relationships as close and explained that his parents had always been very supportive of him. Daniel attended a private school and performed well academically. He particularly enjoyed physical education and hoped to be a physical education teacher after leaving school. Daniel had a close group of school friends, but described himself as one of the quieter ones in the group.\n\n【3】### History\n\n【4】Daniel first experienced OCD-like symptoms when he was in primary school at 9 years of age. He would ask his mother to repeat saying certain things, like “have a good day” and “love you”, when she dropped him off at school. He also remembered having to get into bed at night a certain way to avoid bad things from happening and retracing his steps until he felt just right. These behaviours caused him only minimal distress and did not impact significantly on his daily life.\n\n【5】According to his mother, Daniel suffered from separation anxiety at 5 years of age when he first started school; however, this resolved within the first 12 months of his schooling. When Daniel was 8 years old, his parents separated, and although Daniel was upset, he generally coped well with the situation.\n\n【6】The onset of his current OCD symptoms was at 15 years of age (one year prior to presenting). The onset coincided with the tragic accident of his sister’s best friend who was involved in a car accident where she was killed and her father severely injured. Daniel’s mother recalled that Daniel would ask for reassurance that she would drive safely following this incident. Daniel’s symptoms had progressively worsened over the year before seeking treatment. He identified his senior school exams and the pressure to get his licence as ongoing stressors that exacerbated his symptoms. In the few months prior to starting treatment, Daniel noticed a dramatic increase in symptoms triggered by him and his friends starting to organize their “Schoolies Week” accommodation in the Surfers Paradise on the Gold Coast.\n\n【7】Daniel’s mother reported that she also suffers from significant anxiety. She worries about the future, performing at work, her children, and her health, and she indicated that she finds it difficult to control these worries. She expressed concern that her worries about her family may have led her to be overprotective of her children.\n\n【8】### Treatment History\n\n【9】Daniel had never received treatment for OCD and was first diagnosed at our initial assessment at 16 years of age. He was very reluctant to consider taking medication for OCD due to concerns that it might cause him to commit suicide by overdosing. He had never received any psychological or medical treatment previously for any mental health problem.\n\n【10】Case Conceptualization and Assessment\n-------------------------------------\n\n【11】### Conceptualization\n\n【12】Daniel may have had a biological vulnerability to developing OCD given that his mother has a history of persistent anxiety. Furthermore, Daniel appeared to have an anxious temperament; as a young child he experienced separation anxiety and engaged in ritualized behaviours when feeling anxious about separating from his mother and at bedtime. In combination with a biological vulnerability, stressful life events such as the separation of his parents may have predisposed Daniel to developing psychopathology. Despite some subclinical OC symptoms during middle childhood, Daniel appeared to have had an abrupt onset of clinical OCD following the death of his sister’s friend. His symptoms were exacerbated by the stressors of finishing his schooling, planning for his upcoming “Schoolies Week” and, not surprisingly, his experience of learning to drive was a salient trigger for his current episode.\n\n【13】Daniel held numerous dysfunctional beliefs in regard to the experience of intrusions as well as in relation to the content of his intrusions. Given the relentless nature of obsessions, coupled with poor inhibitory control associated with OCD, it is proposed that appraisals about the occurrence and meaning of intrusions develop and serve to perpetuate the experience of these intrusions, such that they become obsessional in nature and therefore are associated with escalating distress, and attempts to neutralize through overt and covert avoidance, and ritualizing.\n\n【14】It was hypothesized that Daniel’s fear associated with his obsessions resulted from his dysfunctional beliefs regarding the presence and significance of his aggressive thoughts, and following this, his efforts to control these thoughts. Daniel believed that he was responsible for his own and his mother’s safety (i.e. inflated responsibility bias). Moreover, he believed that simply thinking about harming himself (e.g. cutting his wrist, jumping off the balcony) would increase the probability that he would indeed harm himself (i.e. thought–action fusion beliefs). Because of this, Daniel tried to suppress his aggressive obsessions (i.e. control of thoughts), exerting mental control and ineffective suppression techniques, which in turn served to maintain these dysfunctional beliefs about harm and responsibility for preventing harm, which led to Daniel experiencing his intrusive thoughts more often and with heightened anxiety and intensity.\n\n【15】Daniel avoided external fear triggers (e.g. surfing, driving, patting his bird) to prevent himself from having to experience his aggressive thoughts and the related distress they caused. Moreover, Daniel engaged in rituals, such as repeating neutral thoughts, checking locks, checking that he had not been involved in a car accident, and seeking reassurance from his parents, to decrease the anxiety associated with these situations and the experience of intrusions. In the short term, Daniel’s distress was reduced when he could avoid his triggers or engage in rituals. However, these strategies prevented him from acquiring corrective evidence that he could indeed tolerate uncertainty and discovering that his obsessions, although unpleasant, were inaccurate. Hence, Daniel’s avoidance and ritualizing served to maintain his fear of these disturbing intrusive thoughts. Furthermore, the anxiety associated with these thoughts was continuing to worsen given the significant attention and preoccupation Daniel had with trying to “not” think about them.\n\n【16】Despite the vicious cycle of obsessions and fear that Daniel was caught up in, he had numerous protective factors present in his life, including a supportive mother and sister and a close group of friends. He was also achieving well at school and is of at least average intelligence.\n\n【17】### Assessment\n\n【18】Diagnostic Interviews\n\n【19】Daniel was administered the Children’s Yale–Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale 删除10：<u>(CYBOCS; Scahill et al. 1997 )</u>, and his score 通用删除7(英):<u>(30)</u> fell within the severe range of OCD symptomology . He scored a 17 on the obsessions subscale and 13 on the compulsions subscale. Additionally, Daniel and his mother were interviewed using the Anxiety Disorder Interview Schedule for Children 删除10：<u>(ADIS-IV-C/P; Silverman and Albano 1996 )</u>. Based on Daniel’s report and that of his mother’s during the diagnostic interviews, Daniel was diagnosed with a primary diagnosis of OCD, with a clinician severity rating (CSR) of 7 (on a scale of 0–8) and major depressive disorder (MDD) with a CSR of 4 删除33：<u>(on a scale of 0–8)</u>.\n\n【20】删除3：<u>Fig. 11.1\n\n【21】A cognitive-behavioural formulation of Daniel’s OCD. OC obsessive compulsive</u>\n\n【22】Behavioural Approach Task (BAT)\n\n【23】BATs are standardized and controlled tasks designed to assess how someone responds when exposed to feared stimulus. In particular, when avoidance is pathological, a BAT provides a valid assessment of both fear and avoidance behaviours in a standardized and systematic way. Moreover, once exposed to the stimuli that elicit fear and avoidance, a child is more accurately able to gauge their degree of distress, along with any dysfunctional beliefs that they may experience in the context of arousal. A BAT task for OCD can be set up as a series of steps to measure approach/avoidance or an ERP task whereby the child is instructed to withhold ritualizing for a period of time (usually 5 min only) to measure resistance and control, as well as fear and fear-related beliefs. The child is instructed that they can stop the BAT at any time, and that following the BAT they are free to engage in rituals to alleviate any distress.\n\n【24】A number of potential BATs were considered for Daniel. For example: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> taking Kai (Daniel’s pet bird) out of his cage and holding him with two hands around his body for 5 min; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> holding a knife against his wrist for a period of 5 min; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> leaning over a three-storey balcony, dangling his arms over the edge. Given that during the diagnostic interview Daniel indicated that jumping off a balcony at “Schoolies Week” was his most worrying OCD symptom at the time, it was determined that he complete a BAT related to this. During the BAT conducted on the university campus, Daniel was asked to enter a room (by himself), walk towards a balcony door, open the door, walk over to the railing of the seventh floor balcony, dangle his arms, and lean over the side of the balcony for 5 min. Prior to commencing the BAT, Daniel’s obsessional beliefs and fear level were assessed. Daniel reported that he was afraid that if he leant over the balcony, he would experience a strong urge to climb over the balcony railing and end his life. Belief ratings were assessed before and after the BAT, using a 9-point Likert scale to measure intensity (i.e. 0 = not at all, to 10 = extreme ). Following these pre-BAT ratings, Daniel was asked to enter the room and try his best to compete as many steps as possible, without seeking reassurance. Daniel was able to enter the room and approach the balcony door; however, he was not able to open the door. He rated his subjective anxiety at an 8 (on a scale ranging from 0 to 10). He then rated his belief that he would have the urge to jump ( truth rating = 8), the chance his belief would actually occur ( probability \\= 9), how bad it would be for him if he did actually have the urge to jump off the balcony ( severity \\= 9), and how sure he was that he could cope if he did have the urge to jump off the balcony (estimation of coping \\= 2).\n\n【25】Self-Report Questionnaires\n\n【26】In addition to diagnostic interviews and a behavioural approach task, Daniel completed a number of self-report measures. To assess for comorbid anxiety symptomology , the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children 删除10：<u>(MASC; March 1997 )</u> was used, and to assess for comorbid depressive symptoms, the Children’s Depression Inventory 删除10：<u>(CDI; Kovacs 1992 )</u> was used. Daniel’s scores on both the MASC (total score = 84) and the CDI (total score = 82) were very elevated. To assess for OC-related dysfunctional beliefs, the Obsessive Beliefs Questionnaire—Child Version 删除10：<u>(OBQ-CV; Coles et al. 2010 )</u> was also given as part of a comprehensive assessment. This is a 44-item self-report scale that measures belief domains linked to OCD, including responsibility/threat estimation, perfectionism/certainty, and importance/control of thoughts. Daniel’s score on the OBQ-CV was above clinical norms (total score = 132).\n\n【27】Risk Assessment\n\n【28】Given that Daniel presented with thoughts of harming himself and others, a brief risk assessment was conducted with Daniel. As previously discussed, a large proportion of people who suffer from OCD report having intrusive violent, sexual, and death-related thoughts. It is essential for clinicians to have a sound knowledge of OCD phenomenology in order to be able to differentiate between thoughts and urges in people with OCD, in comparison to the thoughts experienced by those who may be sexual or violent offenders or people who are actively suicidal 删除10：<u>(Veale et al. 2009 )</u>. If a child or adult is presenting with OCD, there is almost a negligible risk that they will carry out their obsession. Obsessions by definition are intrusive and unwanted thoughts, which are ego dystonic to the person. Moreover, an obsession represents a fear that the person wishes to avoid at all costs 删除10：<u>(Veale et al. 2009 )</u>. To further assist in differential diagnosis when assessing someone who has aggressive thoughts the following factors should be considered (adapted from Veale et al. 通用删除7(英):<u>( 2009 )</u>): 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Are the thoughts ego dystonic? 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> Does the person avoid situations that trigger the thoughts? 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> Does the person attempt to suppress or neutralize the thoughts? 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> What is the dominant emotion the person experiences when they have the thoughts (e.g. anxiety, distress, or guilt vs pleasure)? 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> Does the person have other symptoms of OCD? 通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u> What other comorbid diagnoses does the person have? 通用删除7(英):<u>(7)</u> What is the person’s motivation for seeking help? and 通用删除7(英):<u>(8)</u> Does the person have a history of harming themselves or others? Whilst minimizing the “actual risk” of a patient acting on an obsessional thought, one must always be diligent of the possible secondary risk of suicidal ideation, that might arise as a result of (a) the sufferer choosing to hurt themselves rather than endure the obsessional belief that they might hurt someone else or (b) the sufferers experience of hopelessness and despair associated with severe comorbid depression.\n\n【29】Daniel reported feeling extremely distressed by thoughts of harming himself and others and went to great lengths to avoid situations which triggered his intrusive thoughts (e.g. stopping surfing, fishing, not driving, and no longer caring for or spending time with the family pet). Moreover, Daniel engaged in mental rituals in an attempt to neutralize his thoughts. Daniel also reported other OCD symptoms including feeling “just not right” when waxing his surfboard and checking related to health and illness concerns. Daniel presented with comorbid depression. Daniel’s risk of suicide was further assessed. He reported having a low mood most of the day, anhedonia, and lacking energy—symptoms that developed after his OCD worsened and during his current episode. Again he reported that he did not wish to end his life. He indicated that he felt his mood would improve if he no longer had OCD symptoms. Daniel has no history of depression, suicide attempts, or harming others.\n\n【30】Treatment\n---------\n\n【31】Daniel attended the Griffith University OCD clinic for 14 × 1 hour weekly sessions of CBT 删除25：<u></u>.\nTable 11.2 删除换行 Overview of Daniel’s treatment\n\n| Session number | Session content |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1–2 | Psychoeducation |\n| 1–2 | Nature and symptoms of OCD |\n| 1–2 | Cycle of OCD |\n| 1–2 | Treatments for OCD including CBT |\n| 1–2 | Fear thermometer and monitoring OCD |\n| 1–2 | Role of family accommodation in the maintenance of OCD |\n| 3 | Introduction to ERP |\n| 3 | Rationale for treatment—ERP |\n| 3 | ERP hierarchy development |\n| 3 | Practice of ERP in session and at home |\n| 4–12 | ERP and cognitive therapy |\n| 4–12 | In session ERP practice: harm to self and others |\n| 4–12 | In session exposure to obsessional thoughts |\n| 4–12 | Thinking traps of OCD—thought–action fusion—morality |\n| 4–12 | Thinking traps of OCD—thought–action fusion—likelihood |\n| 4–12 | Thinking traps of OCD—inflated probability of danger |\n| 4–12 | Thinking traps of OCD—inflated sense of responsibility |\n| 4–12 | Thinking traps of OCD—control of thoughts |\n| 4–12 | Home practice—ERP to aggressive beliefs and stimuli being avoided |\n| 13–14 | Relapse prevention and planning for life without OCD |\n\n【33】OCD obsessive-compulsive disorder, CBT cognitive behavioural therapy, ERP exposure and response prevention\n\n【34】### Treatment Modules\n\n【35】#### Psychoeducation\n\n【36】Daniel’s treatment commenced with psychoeducation .

Know the definition of primary amenorrhea， that is， no menses by the age of16 years.\n\n【15】2\\. Know that the two most common causes of primary amenorrhea when there is normal breast development are millerian agenesis and androgen insensitivity.\n\n【16】3\\. Understand that a serum testosterone level or karyotype would differentiate the two conditions.\n\n【17】Considerations\n\n【18】This 18-year-old adolescent woman has never had a menstrual period； therefore， she has primary amenorrhea. She has normal Tanner stage IV breast development as well as normal axillary and pubic hair. Breast development connotes the pres-ence of estrogen， and axillary and pubic hair suggests the presence of androgens. She also has a history of only one kidney. The most likely diagnosis is mullerian agenesis because a significant fraction of such patients will have a urinary tract abnormality. Also， with androgen insensitivity， there is typically scant axillary and pubic hair since there is a defective androgen receptor. The diagnosis can be con-firmed with a serum testosterone， which would be normal in miillerian agenesis， and elevated (in the normal male range) in androgen insensitivity. In both condi-tions， there is no uterus， tubes， or cervix， and a blind vaginal pouch or vaginal dimple. A karyotype would also help to distinguish the two conditions. Notably， absence of breast development would point to a hypoestrogenic state such as gonadal dys-genesis (Turner syndrome).\n\n【19】APPROACHTO：Primary Amenorrhea\n\n【20】DEFINITIONS\n\n【21】PRIMARY AMENORRHEA：No menarche by the age of 16 years.\n\n【22】ANDROGEN INSENSITIVITY： An androgen receptor defect in which 46，XY individuals are phenotypically female with normal breast development.\n\n【23】MULLERIAN AGENESIS： Congenital absence of development of the uterus， cer-vix， and fallopian tubes in a 46，XX female， leading to primary amenorrhea.\n\n【24】CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【25】When a young woman presents with primary amenorrhea， the differential diagno-sis can be narrowed on the basis of whether or not normal breast tissue is present， and whether a uterus is present or absent. After pregnancy is excluded， the two most common etiologies that cause primary amenorrhea associated with normal breast development and an absent uterus are androgen insensitivity syndrome and miillerian agenesis .\n\n【26】An individual with androgen insensitivity syndrome， also known as testicular feminization， has a 46，XY karyotype with normally functioning male gonads that produce normal male levels of testosterone. H owever， due to a defect in the andro-gen receptor synthesis or action， there is no formation of male internal or external genitalia. The external genitalia remain female， as it occurs in the absence of sex steroids. There are no internal female reproductive organs， and the vagina is short or absent. Without androgenic opposition to the small circulating levels of estro-gen secreted by the gonads and adrenals， and produced by peripheral conversion of androstenedione， breast development is normal or enhanced. Pubic and axillary hair is absent or scant due to defective androgen receptors. Therefore， these individu-als are genotypically male (46，XY karyotype) but phenotypically female (look like a woman). The abnormal intra-abdominal gonads are at increased risk for malig-nancy， but this rarely occurs before puberty. Thus， gonadectomy is not performed until after puberty is completed to allow full breast development and linear growth\n\n| Table 55-1·MULLERIAN AGENESIS VERSUS ANDROGEN INSENSITIVITY  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Mullerian Agenesis  | Androgen Insensitivity  |\n| Breast tissue  | Normal breast development  | Normal breast development  |\n| Axillary and pubic hair  | Normal  | Scant or absent  |\n| Uterus and vagina  | Absent uterus and blind vag ina  | Absent uterus and blind vagina  |\n| Testosterone level  | Normaltestosterone  | High testosterone (male range)  |\n| Karyotype  | 46，XX  | 46，XY  |\n| Complications  | Renalanomalies  | Need gonadectomy  |\n\n【28】to occur. After these events take place， usually around the age of 16 to 18 years， the gonads should be removed. The diagnosis of androgen insensitivity syndrome should be suspected when a patient has primary amenorrhea， an absent uterus， nor-mal breast development， and scant or absent pubic and axillary hair. The diagnosis can be confirmed with a karyotype evaluation and/ or elevated testosterone levels(male normal range).\n\n【29】Women with miillerian agenesis have a 46，XX karyotype， no uterus or fal-lopian tubes， and a short or absent vagina. Externally， they resemble individuals with androgen insensitivity. They do， however， have normal functioning ovaries since the ovaries are not miillerian structures， and have normal breast develop-ment. They also have normal pubic and axillary hair growth because there is no defect in their androgen receptors. Congenital renal abnormalities occur in about one-third of these individuals. These women are genotypically and phenotypically female (46，XX). The diagnosis of mullerian agenesis should be suspected when a patient has primary amenorrhea， an absent uterus， normal breast development， and normal pubic and axillary hair. The presence of normal pubic and axillary hair is what differentiates them from individuals with androgen insensitivity syndrome， and laboratory confirmation can be accomplished with a karyotype examination and/or testosterone level.\n\n【30】Another type of miillerian defect is a uterine septum. In these cases， there is a midline septum that is of varying lengths due to incomplete dissolution of the fused midline portion of the miillerian ducts. Patients often have recurrent miscarriage due to the avascular nature of the septum and inability to sustain a pregnancy. Diagnosis is performed by hysterosalpingogram， saline infusion sonohysterogra-phy， or magnetic resonance imaging. Hysteroscopic resection of the septum is the treatment， and outcomes are very good.\n删除16：<u>CASE CORRELATION\n删除25：<u>See also Case 54 (Delayed Puberty) to distinguish between that condition(no breast development by age 14) and miillerian agenesis (primary amenor-rhea) where affected women have normal breast development but no menses by age 16.</u>\n</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Even though the definition of the compulsions requires that they are aimed at preventing or reducing anxiety/distress or preventing a dreaded outcome, young children may be unaware of or unable to articulate this function of their compulsions 删除10：<u>(APA 2013 )</u>. Approximately 80 % of OCD cases have a pediatric onset 删除10：<u>(Riddle 1998 )</u> with point-prevalence rates for pediatric OCD ranging from 1 to 42 % 删除10：<u>(Zohar et al. 1997 )</u>. Pediatric OCD is more common in males than females and likely to be comorbid with tics and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder 删除10：<u>(ADHD; Kalra and Swedo 2009 )</u>.\n\n【10】The content of the obsessions and compulsions varies considerably among patients with OCD with factor-analytic studies suggesting the presence of up to five separate obsessive-compulsive dimensions 删除10：<u>(Leckman et al. 1997 ; Mataix-Cols et al. 2005 ; Stewart et al. 2007 )</u>. This chapter focuses on the symmetry dimension of OCD, keeping in mind that the symptoms of pediatric OCD are heterogeneous 删除10：<u>(Mataix-Cols et al. 2005 ; Rettew et al. 1992 )</u>, and individuals may present with symptoms consistent with more than one dimension. Children displaying symptoms within the symmetry dimension often have obsessions about things being symmetrical, perfect, or “right.” As a result of this need for symmetry, children may repeat tasks until they are perfect or “just right,” perform acts in a symmetrical manner as to “even out,” engage in compulsions of putting things in a certain order, or engage in counting compulsions. Individuals with symmetry OCD also have a higher rate of the compulsive need to touch, tap, or rub, and “fear of not saying just the right thing” 删除10：<u>(Leckman et al. 1997 , p. 914)</u>. These compulsions are oftentimes time-consuming and may lead to considerable impairment, such as being late due to lengthy morning routines involving matching, evening out, and/or repetitive actions. Symmetry OCD is more common in males than females and is more commonly comorbid with tic disorders than other OCD dimensions 删除10：<u>(Leckman et al. 1997 ; Mataix-Cols et al. 2005 ; Storch et al. 2008c )</u>, with younger children exhibiting greater “just not right” and other symmetry compulsions (e.g. touching, tapping, repeating) than older cohorts 删除10：<u>(Garcia et al. 2009 )</u>.\n\n【11】Evidence-Based Treatments for Pediatric OCD\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【12】Pediatric OCD can be quite debilitating for the child as well as the family; therefore, it is important for children with OCD to receive effective treatment for their symptoms. The gold standard treatment for OCD in both adults and children is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) with exposure and response prevention (ERP) either alone or in combination with pharmacotherapy 删除10：<u>(AACAP 2012 ; Lewin and Piacentini 2009 )</u>. The Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry 删除10：<u>(AACAP; 2012 )</u> practice parameters recommend using a combination of pharmacotherapy and CBT for older children and adolescents and with individuals who experience moderate-to-severe OCD, while CBT alone is recommended to be more appropriate for use with younger children and with iOCD of mild-to-moderate severity 删除10：<u>(AACAP 2012 )</u>. Further, combined treatment (pharmacotherapy inclusive) may not always be considered an acceptable approach for parents 删除10：<u>(Stevens et al. 2009 )</u>, with parents demonstrating preference for CBT over pharmacotherapy 删除10：<u>(Lewin et al. 2014 )</u>.\n\n【13】ERP, the primary component of exposure-based CBT for OCD, aims at identifying the child’s triggers for obsessions and compulsions and creating a hierarchy of feared situations that can be practiced in and outside of therapy sessions 删除10：<u>(March and Mulle 1998 )</u>. As part of ERP, the child is exposed to the triggering stimuli or situations but is prevented from carrying out the compulsions, with repeated exposures leading to habituation to associated anxiety and discomfort 删除10：<u>(Bouton 2004 ; Jordan et al. 2012 )</u>. Exposure-based CBT has been shown to be superior to placebo 删除10：<u>(POTS 2004 )</u>, attention-control conditions 删除10：<u>(Freeman et al. 2008 ; Piacentini et al. 2011 )</u>, and in some studies, antidepressant medications 删除10：<u>(POTS 2004 ; POTS-II 2011 ; Storch et al. 2013 )</u>.\n\n【14】Factors for Consideration with Treatment of Younger Children\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】Factors such as family functioning and accommodation 删除10：<u>(Storch et al. 2007a ; Rapee 2012 )</u>, lack of insight and motivation 删除10：<u>(Lewin et al. 2010 ; Selles et al. 2014 ; Storch et al. 2008b )</u>, and associated behavior problems (e.g. anxious oppositional or tantrum behaviors) may also play a significant role in prognosis and treatment response; therefore, as part of ERP-based treatment, these factors must be addressed appropriately. In youth, and especially younger youth, sessions oftentimes are delivered in a family-based format 删除10：<u>(e.g. Barrett et al. 2004 ; Lewin et al. 2014 )</u> to facilitate understanding of treatment principles, recruit the parent as a “coach” outside of sessions, decrease family accommodation 删除10：<u>(i.e. any behavior on behalf of family members that is aimed at decreasing the child’s OCD-related distress, but inadvertently leading to reinforcement of the OCD symptoms; Storch et al. 2007b ; Lewin et al. 2014 )</u>, and help increase the child’s efforts during exposures 删除10：<u>(Lebowitz et al. 2013 ; Rudy et al. 2014 ; Lewin et al. 2014 )</u>. Cognitive components of CBT (e.g. challenging cognitive distortions) may be less appropriate for younger populations due to developmentally appropriate lack of insight and metacognitive abilities, or “thinking about thinking,” 删除10：<u>(Freeman et al. 2008 ; Lewin et al. 2014 ; Kuhn 2000 ; Wellman et al. 2001 )</u>; therefore, a greater emphasis is made on behavioral strategies such as participant modeling, reinforced practice, and contingency management in combination with ERP 删除10：<u>(Lewin et al. 2014 ; May et al. 2013 ; Rudy et al. 2014 )</u>. Provision of external motivation through participant modeling 删除10：<u>(i.e. the child observes another individual interacting with a feared situation or stimulus in a non-fearful way; Bouton 2004 )</u> and reinforced practice 删除10：<u>(i.e. the provision of reinforcement of small gains for participating in exposure activities; Davis and Ollendick 2005 )</u> can be especially helpful 删除10：<u>(Hirshfeld-Becker and Biederman 2002 ; Hirshfeld-Becker et al. 2010 )</u>. Behavior management strategies such as time-out or response cost are also useful for addressing disruptive behaviors that often accompany anxious symptoms 删除10：<u>(i.e. anxious oppositionality; Hirshfeld-Becker and Biederman 2002 ; Hirshfeld-Becker et al. 2010 ; Rudy et al. 2014 )</u>. Thus, with these considerations in mind, the purpose of this chapter is to elucidate how to treat commonly occurring symmetry OCD in a child, aged 7 years, using exposure-based CBT with a heavy emphasis on behavioral strategies and family involvement.\n\n【16】Presenting Problem\n------------------\n\n【17】The following is a case example of a 7-year-old boy, Sam (a pseudonym), with symmetry OCD. Sam’s presenting symptoms were predominately compulsive in nature and included needing to “match” almost every purposeful action with a paired action. He engaged in a large amount of morning, bedtime, and separation (i.e. saying goodbye when separating from significant others in certain ways) rituals which involved his parents and grandparents. As part of these rituals, Sam required his parents to reproduce his actions or motions; for example, repeating words, waving in the same way, or touching objects the same way. The rituals would need to restart, should his parents or he not perform an exact replication of the action/motion. Sam also engaged in other, similar “matching” actions throughout the day. Sam touched or wiped objects (e.g. furniture before sitting, doors before opening) with his right and then his left hand in the same fashion and the same number of times. He counted steps so that his right and left foot took the same amount of steps. He needed to enter and then reenter rooms or use different doors (e.g. car doors, house doors) to even out his actions. Should any of Sam’s rituals, matching, or counting actions be done in a way other than the way he deemed “just right,” he would need to restart the ritual process. According to his parents, morning and separation (e.g. goodbye at preschool) rituals as well as bedtime rituals could last up to 2 + h each day, especially for days that were deemed “bad.” Sam’s parents described a myriad of “matching” behaviors that occurred without warning every day and were cumbersome and time-consuming for Sam and his family. Further, should his parents attempt to stop his ritual or “matching action” or refuse to participate, Sam reportedly engaged in excessive tantrum behaviors (e.g. yelling, crying, hitting, kicking) that lasted up to an hour or more. Given the high level of family involvement and time-consuming nature of the rituals, as well as the disruptive behaviors that occurred in the absence of the rituals, Sam’s compulsions were highly interfering with his own and his family functioning.\n\n【18】Case Information\n----------------\n\n【19】### Background and Psychological History\n\n【20】At the time of the intake session, Sam was a 7-year-old Caucasian/Latino male who was referred by his parents to a university-based anxiety specialty clinic due to significant anxiety and ritualistic behaviors. Sam lived in a suburban community with his biological parents and younger brother. He attended preschool 3 days per week and was cared for by his grandmother in the afternoons and on days that he did not attend school. No developmental delay or deficits in intellectual, language, or adaptive functioning were noted. All milestones were met on time.\n\n【21】Sam’s parents indicated that Sam’s ritualistic behaviors began between ages 3 and 4 years and had increased in severity since that time. Sam’s early rituals and compulsive behaviors included a strict bedtime routine and schedule-dependent sleep, tapping and touching “just right,” texture sensitivities with clothing, and counting and goodbye rituals (e.g. blowing four kisses for each goodbye). His rituals reportedly progressed in number and severity with increasing age. Sam’s parents reported that Sam had previously received a diagnosis of OCD by his pediatrician and had been seen by a licensed professional counselor (LPC) for play therapy for approximately five sessions without benefit. His parents reported that they were not involved in his therapy sessions and did not know the content of the sessions.

She has booked late having only just discovered she is pregnant.\nShe separated from her partner of 2 years a few weeks ago but is supported by her family and  删除换行1 friends. She has no significant medical history and is one of four siblings. On direct questioning her mother apparently had a stillbirth attributed to some form of congenital abnormality  删除换行1 28 years ago. Otherwise the pregnancy is assessed to be low risk.\n\n【3】She is offered a screening test for Down’s syndrome, which she agrees to. This is performed  删除换行1 at 12 weeks 2 days’ gestation.\n\n【4】INVESTIGATIONS\n\n【5】Combined test for Down’s syndrome:\n\n【6】• Pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A): 0.4 multiples of the mean (MoM)\n\n【7】• Free beta human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG): 1.7 multiples of the mean (MoM)\n\n【8】• Nuchal translucency: 2.9 mm\n\n【9】Overall Down’s syndrome risk calculated as 1 in 118\n\n【10】Questions\n\n【11】• What tests are available for screening for Down’s syndrome and how accurate are they?\n\n【12】• How would you counsel this woman about her options now?\n\n【13】ANSWER 54\n\n【14】Screening for Down’s syndrome\n\n【15】PAPP-A, free beta hCG and nuchal translucency (by ultrasound) are used in combination in  删除换行1 the ‘combined’ test, one of the screening tests available to detect Down’s syndrome. Down’s  删除换行1 syndrome is associated with a decreased level of PAPP-A and increased level of NT and free  删除换行1 beta hCG.\n\n【16】Serum marker levels are however affected by other variables. For example PAPP-A is decreased  删除换行1 in heavier women, about 60 per cent higher in Afro-Caribbean and about 20 per cent lower in  删除换行1 women who smoke, though these factors are taken account of in the risk assessment.\n\n【17】Other screening tests include the ‘triple test’, ‘quadruple test’ and ‘integrated test’. All such  删除换行1 tests aim for a detection rate of at least 90 per cent of affected fetuses and a screen positive rate  删除换行1 of less than 2 per cent of the unaffected fetuses.\n\n【18】The assessment of ‘high’ or ‘low’ risk is dependent on the viewpoint of the individual, but risk  删除换行1 higher than 1 in 150–250 is generally considered ‘high risk’. Such women should be offered  删除换行1 a diagnostic test.\n\n【19】Counselling\n\n【20】The woman should be counselled through the following options.\n\n【21】Expectant management\n\n【22】• The woman may choose not to have any further testing and accept the chance of a  删除换行1 baby with Down’s syndrome.\n\n【23】• Detailed ultrasound scan: at 20 weeks, features of Down’s syndrome (skull abnormalities, ventriculomegaly, atrial septal defect, duodenal atresia, echogenic bowel,  删除换行1 hydronephrosis and short limbs) may be apparent on detailed anomaly scan. If none  删除换行1 of these ‘soft markers’ are found then the woman might choose still to avoid further  删除换行1 diagnostic tests.\n\n【24】Diagnostic tests\n\n【25】• Chorionic villous sampling (CVS):\n\n【26】• performed 11 to 14 weeks’ gestation\n\n【27】• ultrasound guidance\n\n【28】• sample of placental tissue collected generally using needle inserted through the  删除换行1 abdominal wall\n\n【29】• small risk of miscarriage (about 1 per cent) associated with the procedure\n\n【30】• inconclusive result in 1 per cent of cases (so amniocentesis then required).\n\n【31】• Amniocentesis:\n\n【32】• performed any time from 15 to 16 weeks’ gestation\n\n【33】• ultrasound guidance\n\n【34】• sample of amniotic fluid collected using needle inserted through the abdominal wall\n\n【35】• small risk of miscarriage (about 1 per cent).\n\n【36】• Cell-free fetal DNA: This recently developed non-invasive diagnostic test detects  删除换行1 cell-free fetal DNA in a sample of maternal blood from 10 weeks’ gestation. It is used  删除换行1 to identify the common trisomies 通用删除7(英):<u>(21, 18, 13)</u> and fetal gender.Case 54: Antenatal screening\n\n【37】Women’s decisions depend on many factors. Some will want to know the diagnosis in order  删除换行1 to consider termination of pregnancy, whereas other couples may not opt for termination but  删除换行1 wish to be prepared for a baby with Down’s syndrome (and any medical needs it may have,  删除换行1 such as cardiac abnormalities) without the ongoing uncertainty throughout the duration of  删除换行1 the pregnancy. Time for discussion and sensitivity to the woman’s own situation are imperative in counselling.\n\n【38】KEY POINTS\n\n【39】• The possibility of screening for Down’s syndrome should be considered with all  删除换行1 women regardless of age.\n\n【40】• Women who choose not to undergo screening or diagnostic tests should have this  删除换行1 choice respected.\n\n【41】• Screening tests produce a risk for an individual pregnancy being affected by a  删除换行1 chromosomal abnormality, following which a woman may choose to undergo a  删除换行1 diagnostic test.\n• Diagnostic tests are chorionic villus sampling, amniocentesis and testing for cellfree fetal DNA in maternal blood.Case 55: Epilepsy in pregnancy", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

On examination， there is fissuring and ulceration of the areola and nipple. Biopsy of the breast skin shows large periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive cells with pale-staining cytoplasm within the epidermis.\n\n【6】Most likely diagnosis： Paget disease of the breast.\n\n【7】Clinical significance of this finding： Underlying adenocarcinoma of the breast is often present.\n\n【8】CLINICAL CORRELATION\n\n【9】This patient presents with many of the typical clinical symptoms of Paget dis-ease. Paget disease is a rare form of breast cancer that occurs in approximately1 percent of all breast cancer patients. Patients usually present with symptoms in the sixth decade of life， similar to other common forms of breast cancer. Initial symptoms include erythema and mild eczematous changes of the nipple skin. Scaling and flaking of the nipple may advance to crusting， skin erosion， and ulceration with exudation or frank discharge. A patient also may have pru-ritus， tingling， burning， pain， or hypersensitivity around the skin lesion. Approximately 40 to 50 percent of all Paget skin lesions have an underlying breast mass.\n\n【10】The differential diagnosis for patients with scaling skin and erythema of the nipple-areolar complex includes eczema， contact dermatitis， postradiation 删除换行1 dermatitis， and Paget disease. The presence of bilateral eczematous changes on the nipple-areolar complex is seen more commonly with eczema and contact dermatitis but can occur with Paget disease. Eczema often involves the areola， sparing the nipple (rarely seen with Paget disease). Patients with a history of radiation treatment may have postradiation dermatitis. Because of the eczema-tous initial appearance of Paget disease， patients often are started on topical steroids or antibiotics， with transient improvement of symptoms， delaying the diagnosis by an average of 6 months.\n\n【11】Paget disease of the breast invariably has been associated with underlying ductal carcinoma in situ and less commonly with invasive ductal carcinoma. Reports have cited the incidence of underlying carcinoma being as high as>99 percent. Traditionally， Paget disease has been treated with mastectomy； however， recent reports have shown that more conservative treatment may be possible for select patients. A patient’s prognosis is dependent on the extent of the underlying carcinoma and the stage of the disease， similar to that of females with other types of breast cancer.\n\n【12】APPROACHTO PAGET DISEASE AND DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU\n\n【13】Objectives\n\n【14】List the different types of breast cancer.\n\n【15】Describe the most common causes of breast cancer.\n\n【16】Describe the presentation of Paget disease.\n\n【17】Definitions\n\n【18】Ductal carcinoma in situ： Considered a malignant lesion with dysplastic cells of the breast ducts that do not invade beneath the basement membrane.\n\n【19】Paget disease of the nipple： A rare type of breast cancer that presents as a scaly red crusty lesion of the nipple or areola.\n\n【20】DISCUSSION\n\n【21】When one is evaluating a patient with a breast lesion， carcinoma must always be considered. The risk of breast cancer is dependent on many factors， such as age， family history， and the specific characteristics of the lesion in question. Many breast cancers can be localized with aid of mammogram screening before symptoms or lesions are clinically apparent. Several clinical features are common to all invasive cancers of the breast， including a fixed position， retraction and dimpling of the skin or nipple， metastases through lympho-hematogenous routes with a pattern of nodal spread influenced by the location of the tumor， and distant metastases to any organ of the body.\n\n【22】The diagnosis of Paget disease often is delayed because of its eczematous appearance， and this delay can lead to a diagnosis at advanced stages 删除33：<u></u>. When patients present with symptoms suggestive of Paget dis-ease， a diagnosis should be attempted with scrape cytology， superficial epi-dermal shave biopsy， a 2-mm punch biopsy， a wedge incisional biopsy， or rarely nipple excision. An ideal specimen contains adequate epidermis to pro-vide Paget cells and lactiferous ducts. The histologic hallmark finding for Paget disease is the presence of Paget cells in the epidermis of the nipple； these cells are large with pale-staining cytoplasm and nuclei with promi-nent nucleoli. Various stains for mucin， epithelial membrane antigens， and low-molecular-weight keratins further characterize these cells. Paget cells usu-ally are located between the normal keratinocytes of the nipple epidermis and the basement membrane. The keratinocyte layer frequently is disrupted， allow-ing serous fluid to seep through， causing the characteristic crusting and scal-ing of the nipple skin. Paget cells do not invade through the dermal basement membrane and therefore are a form of ductal carcinoma in situ.\n\n【23】Noninvasive (in situ) intraductal carcinomas account for approximately20 to 30 percent of carcinomas of the breast and today are detected more fre-quently with the use of mammography. This malignant population of cells lacks the ability to invade through the basement membrane and thus is incapable of distant metastasis. These cells can spread throughout the ductal system and\n\n【24】删除3：<u>Figure 18-2. Mammary Paget disease： A sharply demarcated red plaque mim-icking eczema or psoriasis on the nipple.

There is usually a marked increase in dense， fibrous tissue stroma， giving the tumor a hard con-sistency. On gross examination， the tumor averages 1 to 2 cm in size and has a stony-hard consistency. The tumor consists of malignant duct lining cells deposed in cords， solid cell nests， tubules， and glands. The cells invade the connective tissue stroma and frequently invade perivascular and perineural spaces.

Proteus causes UTIs after urethral contamination with fecal bacteria followed by ascension into the bladder. Most infections occur in patients with structural abnormalities or long-term catheters of the urinary tract. Proteus infections can result in significant renal damage by several mechanisms. Proteus produces large amounts of urease, which breaks down urea into carbon dioxide and ammonia and results in elevated urinary pH levels. High urinary pH can contribute to direct renal toxicity and also can result in increased urinary stone formation. Urinary stones can result in further renal damage by obstructing urine flow and serving as a focus of ongoing infection. Crystalline material tends to build up inside of a long-term catheter, leading to biofilm formation. This can essentially block flow through the catheter. Proteus is also among the most common causes of bacteremia in the family Enterobacteriaceae, and is often associated with underlying disease such as diabetes, malignancy, or heart or lung disease. Bacteremia is usually secondary to primary UTI. Pediatric meningitis with Proteus species, especially in the first week of life, has a high mortality rate and a predilection for abscess formation when the organism gains access to the brain. It is hypothesized that the organisms gain entry into the blood through the umbilicus and from the blood they disseminated into the brain.\n\n【12】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【13】#### Proteus Mirabilis Infection\n\n【14】### OBJECTIVES\n\n【15】1\\. Know the structure and characteristics of P. mirabilis .\n\n【16】2\\. Know the mechanisms by which P. mirabilis produces renal damage.\n\n【17】### DEFINITIONS\n\n【18】NEPHROLITHIASIS: The presence of calculi (solid, crystalline) that develops in the kidney and pass through the genitourinary tract\n\n【19】HYDRONEPHROSIS: Enlargement of the kidney because of an abnormality, such as the presence of stones\n\n【20】### DISCUSSION\n\n【21】Characteristics of Proteus Species\n\n【22】The genus Proteus includes 5 species, the most common of which are P. mirabilis and P. vulgaris. Proteus species are commonly found in the environment and as normal flora in the intestinal tract of humans and other animals. Proteus mirabilis , like other members of the Enterobacteriaceae family, is a non–spore-forming, facultative anaerobic, gram-negative bacillus. Proteus has fimbriae, which facilitate attachment to uroepithelium, and flagellae, which provide the motility required for ascending infection. Proteus also has the ability to transform from a single cell form to a multicell elongated (swarmer) form. The swarmer cells are more likely to be associated with cellular adherence in the kidney as demonstrated in an animal model of infection. Hemolysin, which induces cell damage by forming pores, may also play a role in establishment of pyelonephritis.\n\n【23】### DIAGNOSIS\n\n【24】Diagnosis of UTI is initially by the urinalysis followed by a culture. The presence of leukocyte esterase, which is an indicator of the presence of white blood cells, in this patient indicated presumptive UTI. The increased urinary pH as well as the evidence of a stone by computed tomography indicated an obstructive process. Gram stain of the urine may be helpful if a significantly large number of organisms are present in the urine (>10 <sup>5 </sup> colony-forming units \\[CFU\\]/mL). Culture of urine would likely be diagnostic after 24 hours. Members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, the most common cause of UTIs in an otherwise healthy young person, should grow rapidly on blood as well as MacConkey agars. The presence of at least 10 <sup>5 </sup> CFUs/mL in the urine of a single organism would indicate a significant pathogen. Proteus is easily identified on a MacConkey agar plate as a clear colony (nonlactose fermenter). The obvious swarm seen on blood agar would indicate a Proteus species. Definitive confirmation of P. mirabilis would be made by biochemical tests included in most commercially available identification systems. A quick test to differentiate P. mirabilis and P. vulgaris would be indole positivity in the latter.\n\n【25】### TREATMENT AND PREVENTION\n\n【26】Proteus species are usually among the most susceptible genera of all of the Enterobacteriaceae and are most susceptible to penicillin, although it is not uncommon for them to be resistant to tetracyclines. However, Proteus vulgaris tends to be resistant to more antimicrobials than P. mirabilis . As is the case with most bacteria, new resistance mechanisms are being seen in otherwise susceptible organisms.\n\n【27】###", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Unfortunately， only a minority of patients with adrenal incidentalomas undergo appropriate workup. Although Cushing syndrome (CS) is asso-ciated with physical and metabolic changes，approxi-mately half of patients with adrenal CS are diagnosed incidentally， suggesting poor recognition of CS in the clinical practice. Undiagnosed CS may present with abnormal menses and infertility.2 During pregnancy， unrecognized and untreated CS may be associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes.3.4\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 41-year-old woman presented for evaluation of an adrenal mass. After searching online for a rea-son for her symptoms， she came across a descrip-tion of “Cushing syndrome\" and requested further workup. She reported a 5-year history of progres-sive muscle weakness， weight gain， episodes of dia-phoresis， and menstrual irregularity. Over the prior2 years， she developed moon facies， dorsocervical and supraclavicular pads， erythema， insomnia， dif-ficulty concentrating， and an increase in anxiety and depression. She was diagnosed with new onset hypertension and dyslipidemia 2 years ago. Over-all， she gained 50 pounds over the prior 5 years， and 20 pounds in the prior 2 years.\n\n【5】Several years ago， after unsuccessfully attempt-ing to conceive for 12 months， she pursued fertility therapy. During pregnancy， she developed gesta-tional diabetes that necessitated insulin therapy.\n\n【6】Otherwise， her medical history was positive for nephrolithiasis. Two years prior an abdominal com-puted tomography (CT)scan wasperformed that described a 3-cm right adrenal mass. No hormonal workup was performed at that time.\n\n【7】Her current medications included carvedilol、losar-tan， sertraline， and alprazolam. On physical examina-tion， her blood pressure was 138/88 mmHg and body mass index was 46.64 kg/m2. She had no striae or proximal myopathy but did have a dorsocervical pad， supraclavicular pads， and rounding and erythema of the face. She had minimal edema of the lower extremities.\n\n【8】INVESTIGATIONS\n\n【9】Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen that was per-formed recently was reviewed and compared to the CT performed 2 years prior. The most recent CT demon-strated a stable 3.3×2.1×3.1-cm right adrenal mass删除33：<u></u>. The left adrenal gland was atrophic. Hor-monal workup for hypercortisolism was performed， including morning measurement of ACTH and dehy-droepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S)， 1-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test (DST)， and 24-hour urinary free cortisol excretion. The laboratory data were consistent with ACTH-independent hypercorti-solism . Laparoscopic adrenalectomy was recommended.\n\n【10】TREATMENT\n\n【11】The patient was treated with a laparoscopic right adrenalectomy at an institution other than ours， with pathologic analysis demonstrating an adrenocortical adenoma.

An opportunity for an earlier diagnosis was lost when the incidental discovery of an adrenal mass several years prior was dismissed as not clinically significant， without any workup at that time. Assuming another diagnosis is not obvious (e.g.，pheochromocytoma)， a DST should be performed in all patients with an adrenal mass， regard-less of symptoms of hormone excess. Our patient was diagnosed with overt CS， as she presented with clini-cal features of hypercortisolism on examination (Box C.1). Biochemical workup was consistent with ACTH-independent hypercortisolism with undetectable ACTH and DHEA-S， abnormal DST， and elevated 24-hour urine cortisol.

Metyrapone is the most commonly used medication used for treatment of CS during pregnancy4.5 In-depth monitoring is required in these cases to document optimal therapy of hypercortisolism， prevent or appropriately treat adrenal insufficiency， observe for possible metyrapone-induced side effects of hypertension and hypokalemia， and adapt any ongoing management of hyperglycemia.\n\n【18】Key Points\n\n【19】Workup for ACTH-independent hypercortisolism is recommended in all patients with an adrenal mass， regardless of symptoms.\n\n【20】●Untreated CS is associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes during pregnancy\n\n【21】●Management of CS during pregnancy depends on its severity， etiology， and the gestational stage at diagnosis， and includes conservative management of comorbidities， surgery， or medical therapy.\n删除20：<u>1\\.

The patient’s identical twin sister decides to undergo genetic testing to determine her chances of developing breast cancer. What mechanism causes the genes that are most commonly tested for breast cancer to become tumorigenic?\n\n【1】> (A) Chromosomal rearrangement\n\n【2】> (B) Dominant negative effect\n\n【3】> (C) Gain of function\n\n【4】> (D) Loss of function\n\n【5】> (E) Viral insertion\n\n【6】 Answer: The correct answer is D . BRCA1 and BRCAl are tumor-suppressor genes whose protein products function in DNA repair. Frameshift or nonsense mutations commonly occur in BRCA1 and BRCA2 and produce truncated protein products. Mutations in these genes result in a gene product that has less or no function, and can lead to DNA instability and subsequent gene rearrangements. Both alleles of these tumor-suppressor genes must be inactivated to cause loss of function of these genes. Mutations to BRCA can increase the risk of many cancers aside from breast cancer.  \nAnswer A is incorrect . The chromosomal alterations in human solid tumors are heterogeneous and complex, and allow for selection of the loss of tumor suppressor genes on the involved chromosome. However, in leukemias and lymphomas, the chromosomal alterations are often simple translocations, in which the breakpoints of chromosomal arms occur at the site of cellular oncogenes. For example, the Philadelphia chromosome in chronic lymphocytic leukemia is produced from a reciprocal translocation involving the ABL oncogene (a tyrosine kinase on chromosome 9) being placed in proximity to the BCR (breakpoint cluster region) on chromosome 22. The expression of the BCR-ABL gene product leads to tumorigenic growth.  \nAnswer B is incorrect . Dominant negative effects occur when the loss of one allele leads to disease, because either the body cannot produce enough of the necessary protein product from just one functioning allele or the mutated allele produces an altered gene product that is antagonistic to the wild-type allele. An example of this is osteogenesis imperfecta, which caused by mutations in the COL1A1 gene. The abnormal gene product from the mutated allele incorporates itself into the collagen matrix, weakening the structure.  \nAnswer C is incorrect . Oncogenes acquire gain-of-function mutations that lead to increased activity of the gene product, which causes uninhibited cellular proliferation. This mutational event typically occurs in a single allele of the oncogene and acts in a dominant fashion. An example of this is the c-Myc gene, which is implicated in Burkitt lymphoma.  \nAnswer E is incorrect . Viral insertion describes the process in which a viral gene is inserted into the host cell and promotes malignant transformation. Human papilloma virus inserts its genes into the cellular DNA. Several of the viral sequences act as oncogenes that promote tumor growth and may cause cervical and anal cancers. The BRCAl and BRCA2 genes are tumor suppressor genes, and have not been shown to be inactivated by viral insertion.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

It is essential to determine the underlying cause and thus initiate appropriate treatment. She has no history or physical examination findings suggestive of hemorrhage or extreme volume losses， so hypovolemic shock is unlikely. She has flat neck veins and clear lung fields， suggesting she does not have right or left heart failure， respectively， so car-diogenic shock (eg， after a myocardial infarction) seems unlikely. Additionally， both hypovolemic and cardiogenic shock typically cause profound peripheral vasoconstriction， resulting in cold， clammy extremities. This patient's extremi-ties are warm and well perfused (inappropriately so) despite serious hypotension， suggesting a distributive form of shock (early septic shock). Older patients may not be able to mount a high fever； importantly， an afebrile patient does not rule out sepsis. With the elevated WBC count with immature forms as well as the urine findings， septic shock as a consequence of UTI seems most likely.\n\n【21】ASYMPTOMATIC BACTERIURIA： A condition in which urine Gram stain or culture is positive， but no clinical signs or symptoms of infection are present. This condition is rarely requires treatment unless the patient is a pregnant woman or immunocompromised (eg， transplant recipients).\n\n【22】CARDIOGENIC SHOCK： Shock due to intracardiac conditions leading to decreased cardiac output， such as arrhythmias， myocardial infarction， and valvular insufficiencies.\n\n【23】DISTRIBUTIVE SHOCK： Shock characterized by peripheral vasodilation (ie， decreased systemic vascular resistance). It is divided into the following types： ana-phylactic shock (caused by a severe type I hypersensitivity reaction)； endocrine shock (caused by an underlying endocrine disease， eg， adrenal failure or myx-edema)； neurogenic shock (caused by trauma to the central nervous system)； and septic shock (caused by a dysregulated immune response to infection).\n\n【24】HYPOVOLEMIC SHOCK： Shock due to volume depletion causing decreased intravascular volume， which leads to a compensatory increase in systemic vascular resistance in an attempt to maintain adequate tissue perfusion. Caused by hemor-rhagic (eg， gastrointestinal bleeding) and nonhemorrhagic (eg， dehydration， third-spacing) etiologies.\n\n【25】OBSTRUCTIVE SHOCK： Shock due to extracardiac conditions leading to decreased cardiac output， such as pulmonary embolism， tension pneumothorax， and pericardial tamponade.\n\n【26】SEPSIS： A life-threatening multiorgan dysfunction due to dysregulated host response to an infection.\n\n【27】SEPSIS SCORING SYSTEMS： There are various sepsis scoring systems such as SOFA (sequential organ failure assessment) score or simplified qSOFA (quick SOFA) that attempts to estimate morbidity or mortality risk due to sepsis.\n\n【28】SEPTIC SHOCK： Subset of sepsis with circulatory and metabolic/cellular dys-function that is associated with a higher mortality risk.\n\n【29】SHOCK： A life-threatening condition due to circulatory failure leading to hypo-tension and thus inadequate oxygen delivery to and utilization by tissues. There are four main categories： cardiogenic， distributive， hypovolemic， and obstructive shock.\n\n【30】SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE SYNDROME (SIRS)： Criteria that 删除换行1 illustrate systemic inflammation that may or may not indicate underlying infection. The criteria include temperature deviation (> 38 ℃ or <36℃)， tachypnea (respira-tory rate > 20 breaths per minute or Paco，<32 mm Hg)， tachycardia (heart rate>90 bpm)， and leukocyte shifts with WBC > 12，000/mm’or<4000/mm'or> 10%immature forms (bands).\n\n【31】Epidemiology\n\n【32】UTIs are a common affliction of the elderly， affecting both debilitated and healthy adults. UTIs are second only to respiratory infections as the most common infections in patients older than 65 years. Risk factors that contribute to the high incidence of UTIs in the elderly， as well as in institutionalized patients， include incontinence， a history of prior UTIs， neurologic impairment， immunosuppression， poor nutri-tion， and comorbid disease states. These conditions may confer functional abnor-malities within the urinary tract or altered defenses against infection. Furthermore， frequent hospitalizations expose these patients to nosocomial pathogens and inva-sive instrumentation， such as indwelling catheters.\n\n【33】Pathophysiology\n\n【34】Most UTIs occur as one of three clinical syndromes： acute uncomplicated cystitis(lower tract infection)， acute pyelonephritis (upper tract infection)， or catheter-associated UTI (in hospitalized， institutionalized， or neurogenic bladder patients). Symptoms of cystitis reflect bladder irritation and generally include dysuria， increased frequency， urgency， or hematuria. Pyelonephritis typically presents with systemic symptoms such as fever， chills， or nausea； flank pain； and findings of WBC casts on urinalysis. Catheter-associated UTI can be diagnosed by fever， suprapubic pain， or other symptoms attributable to infection， along with a positive urine cul-ture in patients with permanent or intermittent catheterization of the urinary tract.\n\n【35】Another common situation that deserves mention is asymptomatic bacteriuria. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is characterized by positive urine culture without clini-cal symptoms. Outside of pregnancy or immunocompromised patients such as transplant recipients， no adverse clinical outcomes have been reported as a result of asymptomatic bacteriuria， and no benefits of treatment have been demonstrated.\n\n【36】Diagnostic Criteria. UTIs typically are diagnosed based on a combination of symptoms and urinary findings. In symptomatic patients， bacteria typically are found in high concentrations in the urine， and 105 colony-forming units (CFUs)/mL typically are recovered from a clean-catch specimen. If the specimen is obtained by catheterization， finding more than 10? CFU/mL is considered significant. In women with symptoms of acute cystitis (such as dysuria， frequency， and urinary tenesmus)， urine cultures are often not obtained， but empiric treatment can be initiated based on the dipstick findings of leukocyte esterase (used as a marker for pyuria) or nitrites(produced by some bacteria that cause UTIs).\n\n【37】Clinical Presentation\n\n【38】Fever， dysuria， urgency， or flank pain may be presenting symptoms for a UTI in younger patients. However， elderly and institutionalized patients often present with less obvious symptoms. These patients may be febrile or hypothermic. Com-mon manifestations include confusion or combativeness. Mental status or behay-ioral changes in the elderly should be considered strong indicators for serious illness， and a thorough workup should consider etiologies beyond infections. Even with localizing symptoms suggestive of a UTI， other sources of infection should still\n\n| Table 41-1·ETIOLOGIES OF URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS  |\n| --- |\n| Acute uncomplicated cystitis， pyelonephritis ·Escherichia coli 75%-90% ·Staphylococcus saprophyticus 5%-15% ·Klebsiella spp ·Proteus spp ·Enterococcus spp  |\n| Catheter-associated UTI ·Escherichia coli Klebsiella spp ·Proteus spp ·Staphylococcus aureus ·Citrobacter spp ·Morganella spp ·Pseudomonas aeruginosa ·Enterococcus spp ·Candida spp  |\n\n【40】be investigated. Both urine and blood cultures should be obtained in addition to a urinalysis and complete blood count (CBC). The results of the urine and blood cultures may take 2 to 3 days to yield an organism. If the clinical picture suggests a UTI and sepsis， antibiotic treatment should be initiated immediately. Empiric anti-microbial therapy can be directed at the most common pathogens .\n\n【41】Treatment\n\n【42】For uncomplicated cystitis， oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole， fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin， and nitrofurantoin are acceptable first-line therapies and are typically given for 3 days. Empiric therapy should be guided by knowledge of local antibiotic resistance patterns. Similar empiric treatment may be initiated for pyelonephritis， but urine and blood cultures should be obtained. Treatment is then guided by culture results and should be continued for 10 to 14 days. Catheter-associated UTI can only be diagnosed with a positive culture (the sample should be obtained from a new catheter， or the catheter port， but not the drainage bag)， and antibiotic therapy is tailored to the identified pathogen. If possible， the catheter should be removed or replaced. Bacteria commonly secrete a biofilm in which they embed， making the full sterilization of the urine less likely.\n\n【43】Elderly and institutionalized patients commonly acquire gram-positive and mixed infections， so broad-spectrum antibiotics pending culture results are recom-mended. In patients presenting with a clinical picture of sepsis， broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms， includ-ing antipseudomonal activity， is recommended until cultures are available to guide therapy. The duration of therapy should be dictated by the patient's clinical status. In cases where UTIs have progressed to bacteremia， aggressive and prompt treat-ment is necessary to prevent the onset of septic shock. This life-threatening state may develop with little warning in elderly and institutionalized patients with mul-tiple comorbidities， as it did in the patient in the case， who presented with hypoten-sion and altered mental status because of infection， that is in septic shock.\n\n【44】CLINICAL APPROACHTO SHOCK\n\n【45】Pathophysiology\n\n【46】Shock is the clinical syndrome that results from inadequate tissue perfusion. It can be classified in a variety of ways， but one useful schema divides the causes into hypovolemic shock， cardiogenic shock， or distributive shock， usually caused by sepsis. Hypovolemic shock is the most common form. It results from either hemor-rhage or profound vomiting or diarrhea， resulting in loss of 20% to 40% of blood volume. Cardiogenic shock results from a primary cardiac insult， such as a myo-cardial infarction， arrhythmia， or end-stage systolic heart failure. Both hypovole-mic and cardiogenic shock cause a marked fall in cardiac output and may appear clinically similar with tachycardia， hypotension， and cold， clammy extremities. It is essential to differentiate between the two， however， because the treatments are markedly different. Patients with hypovolemic shock should have flat neck veins and clear lung fields； those with cardiogenic shock are more likely to have markedly elevated jugular venous pressure and pulmonary edema.\n\n【47】Distributive shock， in contrast， is characterized by an increase in cardiac output but an inability to maintain systemic vascular resistance， that is， there is inappro-priate vasodilation. Clinically， it appears different from the other forms of shock in that， despite the hypotension， the extremities are warm and well perfused， at least initially. If septic shock continues， cardiac output falls as a consequence of myocar-dial depression， multiorgan dysfunction ensues， and intense vasoconstriction occurs in an attempt to maintain blood pressure， the so-called cold phase. These findings portend a poor prognosis； hence， prompt recognition of septic shock in the early(warm) phase is paramount.\n\n【48】Although distributive shock may occur in neurogenic shock as a consequence of spinal cord injury or adrenal crisis， the most common cause is septic shock， with the most common infectious etiologies of sepsis being UTIs and pneumonia. Septic shock is associated with high 30-day mortality rates， exceeding 50%. Early diagno-sis and prompt treatment are imperative because untreated shock progresses to an irreversible point that is refractory to volume expansion and other medical thera-pies. The qSOFA score is a rapid， bedside assessment of three variables： Glasgow Coma Score (≤ 14)， systolic blood pressure (≤ 100 mm Hg)， and respiratory rate(> 22 breaths per minute). The presence of two of those three is associated with high mortality.\n\n【49】New Terminology. In 2016， the International Sepsis Consensus Conference(Sepsis-3) recommended deemphasizing the use of SIRS (nonspecific) and instead adopting SOFA as a more accurate prognostic indicator of the effects of sepsis. Their recommendation is that a total SOFA score of two or more points from base-line represents organ dysfunction； however， the SOFA scores are research tools and have not yet been validated widely in clinical practice.\n\n【50】Treatment\n\n【51】Treatment of hypovolemic shock is aggressive volume resuscitation， either with crystalloid solution or with blood products， as necessary. Treatment of cardiogenic shock focuses on maintaining blood pressure with dopamine or norepinephrine 删除换行1 infusions， relief of pulmonary edema with diuretics， and reducing cardiac afterload， for example， with an intra-aortic balloon pump.\n\n【52】The initial treatment for distributive shock is isotonic fluid resuscitation to maintain adequate intravascular volume. Other cornerstones of therapy include broad-spectrum antibiotics targeted to the underlying infection and removing the source of the infection. Patients often require vasopressor support (norepinephrine is the agent of choice) and mechanical ventilation to optimize tissue oxygenation. Vasopressors increase systemic vascular resistance via vasoconstriction to increase organ perfusion. The three main subtypes are catecholamine-， smooth muscle-， and dopaminergic receptor-targeting vasopressors. Catecholamine vasopressors target the alpha and/or beta receptors and include phenylephrine， norepinephrine， and epinephrine. Vasopressin acts on smooth muscle V-1 receptors and renal V-2receptors for vasoconstrictive and antidiuretic uses， respectively； it has no iono-tropic or chronotropic effects. Dopamine acts on dopaminergic， alpha， and beta receptors in a dose-dependent manner. IV hydrocortisone may be administered to patients with hypotension that is refractory to fluid resuscitation and vasopressors.\n\n【53】Surviving Sepsis Campaign. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign is an international collaborative that develops evidence-based guidelines on reducing morbidity and mortality. Some of the key recommendations include\n\n【54】Hour-1 bundle for expected interventions， therapy， and goals\n\n【55】Early administration of antibiotics\n\n【56】Early use of serum lactate and if elevated， measure again\n\n【57】Vasopressors if hypotension continues despite IV fluids\n删除16：<u>CASE CORRELATION\n删除25：<u>See also Case 40 (Anaphylaxis/Drug Reactions) and Case 42 (Vascular Catheter Infection in a Patient With Neutropenic Fever).</u>\n</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

You have been treating her mild  删除换行1 hypertension for years with a beta-blocker and a diuretic. She is a frail woman of the ‘old  删除换行1 school’, always neatly turned out and deferring to the doctor in all matters. You inherited her  删除换行1 case from your predecessor when you joined the practice some years ago, and she frequently  删除换行1 refers fondly to old Dr. Jones’ skills.\n\n【3】Today, she has come because of a cough which has troubled her for a couple of weeks. It is now  删除换行1 becoming productive with yellow-green sputum and it keeps her awake and she sometimes  删除换行1 feels a bit feverish. You already know she is a non-smoker. She thinks she may have lost weight  删除换行1 recently, but complains of no other symptoms. She would like some of the cough mixture  删除换行1 which Dr. Jones used to prescribe and which she always found so effective. The computerized  删除换行1 records do not reveal it, but searching through her old paper Lloyd-George envelope, you find  删除换行1 he gave her ‘Mist. Ipecac. et Amm.’ (ammonia and ipecacuanha mixture), which is no longer  删除换行1 listed in the British National Formulary (BNF).\n\n【4】Examination\n\n【5】You ask to examine her. She nods in agreement, removes her coat and unbuttons the top of  删除换行1 her blouse. You ask if she could remove the blouse, so that you can examine the chest properly. ‘Oh, but Dr. Jones never did that’, she declares. You explain that you think it necessary  删除换行1 this time, in order properly to diagnose her case; you ask her if she would like the nurse  删除换行1 to come in as a chaperone. She says that is not necessary, but only reluctantly removes the  删除换行1 blouse. You then see that she has padded out the right side of her bra with a cotton-wool  删除换行1 dressing. You ask her to remove this, which she does again reluctantly, to reveal a large fungating frank carcinoma of the right breast.\n\n【6】Under direct questioning, she admits this has been present for some months, but she has been  删除换行1 too embarrassed and frightened to mention it. It is not as painful as you might have expected,  删除换行1 and she thought it would go away by itself. You ask her gently if she knows what it is, and she  删除换行1 says quite candidly, ‘Yes, it’s cancer, my sister died of it 20 years ago’.\n\n【7】Questions\n\n【8】• What action would you take now?\n\n【9】• Whom, apart from a consultant surgeon, would you like to involve in her case?\n\n【10】• How do you diplomatically explain that your management may differ from a  删除换行1 colleague’s?\n\n【11】ANSWER 13\n\n【12】You complete the examination, checking the other breast, the lymph nodes and elsewhere  删除换行1 for signs of metastases. You do not forget to examine her chest, which reveals some basal  删除换行1 rales. You explain that you agree with her guess and even though it is late you think some  删除换行1 treatment would make her more comfortable and may prolong her life. You discuss surgery,  删除换行1 radiotherapy and chemotherapy with her, and she agrees to attend the hospital clinic. You  删除换行1 immediately fax an urgent referral form under the 2-week rule, to the breast unit. You also  删除换行1 ask if she would like the community (district) nurse to help her with dressings and suggest  删除换行1 that the local palliative team nurse be contacted for support. Finally, you offer her some antibiotic for her chest infection, explaining that nowadays this is thought more effective than  删除换行1 cough mixture, though you can give her simple linctus as well. You ask her to see you after  删除换行1 her hospital appointment, to discuss the specialist’s advice.\n\n【13】• Resist the temptation to chastise patients for failing to attend earlier.

What is the treatment?\n通用删除5(英):<u>DOI: 10.1201/9781003242697-</u>\nANSWERS\n\n【7】This patient has the features of an uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI). Recent-onset  删除换行1 fever and back pain suggest an upper UTI.\nUTIs are classified by anatomy into lower and upper UTIs. Lower UTIs refer to infections at  删除换行1 or below the level of the bladder and include cystitis, urethritis, prostatitis, and epididymitis  删除换行1 (the latter three being more often sexually transmitted). Upper UTIs refer to infection above  删除换行1 the bladder and include the ureters and kidneys. Infection of the urinary tract above the bladder is known as pyelonephritis. UTIs are also classified as complicated or uncomplicated.\nUTIs in men, the elderly, pregnant women, those who have an indwelling catheter and those  删除换行1 with anatomic or functional abnormality of the urinary tract are considered to be complicated. A complicated UTI will often receive longer courses of broader-spectrum antibiotics.\nImportantly, the clinical history alone of dysuria and frequency (without vaginal discharge) 删除换行1 is associated with more than 90% probability of a UTI in healthy women.\nUrine dipsticks are one of the most widely used tests, although interpreting the results is  删除换行1 not simple. A positive result for both nitrites and leukocyte esterase has a higher sensitivity  删除换行1 than a positive result for only one of the two. Nitrites are not normally found in the urine  删除换行1 but are produced by the action of certain (but not all) bacteria on urinary nitrate. A positive leucocyte esterase test indicates the presence of neutrophils, a marker of infection. This  删除换行1 infection may be a UTI, but may also be caused by other infections of the genitourinary  删除换行1 tract. Collecting urine for microscopy, culture and sensitivity (MC&S) is the gold standard  删除换行1 for diagnosing a UTI.\nIn women, a UTI develops when urinary pathogens from the bowel or vagina colonise the  删除换行1 urethral mucosa and ascend via the urethra into the bladder. During an uncomplicated  删除换行1 symptomatic UTI in women, it is rare for infection to ascend via the ureter into the kidney  删除换行1 to cause pyelonephritis.\nRisk factors for a UTI include being female (shorter urethra that is close to the anus), previous UTI, a urinary catheter, intercourse (which promotes movement of organisms up the  删除换行1 urethra), use of spermicides and new sex partners.\nUTI in men is uncommon and usually occurs secondary to an underlying structural or functional abnormality of the urogenital tract resulting in obstruction to urine flow. The most  删除换行1 common of these is prostate enlargement.\nBacteria causing UTI have enhanced virulence through structures such as P fimbriae, which  删除换行1 promote attachment to the uroepithelium. Escherichia coli causes 80–90% of communityacquired UTI. By contrast, only 40% of health care–associated UTIs are caused by E. coli.The remainder are largely due to other enteric Gram-negative bacteria such as Klebsiella,  删除换行5 Enterobacter, Serratia, and Pseudomonas species. Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus  删除换行1 aureus and enterococci may also cause health care–associated UTIs.\nMost health care–associated UTIs are associated with the use of urinary catheters. Each day  删除换行1 the catheter remains in situ, the risk of UTI rises by around 5%. Thus inserting catheters  删除换行1 only when absolutely needed and ensuring they are removed as soon as possible can prevent  删除换行1 these. In catheterised patients, the catheter becomes colonised with organisms sticking to its  删除换行1 surface. These ascend into the bladder more easily as the urethral defences are bypassed.\nProteus species are associated with kidney stones as it produces the enzyme urease, which  删除换行1 converts urea into ammonia, subsequently making the urine more alkaline, favouring stone  删除换行1 development. Case 82: Burning Sensation When Passing Urine 251 \n\n【8】Complications of a UTI include: \n\n【9】•\t Recurrent cystitis in women, caused by reinfection rather than dormancy of pathogens in the uroepithelium or by ineffective treatment. There is no association  删除换行1 between recurrent UTI and urinating habits, use of tampons, pre-coital or postcoital voiding patterns and daily fluid intake.\n•\t Pyelonephritis, caused by bacterial migration from the bladder (via the ureters) to  删除换行1 the kidneys. This may be life threatening or lead to permanent kidney damage if  删除换行1 not promptly treated.\n• Sepsis, which can be caused by bacteria entering the bloodstream.\nUp to 40% of uncomplicated lower UTIs in women will resolve spontaneously without antimicrobial therapy. The use of antibiotics in this cohort is controversial when taking into  删除换行1 account the side effects of antibiotics and their effect on normal flora. For this reason, a  删除换行1 backup prescription of antibiotics can be given for uncomplicated lower UTIs to be used  删除换行1 if symptoms get worse or do not improve in 48 hours. The antibiotics should be a short  删除换行1 course (3 days) of a narrow spectrum, such as trimethoprim or nitrofurantoin. Resistance to  删除换行1 trimethoprim is very high in certain areas. Complicated and upper UTIs require a longer  删除换行1 course (e.g. 7 days) of a more broad-spectrum antibiotic such as co-amoxiclav, quinolones or  删除换行1 aminoglycosides.\nKEY POINTS \n\n【10】• E. coli causes 80–90% of community-acquired UTI.\n• Urine dipsticks are widely used, but their results must be interpreted with caution,  删除换行1 as a significant number of false-positive and false-negative results can occur.\n• An uncomplicated lower UTI is treated with a narrow-spectrum antibiotic for a  删除换行1 short course. A complicated or upper UTI requires a longer course of a broadspectrum antibiotic.\n• Most health care–associated UTIs are associated with the use of urinary catheters.\nEach day the catheter remains in situ, the risk of UTI rises by around 5%.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

This patient has physical signs consistent with anorexia nervosa, most notably a low body mass index, bradycardia, evidence of hypotension, lanugo, and concomitant depression. Anorexia nervosa is a serious condition that requires intensive mental health care, as well as close medical monitoring of weight, electrolyte levels, and hydration status. The mainstay of therapy is a combination of cognitive behavioral therapy and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Use of the antidepressant bupropion is contraindicated in patients with anorexia nervosa because it increases the risk of seizure in this population.  \nAnswer A is incorrect . Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). TCAs, although effective, are not first-line therapy in the management of anorexia nervosa, given the potential for cardiac adverse effects in anorexic patients already suffering from bradycardia and electrolyte abnormalities. TCAs are not known to increase the risk of seizure in anorexic patients.  \nAnswer C is incorrect . Fluoxetine is an SSRI most commonly used as an antidepressant. It has also been used to treat anorexia nervosa, although with questionable efficacy. SSRIs are not known to increase the risk of seizure in anorexic patients.  \nAnswer D is incorrect . Mirtazapine in an atypical antidepressant that induces weight gain, which may be beneficial in patients with weight control issues, although this has not yet been studied rigorously.

Although he is not a particularly warm or cuddly child, the patient’s parents did not notice anything unusual in the first year of life. At 16 months, the child had not yet articulated any words although he was noted to babble occasionally and showed no affection to his parents or siblings. He was easily upset, particularly by changes from his usual routine, and soothed himself by rocking back and forth or slowly spinning in a circle. At presentation, the child had not developed any spoken words, and his temperament is irritable and isolative. His parents state that he hardly ever makes eye contact, and if forced by others, he becomes upset. On examination, he is an active and healthy appearing toddler who is wandering around the office, ignoring the doctor and his parents, paying attention only to the books, which he rhythmically pulls off the shelf without playfulness. When his mother tries to keep him from doing so the little boy screams, looks up to the ceiling, flaps his arms, and then retreats to the corner and rocks back and forth. He has a normal toddler gait but seems somewhat uncoordinated for his age when reaching for and grasping objects. There are no noted dysmorphic features, and his skin examination is normal. Developmental history in the family is normal. The child’s two older siblings are healthy and neurodevelopmen-tally normal.

He is physically healthy, and there is nothing of note in his prenatal, medical, surgical, or family histories. His examination is significant only for demonstrating the deficits and behaviors reported by the parents.\n\n【8】• Most likely diagnosis : Autism\n\n【9】• Next diagnostic step : Audiological evaluation\n\n【10】• Next step in therapy : Educational intervention and behavioral modification\n\n【11】#### ANALYSIS\n\n【12】##### Objectives\n\n【13】1\\. Understand the difference between developmental delay and developmental regression.\n\n【14】2\\. Know the four domains of development and how to assess them clinically.\n\n【15】3\\. Remember the importance of assessing hearing when evaluating a language delay in a child.\n\n【16】4\\. Know the cardinal features of autism.\n\n【17】##### Clinical Considerations\n\n【18】This 28-month-old boy is brought to the office with concerns about his development and his behavior. Clinically, the most important first step is to carefully distinguish between developmental delay and developmental regression. Delay implies that the child is making progress, although at a rate slower than that considered to be normal. This is generally because of a static process and can lead to an eventual diagnosis of mental retardation. Developmental regression, conversely, implies that the child is now losing previously attained skills and raises the possibility of a progressive neurodegenerative process. Distinguishing between delay and regression can be clinically difficult, at times. For example, a child can inconsistently demonstrate a new developmental skill leading to the impression that it has been lost. True developmental regression is a red flag , which necessitates an expedited search for a progressive disorder of the nervous system . In this patient, however, there is no hint of developmental regression but instead a picture of developmental delay.\n\n【19】Evaluation of problems with development is facilitated by assessing four distinct developmental aspects: gross motor skills, fine motor skills, personal–social interactions, and language capabilities. An isolated language deficit, for example, can be caused by hearing impairment alone, while global developmental delay (involving all four domains) is more likely to be caused by a significant in utero, perinatal, or genetic disturbance. A delay in gross motor skills arising prior to 1 year of age strongly suggests the diagnosis of cerebral palsy. Assessing which developmental spheres are impacted is facilitated by the use of the Denver Developmental Screening Test (DDST), and confirmed with more sophisticated psychometric measures that are available, either for use in the office or on referral to a pediatric neuropsychologist.\n\n【20】Applying such an approach to this patient reveals that although the child is meeting gross motor milestones appropriately, he is slightly behind in fine motor skills and disproportionately significantly delayed in the language and personal–social domains. With respect to language, children normally begin babbling by approximately 6 months of age, articulate one word by approximately 1 year of life, and by 2 years of age are able to combine two words to form rudimentary sentences as well as follow simple verbal commands. This patient, at age 28 months, is therefore significantly delayed given that he is only able to babble and does not seem to follow commands. Although most newborns are screened for hearing problems in the newborn nursery (using a neurophysiologic test called Auditory Brainstem Evoked Responses ), clinicians must be sure that hearing is normal when faced with a language delay. This patient, however, has delays in more than just the language domain. By parental report and based on observations, he also has significant problems with social reciprocity. He is not affectionate toward his parents and is unable to maintain eye contact. At times he seems to treat people in the same detached way that he treats other objects around him. Although solitary play is a normal developmental stage, this child has never progressed to including any type of social play, which is certainly abnormal at his age. Furthermore, he has a variety of odd and idiosyncratic behaviors. For example, he is fascinated with removing books from shelves but does so in a mechanical way rather than a playful one. Also, he uses repetitive behaviors such as rocking, slowly spinning, or rapidly flapping his hands in order to soothe himself when upset rather than seeking comfort from his caretakers. These repetitive stereotyped self-stimulating behaviors are referred to as stereotypies and are commonly seen in children with autism or autistic spectrum disorders. Taken together, this child’s clinical condition appears to meet criteria for autism.\n\n【21】### APPROACH TO: Autism\n\n【22】#### DEFINITIONS\n\n【23】AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER (ASD) OR PERVASIVE DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDER (PDD) : Disorders characterized by varying degrees of impairment in communication skills, social interactions, and restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped patterns of behavior.\n\n【24】ASPERGER SYNDROME : One of five neurobiologic PDDs and is characterized by deficiencies in social and communication skills, normal to above normal intelligence, and standard language development.\n\n【25】DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY : Developmental delay occurs when children have not reached these milestones by the expected time period for all five areas of development or just one (cognitive, language and speech, social and emotional, fine motor, and gross motor).\n\n【26】#### CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【27】Autism is a condition toward the more severe end of a spectrum of neurobehavioral disorders that involve deficits in communication, social interactions, and behavior. The diagnosis is made clinically according to criteria detailed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR). First, with regards to social deficits, a patient must have at least two of the following:\n\n【28】1\\. Marked impairment in the use of multiple nonverbal behaviors such as eye-to-eye gaze, facial expression, body posture, and gestures necessary to regulate social interaction\n\n【29】2\\. Failure to develop peer relationships\n\n【30】3\\. Lack of spontaneous seeking to share enjoyment, interests, or achievement with other people\n\n【31】4\\. Lack of social or emotional reciprocity\n\n【32】Second, in terms of communication skills, a patient must have at least one of the following:\n\n【33】1\\. Delay in, or total lack of, the development of spoken language\n\n【34】2\\. In individuals with adequate speech, marked impairment in the ability to initiate or sustain a conversation with others\n\n【35】3\\. Stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language\n4\\.

Encompassing preoccupation with one or more stereotyped and restricted patterns of interest that is abnormal either in intensity or focus\n\n【37】2\\. Apparently inflexible adherence to specific, nonfunctional routines or rituals\n\n【38】3\\. Stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms\n4\\. Persistent preoccupation with parts of objects rather than the whole 删除换行5 Furthermore, six of the above symptoms (in any category) must be evident in the child prior to 3 years of age. If findings suggestive of autism are obtained by history or on a developmental screening examination, then the patient should be referred for more detailed evaluation by a clinician familiar with the formal diagnosis of autism.\n\n【39】In addition to autism, there are other conditions along this disease continuum (referred to as ASD ). It affects an estimated 3.4 of every 1000 children aged 3 to 10 years although rates vary depending on reports. The ASDs can often be reliably detected by the age of 3 years, and in some cases as early as 18 months.\n\n【40】Children with normal language but with restricted interests, abnormal behaviors, and poorly developed social interaction can have Asperger syndrome. At times these children are difficult to distinguish from high functioning children with autism (those with an IQ in the average range). Patients who develop autistic symptoms older than age 3 years are less impaired than typical autistic patients, or those who otherwise have atypical features can be diagnosed with PDD not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). ASDs are more common in boys than in girls (4:1) and have an overall prevalence rate of approximately 60 per 10,000 people. The most frequently encountered type of ASD is PDD-NOS, followed by autistic disorder, with Asperger syndrome being the least common subtype.\n\n【41】Although the cause of ASD is unknown, increasing evidence points to an underlying pathophysiologic process ongoing long before the developmental delays become evident and likely present from birth. Although multiple brain regions are likely to be involved in such a complex disorder, it appears as though the frontal lobe and the amygdala are significantly involved. This makes sense given the frontal lobe’s involvement in regulating emotion, and behavior, as well as the role of the amygdala in mediating the response to stress. Recently there has been a flurry of research investigating a possible link between routine childhood vaccinations containing the preservative thimerosal and autism. Although large epidemiologic studies have failed to support this linkage, it remains a significant concern in the minds of many parents and might need to be addressed directly with them.\n\n【42】#### MANAGEMENT\n\n【43】Perhaps the most important aspect of management in patients with autism is a well-designed appropriately structured educational environment. Given that autism is a developmental disorder, it is vital to begin such interventions early to maximize the development of the child’s potential. Additionally, behavioral interventions can be very helpful both for the patient as well as for the family and caretakers. Pharmacologic interventions are, at times, employed although there currently are not many large clinical trials to support this. Smaller studies have suggested that the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic medication can have some benefit. It should be noted that no medication currently has an indication from the FDA for use in treating the symptoms of autism. It is not surprising, therefore, that many complementary and alternative treatments have been promoted for these patients: mercury chelation therapy, intravenous secretin treatments, and a host of supplements. Parents should be asked about the use of such therapies and counseled about their potential dangers.\n\n【44】##### Prognosis\n\n【45】The disease usually is nonprogressive, although occasionally, as an affected child grows, additional deficits can be evident. Although less affected individuals can develop improvement in social relationships, the outlook for those children that are significantly affected is poor. The degree of language impairment and intelligence ability usually predict outcome of eventual function; a child that has not learned to speak by 5 years of age usually will not gain communicative ability.\n\n【46】####", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Her mother states that despite using generous emollients and hydrocortisone, the girl scratches rigorously at night and is unable to concentrate during school due to pruritus. She has a past medical history of moderate intermittent asthma and allergic rhinitis, and her mother reports a strong history of asthma on her side of the family without any dermatologic issues.

Atopic dermatitis also commonly known as eczema, is a common chronic inflammatory disorder of the skin, with a prevalence of up to 30% in children and 10% in adults. Atopic dermatitis is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. There are two sets of genes that have been implicated: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> genes encoding epidermal proteins such as filaggrin ( FLG ) and serine protease inhibitor LETKI ( SPINK5 ) and 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> genes encoding immunologic proteins such as high-affinity IgE receptors ( FCER1A ), toll-like receptor-2 ( TLR-2 ) and different interleukins ( IL4, IL5, IL12B, IL13 ), among others. Ichthyosis vulgaris, which is an autosomal semidominant disorder of the skin caused by a mutation in FLG , is seen in up to 15% of patients with AD.\n\n【9】Due to genetic factors, patients with atopic dermatitis have an impaired epidermal barrier that is characterized by epidermal barrier dysfunction and increased transepidermal water loss as a result of an altered stratum corneum.\n\n【10】ii. Atopic stigmata are associated features observed in patients with atopic dermatitis. One of the most important cutaneous features observed in patients with atopic dermatitis is xerosis, characterized by dry skin with fine scale, often worse during the winter. Xerosis promotes pruritus, which can lead to inflammation through the release of proinflammatory cytokines by keratinocytes due to scratching.\n\n【11】Additional stigmata include palmar hyperlinearity, white dermatographism, periorbital darkening, pityriasis alba, infraorbital folds (Dennie–Morgan lines), hypodense lateral eyebrows (Hertoghe’s sign) and low hairline.\n\n【12】iii. Given the extent and areas of involvement, more potent topical steroids would be appropriate for this patient based on the therapeutic ladder for atopic dermatitis. Triamcinolone 0.1% is appropriate for use on most areas of the skin, excluding the skin folds and face, whereas thicker lichenified plaques can be treated with topical corticosteroids with high or very high potency such as fluocinonide or clobetasol, respectively. In addition to topical steroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus, pimecrolimus) have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of AD in prospective controlled trials. Adjunctive therapies include dilute bleach baths, oral antihistamines for antipruritic and sedative effects, cool mist room vaporizers and antibacterial soaps.\n\n【13】Other potential treatments include narrowband UV therapy, cyclosporine, azathioprine, methotrexate and mycophenolate mofetil.

Intravenous agents are also useful in lower doses for sedation. They may also be used for maintenance of anesthe-sia in conjunction with inhalational anesthetics， or instead of inhalational anesthetics when the later are contraindicated (such as in malignant hyper-thermia， case on strabismus) or where it is impractical for an anesthesia machine to be present.\n\n【6】ANALYSIS\n\n【7】Objective\n\n【8】Introduce the student to the more common intravenous anesthetics including their properties， uses， and potential side effects.\n\n【9】Considerations\n\n【10】This patient can have an anesthetic cream placed on the arm， and then an i.v. placed with minimal pain. During the procedure， he will be anes-thetized with a continuous infusion of propofol， an intravenous agent， and intubated with an endotracheal tube prior to entering the MRI machine. A continuous infusion such as this does not require metal equipment such as an anesthesia machine， and is thus an option in this circumstance.\n\n【11】“Intravenous anesthetics\"do not necessarily include intravenous opi-oids. Opioids are analgesics， and do not cause general anesthesia per se， unless used in very large doses.

It has gained its popularity because it is associated with a pleasant， rapid loss of consciousness， rapid awakening， and seemingly fewer residual effects on patient's brain. Its chemical structure is an alkyl phenol， and some of its behavioral effects seem to resemble those observed with alcohol.\n\n【21】Propofol is used as a bolus for the induction of anesthesia， in doses ranging from 1.5 to 2.5 mg/kg. The administration of propofol can cause significant pain upon injection， which can be attenuated by using an intravenous placed in a large vein， and/or administering lidocaine 0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg i.v. just prior to injecting the propofol. It is also advisable to warn the patient that some burning might occur during injection.\n\n【22】Propofol can also be used for the maintenance of anesthesia. While it is possible to administer propofol for maintenance in multiple boluses， it is best used as continuous infusion since it has a short context-sensitive half-time. Perhaps surprisingly， administering propofol by multiple boluses actually con-sumes more of the drug than a continuous infusion 删除33：<u>通用删除1(英):<u>(please see Figure 1-2)</u></u>. For the maintenance of anesthesia， a loading dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg can be fol-lowed by an infusion of 100 ug/kg/min to be titrated to effect.\n\n【23】Propofol is also useful in lower doses for sedation during regional and mon-itored anesthesia care， and for patients in the intensive care unit. Propofol has never been associated with a case of malignant hyperthermia； so it is the agent of choice for general anesthesia in this setting.\n\n【24】Etomidate\n\n【25】Etomidate is distinguished from the other intravenous agents by its paucity of effects on the cardiovascular system. It causes little or no change in systemic\n\n【26】删除3：<u>Figure 1-2.Administering an intravenous anesthetic using multiple boluses actu-ally consumes more of the drug than a continuous infusion. 删除10：<u>(Reprinted from Reeves JG.

Thus， etomidate is the agent of choice whenever car diovascular stability is potentially an issue. The possible side effects of etomi-date are adrenocortical suppression， myoclonus， and the activation of seizure foci.</u>\n\n【27】Thiopental\n\n【28】Originally known as “sodium pentothal，\" thiopental is mainly used for induc-tion of anesthesia in patients undergoing neurosurgery. Thiopental reduces the brain’s oxygen consumption， and may reduce ischemia-induced brain damage. It is also used intraoperatively for burst suppression， and for the treat-ment of increased intracranial pressure. There is absolutely no merit in the concept that thiopental was a“truth serum.”\n\n【29】Ketamine\n\n【30】Ketamine is an intravenous hypnotic drug that is chemically related to LSD. It produces a dissociative state accompanied by analgesia， unawareness， and nystagmus. When used for induction， it can be associated with “bad dreams”or emergence delirium， although this side effect can be prevented by pretreat-ment with a benzodiazepine.\n\n【31】Ketamine increases systemic blood pressure， heart rate， and cardiac out-put. It has no effect on ventilation， although pretreatment with an antisial-agogue (eg， glycopyrrolate)may be warranted aiss kkeettaammine causes ar increase in respiratory secretions. Ketamine is contraindicated in patients with intracranial pathology， as it increases intracranial pressure and cerebral blood flow.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is associated with berry aneurysms in the circle of Willis and with cyst formation not only in the kidneys but in the liver, pancreas, and spleen. Hypertension is a common early finding, with an average age at onset of 30 years. Later in the course, kidneys can reach sizes triple their normal volumes, often resulting in disabling symptoms due to pressure on intra-abdominal organs. ADPKD does not present at a young age. Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney (ARPKD) disease is diagnosed most often in pediatric patients; it is associated less often with cyst formation in multiple visceral organs and with the formation of berry aneurysms.  \nAnswer B is incorrect . Horseshoe kidney is associated with many renal diseases, but it does not involve the extra-renal findings described in the question.  \nAnswer C is incorrect . Children with inborn errors of metabolism can present with ophthalmologic findings such as cherry-red spots in the macula. An example is Niemann-Pick disease, a lysosomal storage disease in which a sphingomyelinase deficiency results in accumulation of sphingomyelin. The disease is characterized by varying degrees of splenomegaly and neurologic deficits.  \nAnswer D is incorrect . Potter syndrome is a condition involving renal agenesis, and it is not associated with any cystic changes.  \nAnswer E is incorrect .

He denies having any hallucinations or seizures. He states that he had been drinking about a half bottle of hard liquor each day for years. After his wife threatened to divorce him and he was fired as a result of his alcoholism， he decided to stop drinking “cold turkey.\" His last alcohol intake was two days ago. He has a history of hypertension， for which he takes hydrochlorothiazide. He does not smoke or use illicit drugs.\n\n【1】On examination， his temperature is (100.4°F)， blood pressure is 175/95， heart rate is 120 beats per minute， and respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute.

However， he does not currently exhibit the more serious signs of alcohol withdrawal， such as seizure， hallucinations， or delirium.\n\n【6】· Potential complications： seizures， hallucinations (auditory， visual， or tactile)， delirium (delirium tremens or DTs).\n\n【7】●Treatment： IntravenoUss (IV) fluids， repletion of electrolytes as needed， benzodiazepines to control symptoms and prevent more serious manifestations of withdrawal (listed above).\n\n【8】ANALYSIS\n\n【9】Objectives\n\n【10】1\\. Recognize the clinical signs and symptoms of ethanol withdrawal (including seizures， hallucinations， and delirium).\n\n【11】2\\. Understand the evaluation and treatment of patients with ethanol withdrawal.\n\n【12】Considerations\n\n【13】Because ethanol abuse is prevalent in the community， emergency physicians need to be prepared to treat those who present with alcohol withdrawal. Symptoms may range from mild anxiety， nausea or vomiting， insomnia， and tremor to hallucina-tions， seizures， and delirium. Mild cases of withdrawal may be treated with oral benzodiazepines； however， patients with more serious symptomatology may require large doses of IV benzodiazepines， IV hydration， repletion of electrolytes， and hospital admission.\n\n【14】Among patients presenting to the ED for any complaint， the prevalence of alcohol-ism or inappropriate drinking is estimated to be between 8% to 40%. Some patients arrive at the ED due to a desire to stop drinking； others have already ceased their alcohol intake and require relief of the symptoms of withdrawal. In addition， alcohol-dependent patients with prolonged ED stays may be unable to maintain their usual ethanol intake and begin to manifest anxiety or tremors. Thus， emergency physi-cians will encounter many patients with alcohol withdrawal and must be prepared to treat this syndrome.\n\n【15】Because ethanol has a depressant effect on the central nervous system (CNS)， withdrawal leads to CNS excitation. Symptoms may range from mild anxiety， nausea or vomiting， insomnia， and tremor to agitation， hallucinations， seizures， and delirium. Patients often manifest signs of autonomic hyperactivity (hyperthermia， hyperten-sion， tachycardia， tachypnea， diaphoresis， hyperreflexia). Withdrawal may occur as soon as the blood alcohol level starts to fall following an abrupt reduction in or ces-sation of alcohol intake. Minor withdrawal tends to begin earlier with a peak at 24 to36 hours while major withdrawal usually occurs after 24 hours with a peak at 50 hours.\n\n【16】Alcohol withdrawal hallucinations may be auditory， visual， or tactile although auditory ones are most common. Patients with this condition have a clear senso-rium. Alcohol withdrawal seizures are tonic-clonic and may occur singly or mul-tiply. Up to one-third of these patients progress to DTs. Delirium tremens is the most severe form of alcohol withdrawal. It is characterized by fluctuating levels of consciousness， cognitive disturbances， profound confusion， and severe autonomic hyperactivity. With treatment， the mortality of DTs is 1% to 10%.\n\n【17】The differential diagnosis of alcohol withdrawal is broad and includes infections(eg， meningitis， encephalitis)， other seizure disorders (eg， epilepsy)， endocrine disor-ders (eg， thyrotoxicosis or thyroid storm)， trauma (eg， subdural hemorrhage)，meta-bolic abnormalities (eg， hypoglycemia)， psychiatric disorders (eg， schizophrenia)， drug intoxications (eg， sympathomimetics， antihistamines)， and other types of with-drawal syndromes (eg， benzodiazepines). Benzodiazepines are widely used as anxio-lytics， sleep aids， anticonvulsants， and muscle relaxants. Because benzodiazepines are also CNS depressants， withdrawal from these agents may be clinically indistin-guishable from alcohol withdrawal. A history of prolonged or high dose benzodiaz-epine use may be helpful to differentiate between the two. Abrupt discontinuance of short-acting benzodiazepines may be symptomatic after 2 to 3 days while withdrawal from long-acting agents may present up to 7 days after cessation.\n\n【18】Important historical information includes current symptomatology， usual amount of alcohol consumption， timing of last alcohol intake， comorbidities， and any other medication or other drug use. The initial evaluation of the patient should involve the assessment (and stabilization if necessary) of the ABCs. A complete set of vital signs is paramount in order to identify any autonomic hyperactivity. The patient 删除换行1 should be examined from head to toe looking for evidence of alternative etiologies for the patient symptoms (eg， signs of trauma associated with intracranial hemor-rhage， nuchal rigidity with meningitis， thyromegaly with thyrotoxicosis， etc). In addition， a thorough neurologic examination should be performed to identify any alterations in level of consciousness or mental status as well as any focal deficits.\n\n【19】Diagnostic studies are largely useful in ruling out alternative diagnoses and con-comitant medical conditions. Patients with mild alcohol withdrawal may not require any laboratory studies or imaging. Those with severe withdrawal may require a more extensive workup including any or all of the following： complete blood count， elec-trolytes， renal function tests， glucose， liver enzymes， blood gas， thyroid function studies， cardiac enzymes， urinalysis， urine drug screen， ECG， chest x-ray， computed tomography of the head， and/or lumbar puncture.\n\n【20】Ireatment\n\n【21】Treatment of alcohol withdrawal serves several purposes： symptomatic relief， calm-ing of the patient to allow an adequate evaluation， and prevention of progression of symptoms. The mainstay of treatment is benzodiazepines， most commonly chlor-diazepoxide， diazepam， and lorazepam. These medications are titrated to control the patient agitation， and very high doses may be required. Neuroleptics such as haloperidol or ziprasidone may be considered for patients who do not respond adequately to benzodiazepines. In addition， a continuous propofol infusion may be beneficial in patients with severe withdrawal who are refractory to high dose benzodiazepines. The alpha-agonist clonidine may be a useful adjunct to counteract the autonomic hyperactivity associated with alcohol withdrawal. B-Blockers may also help control tachycardia and hypertension； however， they may mask some of the earlier signs of impending DTs. Depending on the patient fluid and nutrition status， IV hydration and repletion of electrolytes (eg， potassium， magnesium， and phosphorus) may be needed. Malnourished patients should also be given thiamine and folate replacement.\n\n【22】The disposition of patients with alcohol withdrawal depends on the severity of symptoms， response to treatment， and availability of outpatient support. If the patient responds well to therapy in the ED， he/she may be discharged with an oral benzodiazepine taper， abstinence from alcohol， and participation in a rehabilitation program. However， patients who require high doses of benzodiazepines and those who have more severe symptoms or DTs must be admitted.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The most common term has been “congestive heart failure” (CHF). It has also been divided into “left-sided heart failure” and “right-sided heart failure” based on symptomatology. In the past heart failure has also been defined by how well the left ventricle either contracts or fills. If the left ventricle showed signs that it could not contract effectively it was termed systolic failure. If the left ventricle had become very stiff and could not fill adequately, it was termed diastolic failure. Refining the concept of whether it is a “contraction problem” or a “filling problem” has led to focusing on the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Based on LVEF, heart failure is currently divided into three new categories: Heart Failure with reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF), Heart Failure with preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF), and a middle level of heart failure called Heart Failure with midrange Ejection Fraction (HFmrEF) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. By refining the definition of heart failure with respect to LVEF criteria, it has provided new guidelines for management of patients with heart failure. For the purpose of this book, heart failure will be discussed in terms of HFrEF, HFmrEF, and HFpEF.\n\n【12】1.2 Definition of Heart Failure\n-------------------------------\n\n【13】The simplest definition of heart failure (HF) is the failure of the heart to pump enough blood to meet the body’s demands. Heart failure is a complex syndrome that involves the interplay between the heart, the systemic and pulmonary vasculatures, the kidneys, and the sympathetic nervous system. With HF each system is impacted. While each system attempts to provide means of correcting the problem, the interplay between systems becomes counter-productive and actually contributes to the pathophysiological process. This pathophysiological process involves a series of complex neurohormonal responses. It represents the vicious cycle of failure that can easily develop if appropriate treatment is not implemented.\n\n【14】Historically heart failure was defined by whether the left ventricle or the right ventricle failed. However, frequently over time both ventricles begin to fail producing a combined failure. Exploring the pathophysiology more closely, it has become evident that in some patients the left ventricle does not contract well during systole, and in other patients the left ventricle is stiff or noncompliant and does fill appropriately during diastole. Clinically the ability to determine how well the heart contracts can be measured by examining the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Left ventricular ejection fraction represents the percentage of blood pumped out of the left ventricle per beat. Using the LVEF as the marker of left ventricular function, the newest nomenclature for heart failure is Heart Failure with a reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF) with an LVEF less than or equal to 40% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, Heart Failure with a midrange Ejection Fraction (HFmrEF) with an LVEF between 41% and 49% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, and Heart Failure with a preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF) with a LVEF equal to or greater than 50% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 – 3 \\]</u>. When patients have HFrEF, the low LVEF implies for any given about of blood in the left ventricle at the onset of systole only 40% or less is actually ejected into the systemic circulation. For example, with HFrEF if there is 100 cc of blood in the left ventricle at the start of systole and the LVEF is only 40%, the amount ejected into the systemic circulation or the stroke volume is only 40 cc. In comparison with HFpEF, the left ventricle is noncompliant and is not filling well during diastole. Hence if the left ventricle hypothetically fills with 50 cc of blood and ejects 50% of that volume, the LVEF is 50%, but the stroke volume is only 25 cc. Hypothetically both examples illustrate a scenario where the stroke volume does not produce a sufficient cardiac output to meet the body’s demands. Given the formula for cardiac output (CO) as the stroke volume (SV) times the heart rate (HR) {CO = SV × HR}, in all three forms of HF (HFrEF, HFmrEF, and HFpEF), the stroke volume is not sufficient to produce an adequate cardiac output. By identifying the degree of failure for each patient based on LVEF, it allows clinicians to match the treatment strategy to the degree and type of failure.\n\n【15】1.3 Factors that Govern Systolic Function\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【16】There are four main factors that govern systolic function: preload , afterload , heart rate , and the contractile state of the myocardium . By definition preload is the amount of blood in the ventricle at the end of diastole just prior to systole. The preload can be measured with a pulmonary artery catheter. By measuring the pressures within a pulmonary artery the pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) \\[also called the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP)\\] can be measured. The PAWP reflects the left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP), or the pressure within the left ventricle at the end of diastole. A normal PAWP is 6–12 mmHg 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The afterload is the amount of work the heart must exert to open the aortic valve, and it is measured as the systemic vascular resistance (SVR). The normal range for the SVR is 800–1200 dynes/s/cm <sup>5 </sup> 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Heart rate also contributes to the ventricular systolic function. As the heart rate increases in response to an increase in sympathetic nervous system (SNS) stimulation, the diastolic filling time is reduced which impacts the left ventricular diastolic volume 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. If the heart rate becomes too rapid, it has the potential of reducing both the stroke volume and the cardiac output. In addition, a reduction in diastolic filling time also reduces coronary artery perfusion, since the perfusion to the myocardium itself occurs during diastole. This then can lead to a decrease in the function of the myocardium itself. The fourth factor that governs systolic function is the contractile state of the myocardium. Many factors can decrease contractility. Hypoxia, acidosis, ischemia, a prior myocardial infarction, and hypothermia all can decrease the ability of the myocardium to contract effectively. With heart failure there are significant changes in the patient’s preload, afterload, heart rate, and contractile state that individually as well as collectively reduce the heart’s ability to produce an effective cardiac output.\n\n【17】1.4 Neurohormonal Mechanisms\n----------------------------\n\n【18】Adding to the complexity of the pathophysiology of heart failure, the neurohormonal mechanisms involving the SNS and the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone (RAA) system become activated. As the SNS becomes stimulated the arterial vascular tone increases and arterial vasoconstriction is increased. The inherent goal of the SNS stimulation is to improve the blood supply to the vital organs, but at the expense of increasing systemic vascular resistance. In heart failure the increase in systemic vascular resistance contributes to the progression of HF by increasing the workload on the heart. The systemic vascular resistance is calculated as \\[(MAP-mean RAP)/CO × 80\\], where MAP is the mean arterial pressure and RAP is the right atrial pressure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Since the systemic vascular resistance represents the amount of work the heart must exert, as vasoconstriction increases the systemic vascular resistance the workload on the heart increases. The workload on the heart also increases as the heart rate increases. As the preload increases and systemic vascular resistance increases, the force of contraction can increase if the heart is healthy. But for the heart in failure, the increase in the required energy to produce a forceful contraction is limited. The rise in required workload from the increase in preload, systemic vascular resistance, and heart rate increases the myocardial workload to the point that the heart begins to fail and the cardiac output begins to decrease.\n\n【19】The decrease in cardiac output then decreases the oxygenated blood supply to vital organs. One organ that is particularly sensitive to the reduction in cardiac output is the kidney. When the renal perfusion is decreased, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decreases and the RAA system is activated. The RAA system then stimulates the release of aldosterone which leads to renal sodium and water retention. Ideally the retention of water increases the preload, with the underlying goal to increase the cardiac output. But with heart failure the increase in preload negatively impacts the heart’s ability to achieve an adequate cardiac output. As the preload becomes too great, the force of contraction decreases and the cardiac output declines. The drop in the cardiac output can be plotted on the cardiac function curve noting that as the preload or PAWP rises beyond a point, the cardiac output begins to drop 删除33：<u></u>. In addition, the RAA system stimulates the activation of angiotensin II which is a systemic vasoconstrictor. This also causes the release of vasopressin or antidiuretic hormone (ADH) from the posterior pituitary. Both angiotensin II and vasopressin increase the systemic and peripheral vascular resistance, and ADH contributes to a further increase in preload 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. As the systemic vascular resistance continues to increase, the workload on the myocardium also increases which contributes to a further reduction in the cardiac output.\n\n【20】A line graph plots C O versus P A W P. There is a concave curve on the graph that starts near the origin.\n\n【21】删除3：<u>Fig. 1.1\n\n【22】The cardiac function curve: the Frank Starling law of the heart</u>\n\n【23】While both the SNS and RAA systems strive to increase the preload in order to increase the left ventricular end diastolic volume and the subsequent stroke volume and cardiac output, their efforts become counter-productive. Ideally in terms of the Frank Starling law of the heart, by increasing the preload the goal is to achieve the ideal alignment of actin and myosin filaments within the cardiac muscle itself, in order to obtain the needed contraction for an effective cardiac output 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. However, as the preload continues to increase, actin and myosin are no longer in an ideal alignment and the cardiac output begins to decrease 删除33：<u></u>. Also in the early phase of HF, atrial and brain natriuretic peptides (ANP and BNP) are released by cardiac myocytes in response to the increase in preload and the subsequent stretch within atria and the ventricles. ANP and BNP then attempt to decrease renal sodium and water reabsorption, as well as produce dilation of the systemic blood vessels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. But as the stimulation of the SNS and RAA system continue, the natriuretic peptides fail to counteract the SNS and the RAA system, and the natriuretic peptides become degraded by the enzyme neprilysin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. After a given point, which varies for each patient, the cardiac output declines as the left ventricular end diastolic volume, preload, and PAWP increase, and a vicious cycle develops 删除33：<u></u>. As the cardiac output drops further, SNS continues to be stimulated, which further increases the systemic vascular resistance, and adds to the workload on the heart. The kidneys continue to activate the RAA system promoting more sodium to be retained, which leads to more fluid retention and the preload continues to increase. The outcome is an added reduction in the cardiac output. Since there is a resistance to the forward flow of blood into the systemic circulation from both an increase in systemic vascular resistance and a decrease in contractility, venous congestion develops in the pulmonary bed, and oxygen exchange decreases. As the hypoxia within the pulmonary circulation increases, the pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) increases. This then increases the workload on the right ventricle. However, the right ventricle is not a strong pumping chamber, and the venous congestion progresses into the right atrium and then into the general venous circulation. Clinically this results in an elevated central venous pressure (CVP), elevated jugular venous distension (JVD), and hepatomegaly. The increase in preload also takes a toll on the left ventricle. As the preload continues to increase, the left ventricle dilates. And as the systemic vascular resistance forces the left ventricle to work against higher systemic pressures, it causes the left ventricle to increase in muscle mass or hypertrophy. As the neurohormonal components continue to be stimulated, they become more counter-productive. Plotting the cardiac output on the cardiac function curve, it becomes apparent that for every unit increase in PAWP there is a further decrease in the cardiac output 删除33：<u></u>.\n\n【24】A line graph plots C O versus P A W P. There is a concave curve that starts near the origin. It has an extreme dip on the right end.\n\n【25】删除3：<u>Fig. 1.2\n\n【26】The cardiac function curve with heart failure</u>\n\n【27】While the cardiac function curve helps to illustrate the negative consequences of too high a PAWP, it is important to note that the cardiac function curve is not stagnant. Normal SNS stimulation and positive inotropic drugs can move the cardiac function curve up and to the left and improve the cardiac output. But in heart failure, hypoxia, negative inotropic drugs, ischemia, and too great a preload or systemic vascular resistance can move the cardiac function curve down and to the right. As the cardiac function curve moves down and to the right, it implies that as the preload or PAWP increases there is an actual further decrease in the cardiac output. Specifically with HF, an increase in the preload, as measured by an increase in the PAWP, decreases contractility which moves the cardiac function curve down and to the right even more. Graphically Fig. 1.3 demonstrates the more the left ventricle fails, the greater the shift in the cardiac function curve. Hence in HF for any increase in the PAWP there is a further decrease in the cardiac output 删除33：<u>通用删除1(英):<u>(from A to B in Fig. 1.3 )</u></u>.\n\n【28】A line graph plots C O versus P A W P. It has 3 concave curves. The curve at the top is the largest with a smaller curve below it labeled as A, and a slightly larger curve than A, below A, labeled as B.\n\n【29】删除3：<u>Fig. 1.3\n\n【30】Decreases in cardiac output with heart failure</u>\n\n【31】Ideally the compensatory mechanisms within the neurohormonal responses should restore the cardiac output and subsequently meet the body’s metabolic demands. However, the SNS and the RAA system continue to become counter-productive. The heart rate increases making the myocardium work harder, and as tachycardia develops it reduces diastolic filling time. The SNS stimulation also increases circulating catecholamines which may promote dysrhythmias. The increase in systemic vascular resistance continues to make the left ventricle work against higher pressures. The kidneys continue their role of trying to improve their blood supply through the RAA system. Hence the preload is increased even more, the systemic vascular resistance is increased, and the heart begins to dilate and hypertrophy. As the myocardium hypertrophies, it decreases the coronary artery perfusion and can potentiate myocardial ischemia. In addition, prolonged SNS stimulation, prolonged angiotensin II, and secretion of aldosterone produce changes in the myocardial fibers which results in negative remodeling of the myocardium. This negative remodeling, which actually changes the shape of the heart muscle itself, further reduces the cardiac output and contributes to further progression of HF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Without appropriate medical and nursing interventions, a vicious cycle ensues with chronically elevated heart rate, increase in fluid retention, and a continual downward spiraling cardiac output and decompensated HF develops. Understanding the neurohormonal responses and the complexity of the pathophysiology provides the foundation for the treatment of HF patients. Chapter 6 , discusses the treatment of HFrEF which includes beta-blockers help to curtail the SNS stimulation and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNi) and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) impact the RAA system, and diuretics and sodium-glucose transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) can begin to help to reduce fluid retention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【32】For patients who fail to respond to treatment and develop acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) or whose cardiac output has dropped dramatically, cardiogenic shock may develop. Hemodynamically cardiogenic shock is defined as a cardiac index less than 2.2 L/min/kg/m <sup>2 </sup> 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 \\]</u>. A classic symptom of cardiogenic shock is pulmonary edema. As the hydrostatic pressure within the pulmonary circulation becomes greater than the colloidal osmotic pressure, fluid leaks into the interstitial spaces and into the alveoli. If a patient is intubated or begins productive coughing, pink frothy sputum may be evident. Other clinical manifestations of cardiogenic shock are an elevated PAWP above 15 cm water pressure, profound hypotension with a systolic BP less than 90 mmHg, an elevated SVR, and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Also the vital signs will reflect both an effort to increase heart rate, but a drop in SaO <sub>2 </sub> and extreme shortness of breath will develop if the patient is not already intubated. Because of the compensatory mechanisms still trying to rescue the circulatory system, there will be a decrease in renal perfusion and hence a decrease in GFR and urinary output.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

X-ray of the chest shows a 2-cm mass in the left lower lobe of the lung, which is biopsied, revealing squamous cell carcinoma. A sample of non-neoplastic tissue from the lung biopsy is shown in the image.

In smokers, pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium lining the bronchi can undergo metaplasia and transform into stratified squamous epithelium. Stratified epithelium is defined as epithelial membrane composed of more than one cell layer. Stratified squamous epithelium is classified by the flattened shape of the cells in the surface layer. Examples of tissues with stratified squamous epithelium include the skin, mouth, anus, vagina, and esophagus. While it is wrongly believed that stratified epithelium is the result of the need for additional protection from the noxious smoke, the metaplasia actually results from genetic mutation related to the developing cancer.  \nAnswer A is incorrect. Pseudostratified columnar epithelium is the normal respiratory epithelium on the right that is undergoing metaplasia. This type of epithelium only appears stratified; however, all cells are in contact with basal lamina and only some cells reach the surface of epithelium.  \nAnswer B is incorrect. Simple squamous epithelium lines alveoli, the loops of Henle, and blood vessels. Simple epithelium indicates that the epithelial membrane is composed of a single layer of cells, which helps when diffusion is important. Under the microscope, simple squamous epithelium is characterized by a single sheet of flattened cells lying on a basal lamina. It does not play a role in this case.  \nAnswer C is incorrect. Stratified columnar epithelium is found in only a few places in the body, namely, the conjunctivae of the eye and regions of the male urethra. It is composed of a low polyhedral to cuboidal deeper layer in contact with the basal lamina along with a superficial layer of columnar cells.  \nAnswer E is incorrect. The bladder is lined by transitional epithelium, not the lung. Transitional epithelium is characterized by several layers of cuboidal cells, with the surface layer being large and dome-shaped.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Dark marks appeared after resolution of acne lesions on the chest and are not associated with any symptoms. Acne is still present but has abated in severity over the past 5 years, initially involving the face and back but persisting on the chest. Treatment with over the counter hydroquinone 2 % cream twice a day for 4 months has been ineffective.\n\n【21】Physical Examination\n--------------------\n\n【22】Skin examination revealed several scattered ill-defined hyperpigmented macules and patches localized to the chest along with 3 scattered erythematous papules 删除33：<u></u>.\n\n【23】删除3：<u>Figure 13.1\n\n【24】Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. 30 year-old African-American woman with ill-defined hyperpigmented macules and patches on the chest</u>\n\n【25】Clinical Differential Diagnosis\n-------------------------------\n\n【26】In this particular case of scattered macules and patches involving the chest, one may consider diagnoses such as pityriasis versicolor, postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) or erythema dyschromicum perstans. The former tends to present with surface scale, while the latter may have a component of erythema and a more widespread distribution. The differential diagnosis of hyperpigmentation can be vast and depends on the clinical presentation. Preceding inflammation may be subclinical in some instances, which may further complicate diagnosis. History, morphology and distribution can help narrow down potential inciting factors.\n\n【27】Histopathology\n--------------\n\n【28】Hyperpigmentation on histology can be epidermal, dermal or mixed, where an excess of melanin is present in both the epidermis and dermis 删除10：<u>(Ortonne and Passeron 2005 )</u>. Most cases of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation will show increased pigmentation in basal epidermal keratinocytes; however, there may also be a dermal component, showing melanophages. Clinically, brown and blue hyperpigmentation are caused by excessive amounts of melanin within the epidermis or dermis, respectively. Focal deposition of melanin is mainly seen in PIH, which can occur after a burn, laceration, acne or any inflammation inducing insult to the skin 删除10：<u>(Davis and Callender 2010 )</u>.\n\n【29】Diagnosis\n---------\n\n【30】Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) secondary to acne vulgaris.\n\n【31】Case Treatment\n--------------\n\n【32】As aforementioned, the patient did not note improvement with 4 months of twice a day use of over-the-counter hydroquinone 2 % cream. Hydroquinone 4 % cream twice a day to affected areas, along with daily broad spectrum sunscreen with at least sun protection factor 30 were recommended. In addition to addressing treatment of hyperpigmentation, the underlying causative condition, acne vulgaris, was also treated with benzoyl peroxide 4 % wash followed by topical clindamycin 1 % lotion every morning. Three months of this treatment regimen caused significant clinical improvement of hyperpigmentation.\n\n【33】Discussion\n----------\n\n【34】Hyperpigmentation is an umbrella term for a group of conditions that cause dark discoloration of the skin and includes melasma, PIH and medication-induced hyperpigmentation. Hyperpigmentation most commonly affects patients with Fitzpatrick skin phototypes IV-VI who are often patients of African, Asian, Hispanic, Pacific Islander, and/or Native Hawaiian backgrounds. There is no gender or age predilection. Considering dyschromia is one of the top five skin diagnoses in African-American patients, keen knowledge of pathogenesis, diagnosis and available treatment options for hyperpigmentation is of vital importance 删除10：<u>(Alexis et al. 2007 )</u>. While considered cosmetic by some standards, dyschromias, such as PIH may have lasting psychosocial effects.\n\n【35】Acne-induced PIH is a particularly common occurrence in patients of color 删除33：<u></u>. In a 2002 study that evaluated acne in skin of color, 65.3 % of African-American (N = 239), 52.7 % of Hispanic (N = 55), and 47.4 % of Asian (N = 19) patients acquired acne-induced PIH 删除10：<u>(Taylor et al. 2002 )</u>. Atopic dermatitis, a chronic inflammatory dermatosis, has a prevalence of 10.7 % in the US, with a significantly higher prevalence seen in both the African-American populations. A common sequela is PIH 删除10：<u>(Vachiramon et al. 2012 )</u>.\n\n【36】删除3：<u>Figure 13.2\n\n【37】Acne induced postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. A young African-American woman with hyperpigmented macules on the cheek as a result of mild inflammatory acne vulgaris</u>\n\n【38】The etiology of PIH has not been fully elucidated, however, it is hypothesized to involve inflammatory mediators, including prostaglandins (PGE2) and leukotrienes (LTC4 and LTD4). These mediators go on to stimulate epidermal melanocytes, causing an increase in melanin synthesis in the basal layer of the epidermis or release of melanin from labile melanocytes into the dermis. Elevation of melanin in the dermis in turn activates dermal macrophages 删除10：<u>(Desai 2014 )</u>.\n\n【39】Treatment\n---------\n\n【40】The initial approach to treating PIH begins with identifying and treating the underlying dermatosis. Once this is achieved, the resulting hyperpigmentation may then be targeted. A crucial element in the treatment of hyperpigmentation is the use of photoprotection. Use of a broad spectrum sunscreen with a sun protection factor of 30 or higher every two hours during sun-exposure will effectively prevent the worsening of hyperpigmentation 删除10：<u>(Desai 2014 )</u>. After any possible inciting causes and photoprotection are addressed, it is then reasonable to initiate topical skin lightening agents. Such agents, alone or in combination, include: hydroquinone (HQ), mequinol, azelaic acid, kojic acid, retinoids, and soy.\n\n【41】HQ is a potent inhibitor of melanin production by competitively inhibiting tyrosinase, the key regulatory enzyme in the conversion of amino acid tyrosine to melanin within melanocytes. By decreasing the production of melanin, HQ once or twice daily effectively lightens the skin. It is important to know that at higher concentrations (4 % or higher), HQ can pose a strong irritant effect (e.g. contact dermatitis). Any strength of hydroquinone can cause a paradoxical hypermelanosis termed exogeneous ochronosis with prolonged unmonitored use 删除10：<u>(Ortonne and Passeron 2005 )</u>. Although the exact amount of time required to cause ochronosis has not been delineated, clinical monitoring of patients using HQ and limiting refills can be preventative. Mequinol (4-hydroxyanisole) also functions as a competitive inhibitor of tyrosinase and is a less irritating derivative of HQ, which can be used as an alternative in patients who are particularly sensitive to HQ 删除10：<u>(Davis and Callender 2010 )</u>.\n\n【42】Azelaic acid is a naturally occurring dicarboxylic acid produced by yeast, malassezia furfur that live on the skin. Dicarboxylic acid functions to inhibit tyrosinase, thereby, reducing the production of melanin. In addition, azelaic acid, 15 or 20 % is used to treat both comedonal and inflammatory acne by decreasing the bacterial load and keratin on the skin. In fact, a randomized controlled trial performed on 52 Fitzpatrick skin types IV-VI patients who presented with facial hyperpigmentation showed a visible decrease of pigment intensity after 24 weeks of treatment with 20 % azelaic acid cream 删除10：<u>(Davis and Callender 2010 )</u>. Reported adverse effects include desquamation, pruritus, transient erythema, and irritation; all of which are usually mild and resolve within a few weeks 删除10：<u>(Alexis and Blackcloud 2013 )</u>.\n\n【43】Kojic acid, a fungal metabolite, is yet another potent inhibitor of tyrosinase that can be compounded with other lightening agents, like HQ, to increase its effectiveness at reducing hyperpigmentation. However, there is a paucity of data showing its efficacy in the treatment of PIH. Common side effects of kojic acid are contact dermatitis and increased skin sensitization, which can also lead to PIH in patients of color 删除10：<u>(Alexis and Blackcloud 2013 )</u>.\n\n【44】Functioning as derivatives of vitamin A, topical retinoids (e.g. tretinoin) are effective alone or combined with other topicals, including HQ, to treat hyperpigmentation in patients with darker complexions. Through several biologic effects that include the interference of melanogenesis and enhancement of both keratinocyte proliferation and epidermal cell turnover, tretinoin improves acne-induced PIH in patients of color. Potential adverse effects include erythema, desquamation, dryness, pruritus, and PIH.\n\n【45】Soy, formulated alone or with other agents like retinol, functions as an inhibitor of protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR-2) that are found on keratinocytes and mediate the transfer of melanosomes from melanocytes to the surrounding keratinocytes 删除10：<u>(Alexis and Blackcloud 2013 )</u>. As a result, the phagocytosis of melanosomes into keratinocytes is reduced, triggering a reversible skin lightening effect in patients with acne-induced PIH. Although soy products are well tolerated, there is a need for more large-scale clinical trials in patients with skin of color 删除10：<u>(Ortonne and Passeron 2005 ; Davis and Callender 2010 )</u>.\n\n【46】Adjunctive therapy with chemexfoliation (i.e. chemical peels) may be added once first line topical therapies, like HQ, have been initiated. Chemical peels are common, nonsurgical procedures that may aid in the reversal of various dyschromias and are safe in patients of color when used properly. Chemical peels, with a peeling agent such as glycolic acid (20–70 %), are well tolerated and work superficially by penetrating the papillary dermis and inducing epidermolysis, which causes the dispersal of basal layer melanin and increases dermal collagen synthesis. In patients with darker skin, salicylic acid peels have also been shown to improve the dyschromia seen in acne-associated PIH in addition to the concomitant acne (due to its comedolytic effect). Efficacy may be achieved with applications at 2–4 week intervals, with concentrations ranging between 20 and 30 % 删除10：<u>(Grimes 1999 )</u>. In addition, pretreatment with 4 % hydroquinone may improve results. Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) is another peeling agent used for treating dyschromias, but research data to support its use in Fitzpatrick skin types IV to VI is lacking. Regardless of the acid used, it is important to treat initially with the lowest concentration to avoid irritation, which can potentially worsen PIH or lead to new areas of dyspigmentation, hypertrophic scarring, or even keloid formation. Common side effects include burning sensation, superficial desquamation, and erythema. Likewise, the use of photoprotection is essential to prevent worsening PIH after chemical peeling.\n\n【47】Key Points\n\n【48】   PIH is a common condition that most dermatologists will face in practice.\n   Identification and treatment of the underlying cause of the PIH is the key to successfully treating this disorder.\n   Sun protection is an important adjunct to treatment of dyschromias.\n   Skin lightening agents such as hydroquinone are effective and safe when used properly.\n   Being mindful of the diagnostic and therapeutic nuances of dyschromias in patients of color will help to guide the approach to treatment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

I will now present the case of a young woman who contacted me following an opera-tion for a glioma in her brain. What follows concerns the progression of a psychosomatic psychotherapy over nearly two years， by which I was severely tested as a psychotherapist.\n\n【3】Once patients have been operated on， what happens to them?\n\n【4】Unlike classical psychoanalysis， in psychosomatics the patient and the therapist sit facing each other. I will indicate some other forms of this particular psychotherapy as I explain the therapeutic process here.\n\n【5】First meeting： the memory of words\n\n【6】Chloe phoned me to make an appointment， with a view to conduct-ing a psychoanalysis. She contacted me following a recommendation from my colleague， the neurosurgeon who had operated on her. She had obtained some information about me by consulting some web-sites， and had read one of my books. I asked her first about her cur-rent condition—she replied that she had recently had an operation for a 删除换行1 glioma， a brain tumour in the prefrontal cortices. She worked in a large library in the capital， and we arranged an appointment for October.\n\n【7】Chloe is a slender woman， around 175cm tall with dark brown hair， who fixes me with a stare that I initially think is questioning， but then suddenly strikes me as vacant during the session. This sensation of looking at someone whose gaze has disappeared can be disturbing for the psychotherapist—what has disappeared from her personality since the surgery?\n\n【8】Following her operation five months earlier， Chloe had suffered from some phonemic paraphasias， as well as epileptic fits that occurred in the evening every two to three weeks； she also has long periods of insomnia. Phonological paraphasias are very common manifestations of aphasia and have often been described in the literature. They are a qualitative problem of oral expression that affects lexical production in an aphasic syndrome. This issue is characterised by a verbal production that does not correspond to the words the speaker wants to use， and derives from a phonological similarity with the target. These mistakes are also involuntary. Three aphasic syndromes are generally described as the most liable to produce phonological paraphasias： Broca's aphasia， Wernicke's aphasia， predominantly phonemic， and conduction aphasia.\n\n【9】During the first few minutes of our interview， we reviewed the incidents connected with the consequences of her paraphasias； Chloe's speech has a foreign inflection that is a mixture of English and German-she tells me that this dates back to her operation. When I ask about her knowledge of languages， she tells me that she studied English and German， both of which she still speaks. The interview takes a chaotic course， with many silences and hesitations-she seems to be searching for her words， because if I do not ask a question or keep the conversation going， Chloe looks at me without replying. I realise that I must maintain the verbal connection， because what seems to have been damaged in the neurosurgical operation is the capacity for understand-ing long spoken sentences； her capacities have been gradually return-ing with the help of a speech therapist who has been treating her since her surgery. Chloe does not remember what is said； I adapt quickly and address her using short sentences. I come to the conclusion that these are mild paraphasic problems.\n\n【10】I silently make a note to myself to meet the neurosurgeon after one or two sessions with Chloe， in order to assess the operation and its neu-rological consequences. It is important that a psychosomatician should 删除换行1 obtain information about his patient's medical records. I make a mental note that it is not only the intonation of words， but also access to her verbal memory， as well as her working memory， that seem to have been impaired.\n\n【11】Every time I say nothing there is another silence， and when I ask her， “What are you thinking about?\"she replies， \"nothing\". Unlike the many neurotic patients in whom we quickly detect the mechanism of repression， I observe that Chloe is really not thinking about anything； there is a blank in thought， and we are dealing with a mental emptiness that has neurological rather than psychic origins.\n\n【12】I soon realise that I must gradually build with her， in the therapeutic relationship， the links between words， emotions， and thoughts—both her current and her past thoughts. We must work on recovering the semantic memory and the mental and affective representations of her past. This in an objective of therapeutic work that I must confirm after my interview with her neurosurgeon. The processes relating to psychic connections seem to have been damaged by the disappearance of some of the networks of neuronal connections.\n\n【13】Several times during the session， Chloe showed emotions that I sensed strongly in her infraverbal and unconscious communication. So that she could gradually understand the nature of the therapeutic relationship and the work that we would be doing together， I told her what I was sensing-namely some helplessness—which she confirmed to me. This was an emotion connected with her condition and her inca-pacity to mobilise quickly the rich vocabulary to which she had previ-ously been accustomed-a feeling of being paralysed. She was really in distress.\n\n【14】To be able to work therapeutically， since Chloe was unable to mobi-lise her thought to converse with me， I decided on the following thera-peutic strategy： to start asking her questions gradually， addressing all the possible associative chains (by semantic fields)： her vocation as a librarian， her curiosity about books， her university studies， her current work， her family， her friends， and so on； in short， to begin to reactivate， build， and strengthen a network of associative chains (thereby also rein-forcing the synaptic connections). Hanna Damasio and her colleagues at the University of Iowa have demonstrated that tasks in which sub-jects have to name people， animals， or tools activate different regions of the temporal cortex. This helps to explain why lesions that only affect a relatively small area of the temporal lobe sometimes entail the loss of 删除换行1 words that refer to a category of particular objects. Ojemann’s research in electrophysiology has shown that language is organised by semantic categories rather than words. The therapeutic strategy that I have used corresponds to the above-mentioned neuroscientific works 删除10：<u>(Purves et al.， 2004， p.599)</u>.\n\n【15】She read books， possibly fairy tales， when she was very young； these books were close at hand on a small shelf beside her desk in her class-room at school. She opened and read them enthusiastically， and so she always got zero in her dictation (emergence of humour-self-irony)， which we laughed about together. Her mother also brought her books to read from the library at the secondary school where she taught.\n\n【16】She naturally goes on to talk about her mother， and I sense deeply the hostility she feels towards her and point this out to her. She agrees with this and tells me that her mother has always shown aggression towards her and her two sisters； in her opinion， she has a psychiatric condition. I remain pensive；she adds that she cannot indicate to me any kind of diagnosis. I answer that it may be a question of character traits that have been interpreted as psychiatric problems； she then adds that her mother was also committed but she does not know the reasons why.\n\n【17】When she was seventeen years old， she left her family to go to Paris and pursue studies initially in literature， and then in librarianship. She is now thirty-eight years old and lives with a young man， Andre， who is also a colleague. When she talks about Andre， I feel a certain hostility in her voice， with an intensity that is akin to her relationship with her mother. She is hostile towards him because he has helped her through-out recent months， and in a way this has made her annoyed with him. This shows her narcissistic dimension： “I can solve this on my own.\"She keeps anyone who wants to help her at a distance. I question what effect this will have in the therapeutic relationship， and make a note of this observation.\n\n【18】She is having difficulties with Andre， and cannot see what her imme-diate and future destiny in the library will be； how is she going to be able to manage when dealing with all her colleagues? While she does not look handicapped， she is trying， as I note during our meetings， very slowly to recover her previous mental and verbal capacities. I tell her about my clinical experience with patients； it takes between nine and eighteen months for new synaptic connections to develop. She con-firms to me that the neuropsychologist and the speech therapist have given her a horizon of around two years. She tells me just before the end 删除换行1 of one of our meetings that she will be having chemotherapy in three months' time and that she may become dependent on social services. She does not communicate to me any anxious emotions connected with her anticipation of the treatment.\n\n【19】She had not paid me at the end of the first session， although I had suggested a much lower fee than is usual for a psychotherapist； we had made a further appointment and I preferred to be patient because I did not actually know very many facts about her life and， above all， her psychic functioning following the operation. Chloe needed help， and the payment did not seem important to me.\n\n【20】In our relationship， Chloe sometimes appeared to me very robotic， while at times also very human in her desire to recover her verbal capacities， which led me to wonder： how can we help a human being to recover his portion of humanity? In this respect I am thinking of the painstaking therapeutic work of my neuropsychologist colleagues， who deal with brain-damaged patients all day long. The lack of emo-tional tone in Chloe's language makes me wonder， and I think about the normal tonal emotional components， described as prosodic elements， which give additional meaning to verbal communication. These defi-ciencies， which are called aprosodies， are associated with lesions in the cortical regions of the right hemisphere， which correspond to Broca and Wernicke regions in the left hemisphere. However， I form the hypoth-esis that， in Chloe's case， the absence of affect has a psychic origin.\n\n【21】I continue to explore the neuronal and psychic deficiencies caused by the operation： Chloe explains to me that when she reads a book (since I was asking her what books she had recently read)， she remembers the atmosphere and the climate of the book， but not the characters and what they say to each other. This confirms that the right hemisphere is functioning well. I will return to her difficulties later on in this chapter.\n\n【22】From our early meetings， I remember the conflictual relationship with her mother， an absent father， dominated by the mother， and a dis-united parental couple. She also has a younger sister， who， at the time of Chloe's operation， broke away violently from her family by leaving them to live with her child on a boat in a port in Brittany. She had not yet spoken to me about her younger sister， but this relationship seemed important.\n\n【23】I leave Chloe with many questions in my mind， because it seems that by not paying me， she has managed to create a conflictual situation that replicates her relationship with her mother； I think this 删除换行1 repetition of a psychodynamic situation is a favourable sign in regards to the prognosis of her psychotherapy.\n\n【24】Meeting： continuing with the anamnesis\n\n【25】Chloe gives me a different impression today， and we talk in a friendly and empathetic way from the beginning of the session. She tells me that she had been very tired in the previous session-I must recognise that it was the same for me， but I do not tell her this. Her tiredness is often caused by her nocturnal epileptic fits； she had had an epileptic fit the previous Saturday， and therefore had felt very tired in our ses-sion on the Monday. We continue the session by addressing， according to my therapeutic choice， a great many problems in her daily life and in her past. I also ask her about her dreams in order to ascertain more about the quality of her mental life； she tells me that she has not had any dreams since last year， but that before then her dreams were filled with anxiety. She remembered from her previous dreams some disturb-ing images of her teeth being rotten and falling out. We have not yet done any associative work on her dreams， but I think these date from the period before the glioma was discovered and the manifestations of alarm in the somatic bodv.\n\n【26】It all began one year earlier； she collapsed after an epileptic fit that resulted in a coma. She returned to work three months later， and her glioma was operated on at the end of the first quarter of the following year.\n\n【27】She talks again about her younger sister， Catherine， who has a boat on which she is currently living with her young daughter. She recently quarrelled with Catherine， because Catherine compared the destinies of the three daughters in the family； for Catherine， the three sisters have had an identical destiny， coloured by their mother's violence. Chloe does not have the same experience， and disagrees with Catherine's opinion because she thinks that she has suffered more than her two sisters have from their mother's violence. She explains to me that Catherine is a naval engineer and that she can easily gain access to boats. Catherine， who is going through a crisis with a family break-up， has written at great length (via e-mail) to many members of the extended family to reveal that their mother had been extremely violent towards her and her sisters throughout their childhood and adoles-cence. Since sending these emails， Catherine has been feeling uneasy 删除换行1 and wishes to take back what she has done. Meanwhile Chloe's father has got back in touch-for Chloe， her father is “a stranger with odd behaviour\"， always distant， but nice. He apologised to her for hav-ing been silent for many years. He also apologised to Catherine and Sylvie， the youngest sister. There is a three-year gap between Sylvie and Chloe； Sylvie is an engineer， married， and the mother of a fam-ily. During the session， she likens her father’s attitude to that of the French during the war， who watched trains going past， full of Jews being deported. This comment surprises me-why such an associa-tion? Chloe is not Jewish， but she reveals at this point her commitment to anarchism， united behind people “of no fixed abode\" and all the causes that deserve her attention as a campaigner. Her opposition to her mother has been translated by this political engagement； she takes issue with society in its very foundations.\n\n【28】Chloe begins to reflect on her current situation and wonders why she has taken so many years to reflect on the dramatic problems in her life. I tell her that it is often after the age of thirty， or following a physical illness， that people start to reflect on their destiny， going back over their past to give meaning to their lives.\n\n【29】Since meeting her boyfriend， Andre， in the town where her parents live， he recently pointed out to her that she spoke to him harshly. Chloe tells me that she has never noticed this and that， for our “relationship\"， we do not know each other well enough for her to attack me. She has therefore integrated， from her early childhood， the violent atmosphere in which she has lived and grown up. Brain tumours are sometimes accompanied by a manifestation of aggressive impulses； instead， Chloe's words reveal， through her parental conflicts， the masochistic dimension of her personality： her mother used to beat her.\n\n【30】This helps to explain her escape into drugs. From as early as twelve years old， she began to smoke marijuana and drink alcohol with one of her girl-friends， and this continued until she met Andre. She gave up alcohol at the age of twenty-four， and continued to smoke marijuana occasionally； she also smokes cigarettes in large quantities.\n\n【31】I wonder very much how it will be possible to discover what effect this addiction has had on her capacity for concentration and attention， as well as on her mnemic capacities.\n\n【32】As if in response to my unconscious musings， Chloe tells me that， since the operation， her memory has been more auditory and no longer visual. She remembers what she hears， but in a limited way， and she 删除换行1 does not remember what she reads in books； she makes notes and，once she has read them， she no longer knows which part of the book she has made them in. She cannot watch a film because she does not understand the dialogue between the characters； she also finds it difficult to follow their actions. She has brought me a book about the brain 删除10：<u>(Doidge， 2007)</u>， and asks me to read all the passages that she has underlined. This has taken considerable effort on her part.\n\n【33】She goes back over her past as a young girl and tells me that， as children， she and her sister Catherine were very gifted， achieving excep-tionally high marks at school， until the baccalaureate； it is also true that many subjects did not interest them. By contrast， it was not the same with Sylvie， who was subjected to fierce attacks from her mother， who required her to have excellent marks like her two elder sisters.\n\n【34】We end the session， which I think has been excellent， by discussing the payment for the first of our sessions. She tells me that a friend had told her that no fee was charged for the first session with a psychoana-lyst. I then adhere to the usual analytic practice to avoid unsettling her； these are sixty-minute psychosomatic psychotherapy sessions rather than a traditional psychoanalytic treatment.2 I prefer to continue our work rather than disturb it with problems of technique and therapeu-tic strategy； one day， perhaps it will be possible to explain all this， or perhaps never. She pays me by writing a cheque， and I observe that she writes this without making any mistakes with either the amount or the date， which demonstrates that her motor capacities and access to the memory of written words are only slightly impaired.\n\n【35】Meeting with the neurosurgeon\n\n【36】My colleague from the neurosurgery department greets me warmly and kindly.

He  删除换行1 has never experienced such pain and denies any urinary or bowel symptoms. His comorbidities include hypertension, diabetes mellitus and chronic obstructive airway disease. He is a  删除换行1 lifelong smoker of 20 cigarettes per day and drinks 30–40 units of alcohol per week.\n\n【3】Examination\n\n【4】His temperature is 35.9°C, pulse is 115, blood pressure is 89/48, respiratory rate is 24 and oxygen saturation is 94% on room air. Abdominal examination reveals a distended abdomen,  删除换行1 which is diffusely tender and a pulsatile mass in the upper half.\n\n【5】Questions\n\n【6】1. What is the diagnosis?\n\n【7】2. What investigations are appropriate?\n\n【8】3. What is permissive hypotension?\n\n【9】4. How would you manage this patient?\n\n【10】DISCUSSION\n\n【11】This patient has an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), which is defined as a dilatation of  删除换行1 an artery to more than 50% of its normal diameter. This classically presents with a triad of  删除换行1 abdominal pain, pulsatile abdominal mass and hypotension. However, it should be ruled  删除换行1 out in all over-65-year-old patients with abdominal pain. Do not be lured into a diagnosis of  删除换行1 renal colic in an older patient, without definitive imaging to rule out an AAA rupture.\n\n【12】The normal diameter of the infrarenal aorta is 2 cm, and therefore, an aneurysm will measure  删除换行1 >3 cm. The commonest aetiology is atherosclerosis, which causes degeneration of the tunica  删除换行1 media layer of the vessel. It is much more common in males than females. The biggest risk  删除换行1 factor is smoking; other factors include hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, family history and older age (>60). The risk of rupture increases with enlarging diameter due to Laplace’s law, which describes an increase in vessel wall tension with an increase  删除换行1 in diameter (wall tension = pressure × diameter).\n\n【13】The examination findings are classically a pulsatile, expansile mass. Ensure to palpate above  删除换行1 the umbilicus but below the xiphisternum as the aorta bifurcates at the level of the umbilicus.\n\n【14】Point-of-care ultrasound is now used routinely in most Emergency Departments to confirm the  删除换行1 presence or absence of an aortic aneurysm. It is, however, limited in that it cannot reliably rule  删除换行1 out a leak. It is also limited in the setting of obesity or overlying bowel gas, which may make  删除换行1 significant portions of the aorta invisible. The gold standard imaging modality is a contrast  删除换行1 enhanced CT scan of the aorta, which has a sensitivity of almost 100% and can help rule out  删除换行1 other causes of abdominal pain if the diagnosis is uncertain. CT scanning can demonstrate  删除换行1 impending rupture, contained leakage or frank rupture of the AAA.\n\n【15】Investigations should not delay emergency treatment. Place the patient in the resuscitation  删除换行1 room, and place at least 2 14G cannulae. Take blood for full bood count, renal function and  删除换行1 clotting, and cross-match at least 6 units of blood.\n\n【16】Consider activating the major transfusion protocol if the systolic BP is <90 mmHg or heart  删除换行1 rate >110 bpm. This will speed up the laboratory’s release of packed red cell, fresh frozen  删除换行1 plasma, cryoprecipitate and platelets. Prepare to place a urinary catheter, arterial lines and  删除换行1 central venous catheters should there be time.\n\n【17】Fluid-resuscitate the patient and consider using packed red cells as a first-line agent. Be careful  删除换行1 not to raise the blood pressure too far as this may exacerbate a leak. The concept of permissive hypotension avoids aggressive fluid resuscitation, as a higher blood pressure will result  删除换行1 in more bleeding. The aim should be for the lowest systolic blood pressure while maintaining  删除换行1 vital organ perfusion. This is usually around 90 mmHg systolic. Pain control with intravenous  删除换行1 morphine will also reduce wall tension and cardiac contraction.\n\n【18】A ruptured AAA has a 100% mortality unless immediately repaired. It requires immediate  删除换行1 referral to a vascular surgeon and repair, either by open surgery or endovascular aneurysm  删除换行1 repair (EVAR). EVAR involves femoral artery catheterisation and stent insertion.\n\n【19】Incidental or asymptomatic AAAs discovered in the Emergency Department also warrant  删除换行1 referral to a vascular surgeon. Indications for repair include a male with an AAA >5.5 cm or  删除换行1 female with an AAA >5 cm or rapid growth of more than 1 cm/year. Asymptomatic AAAs  删除换行1 measuring 2–5.5 cm requires regular ultrasonography and vascular surgery outpatient input.\nCase 65: A 68-year-old man with loin to groin pain\n\n【20】Key Points\n\n【21】• A ruptured AAA is a surgical emergency with 100% mortality if not immediately  删除换行1 repaired. It classically presents with abdominal pain, pulsatile abdominal mass and  删除换行1 hypotension.\n\n【22】• It should be ruled out in all patients over 65 years of age presenting with abdominal, loin or groin pain, especially if they have risk factors including smoking, hypertension, COPD or peripheral vascular disease.\n\n【23】• Point-of-care ultrasonography is a rapid and non-invasive investigation that can be  删除换行1 used in unstable and stable patients.\n\n【24】• Treatment involves expedient management to a vascular surgeon who will decide  删除换行1 on open surgery or EVAR.删除9：<u>http://taylorandfrancis.com231</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Other general advice includes minimizing alcohol intake, avoiding smoking and ensuring regular intercourse (preferably 2–3 times per week). The woman should 删除换行1 aim to reduce weight as this commonly induces ovulation in high-BMI women with PCOS.\n\n【29】Treatment of anovulation\n\n【30】Clomifene citrate is the main treatment to induce ovulation. The woman should be given 删除换行1 50 mg to take on day 2–6 of the menstrual cycle, with day 21 progesterone checked to 删除换行1 confirm ovulation. If ovulation occurs, then the clomifene is continued for up to six cycles 删除换行1 unless pregnancy occurs.

Other variants of the syndrome include 46，X (with abnor-mal X)， 45，XO/46，XX mosaics and 45，XO/46，XY mosaics. Although this is 删除换行1 2331 Turner syndrome 删除换行1 the single most common chromosomal disorder， >95% of the foetuses are aborted， which results in an incidence of ~1 in 4000 newborns. Women with a 45，X/46，XX karyotype and a preponderance of 46，XX cells may have all the findings of the disorder.\n\n【38】Loss of SRY on the short arm of the Y chromosome (e.g. 46，X，del(Yp)) encoding a testis-determining factor， also leads to the phenotype of Turner syndrome， even without a 45，X cell population.\n\n【39】Is there a correlation between karyotype and phenotype?\n\n【40】There are some correlations between karyotype and phenotype， but note that phenotypic predictions for a given patient that are based on karyotype may not be reliable (e.g. women with a 45，X karyotype have conceived).\n\n【41】● Growth failure\n\n【42】●Loss of interstitial or terminal long-arm material of the X chromosome(Xq) can result in short stature and primary or secondary ovarian failure.\n\n【43】●Deletions distal to Xq21 appear to have no effect on stature.删除31：<u>●</u>\nLoss of the short arm (Xp) results in the full phenotype.\n\n【44】●Very distal Xp deletions are compatible with， but do not ensure， normal ovarian function. Loss of this region usually confers short stature and the typical skeletal changes， in part as a result of haploinsufficiency of the short stature-homeobox (SHOX) gene， located in the pseudoauto-somal region of Y and Xp. (SHOX is probably not the only gene that determines skeletal features.\n\n【45】Aneuploidy itself may contribute to growth failure.\n\n【46】Women with mosaicism for 45，X/46，XX are marginally taller than other women with Turner syndrome.\n\n【47】Neurocognitive defects\n\n【48】Loss of a region at Xp22.3 appears to be associated with the neurocogni-tive problems.\n\n【49】● The presence of a ring or marker chromosome confers an increased risk of mental retardation and atypical phenotypic features.\n\n【50】●Lymphoedema\n\n【51】●A region on Xp11.4 has been postulated to be important for the develop-ment of lymphoedema.\n\n【52】Infants with a 45，X karyotype are the most likely to have congenital lymphoedema.\n\n【53】Reproductive organs\n\n【54】A karyotype of 45，X/46，XX or 45，X/47，XXX is most likely to be associ-ated with spontaneous menarche and fertility.\n\n【55】Girls with mosaicism for a cell population with a Y chromosome are at increased risk for gonadoblastoma (risk， 7-30%) in their streak gonads.\n\n【56】Hypothyroidism and inflammatory bowel disease\n\n【57】●The presence of an isochromosome Xq suggests an increased risk for hypothyroidism and inflammatory bowel disease.\n\n【58】What do you know about Lyon's hypothesis?\n\n【59】In 1961， geneticist Mary Lyon outlined that only one of the X chromo-somes is genetically active， the other being inactive. The inactivation of either the maternal or paternal X chromosome occurs at random among all the cells of the blastocyst around the 16th day of embryonic life， and inactivation of the same X chromosome persists in all cells derived from each precursor cell.\n\n【60】More recent studies， however， have shown that many genes escape X chromosome inactivation and that both X chromosomes are important for normal growth， as evidenced by severe abnormalities in Turner syndrome with a monosomy of X chromosome. It is now believed that a gene that maps to Xq13 serves as a master switch which is critical for 'switching-off'most of the genes on the active chromosome 13. This gene is known as X-inactive-specific transcript gene (XIST).\n\n【61】Henry H Turner 通用删除7(英):<u>(1892-1970)</u>， an American endocrinologist， described this condition in 1938.\n\n【62】Mary Lyon 删除10：<u>(b. 1925)</u>， geneticist who worked for the Medical Research Council in Oxford.\n\n【63】There are several support groups for patients with Turner syndrome and their families.\n\n【64】Turner Syndrome Society of UK is such a support group； 12 Irving Quadrant， Hardgate， Clydebank G81 6AZ， UK； telephone +44通用删除7(英):<u>(0)</u>1389-380385； fax +44通用删除7(英):<u>(0)</u>1389-380384； e-mail Turner.Syndrome@tss.org.uk； or see 删除换行1 删除9：<u>www.tss.org.uk/contact.html.</u> It provides： 删除换行1 free growth charts for patients with Turner syndrome 删除换行1 ppublications at cost 删除10：<u>(e.g. Reiser PA， Underwood LE.

Stroke refers to an acquired focal neurological deficit caused by an acute vascular event. The neurological deficit persists beyond  删除换行1 24 hours, in contrast to a transient ischaemic attack (TIA), where symptoms resolve before  删除换行1 24 hours, although the distinction is now blurred with the advent of thrombolysis. The term  删除换行1 cerebrovascular accident is sometimes used synonymously with stroke, but many dislike the  删除换行1 connotations of inevitability it implies, in conflict with the treatable nature of the predisposing factors and, to an extent, the acute event itself.\nStrokes are broadly categorised into ischaemic and haemorrhagic types, with the majority being ischaemic. The pathophysiology in a haemorrhagic stroke is rupture of a blood  删除换行1 vessel causing extravasation of blood into the brain substance with tissue damage and  删除换行1 disruption of neuronal connections. The resulting haematoma also compresses surrounding normal tissue.\nIn most ischaemic strokes, there is thromboembolic occlusion of vessels due to underlying  删除换行1 atherosclerosis of the aortic arch and carotid arteries.

This practice is one of the oldest treatment modalities in dermatology, dating back to the ancient Egyptians who used natural light in combination with herbal extracts to treat skin disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Phototherapy continues to be a highly preferred treatment by dermatologists 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The most commonly utilized phototherapy is ultraviolet B (UVB) phototherapy. There are two types of UVB. Broadband UVB (BB-UVB) was the first to be developed in the early 1900s and emits wavelengths of light between 290 and 313 nm. Narrowband UVB (NB-UVB), which emits wavelengths between 308 and 313 nm, was developed in the late 1980s and became standard of care for psoriasis after studies demonstrated that psoriasis is more responsive to wavelengths of around 312 nm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】For psoriasis, phototherapy is indicated for patients whose disease does not adequately respond to topical medications or those who have generalized involvement that is not amenable to topical treatment alone 删除33：<u></u>. The patient must also be available to commit time and effort and present to the office 2 to 3 times per week for at least 3 months. Given that psoriasis is a chronic dermatologic condition, patients often need to continue phototherapy treatments long-term as maintenance, which are typically once or twice weekly sessions. It is therefore important to consider the patient’s schedule, location, mode of transportation, overall convenience, and other logistics before choosing phototherapy as a treatment option. Furthermore, the issue of increasing costs of phototherapy treatments and decreasing reimbursement rates from insurance companies should also be considered 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Phototherapy is most commonly administered in the office setting in stand-up light booths 删除33：<u></u>. The starting dose of UV light is determined by the individual patient’s minimal erythema dose (MED) or Fitzpatrick skin type . MED is defined as the lowest dose of light that turns the skin erythematous or pink. In a busy phototherapy practice with a high volume of patients, formal MED testing can be cumbersome, labor intensive, and time consuming. Therefore, it may be more convenient to determine the starting dose from the patient’s skin type. Subsequent dosing is then increased as tolerated . It is important for the patient not to miss more than 1 week of treatment, as subsequent dosing should not be increased if the patient misses more than 7 days of treatment . The face and genitals should be covered and protected from the UV irradiation unless there is significant disease present in these areas. Typically, the face is wrapped with a towel. If the face needs to be treated and is exposed, proper eye goggles should be worn or the eyes should be closed. Male genitals are shielded with a towel or cone. The typical flow of a phototherapy treatment session at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Phototherapy Unit is outlined in Fig. 1.3 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.

Since the patient is skin type II, he should be started at a dose of 220 mJ/cm <sup>2 </sup> of NB-UVB (or 20 mJ/cm <sup>2 </sup> BB-UVB) and the dose should be increased by 15–75 mJ/cm <sup>2 </sup> (or 10–50 mJ/cm <sup>2 </sup> for BB-UVB) for subsequent sessions. Prior to each phototherapy session, in order to accurately determine the subsequent dose, the patient should be asked about any symptoms consistent with the side effect of burning, including skin pain, itching, or tightness. The skin should also be examined carefully for erythema, peeling, or blistering, in addition to assessment of disease improvement.\n\n【29】The patient can continue to use topical corticosteroids and topical calcipotriene at home, but the application of any topical medications or emollients should be avoided immediately prior to phototherapy treatment sessions as the penetrance of UV light can be altered by the presence of topical substances on the skin. Furthermore, topical calcipotriene, topical retinoids, and other non-steroid topical medications can irritate the skin if burned during phototherapy, so caution is advised . It is also very important to discuss with the patient that it can take several weeks to see the results of phototherapy and maximum effectiveness will not be observed until at least 12 weeks or more after the treatment is initiated. This type of expectation management is important so that the patient is not discouraged by the potential slow onset of action of phototherapy.\n\n【30】The summary of recommendations for UVB phototherapy for psoriasis according to the American Academy of Dermatology is shown in Table 1.7 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\nTable 1.7 删除换行 Summary of recommendations for UVB phototherapy for psoriasis from the American Academy of Dermatology, adapted from Menter et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>\n\n| Indication | Generalized psoriasis (including guttate) unresponsive to topicals |\n| --- | --- |\n| Dosing | Dosing |\n| BB-UVB | Initial dosing according to skin type (20–60 mJ/cm 2 ) or MED (50% of MED)Subsequent dosage increase by 5–30 mJ/cm 2 or ≤25% of initial MEDTreatment 3–5×/week\\ Advise use of protective goggles and genital shields during treatment |\n| NB-UVB | Initial dosing according to skin type (130–400 mJ/cm 2 ) or MED (50% of MED)Subsequent dosage increase by 15–65 mJ/cm 2 or ≤10% of initial MEDTreatment 3–5×/week\\ Advise use of protective goggles and genital shields during treatment |\n| Duration of treatment | Duration of treatment |\n| BB-UVB | Initial improvement often occurs within 4 weeks of therapySingle course is 20–25 treatmentsMaintenance therapy may prolong remission |\n| NB-UVB | Response observed at 8–10 treatmentsSingle course is 15–20 treatmentsMaintenance therapy may prolong remission |\n| Short-term results (clearance) | Short-term results (clearance) |\n| BB-UVB | Average of 20–25 treatments to induce clearance |\n| NB-UVB | More effective than BB-UVB, clearance within 2 weeks may be seenAverage of 15–20 treatments to achieve clearance |\n| Long-term results (remission) | Long-term results (remission) |\n| BB-UVB | Remission rate of 5% after 1 year |\n| NB-UVB | Remission rate of 38% after 1 year |\n| Contraindications | Patients with known lupus erythematosus or xeroderma pigmentosum |\n| Caution should be exercised in | Patients with skin types I and II who tend to burn easilyHistory of arsenic intake or previous treatment with ionizing radiation therapyHistory of melanoma or multiple nonmelanoma skin cancersAny medical condition that is severe enough that patient cannot tolerate heat or prolonged standing in light box |\n| Toxicity | Toxicity |\n| Acute | ErythemaPruritusBurning |\n| Long term | PhotoagingLentiginesTelangiectasiasTheoretical risk of photocarcinogenesis |\n| Drug interactions | Cautious use with other photosensitizing medicationsWhen used in conjunction with systemic retinoids, dose of both retinoids and UVB may need to be lowered |\n| Baseline monitoring | Full body skin check before initiation of therapy |\n| Ongoing monitoring | Regular full skin examination to monitor signs of photoaging, pigmentation, and cutaneous malignancies |\n| Pregnancy | Generally considered safe (expert opinion) |\n| Nursing | Generally considered safe (expert opinion) |\n| Pediatric use | No adequate study; may be used with caution in individuals aged <18 years |\n| Psoriatic arthritis | No studies |", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The intern on duty recalls learning about a drug indicated for acromegaly that may also reduce the secretion of pancreatic fluids and possibly decrease the patient’s pain. The drug works by mimicking the levels of which hormone?\n删除个例：<u>> Reproduced, with permission, from USMLERx.com.</u>\n> (A) Cholecystokinin\n\n【1】> (B) Gastrin\n\n【2】> (C) Secretin\n\n【3】> (D) Somatostatin\n\n【4】> (E) Vasoactive intestinal peptide\n\n【5】 Answer: The correct answer is D . This patient’s symptoms and pancreatic calcifications on the CT scan are consistent with chronic pancreatitis. The intern is thinking about octreotide, a somatostatin analog used to treat acromegaly. Among its various actions, somatostatin is a potent inhibitor of growth hormone secretion; it also suppresses the release of a number of digestive hormones, such as gastrin, cholecystokinin, secretin, and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). It also decreases the secretion of pancreatic fluids. By inhibiting the secretion of pancreatic fluids, octreotide may be able to alleviate this patient’s chronic abdominal pain.  \nAnswer A is incorrect . Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a hormone synthesized by duodenal I cells. Once chyme enters the duodenum, CCK is secreted to decrease gastric acid secretion and to slow the release of chyme into the duodenum. CCK stimulates the release of pancreatic digestive enzymes and induces gallbladder contraction. CCK is not indicated for the treatment of acromegaly, and no analogs have been created.  \nAnswer B is incorrect . Gastrin is a hormone released by stomach G cells in response to stomach distention, vagal stimulation, and proteins. Through the actions of gastrin on parietal cells, the end result of gastrin release is increased acid secretion. Gastrin also causes chief cells to release pepsinogen for breakdown of proteins. Gastrin is not indicated for the treatment of acromegaly and does not have a role in exocrine pancreas function.  \nAnswer C is incorrect . Secretin is a hormone produced by duodenal S cells and secreted in response to increased duodenal fatty acids and acidity. It maintains duodenal pH by stimulating bicarbonate secretion by the pancreas, thus neutralizing gastric acid. It is not indicated for the treatment of acromegaly and does not control pancreatic enzyme secretion.  \nAnswer E is incorrect . VIP is a hormone produced in the intestines and pancreas. In the intestines VIP induces smooth muscle relaxation, whereas in the pancreas it stimulates pancreatic bicarbonate secretion. VIP is not indicated for the treatment of acromegaly.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

For the past 2 months she has felt run down. She says that she doesn’t feel like participating in activities that she previously enjoyed, such as her weekly softball games. She has not been sleeping well and has not had much of an appetite. On questioning, she admits to feeling “down in the dumps” most of the time and has found herself crying frequently. She has never gone through anything like this before. She denies any thoughts of wanting to hurt herself or anyone else. She denies any symptoms now or previously of mania. She also denies any visual/auditory hallucinations, paranoia, delusions, or other psychotic symptoms. Other than becoming tearful during her interview, her physical examination is normal. Her blood tests, including a complete blood count and thyroid function, are normal. A serum pregnancy test is negative. You diagnose her as having a major depression and, along with referring her for counseling, start her on fluoxetine.\n\n【2】 What is the mechanism of action of fluoxetine?\n\n【3】 What are the common side effects of fluoxetine?\n\n【4】ANSWERS TO CASE 15:\n\n【5】Antidepressant Agents\n\n【6】Summary: A 30-year-old woman with major depression is prescribed fluoxetine.\n\n【7】 Mechanism of action of fluoxetine: Inhibition of the reuptake of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) at the prejunctional nerve terminal.\n\n【8】 Common side effects: Headache, nausea, agitation, insomnia, and sexual disturbances (loss of libido and erectile dysfunction).\n\n【9】#### CLINICAL CORRELATION\n\n【10】Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most frequently prescribed antidepressant medications. They act by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin by the prejunctional nerve terminal, allowing more serotonin to interact with post-junctional neurons in the central nervous system (CNS). This is thought to mediate their therapeutic effect. They have been highly effective in the treatment of major depressive disorders and have an excellent safety profile. Unlike tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), which have multiple severe and potentially fatal effects in an overdose, SSRIs have relatively few severe toxicities and a very low potential for fatality in an overdose. SSRIs do have several side effects of clinical significance. They often cause headache and gastrointestinal (GI) side effects such as nausea. In some cases, agitation, anxiety, and insomnia can be exacerbated. Many of these SSRI side effects tend to be temporary and can often be improved with dose reduction. Another common side effect of SSRIs is sexual disturbance. Decreased libido and erectile dysfunction occur frequently and do not generally spontaneously resolve while continuing SSRI therapy, often leading to reduced patient compliance. When diagnosing and treating depression, it is imperative to distinguish between unipolar versus bipolar depression. Agents used for unipolar depression (which major depression fits under) can cause an exacerbation of manic symptoms if used alone for major depression.\n\n【11】APPROACH TO:\n\n【12】Pharmacology of Antidepressant Drugs\n\n【13】#### OBJECTIVES\n\n【14】1\\.

Other conditions for which certain antidepressant agents are used include panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), bipolar affective disorder, chronic pain, and enuresis.\n\n【23】SSRIs are the most extensively prescribed antidepressant agents because, unlike tricyclic agents, they produce less sedation, have fewer antimuscarinic effects, and are safer in an overdose. Nevertheless, they may cause sexual disturbances, GI dysfunction, headache, and stimulation (insomnia, tremor, and anxiety).\n\n【24】TCAs may cause sedation, tremor, insomnia, blurred vision, constipation, urinary hesitancy, weight gain, and sexual disturbances. The MAOIs may cause weight gain, sexual disturbances, and sleep disturbances. Bupropion is contraindicated in patients with seizure disorders .\n删除4：<u>Table 15–1 • ANTIDEPRESSANT AGENTS</u>\n\n【25】Drug interactions of TCAs include additive sedative effects with other sedatives, particularly alcohol. MAOIs, by increasing catecholamine stores, sensitize patients to indirectly acting sympathomimetic agents, including tyramine that is contained in many fermented foodstuffs (red wine or aged cheese). Together MAOIs and sympathomimetics agents can result in a severe and sometimes fatal hypertensive episode. MAOIs and SSRIs can interact to cause a potentially lethal serotonin syndrome that includes tremor, hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, and cardiovascular collapse. All antidepressant agents now carry a “black-box warning” of an increased risk of suicidality, especially when used in children and adolescents.\n\n【26】##### Structure\n\n【27】TCAs have a three-ring nucleus similar to that of the antipsychotic phenothiazine agents. The MAOIs are subclassified as hydrazides (phenelzine) or nonhydrazides (tranylcypromine).\n\n【28】##### Mechanism of Action\n\n【29】The therapeutic activity of most of the available therapeutic antidepressant agents is due, at least in part, to their actions on norepinephrine and serotonin.\n\n【30】As the name implies, SSRIs selectively block the prejunctional neuronal uptake transporters in the CNS that terminate serotonin neurotransmission, thus allowing increased activity at serotonin receptors. SNRIs block the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine.\n\n【31】The TCAs also block the prejunctional neuronal uptake transporters in the CNS that terminate norepinephrine and serotonin neurotransmission, thus allowing increased activity at their respective receptors. Amoxapine also blocks dopamine receptors.\n\n【32】The atypical agents have a variety of pharmacodynamic effects. Some act similar to the TCAs, whereas others act as inhibitors at certain subtypes of the serotonin receptor (trazodone, mirtazapine, nefazodone). Mirtazapine also blocks the prejunctional α <sub>2 </sub> \\-adrenoceptor to enhance serotonin and norepinephrine neurotransmission.\n\n【33】The MAOIs essentially irreversibly bind to and inhibit the activity of monoamine oxidase (A and B forms). New enzyme must be synthesized to restore activity. As a result of their actions, both drugs prevent prejunctional metabolism of norepinephrine and serotonin, thus allowing more to accumulate and to be released on nerve stimulation.\n\n【34】The neurochemical and biochemical actions described for the antidepressant agents occur soon after their administration. However, the therapeutic effect of these drugs may not be apparent for up to several weeks with continued administration. Thus, considerable attention has been devoted to discovering the long-term neurochemical and biochemical actions of the antidepressant agents that may correlate better with their clinical effectiveness.\n\n【35】The antidepressant agents also produce a myriad of adverse effects that, depending on the agent, may be caused by blockade of histamine receptors, adrenoceptors, and cholinergic receptors in the peripheral and central nervous systems 删除25：<u></u>.\n\n【36】##### Administration\n\n【37】Dosing, which may be by the oral or parenteral routes, is determined empirically in relation to the therapeutic response and the patient’s tolerance of adverse effects. Selegeline transdermal is the only antidepressant available in a patch formulation.\n\n【38】##### Pharmacokinetics\n\n【39】Metabolism of the SSRI fluoxetine results in an active metabolite, norfluoxetine, which has a long half-life. Fluoxetine and paroxetine inhibit a number of liver microsomal enzymes, particularly P450 2D6, that can cause clinically significant drug-drug interactions. Nefazodone inhibits cytochrome P450 3A4, which can result in increased levels of other drugs that are dependent on this metabolic pathway for their inactivation.\n\n【40】Monodemethylation by the liver of the tertiary amines TCAs amitriptyline and imipramine results in, respectively, the active metabolites nortriptyline and desipramine. Venlafaxine has an active metabolite, O \\-desmethylvenlafaxine.\n\n【41】####", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

She reports a history of extremely dry and scaly skin throughout her life, from birth. She has tried numerous topical emollients and keratolytics with only mild–moderate improvement. She reports a family history of dry, scaly skin, but does not think any family member has had cutaneous disease as severe as hers. On examination, there are large plate-like scales on the trunk and extremities that are centrally attached with raised borders, with some areas showing superficial fissures ( 89a , b ).\n\n【4】i. What is the diagnosis and genetic defect?\n\n【5】ii. How does this condition present at birth, and what are the potential complications?\n\n【6】iii. What treatments are available?\n\n【7】Answer 89\n\n【8】i. The patient presents with lamellar ichthyosis, an autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis. The most common mutation observed in patients with classic lamellar ichthyosis is in the gene TGM1 , which leads to transglutaminase-1 deficiency. This deficiency leads to disturbances in the process of cornification and desquamation of the normal epidermis. It is seen most often in patients of Northern European descent or in populations with consanguinity. Lamellar ichthyosis can also be seen less commonly in patients of Northern African descent, which is associated with the presence of a mutation in ABCA12 , which is responsible for transporting lipid substrates across cell membranes.\n\n【9】ii. Neonates with classic lamellar ichthyosis present at birth with a collodion membrane, which is a taut transparent membrane resembling plastic wrap encasing the body, composed of thickened stratum corneum. After birth, the membrane becomes dry and is replaced by large scales that are brown, plate-like and form a mosaic pattern. Potential complications of lamellar ichthyosis are ectropion, eclabium or hypoplasia of the nasal cartilage.\n\n【10】iii. The mainstay of treatment is the use of emollients and humectants to reduce the amount of scaling. The use of topical products containing keratolytics such as α-hydroxy, lactic and salicylic acids can be used. Topical retinoids can also be helpful but may cause irritation to the skin. Severe forms of this disease can be treated with oral retinoids such as isotretinoin and acitretin.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Know the components of an adult health-maintenance visit.\n\n【13】2\\. Learn the screening tests and immunizations that are routinely recommended for adult men.\n\n【14】#### Considerations\n\n【15】The patient described is a healthy 52-year-old man. Health maintenance should be employed to prevent future disease. In general, the approach is immunizations, cancer screening, and screening for common diseases. Generally, colon cancer screening should be initiated at age 50 and beyond. The influenza vaccine should be recommended annually, and the tetanus vaccine every 10 years. The acellular pertussis vaccine is also recommended as many adults have had waning immunity to pertussis and occasional outbreaks of whooping cough have been noted. Since cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of mortality in his age group, screening for cardiovascular disease or risk factors is appropriate.\n\n【16】### APPROACH TO: Health Maintenance\n\n【17】### DEFINITIONS\n\n【18】SCREENING TEST: Assessment device or test that should be cost effective with high sensitivity and can be used on a large population to identify persons with disease\n\n【19】HEALTH MAINTENANCE: Preventative care for patients prior to development of disease\n\n【20】### CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【21】For years, one of the cornerstones of primary care was the “annual physical,” which often consisted of a complete physical examination, blood tests, including complete blood counts (CBCs) and multichemistry panels, and, frequently, annual chest x-rays and electrocardiograms (ECGs). The concept of the “annual physical,” or “health-maintenance examination” is still important; however, the components of the examination have changed over time.\n\n【22】The purposes of the health-maintenance visit are to identify the individual patient’s health concerns, manage the patient’s current medical conditions, identify the patient’s risks for future health problems, perform rational and cost-effective health screening tests, and promote a healthy lifestyle. Prevention is divided into primary prevention and secondary prevention. Primary prevention is an intervention designed to prevent a disease before it occurs. It usually involves the identification and management of risk factors for a disease. Examples of this would be the use of a statin medication to reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in order to lower the risk of coronary artery disease or the removal of colon polyps to prevent the development of colon cancer. Secondary prevention is an intervention intended to reduce the recurrence or exacerbation of a disease. An example of secondary prevention is the use of a statin medication after a person has had a myocardial infarction (MI) so as to reduce the risk of a second heart attack.\n\n【23】Effective screening for diseases or health conditions should meet several established criteria. First, the disease should be of high enough prevalence in the population to make the screening effort worthwhile. There should be a time frame during which the person is asymptomatic, but during which the disease or risk factor can be identified. There needs to be a test available for the disease that has sufficient sensitivity and specificity, is cost-effective , and is acceptable to patients. Finally, there must be an intervention that can be made during the asymptomatic period that will prevent the development of the disease or reduce the morbidity/mortality of the disease process.\n\n【24】The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) is an independent panel of experts in primary care and preventive medicine that reviews evidence and makes recommendations on the effectiveness of clinical preventive services, specifically in the areas of screening, immunization, preventive medications, and counseling. USPSTF recommendations are “gold standards” for clinical preventive medicine. The recommendations of the USPSTF are available online for free at 删除9：<u>www.ahrq.gov/clinic/prevenix.htm.</u> USPSTF grades its recommendations in five categories to reflect evidence strength and overall benefit of an intervention. For recommendations released after May 2007, new grade definitions include levels of certainty regarding an intervention’s net benefit and “suggestions for practice.”\n\n【25】### SCREENING TESTS\n\n【26】Cardiovascular Diseases\n\n【27】Diseases of the cardiovascular system are the leading cause of death in adult men and the management of risk factors for these diseases reduces both morbidity and mortality from these diseases. The USPSTF strongly recommends (Level A <sup><a></a><a>1 </a></sup> ) screening of adults for hypertension by measurement of blood pressure, as screening causes little harm and management of hypertension is effective at reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases. USPSTF also strongly recommends (Level A) screening men aged 35 years or more and women aged 45 years or more for lipid disorders and recommends (Level B) screening adults older than 20 years who are at increased risk for cardiovascular diseases. The screening can take the form of nonfasting total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels or fasting lipid panels that include the low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol. Ultrasonography to assess for abdominal aortic aneurysm is recommended (Level B) for men aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked. There is no recommendation (Level C) for abdominal aortic aneurysm screening for men who have never smoked and it is recommended against (Level D) for women, regardless of smoking status.\n\n【28】The routine use of electrocardiogram (ECG), exercise stress testing, or computed tomography (CT) scanning for coronary calcium is not recommended (Level D) for screening for coronary artery disease in adults at low risk for coronary events. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against these modalities (Level I) in adults at higher risk of coronary events. Screening for peripheral arterial disease in asymptomatic adults is not recommended (Level D) because of the low prevalence of the problem in asymptomatic adults and the lack of evidence for improved outcomes from treatment in the asymptomatic stage.\n\n【29】Cancer\n\n【30】Adults (men and women) older than 50 years are strongly advised (Level A通用删除4(英):<u> <sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> ) to have screening for colorectal cancer . This screening can take the form of fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) using guaiac cards on three consecutive bowel movements collected at home, flexible sigmoidoscopy with or without occult blood testing, or colonoscopy. The optimal intervals for testing are not clear, but FOBT is generally recommended annually, sigmoidoscopy every 3 to 5 years, and colonoscopy every 10 years. An abnormal test result of FOBT or sigmoidoscopy leads to the performance of a colonoscopy.\n\n【31】The USPSTF currently finds insufficient evidence to recommend for or against routine screening (Level I通用删除4(英):<u> <sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> ) for prostate cancer using digital examination or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in men younger than 75 years. Although testing improves detection of prostate cancer, the evidence for improved outcomes is inconsistent. Level I ratings are also given to screening for lung cancer using CT scanning, chest x-rays, sputum cytology, or combinations of these, and to screening for thyroid cancer, skin cancer (I通用删除4(英):<u> <sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> ), or oral cancer.\n\n【32】Screening for bladder, testicular, or pancreatic cancer in asymptomatic adults is not recommended (Level D). Screening for prostate cancer in asymptomatic men older than 75 years is also not recommended (Level D).\n\n【33】Other Health Conditions\n\n【34】Screening for obesity by measuring body mass index (BMI) and providing intensive counseling and behavioral interventions to promote weight loss are recommended for all adults (Level B通用删除4(英):<u> <sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> ). There is insufficient evidence to recommend screening of asymptomatic adults for type 2 diabetes mellitus (Level I通用删除4(英):<u> <sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> ), although screening is recommended (Level B通用删除4(英):<u> <sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> ) for adults with hypertension or hyperlipidemia. Depression screening is recommended (Level B通用删除4(英):<u> <sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> ) if there are mechanisms in place for ensuring accurate diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up. Screening and counseling to identify and promote cessation of tobacco use is strongly recommended (Level A通用删除4(英):<u> <sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> ). Screening and counseling to identify and prevent the misuse of alcohol is also recommended (Level B).\n\n【35】### IMMUNIZATIONS\n\n【36】As is the case for well-child care, the provision of age- and condition-appropriate immunizations is an important component of well-adult care. Recommendations for immunizations change from time to time and the most up-to-date source of vaccine recommendations is the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Its immunization schedules are widely published and are available at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Web site (among other places), 删除9：<u>www.cdc.gov</u>.\n\n【37】The CDC has recently recommended that all adults between 19 and 65 years of age should receive a booster of Tdap in place of a scheduled dose of Td due to waning immunity against pertussis and the presence of an increasing number of cases of pertussis nationwide. Adults who have not had a Td booster in 10 years or more and who have never had a dose of Tdap as an adult should receive a booster vaccination with Tdap. Persons who may need an increase in protection against pertussis, including health-care workers, childcare providers, or those who anticipate having close contact with infants younger than 1 year, should also receive a Tdap booster. An interval of 2 years from the last Td is recommended, although a shorter interval may be used if necessary.\n\n【38】In a 2010 update, the CDC is recommending influenza vaccination for everyone 6 months of age and older. This replaces a recommendation of vaccination based upon risk factors.\n\n【39】Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination is recommended as a single dose for all adults aged 65 years or older. It is also recommended for adults younger than 65 years who are alcoholics or smokers; have chronic cardiovascular, pulmonary (including asthma), renal, or hepatic diseases; diabetes; an immunodeficiency; or who are functionally asplenic. One-time revaccination after 5 years is recommended for those with immunocompromising conditions and asplenia. One-time revaccination is also recommended for those older than 65 years if they were vaccinated longer than 5 years previously and were younger than 65 years at the time of initial vaccination.\n\n【40】Other vaccinations may be recommended for specific populations, although not for all adults. Hepatitis B vaccination should be recommended for those at high risk of exposure, including health-care workers, those exposed to blood or blood products, dialysis patients, intravenous drug users, persons with multiple sexual partners or recent sexually transmitted diseases, and men who engage in sexual relations with other men. Hepatitis A vaccine is recommended for persons with chronic liver disease, who use clotting factors, who have occupational exposure to the hepatitis A virus, who use IV drugs, men who have sex with men, or who travel to countries where hepatitis A is endemic. Varicella vaccination is recommended for those with no reliable history of immunization or disease, who are seronegative on testing for varicella immunity, and who are at risk for exposure to varicella virus. Meningococcal vaccine is recommended for persons in high-risk groups, college dormitory residents and military recruits, with certain complement deficiencies, functional or anatomic asplenia, or who travel to countries where the disease is endemic.\n\n【41】### HEALTHY LIFESTYLE\n\n【42】Along with the discussion of screening and promotion of tobacco cessation and prevention of alcohol misuse, other aspects of healthy living should be promoted by physicians. Exercise has been consistently shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and overall mortality. Even exercise of moderate amounts, such as walking for 30 minutes on most days of the week, has a positive effect on health. The benefits increase with increasing the amount of exercise performed. Studies performed on counseling physically inactive persons to exercise have shown inconsistent results. However, the benefits of exercise are clear and should be promoted. Counseling to promote a healthy diet in persons with hyperlipidemia, other risk factors for cardiovascular disease, or other conditions related to diet is beneficial. Intensive counseling by physicians or, when appropriate, referral to dietary counselors or nutritionists, can improve health outcomes. In selected patients, recommendations regarding safer sexual practices , including the use of condoms, may be appropriate to reduce the risk or recurrence of sexually transmitted diseases. Finally, all patients should be encouraged to use seat belts and avoid driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, as motor vehicle accidents remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in adults.\n\n【43】###", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

This patient has symptoms of a glucagonoma, a rare glucagonsecreting tumor that can cause hyperglycemia, diarrhea, and weight loss. The hyperglycemia seen in these patients will not respond to oral hypoglycemic agents because of the uncontrolled excess glucagon production that continues despite increased insulin levels. Glucagonomas also are associated with necrolytic migratory erythema, a skin rash consisting of painful, pruritic erythematous papules that blister, erode, and crust over.  \nAnswer B is incorrect . An insulinoma would be expected to cause hypoglycemia rather than hyperglycemia.  \nAnswer C is incorrect . Pancreatic adenocarcinoma could explain this patient’s weight loss and abdominal mass. Adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic tail also could account for his hyperglycemia, as these lesions sometimes infiltrate and compromise the pancreatic islets, resulting in insulin deficiency. However, this patient’s painful skin rash would not be consistent with pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

During AF, disordered atrial depolarization, often at rates exceeding 300 to 400 bpm, produces an irregular ventricular response, depending on the number of impulses that are conducted through the atrioventricular (AV) node. The ECG is characterized by absence of discrete P waves and an irregularly irregular ventricular contraction . The incidence of AF increases with age, affecting 5% to 10% of patients older than 75 years. Although many patients can maintain a normal activity level and remain essentially asymptomatic with chronic AF, there are several causes of morbidity from this arrhythmia: it may trigger a rapid ventricular rate leading to myocardial ischemia or exacerbation of heart failure in patients with heart disease, and thrombus formation in the noncontractile atria can lead to systemic embolization (AF is a common cause of stroke).\n\n【26】Anything that causes atrial dilation or excessive sympathetic tone can lead to AF, but the two most common causes of AF are hypertension and coronary atherosclerosis . The common causes of AF are listed in Table 3–1 .\n删除4：<u>Table 3–1 • CAUSES OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION</u>\n\n【27】Structural heart disease (hypertension, mitral valve disease)\n\n【28】Ischemic heart disease\n\n【29】Pericarditis or pericardial injury (post-surgical)\n\n【30】Pulmonary disease (especially pulmonary embolism)\n\n【31】Hyperthyroidism\n\n【32】Stress or increased sympathetic tone (acute illness, pheochromocytoma)\n\n【33】Alcohol consumption (holiday heart syndrome, alcoholic cardiomyopathy)\n\n【34】Sick sinus syndrome (tachy-brady syndrome)\n\n【35】Acute AF with rapid ventricular response must be addressed quickly. The four major goals are: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> hemodynamic stabilization, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> rate control, 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> anticoagulation, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> possible conversion to sinus rhythm. If a patient is hemodynamically unstable (hypotensive, angina pectoris, pulmonary edema), urgent direct current (DC) cardioversion is indicated. If the patient is hemodynamically stable, ventricular rate control can generally be achieved with intravenous beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or digoxin , which slow conduction through the AV node. Once the ventricular rate has been controlled, consideration can be given to reversing the underlying causes (eg, thyrotoxicosis, use of adrenergic stimulants, or worsening heart failure) so that patients can undergo cardioversion to sinus rhythm. This may occur spontaneously or after correction of underlying abnormalities, or it may require pharmacologic or electrical cardioversion. If the duration of AF exceeds 48 hours, the risk of intraatrial thrombus formation increases .\n\n【36】Rate control alone (ie, the use of agents to maintain a slow ventricular response rate) is often effective in managing the symptoms of atrial fibrillation, and it has been shown to be at least as effective as rhythm control for long-term outcomes.\n\n【37】If patients are unstable or persistently symptomatic, however, they may require efforts to terminate the atrial fibrillation, and restore sinus rhythm. The most effective method of terminating AF is electrical cardioversion . After cardioversion, the return of coordinated atrial contraction in the presence of an atrial thrombus may result in clot embolization, leading to a cerebral infarction or other distant ischemic event. Therefore, after 24 to 48 hours of AF, patients should receive 3 to 4 weeks of warfarin therapy prior to and after cardioversion to reduce the risk of thromboembolic phenomena. Alternatively, low-risk patients can undergo transesophageal echocardiography to exclude the presence of an atrial appendage thrombus prior to cardioversion. Postcardioversion anticoagulation is still required for 4 weeks, because even though the rhythm returns to sinus, the atria do not contract normally for some time. Pharmacologic antiarrhythmic agents, such as propafenone, sotalol, and amiodarone may be used to try to maintain sinus rhythm.\n\n【38】Many patients with AF cannot be cardioverted and be expected to remain in sinus rhythm. Two important prognostic factors are left atrial dilation (atrial diameter >4.5 cm predicts failure of cardioversion) and duration of AF. The longer the patient is in fibrillation, the more likely the patient is to stay there (“atrial fibrillation begets atrial fibrillation”) as a consequence of electrical remodeling of the heart. In patients with chronic AF, the management goals are rate control, using drugs to reduce AV nodal conduction (such as digitalis or beta-blockers) as described earlier, and anticoagulation.\n\n【39】Patients with chronic AF who are not anticoagulated have a 1% to 5% per year incidence of clinically evident embolization such as stroke. Risk-assessment tools such as the CHADS2 score (C HF, Hypertension , A ge ≥ 75, D iabetes, S troke or transient ischemic attack history) can be used to estimate stroke risk and need for anticoagulation. For chronic AF caused by valvular disease such as mitral stenosis, the annual risk of stroke is substantially higher. AF that develops in patients younger than 60 years without evidence of structural heart disease, hypertension, or other factors for stroke is termed lone AF , and the risk of stroke is very low , so anticoagulation with warfarin is not used. Instead, aspirin may be used.\n\n【40】Anticoagulation reduces the risk of stroke in patients with chronic AF by two-thirds . New oral anticoagulants such as dabigatran and rivaroxaban have been developed for use in atrial fibrillation, but the oral vitamin K antagonist warfarin remains the most widely used medication for this purpose. Warfarin does not produce a predictable dose-related response; therefore, the level of anticoagulation needs to be monitored by regular laboratory testing using the international normalized ratio (INR). In AF not caused by valvular disease, the goal INR is 2 to 3.\n\n【41】The major complication of warfarin therapy is bleeding as a consequence of excessive anticoagulation. The risk of bleeding increases as the INR increases. If the INR is markedly elevated (eg, INR 6–9) but there is no apparent bleeding, the values will return to normal over several days if the warfarin is held. For higher levels of INR (such as >9) but without bleeding, vitamin K can be administered. If clinically significant bleeding is present, warfarin toxicity can be rapidly reversed with administration of vitamin K and fresh-frozen plasma to replace clotting factors and provide intravascular volume replacement.\n\n【42】#### RHEUMATIC HEART DISEASE\n\n【43】In the case presented in the scenario, the cause of this patient’s AF appears to be mitral stenosis. Because she has a history of acute rheumatic fever, her mitral stenosis almost certainly is a result of rheumatic heart disease. Rheumatic heart disease is a late sequela of acute rheumatic fever, usually becoming symptomatic many years after the original attack. Valvular thickening, fibrosis, and calcifications lead to valvular stenosis. The mitral valve is most frequently involved . The aortic valve may also develop stenosis, but usually in combination with the mitral valve. The right side of the heart is rarely involved.\n\n【44】Most cases of mitral stenosis in adults are secondary to rheumatic heart disease , especially in the developing world. Congenital mitral stenosis is also commonly seen. The physical signs of mitral stenosis are a loud S <sub>1 </sub> and an opening snap following S <sub>2 </sub> . The S <sub>2 </sub> \\-OS (mitral valve opening snap) interval narrows as the severity of the stenosis increases. There is a low-pitched diastolic rumble after the opening snap, heard best at the apex with the bell of the stethoscope. Because of the stenotic valve, pressure in the left atrium is increased, leading to left atrial dilation and, ultimately, to pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension can cause hemoptysis and signs of right-sided heart failure such as peripheral edema. When AF develops, the rapid ventricular response produces pulmonary congestion as a consequence of shortened diastolic filling time. Rate control with intravenous beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers is essential to relief of pulmonary symptoms. In this case, the mitral stenosis likely became symptomatic due to the patient’s pregnancy, with increased blood volume and increased cardiac output of up to 30% to 50%.\n\n【45】#### WOLFF-PARKINSON-WHITE SYNDROME\n\n【46】Another cause of AF is the Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome . In patients with this condition, AF may be life-threatening. In addition to the AV node, patients with WPW have an accessory pathway that provides an alternate route for electrical communication between the atria and ventricles, leading to preexcitation , that is, early ventricular depolarization that begins prior to normal AV nodal conduction. A portion of ventricular activation occurs over the accessory pathway, with the remaining occurring normally through the His-Purkinje system. This preexcitation is recognized on the ECG as a delta wave , or early up-slurring of the R wave, which both widens the QRS complex and shortens the PR interval , which represents the normal AV nodal conduction time 删除33：<u></u>. Some patients with the ECG abnormalities of WPW syndrome are asymptomatic; others have recurrent tachyarrhythmias. Most of the tachycardia is caused by paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia; one-third of patients will have AF. AF with conduction to the ventricles over an accessory pathway is a special case for two reasons. First, when conducted through the accessory pathway, the widened QRS may look like ventricular tachycardia, except that it will have the irregular RR interval of AF . Second, because the AV conduction is occurring through the accessory pathway rather than through the AV node, the ventricular rate may be very rapid, and the usual AV nodal–blocking drugs given for ventricular rate control will not affect the accessory pathway. In fact, beta-blockers, verapamil , and other AV nodal–blocking agents can, paradoxically, increase the ventricular rate and should be avoided in WPW patients with AF . If hemodynamically unstable, DC cardioversion should be performed. If hemodynamically stable, the agent of choice is procainamide or amiodarone, to slow conduction and convert the rhythm to sinus.\n\n【47】删除3：<u>Figure 3–2 .

In which of the following situations, is it reasonable to question their authority when what occurs?\n\n【1】A. They disagree with caregivers.\n\n【2】B. They base their decisions on religious beliefs.\n\n【3】C. Their decision appears in conflict with the best interests of the infant.\n\n【4】D. Never; they can make whatever decision is their choice.\n\n【5】Answer: 32.1 C. As is true for adult patients who lack capacity, decisions for compromised newborns must be made using the best available information about what is best to do. In most cases we accord parents with the right and responsibility to guide these decisions because they usually represent the best source of information, and they are presumed to have the best interests of the newborn at heart. It does not matter whether they agree with caregivers or whether their decisions are based on religious or secular beliefs. At the same time, their power is not limitless, and they must be held to a best interest standard. If the parental choices appear contrary to these interests, then they must be questioned and, in some cases, rejected.\n\n【6】Question: 32.2 In addition to autonomy, which principles of ethics are most important in arriving at a clinical decision?\n\n【7】A. Beneficence and nonmaleficence\n\n【8】B. Justice and honesty\n\n【9】C. Compassion and cultural concerns\n\n【10】D. Futility and dignity\n\n【11】Answer: 32.2 A. The three most important principles in decision-making are autonomy, beneficence, and nonmaleficence, along with the principle of justice. Rarely can these concepts be totally separate, and in attempting to apply one we might of necessity compromise another to some extent. For example, we do in general respect the autonomy of the patient or their surrogate in making decisions, but we must weigh those decisions against the magnitude of possible harm or the injustice of treating one patient completely differently than we would treat others. As an even simpler example, we strive for nonmaleficence, but every therapy or treatment has some inherent risks of harm. If they are counterbalanced by the potential to provide benefit, then we accept this as an acceptable balance.\n\n【12】Question: 32.3 When parents or surrogate decision-makers disagree with caregivers, what is the best approach in attempting to reach a resolution?\n\n【13】A. Defer to parents because they have ultimate decision-making power.\n\n【14】B. Override the parents because they do not understand the medical issues.\n\n【15】C. Engage in ongoing discussions and attempt to engage family members or family advisors.\n\n【16】D. Immediately seek legal recourse.\nAnswer: 32.3 C. When there is a disagreement or impasse, it is most important to attempt to keep and open dialogue between parents and caregivers. This can often be aided and facilitated with the help of ethics consultants, and, frequently, several discussions are needed to help break down the impasse, with the commitment of all participants to keep listening and honestly offering their opinion. These discussions can often be aided by engaging additional family members, family advisors or clergy (as the parents may wish) or by including other medical consultants. Neither should caregivers simply defer to parental wishes without considering whether those wishes are correct or ethically defensible nor should they override such wishes.Seeking an opinion through the legal system is the only recourse in some cases; however, this is usually a late resort. Such action can be disruptive to the therapeutic relationship at a critical time and may add barriers or result in a decision that no one is able to fully accept.\n\n【17】KEY POINTS\n\n【18】 Decisions about the care of newborns are based on the same core ethical principles that guide decisions in adults.\n\n【19】 Newborns lack capacity to make or communicate decisions, and this responsibility falls to surrogates. In nearly all cases, parents are appropriate surrogates.\n\n【20】 As substituted judgment is impossible, most decisions are based or judged on a best-interest standard.\n\n【21】 Decisions about withholding nutrition or fluids in newborns are based on the same principles that guide such decisions in older children and adults.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Several hours before coming to the ED， he was noted to have progressive lethargy and confusion and lost his ability to speak. He had not had nausea， vomiting， diarrhea nor focal weakness or seizures. He was previously in good health， took no medications， and denied recent travel outside of the United States. There were no recent insect bites or pet expo-sures. On physical examination， his temperature was 38.3℃ (101°F) and other vital signs were normal. Expressive aphasia was noted， but there were no focal findings or nuchal rigidity and the pupils were equal and reactive to light. There were no petechiae， splinter hemorrhages， subconjunctival hemorrhages， or heart murmurs. The fundi were normal without papilloedema. A lumbar puncture was performed and the findings from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were as follows：leukocyte count 150/uL with 90% lymphocytes， erythrocytes 500/uL， protein125 mg/dL， glucose 50 mg/dL， and no organisms were seen on a Gram stain.

To describe the most common causes of meningitis and encephalitis.\n\n【6】2\\. To find the differences in the CSF examination in meningitis and encephalitis etiologic agents.\n\n【7】3\\. To discuss the options for treating meningitis and encephalitis.This patient has a typical presentation of sporadic HSV-1 encephalitis. His acute onset of low-grade fever， generalized malaise， and headache which progressed to leth-argy， aphasia， and then focal weakness of the right upper extremity is strongly sug gestive of HSV-1 encephalitis. Seizure is often present. Encephalitis viruses include， Eastern equine encephalitis， St. Louis encephalitis， La Crosse encephalitis， California encephalitis， Powassan fever， and all others， which are less common than West Nile virus (WNV) and HSV-1 encephalitis. In the absence of a known outbreak of WNV， the presentation suggests that the most likely diagnosis is viral encephalitis due to HSV-1. Herpes encephalitis is the most common cause of fatal sporadic encephalitis in the United States and should always be considered in the differential diagnosis“treatable”with antiviral medication. The CSF findings of a lymphocytic pleocyto-sis with a significant number of RBCs and an elevated protein on LP are suggestive of HSV encephalitis. Decreased CSF glucose levels may also be present in HSV encephalitis， but rarely in other viral encephalitis. A positive PCR for HSV-1 in the CSF would confirm the diagnosis. Supporting information for HSV-1 encephalitis may include CT or MRI of the brain， EEG， brain biopsy， and culture of the CFS for HSV. Other considerations would rickettsia (RMSF)； nonspirochetal treponemes(lyme)； fungal (cryptococcosis)； protozoal (acanthoamoeba， Nagleria)； and bacterial etiologies. Therapies should consider geographic exposures， vector exposure (ticks， mosquitoes)， occupation， hobbies and immune defects.Early diagnosis and appropriate therapy (within 2 hours of presentation) of bac-terial meningitis is crucial. More than 75% of all cases of bacterial meningitis in the United States are due to Streptococcus pneumoniae or Neisseria meningitidis. Meningitis due to Haemophilus influenxae has markedly decreased due to widespread immunization with the Haemophilus B influenza conjugate vaccine. Listeria mono cytogenes remains an infection of at-risk patients and infections by this bacterium are sporadic. Less commonly， meningitis due S. agalactiae (Group B Streptococcus) and Escherichia coli may be seen in at-risk patients (neonates， infants， and immuno compromised patients).\n\n【8】Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common etiologic agent of community acquired bacterial meningitis and is often seen in patients with other foci of infec-tion： pneumonia， otitis media， mastoiditis， sinusitis， or endocarditis. It may also be one of the causes of meningitis following CSF leaks due to trauma， iatrogenesis， or congenital defects of the meninges. The pneumococcal 13-valent for children and23-valent vaccine for adults are effective in preventing invasive disease.\n\n【9】Neisseria meningitidis is the second most common sporadic agent of bacterial meningitis and the most common cause of outbreaks and epidemics of bacterial meningitis in the United States. It occurs primarily in children and young adults. Patients with persistent deficiencies in the terminal complement components(C5-C9) are predisposed to infection with N. meningitidis. A quadravalent (A， C，Y， or W-135) conjugate vaccine is available， but does not protects against serogroup B， the agent of one-third of cases in the United States. The ACIP has recommended vaccination be used for the prevention of meningococcal disease in the following individuals：\n\n【10】1\\. Routine vaccination of adolescents at age 11 to 12 years with abooster at age 16\n2\\. A 2-dose primary series administered 2 months apart for persons aged 2 to54 years with persistent complement deficiency (C5-C9)， or functional or ana-tomic asplenia， or HIV infection 删除换行5 Other less common causes of bacterial meningitis include Listeria monocytogenes， Group B streptococci (S. agalactiae)， aerobic gram-negative bacilli and staphylococ-cus species. Listeria monocytogenes meningitis is associated with extremes of age， neonates and persons >50 years of age. Alcoholism， malignancy， immunosuppres-sion， diabetes mellitus， hepatic failure， renal failure， iron overload， collagen vascular disorders， and HIV infection are also predisposing factors. Group B streptococcalMeningitis should be considered if a patient has fever， headache， neck stiffness， and altered mental status. On examination \"jolt accentuation”of the headache elicited with rapid horizontal movement of the head is considered to be more sensi-tive for the diagnosis of meningitis than the traditional Kernig or Brudzinski signs of meningeal irritation. Nuchal rigidity is the inability to flex the head forward due to rigidity of the neck muscles. Kernig sign is positive when the leg is bent at the hip and knee at an angle of 90 degrees， and subsequent extension of the knee is pain-ful. Brudzinski sign is the appearance of involuntary lifting of the legs when the patient's head is lifted from the examining couch when the patient is lying supine. These findings are not specific and may indicate subarachnoid hemorrhage as well as meningitis. Nuchal rigidity， altered mental status， andKernigand Brudzinski signs may be absent but this should not deter an evaluation for meningitis.\n\n【11】The diagnosis of meningitis is established by the analysis of a CSF specimen. At times CT imaging may be necessary prior to performing a lumbar puncture to reduce the risk of brain herniation； however， this imaging should not delay empiric antibiotic therapy. Specific indications for a CT imaging prior to an LP include： focal neurological findings (including seizure)， increased intracranial pressure or papilledema， age >65 years， underlying immune deficiency， and coma. A CSF white cell count 2500/uL， a CSF lactate acid 23.5 mmol/L， or aCSF-to-serum\n\n| Table 17-1·CEREBROSPINAL FLUID FINDINGS IN PATIENTS WITH MENINGITIS  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| CSF Parameter  | Normal  | Bacterial  | Viral  | TB  | Cryptococcal  |\n| Opening pressure(mm H，O)  | 80-200  | 200-500  | ≤250  | 180-300  | \\>200  |\n| Leukocyte count(cells/ul)  | 0-5  | 1000-5000  | 50-1000  | 50-300  | 20-500  |\n| Leukocyte countdifferential  | Lymphsa  | PMN>80%  | Lymphspredominate  | Lymphs#monocytes  | Lymphs  |\n| Glucose (mg/dL)  | 50-70  | <40  | \\>45  | ≤45  | <40  |\n| Protein (mg/dL)  | 15-40  | 100-500  | <200  | 50-100  | \\>45  |glucose ratio ≤0.4 are highly predictive of bacterial meningitis.

A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) should be considered as a diagnostic aid especially for meningitis due to enteroviruses which cause about 85% of the viral meningitis seen in the United States (echovirus， coxsackievirus A and B， and the nonpolio enteroviruses).| Table 17-2。EMPIRIC ANTIMICROBIAL THERAPY FOR PURULENT MENINGITIS  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| PredisposingFactors  | Common Bacterial Pathogens  | Recommended AntimicrobialAgents  |\n| Age 2-50 years  | S. pneumoniae， N. meningitidis  | Vancomycin + a third- generation cephalosporin  |\n| Age >50 years  | S. pneumonia， N. meningitidis，L. monocytogenes， aerobic gram-negative bacilli  | Vancomycin + ampicillin+ athird-genaration cephalosporin  |\n| Basilar skulltracture  | S. pneurnonia， H. influenzae， Group AB-hemolytic streptococci  | Vancomycin + a third-generation cephalosporin  |\n| Postneuro surgeryor head trauma  | S. aureus， S. epidermidis， aerobic gram-negative bacilli (including P.aeruginosa)  | Vancomycin + either ceftazidineor cefepime  |\n| Cerebrospinal fluidshunt  | S. aureus， S. epidermidis， aerobic gram-negative bacilli (inclu ding P. aeruginosa)diphtheroids (including P. acnes)  | Vancomycin + either ceftazi-dime or cefepime  |If the examination of CSF reveals the presence of purulent meningitis and a posi-tive Gram stain suggests a specific etiology targeted antimicrobial therapy must be initiated as quickly as possible (optimally within 30 minutes of arrival in the ED). If the Gram stain is negative， empiric antibiotic therapy is determined by the patient's age and underlying conditions . The administration of dexamethasone concomitant with or just prior to the first dose of antimicrobial therapy will attenu-ate the inflammatory response created by the lysis of certain meningeal pathogens (H. influenzae， Mycobacterium tuberculosis， S. pneumoniae， and Cryptococcus neoformans) byantimicrobial agents. If Listeria monocytogenes is proven or suspected， ampicillin should be included in the antibacterial regimen to which gentamicin may be added for synergy.Viruses are by far the most common cause of encephalitis. Approximately20，000 cases of encephalitis occur in the United States each year， with the pre dominant endemic sporadic cause being the HSV-1. The most common epidemic cause of viral meningitis is WNV followed by other sporadic and epidemic viral etiologies. Rabies encephalitis is now rare in North America. Viral encephalitis presents as an acute-onset， febrile illness associated with headache， altered level of consciousness， and occasionally focal neurologic signs. The clinical presentation of encephalitis can be similar to meningitis but the 2 differ in that meningitis is not always characterized by focal neurologic signs and change in mental status. While fever and headache are the principal manifestations of both syndromes， nuchal rigidity is characteristic only of meningitis.\n\n【13】Arboviral diseases such as Eastern equine encephalitis and St. Louis encephalitis have affected humans in the United States for years. These viral infections may be fatal or have significant morbidity， the prevalence in humans has been low and effective treatments and human vaccines have not been developed. This situation changed in 1999 when the first cases of WNV occurred in the United States. The virus spread throughout the United States and has now been diagnosed in thousands of patients annually with significant morbidity and mortality. WNV encephalitis is most severe in the older age groups with the highest mortality and morbidity rates occurring in those 265 years of age. While most cases of WNV infection are sub-clinical or mild， the disease can be severe and most often occurs during seasonal out-breaks or epidemic conditions. These severe clinical presentations of WNV include encephalitis， meningitis， flaccid paralysis， and fever. Vaccines have been developed for veterinary use in preventing WNV as early as 2001； however， there are currently no approved vaccines for human use for WN J V V .\n\n【14】In the United States nonepidemic， sporadic， or focal encephalitis is most fre quently due to HSV-1 with one-third of the cases occurring in patients <20 years of age and one-half occurring in those over 50 years old. HSV-1 encephalitis results from a reactivation of the latent virus in the trigeminal ganglion， resulting in 删除换行1 inflammatory necrotic lesions in the temporal cortex and limbic system. Most HSV-1 cases occur in the absence of an antecedent illness.After a history and physical examination is completed， CSF analysis should be per-formed including cell count， glucose， protein， cultures (both viral and bacterial)； PCR for specific viral diagnoses including HSV-1， and IgM antibody capture ELISA tests based upon suspected viral etiologies. CSF cultures for HSV-1 and arboviruses are usually negative， but the sensitivity of the PCR for HSV and the arboviral IgM antibody capture ELISA exceeds 90%. In HSV encephalitis， MRI typically dem-onstrates unilateral or bilateral abnormalities in the medial and inferior temporal lobes， which may extend into the frontal lobe. The EEG findings include focal delta activity over the temporal lobes and periodic lateralizing epileptiform discharges(PLEDs). Brain biopsy with fluorescent antibody and histopathology is reserved for patients who do not respond to empiric acyclovir or have negative PCRs of the CSF CT imaging is not as sensitive as MRI with gadolinium.\n\n【15】The CSF typically shows a lymphocytic pleocytosis， an increased number of erythrocytes and an increased concentration of protein； glucose levels are usually normal， but may be low early in the infection. With early HSV-1 encephalitis， the CSF may initially show a PMN predominance which then shifts to a lymphocytosis. Acyclovir should be st ACyarted immediately when HSV-1 infection is suspected. PCR for HSV-1 DNA in CSF should be obtained but treatment should not be delayed waiting for results. A temporal lobe abnormality on MRI (eg， a hemorrhagic lesion) is considered to be a poor prognostic sign for neurologic recovery， although CMV， EBV， and echoviruses can cause the same syndrome of encephalitis infection.\n\n【16】WNV infection is more frequently associated with a poliomyelitis， Parkinson-like syndrome， or a Guillain-Barre type of presentation. Vector-borne diseases such as WNV infection are unlikely events during a Minnesota winter especially when there is no evidence of an outbreak or epidemic. The diagnosis of HSV-1 encepha-litis is critical because it is the only viral infection of the CNS for which antiviral therapy with acyclovir has been proven effective. In HSV encephalitis， prompt acy-clovir treatment reduces mortality to approximately 25% in adults and older children.

Describe the major complications of SLE and its treatment. 删除34：<u>(EPA 12)</u>\n\n【22】Considerations\n\n【23】In patients with chest pain， one of the primary diagnostic considerations is always myocardial ischemia or myocardial infarction (MI). This is particularly true when the ECG is abnormal with changes that may represent myocardial injury， such as ST-segment elevation， However， other conditions may produce ST-segment eleva-tion， such as acute pericarditis. ECG findings can help distinguish between these two diagnoses. Pericarditis may have diffuse ST elevations and PR depressions， whereas STEMI (ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction) typically will dem-onstrate ST elevation consistent with an anatomic area of infarction (eg， anterolat-eral， inferior， posterior， or lateral). The pleuritic nature of the pain and the relief by leaning forward are clues to the diagnosis. Of the multiple possible etiologies， the case discloses some features suggestive of SLE.\n\n【24】APPROACH TO：\n\n【25】Acute Pericarditis and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus\n\n【26】DEFINITIONS\n\n【27】ACUTE PERICARDITIS： An inflammation of the pericardial sac surrounding the heart.\n\n【28】PERICARDIAL FRICTION RUB： Harsh， high-pitched，scratchy sound with vari-able intensity， usually best heard at the left sternal border by auscultation.\n\n【29】CLINICAL APPROACHTO ACUTE PERICARDITIS\n\n【30】Pathophysiology\n\n【31】Acute pericarditis can result from a multitude of disease processes， but the most common causes are listed in Table 10-1.\n\n【32】Clinical Presentation\n\n【33】There is a wide spectrum of clinical presentations for acute pericarditis， ranging from subclinical inflammation， to the classic presentation of acute pericarditis with chest pain， to chronic inflammation， which may persist for weeks to months. Most patients with acute pericarditis seek medical attention because of chest pain. The classic description is a sudden onset of retrosternal chest pain， which worsens on inspiration and with recumbence and often radiates to the trapezius ridge； the pain is improved by sitting and leaning forward. Other clinical features vary according to the cause of the pericarditis， but most patients are thought to have viral infec-tion and often present with low-grade fever， malaise， or upper respiratory illness symptoms.\n\n【34】A pericardial friction rub is pathognomonic and virtually 100% specific for acute pericarditis. The sensitivity of this sign varies， however， because friction rubs may soften and return. Classically， a rub is a harsh， high-pitched， scratchy sound with variable intensity， usually best heard at the left sternal border. It can have one， two， or three components： presystolic (correlating with atrial systole)， systolic， and dia-stolic. The large majority of rubs are triphasic (all three components) or biphasic，\n\n| Table 10-1·COMMON CAUSES OF ACUTE PERICARDITIS  |\n| --- |\n| Diseases of contiguous structures，eg， during transmural myocardial infarction Hypersensitivity/immunologic reactions， eg， Dressler syndromeIdiopathic pericarditis： specific diagnosis unidentified， presumably either viral or autoimmune andrequires no specific management Infectious： viral， bacterial， tuberculous， parasitic Metabolic disease， eg， uremia，Gaucher disease Neoplasms： usually thoracic malignancies such as breast， lung， or lymphomaTrauma： penetrating or nonpenetrating chest injury Vasculitis： autoimmune diseases， postradiation therapy  |\n\n| Table 10-2·PERICARDITIS VERSUS MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ECG Findings  | Acute Pericarditis  | Acute MI  |\n| ST-segment elevation  | Diffuse： in limb leadsas well as V-V  | Regional (vascular territory)，eg，inferior， anterior， or lateral  |\n| PR-segment depression  | Present  | Usually absent  |\n| Reciprocal ST-segmentdepression  | Absent  | Typical，eg， ST-segment depressioninferiorly with anterior ischemia (ST-segment elevation)  |\n| QRS-complex changes  | Absent  | Loss of R-wave amplitude anddevelopment of Q waves  |\n\n【37】having a systolic and either an early or a late diastolic component. In these cases， it usually is easy to diagnose the pericardial friction rub and acute pericarditis. When the rub is monophasic (just a systolic component)， it often is difficult to distinguish a pericardial friction rub from a harsh murmur， making bedside diagnosis difficult and uncertain. In these cases， one should look for ECG evidence of pericarditis and perform serial examinations because the rub may vary with time.\n\n【38】The classic ECG findings in acute pericarditis include diffuse ST-segment eleva-tion in association with PR-segment depression， as seen in this patient. The oppo-site findings (PR-segment elevation and ST-segment depression) are often seen in leads aVR and V. Acute pericarditis may be confused with acute MI due to the presentation with chest pain and ST-segment elevation on ECG. This is potentially a serious problem because if a patient is treated with thrombolytics for infarction， the patient may develop pericardial hemorrhage and cardiac tamponade. Several clinical features can help to differentiate the two conditions： Acute ischemia is more likely to have a gradual onset of pain with a crescendo pattern， more likely to pres-ent with a heavy pressure or squeezing sensation (as opposed to the sharp pain of pericarditis)， typically does not vary with respiration， and is relieved with nitrates(whereas the pain of pericarditis is not). In addition， several ECG features can help to make the distinction . Moreover， if the ECG reveals arrhythmias or conduction abnormalities， the condition is much more likely to represent ischemia rather than pericarditis.\n\n【39】Treatment\n\n【40】Most patients with acute viral or idiopathic pericarditis have excellent progno-ses. Treatment is mainly symptomatic， with aspirin or another nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)， such as indomethacin， for relief of chest pain. Colchicine or corticosteroids may be used for refractory symptoms or comor-bid conditions. In most patients， symptoms typically resolve within days to 2 to3 weeks. Any form of pericarditis can cause pericardial effusion and bleeding； how-ever， the most serious consequence would be cardiac tamponade. It is a common misconception that a pericardial friction rub cannot coexist with an effusion (both are very common in uremic pericarditis). Therefore， it is important to monitor these patients for signs of developing hemodynamic compromise resulting from cardiac tamponade.\n\n【41】CLINICAL APPROACHTO SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS\n\n【42】Pathophysiology\n\n【43】Our patient is very young and has no significant previous medical history. The pres-ence of symmetric arthritis and laboratory findings suggest a systemic disease， such as SLE， as the cause of her pericarditis. SLE is a systemic inflammatory disease that mainly affects women. It is characterized by autoimmune multiorgan involvement， such as pericarditis， nephritis， pleuritis， arthritis， and skin disorders. To diagnose SLE， the patient must meet 4 of the 11 criteria listed in Table 10-3 (96% sensitive and 96% specific). The need of 4 out 11 criteria is imperative for the diagnosis of SLE among patients included in clinical studies； however， it is noteworthy that patients can actually be diagnosed with SLE even with fewer criteria in the right clinical context.\n\n【44】Our patient has serositis (pericarditis)， oral ulcers， hematologic disorders(leukopenia， lymphopenia， and thrombocytopenia)， arthritis， and renal involve-ment (hematuria)-she clearly meets the clinical criteria for SLE. Although the patient in the scenario， like most patients with SLE， sought medical attention because of the pain of arthritis or serositis， both these problems are generally man-ageable or self-limited. The arthritis is generally nonerosive and nondeforming，and the serositis usually resolves spontaneously without sequelae.\n\n【45】Complications\n\n【46】The major complication of SLE usually is related to renal involvement， which can cause hypertension， chronic renal failure， nephrotic syndrome， or end-stage renal disease. In the past， renal disease was the most common cause of death of SLE patients； however， currently lupus neprhritis can be treated with powerful immu-nosuppressants， such as high-dose corticosteroids and mycophenolate or cyclo-phosphamide. Other serious complications of lupus include central nervous system(CNS) disorders， which are highly variable and unpredictable and can include sei-zures， psychosis， stroke syndromes， and cranial neuropathies. In addition to renal failure and CNS involvement， the most common causes of death in SLE patients are infection (often related to the immunosuppression used to treat the disease) and vascular disease， for example， MI.\n\n【47】Table 10-3·DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR SLE\n\n| Table 10-3·DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR SLE  |\n| --- |\n| Malar rash： fixed erythema， flat or raised over the malar area， that tends to spare nasolabial foldsDiscoid rash： erythematous raised patches with adherent keratotic scaling and follicular pluggingPhotosensitivity： skin rash as a result of exposure to sunlight Oral or vaginal ulcers： usually painless Arthritis： nonerosive， involving two or more peripheral joints with tenderness， swelling，and effusion Serositis： usually pleuritis or pericarditis Renal involvement： persistent proteinuria or cellular casts Neurologic disorder： seizure or psychosis Hematologic disorder： hemolytic anemia or leukopenia 删除10：<u>(< 4000/mm)</u> on two or more occasions，or lymphopenia (<1500/mm) on two or more occasions， or thrombocytopenia (< 100，000/mm²)Immunologic disorder： positive anti-double-stranded DNA， anti-Smith Ab， antiphospholipid AbAntinuclear antibody (ANA)： positive ANA in absence of drugs known to induce ANA  |\n删除16：<u>CASE CORRELATION\n删除25：<u>See also Case 3 (Acute Coronary Syndrome)， Case 5 (Aortic Dissection， Marfan Syndrome)， and Case 20 (Peptic Ulcer Disease).</u>\n</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

He has an unremarkable physical examination.

Understand how the different classes of lipid-lowering agents affect lipid levels and the potential side effects of those agents.\n\n【19】4\\. Know the secondary causes of hyperlipidemia.\n\n【20】##### Considerations\n\n【21】A young man presents to the clinic for a checkup and is found to have markedly elevated total cholesterol (normal <200 mg/dL) and LDL levels (normal <100 mg/dL), and low HDL levels (normal >45 mg/dL). He does not have any apparent secondary causes of dyslipidemia, and has no signs or symptoms of vascular disease. He does have a strong family history of hypercholesterolemia and premature death caused by myocardial infarction (MI). The decisions regarding the method and intensity of lipid-lowering therapy are based on one’s estimation of the patient’s 10-year risk of major coronary events. Because of his very high lipid levels and family history, he is a high-risk patient and, thus, should be counseled about lipid-lowering medical therapy. The very high cholesterol levels at a young age in the absence of secondary causes leads one to suspect familial hypercholesterolemia, a condition caused by defective or absent LDL surface receptors and subsequent inability to metabolize LDL particles. Meanwhile, the importance of lifestyle modification cannot be overemphasized.\n\n【22】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【23】#### Hyperlipidemia\n\n【24】#### DEFINITIONS\n\n【25】HYPERLIPIDEMIA: An excess of fats or lipids in the blood, principally due to either elevated cholesterol or triglycerides.\n\n【26】ATHEROSCLEROSIS: Deposition of atheromatous plaques containing cholesterol and lipids on the innermost layer of the walls of large- and medium-sized arteries.\n\n【27】STATIN MEDICATIONS: A class of agents that lower cholesterol by inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, which is a key enzyme in cholesterol synthesis.\n\n【28】#### CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【29】Atherosclerotic coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death of both men and women in the United States. Because of the association of hypercholesterolemia and development of atherosclerotic heart disease, most authorities recommend routine screening of average-risk individuals at least every 5 years. Clinical laboratories usually measure total cholesterol, HDL, and triglycerides. The LDL cholesterol may be calculated by using the formula:\n\n【30】A fasting sample should be measured, if possible, but the total cholesterol and HDL are still reliable in a nonfasting sample. The triglycerides and the calculated LDL levels are affected by recent dietary intake and should be drawn in the fasting state.\n\n【31】Approximately 25% of American adults have a total cholesterol level of more than 240 mg/dL, which is considered elevated according to the guidelines of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP). Management of patients with hypercholesterolemia involves assessment of other atherosclerotic risks to estimate the 10-year risk of coronary events, such as fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction. The LDL goal is set based on the estimated cardiovascular risk as described in the 2002 Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III).\n\n【32】High-risk patients already have an established CHD or other atherosclerotic vascular disease : their 10-year risk for future coronary events is more than 20% . The presence of diabetes now is considered a “CHD risk equivalent” in patients because of their higher risk of vascular disease as well as higher mortality rate from myocardial infarction than is the case with nondiabetics. High-risk individuals have an LDL goal of less than 100 mg/dL according to the ATP III. The intensity of lipid lowering for secondary prevention of CHD in patients with established atherosclerosis is controversial and is evolving. Based on additional studies published after the ATP III, some authors have proposed lower targets (LDL <70 mg/dL) for patients in the very-high-risk category: those with established CHD plus multiple major risk factors such as diabetes or severe and poorly controlled risk factors such as continued smoking, or a recent acute coronary event.\n\n【33】The LDL goal for individuals who do not have established CHD or CHD equivalents (diabetes or other vascular disease such as stroke, peripheral vascular disease, or abdominal aortic aneurysm) is based on a risk stratification process. First, the number of risk factors for CHD is counted . The absolute 10-year risk for patients with two or more risk factors may be estimated using a scoring system based on data from the Framingham heart study 删除33：<u></u>. Patients with multiple risk factors then are assigned to high risk (>20%), intermediate risk (10%-20%), or low risk (<10%). Those in the intermediate-risk category should have an LDL goal of less than 130 mg/dL, whereas the lowest-risk patients have an LDL goal of less than 160 mg/dL.\n删除4：<u>Table 46–1 • CHD RISK FACTORS</u>\n\n【34】Cigarette smoking\n\n【35】Hypertension (elevated blood pressure when seen, or patient on antihypertensives)\n\n【36】Low HDL cholesterol (<40 mg/dL)\n\n【37】Family history of premature coronary artery disease (in men <55 y or in women <65 y)\n\n【38】Age of the patient (men >45 y, women >55 y)\n\n【39】Diabetes mellitus\n\n【40】One should exclude a secondary cause of lipid disorder , either by clinical or laboratory evaluation. The most common underlying causes of dyslipidemia are hypothyroidism and diabetes mellitus . Other conditions to consider are obstructive liver disease, chronic renal failure/nephrotic syndrome, and medication side effects (progestins, anabolic steroids, corticosteroids). Very-high-cholesterol levels in young patients in the absence of secondary causes suggest familial hypercholesterolemia, a condition caused by defective or absent LDL surface receptors and subsequent inability to metabolize LDL particles. Homozygotes for this condition may develop atherosclerotic disease in childhood and usually require intensive lipid-lowering drug therapy.\n\n【41】删除3：<u>Figure 46–1. Risk stratification for coronary heart disease and LDL goals based on CHD risk factors.</u>\n\n【42】Lowering serum cholesterol levels decrease the risk of major coronary events and death in hypercholesterolemic patients without a prior history of CHD (primary prevention) , as well as reducing the overall mortality and coronary disease mortality in patients who have established cardiovascular disease (secondary prevention). All patients should first be educated regarding therapeutic lifestyle changes. These changes include a diet low in saturated fat (<7% of total daily calories) and low in cholesterol (<200 mg/d), as well as exercise, which can help to lower cholesterol.\n\n【43】When lifestyle modifications are not enough to reach the LDL goal, multiple lipid-lowering medications are available. Table 46–2 lists their effects on lipids and their potential side effects. Statins are generally very well tolerated, but the most common side effect is myopathy , which may manifest as muscle tenderness with elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels. Low-grade myalgias occur in <10% of patients, but severe myopathy is reported in 0.5% of statin-treated patients. Less commonly, elevated liver enzymes , or even severe hepatitis, have been reported. When these drugs are used, routine clinical or laboratory monitoring for these effects is advisable. After initiating statins, LDL cholesterol should be checked after 6 weeks, and every 6 to 12 months thereafter, or as the clinical situation dictates.\n删除4：<u>Table 46–2 • DRUGS FOR HYPERLIPIDEMIA</u>\n\n【44】####", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

They can occur simultaneously as you can go back and forth between steps; the process is also circular, as new data is gathered as you implement plans.\n\n【2】删除3：<u>Figure 1.2 is a diagram of the six tasks of formulating. A list of 28 standards is provided in Appendix I, Chart I.A; standard numbers from that list are used throughout this book.</u>\n\n【3】删除3：<u>Figure 1.2 Overview of case formulation tasks and processes</u>\n\n【4】### 1\\. Gather Data\n\n【5】The formulation process begins with gathering data—we will be using the term database for the body of information available for a specific client. The term data is acceptable to practitioners who use scientific models (e.g. the medical-psychiatric model and the research-based cognitive-behavioral model), but it might sound dehumanizing to people who describe themselves as humanists. Bear in mind that the terms data and database simply mean information and are theory free.\n\n【6】The contents of the database must be free of theoretical assumptions, inference, diagnoses, and interpretation: Different professionals would agree about the content of the database, regardless of their orientation.\n\n【7】The medical profession developed terms for two categories of data: Subjective data come from what the patient and the patient’s family reports about the symptoms, the onset, impairments in daily functioning, allergies, medications, family history, and medical/surgical history. Objective data come from observations, physical exam, lab work, imaging studies, and other diagnostic procedures. This distinction translates well to mental health problems.\n\n【8】The distinction between S and O data is the SOURCE:\n\n【9】The source of subjective data: the client’s Story\n\n【10】The source of the objective data: the clinician’s Observations\n\n【11】Data gathering usually starts before the therapist sets eyes on the client, with a phone call to make an appointment. The first session is a major source of information about the client; however, the data-gathering process occurs in every session. In the beginning, your focus is on identifying and exploring problems. Later in therapy, data are gathered for evaluating whether treatment is effective in helping the client achieve outcome goals.\n\n【12】Because the clinical interview is the main tool of data gathering, the clinician must be a competent interviewer or the validity of the database is compromised. Therapists need to become aware of their personal values, cultural biases, and possible countertransference issues that could lead to biased or incomplete data. In clinical training, the building of case formulation skills should be integrated with the development of interviewing skills.\n\n【13】Chapter 2 presents suggestions for gathering a comprehensive, unbiased database, and Chapter 5 presents guidelines for organizing and presenting data.\n\n【14】There are four standards for presentation of the database:\n\n【15】1.  Standard 12. The database does not contain formulation concepts (unless they are quotations from the client).\n2.  Standard 13. The database is comprehensive, with sufficient data so that multiple hypotheses can be applied.\n3.  Standard 14. The subjective and objective data sections contain the correct type of information.\n4.  Standard 15. The subjective section is well organized, appropriately selective, and condensed.\n\n【16】### 2\\. Define Problems\n\n【17】We all have a tendency to rush to explanations and solutions, instead of spending time identifying the problem or problems. The ability to create good problem titles might be the most important skill taught in this book. A preliminary list of problems is derived from the client’s initial complaints, as well as from your focused questions and clinical observations. Occasionally, problems are identified through complaints from people who know the client. In defining problems, you will make many judgments and decisions. Certain complaints need to be “normalized,” instead of targeted for treatment. As new data are gathered, problem definitions may change. Problem titles must be agreeable to practitioners of all orientations.\n\n【18】Give each problem a clear, specific, and understandable title, worded without theoretical jargon.\n\n【19】Chapter 3 explains the problem identification and definition process.\n\n【20】There are seven standards for problem definition:\n\n【21】1.  Standard 1. Problems are defined as solvable targets of treatments.\n2.  Standard 2. Problem titles refer to the client’s real-world problems and current level of functioning.\n3.  Standard 3. Problem titles are descriptive, designed for a specific client, and justified by the data that have been collected.\n4.  Standard 4. Problem titles do not contain theoretical, explanatory concepts.\n5.  Standard 5. Problem titles reflect the client’s values, not the therapist’s personal or cultural bias.\n6.  Standard 6. Lumping and splitting decisions are justified in that they lead to good treatment planning.\n7.  Standard 7. The problem list is complete and comprehensive.\n\n【22】### 3\\. Specify Outcome Goals\n\n【23】Outcome goals are the desired state at the end of therapy, referring to the client’s behavior outside of the therapy session—in real life. The wording of outcome goals must be free of theoretical jargon. For instance, “to make the unconscious conscious” or “to become a fully actualized person” are faulty outcome goals: They (a) contain theoretical constructs and (b) are too idealistic and utopian to be achieved. The wording of these goal statements must be changed so that the goal is specific, realistic, and attainable.\n\n【24】Outcome goals must be defined in a way that allows verification of whether they are attained. The concept of evidence-based practice is not possible unless we are clear about the evidence that represents effective therapy. By specifying outcome goals, we determine how we know that we have achieved problem resolution and that it is appropriate to terminate therapy. Reference to outcome goals in the plan helps to focus your intervention strategy. Furthermore, outcome goals do not contain any clues about the “how” of therapy or the techniques used in the process. Thus therapists from different orientations will agree on what a successful outcome is, even as they prepare to use different treatment strategies to attain it.\n\n【25】The definition of problems and the specification of outcomes are bidirectional processes. Defining a problem leads to specification of goals, and sometimes goal setting comes first and helps define a problem. As the vision of the desired future becomes clearer, the wording of the problem may be modified.\n\n【26】There is a logical relationship between a problem title and a goal. When you write a clear problem title, the outcome goal often seems self-evident, as in this example:\n\n【27】1.  Problem: Lack of friends\n2.  Outcome: Initiate and maintain a friendship\n\n【28】The identification of the desired outcome can shape the wording of the problem title:\n\n【29】1.  Outcome: Decide on a career goal\n2.  Problem: Indecision and ambivalence about career goals\n\n【30】During therapy, you will continually reassess the goals of treatment. As goals are met, you can cross problems off the problem list. If new problems are defined, outcome goals can be specified and changed. Certain goals may be recognized as too costly in time and effort.\n\n【31】In creating goals for clients, distinguish between outcome goals and process goals , and be sure that the outcome goal does not mention process. Outcome goals refer to desired client functioning at the termination of therapy, such as “demonstrate competence in handling conflict.” Process goals refer to desired in-session experiences (e.g. ventilation of feelings, demonstration of insight, behavioral rehearsal, or building a hierarchy of feared situations). Process goals, unlike outcome goals, are based on the therapist’s conceptualization. If a goal refers to the therapist’s actions and intentions (e.g. to help, to facilitate, to support, or to challenge), it is a process goal.\n\n【32】Chapter 4 provides guidelines for outcome goals; process goals are discussed in Chapter 7 as part of treatment planning.\n\n【33】There are four standards for outcome goals:\n\n【34】1.  Standard 8. Outcome goals are directly related to the problem title and endorsed by the client.\n2.  Standard 9. Outcome goals do not contain the therapist’s conceptualization.\n3.  Standard 10. Outcome goals are realistic, attainable, and testable with evidence of the client’s real-world functioning.\n4.  Standard 11. Outcome goals do not contain the “how” of the treatment plan.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Immediately afterward， the patient should undergo broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotic administration， including coverage for gram-positive organisms such as Staphylococcus spp. The vas-cular catheter should be removed， if possible.\n\n【15】Objectives\n\n【16】1\\. Recognize the possible sources of infection in a neutropenic patient. 删除34：<u>(EPA 1，2)</u>\n\n【17】2\\. Discuss the management of a patient with neutropenic fever. 删除34：<u>(EPA 4)</u>\n\n【18】3\\.

Describe the strategies to prevent infection in immunosuppressed patients， including granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and vaccination of household contacts. 删除34：<u>(EPA 4， 12)</u>\n\n【20】Considerations\n\n【21】This patient is being treated for a hematologic malignancy with combination che-motherapy， which has a common side effect of leukopenia， especially neutropenia. Generally， the nadir of the white cell count occurs 7 to 14 days after the chemother-apy. This patient has neutropenia， defined as an ANC less than 1000 cells/mm. The ANC is calculated by neutrophil percent multiplied by total WBC count. Infection in this immunosuppressed condition is life threatening， and immediate antibiotic coverage is paramount. Neutropenic patients are at risk for a variety of bacterial， fungal， or viral infections， but the most common sources of infection are the skin or oral cavity (gram-positive bacteria) and the bowel (gram-negative bacteria). Because of the absence of WBCs， the patient may not manifest the cardinal 删除换行1 inflammatory signs. The spectrum of coverage of empirical antibiotics should include enterobacteria， Pseudomonas species， and penicillin-resistant pneumococci. Methicillin-resistant Stapbylococcus aureus (MRSA) should also be considered in neutropenic patients with skin infections， pneumonia， suspected indwelling cath-eter infections， or sepsis. Rapid initiation of empiric antibiotic therapy is critical while attempts to find a source of infection are in progress.\n\n【22】DEFINITIONS\n\n【23】CENTRAL LINE-ASSOCIATED BLOODSTREAM INFECTION (CLABSI)：\n\n【24】A primary bloodstream infection (ie， there is no apparent infection at another site) that develops in a patient with a central line in place within the 48-hour period before onset of the bloodstream infection that is not related to infection at another site. Culturing the catheter tip or peripheral blood is not a criterion for CLABSI.\n\n【25】CATHETER-RELATED BLOODSTREAM INFECTION (CRBSI)： The pres-ence of bacteremia originating from an intravenous catheter.\n\n【26】CENTRAL VENOUS CATHETER： A CVC is a catheter that is inserted into a large vein such as the subclavian， internal jugular， or femoral vein.\n\n【27】FEVER： Single oral temperature measurement greater than or equal to 101 °F(38.3C) or a temperature greater than or equal to 100.4 °F (38.0°C) for 1 hour or more.\n\n【28】MUCOSITIS： Breakdown of skin and mucosal barriers as a result of chemotherapy or radiation. Mucositis can result in bacteremia or fungemia.\n\n【29】NEUTROPENIA： ANC less than 1000 cells/mm. It is considered severe when the number is lower than 500 cells/mm.\n\n【30】CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【31】Pathophysiology\n\n【32】Fever in a neutropenic patient with cancer should be considered a medical emergency. Approximately 5% to 10% of cancer patients will die of neutropenia-associated infection. Individuals with a hematologic malignancy (leukemias or lymphomas) are at an even greater risk for sepsis as a result of lymphocyte or granulocyte dys-function or because of abnormal immunoglobulin production. Chemotherapy often causes further bone marrow suppression and neutropenia. The incidence of an occult infection in a neutropenic patient increases with the severity and duration of the neutropenia (high risk if > 7-10 days， and especially if ANC < 100 cells/mm’). Some neutropenic patients (eg， the elderly or those receiving corticosteroids) may not be able to mount a febrile response to infection； thus， any neutropenic patient showing signs of clinical deterioration should be suspected of having sepsis.\n\n【33】CVCs are in widespread use and are common sites of infection in hospi-talized patients and patients receiving outpatient infusion therapy. Infection may occur as a consequence of contamination by gram-positive skin flora or by hematogenous seeding， usually by enteric gram-negative organisms or Candida spp. Erythema， purulent drainage， and induration are signs of infection.\n\n【34】In the absence of obvious tunnel or exit-site infection， authorities recommend obtaining two or more blood cultures to try to diagnose catheter-related bactere-mia， with at least one from the CVC. Catheter-related infection is suspected when a patient has two or more positive blood cultures obtained from a peripheral vein； clinical manifestations of infection (eg， fever， chills， and/or hypotension)； and no alternative apparent source of bloodstream infection. In some institutions， quanti-tative blood cultures (counting colony-forming units \\[CFUs\\]) are obtained under the assumption that a four-fold higher colony count will be obtained from blood drawn from an infected catheter than blood drawn from a peripheral vein， support-ing the diagnosis of catheter-related bacteremia. A blood culture that is drawn from the CVC that becomes positive at least 20 minutes before the peripheral blood cul-tures is an indication that the CVC is the likely source of infection. If the catheter is removed， the tip of the catheter may be cut off and rolled across a culture plate， using a quantitative culture method.\n\n【35】Clinical Presentation\n\n【36】The typical signs and symptoms of infection noted in immunocompetent patients are the result of the host's inflammatory response. This may be minimal or absent in neutropenic patients. Soft tissue infections may have diminished or absent indu-ration， erythema， or purulence； pneumonia may not show discernible radiologic infiltrates； meningitis may not reveal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis； and urinary tract infection may be present without pyuria. Infected catheters may manifest as an infection of the subcutaneous tunnel， infection at the exit site， or catheter-related bacteremia and sepsis.\n\n【37】Treatment\n\n【38】Empiric antibiotic therapy should be administered promptly to all neutropenic patients at the onset of fever. Historically， gram-negative bacilli， mainly enteric flora， were the most common pathogens in these patients. Empiric coverage for gram-negative bacteria， including Pseudomonas aeruginosa， is almost always indicated for neutropenic fever. Early treatment is associated with reduced mortality. Currently， as a consequence of frequent use of CVCs， gram-positive bacteria account for 60%to 70% of microbiologically documented infections. Another clue that the infection is likely to be a gram-positive organism includes the presence of obvious soft tissue infections， such as cellulitis or oral mucositis. This causes breaks in the mucosal barriers and allows oral flora to enter the bloodstream. If any of these factors is present， an appropriate agent， such as vancomycin， should be added to the regimen. If patients continue to be febrile despite antibacterial therapy， empiric antifungal therapy should be considered. Figure 42-1 shows a useful algorithm for patient management.\n\n【39】删除3：<u>Figure 42-1. Algorithm of a suggested approach to neutropenic fever.</u>\n\n【40】Catheter-Related Infection. The two main decisions impacting suspected catheter-related infection are 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> whether the catheter is really the source of infection and， if it is， and 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> must the catheter be removed or can the infection be cleared with antibiotic therapy alone? Most nontunneled or implanted catheters should be removed. For more permanent catheters， the decision to remove the catheter depends on the patient's clinical state， identification of the organism， and the pres-ence of complications， such as endocarditis or septic venous thrombosis.\n\n【41】S. aureus and coagulase-negative Stapbylococcus are the most common causes of catheter-associated infections. For coagulase-negative Stapbylococcus bacteremia， response to antibiotic therapy without catheter removal is possible up to 80% of the time. Generally， erythema overlying the subcutaneous tract of a tunneled catheter necessitates catheter removal. Leaving the catheter in place may result in severe cellulitis and soft tissue necrosis. If there is only erythema at the exit site， it may be possible to salvage the line using antibiotics， usually vancomycin， through the CVC.\n\n【42】Considerations for removal would be those infections caused by fungi or non-tuberculous mycobacteria or if there is persistent bacteremia after 48 to 72 hours of appropriate antimicrobial treatment. Keeping the catheter in place is also usually not advisable in critically ill or hemodynamically unstable patients. Bacteremia as a consequence of S. aureus， gram-negative organisms， and fungemia caused by Candida spp responds poorly to antimicrobial therapy alone. Therefore， prompt removal of the catheter is recommended.\n\n【43】Prevention. Because of the serious complications associated with neutropenia， preventive measures are critical in cancer patients who are receiving chemotherapy. Patients should be immunized against pneumococcus and influenza. Administration of live virus vaccines， such as measles-mumps-rubella or varicella zoster， is gener-ally contraindicated. G-CSF， which stimulates the bone marrow to produce neu-trophils， is frequently used prophylactically in patients receiving chemotherapy to shorten the duration and depth of neutropenia， thereby reducing the risk of infec-tion. It is sometimes used after a neutropenic patient develops a fever， but its use at this point is controversial and may result in more harm than benefit.\n\n【44】Prophylactic use of oral quinolones to prevent gram-negative infection or the use of antifungal agents to prevent Candida infection may reduce certain types of infection， but it may also lead to the emergence of resistant organisms. Thus， this is recommended for patients who are anticipated to have an ANC < 100 cells/mm’for more than 7 days； antiviral agents are also recommended to reduce the risk of herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster reactivation in this setting. Other recom-mendations include avoiding sick contacts and overcrowded areas， as well as proper handwashing and cough etiquette. Slight trauma to mucosal surfaces can cause bac-teremia， so careful oral hygiene， avoidance of rectal thermometers or rectal exami-nations， and skin care are also important.\n删除16：<u>CASE CORRELATION\n\n【45】●See also Case 40 (Anaphylaxis/Drug Reactions) and Case 41 (Urinary Tract Infection and Sepsis in the Elderly).\n</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

She is unable to get up and remains prone on the floor overnight until a neighbor notices her missing and calls 911. She is taken to the emergency department where she is noted to have several hematomas on her face and a large hematoma on her right upper thigh. On physical examination， the patient is unable to flex her right hip or extend her right lower leg. Patellar reflex cannot be elicited on the right. Leg adduction and abduction are intact bilaterally.\n\n【2】What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【3】Weakness of the quadriceps muscles and hip flexors (which are innervated by the femoral nerve) and lack of patellar reflex suggests femoral neuropathy (L2-L4). The cause of the neuropathy in this case is a hematoma (secondary to trauma) compressing the nerve. Because both the hip flexors (L2-L3) and the quadriceps muscles (L3-L4) are involved， the nerve is affected above the inguinal ligament. If the compression had affected the nerve distal to the inguinal ligament where the nerve branches into anterior and posterior divisions， a deficiency in either the hip flexors (anterior) or the quadriceps muscles (posterior)， but not both， would be expected.\n\n【4】What sensory defects are expected in this patient?\n\n【5】The femoral nerve innervates the skin of the anterior and medial thigh； thus， light touch sensation is decreased in these areas. The lateral aspect of the thigh is innervated by the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (L2-L3) and is spared in an isolated femoral neuropathy. The saphenous nerve is a cutaneous branch of the femoral nerve that arises from the femoral nerve in the femoral triangle. It innervates the skin of the anteromedial knee， leg， and foot to the medial side of the big toe. Because this lesion is above the femoral ligament， the saphenous nerve distribution is also involved.\n\n【6】What other structures are found with this nerve in the femoral triangle?\n\n【7】The femoral nerve is the largest branch of the lumbar plexus and， after forming in the abdomen， runs posterolaterally to the inguinal ligament. It crosses under the inguinal ligament lateral to the psoas muscle and enters the femoral triangle. In the femoral triangle (bounded by the sartorius muscle，inguinal ligament， and adductor longus)， it runs lateral to the femoral artery， which is lateral to the femoral vein. The vessels are enclosed within the femoral sheath and the nerve is outside it.\n\n【8】Why is thigh adduction spared in this patient?\n\n【9】The major muscles responsible for thigh adduction are the adductor longus， adductor brevis， adductor magnus， and the gracilis， which are innervated by the obturator nerve (L2-L4). Because this is a peripheral neuropathy， not pathology of the nerve root， the obturator nerve is spared and so is thigh adduction.\n\n【10】What other clinical scenarios can be associated with this condition?\n\n【11】· Diabetic vasculitic damage.\n\n【12】·LDirect penetrating trauma.\n\n【13】●Hip fracture.\n\n【14】lliac aneurysms.\n\n【15】●Incorrect placement of the femoral line.\n\n【16】P Prolonged hip flexion during gynecologic or urologic procedures.\n\n【17】Tumor.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The patient is seated and leaning forward. He states that the pain is less severe in this position, and worsens when he lies down and takes a deep breath. He recently recovered from a febrile illness. On physical examination a scratchy, leathery sound is heard at the left lower sternal border. An ECG shows diffuse ST-segment elevation. Which of the following describes the microorganism that is the most likely cause of this condition?\n\n【1】> (A) Catalase-and coagulase-positive cocci\n\n【2】> (B) Double-stranded, linear, enveloped, icosahedral DNA virus\n\n【3】> (C) Double-stranded, segmented RNA virus\n\n【4】> (D) Positive, single-stranded, helical RNA virus\n\n【5】> (E) Small, naked, single-stranded RNA virus\n\n【6】 Answer: The correct answer is E. The patient presents with classic signs and symptoms of pericarditis, including precordial chest pain. This pain is relieved when leaning forward and worsens with inspiration. On physical exam the patient has a pericardial friction rub, which accounts for the scratchy, leathery sound heard during both systole and diastole. Classic ECG findings include diffuse ST-segment elevation and depression of the PR segment. Pericarditis is frequently preceded by a viral upper respiratory infection. Although many viruses may cause pericarditis, coxsackie B is the most common cause of inflammation of the pericardial membrane. Coxsackievirus is a picornavirus, the smallest of the RNA viruses. They are positive, single-stranded, naked, icosahedral RNA viruses.  \nAnswer A is incorrect. Staphylococcus aureus is a gram-positive, catalase-positive, and coagulase-positive bacterium. Infection with S aureus may lead to acute bacterial endocarditis from seeding secondary to bacteremia. The bacterium rarely causes pericarditis.  \nAnswer B is incorrect. This describes the structure of Herpesviridae. Herpesvirus is characterized by multinucleated giant syncytial cells with intranuclear inclusion bodies. Members of this family include CMV and Epstein-Barr virus. Both cause a mononucleosis syndrome in young adults similarly characterized by fever and pharyngitis. Both cause pericarditis only rarely.  \nAnswer C is incorrect. Reoviridae is the only double-stranded RNA virus. Members of this family include rotavirus, which is responsible for diarrhea in children, and reovirus, which causes Colorado tick fever.  \nAnswer D is incorrect. This answer choice describes the structure of Coronaviridae. Coronavirus (CoV) is a common virus that causes a self-limited cold-like syndrome.

This is very important during the diagnosis process and treatment planning procedures since patients view themselves from the frontal perspective and no coincidence of midlines is very evident.\n\n【10】Treatment strategies include growth modification and occlusal guidance. They have to be applied in growing children during primary or mixed dentition to minimize dentoalveolar and skeletal disharmonies that can affect normal growth.\n\n【11】Facial symmetry means balance throughout all the structures of the face. There is a very thin line to determine when asymmetry really begins.\n\n【12】A thorough diagnosis is the basis for success. A detailed medical and dental history along with radiographs and functional studies that help to determine the real reason of the asymmetry are important.\n\n【13】The digital panoramic radiograph is very useful to determine bone and dental discrepancies between the right and left structures. A midsagittal reference plan is also useful to determine not only the quantity but also the place of the discrepancies.\n\n【14】Normally there are differences between the right and left side of the face. Unfortunately there is not a critical number or measurement that can delimit it and is often determined “by the clinician’s sense of balance and the patient’s perception of the imbalance” 删除10：<u>(Bishara 2001 )</u>.\n\n【15】Asymmetries can be classified in dental, skeletal, functional, or a combination of all of them. Soft tissues play an important role since they can make asymmetries more evident or, contrary to this, hide them 删除33：<u></u>.

Dental asymmetries can be caused by proximal caries, loss of temporary molars, agenesias, discrepancies in the mesiodistal size of the anterior teeth, compression of the upper arch with molars in crossbite position, etc.\n\n【22】Both types of asymmetries can cause uni- or bilateral posterior dental or skeletal crossbite.

The functional factors most frequently found are premature contacts that deviate the path of occlusion when the patient closes in central occlusion.\n\n【23】Diagnosis is the most important stage to determine the correct treatment plan.

Some clinical cases need asymmetric mechanics, while with others, surgery is the best option.\n\n【27】The following patient clearly demonstrates this.\n\n【28】This 8-year and 6-month-old patient was sent to the office by her family dentist to correct the posterior right crossbite.

Some of the suggested etiologic factors in crossbite include prolonged retention of deciduous teeth, crowding, premature loss of the deciduous teeth, arch deficiencies, etc.\n\n【30】The first issue is to attain a correct diagnosis to identify the real problem. When the lateral crossbite is accomplished with a midline deviation, a diagnosis in centric relation is mandatory to determine if the patient has a skeletal asymmetry or if it is a posterior crossbite with a functional shift.\n\n【31】The treatment and retention plan would be completely different in each case.\n\n【32】删除3：<u>Fig. 11.5 删除换行1 ( a , b ) Front dental photographs in central occlusion ( a ) and in central relation ( b )</u>\n\n【33】The lateral photos showed that the first and second temporary molars as well as the permanent first molar were in a complete crossbite position on the right side and “normal” occlusion on the left side with fairly good oral hygiene 删除33：<u></u>.\n\n【34】删除3：<u>Fig. 11.6 删除换行1 ( a , b ) Lateral views in the first appointment.

She complained of exertional shortness of breath and had a cardiac murmur.\nShe was a known case of hypertension, adequately controlled by medication. Her  删除换行1 breathlessness had been felt since the last 4 months but had significantly worsened  删除换行1 over the preceding 2 weeks. There was no history of exertional chest pain or of  删除换行1 palpitation and fainting. She did not smoke or consume alcohol but she seldom  删除换行1 exercised and did not follow the diet-plan suggested by her physician.\nOn examination, she was overweight without any clinical signs of cortisol excess  删除换行1 or hypothyroidism. The pulse was regular, good in volume at a rate of 92 beats/min.\nThe BP was 136/88 mm Hg in the right arm. There was no sign of heart failure. The  删除换行1 apex beat was hyperdynamic, ill-sustained heaving in nature and displaced towards  删除换行1 the left axilla. The S1 删除换行1  was soft. A2 删除换行1  was loud and a soft S3 删除换行1  was audible in early diastole.\nA soft blowing pansystolic murmur was audible over the mitral area, that radiated  删除换行1 towards the axilla. Also, a short diastolic rumble was heard over the cardiac apex.\nFew basilar rales were auscultated over the lower lung fields.\n删除3：<u>Figure 7.1: Mitral regurgitation</u>\n\n【4】CLINICAL DISCUSSION \n\n【5】From the history and physical examination, this woman had mitral regurgitation  删除换行1 删除33：<u></u> with possibly associated mitral stenosis and evidence of left ventricular 30 Section 2 Mitral Valve Diseases 删除换行1 dilatation. The S1 删除换行1  was soft since the mitral leaflets are close to each other at the end  删除换行1 of diastole and snap together softly. The A2 删除换行1  was loud due to associated systemic  删除换行1 hypertension. The displacement of the apex beat and audible S3 sound are  删除换行1 indicative of left ventricular diastolic overload. The S3 删除换行1  is a low-pitched sound that  删除换行1 follows the A2 删除换行1 . It indicates abrupt halting of left ventricular filling. Physiological \n\n【6】S3 删除换行1  is appreciated in mitral regurgitation, left-to-right shunt and high cardiac  删除换行1 output states. Pathological S3 删除换行1  is audible in aortic regurgitation and left ventricular  删除换行1 systolic dysfunction.\nThe pansystolic murmur of mitral regurgitation typically radiates to the  删除换行1 left axilla (and sometimes even to the left scapula), if the anterior mitral leaflet  删除换行1 is diseased. It radiates to the base of the heart, if the posterior mitral leaflet  删除换行1 is involved. This differentiates it from the pansystolic murmur of tricuspid  删除换行1 regurgitation or a ventricular septal defect. The accompanying diastolic rumble  删除换行1 does not necessarily indicate concomitant mitral stenosis and is due to torrential  删除换行1 flow across the valve, which is the sum of normal atrial blood volume and the  删除换行1 regurgitant volume. It is worth mentioning that the murmur of acute or severe  删除换行5 MR is not pansystolic but early systolic, because less turbulence is generated  删除换行1 by the large valve orifice. Moreover, the rapid rise of left atrial pressure impedes  删除换行1 regurgitation during later systole. The murmur of mitral annular calcification is  删除换行1 also typically early systolic.\n删除3：<u>Figure 7.2: X-ray showing cardiac enlargement  删除换行1 straightening of left heart border</u>\n\n【7】ECG of the patient showed tall R waves in left precordial leads with upright \n\n【8】T waves, indicating left ventricular diastolic overload. X-ray chest findings  删除换行1 were moderate cardiomegaly, pulmonary congestion and straightening of the  删除换行1 left heart border 删除33：<u></u>. The “4-bump” left heart border is due to a large left  删除换行1 atrial appendage, which is damaged during acute carditis and bulges due to  删除换行1 high left atrial pressure in rheumatic mitral regurgitation (MR). On ECHO, the  删除换行1 left ventricle was dilated and hyperkinetic with an ejection fraction of 55% and  删除换行1 left atrial enlargement. Importantly, in functional MR due to annular dilatation  删除换行1 secondary to cardiomyopathy, there is global hypokinesia of the left ventricle Case 7 Mitral Regurgitation 31\n\n【9】Table 7.1: Assessment of the severity of mitral regurgitation \n\n【10】Mild Moderate Severe \n\n【11】MR jet area (cm2 删除换行1 ) <4 4-8 >8\n\n【12】Percent of LA area (%) <25 25-50 >50\n\n【13】MR Volume (ml/beat) <30 30-59 >60\n\n【14】LV dysfunction Mild-to-moderate Severe\n\n【15】Ejection fraction (%) 30-60 <30\n\n【16】LV diameter (mm) 40-55 >55 删除换行1 or a regional wall motion abnormality.

Other potential abnormalities of  删除换行1 the mitral valve in case of MR are mitral leaflet redundancy and prolapse, flail  删除换行1 leaflet, annular calcification or vegetations in case of endocarditis.\n删除3：<u>Figure 7.3: ECHO showing a color-flow map  删除换行1 in the left atrium</u>\n\n【17】On colour flow mapping, a regurgitant jet was seen entering the left atrium  删除换行1 删除33：<u></u>. The volume of MR (ml/beat), the MR jet area (cm2 删除换行1 ) and the percentage of  删除换行1 left atrial area (%) filled by the jet are used to gauge the severity of MR .\nHowever, there are some fallacies associated with these calculations. The spatial  删除换行1 profile of the MR jet does not truly reflect the regurgitant volume. It depends upon  删除换行1 the shape of the valve orifice, the angle of the jet, left ventricular filling pressure  删除换行1 and the size of the left atrium. The MR jet may be “eccentric” or “off-centre” in  删除换行1 case of leaflet prolapse, papillary muscle rupture and paraprosthetic leak.\nThere are several causes of mitral regurgitation (MR). Usual causes of  删除换行1 primary MR are rheumatic heart disease, mitral leaflet prolapse, papillary muscle  删除换行1 dysfunction, infective endocarditis and mitral annular calcification. Uncommon  删除换行1 causs include congenital endocardial cushion defects, endomyocardial fibrosis 32 Section 2 Mitral Valve Diseases\n\n【18】Table 7.2: Causes of mitral regurgitation\n\n【19】Chronic MR\n\n【20】•  Mitral valve prolapse\n\n【21】•  Dilated cardiomyopathy\n\n【22】•  Endomyocardial fibrosis\n\n【23】•  Rheumatic heart disease\n\n【24】•  Mitral annular calcification\n\n【25】•  Connective tissue disorder\n\n【26】•  Papillary muscle dysfunction\n\n【27】Acute MR\n\n【28】•  Acute myocardial infarction\n\n【29】•  Infective endocarditis\n\n【30】•  Blunt chest trauma.\nand connective tissue disorders. Occasionally, secondary MR is due to mitral  删除换行1 annular dilatation, as a result of dilated or ischemic cardiomyopathy. Acute  删除换行5 MR can result from rupture of papillary muscle or chordae tendinae in case of  删除换行1 myocardial infarction, infective endocarditis or after blunt trauma to the chest  删除换行1 .\nMANAGEMENT ISSUES \n\n【31】Patients of rheumatic MR below the age of 40 should receive penicillin prophylaxis  删除换行1 to protect them from acute rheumatic fever. Those undergoing a dental or  删除换行1 surgical procedure, need antibiotic prophylaxis against infective endocarditis.Vasodilators such as ACE inhibitors or ARBs combined with a diuretic relieve  删除换行1 pulmonary congestion, especially if systemic hypertension is present. Digoxin  删除换行1 and an anticoagulant are used if there is concomitant atrial fibrillation. Secondary  删除换行5 MR is reduced by lowering preload and afterload, which decrease the diameter  删除换行1 of the mitral annulus.\nSurgical operations for MR are mitral valve repair and valve replacement.\nRepair of the valve or annuloplasty is preferable if the valvular anatomy is  删除换行1 suitable, since it preserves left ventricular geometry and spares the patient from  删除换行1 the problems of anticoagulation. Replacement of the valve is indicated if the  删除换行1 valvular anatomy is severely distorted.\nRECENT ADVANCES \n\n【32】Mitral regurgitation in the context of ischemic heart disease is a clinical  删除换行1 challenge. The MR is not due to an intrinsic valvular abnormality, but the result  删除换行1 of ventricular dilatation with annular enlargement, papillary muscle dysfunction  删除换行1 and dysfunctional ventricular remodeling with increased sphericity. These  删除换行1 patients can be offered restrictive annuloplasty, which involves insertion of an  删除换行1 undersized annular ring to improve leaflet apposition. Therefore, patients who  删除换行1 are to undergo coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery should be adequately  删除换行1 assessed preoperatively for mitral regurgitation.

The drug described is propylthiouracil (PTU), a standard agent in the treatment of hyperthyroidism. This agent inhibits both the conversion of iodide to elemental iodine and the organification of iodine with tyrosine, therefore blocking the production of mono- and diiodotyrosine within thyroid follicular cells. In addition, PTU inhibits the peripheral conversion of thyroxine (T4 ) to triiodothyronine (T3 ), the most active biological form of thyroid hormone; T3 is approximately 10 times more potent than T4 . The majority of T3 is converted in the peripheral tissue, liver, and kidneys. Two important adverse effects of PTU are exfoliative skin rash (most common) and agranulocytosis (most severe, but fortunately quite rare).  \nAnswer A is incorrect. Propylthiouracil has no effect on the binding of T3 to the thyroid hormone receptor.  \nAnswer B is incorrect. Perchlorate and thiocyanate are two ionic inhibitors that block the thyroid’s ability to sequester iodide. These drugs are rarely used today but have been used to treat Graves disease and amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis.  \nAnswer C is incorrect. This describes the mechanism of levothyroxine, the drug most commonly used in to treat hypothyroidism. It is an analog of endogenous T4 . Also used in neonates with thyroid deficiency, this medication can prevent mental retardation if administered within two weeks of delivery.  \nAnswer E is incorrect.

Jason’s OCPD complicated his treatment, contributed to his fair insight, and was a factor in his few remaining symptoms at termination. OCPD is relatively common in OCD patient populations, with prevalence estimates of comorbid OCPD ranging from 23 to 35 % 删除10：<u>(Albert et al. 2004 ; Pinto et al. 2006 , 2011 ; Samuels et al. 2000 )</u>. Compared to OCD patients without OCPD, individuals with both conditions tend to have poorer insight into the senselessness of their symptoms 删除10：<u>(Lochner et al. 2011 )</u>, and OCPD has also been linked to worse treatment outcomes. For example, Pinto et al. 通用删除7(英):<u>( 2011 )</u> found that OCD patients with comorbid OCPD benefited less from E/RP. Importantly, compared to other OCPD traits, maladaptive perfectionism was especially predictive of poor E/RP outcome 删除10：<u>(Pinto et al. 2011 )</u>.\n\n【2】Jason’s excessive cleaning behaviors (hand washing, picking hairs, and lint off the carpet) were mainly motivated by fears of becoming ill with the flu, but they also related to perfectionistic tendencies with regard to standards for tidiness and neatness. The therapist had much greater difficulty eliciting change talk for some of these behaviors. For example, though Jason recognized that his hand washing was excessive and problematic, he reported that picking crumbs, hair, and lint off of his carpet was “the right thing to do.” These symptoms were congruent with Jason’s underlying desire for orderliness and would be considered “ego-syntonic.” Through treatment, Jason was able to gradually reduce these behaviors, but they were not entirely eliminated. This case highlights the importance of investigating OCPD traits as complicating factors in E/RP treatment, especially in terms of treatment motivation 删除10：<u>(Pinto et al. 2008 )</u>.\n\n【3】Conclusions and Practice Points\n-------------------------------\n\n【4】Psychotherapy involving E/RP has the potential to substantially improve the lives of individuals with OCD, though problems with motivation can result in a failure to maximally benefit from this treatment. Limited motivation can manifest as reluctance, not only to starting E/RP but also to progressing through increasingly anxiety-provoking exposures. Among several techniques that show promise to enhance motivation for E/RP, MI offers practitioners one approach to enhance motivation and facilitate treatment.\n\n【5】Consistent with the view that reluctance for change and treatment stems from underlying ambivalence, MI suggests that therapists avoid confrontation and argumentation during treatment, instead suggesting that they defuse discord by supporting patient autonomy and expressing understanding and acceptance of the patient’s conflicting feelings about treatment and change. A central component of MI is the notion that people learn what they think in part by hearing themselves speak. MI encourages patients to talk about the importance of change by highlighting the discrepancy between current behaviors and the patient’s important life goals and values. MI practitioners also attempt to elicit talk of confidence in the ability to change by highlighting and fostering patient self-efficacy.\n\n【6】In the case of Jason, problems with limited motivation became evident through nonadherence to homework and reluctance to take on some exposures. MI-congruent strategies, particularly reflective listening, articulating values, highlighting discrepancy, and decisional balance discussions proved helpful at enhancing Jason’s willingness to fully participate in treatment, while also bolstering his sense of self-efficacy. Once Jason committed to change, treatment progressed rapidly and his symptoms were significantly reduced.\n\n【7】The case history presented here illustrates how limited motivation can be targeted in adults with OCD, highlighting MI, one of several strategies that have been used to enhance motivation. Other strategies include cognitive techniques and readiness therapy, in addition to modifications that can be made within the E/RP protocol itself. Optimal treatment should be tailored to each individual’s presenting concerns and could include a combination of these motivational enhancement techniques for patients with limited motivation for treatment.\n\n【8】Importantly, though some empirical research has been done on the topic of motivation for treatment in OCD, substantial questions remain. In particular, no studies have directly compared different motivational-enhancement techniques, or systematically evaluated how best to integrate such efforts with E/RP (i.e. as a stand-alone treatment before E/RP entry or interwoven within standard E/RP). Future research is also necessary to determine which interventions are most effective at improving patient adherence to E/RP treatment and whether this improved patient adherence then causally leads to improved treatment outcome. Finally, the case reviewed here was relatively straightforward. In other instances, E/RP treatment can be complicated by factors such as poor insight and other forms of comorbidity (e.g. severe depression). It is not clear if MI is effective in these cases, again highlighting the need for greater research on motivational enhancement in conjunction with OCD treatment.\n\n【9】Key Practice Points\n-------------------\n\n【10】   Limited motivation may interfere with the ability of some OCD patients to adhere to E/RP treatment, limiting their ability to fully benefit from this treatment.\n   MI aims to increase motivation for change and willingness to fully participate in treatment.\n   An MI approach aims to resolve ambivalence in favor of patients’ intrinsic motivation for change.\n   Specific MI strategies including eliciting change talk, defusing discord, and highlighting discrepancy between the patient’s current behaviors and important goals and values.\n   Strategies derived from an MI approach can be used alongside E/RP procedures and may help enhance adherence to this treatment for some individuals.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The term dysphasia denotes a disorder in language processing caused by damage to this network.\n\n【11】DIAGNOSIS\n\n【12】This patient has expressive dysphasia (lesion) caused by a right-sided stroke (aetiology).\n\n【13】QUESTIONS\n\n【14】Where is the lesion?\n\n【15】In Broca's area， which is located in the posterior portion of the third left frontal gyrus.

The majority of young children who stutter go on 删除换行1 to make a full recovery. The disorder may continue unabated in some， resulting in a prevalence of about 1% among adults.\n\n【24】What is the commonest sign of primary progressive aphasia?\n\n【25】The commonest clinical feature of primary progressive aphasia is anomia(the inability to retrieve the right word in conversation or to name objects as requested by an examiner). The early stages of anomia can be detected by asking the patient to name geometric shapes， parts of the body， or components of common objects (the cap of a pen or the wristband of a watch). Many patients remain in an anomic stage through most of the course of the disease， with a gradual intensification of word-finding defi-cits almost to the point of mutism. Occasionally， distinct forms of agram-matism or deficits in word comprehension develop.\n\n【26】What do you understand by the term agrammatism?\n\n【27】Agrammatism refers to inappropriate word order and the misuse of word endings， prepositions， pronouns， conjunctions and verb tenses.\n\n【28】What do you know about genetics of speech?\n\n【29】● Linkage studies of prevalent types of speech and language disorders have implicated several regions of the genome， most notably on chro-mosomes 3， 13， 16 and 19. The putative risk genes underlying these linkages have yet to be identified.\n\n【30】●Mutation in FOXP2， which is located in chromosomal band 7q31 and encodes a transcription factor， has been described in a British family with autosomal dominant transmission of oral motor and speech dys-praxia. These patients have problems sequencing the precise move-ments of tongue， lips， jaw and palate that contribute to intelligible speech (known as verbal dyspraxia or childhood apraxia of speech). They also have difficulties with learning and production of non-speech sequences involving the orofacial musculature (orofacial dyspraxia) and have a broad profile of linguistic deficits in expressive and receptive domains-problems that affect both oral and written language. The protein product， FOXP2， downregulates the expression of CNTNAP2， a gene that encodes a neurexin protein. The general relevance of CNTNAP2 to speech dyspraxia remains to be determined.CNTNAP2 is probably associated with disorders associated with nonsense-word rep-etition (e.g. autism).\n\n【31】● Genes at 7q11.23 are exquisitely sensitive to dosage alterations， which can influence human language and visuospatial capabilities.\n\n【32】·Genetic factors have been implicated in stuttering， with linkage to markers on chromosome 12 and variations in genesgoverning lyso-somal metabolism 删除10：<u>(N Engl J Med 2010；362：677-85)</u>.\n\n【33】Pierre Paul Broca 通用删除7(英):<u>(1824-1880)</u> was Professor of Surgery in Paris.

Pulmonary function tests， old anesthetic records， and a complete neurological examination are useful because they give an idea of pre-existing neurological deficits and also help plan the course of the anesthetic based on previous performance and pulmonary function. An electrocardiogram， chest x-ray， and CBC in an otherwise healthy40-year-old female is unlikely to add additional information that is helpful in the management of this patient.\n\n【16】31.2. B. Succinylcholine， is metabolized by the plasma enzyme pseudo-cholinesterase. Thus in patients taking cholinesterase inhibitors， the action of succinylcholine may be prolonged. Answer A， cisatri-curium， is metabolized by Hoffmann degradation. C， pyridostigmine， is a drug used predominantly for the treatment of myasthenia gravis. Pyridostigmine bromide is an analogue of neostigmine that inhibits acetylcholinesterase as well as plasma pseudocholinesterase， and thus the breakdown of acetylcholine. D， dexamethasone， is not metabo-lized by pseudocholinesterase.\n\n【17】31.3. D. Higher body temperatures have been associated with an increase in neuronal demyelination and relapses. Hence， keeping normal body temperature and avoiding hyperthermia in patients with multi-ple sclerosis is important. Pre-anesthetic documentation of neurolog-ical deficits is important because new deficits can sometimes appear postoperatively. Stresses such as pain and anxiety have been impli-cated in relapses. Although there is no definitive proof that spinal anesthesia is associated with relapses and onset of new neurological deficits， most anesthesiologists would avoid spinal anesthesia in a patient with sever multiple sclerosis. Stress doses of steroids are con-troversial but most anesthesiologists would consider a dose of steroid in any patient who has abruptly stopped steroid medications.\n\n【18】Clinical Pearls\n\n【19】Myasthenics are usually exquisitely sensitive to nondepolarizing muscle relaxants and these drugs should be used sparingly if at all.\n\n【20】 Patients suffering from myasthenia gravis have a varied and unpredictable response to nondepolarizing muscle relaxants.\n\n【21】Drugs that can increase muscle weakness in myasthenics include neuro-muscular blocking agents， volatile anesthetics，anticholinesterases，amino-glycoside antibiotics， beta blockers， prolonged steroid administration， lithium， magnesium，and local anesthetics.\n\n【22】\\> In patients with multiple sclerosis， minimizing surgical stress，controlling pain， fever， hemodynamic fluxes to intubation as well as maintenance of normal body temperature are goals of the anesthetic plan.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

It is more frequent in \n\n【4】Australia, but it is very rare in Negroes.\n\n【5】(iv) Site.— Palms, soles and external genitalia are  删除换行1 the common sites. It may also occur beneath the nail  删除换行1 when it is called subungual melanoma. This is more often  删除换行1 seen in the thumb or great toe.

Melanoma may also  删除换行1 be seen in choroid of the eye or even in meninges.\nMalignant melanoma is also noticed in the rectum and  删除换行1 anal canal.\n\n【6】(v) Role of trauma.— Though there is a tendency to  删除换行1 believe that repeated trauma to a naevus may turn it  删除换行1 into malignant melanoma, yet definite evidences are yet  删除换行1 to be received.\n\n【7】(vi) Role of pregnancy.— Similarly pregnancy is also  删除换行1 alleged to provoke malignant change in a naevus.\nOestrogen has got some influence in producing melanin  删除换行1 pigment and it is true that pregnancy has a bad influence  删除换行1 on the course of the malignant melanoma. But pregnancy  删除换行1 has probably little influence in provoking malignant  删除换行1 change in a naevus.\n\n【8】(vii) Steroid hormones may have influence to  删除换行1 produce malignant melanomas.\n\n【9】(viii) The role of ultraviolet light as an aetiologic  删除换行1 factor remains unresolved. Melanoma is commonly seen  删除换行1 in sun-exposed areas of the body. Particularly lentigo  删除换行1 maligna and superficial spreading melanoma develop in  删除换行1 these areas.\n\n【10】PATHOLOGY.— Malignant melanoma is a malignant  删除换行1 neoplasm of melanocytes and accounts for 1 to 3% of all  删除换行1 cancers. Malignant melanoma is classified mainly into 3  删除换行1 types — Lentigo Maligna Melanoma (LMM), (ii)\nSuperficial Spreading Melanoma (SMM) and (iii) Nodular\nMelanoma (NM). Histologically melanomas exhibit two  删除换行1 patterns of growth — growth by lateral spread of the  删除换行1 tumour within the dermis (horizontal growth) and growth  删除换行1 by downward dermal invasion (vertical growth). LMM  删除换行5 and SMM exhibit more of lateral spread than vertical  删除换行1 growth; whereas NM shows more of vertical growth. The  删除换行1 cells of horizontal growth are known as 'surround cells'  删除换行1 and those with vertical growth are called nodules cells'.\nIn Lentigo Maligna Melanoma the surround cells are  删除换行1 irregularly shaped cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and 删除换行1 dermis is indicated by the presence of circular or  删除换行1 polyhedral cells with abundant spongiocytoplasm and fine  删除换行1 pigment granules.\n\n【11】The tumour cells may form small clusters in the  删除换行1 subepidermal lymphatics — a dreadful indication of early  删除换行1 stage of lymphatic spread.\n\n【12】Subepidermal zone is invaded by inflammatory cells  删除换行1 mostly lymphocytes. This is always suggestive of malignant  删除换行1 change.\n\n【13】In fully developed melanoma the large tumour cells 删除换行4 arranged along the dermoepidermal junction and are  删除换行1 aggregated in nests. These atypical cells frequently  删除换行1 conglomerate around the external root sheath of the hair  删除换行1 follicle. The nodule cells are spindle-shaped cells  删除换行1 (malignant melanocytes). The nuclei of these cells contain  删除换行1 coarsely clumped chromatin and prominent eosinophilic  删除换行1 nucleoli. Their cytoplasm is usually finely granular and  删除换行1 stains pink with haematoxylin and eosin. These nodule  删除换行1 cells are often mixed with epitheloid cells. One can  删除换行1 always see a dermal infiltrate of lymphocytes, histiocytes  删除换行1 and melanin-laden macrophages.\n删除3：<u>Fig. 1.23.— Four stages of Malignant Melanoma. Stage I — it is above the basement membrane. Stage II — tumour is invading the  删除换行1 papillary but not reticular dermis. Stage III — the tumour has invaded the dermis. Stage IV — the tumour is invading the subcutaneous 删除换行1 tissue with lymphatic permeation and embolism.</u>\n\n【14】In superficial spreading melanoma there is horizontal  删除换行1 growth within the dermis. The surround cells with  删除换行1 prominent finely granular cytoplasm and large nuclei and  删除换行1 nucleoli are uniformly more atypical than the surround  删除换行1 cells of lentigo maligna melanoma. Individual cells of  删除换行1 superficial spreading melanoma are predominantly  删除换行1 epitheloid and less often they are spindle shaped.\n\n【15】Nodular melanoma has the worst prognosis because  删除换行1 it grows rapidly and deeply invasive. Dermal invasion is  删除换行1 the predominant histologic feature, but lateral spread of  删除换行1 the tumour is absent. Although the tumour cells appear  删除换行1 highly malignant, they often exhibit uniformity. Individual  删除换行1 cells are either epitheloid or spindle cell in type.\n\n【16】With the development of malignant melanoma there  删除换行1 is increase in junctional activity and the cells increase in  删除换行1 size. The proportion of nucleus to cytoplasm is increased,  删除换行1 the nucleous is enlarged, hyperchromatism is present and  删除换行1 mitoses are observed. The cytoplasm is often vacuolated  删除换行1 with fine melanin granules to mimic Paget cell. In  删除换行1 determining whether a naevus has become malignant or  删除换行1 not the surface layers of the epidermis are examined for  删除换行1 invasion by cells which are vacuolated. Invasion of the 删除换行1 in the dermis often show alveolar arrangement, the  删除换行1 grooves being separated by a fine stroma.\n\n【17】PATHOLOGICALLY malignant melanoma can be \n\n【18】STAGED according to Clark's level of invasion. Level I \n(in situ) applies when all tumour cells are above the  删除换行1 basement membrane. Level II has tumour extension into  删除换行1 the papillary but not the reticular dermis. In level III  删除换行5 the tumour cells reach the interface between the papillary  删除换行1 and reticular dermis. Level IV refers to tumour cells  删除换行1 reaching the reticular dermis. In level V tumour cells  删除换行1 invade the subcutaneous fat.\n\n【19】Breslow introduced staging by measuring maximal  删除换行1 thickness of the lesion at the centre of it. Stage I is  删除换行1 categorised by thickness 0.75 mm or less; Stage II —\n\n【20】Clark's Levels 删除换行1 10 -\n\n【21】2-0 - 删除换行1 2? 40-\n\n【22】Subcutaneous\n\n【23】Tissue\n\n【24】删除3：<u>Fig. 1.24.— Shows different levels of invasion of malignant  删除换行1 melanoma. Both Clark's levels and Breslow's depth of invasion </u>\n(mm) have been shown in this diagrammatic figure. 1, 2, 3, 4, 删除换行1 5 indicate corresponding levels I, II, III, IV, V of Clark. Remember  删除换行1 that depth of invasion of malignant melanoma is the most  删除换行1 important single criterion to indicate the prognosis of the disease.SKIN AND SUBCUTANEOUS TISSUE 27 删除换行1 0.76 to 1.50 mm; Stage III — 1.51 to 3.00 mm; Stage  删除换行5 IV — more than 3.00 mm. It is a reliable and important  删除换行1 determinant of the therapy and prognosis. A close  删除换行1 correlation exists between tumour thickness and prognosis.\nIn stage I the melanoma is of low risk and it has not  删除换行1 metastasised. In stage II the risk is intermediate with  删除换行1 25% incidence of metastasis. In stage III and IV the  删除换行1 tumour is of high risk with 60% incidence of metastasis.\nClark's level I corresponds with Breslow's stage I. Clark's  删除换行1 level II and III correspond with stage 11 of Breslow and \n\n【25】Clark's level IV and V correspond with Breslow's stages \n\n【26】III and IV respectively. There is good evidence that  删除换行1 tumour thickness is a better measure of prognosis than  删除换行1 the level of invasion.\n\n【27】CLINICO-PATHOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION.— \n\n【28】Five clinico-pathological types of melanoma have been  删除换行1 recognised. It must be remembered that though majority  删除换行1 of the melanomas can be placed in one of these types,  删除换行1 a small percentage of cases may have features of 2 or  删除换行1 more types.\n\n【29】1. Superficial Spreading Melanoma (SSM).— This is  删除换行1 the most common variety and accounts for 64% of all  删除换行1 melanomas. The mean age of the patients is 55 years.\nThis occurs on any part of the body — both sun-exposed  删除换行1 and non-exposed areas; but common sites are the lower  删除换行1 legs of women and the chest and back of men. It is  删除换行1 called superficial as the depth of the lesion is not much,  删除换行1 but the diameter is rarely more than 2 to 3 cm. The  删除换行1 lesion is a slightly raised nodule or plaque with variegated 删除换行1 colour pattern — pink, brown, grey, blue and black  删除换行1 colours (differing pigmentation). It has an irregular border 删除换行1 which is characteristic. The lesion is palpable and small  删除换行1 nodules may develop within it.\n\n【30】2. Lentigo Maligna Melanoma (LMM).— It is called \n\n【31】Hutchinson's melanotic freckle. It is least common and  删除换行1 accounts for only 7 to 12%. It is the least malignant. The  删除换行1 individuals in their 6th, 7th or 8th decade of life are  删除换行1 usually involved by this type (mean age of patients is 70  删除换行1 years). It may occur anywhere in the body which is  删除换行1 exposed to the sun, though most frequently seen on the  删除换行1 face. It begins as a pigmented flat naevus. This neoplasm  删除换行1 presents as a large flat patch with focally raised areas.\nThese raised areas correspond to areas of dermal invasion.\nThese lesions often measure 6 cm or more. It grows  删除换行1 very slowly over a period of years. In few areas it is  删除换行1 advancing, whereas in other places it may regress. There  删除换行1 is also colour variation within the tumour from brown to  删除换行1 black. It is characterised by irregular margin. Malignant  删除换行1 change is recognised by increasing thickness of the lesion  删除换行1 and development of discrete nodule within the lesion.\n\n【32】3. Nodular Melanoma (NM).— It accounts for 13 删除换行1 to 25% of all melanomas. It affects younger individuals  删除换行1 (mean age of patients is 45 years). It may also occur  删除换行1 anywhere in the body. It appears as a raised lesion, blackbrown in colour, though other colour may be present. It  删除换行1 is characterised by uniform colour either grey or black  删除换行1 or even bluish black. The students must remember that  删除换行1 it is the most malignant of all varieties. It has a smooth  删除换行1 surface and its margin is quite sharp, though irregular.\nAbsence of lateral spread is evidenced by normal colour  删除换行1 of skin adjacent to the tumour. Being a very malignant  删除换行1 lesion, it ulcerates early and easily bleeds.\n\n【33】4. Acral-Lentiginous Melanoma (ALM).— This type  删除换行1 of lesion is seen on the palm, sole, subungual areas and  删除换行1 mucocutaneous junctions. This is the same aggressive  删除换行1 tumour as nodular melanoma. This is the commonest  删除换行1 type of lesion in coloured people.\n\n【34】5. Amelanotic Melanoma.— This type of melanoma  删除换行1 is characterised by its very little pigment and hence its  删除换行1 name. The lesion looks pink instead of black, though at  删除换行1 the base one may find some black pigmentation. The  删除换行1 cells which form this tumour lose the capacity to produce  删除换行1 melanin, though they contain the precursor of melanin  删除换行1 pigment. This is the most virulent of all varieties of  删除换行1 melanoma even the nodular melanoma. Regional lymph  删除换行1 node metastasis is almost always present.\n\n【35】This malignant tumour kills patients by  删除换行1 producing wide spread metastasis.\n\n【36】1. LOCAL EXTENSION.— Malignant melanoma  删除换行1 spreads initially by local extension by continuity and  删除换行1 contiguity.\n\n【37】From the original site of the tumour the tumour  删除换行1 cells grow peripherally in the juinctional layer and in  删除换行1 this way melanotic halo is produced. Malignant melanoma  删除换行1 has a tendency to form satellite nodules in the skin and  删除换行1 such nodules develop progressively at greater distance  删除换行1 from the original tumour. Such nodules develop from 2  删除换行1 types of spread — (i) local spread and (ii) lymphatic  删除换行1 spread — through lymphatic permeation the tumour cells  删除换行1 grow along the lymphatics and form nodules at greater  删除换行1 distances.\n\n【38】The deep fascia acts as a strong barrier and malignant 删除换行1 melanoma hardly infiltrates the deep fascia.\n\n【39】2. LYMPHATIC SPREAD.— This is the commonest  删除换行1 spread of malignant melanoma. The tumour cells reach  删除换行1 the regional lymph nodes by embolism and permeation.\nSatellite nodules are seen in the transit between the  删除换行1 primary growth and regional lymph nodes. Secondary  删除换行1 lymphoedema may occur due to early involvement of the  删除换行1 regional lymph nodes.\n\n【40】In malignant melanoma of the eye there is no lymph  删除换行1 spread.\n\n【41】3. BLOOD SPREAD.— Blood spread is a late  删除换行1 event and may be absent until nearly the end. The  删除换行1 skin is a common site of metastasis. Secondary growths  删除换行1 appear in the skin early. Liver, lungs, bones and brain  删除换行1 may be involved by blood borne metastasis. Some  删除换行1 unusual sites may be involved by blood spread e.g. the  删除换行1 small intestine, the heart and the breasts.\n\n【42】Sometimes liver has been metastasised even after  删除换行1 many years of removal of the eye due to malignant  删除换行1 melanoma.\n\n【43】CLINICAL FEATURES —\n\n【44】1. Increase in size.— The patient usually complains  删除换行1 that a long standing mole has suddenly shown rapid  删除换行1 growth within the last few days. Such increase in size  删除换行1 occurs in all directions. The moles become wider and  删除换行1 thicker.\n\n【45】2. Change in colour.— The benign mole becomes  删除换行1 darkar. Such colour change is often patchy. Some areas  删除换行1 may show increased vascularity. Sometimes malignant  删除换行1 melanoma does not show pigment and such lesion is  删除换行1 called amelanotic melanoma.\n\n【46】3. Bleeding.— The overlying epithelium becomes  删除换行1 ulcerated and often breaks down with minor injury. This  删除换行1 tends to bleed. These changes are particularly noticed  删除换行1 when the growth has become malignant.\n\n【47】4. Evidence of local spread.— Tumour cells gradually  删除换行1 invade the surrounding skin to produce a halo, which  删除换行1 indicates appearance of malignancy. Gradually the  删除换行1 malignant cells permeate through the intradermal  删除换行1 lymphatics and cause satellite nodules at a little distance  删除换行1 away from the primary tumour. Gradually more satellite  删除换行1 nodules develop at greater distances.\n\n【48】5. Enlarged regional lymph nodes.— This indicates  删除换行1 that the growth has turned malignant.\n\n【49】SYMPTOMS.— Malignant melanoma is extremely rare  删除换行1 before puberty. The commonest site in males is the front  删除换行1 or back of the trunk in the white; whereas the sole of  删除换行1 the foot, palm and external genitalia are common sites in  删除换行1 case of the coloured. In case of females lower leg is a  删除换行1 common site in the white. Rarely melanomas arise in  删除换行1 the eye, in the meninges and in the mucocutaneous  删除换行1 junctions e.g. mouth, anus etc. The incidence of melanoma  删除换行1 appears to be increasing in the true sense. Melanoma is  删除换行1 far more common in the white population than it is in  删除换行1 the black. The white : black ratio for melanoma is 20 \n\n【50】: 1. The pathologic type for blacks is most commonly  删除换行1 acral-lentigal melanoma and the sole of the foot is the  删除换行1 site of primary lesion in approximately 60% of patients.\n\n【51】When benign mole shows the cardinal symptoms of 删除换行1 malignant change, malignant melanoma is the most  删除换行1 probable diagnosis. Malignant melanoma is not painful.\n\n【52】It often itches. Sometimes the patient may complain of  删除换行1 lymph node enlargement, that means swelling in the  删除换行1 groin, axilla or neck according to the region of the  删除换行1 primary tumour.\n\n【53】Only in late cases one may complain of weight loss,  删除换行1 dyspnoea or jaundice (due to hepatic involvement).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

There, computed tomography (CT) of his head revealed a large (> 100 cm <sup>3 </sup> ) intracerebral hemorrhage, extending into the lateral ventricles and associated with hydrocephalus. An external ventricular drain (EVD) was placed, and he was found to have elevated intracerebral pressure (ICP). Over the first 48 hours, the patient’s ICP was difficult to control. After 6 days the patient remained in a coma and dependent on a ventilator, but with some brainstem reflexes (eg, gag reflex, blink reflex) intact. All of the caregivers involved, including the patient’s wife, who is his legally designated health care proxy, recognized that there was no meaningful chance for a good neurologic outcome. A decision is made by all involved to stop the patient’s ventilator, intravenous fluids, and medications, understanding that he would die shortly thereafter. The patient’s wife then asks about organ donation, observing that the patient had long expressed an interest in organ donation and was registered with the Department of Motor Vehicles as an organ donor.\n\n【3】 Is it ethically and morally permissible to discontinue this patient’s life support, knowing that he will die as a result? If so, how should such a decision be made?\n\n【4】 Would the analysis be different if the patient did not need a ventilator but only was receiving tube feedings?\n\n【5】 Would the analysis be different if the patient was in a coma and lacked all brainstem reflexes, including the drive to breathe?\n\n【6】 Can this patient be an organ donor?\n\n【7】### ANSWERS TO CASE 28:\n\n【8】#### End-of-Life Ethics\n\n【9】Summary : A previously healthy man has experienced a devastating brain injury as a result of an intracerebral hemorrhage. Medical providers and surrogates must make a decision about life-sustaining therapy (LST)—in this case, mechanical ventilation. After a decision is made to withdraw LST, the question of organ donation arises: Can this patient be an organ donor?\n\n【10】 Is it ethically and morally permissible to discontinue life support? It is ethically and morally permissible to withdraw LST from a patient who has lost decisional capacity (or competence) when it is judged that the patient would prefer to forego LST.\n\n【11】 If so, how should such a decision be made? When a previously competent person becomes decisionally incapacitated, clinicians first consult any specific advance directives the patient made, and then ask a designated health care proxy to exercise substituted judgment on the patient’s behalf. When no clear answer can be arrived at with these standards, the best interests standard is used.\n\n【12】 Analysis if the patient did not need a ventilator but only tube feedings : Tube feedings, whether administered through a nasogastric tube or a gastric tube, are considered medical therapies. As such, patients have a right to refuse them, and incapacitated patients can refuse tube feeding by way of advance directives, substituted judgment, or a best-interests analysis.\n\n【13】 Would the analysis be different if the patient was in a coma and lacked all brainstem reflexes, including the drive to breathe? In this case, the patient would be considered dead as measured by brain death criteria. In this case, physicians would not be obliged to continue LST, and the patient would be legally declared dead.\n\n【14】 Can this patient be an organ donor? If the patient were brain dead, then he might be a so-called heart-beating donor. If not brain dead, then he might be able to donate using donation after cardiac death (DCD) protocols, whereby his ventilator support is withdrawn, physicians wait for his heart to stop, and then organs are procured for transplantation. Eligibility to donate also depends on consent, either from the patient or a surrogate, and also requires that there not be any contraindications (eg, some infections, some types of cancer).\n\n【15】### ANALYSIS\n\n【16】##### Objectives\n\n【17】1\\.

Because he cannot make decisions for himself, a process of decision-making must be followed. If he had any advance directives that specifically addressed his situation, then these would take highest priority in estimating what should be done. If there are no advance directives that help with the decision, then health care proxies must be asked to exercise substituted judgment on his behalf in an effort to make the decision he would have made. If neither advance directives nor someone who could exercise substituted judgment was available, then a decision must be made about what is in the patient’s best interests, all things considered. In all such cases, it can be very helpful to enlist the aid of ethics consultants and others who can help direct the decision-making process in a fair and unbiased manner.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The delivery was complicated by massive hemorrhage. She desires to breast-feed， but her breast milk has not come in (normally it begins 24-48 hours postpartum). She breast-fed all of her other children without delay. In addition， she complains of intense fatigue， mental sluggishness，lightheadedness， and a racing heartbeat. On physical examination she is pale， diaphoretic， and weak. Vital signs are as follows： temperature 36.2℃ (97.1°F)； pulse 100/min supine， 115/min sitting， and 130/min standing； and blood pressure 90/70 mm Hg supine，80/60 mm Hg sitting， and 70/50 mm Hg standing.\n\n【2】What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【3】Sheehan syndrome. What is the likely cause? This patient's massive hemorrhage during pregnancy likely led to ischemia and necrosis of the pituitary gland. What hormones are secreted by the pituitary gland? The pituitary gland can be separated into anterior and posterior components. The anterior pituitary(adenohypophysis) is derived from ectoderm and produces follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)， luteinizing hormone (LH)， adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)， growth hormone， thyroid-stimulating hormone， melanotropin， and prolactin. (Know the role of each of these hormones.) The posterior component(neurohypophysis) is derived from neuroectoderm and produces antidiuretic hormone and oxytocin. Oxytocin is required for lactation and contraction of the uterus. What are the clinical manifestations of this condition? The presentation can be broken down into deficiencies of each of the pituitary hormones. Severe presentations can present within the first days to weeks of delivery with profound lethargy， anorexia， weight loss， cardiovascular instability， and inability to lactate. Less severe cases may present months to years after the event with hypothyroidism， menstrual irregularities， and other hormonal disturbances.\n\n【4】What is the significance of the patient's vital signs?\n\n【5】The patient displays orthostatic hypotension， defined as a systolic blood pressure decrease of at least 20mm Hg systolic (or a diastolic blood pressure decrease of 10 mm Hg) within 3 minutes of standing. There is a compensatory increase in heart rate to maintain peripheral perfusion. The cause of hypotension in this patient is loss of cortisol， which is required for maintenance of peripheral vascular tone. This is a medical emergency， as the patient is at risk for vascular collapse.\n\n【6】What other laboratory abnormalities can be expected in this patient?\n\n【7】Hyponatremia and hyperkalemia， due to loss of ACTH (secondary hypoaldosteronism)， hypocortisolism， hypothyroidism， and FSH and LH deficiency are all seen.

Examination of the sputum revealed the presence of acid-fast bacilli. Which of the following would confirm a diagnosis of tuberculosis?\n\n【1】A. Inclusion bodies of the nuclei of macrophages\n\n【2】B. Presence of gram-positive pleomorphic organisms\n\n【3】C. Rough, nonpigmented colonies\n\n【4】D. Rapid growth on Lowenstein-Jensen medium\n\n【5】Answer: 14.1 C. To mount a protective immune response against a specific microorganism requires that the appropriate population of cells play a role in the response. A lipoprotein of M. tuberculosis stimulates a specific “toll-like receptor” on the macrophage. Activated macrophages then synthesize IL-12, which causes differentiation of naïve helper T cells into the Th-1 type of helper T cells that participates in the cell-mediated (delayed hypersensitivity) response. In addition, delayed hypersensitivity (not humoral) reactions are produced against antigens of intracellular pathogens such as M. tuberculosis . Thus, humoral immunity is not protective against M. tuberculosis , and the patient will experience severe tuberculosis if cell-mediated immunity is not functional. Therefore, an agglutination test for antibodies is useless, as M. tuberculosis is an intracellular pathogen and will not elicit a humoral (antibody-formation) immune response that will protect the patient against M. tuberculosis . The growth is usually slow, and the colonies are rough and nonpigmented.\n\n【6】Question: 14.2 A 45-year-old traveler discovers that he has converted from negative to positive on the tuberculin (PPD) skin test.

He is most likely to be infected with an “atypical” Mycobacterium .\n\n【10】D. He needs to be immediately isolated to prevent spread of M. tuberculosis .\n\n【11】E. He will eventually develop tuberculosis.\n\n【12】Answer: 14.2 B. The PPD skin test, or tuberculin skin test, contains several proteins from M. tuberculosis , which when combined with waxes elicits a delayed hypersensitivity. It does not assess for the status of infection, but only speaks about prior exposure. The clinical presentation, findings on chest radiography, or both would be the next steps in evaluation.\n\n【13】Question: 14.3 A 60-year-old man with a chronic cough, bloody sputum, and marked weight loss is diagnosed as having tuberculosis.

Her examination is nonspecific and shows sluggish miotic pupils. Her blood pressure is low， and her respiratory rate is slow. Her roommate says the patient \"has been doing drugs， and the drug screen is positive for opiates. While the differential diagnosis of stupor is broad， many signs point toward an acute opiate intoxication. Sadly， this patient's presenta-tion is all too common， since opioid use disorder has become an epidemic and is associated with a large number of deaths. The most important immediate interven-tion is respiratory support， since respiratory depression is the most common cause of death. Her oxygen saturation should be assessed， and ventilation should be pro-vided using bag/mask for hypoxemia and/or a respiratory rate below 12/minute. Nalaxone， a competitive mu opioid receptor antagonist should be administered parenterally.\n\n【20】APPROACH TO：Opiate Overdose\n\n【21】DEFINITIONS\n\n【22】COMA： A state in which an individual is unarousable and unresponsive.\n\n【23】DRUG ADDICTION： Neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by a recurring desire to continue taking the drug despite harmful consequences， or engagement in illegal or criminal activities in order to obtain access to such a drug.\n\n【24】OPIATE： A drug containing or derived from opium. It can be natural， semisyn-thetic， or synthetic.\n\n【25】STUPOR： A state between alertness and comatose， with an alert patient being arousable.\n\n【26】SUBSTANCE DEPENDENCE： Physiopharmacologic term that implies that the body has adapted to a substance， so its absence leads to some form of withdrawal syndrome.\n\n【27】SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER： According to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5)， it is defined as a problematic pattern of use of a substance leading to clinically significant impairment or distress， manifested within a 12-month period. The manifestations can include the following： strong urges； preoccupation with use； a reduction in social， occupational， or recreational activities； and more. Depending on the number of the diagnostic criteria met， a severity of mild， moderate， or severe is assigned.\n\n【28】CLINICAL APPROACH\n\n【29】Pathophysiology\n\n【30】Substance use disorder is a significant source of morbidity and mortality in the United States and throughout the world. Opioids continue to rise as a cause of drug overdoses， and an increasing amount of prescription opioids are involved. Due to this phenomenon， chronic opioid dependence to acute opioid toxicity as in this case are all part of the spectrum of pathology that can result from opioid use.\n\n【31】Opioids have central nervous system depressant and analgesic effects and can create a feeling of euphoria as well. The receptors for opioids are located in the cen-tral and peripheral nervous systems and include mu， kappa， and delta. Stimulation of mu receptors in the central nervous system results in responses such as respiratory depression， analgesia， euphoria， and miosis. Cough suppression and constipation can result from activation of peripheral mu-opioid receptors located in the smooth muscle of the bronchi and intestines， respectively.\n\n【32】Diagnosis. The history， physical examination， and routine and toxicologic labora-tory evaluations are used to establish and confirm acute opioid toxicity. When 删除换行1 approaching a stuporous patient， it is important to be methodical： Think first of the conditions for which an early diagnosis modifies the outcome. Such is the case for hypoglycemia， meningoencephalitis (needing a lumbar puncture)， and some types of cerebrovascular accidents. As a rule of thumb， any other diag-nosis allows clinicians to select tests appropriate to historical and exam-based features.\n\n【33】As soon as the patient presents， particularly if altered from an unknown drug， a rapid screening examination should be completed to determine if any imme-diate steps are needed to stabilize the patient. Vital signs should be measured， mental status should be assessed， and pupil size should be measured. Skin mois-ture should be assessed， and a thorough skin examination should be conducted to identify any stigmata of drug use (eg， needle tracks or presence of skin-based drug delivery such as a fentanyl patch). Pulse oximetry， continuous cardiac moni-toring， and an electrocardiogram should be obtained. Intravenous access with large-bore catheters and a finger-stick blood glucose measurement should be obtained as well.\n\n【34】If unable to obtain a history from the patient， any information about known current medications or possible ingestion or substance consumed from a bystander or someone familiar with the patient would be helpful.\n\n【35】Differential Diagnosis. Table 60-1 offers a nonexhaustive differential diagnosis of stupor. A plethora of drugs that can result in stupor or coma need to be con-sidered. Some of them cause distinct physical examination findings supporting alternative diagnoses. Antihistamines， antipsychotics，barbiturates， beta-adrenergic antagonists， carbon monoxide， cholinergics， clonidine， cyclic antidepressants， etha-nol， toxic alcohols such as methanol or ethylene glycol， organophosphates and sym-patholytics represent some examples of drugs that can impair the brain function.\n\n【36】Laboratory Tests. A finger-stick serum glucose concentration should be quickly obtained since hypoglycemia， which can be rapidly detected and corrected， may otherwise obfuscate the differential of opioid toxicity. All patients should have a urinalysis and serum chemistries evaluated， including electrolytes， blood urea nitrogen (BUN)， creatinine， and glucose. Serum creatine kinase， liver function tests， lipase， ionized calcium， magnesium， arterial blood gas， serum osmolality， and serum lactate can also be tested. Urine pregnancy testing should always be obtained in any woman of childbearing age.\n\n【37】Some drug levels can be measured； such is the case of acetaminophen， alcohol， aspirin， and lithium. Salicylate concentration need not be obtained in the absence of elevated respiratory rate or high anion gap metabolic acidosis.\n\n【38】Other Tests. Other studies should be based on the known history and tailored to each patient's presentation. This includes thyroid function tests， blood cultures， a chest x-ray， and brain imaging studies. An electrocardiogram may provide useful information， such as the duration of the QRS and QTc intervals， which could be modified by loperamide or methadone， respectively.\n\n【39】Special Considerations. A urine toxicologic screen is not always necessary but may be helpful. Acute opioid toxicity is a clinical diagnosis； importantly， if the clini-cal characteristics are present， the management of a patient with an opioid toxicity would not change if a urine opioid screen is negative. A positive test demonstrates\n\n| Table 60-1·CAUSES OF STUPOR  |\n| --- |\n| Space-Occupying Lesions ·Vascular ·Cerebral hematoma ·Extracerebral hematoma (trauma or spontaneous) Tumors ·Metastatic ·Primary ·Infections · Abscess and cerebritis .Echinococcosis ·Toxoplasmosis  |\n| Cerebral Infarction Thrombotic ·Embolic ·Venous occlusion  |\n| Diffuse or Metabolic 。Infection ·Brain dysfunction in sepsis·Meningoencephalitis ·Status epilepticus ·Anoxia Hypoglycemia ·Selective hypovitaminosis ·Hepatic encephalopathy ·Uremia Dialysis disequilibrium syndrome ·Hypothyroidism Hypercarbia ·Hypothermia ·Hyponatremia ·Hypercalcemia  |\n| Psychiatric Causes ·Schizophrenia with stupor ·Affective disorder with stupor ·Dissociative stupor ·Hysterical stupor  |\n\n【41】recent use but does not confirm toxicity. Many opioids， especially the synthetic formulations， will produce a false-negative result in several available urine drug screens.\n\n【42】Clinical Presentation\n\n【43】The physical examination findings of opioid toxicity can include the following changes in vital signs： bradypnea， bradycardia， hypotension， and hypothermia. A common finding in opioid toxicity is respiratory depression. Hypoactive bowel sounds may be noted， and the patient may present comatose or with seizure. While miosis is characteristic， its absence or even the presence of mydriasis does not 删除换行1 preclude opiate toxicity but could instead suggest co-ingestion of other drugs. The mental status of a patient presenting with opioid toxicity can range from euphoric to comatose.\n\n【44】Persistent immobility in the patient with stupor can lead to compressed fascia-bound muscle groups， resulting in compartment syndrome and rhabdo-myolysis； the myoglobin released from injured muscle can precipitate in the renal tubules， leading to acute kidney injury.\n\n【45】Treatment\n\n【46】The initial management is focused on addressing the patient's airway， breathing， and circulation and providing support to these systems if needed. Pulse oximetry may measure oxygenation but cannot determine the presence of hypercapnia. An arte-rial blood gas measurement may be needed.\n\n【47】The most significant therapeutic decision to make is the administration of naloxone； the success of this intervention also confirms the diagnosis of opioid toxicity. Naloxone is a short-acting opioid antagonist. It can be dosed starting at0.04 mg intravenously； for patients presenting with apnea or cardiopulmonary arrest， at least 2 mg are usually necessary. Bradypneic patients should be venti-lated by a bag valve mask attached to supplemental oxygen before and after nal-oxone administration to reduce the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome. The dose should be increased every few minutes until the respiratory rate is12 breaths/min or greater. The goal is to achieve adequate ventilation and not necessarily to normalize consciousness.\n\n【48】Naloxone can also be given intramuscularly， subcutaneously， or even intrana-sally if intravenous access cannot be obtained， but with these routes absorption is delayed and titration is difficult. As long as symptoms of opioid withdrawal are not present， more naloxone can be given， but after administration of 5 to 10 mg with-out a clinical response， the diagnosis should be reconsidered.\n\n【49】If opioid withdrawal occurs， the patient should be managed symptomatically and not by administration of more opioids. One important consideration in opioid toxicity as opposed to other drug toxicities is that activated charcoal and gastric emptying are never an appropriate management decision and are only considered if there is a strong suspicion for co-ingestion of other drugs.\n\n【50】Prevention. Most patients with acute opioid toxicity can be cared for in the emergency department without hospital admission， assuming there is no other medical issue of concern. Psychiatric evaluation can be done once respirations and mental status are normal. For patients with features consistent with addic-tion， rehabilitation is indicated. Teaching opioid users， family members， and friends how to recognize opioid toxicity and prescribing them naloxone reduces mortality.\n\n【51】Detoxification or supervised opioid withdrawal is the first step in treatment and reduces withdrawal symptoms. Medication is typically needed to prevent relapse. Naltrexone， which is an opioid antagonist， is a possible treatment， but it should be started after opioid withdrawal is thoroughly completed. Other treatments， such as methadone and buprenorphine， which are opioid agonists， can be started while a patient is still using opioids.\n删除16：<u>CASE CORRELATION\n删除25：<u>See also Case 36 (Transient Ischemic Attack)， Case 41 (Urinary Tract Infection With Sepsis in the Elderly)， Case 43 (Meningitis， Bacterial)， and Case 59 (Delirium/Alcohol Withdrawal).</u>\n</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

In this procedure the patient's blood is repeat-60， edly removed 300-500 ml at a time and the blood is centrifuged (in this case at 37°C， at which temperature the IgM antibodies would be eluted from the red blood cells). The cells are resuspended in normal plasma and infused back into the patient.

Due to deficiency of this enzyme alpha oxidation does not take place and beta oxidation cannot proceed as usual resulting in accumulation of phytanic acid in various organs.\n\n【11】In Refsum's disese it is not the beta oxidation which is at fault， rather it is alpha oxidation which is defective as one of the enzymes of alpha oxidation known as phytanic acid alpha oxidase/phytanic acid alpha hydroxylase is deficient.\n\n【12】Clinically， it is manifested by mental and growth retardation， facial dysmorphism， hepatomegaly， severe sensorineural deafness， atypical retinitis pigmentosa，peripheral neuropathy， cerebellar ataxia， and high concentrations of protein in CSF.\n\n【13】A.2. Phytanic acid is exogenous， milk and dairy products are primary source of phytanic acid. It is also found abundantly in plants but not available for absorption from these sources as chlorophyll make insoluble complex which prevents its absorption from gastrointestinal lumen.\n\n【14】A.3. Currently symptomatic management is done. There is no cure to this disease till date.\n删除16：<u>Bibllography\n\n【15】1\\. Marano R， Soliveri P， Garavaglia B， et al.

This specimen is taken from the patient’s substantia nigra and demonstrates a typical melanin-containing neuron with pink-staining inclusions known as Lewy bodies. Lewy bodies are aggregations of the protein α-synuclein that are seen primarily in two neurologic diseases: Parkinson disease and Lewy body dementia. This patient’s symptoms are characteristic of Parkinson disease, and this answer choice describes the process underlying this disease. Other common symptoms of Parkinson disease are cogwheel rigidity, postural instability, micrographia, and masked facies.  \nAnswer A is incorrect . The pathology described in this answer choice is characteristic of Alzheimer disease, the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. This answer choice can be definitively ruled out, because Alzheimer disease is not associated with Lewy bodies.  \nAnswer B is incorrect . The pathology described in this answer choice is consistent with Wilson disease, an autosomal recessive defect in copper transport that leads to the accumulation of copper in tissues. Wilson disease can be associated with parkinsonian symptoms, as well as chorea, psychiatric symptoms, liver disease, and the characteristic Kayser-Fleischer ring. Although some aspects of this answer choice are possible, this patient’s symptoms are most consistent with Parkinson disease. Furthermore, Wilson disease is not associated with Lewy bodies.  \nAnswer C is incorrect . This answer choice describes the pathologic process associated with Huntington disease, an autosomal dominant disease caused by a trinucleotide repeat on chromosome 4. Huntington disease is commonly associated with chorea, athetosis, and changes in personality. This disease generally presents in the third to fifth decades and is not associated with Lewy bodies.  \nAnswer E is incorrect . This answer choice is likely referring to metastatic melanoma of the brain. This choice may be appealing because of the pigmentation of the histology shown in the image.

The authors defined a new classification of heart failure based on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), describing normal or less than normal ejection fraction (EF) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Patient reported symptoms and clinical manifestations of heart failure are similar regardless of their ejection fraction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The underlying pathophysiology of the subtypes of heart failure is vastly different and dictates the evaluation and ultimately the treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Patients with risk factors should be screened periodically by their primary care providers for clinical symptoms associated with heart failure. Mild myocardial dysfunction and structural changes can exist for years without being clinically detected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. A comprehensive clinical history and symptom assessment is essential because early recognition and intervention can prevent adverse outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association developed a staging system for heart failure through which most patients will progress during the course of the disease process 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Disease progression through the heart failure stages can be delayed and perhaps prevented, but generally, not reversed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Once structural disease has been established, there is rarely a mechanism for complete correction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Progression from one stage to the next is clinically relevant as it is associated with a reduction in overall survival  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\nTable 3.1 删除换行 ACC/AHA stages of heart failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>\n\n| Stage  | Definition  | Examples  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| A  | At risk for heart failure: no structural changes/functional heart disease or abnormal biomarkers and no past or present signs and symptoms of heart failure  | • Hypertension • Diabetes/metabolic syndrome • Obesity • Atherosclerotic vascular disease • Substance abusers (alcohol, illicit drugs) • Family history of cardiomyopathy • Exposure to cardiotoxic agents  |\n| B  | Pre-heart failure: structural heart changes or evidence of increased filling pressures but no signs or symptoms of heart failure  | • Previous MI • Left ventricular hypertrophy/remodeling • Valvular disease  |\n| C  | Symptomatic heart failure: patients with current or previous symptoms/signs of HF  | • Heart failure signs and symptoms • Symptoms of heart failure at rest/activity despite guideline directed medical therapy  |\n| D  | Advanced heart failure: refractory, end stage heart failure  | • Marked heart failure symptoms at all times • Recurrent hospitalizations and decompensations  |\n\n【16】Cardiomyopathies are defined as changes in the myocardium secondary to metabolic, mechanical, or electrical dysfunction within the heart 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Cardiomyopathies can be classified into three main subgroups with the different etiologies falling into one of these categories  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 4 , 6 \\]</u>.\nTable 3.2 删除换行 Three major cardiomyopathy categories and most common etiologies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 4 , 6 \\]</u>\n\n| Cardiomyopathy  | Common etiologies  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Dilated cardiomyopathy  | • Idiopathic • Peripartum • Ischemic • Infectious (viral, bacterial, parasitic) • Alcohol, illicit substances, toxins • Chronic persistent tachycardia-(metabolic) • Developmental (such as non-compaction) or familial (for example, arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia) • Autoimmune • Valvular (mitral or aortic regurgitation)  |\n| Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy  | • Longstanding, persistent hypertension • Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy • Small vessel disease from diabetes mellitus  |\n| Restrictive or infiltrative cardiomyopathy  | • Amyloidosis • Sarcoidosis • Hemochromatosis • Scleroderma  |\n\n【18】There may be an overlap within these subtypes. For example, both amyloidosis and longstanding uncontrolled hypertension can present as dilated cardiomyopathies. Valvular disease can present as dilated cardiomyopathy or restrictive depending on the specific lesion.\n\n【19】3.2 History: Etiology and Precipitating Factors of Heart Failure\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】### 3.2.1 Risk Factors\n\n【21】It is important to assess all common risk factors associated with the development of heart failure. This history section will give a closer look into the topics that are imperative to consider when gathering a history for someone who is suspected of having heart failure.\n\n【22】Early identification and modification of risk factors can prevent the development and progression of heart failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Some of the most common risk factors that lead to the development of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction include advancing age, obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, and alcohol or illicit substance use 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. This section will review factors that are important to consider when taking a history of a patient suspected of having heart failure.\n\n【23】### 3.2.2 Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)\n\n【24】Myocardial ischemia should be considered in all patients presenting with new onset of heart failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 4 , 6 \\]</u>. Approximately 50% of patients diagnosed with heart failure have an underlying ischemic cardiomyopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Patients with a new diagnosis of heart failure should be assessed for signs and symptoms of CAD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 4 , 5 , 7 \\]</u>. Risk factors should be addressed and signs/symptoms evaluated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】### 3.2.3 Valvular Heart Disease\n\n【26】Mitral regurgitation (MR) is a frequent cause of heart failure which may be the result of a structurally abnormal valve (primary) or due to annular dilatation with incomplete coaptation of the valve leaflets (secondary or functional MR) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. A history of rheumatic fever should prompt consideration of valvular heart disease. Aortic stenosis may be due to a congenital defect (bicuspid aortic valve) or degenerative (calcific) disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 , 9 \\]</u>. Endocarditis may cause severe valve dysfunction and is a particular concern in patients with a history of intravenous drug abuse or an indwelling catheter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【27】### 3.2.4 Hypertension\n\n【28】Patients with a longstanding history of persistent or untreated hypertension are at an increased risk for developing a hypertensive cardiomyopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. These hearts remodel due to the longstanding increased afterload by increasing LV wall thickness and mass 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. They develop restrictive filling and may manifest as heart failure with preserved EF (HFpEF) as the disease progresses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】### 3.2.5 Endocrine\n\n【30】Numerous endocrine conditions are associated with LV dysfunction and heart failure. Diabetes mellitus (DM) (Types 1 and 2), hypo or hyperthyroidism, growth hormone excess, pheochromocytoma, hyperaldosteronism, and Cushing’s syndrome are all potential causes of LV dysfunction and heart failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 4 , 10 \\]</u>. Patients who have diabetes mellitus are prone to developing coronary artery disease and resultant myocardial ischemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 11 \\]</u>. DM is also a risk factor for the development of HFpEF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 12 \\]</u>. Uncontrolled diabetics tend to have more frequent heart failure decompensations due to hyperosmolar stress and increased infection risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 11 , 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】### 3.2.6 Pregnancy\n\n【32】Heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction can occur in both the peripartum and postpartum phases of pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 13 , 14 \\]</u>. If it occurs within the first year after the delivery of a child, it is termed postpartum cardiomyopathy. These women tend to have no history of prior heart disease or peripartum preeclampsia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 13 , 14 \\]</u>. Women with peripartum cardiomyopathies frequently recover within the first 6 months. Those who do not recover are advised against additional pregnancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 13 , 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【33】### 3.2.7 Family History/Genetics\n\n【34】Approximately 10–15% of heart failure patients have a genetic mutation likely to be related to their cardiomyopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 – 4 \\]</u>. Heritable cardiomyopathies include hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, Fabry’s disease, or muscular dystrophies including the laminopathies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 – 18 \\]</u>. It is very important for those who have a family history of sudden cardiac death to have a cardiac evaluation as well as genetic testing if indicated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Hereditary TTR amyloid is due to a genetic mutation, which regulates the metabolism and structure of transthyretin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. It is important for family members of affected individuals to undergo genetic testing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 16 \\]</u>.\n\n【35】### 3.2.8 Illicit Substances and Toxic Agents (Chemotherapy, Drugs, Alcohol)\n\n【36】A crucial part of history taking for newly identified cardiomyopathies is to identify past and present alcohol consumption and/or illicit drug use 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. Alcohol is directly cardiotoxic and chronic consumption of excessive alcohol can cause an alcohol-induced cardiomyopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 19 \\]</u>. Similarly, drug-induced cardiomyopathies are seen with long-term methamphetamine, cocaine, and other stimulant use, which can directly cause myocardial remodeling and dysfunction, as well as induce LV dysfunction through coronary artery disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 , 19 \\]</u>. There is about a 35% chance that a cardiomyopathy due to excessive alcohol consumption will resolve if the patient can abstain from drinking 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Chapter 16 of this book delves further into a review of alcohol and drug inducted cardiomyopathies.\n\n【37】Chemotherapy agents pose a significant risk for both acute and chronic myocardial damage. Some commonly used drugs that contribute to myocardial dysfunction are anthracyclines (such as doxorubicin or Adriamycin) or cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 4 , 19 \\]</u>. Comorbidities such as advanced age, preexisting heart disease, or prior radiation increase the risks associated with chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 19 \\]</u>. Cardiotoxicity may be a direct effect of the drug (for example, anthracyclines, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, or monoclonal antibodies) or a secondary effect from vascular damage and cardiac ischemia (fluorouracil) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. Some chemotherapy agents can cause cardiac arrhythmias, myocarditis, or pericarditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are monoclonal antibodies, which target host immune regulation receptors and can precipitate acute myocarditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 , 21 \\]</u>.\n\n【38】### 3.2.9 Myocarditis\n\n【39】Acute myocarditis may be a result of a viral infection (SARS COVID-19 or more traditional viruses) or an inflammatory process (giant cell myocarditis or sarcoidosis) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 20 – 23 \\]</u>. Most viral myocarditis cases are sequelae from upper respiratory or gastrointestinal illnesses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 , 23 \\]</u>. It is important to establish the connection with a prior viral illness as it may allow for more direct serologic testing and specific diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. Evidence of myocardial inflammation has been found in 2–3% of college athletes recovering from COVID infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 \\]</u>. There have been rare case reports of mostly younger adults with myocarditis or pericarditis associated with the mRNA vaccines with reports of four to five cases per one million vaccinations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 \\]</u>. Approximately 50% of patient with an acute viral myocarditis will recover their cardiac function within 6–12 months of their index diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. HIV, parasites, Chagas, bacterial, and fungal infections can also cause acute myocarditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 20 \\]</u>.\n\n【40】### 3.2.10 Connective Tissue and Systemic Disorders\n\n【41】Autoimmune diseases which can lead to cardiomyopathies include systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, and polymyositis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 4 \\]</u>. These patients will often present with heart failure in the setting of preserved left ventricular function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【42】### 3.2.11 Anemia\n\n【43】Anemia is a highly correctable cause of heart failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 26 \\]</u>. Anemia secondary to iron deficiency is a common condition that can cause heart failure exacerbations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 26 \\]</u>. It is important to evaluate and treat the underlying etiology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 26 , 27 \\]</u>. Untreated severe anemia causes increased myocardial oxygen demand as well as increases peripheral tissue oxygen demand to meet metabolic oxygen requirements 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 26 \\]</u>.\n\n【44】### 3.2.12 Nutritional Deficiencies\n\n【45】Nutritional deficits such as thiamine deficiency can lead to the development of a dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 28 , 29 \\]</u>. Thiamine insufficiency can occur among individuals who are on fad diets, as well as those who have prolonged hospitalizations with inadequate nutritional support 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 28 , 29 \\]</u>. There are two types of thiamine deficiency: dry beriberi and wet beriberi. Dry beriberi manifests as primarily neurological complications, whereas wet beriberi involves cardiac deficits 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 28 , 29 \\]</u>. The cardiovascular complications with wet beriberi include low cardiac output failure, systemic vasodilation, peripheral edema, and fluid retention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 28 , 29 \\]</u>. The focus of management for thiamine deficient patients with heart failure needs to be normalization of this nutritional abnormality with adequate supplementation of thiamine, which is available in both intravenous and oral formulations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 28 \\]</u>.\n\n【46】### 3.2.13 Arrhythmias\n\n【47】Patients with incessant, uncontrolled tachycardias can develop a dilated cardiomyopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. It is typically the supraventricular tachycardias such as uncontrolled atrial fibrillation or flutter that lead to cardiac remodeling 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 30 , 31 \\]</u>. Ventricular tachycardia can occur in patients with dilated cardiomyopathies and heart failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Persistent frequent ventricular ectopy is associated with LV dysfunction. Patients with tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathies often have reversibility of their cardiac dysfunction if successfully controlled 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 5 , 12 , 30 , 31 \\]</u>.\n\n【48】### 3.2.14 Idiopathic\n\n【49】After a comprehensive medical work-up is completed, there are still times when a definitive etiology or causative factor cannot be identified 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. These cases are termed idiopathic cardiomyopathies and account for 10–20% of all heart failure cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【50】In summary, an all-inclusive health history is essential in the setting of any new heart failure diagnosis. Subsequent history taking at all future clinic visits should be completed to ensure the patient’s heart failure is controlled and properly treated in order to prevent future exacerbations.\n\n【51】3.3 History: Symptoms of Heart Failure\n--------------------------------------\n\n【52】An all-inclusive history of symptoms is essential to make a prompt diagnosis of heart failure.

As the (male) provider is taking the patient's history， he notices that the patient is frequently reaching across the desk to touch his arm as he talks to her， as well as leaning forward in her seat to be nearer to him. She expresses her gratitude in his listening to her. Which of the following responses is the most appropriate response from the provider during this interview?\n\n【7】Tell the patient to stop touching him immediately.\n\n【8】Move his seat further from the patient so that she cannot reach him.\n\n【9】Tell the patient that she will be referred to a female provider.\n\n【10】D.

The patient is spend-ing a great deal more time alone in her bedroom， she doesn’t seem to be caring for her hygiene as well as usual， and has been missing work a great deal more. She is very clingy and attention seeking with her mother. Which of the fol-lowing diagnoses best fits this patient's presentation?\nA. Histrionic personality disorder\n\n【13】B.

Substance use is a common feature of Cluster B personality disorders. Significant changes in usual behavior， alienation from loved ones， and physical signs are common features. Often patients are reluctant to admit use， so a urine toxicology is a reasonable next step to plan an appropriate inter-vention. There is no evidence for need to break confidentiality (answer A) at this stage； such reasons include plans for self-harm or harm of others. Answer C (no further evaluation and continuing psychotherapy) may lead to serious problems for the patient if drug use is undetected； additionally， a missed substance abuse diagnosis would decrease the effectiveness of the behavioral therapy. Referring the patient to her primary care physician(answer D) would most likely lead to the patient's not following up and would also cause disruption in the care of her personality disorder.Refer-ring her to an Alcoholics Anonymous group (answer E) without evidence or confirmation of substance abuse would be viewed negatively by the patient and is not indicated.\n\n【22】52.2 D. Histrionic patients often display inappropriate or seductive behavior. This is best managed by being tactful and sympathetic to the patient， but firmly and clearly placing boundaries on such behavior. Answer A (tell the patient to stop touching him immediately) is abrupt and may be harsh. Answer B (move his seat further from the patient so that she cannot reach him) is indirect and does not address the issue. Answer C (tell the patient that she will be referred to a female provider) may be viewed as rejection 删除换行1 by the patient， but this may be required if the attempt at setting boundar-ies is unsuccessful. Answer E (tell the patient he understands her gratitude in this situation) may only encourage the same behavior. Thus， affirming the patient and providing support， yet also drawing firm boundaries， is the best action.\n\n【23】52.3 D. This patient has a new onset of behavior that is unlike her usual personal-ity. These behaviors are common in major depression. The clinician might also look into other symptoms of major depression including appetite prob-lems， sleep disturbances， tearfulness， and thoughts of self-harm.\n\n【24】52.4 B. Patients with histrionic personality disorder most often demonstrate emotional lability. Grandiosity (answer E) is seen in antisocial personalities and narcissistic personalities， cognitive dysregulation (answer D) is seen in borderline and schizotypal personality disorders， recklessness (answer C) in antisocial and borderline， and callousness (answer A) in antisocial personality disorders.\n\n【25】CLINICAL PEARLS\n\n【26】Patients with histrionic personality disorder often appear very dramatic and overemotional. They do not seem to have much depth in either their emotions or their relationships with others. They are uncomfortable when they are not the center of attention.\n\n【27】Comorbidity includes other Cluster B personality disorders， major depres-sion， somatization disorder， and conversion disorder.\n\n【28】Patients with histrionic personality disorder use the defense mechanisms of dissociation and repression most commonly.\n\n【29】When interacting with these patients， the clinician should use a low-key， friendly approach but should watch interpersonal boundaries. Clear limit setting or boundary setting interventions may be needed early in the therapeutic process.\n\n【30】Patients with histrionic personality disorder can be differentiated from those with mania because the latter often develop dramatic， seductive symptoms as new-onset behavior， not as a pervasive pattern. Patients with mania commonly also have vegetative symptoms， such as a decreased need for sleep， and psychotic symptoms as well.\n\n【31】Borderline personality disordered patients display a wide array of impul-sive behaviors， including self-harm， as well as chronic feelings of empti-ness that are not present in those with histrionic personality disorders.\n\n【32】Those with narcissistic personality disorders may display attention-seeking behavior， as they want to be perceived as \"superior\" or better than others； histrionic personality disordered patients do not mind appearing weak or fragile if this will get them the attention they crave.\n删除20：<u>American Psychiatric Association.

The part should be protected from exposure to 删除换行1 cold.\n\n【4】4. Occupational exposure should be reduced.\n\n【5】5. A variety of vasodilator drugs have been used in  删除换行1 this condition. But unfortunately only 40% to 60% of  删除换行1 patients respond to these drugs. In many cases the attacks  删除换行1 continue and the drug response is only reduction in  删除换行1 frequency or severity of the attacks without complete  删除换行1 amelioration of the syndrome. Side effects are also not  删除换行1 uncommon with these drugs. Reserpine is the most widely  删除换行1 used drug in this group. An oral dose of 0.25 to 0.50 mg  删除换行1 daily should be prescribed for 2 weeks. Guanethidine is 删除换行1 quite effective in symptomatic treatment of this condition.\nOther adrenergic blocking drugs e.g. priscoline, 删除换行1 phenoxybenzamine and prazocin have been used with good  删除换行1 result.\n\n【6】Calcium channel-blocking drugs which interfere with  删除换行1 inward displacement of calcium ions do have significant  删除换行1 action in the treatment of Raynaud’s syndrome. The effect  删除换行1 of this interference is a reduction in vascular tone with  删除换行1 subsequent vasodilatation. Nifedipine is often the first  删除换行1 choice of many clinicians for the treatment of Raynaud’s  删除换行1 syndrome. It has produced clinical improvement in 50%  删除换行1 to 60% of patients. The combination of nifedipine with  删除换行1 low dose of guanethidine or prazocin has frequently  删除换行1 improved the results of treatment. Nifedipine is known  删除换行1 for its side effects which include headache, flushing,  删除换行1 peripheral oedema, blurr vision etc. the incidence of which  删除换行1 is also diminished in such combination drug treatment.\n\n【7】Thymoxamine acts by competitive antagonism of oc.\n\n【8】adrenoreceptors and block vasoconstriction in the skin.\nIt has low side effects, but incidence of subjective  删除换行1 improvement of symptoms is only 25% to 30%.\n\n【9】Prostaglandin El and prostacyclin are potent  删除换行1 vasodilators and inhibit platelet aggregation. These are  删除换行1 quite effective in severe Raynaud’s syndrome. This is  删除换行1 administered in the trade name of Iloprost as six hours  删除换行1 intravenous infusion at a dose of 2 ng/kg/min. on 3  删除换行1 consecutive days. The dose is reduced to 0.5 ng/kg/min.\nif side effects are noticed in the form of headache,  删除换行1 dizziness, vomiting and diarrhoea.\n\n【10】Ketanserin is a serotonine receptor antagonist which  删除换行1 antagonises serotonine-induced vasoconstriction and  删除换行1 platelet aggregation. Intravenous ketanserin improves  删除换行1 finger blood flow and relieves ischaemic symptoms. Oral  删除换行1 ketanserin is also available, though its effectivity has been  删除换行1 questioned in Raynaud’s syndrome.\n\n【11】TREATMENT.—\n\n【12】There is definitely a place for vascular surgery in cases  删除换行1 of arteriosclerosis, emboli, thoracic outlet syndrome,  删除换行1 aneurysm or trauma which may be associated with  删除换行1 conditions of Raynaud’s syndrome.\n\n【13】Although CERVICO-DORSAL SYMPATHECTOMY \nis recommended for primary Raynaud’s disease, and though  删除换行1 there is good immediate result, yet this is often followed  删除换行1 by gradual recurrence of symptoms. Probably  删除换行1 sympathectomy produces long term good results in mild  删除换行5 Raynaud’s syndrome of the spastic variety and this is the  删除换行1 same group of patients who respond best to drug therapy.\n\n【14】Cervico-dorsal sympathectomy is of little or no benefit  删除换行1 in patients with Raynaud’s syndrome who have associated  删除换行1 connective tissue disease.\n\n【15】Subjective clinical improvement is noted in 60% to  删除换行1 70% of patients immediately after sympathectomy but 删除换行1 after 10 years only 30% to 40% of patients remain  删除换行1 benefited. Sympathectomy is not recommended as a routine  删除换行1 in this condition due to the modest surgical risk, the  删除换行1 expense and the mediocre long term results. It is generally 删除换行1 agreed that sympathectomy should be reserved for patients with 删除换行1 recurrent ulceration of the finger tips or those who are severely 删除换行1 incapacitated by vasospastic phenomena in spite of adequate 删除换行1 medical treatment.\n\n【16】Recently, some surgeons have recommended digital  删除换行1 periarterial sympathectomy as an improved method.\nDirect microvascular bypass of occluded segments of  删除换行1 palmar and digital arteries has also been carried out with  删除换行1 certain relief of symptoms.\n\n【17】CERVICO-THORACiC SYMPATHECTOMY.— In this  删除换行1 technique first, second and third thoracic ganglia are  删除换行1 removed preserving the cervical portion of the stellate  删除换行1 ganglion proximal to the level where the rami  删除换行1 communicantes from the first thoracic nerve join the  删除换行1 ganglion, to avoid Horner’s syndrome. So in this operation  删除换行1 the sympathetic trunk from the lower half of the stellate  删除换行1 ganglion to the just below the 3rd thoracic ganglion  删除换行1 should be resected. As mentioned earlier initial results  删除换行1 are usually good but recurrence of symptoms in  删除换行1 subsequent years is quite common.\n\n【18】Technique of operation.—\n\n【19】Cervico-thoracic sympathectomy can be performed by  删除换行1 one of the three following approaches :—\n\n【20】A. ANTERIOR APPROACH.— An incision is made  删除换行1 about 1/2 inch above the clavicle starting from the lateral  删除换行1 border of the sternal head of the sternomastoid muscle to  删除换行1 the medial border of the trapezius. The phrenic nerve is  删除换行1 safeguarded and the scalenus anterior is divided at its  删除换行1 insertion to the first rib. The subclavian artery is exposed.\nIt is retracted upwards with a sling. Its branches are  删除换行1 carefully safeguarded. The suprapleural membrane is  删除换行1 detached from the inner border of the first rib. The pleura  删除换行1 is pushed downwards and laterally to expose the  删除换行1 sympathetic trunk and the corresponding posterior ends  删除换行1 of the ribs. The sympathetic trunk is divided just below  删除换行1 the 3rd thoracic ganglion. The proximal divided end is  删除换行1 drawn upwards and all the rami communicantes joining  删除换行1 the 3rd and 2nd thoracic ganglia are divided. Finally the  删除换行1 sympathetic trunk is divided just below the level of the  删除换行1 attachment of rami communicantes to the stellate  删除换行1 ganglion. This operation can also be performed above the  删除换行1 subclavian artery, which is probably a better approach  删除换行1 for the short necked patients. But in that case the  删除换行1 thyrocervical trunk should be divided between ligatures  删除换行1 for better exposure.\nB. AXILLARY APPROACH.— An incision, about 5  删除换行1 inches in length, is made on the medial wall of the axilla  删除换行1 along the line of the 2nd intercostal space. The pleuralRAYNAUD’S SYNDROME; BUERGER’S DISEASE, THORACIC OUTLET  删除换行5 cavity is opened and rib-retractor is used. The lung is  删除换行1 drawn downwards and forwards to expose the sympathetic  删除换行1 chain covered with parietal pleura. The pleura is incised  删除换行1 and the sympathetic trunk is removed according to  删除换行1 necessity. The lung is inflated and the wound is closed  删除换行1 with an under-water seal drainage.\n\n【21】C. POSTERIOR APPROACH.— This is probably  删除换行1 the least popular approach for this operation. A vertical  删除换行1 incision is made about 5 cm lateral to the midline keeping  删除换行1 the third rib in the centre. All muscles are divided to  删除换行1 reach the ribs. 5 cm of the posterior end of the 3rd rib  删除换行1 along with the corresponding transverse process is excised  删除换行1 subperiosteally. The sympathetic trunk will be exposed  删除换行1 and excised according to necessity.\n\n【22】Complications.—\n\n【23】1. Main complication is perforation of pleura leading  删除换行1 to pneumothorax.\n\n【24】2. On the left side, lymph fistula due to damage to  删除换行1 the thoracic duct may occur.\n\n【25】3. Horner’s syndrome, which is manifested by ptosis,  删除换行1 myosis, enophthalmos and anhidrosis of that half of the  删除换行1 face, may occur if adequate precaution is not taken.\n\n【26】SYNDROME AND CERVICAL RIB\n\n【27】It is a condition in which there is persistent but  删除换行1 painless cold and cyanosis of the hands and feet. Though  删除换行1 this condition is often confused with Raynaud’s  删除换行1 syndrome, yet the italic words in the first sentence are  删除换行1 the distinguishing features from Raynaud’s syndrome.\nThe basic pathology is the slow rate of blood flow through  删除换行1 the skin due to chronic arteriolar constriction. This results  删除换行1 in a high percentage of reduced haemoglobin in the blood  删除换行1 in the capillaries and this is the cause of cyanotic colour.\nIn some patients endocrine dysfunction has been found.\n\n【28】This condition also affects young women. Coldness  删除换行1 and blueness of the fingers and hands are persistently 删除换行1 present for many years. The extremities are never  删除换行1 completely normal. With heat the colour may change  删除换行1 from deep purple to red. Episodes of blanching (which  删除换行1 is a common feature of Raynaud’s phenomenon) is  删除换行1 absolutely absent in this condition. The peripheral pulses  删除换行1 are usually normal (same as Raynaud’s phenomenon).\nThere are no trophic changes indicative of chronic tissue  删除换行1 ischaemia such as atrophy or sclerosis of the skin or  删除换行1 ulceration.\n\n【29】Treatment.—\n\n【30】Avoidance of cold temperature and reassurance are  删除换行1 often helpful. One may try vasodilator drugs.\n\n【31】If the condition does not respond to above conservative 删除换行1 measures, sympathectomy may be carried out with  删除换行1 reasonably good results.\n\n【32】BUERGER’S DISEASE\n\n【33】(THROMBOANGIITIS OBLITERANS)\n\n【34】This condition was first described by Winiwarter in  删除换行1 1879. Subsequently Leo Buerger first published this  删除换行1 condition in 1908. He proposed the name  删除换行1 thromboangiitis obliterans as he found in histology  删除换行1 thrombosis in both arteries and veins with marked  删除换行1 inflammatory reaction. This classic condition described  删除换行1 by Buerger involves young men with severe ischaemia of  删除换行1 the extremities who are addicted to cigarette smoking  删除换行1 and often have migratory superficial phlebitis. This  删除换行1 condition is quite uncommon and most patients in whom  删除换行1 this diagnosis was made actually suffered from  删除换行1 arteriosclerosis.\n\n【35】Definition.— It is the inflammatory reaction in the  删除换行1 arterial wall with involvement of the neighbouring vein  删除换行1 and nerve, terminating in thrombosis of the artery. Many  删除换行1 cases diagnosed as Buerger’s disease are probably presenile  删除换行1 atherosclerosis occurring in the 3rd, 4th and 5th decades  删除换行1 of the life.\n\n【36】Incidence.— The disease is found more frequently  删除换行1 in men between 20 and 40 years of age. It is uncommon  删除换行1 in women, who constitute only 5% to 10% of all patients  删除换行1 with Buerger’s disease. This is more common in the Jewish  删除换行1 race.\n\n【37】Aetiology.— A specific cause of this disease has never  删除换行1 been found, but interaction of multiple aetiologic factors  删除换行1 have been incriminated.\n\n【38】(i) There is striking association of this disease with  删除换行1 cigarette smoking. Usually 20 or more cigarettes per day  删除换行1 is required for this disease to occur. But it is obvious that  删除换行1 there are so many more smokers than patients with \n\n【39】Buerger’s disease.\n\n【40】(ii) There may be some hormonal influence which  删除换行1 suggests the sex distribution. This disease occurs rarely in  删除换行1 female smokers.\n\n【41】(iii) Patients with Buerger’s disease often come from  删除换行1 lower socio-economic groups and they often have poor  删除换行1 hygiene.\n\n【42】(iv) Fibrinogen level often seems to be elevated in  删除换行1 this condition and a hypercoagulable state has been  删除换行1 postulated. There has also been report of  删除换行1 hyperaggregability of platelets.\n\n【43】(v) Familial predisposition has been reported. A \n\n【44】genetic factor has been suggested by the fact that blacks  删除换行1 are rarely affected; whereas Jewish are more susceptable  删除换行1 to this disease. Later studies however failed to support 删除换行1 this fact.\n\n【45】(vi) Autonomic overactivity has been suggested by a  删除换行1 few pathologists, as there is also sometimes peripheral  删除换行1 vasospasm and hyperhidrosis noticed in this condition.\nIn fact vasospasm, thrombosis and local inflammation  删除换行1 contribute to the development of this disease.\n\n【46】(vii) Recently an autoimmune aetiology has been  删除换行1 postulated. Increase in complement factors and  删除换行1 anticollagen antibody levels have been noticed. There is  删除换行1 also presence of certain human lymphocyte antibodies in  删除换行1 the serum. Both antibodies and lymphocyte-mediated  删除换行1 sensitivity to collagen has been noticed in this condition.\nAntibodies to Rickettsial organisms have also been noticed  删除换行1 in more than 50% of patients.\n\n【47】It appears almost certain that some immunologic  删除换行1 process, potentiated by cigarette smoking plays a major  删除换行1 role in Buerger’s disease.\n\n【48】Pathology.— An obvious inflammatory process  删除换行1 features the Buerger’s disease involving all layers of the  删除换行1 vessel wall. In early stage lymphocytes and fibroblasts  删除换行1 infiltrate the media and adventitia of the artery. Thrombus  删除换行1 is noticed in the lumen of the affected artery. This is also  删除换行1 involved with inflammatory process with multinucleated  删除换行1 giant cells and leukocytes found in the thrombus. There  删除换行1 are also microabscesses within the thrombus. In the late  删除换行1 stage the affected artery becomes occluded and contracted  删除换行1 with marked fibrotic reaction affecting all the layers of  删除换行1 the artery e.g. the adventitia, the media and intima. This 删除换行1 fibrotic process gradually involves the vein and adjacent nerves.\n\n【49】The lesions in Buerger’s disease are segmental and  删除换行1 usually begin in arteries of small and medium size. Both  删除换行1 upper and lower extremities are affected in contrast to  删除换行1 arteriosclerosis which usually spares the upper  删除换行1 extremities. In the lower extremities the disease generally  删除换行1 occurs beyond the popliteal arteries, starting in tibial  删除换行1 arteries extending to the vessels of the foot. In the upper  删除换行1 extremities it is manifested by arterial involvement usually  删除换行1 distal to the forearm in about 30% of patients.\nThromboangiitis has also been described in the G.I. tract,  删除换行1 brain, lungs, heart etc.\n\n【50】Clinical features.— Thromboangiitis obliterans  删除换行1 occurs almost exclusively in males and begins in young  删除换行1 adult life usually between 20 and 35 years of age. One 删除换行1 should always suspect the diagnosis of Buerger’s disease when 删除换行1 a young male smoker presents with peripheral ischaemia, 删除换行1 particularly if the upper extremity is involved and if there is a 删除换行1 history of migratory superficial phlebitis.\n\n【51】The pedal arteries are affected earlier  删除换行1 and the patients complain of pain at the arch of the foot  删除换行1 (foot claudication) while walking. Such pain is somewhat  删除换行1 less common at the calf of the leg and never at the thigh  删除换行1 or buttock (which is common in atherosclerosis). Pain is 删除换行1 typical of intermittent claudication type i.e. pain is  删除换行1 increased when the muscle is exercised and disappears  删除换行1 when the excercise stops.\n\n【52】Intermittent claudication progresses to rest pain.\n\n【53】Gradually postural colour changes appear followed by  删除换行1 trophic changes, eventually ulceration and gangrene of  删除换行1 one or more digits and finally of the entire foot or hand  删除换行1 may take place. In the upper extremity the vessels distal  删除换行1 from the wrist are usually involved so claudication is  删除换行1 almost not complained of in the upper extremity.\n\n【54】Pain in Buerger’s disease is often excruciating. The  删除换行1 clinical picture of Buerger’s disease is protracted and  删除换行1 painful. Some amelioration may be achieved if the patient  删除换行1 ceases smoking and there is also possibility of prolonged  删除换行1 remission if the patient rigidly follows no smoking regime.\nBut most patients are addicted to tobacco and fail to stick  删除换行1 to this regime. These patients have repeated attacks and  删除换行1 may require multiple amputations. When rest pain 删除换行1 develops, it is so intense that the patient cannot sleep. If  删除换行1 the affected limb is kept in dependent position some relief  删除换行1 of pain may be obtained. The limbs become rubor or red  删除换行1 on dependence and pallor on elevation.\n\n【55】One must remember of occasional involvement of  删除换行1 mesenteric or cerebrovascular circulation and symptomps  删除换行1 may be complained of from such involvement.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

He has had numerous previous admissions.\nCharlie was born at 32 weeks gestation after a pregnancy complicated by recurrent bleeding. He needed headbox oxygen for 5 days. By discharge home at 6 weeks, he was bottle-fed  删除换行1 and his weight was on the 25th centile. Over the next 2 months he had several admissions  删除换行1 with possible apnoeas, but investigations including an EEG and brain MRI were normal and  删除换行1 none were witnessed during observation on the ward. At 4 months he had two episodes of  删除换行1 haematemesis confirmed on inspection of the towels his mother brought with her and had a  删除换行1 normal full blood count, clotting screen and barium meal. His weight by then had dropped  删除换行1 to the 2nd centile and it has not been above it since, and has occasionally fallen to below the  删除换行1 0.4th centile.\n\n【3】He has persistent, frequent, loose stools often containing visible blood. A diagnosis of cow’s  删除换行1 milk protein intolerance was made, but a dairy-free diet made no difference. He is now on a  删除换行1 hydrolysated (pre-digested) formula. Solids were introduced at 5 months.\n\n【4】During his admissions the nurses have fed him and report that he is always hungry and  删除换行1 takes good amounts, but there has been no significant weight gain. Charlie has had extensive  删除换行1 normal investigations, including an abdominal ultrasound, small bowel biopsy and a colonoscopy, when no blood was seen. There are no concerns about his development. His 4-yearold brother was also investigated for poor weight gain. With the permission of the parents,  删除换行1 reports have been obtained from the tertiary centre to which the 4-year-old was referred – he,  删除换行1 too, had exhaustive tests, but no diagnosis was ever made. His growth chart shows a rapid  删除换行1 improvement in weight gain from about 2 years. Charlie’s mother is a pharmacy technician  删除换行1 and his father is a lorry driver. The staff know them well and his mother is always happy  删除换行1 to stay.\n\n【5】Examination\n\n【6】Charlie looks skinny. He has redundant skin folds over his thighs and buttocks. His weight is  删除换行1 just below the 0.4th centile, and his length and head circumference are on the 50th centiles.\nHe is not clubbed and not clinically anaemic. His pulse is 180 beats/min. Examination is  删除换行1 otherwise unremarkable.\n\n【7】Questions\n\n【8】• What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【9】• What could be the mechanisms contributing to Charlie’s history and current clinical  删除换行1 state?\n\n【10】• What should happen next?\n\n【11】ANSWER 100\n\n【12】Charlie has had several unexplained episodes of potentially serious illness and now has  删除换行1 evidence of ongoing faltering weight gain with blood in his stools but not at colonoscopy.\nExhaustive investigations are normal. This is on the background of being born preterm  删除换行1 after a complicated pregnancy and having an older brother who had a similar pattern of  删除换行1 illness in the first 2 years of life. This is all highly consistent with a diagnosis of fabricated  删除换行1 or induced illness (FII), an uncommon and difficult to diagnose form of child abuse. The  删除换行1 perpetrator may:\n\n【13】• Fabricate a medical history.\n\n【14】• Cause symptoms by repeatedly exposing the child to a toxin, medication, infectious  删除换行1 agent or physical trauma, including smothering.\n\n【15】• Alter laboratory samples or temperature measurements.\n\n【16】The mother is almost always responsible (as the primary caregiver) and a significant percentage have connections with the health services. Sadly the disturbed parent seems to obtain  删除换行1 a perverse satisfaction from the close association with hospital care and staff. The possible  删除换行1 mechanisms in this case include the blood in the vomit and stools being his mother’s, possibly  删除换行1 even her menstrual blood. Specimens can be analysed for ‘foreign’ blood. The vaginal bleeding  删除换行1 during pregnancy may have been self-induced. The apnoeas could have many explanations  删除换行1 and covert surveillance by the police may be needed if episodes are ongoing and smothering  删除换行1 is a possibility. Faltering weight gain means that energy expenditure exceeds energy intake.\nPossibilities include diluting his feeds, throwing feeds away or poisoning with laxatives or  删除换行1 an agent that increases metabolic rate such as thyroxine – to which Charlie’s mother, as a  删除换行1 pharmacy technician, would have access. This possibility is supported by his tachycardia.\nThyrotoxicosis is extraordinarily rare in this age group and thyroid function tests may be  删除换行1 normal if doses are not given every day. Some mothers become highly sophisticated at FII – \n\n【17】and  Charlie’s mother may have had prior experience with her older boy. A phone call to  删除换行1 the GP may reveal a history of abuse during the mother’s childhood or prior mental health  删除换行1 problems, but these do not mean that this is FII. It is all supportive, not diagnostic, evidence.\n\n【18】However, it is crucial to make the diagnosis because this disorder can be very damaging to  删除换行1 the child, not just from the impact of the unnecessary and invasive investigations but because  删除换行1 of long-term behavioural and other problems. Other children in the household may also be  删除换行1 at risk. The case must be referred to Social Care, who have a statutory duty to undertake a  删除换行1 thorough investigation according to strict guidelines. The child protection register should be  删除换行1 checked and the health visitor should be contacted for further information. At the same time,  删除换行1 it is worth obtaining a second opinion from another consultant paediatrician.\n\n【19】Key Points\n\n【20】• Fabricated and induced illness should be considered in any child with recurrent  删除换行1 unexplained symptoms, but it may be difficult to diagnose.\n\n【21】• All potential cases of fabricated and induced illness must be referred to Social Care.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

While folate supplementation (answer B) is needed for hematopoiesis， it has no effect on the number of sickle cell crises.\n\n【17】58.2 C. In patients with suspected ACS and/or pneumonia， the third-generation cephalosporin cefotaxime， together with a macrolide such as azithromy-cin， is optimal to provide coverage for the most common pathogens， such as S. pneumoniae and Moraxella， respectively. Azithromycin or erythromycin provides coverage for atypical organisms， such as Mycoplasma and Chlamydia. Although a cephalosporin such as ceftriaxone (answer B) is appropriate to cover for common gram-positive and gram-negative etiologies of pneumonia， this patient with likely autosplenectomy requires broader coverage. In very ill patients or if a large and/or increasing infiltrate concerning for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is suspected， vancomycin (answer A) can be added， but it is not routinely used as an initial stand-alone agent. Answer D (penicillin) is insufficient coverage for pneumonia due to high resistance.\n\n【18】58.3 D. In sickle cell patients， aplastic crisis can result from a temporary stop in red blood cell production， characterized by a very low hemoglobin and reticu-locyte count less than 1%. In contrast， aplastic anemia (answer C) is defined as pancytopenia in patients without sickle cell disease. Splenic sequestration(answer B) is associated with abdominal pain， increased reticulocytes， and an acute drop in hemoglobin due to vaso-occlusion and pooling of red blood cells in the spleen. In ACS (answer A)， chest pain and respiratory symptoms are commonly seen.\n\n【19】58.4 C. In children with sickle cell anemia， aplastic crisis is most commonly associ-ated with parvovirus B19. Staphylococcus aureus (answer D) and Salmonella(answer B) are the most common causes of osteomyelitis in sickle cell patients. It is important to remember the association between sickle cell anemia and Salmonella osteomyelitis.

She states that her hands feel stiff and clumsy and that she has difficulty buttoning her clothes or using her keys. She has fallen several times in the past couple of weeks when walking up and down stairs at home. Lately， both she and her husband have noticed that she will“stumble over words” when she talks. She denies having any funny sensations or numbness and has no family his-tory of neurological disease.\n\n【2】On physical examination， she is alert， appropriate， and oriented to person， place， and time. Her cranial nerves are intact except for some subtle fascicula-tions (involuntary muscle twitches) of her tongue. Strength testing of her right arm and leg shows mild weakness with pronator drift. Muscle stretch reflexes are brisk in upper extremities but reduced in her right leg. She also has difficulty with rapid alternating movements of her right arm. There are no abnormal findings on sensory examination. The physician has a presumptive diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and explains that this is an upper motor neuron disease.\n\n【3】What part of the nervous system is likely to be involved?\n\n【4】Explain the mechanism of the fasciculations in this disease.\n\n【5】What are the pathological findings for this disease?\n\n【6】ANSWERS TO CASE 2：\n\n【7】The Neuron\n\n【8】Summary： A 54-year-old woman with progressive weakness of her arms and legs with subtle speech difficulties is diagnosed with ALS.\n\n【9】●Part of nervous system affected： The central nervous system (CNS)， specifi-cally the motor neurons.\n\n【10】Fasciculations： ALS is a progressive， neurodegenerative disease affecting motor neurons， which are cells within the CNS that control voluntary muscle movement. The loss of signal communication to the muscles caused by the degeneration of these cells leads to muscle atrophy， which manifests itself in fasciculations.\n\n【11】·Pathology： Loss of motor neurons in the brainstem nuclei and the anterior horns of the spinal cord， along with degeneration of the corticospinal tracts in the spinal cord.\n\n【12】CLINICAL CORRELATION\n\n【13】ALS is a progressive degenerative disorder of the motor neurons of the spinal cord， brainstem nuclei， and corticospinal tracts. In its classical presentation， patients in their sixth decade initially complain of difficulty with fine finger movements and stiffness and weakness of the fingers and hands. The patients can also experience cramps or fasciculations of the muscles in the upper extremities. As time progresses， atrophic weakness involves both upper extremities， and spasticity and hyperreflexia develops in the lower extremities. The muscles of the neck， tongue， pharynx， and larynx may also become involved. Depending on the extent of involvement of the various motor neurons， a mixed upper and lower motor neuron disease becomes evident. There are no cognitive， sensory， or autonomic disturbances in this disease. An electromyelogram (EMG) obtained for confirmatory purposes reveals wide-spread fibrillations and fasciculations， evidence of active denervation and reinner vation of the muscles. Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may reveal normal or slightly elevated protein levels. Unfortunately， the etiology of ALS is unknown. As the disease reaches its ultimate conclusion， the patient is left with flaccid paralysis of all voluntary muscles with the exception of the extraocular and sphincter muscles. Treatment is directed toward minimizing the disability. For instance， medications such as baclofen and diazepam can be used to treat spasticity. The median survival from onset of symptoms is 3-4 years， although individuals can live a normal life span if proper care is available.\n\n【14】OBJECTIVES\n\n【15】1\\. Describe the role and structure of a neuron.\n\n【16】2\\. Know the classification of neurons based upon morphology.\n\n【17】3\\. Know the classification of neurons based upon function.\n\n【18】CYTOSKELETON： The internal network of fibers that form the framework inside a cell. In the neuron， the cytoskeleton consists of three types of filaments-—microtubules， neurofilaments， and microfilaments-and determines the shape of the neuron， provides cell rigidity， and creates a mechanism for intracellular transport.\n\n【19】SOMA： The cell body of the neuron， which contains the organelles and acts as the metabolic center of the cell.\n\n【20】DENDRITES： Armlike extensions protruding from the cell membrane that increase the surface area of the neuron and receive signals from other neurons.\n\n【21】AXON： The main conducting unit for carrying electrical signals， known as action potentials， to other cells. Action potentials are formed at the axon hillock， the ori-gin of the axon at the cell body， and are propagated down the axon in a rapid all-or-none transmission to the next cell.\n\n【22】PRESYNAPTIC TERMINAL： The end of an axon that forms a synapse or neu-rochemical cleft with the next cell (neural， muscular， etc). Signals are transmitted across the synapse via the release of neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft that diffuse into the postsynaptic cell， chemically triggering a physiological response.\n\n【23】Morphological Features\n\n【24】Neurons， the basic functional components of the brain， are cells that act as the main signaling units of the nervous system. The cytoskeleton of the neuron is composed of three types of filaments， each constructed from different classes of proteins. Together they form the cytoskeletal structure of the neurons that determine the shape of the neuron， provide stiffness to the cell， and create a mechanism for intracellular transport.\n\n【25】Microtubules (about 25 nm in diameter)， the largest of the filaments， are con-structed from 13 different types of protofilaments in a circular array and serve to maintain the neuron’s processes. The protofilaments are formed by two subunits， alpha and beta tubulin， in an alternating pattern. Microtubules are also involved in axoplasmic transport， or movement of various cell components along an axon such as mitochondria，lipids， synaptic vesicles， proteins， and so on.\n\n【26】Neurofilaments or intermediate filaments are approximately 10 nm in diameter and are more abundant than either microtubules or microfilaments. Neurofila-ments are made from strands of proteins that pair into a helical structure. The pairs of proteins then twist together to form larger protofilaments. Four proto-filaments combine to form the final neurofilament. Neurofilaments can form cross-links with microtubules to provide stiffness and shape to the cell. Within the context of Alzheimer disease， neurofilaments are modified to form patho-logical protein aggregates called neurofibrillary tangles.\n\n【27】Microfilaments are， as the name implies， the thinnest of the fiber types at approximately 3-5 nm in diameter and are formed by the polymerization of the protein actin to form a double helical structure. Microfilaments are located at the periphery of the cell adjacent to the cytoplasm of the cell. Together with multiple types of actin-binding proteins， they assist in the dynamic functions of the cell.\n\n【28】There are four distinct morphological features in a typical neuron.\n\n【29】The cell body or soma acts as the metabolic center of the neuron and contains the ultrastructural organelles， such as the nucleus (DNA storage and ribosome production)， endoplasmic reticulum (protein synthesis)， mitochondria (energy through ATP production)， lysosomes (waste disposal)， and vesicles (packaging and transport) necessary to carry out basic metabolic functions.\n\n【30】Multiple short dendrites branch out from the cell body in a treelike fashion. Dendrites function mainly to increase the surface area of the neurons and to receive signals from other neurons.\n\n【31】A single axon arises from the cell body and serves as the main conducting unit for carrying electrical signals to other neurons and muscles. These electrical signals， called action potentials， are rapid all-or-none transmissions down the length of the axon. Action potentials are formed at the axon hillock， the ori-gin of the axon from the cell body. To facilitate transmission of the electrical signal， axons may be wrapped in myelin sheaths produced by oligodendrocytes or Schwann cells.\n\n【32】The presynaptic terminal at the end of the axon forms a synapse with the post-synaptic cell， that is， other neurons or muscle cells. When the action potential reaches the presynaptic terminal， a cascade of events occurs culminating in the release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. The neurotransmitters dif-fuse to the postsynaptic cell， where they trigger certain physiological responses.\n\n【33】Santiago Ramon y Cajal， using silver staining techniques developed by Camillo Golgi， was first to notice that the shape of the neuron could be used for classification. Based upon the number of axons and dendrites which originate from the cell body， neurons can be classified into several broad groups.\n\n【34】●Unipolar neurons are the simplest nerve cells and have a single process emerg-ing from the cell body. This process branches with one branch functioning as the axon and the other branches functioning as dendrites. They are found throughout the central nervous system of invertebrates and in the autonomic nervous system of vertebrates.\n\n【35】Bipolar neurons have two processes attached to an oval-shaped cell body. One process functions as a dendrite and carries information from the periphery of the organism. The other process functions as the axon carrying information toward the central nervous system. Bipolar neurons are found in the retina of the eye and the olfactory epithelium of the nose.\n\n【36】Pseudo-unipolar neurons are a variant of the bipolar neuron and have a single process which emerges from the cell body. This single process splits into two； one functions as a dendrite carrying information from the periphery to the cell body， and the other functions as the axon transmitting the information to the central nervous system. They are found in the dorsal root ganglia of the spinal cord and relay touch， pressure， and pain sensations from the extremities to the spinal cord.\n\n【37】Multipolar neurons are the main neuron type in the mammalian central ner-vous system. These neurons have a single axon and multiple dendrites emerg-ing from the cell body. The processes of multipolar neurons vary in number， diameter， and length， depending on the number of synaptic contacts they make with other neurons.\n\n【38】Functional Classification\n\n【39】Neurons can also be classified according to the function that they serve within the nervous system.\n\n【40】Sensory or afferent neurons carry information from the body to the central nervous system. Sensory information can include pain， pressure， touch， and joint position sense， among others.\n\n【41】Motor neurons carry commands from the brain and spinal cord to muscles and glands in the periphery.\n\n【42】Interneurons comprise all neurons which do not fit into the previous two groups. Interneurons carry information within the nervous system and connect with neighboring or distant neurons.\n\n【43】All behaviors are mediated by a series of neurons that form signaling networks. For instance， mechanoreceptors carry information concerning joint position through sensory neurons to the spinal cord. This information is transmitted through various interneurons in the spinal cord and brain to allow the central nervous system to pro-cess and determine where an individual's limb is in relation to the body and space. Once a decision is made to move the extremity， a variety of interneurons transmits the information to motor neurons that relay the final command to the muscles. In this role， interneurons， through a variety of neurotransmitters， can act to either excite or inhibit other neurons.\n\n【44】Spinal Cord Neurons\n\n【45】Neurons within the spinal cord are organized into somatosensory and motor neu-rons. Somatosensory neurons form an ascending tract of neurons running up the spinal cord transmitting information about touch， proprioception (balance and 删除换行1 self-awareness)， vibration， pain， and temperature. Motor neurons form a descending tract of neurons running down the spinal cord to control muscle function through-out the body. The cord itself is divided into several sections axially： the dorsal， lat-eral， and ventral horns. Somatosensory neurons from the body run into the dorsal horn， where they connect with interneurons in the lateral horn that transmit infor-mation via the ascending tracts to the brain， or in the case of a spinal reflex， directly to motor neurons in the ventral horn. Motor neurons running out of the ventral horn are similarly controlled by direct reflex signaling from a sensory neuron or by efferent (motor) neurons traveling down the descending tract from the brain.\n删除13：<u>CASE CORRELATES\n删除25：<u>See Cases 1-10 (cellular and molecular neuroscience cases).</u>\n</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The susceptibility to infection is correlated with the severity of hypercortisolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 39 \\]</u>. Glucocorticoids are potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents. Excessive glucocorticoids have been shown to suppress cellular and humoral immune function , thereby increasing the risk of opportunistic infections, particularly invasive fungal infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 39 , 40 \\]</u>. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) has been reported in patients with CS, particularly in patients with ectopic ACTH production and severe hypercortisolism. The risk of infection is potentiated by hyperglycemia, atrophy of the skin disrupting the protective barrier against pathogens, and poor wound healing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 39 , 41 \\]</u>. The diagnosis of infection in the setting of cortisol excess can be challenging due to the masking of the typical infectious signs and symptoms, for example, leukocytosis and fever, due to the anti-inflammatory properties of glucocorticoids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 39 \\]</u>. Age-appropriate vaccinations should be offered to all patients with CD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. Due to lack of large studies, PJP prophylaxis is not formally recommended but should be considered in patients with severe hypercortisolemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 41 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】### Musculoskeletal\n\n【4】Osteoporosis is found in 38–50% of CD patients, and skeletal fractures, mainly vertebral, have been reported in up to 70% of patients with endogenous hypercortisolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 11 \\]</u>. Excess cortisol inhibits bone formation, increases bone resorption, decreases calcium absorption from the gut, and influences the secretion of hormones (e.g. gonadotropins), cytokines, and growth factors related to bone metabolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 42 \\]</u>. The catabolic effects of hypercortisolemia on muscles, which leads to muscle weakness and disuse, may also play a role by decreasing the muscle trophic effect on the bone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Evaluation of bone mineral density with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) , assessment of vitamin D levels, and maintenance of adequate calcium and vitamin D intake are recommended 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 , 43 \\]</u>. Bone damage is potentially reversible with control of hypercortisolism; however the time to complete bone recovery is relatively long (3–5 years) and variable 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 43 \\]</u>. Patients at high fracture risk, e.g. older patients, patients with low ( t score −1.0 to −2.5) or very low ( t score < −2.5) bone mineral density via DEXA, history of fragility fracture, or low chance for cure in the near future, should be considered for bisphosphonate therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 43 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】Myopathy, mainly affecting the proximal muscles, is frequently described in CS, with a prevalence of 42–83% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Glucocorticoids induce type 2 muscle fiber atrophy, impair protein synthesis in muscles, stimulate proteolysis, and impair sarcolemma excitability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 44 \\]</u>. Proximal muscle weakness is generally thought to improve with remission; however functional muscle impairment has been described during long-term follow-up despite remission 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 45 \\]</u>. Patients may need physical therapy after surgical cure for CD.\n\n【6】### Dermatologic\n\n【7】Dermatologic manifestations occur in about 60–90% of patients with CS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Abnormalities include purple striae, facial plethora, bruising, delayed wound healing, hyperpigmentation, acanthosis nigricans, acne, hirsutism, and alopecia. Impaired keratinocyte and dermal fibroblast proliferation, in addition to impaired synthesis and turnover of collagen and mucopolysaccharides, leads to skin atrophy and vascular fragility. Hirsutism, acne, and alopecia are attributed to adrenal androgens. Hyperpigmentation can be seen in CD due to binding of ACTH to melanocortin receptors on melanocytes. Dermatologic manifestations improve after surgical or pharmacologic remission with the exception of striae which often lighten in color but do not disappear 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【8】### Neuropsychiatric\n\n【9】Psychopathology is exceedingly prevalent in CD, with 54–85% of patients diagnosed with some psychiatric disturbance . The most common psychopathology associated with endogenous hypercortisolism is major depression with a prevalence of 55–80% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Other psychopathological manifestations include anxiety, mania, acute psychosis, emotional lability, and paranoia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 46 \\]</u>. Irritability is commonly reported and has an early onset, often before other signs and symptoms of CD are apparent. Neurocognitive disorders, typically manifested by impairment of concentration and memory, have been reported in over 60% of CS patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 47 \\]</u>. The pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric dysfunction related to hypercortisolism is not fully understood but is thought to be related to chronic brain exposure to cortisol excess causing deep structural and functional changes to the hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex, areas of the brain rich in glucocorticoid receptors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 4 \\]</u>. Apparent cerebral atrophy, notably hippocampal atrophy, is present in CS and is at least partially reversible following correction of hypercortisolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 48 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】The mainstay of treatment is normalization of cortisol with surgery or medications. Antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors , and psychotherapeutic strategies such as cognitive behavioral therapy can be utilized while awaiting definitive treatment of hypercortisolism , although antidepressants are typically less effective in the setting of marked hypercortisolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 46 \\]</u>. Neuropsychiatric disorders generally improve after disease remission; however several studies reported that these disorders can persist long term after resolution of hypercortisolism and in a subset of patients may worsen, possibly related to relative glucocorticoid deficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 47 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】### Reproductive\n\n【12】Reproductive and sexual disorders are frequently reported in CS. The most common clinical features are decreased libido (24–90%), hypogonadism in men (50–75%), and menstrual irregularity (43–80%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. It is suggested that hypercortisolism inhibits the action of gonadotropins on the gonads and gonadotropin-releasing hormone secretion from the hypothalamus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 49 \\]</u>. In CD, compression of the normal pituitary gland from an adenoma may lead to reduced gonadotropin synthesis and release. There is some data to suggest that hypogonadism in males resolves after remission; however resolution of hypogonadism and menstrual irregularities is variable and requires evaluation after remission . Hormone replacement is not usually recommended during active disease due to high thromboembolic risk; however if gonadal function has not been restored after 3 months or more of remission, replacement can be considered 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 46 , 50 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【14】CD is associated with significant clinical burden, with increased mortality and impaired quality of life.

Which of the following statements is most appropriate?\n\n【1】A. Bupropion is pregnancy category C and relatively safe in pregnancy.\n\n【2】B. Varenicline is pregnancy category B and relatively safe in pregnancy.\n\n【3】C. Nicotine gum delivers a lower and safer dose of nicotine than the nasal spray.\n\n【4】D. The use of smoking cessation products during pregnancy frequently leads to adverse outcomes.\n\n【5】Answer: 7.1 A . Bupropion and varenicline are both pregnancy category C. Pregnant smokers should be encouraged to quit without the use of any pharmacologic agents. However, pharmacologic aids to increase the rate of smoking cessation during pregnancy can be used, after discussion with the patient of the risks and benefits of the medications and of continued smoking. Cessation of smoking at any time during the pregnancy is likely to provide health benefits for the mother and fetus. Nicotine gum delivers higher doses of nicotine than its nasal spray counterpart.\n\n【6】Question: 7.2 Which of the following statements regarding available treatments for smoking cessation is accurate?\n\n【7】A. Bupropion can be used in combination with nicotine supplements.\n\n【8】B. Nicotine gum is most effective if chewed continuously, to promote a constant release of the nicotine.\n\n【9】C. Nicotine supplements are most effective when used as needed for withdrawal symptoms.\n\n【10】D. All of the available agents are more effective when used in combinations with each other.\n\n【11】Answer: 7.2 A . Bupropion can be used in combination with any of the nicotine supplementation products. The nicotine products can also be used in combination with each other. Varenicline has not been studied for use with other smoking cessation agents. Two common pitfalls in using nicotine supplementation are using supplementation only when having withdrawal symptoms and failing to use nicotine gum correctly. The gum should be chewed briefly and then parked in the cheek. It is less effective if chewed continuously.\n\n【12】Question: 7.3 Which of the following counseling strategies is most likely to enhance your patients’ smoking cessation rates?\n\n【13】A. Discuss smoking cessation techniques only with patients who ask for your advice, as others will resent your suggestions.\n\n【14】B. Emphasize primarily the health risks of smoking.\n\n【15】C. Note in each patient’s chart that you have discussed cessation, so that you don’t repeat the message to the same patient at subsequent visits.\n\n【16】D. Ask about smoking cessation at each encounter.\nAnswer: 7.3 D . Asking patients about tobacco use is a key to promoting cessation. It is important to ask each patient at each visit and to be prepared to provide advice and assistance at any time.\n\n【17】CLINICAL PEARLS\n\n【18】 Most smokers require multiple attempts before successfully quitting for good.

Stone In The Submandibular Duct.—\n\n【4】If the stone is palpable near the orifice of the duct 删除换行1 it can be removed by an incision made directly over it  删除换行1 through the mucous membrane of the mouth. The stone  删除换行1 is steadied between the thumb and index finger, the  删除换行1 overlying tissues will be infiltrated with local anaesthesia.\nAn incision is made directly upon the stone, which is  删除换行1 extracted with a small scoop. A stay suture may be passed  删除换行1 under the duct to bring it up into the top of the wound,  删除换行1 as also not to allow to slip the stone posteriorly into the  删除换行1 gland and then an incision is made on the wall of the  删除换行1 duct to remove the stone.\n\n【5】B. Stone In The Submandibular Gland.— Excision  删除换行1 of the salivary gland is advised.\n\n【6】SUBMANDIBULAR CALCULI\n\n【7】HISTORY.—\nSUBMANDIBULAR SALIVARY GLAND ARE :\n\n【8】(i) When the gland is chronically inflamed.\n\n【9】(ii) When the gland is the site of stone formation.\n\n【10】(iii) Any tumour of the gland.\n\n【11】(iv) Secondary carcinoma of the submandibular  删除换行1 lymph nodes.\n\n【12】OPERATION.— A curved incision is made over the  删除换行1 lower third of the gland about 5 cm long in the line of  删除换行1 skin creases (Langer's line). The skin and platysma are  删除换行1 divided in the same line to avoid injury to the cervical  删除换行1 branch of the facial nerve. The posterior end of the  删除换行1 incision should lie at least 2 cm distant from the angle  删除换行1 of the mandible. The anterior facial vein is found within  删除换行1 the fat superficial to the gland. This vein is divided  删除换行1 between ligatures. The lower pole of the gland is freed  删除换行1 keeping close to the surface of the gland and is' turned  删除换行1 upwards and forwards. The posterior belly of the digastric  删除换行1 and the stylohyoid muscles are identified. These are  删除换行1 retracted backwards with a retractor. The facial artery  删除换行1 with its venae comitantes will be seen emerging from  删除换行1 deep to the muscles and entering to the deep surface of  删除换行1 the gland. It is divided between ligatures very carefully  删除换行1 with double ligation of the proximal ends, as the artery  删除换行1 tends to retract beneath the muscles. The gland is now  删除换行1 drawn down and is separated from the lower border of  删除换行1 the jaw dissecting close to the gland. If the lower pole  删除换行1 of the gland is now retracted backwards the posterior  删除换行1 border of the mylohyoid muscle will be seen. It is  删除换行1 separated with scissors from the groove between the  删除换行1 superficial and deep parts of the glands. Small arteries  删除换行1 entering the gland from the muscle should be divided  删除换行1 between ligatures or sealed with diathermy. The deep part  删除换行1 of the gland is now drawn down with care not to injure  删除换行1 the lingual nerve. The nerve is separated under direct  删除换行1 vision. The submandibular duct is now drawn down  删除换行1 through the loop of the lingual nerve. The duct should  删除换行1 be clamped and divided between ligatures as forward as 删除换行1 possible. So that major portion of the duct remains with  删除换行1 the gland. All throughout the process the dissection should  删除换行1 be kept close to the gland so that the hypoglossal nerve  删除换行1 is not injured. Sometimes veins from the gland may drain  删除换行1 into the venae comitantes of the hypoglossal nerve. These  删除换行1 should be divided between ligatures with great care. The  删除换行1 submandibular salivary gland with its duct is now taken  删除换行1 out of the wound. The wound is closed in layers as  删除换行1 usual with vacuum drainage.\n\n【13】SYMPTOMS.—\nAbout 15% of the salivary tumours occur in the  删除换行1 submandibular salivary glands. Of these 60% are benign,  删除换行1 in contrast to the parotid glands where 80% tumours  删除换行1 are benign. Of the benign tumours in the submandibular  删除换行1 salivary gland 90% are pleomorphic adenomas. The  删除换行1 malignant tumours of the salivary gland are also slow  删除换行1 growing. Students must remember that benign tumours  删除换行1 of submandibular gland may be painful and these are to  删除换行1 be differentiated from submandibular lymphadenopathy.\n\n【14】Submandibular gland tumours :—\n\n【15】• These constitute 15% of all salivary tumours.\n\n【16】• About 60% are benign and 90% of these are  删除换行1 pleomorphic adenomas.\n\n【17】• Malignant tumours are slow growing.\n\n【18】• Benign tumours may be painful.\n\n【19】EXAMINATIONS.—\nClinical features.—\n\n【20】The swelling is hard on palpation. The history is 删除换行1 relatively small. But submandibular carcinoma is a  删除换行1 relatively slow growing tumour.\n\n【21】On palpation the glands feel irregular and hard. It  删除换行1 may be fixed to the deeper structures so there is no  删除换行1 mobility. Cervical lymph nodes will be enlarged and  删除换行1 relatively hard.\n\n【22】Investigations.—\n\n【23】• Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAC) is a safe  删除换行1 procedure. If the needle gauge does not exceed 18 G,  删除换行1 there is no risk of seeding tumour cells.\n\n【24】• Open surgical biopsy is never performed in salivary  删除换行1 tumours as it seeds the tumour cells into surrounding  删除换行1 tissues.\n\n【25】• CT scan and MRI are in fact the most important  删除换行1 imaging techniques in major salivary gland tumours. The  删除换行1 outline of the tumour can be assessed to know whether  删除换行1 it is circumscribed or benign or diffuse. These  删除换行1 investigations can also indicate the relation of the tumour  删除换行1 with other anatomical structures which may help in  删除换行1 planning surgery.\n\n【26】Treatment.—\n\n【27】Treatment is excision of the tumour with a cuff of  删除换行1 normal tissue. When the tumour is small and totally  删除换行1 encapsulated within the submandibular gland, the whole  删除换行1 tumour can be excised alongwith the capsule.\n\n【28】In case of benign tumours, that are large and extend  删除换行1 beyond submandibular gland, a suprahyoid neck dissection  删除换行1 should be performed excising the whole of the  删除换行1 submandibular gland alongwith the tumour, but  删除换行1 mandibular branch of the facial nerve, lingual nerve and  删除换行1 hypoglossal nerve should be preserved. This in fact clears  删除换行1 the submandibular triangle alongwith the dissection of  删除换行1 the periosteum along the lower border and inner aspect  删除换行1 of the mandible.

Arising from the mucoperiosteum i.e. Epulis. There  删除换行1 are five varieties of Epulis —\n\n【42】(i) Fibrous.\n\n【43】(ii) Granulomatous.\n\n【44】(iii) Myeloid.\n\n【45】(iv) Sarcomatous.\n\n【46】(v) Carcinomatous.\n\n【47】B. Arising from tooth germ i.e. odontomes. The  删除换行1 different varieties are —\n\n【48】1. Cysts of the jaw.—\n\n【49】(a) Odontogenic developmental cyst or follicular 删除换行1 cyst —\n\n【50】(i) Dental cyst;\n\n【51】(ii) Dentigerous cyst; 删除换行1 (iii) Keratocyst;\n\n【52】(b) Fissural cyst.\n\n【53】2. Odontogenic tumours.—\n\n【54】(a) Odontomas;\n\n【55】(b) Ameloblastoma.\n\n【56】C. Osseous tumour.— Any bone tumour can affect  删除换行1 the jaw. But there are a few bone tumours which occur  删除换行1 more often in the jaws. These are discussed later in this  删除换行1 chapter.\n\n【57】D. Inflammatory group.—\n\n【58】(i) Alveolar abscess.\n\n【59】(ii) Osteomyelitis.\n\n【60】(iii) Actinomycosis.\n\n【61】OTHER INDICATIONS FOR EXCISION OF THE\n\n【62】The word ‘Epulis’ is an old term which means ‘upon  删除换行1 the gum’. So ‘epulis’ is a swelling situated on the gum. It  删除换行1 arises from the alveolar margin of the jaw. It can originate  删除换行1 from the bone, the periosteum or the mucous membrane.\nEnlargement of gum or gingival enlargement may be  删除换行1 either generalised or localised. Localised enlargement is  删除换行1 mainly known as epulis. The different varieties are  删除换行1 described below.\n\n【63】TUMOURS OF THE SUBMANDIBULAR\n\n【64】GLANDS\n\n【65】It is the most common of all the varieties of epulis. It  删除换行1 arises from the periosteum at the neck of an incisor or 删除换行1 premolar tooth. It is in fact a localised inflammatory  删除换行1 hyperplasia of the gum. It arises in response to local  删除换行1 irritation from the sharp margin of a carious cavity. As it  删除换行1 grows, it separates the teeth and ultimately loosens them.\n\n【66】PATHOLOGY.— It is fibroma and is composed of  删除换行1 fusiform cells with many new blood vessels.\n\n【67】CLINICAL FEATURES.— (i) In the beginning it is  删除换行1 soft and red, gradually it becomes a firm nodule with  删除换行1 pink colour due to deposition of more collagen within it.\nIt is a firm nodule at the junction of the gum and tooth  删除换行1 删除33：<u></u>.\n\n【68】(ii) It becomes pedunculated, though the pedicle  删除换行1 remains quite short, so much so that it may look sessile.\n\n【69】(iii) It is a slow growing tumour. It usually ceases  删除换行1 to grow after attaining about 1 cm in diameter. A few  删除换行1 however become larger and may ulcerate due to trauma  删除换行1 during mastication, which may resemble a malignant  删除换行1 neoplasm.\n\n【70】(iv) It is often seen in relation to the incisor or premolar tooth.\n\n【71】(v) It is not tender.\n\n【72】(vi) The adjacent teeth may be slightly separated  删除换行1 and be loose.\n\n【73】(vii) Draining lymph nodes are not enlarged.\n\n【74】CARCINOMA OF THE SUBMANDIBULAR\n\n【75】SALIVARY GLANDS\n\n【76】(i) It may undergo malignant change — fibrosarcoma.\nThen it looks soft bluish red. It grows rapidly and often  删除换行1 bleeds.\n\n【77】(ii) It may recur after operation if its root is not  删除换行1 thoroughly excised.\n\n【78】CLASSIFICATION OF JAW SWELLINGS\n\n【79】Excision is the treatment of choice. Adjacent tooth or  删除换行1 teeth and resection of a wedge of bone with its root must  删除换行1 be performed, as it is considered to be the source of  删除换行1 irritation to form this condition. This is to prevent  删除换行1 recurrence.\n\n【80】EPULIS\n\n【81】It is often called false epulis or pregnancy epulis or  删除换行1 pyogenic granuloma. It is a mass of granulation tissue  删除换行1 around a carious tooth or at the site of irritation by a  删除换行1 denture.\n\n【82】A similar condition may be found temporarily during  删除换行1 pregnancy which is known as gingivitis gravidarum. This  删除换行1 condition occurs due to hormonal changes in pregnancy.\n\n【83】The unusual response is due to relatively insignificant  删除换行1 deposits of calculus on the gum which acts as irritant.\nThe gum margins becomes red and swollen and bleed  删除换行1 easily. This particularly occurs during the last month of  删除换行1 pregnancy. Such pregnancy epulis tends to regress after  删除换行1 child birth.\n\n【84】FIBROUS EPULIS.—\n\n【85】(i) The swelling looks bright red.\n\n【86】(ii) It is soft, pink and vascular.\n\n【87】(iii) It easily bleeds on touch, as it is a mass of granulation tissue.\n\n【88】(iv) It is often associated with a carious tooth, so it  删除换行1 is found in those who do not maintain oral hygiene.\nOffensive smell of mouth is often associated with. This  删除换行1 may be due to infection of the epulis.\n\n【89】(v) Sometimes ill-fitting denture may cause such  删除换行1 swelling.\n\n【90】(vi) The draining lymph nodes may be enlarged and  删除换行1 tender.\n\n【91】COMPLICATIONS.—\n\n【92】(i) Extraction of the carious tooth associated with  删除换行1 the swelling.\n\n【93】(ii) If ill-fitting denture is the cause, it should be  删除换行1 replaced.\n\n【94】(iii) Maintenance of (Tral hygiene.\n\n【95】(iv) The granulation tissue is scraped away and is  删除换行1 examined histologically.\n\n【96】(v) The mass of granulation tissue may be  删除换行1 diathermised.\n\n【97】MYELOID EPULIS (Syn. Giant-cell epulis).—\n\n【98】Myeloid epulis is purple and pedunculated tumour.\nIt is less common than fibrous epulis and granulomatous  删除换行1 epulis. It also arises due to irritation from an adjacent  删除换行1 infected socket or at the site of a shed primary tooth.\n\n【99】It is an osteoclastoma and arises from the underlying  删除换行1 bone.\n\n【100】TREATMRNT.—\n\n【101】Microscopically the stroma consists of fibrocellular  删除换行1 tissue. Multinucleated giant cells, as found in typical  删除换行1 osteoclastoma, are found scattered.\n\n【102】GRANULOMATOUS EPULIS.—\n\n【103】(i) Although the underlying mass is firm due to  删除换行1 expansion of the marginal bone under cover of the  删除换行1 mucoperiosteum, yet the gum covering it becomes  删除换行1 hyperaemic, oedematous and soft to touch.\n\n【104】(ii) It is plum-coloured due to high vascularity.\n\n【105】(iii) It is always sessile.\n\n【106】(iv) It is more rapidly growing tumour than the other  删除换行1 varieties of epulis.\n\n【107】(v) The adjoining teeth are separated and loosened.\n\n【108】(vi) X-ray may be performed to show typical soapbubble appearance of osteoclastoma.\n\n【109】CLINICAL FEATURES.—\n\n【110】(i) Ulceration.\n\n【111】(ii) Serious haemorrhage.\n\n【112】TREATMENT.—\n\n【113】(i) In case of small swelling, the treatment is  删除换行1 curettage and filling the cavity with cancellous bone chips.\n\n【114】(ii) In case of large tumours, radical excision of the  删除换行1 bone should be performed requiring graft in case of  删除换行1 mandible. The graft is often taken from a rib.\n\n【115】PATHOLOGY.—\n\n【116】It is an epithelioma of the gum. It usually arises from  删除换行1 the mucous membrane of the alveolar margin. But it may  删除换行1 arise around a tooth or in a socket. It is an infiltrating  删除换行1 lesion, which becomes infected and painful. In late stage  删除换行1 the lesion fungates giving rise to ulcerated form.\n\n【117】CLINICAL FEATURES.—\n\n【118】(i) It may present as a lump or an ulcer.\n\n【119】(ii) It is a painful lesion.\n\n【120】(iii) Soon it invades bone.\n\n【121】(iv) The growth ultimately fungates.\n\n【122】(v) Regional lymph nodes are always involved.\n\n【123】(vi) Biopsy should be performed to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n【124】COMPLICATIONS.—\n\n【125】(i) Adequate resection of the growth alongwith  删除换行1 surrounding healthy tissue should be performed. This  删除换行1 entails excision of the maxilla in case of upper jaw or  删除换行1 excision of the mandible in case of lower jaw. The defect  删除换行1 is made good by grafting.\n\n【126】(ii) Radiotherapy may be tried in selected cases.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

So it is likely that， in humans also， a small number of natural Treg cells is sufficient for immune regulation， and Billy can make sufficient Treg cells that derive from his sister's bone marrow stem cells.\n\n【8】Answer 2\n\n【9】The 'conditioning leading up to a bone marrow transplant comprises treatment with cytotoxic drugs 删除25：<u></u> that kill all rapidly dividing cells， including the CD4 effectorT cells responsible for the uncontrolled inflammatory response in IPEX. As these cells are destroyed， the autoimmune response that they have produced will be dampened. Immunosuppressant drugs have the same effect in reducing the acti-vation and proliferation of T cells， and this is why they are used to treat IPEX and other autoimmune disorders.\n\n【10】Answer 3\n\n【11】Because IPEX patients are unable to downregulate the immune activation triggered by infections， their disease frequently flares up on exposure to pathogens and even after vaccination. IVIG is useful in forestalling infections or ameliorating their impact when they occur. Vaccination is contraindicated in IPEX patients because of the risk of disease flare-up.\n\n【12】Answer 4\n\n【13】Venous infusion of immunocompetent purified naive CD4 T cells into mice with severe immunodeficiency (for example， scid mice or Rag-deficient mice 删除25：<u></u>) results in colitis. Infusion of CD4 CD25 Treg cells into these recipients can both pre-vent and reverse the colitis. This suggests that CD4 CD25 Treg cells may have thera-peutic potential in human autoimmune diseases.\n\n【14】Answer 5\n\n【15】Patients with IL-2Ra deficiency present a clinical picture with similarities to IPEX. IL-2 signaling is essential for the maintenance of Treg cells. Therefore， Treg activity is deficient in the absence of IL-2， IL-2Ro (CD25)， or the transcription factor STAT5， which is important for transducing the IL-2 signal. This may explain the similarity of the symptoms of IL-2Ra deficiency to those of IPEX.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Anaphylactic shock is a life-threatening disorder that occurs when an allergen overactivates mast cells and basophils, leading to widespread release of his-tamines, serotonins, and other compounds stored in the granules of these immune cells. These compounds lead to vasodilation and leaky capillaries. The crosslinking of IgE receptors present on these cells causes the activation of these cell types. By blocking this cross reaction, the anaphylactic pathway can be stymied.  \nAnswer A is incorrect. γ Interferon is produced by T lymphocytes and, among other functions, activates tumoricidal macrophages.  \nAnswer C is incorrect. Endotoxin can directly activate Hageman factor, activating the coagulation cascade and leading to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). However, the mechanism of shock through anaphylaxis is not related to DIC.  \nAnswer D is incorrect. The C5a component of the complement cascade, activated by endotoxin, functions in neutrophil chemotaxis. This is not the mechanism involved in anaphylaxis.  \nAnswer E is incorrect. The cytokine interleukin-1, released by macrophages activated by endotoxin, causes fever. Fever is absent in anaphylaxis.  \nAnswer F is incorrect.

There was extensive erythema and desquamation in her groin and axillae leading to a diagnosis of staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS). This is an exfoliative toxin-mediated bacterial infection mainly affecting  删除换行1 children under the age of 5 years. Flexural areas of skin are classically involved; however,  删除换行1 the cutaneous involvement may become widespread. Children may have suffered a recent  删除换行1 bacterial infection of their ear or throat. Children with atopic eczema are frequently colonized by Staphylococcus aureus, of which 5 per cent of strains produce exotoxins which  删除换行1 are spread through the blood leading to widespread skin involvement by SSSS.\nChildren may be pyrexial and appear unwell; they do not want their skin to be touched  删除换行1 at the affected sites owing to tenderness/pain. Lateral pressure on affected skin can lead  删除换行1 to a positive Nikolsky’s sign (the superficial skin sloughs-off). Swabs from involved skin  删除换行1 usually isolate S. aureus; strain typing and identification of exotoxins can be carried out  删除换行1 if the diagnosis is in doubt. Interestingly, blood cultures are usually negative in children.\nThis child’s skin swabs also isolated Pseudomonas, which is an opportunistic secondary  删除换行1 colonizer of eroded skin.\nThe patient was admitted to hospital and treated with oral flucloxacillin (intravenous  删除换行1 lines should be avoided in patients with fragile/infected skin if possible) plus topical  删除换行1 combination fusidic acid and hydrocortisone. She washed in a mild chlorhexidine lotion  删除换行1 as the pain settled.This child had several episodes of SSSS over a few months.

He states that the pain is worse when he tries to lift his arm and he has difficulty keeping his arm elevated for more than a few seconds. He denies any falls or trauma to the arm or shoulder. His right hand is dominant. On examination, he has minor pain on palpation of the right shoulder. The pain is increased with abduction of his arm greater than 90°. Additionally, he is unable to hold his arm in an abducted position and has weakness with external rotation. Following injection of lidocaine in the joint, his pain disappears, but the weakness continues.\n\n【3】 What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n【4】 What anatomical structure is involved?\n\n【5】### ANSWER TO CASE 57 :\n\n【6】#### Rotator Cuff Tear\n\n【7】Summary: A 64-year-old man with no previous trauma is complaining of chronic pain and weakness in his dominant arm. He has pain with abduction in addition to weakness with external rotation on examination. Injection of a local anesthetic relieves his pain but not help the weakness that he has been experiencing.\n\n【8】• Most likely diagnosis: Rotator cuff tear\n\n【9】• Anatomical structure likely involved: The rotator cuff, which consists of the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis muscles\n\n【10】### CLINICAL CORRELATION\n\n【11】This elderly man has the typical findings of a rotator cuff tear. Although some patients may be asymptomatic, common complaints include pain and weakness with abduction. Rotator cuff injuries are very common, especially in patients over the age of 40. The rotator cuff may be torn acutely, such as with trauma, or it may be a chronic issue, with both degeneration secondary to age and repetitive stress contributing. The rotator cuff stabilizes the glenohumeral joint and facilitates various arm movements. The supraspinatus contributes to abduction of the arm, especially early abduction. The infraspinatus and teres minor are external rotators. The subscapularis rotates the arm internally. Lidocaine injection is helpful for diagnosis as it distinguishes rotator cuff tendinopathy from a tear. Lidocaine relieves pain in both injuries, but will improve strength in only tendinopathy.\n\n【12】### APPROACH TO:\n\n【13】#### Scapulohumeral Muscles (Intrinsic Shoulder Muscles)\n\n【14】### OBJECTIVES\n\n【15】1\\.

Be able to understand the features of the shoulder joint\n\n【18】### DISCUSSION\n\n【19】There are two groups of muscles surrounding the glenohumeral (shoulder) joint: axioappendicular muscles (extrinsic shoulder muscles) and scapulohumeral muscles (intrinsic shoulder muscles). The extrinsic muscles (total nine muscles) connect the upper limb to the trunk; the six intrinsic shoulder muscles (deltoid, teres major, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis) originate from the pectoral girdle (scapula and clavicle), insert to the humerus, and act on the shoulder joint. Four of the intrinsic shoulder muscles (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis) are referred to as rotator cuff muscles 删除25：<u></u> because their muscle fibers and tendons surround the capsule of the shoulder joint to form the musculotendinous rotator cuff 删除33：<u></u>.\n删除4：<u>Table 57-1 • ROTATOR CUFF MUSCLES</u>\n\n【20】删除3：<u>Figure 57-1. Muscles, tendons, and ligaments of the shoulder joint (lateral view). \\[ Reproduced , with permission, from Lindner HH. Clinical Anatomy. East Norwalk, CT: Appleton & Lange , 1989:528 删除33：<u></u> . \\]</u>\n\n【21】The shoulder joint is a ball-and-socket synovial joint consisting of the large head of the humerus and small glenoid fossa of the scapula that fosters the mobility of the joint but also makes it relatively unstable.\n\n【22】The tendon of the s upraspinatus crosses over the capsule superiorly, the tendons of the i nfraspinatus and the t eres minor cross over the capsule posteriorly, and the tendon of the s ubscapularis crosses over the capsule anteriorly; these tendons (SITS) reinforce the joint capsule from three directions to protect the joint and give it stability.\n\n【23】Between the tendons of the rotator cuff muscles and the joint capsule are the bursae , which contain synovial fluid to reduce friction during muscle contractions. Most of the bursae directly communicate with the cavity of the shoulder joint.\n\n【24】Lesions or degeneration of the rotator cuff and related bursae are common causes of pain in the shoulder area.\n\n【25】###", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medical_case_handled", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}
